A mechanical engineer by trade, he was the \\"cousin-brother\\" and business partner of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in the Carnegie Steel Company. The two were among the richest people in the world during their lifetimes with Lauders fortune valued at roughly $19 billion (in 2018 dollars). The sale of Carnegie Steel to J.P. Morgan in 1901 created U.S. Steel where Lauder sat on the board of directors. This became the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion ($ billion today). Early years George Lauder was the son of George Lauder, Sr. and Seaton Morrison. His father owned the general store on the local high street in Dunfermline. George Sr. was better known in Scotland for his commitment to Scottish nationalism, an egalitarian democracy, and the Chartism cause. He was a keen radical for the time, championing the preservation of human and public rights which led to the Reform Acts of 1836. After his wife Seaton died young, Lauder Sr. became instrumental in the upbringing of his only son George and his nephew Andrew Carnegie. Lauder Jr. and Carnegie were two years apart in age and best friends as a result of their shared experiences. They affectionately referred to one another as \\"Dod\\" and \\"Naig\\" (respectively), due to their mutual inability to fully say each other's names as young children. After Andrew and his family left for America, George stayed in Scotland where he would go on to graduate from Glasgow University with a degree in mechanical engineering while studying under Lord Kelvin.  Business life  Andrew Carnegie, George Lauder, and Thomas Miller in 1862. Taken in Glasgow, Scotland. In 1873, Carnegie wrote to Lauder, who, despite still living in Scotland had never ceased to be his closest confidant and advisor. Carnegie inquired about a term used in a contract for the steel to be used for the new Eads Bridge in St. Louis, Missouri. The term unknown to Carnegie was 'the modulus of elasticity' of Elastic modulus. Lauder, an academic, answered swiftly and capably helping Carnegie close the contract. This provoked Carnegie to ask Lauder to join him in America as a partner in the Carnegie Steel Corporation. Lauder accepted and joined Carnegie, Carnegie's brother (and also Lauder's cousin) Thomas M. Carnegie, Henry Phipps, Jr., and Henry Clay Frick in Pittsburgh. Lauder brought a new dynamic to the business with his formal education, and expertise in, mechanical engineering. Surprisingly, this level of training was unique among the partners of the business‚Äîmost of whom had learned the business as they went and none of whom had technical training of any kind. Lauder brought several new developments to the steel industry in America. This included inventing the process for washing and coking dross from coal mines resulting in a significant increase to profits and the overall value of the business. This became industry-standard world- wide in the production of steel. Lauder would also go on to lead the development of the use of steel in armor and armaments which had been a business Carnegie balked at entering until President Benjamin Harrison personally appealed to him. Lauder and Charles M. Schwab would spend significant time at the Krupp factory in Germany in 1886 before returning to build the massive armor plate mill at the Homestead Steel Works that would revolutionize warfare forever. By the turn of the twentieth century, Lauder was a director of Carnegie Steel, ran both the coke and ore businesses, and was the company's second largest shareholder after Carnegie. After over thirty years as a senior member of the syndicate, Lauder was seen as the \\"balance wheel\\" for his moderate and cautious counsel and the lone \\"brake\\" for his often impulsive cousin Carnegie. Partner Daniel Clemson referred to Lauder as a \\"father figure\\" to the rest of the company. After the successful sale of Carnegie Steel Company to J.P. Morgan which lead to the formation of U.S. Steel in 1901, Lauder joined the board of directors of the new company. It became the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization exceeding US$1 Billion.  Marriage and Issue  George Lauder married Anna Maria Romeyn Varick in 1877. His wife, a member of old Dutch New York Society, was a descendant from many key figures in the creation and development of New York City. Her ancestors include Joris Jansen Rapelje who was among the earliest settlers of New Netherland in 1623 and a member of the Council of Twelve Men‚Äîthe first democratic institution in the future United States. She was also a descendant of Richard Varick, the second post-colonial (and 45th overall) Mayor of New York City. George and Anna Maria had three children together, Harriet, George III. and Elizabeth. Their daughter Harriet married Dr. James C. Greenway combining the Lauder and Greenway families into what is now known as the Lauder Greenway Family. Together, they gifted the endowment that created the Yale School of Public Health. They also purchased what would become the Lauder Greenway Estate in Greenwich. Through them, the senior Lauders' grandchildren include ornithologist James Cowan Greenway and G. Lauder Greenway, who led the Metropolitan Opera Association. Their son George Lauder III was a high-profile sailor who set the record in 1900 (held until 1905) for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing with his yacht, Endymion. Through him, the senior Lauders' grandchildren included Polly Lauder Tunney, who would marry reigning world heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney. Through them, Lauders' great grandchildren include U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator John V. Tunney.  Family Estate  Aerial view of the estate George Lauder lived out the last eleven years of his life as a widower at the Lauder Greenway Estate in Greenwich, Connecticut. Built for industrialist John Hamilton Gourlie in 1896, it was purchased by Lauder's daughter Harriet in 1905. At the time of purchase, the estate included 57 acres and included fruit-bearing orchards, a chicken and pig farm, as well as the French Renaissance mansion, to which the family added two wings in the early 1910s and expanded the estate to over 100 acres.

Web. 22 Oct. 2012. Altruistic voting has been compared to purchasing a lottery ticket, in which the probability of winning is extremely low but the payoff is large enough that the expected benefit outweighs the cost.Jankowski, Richard. \\"Buying a Lottery Ticket to Help the Poor: Altruism, Civic Duty, and Self-interest in the Decision to Vote.\\" Rationality and Society 14.1 (2002): 55‚Äì77. Sage Journals. Web. 20 Oct. 2012. Since the failure of standard rational choice models‚Äîwhich assume voters have \\"selfish\\" preferences‚Äîto explain voter turnout in large elections, public choice economists and social scientists have increasingly turned to altruism as a way to explain why rational individuals would choose to vote despite its apparent lack of individual benefit, the so-called paradox of voting. The theory suggests that individual voters do, in fact, derive personal utility from influencing the outcome of elections in favor of the candidate that they believe will implement policies for the greater good of the entire population.Fowler, James H. \\"Altruism and Turnout.\\" The Journal of Politics 68.3 (2006): 673‚Äì83. JSTOR. Web. 20 Oct. 2012. The rational calculus of voting The \\"selfish\\" rationale for voting The standard model of voter calculus was articulated by Riker and Ordeshook in their 1968 article \\"A Theory of the Calculus of Voting\\" in The American Political Science Review.Riker, William H., and Peter Ordeshook. \\"A Theory of the Calculus of Voting.\\" The American Political Science Review 62.1 (1968): 25‚Äì42. JSTOR. Web. 20 Nov. 2012. The basic utility hypothesis for the calculus of voting they gave was: :R = (BP) ‚àí C Where B is the expected differential utility a voter personally receives from his preferred candidate winning; P is the probability of the voter bringing about B (that is, turning the election for his preferred candidate); C is the individual's cost of voting in the election; and R is the individuals expected reward from voting. If R > 0, then the expected utility of voting outweighs its costs, and it is reasonable to vote. But if R ‚â§ 0, the costs outweigh the benefits and a strictly rational individual would not be expected to vote. Because P, the probability of any one vote determining the outcome, is extremely small for any large election, the expected benefits of voting under the traditional rational choice model is always roughly equal to zero. This leads to the so-called paradox of voting, in which rational choice models of voter behavior predict tiny turnouts which simply do not occur. In all democracies, voter turnout exceeds what the basic rational choice models predict. =Expressive versus instrumental voting= Because simple selfishness cannot explain why large numbers of people consistently choose to vote, Riker and Ordeshook introduced another term to the equation, D, to symbolize the personal or social benefits conferred by the act of voting itself, rather than by affecting the outcome of the election. :R = (BP) ‚àí C + D This drew a distinction between expressive voting, intended only to signal support or demonstrate civic responsibility, and instrumental voting, intended to actually change the outcome. The benefits here did not come from actually influencing the election, but rather from the social payoffs of participating in it. Because the term BP was assumed to be zero, D was presumed to be the only important factor in determining elections.Hamlin , Alan, and Colin Jennings. \\"Expressive Political Behaviour: Foundations, Scope and Implications.\\" British Journal of Political Science. 41.3 (2011): 645‚Äì670. Web. 22 Oct. 2012. The \\"altruistic\\" rationale for voting Because of the multitude of different and contradictory definitions of expressive voting, recently another effort by political scientists and public choice theorists has been made to explain voting behavior with reference to instrumental benefits received from influencing the outcome of the election. If voters assumed to be rational but also to have altruistic tendencies and some preference for outcomes enhancing the social welfare of others, they will reliably vote in favor of the policies they perceive to be for the common good, rather than for their individual benefit. In his paper \\"Altruism and Turnout,\\" James H. Fowler explained how the altruistic theory modified the calculus of voting: :Scholars incorporate altruism into the traditional calculus of voting model by assuming that a citizen also cares about the benefits that others secure from the preferred outcome (Edlin, Gelman, and Kaplan 2006; Jankowski 2002, 2004). Under this assumption, B is a function not only of direct benefits to oneself BS, but to the N other people affected by the outcome of the election who would gain an average benefit BO if the citizen‚Äôs preferred alternative won. It also depends on how much the citizen cares about benefits to others, which is labeled a for altruism. :These assumptions transform the calculus of voting to P(BS + aNBO) > C. :...There is by now a substantial literature in economics, sociology, biology, psychology, and political science yielding evidence that human beings are also motivated by the welfare of others (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Monroe 1998; Piliavin and Charng 1990). Specifically, people frequently engage in acts of altruism by choosing to bear costs in order to provide benefits to others. Essentially, voters behave altruistically by absorbing the cost of voting in order to provide society with the benefits of their preferred policy, although the expected reward of voting under this model is greater than zero (and thus still a rational decision) because of voters' altruistic social preferences. Edlin, et al., found in their study of altruistic behavior among voters, :... [F]or an individual with both selfish and social preferences, the social preferences will dominate and make it rational for a typical person to vote even in large elections;(2) to show that rational socially-motivated voting has a feedback mechanism that stabilizes turnout at reasonable levels (e.g., 50% of the electorate)... Their findings suggest that in a large election, altruistic preferences will trump selfish tendencies, thus encouraging a stable voter turnout that closely mirrors the observed rate in western democracies. Voter's altruistic preferences In his 2007 book The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies, George Mason University economist Bryan Caplan argued that, all else equal, voters do not, in fact, choose policies based on self-interest. The rich are not more likely to support policies that personally benefit them, like lower marginal rates, and the poor are not more likely to oppose welfare reform.Bryan Caplan. The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies, Princeton University Press, 2007. Print. He claims that what he calls the \\"Self-Interest Voter Hypothesis\\" (SIVH), the theory that individuals' policy preferences are narrowly selfish, is empirically wrong. In response to U.S. Republican candidate Mitt Romney's remarks about the \\"47%\\" of Americans who will \\"always\\" vote Democrat because they are dependent on the welfare state, Caplan writes, :Wrong, wrong, wrong. The 47% won't vote for Obama \\"no matter what.\\" Almost half of voters who earn less than the median income vote Republican in the typical election. A person doesn't support the nanny state because he wants government to take care of him; a person supports the nanny state because he wants government to take care of us.Caplan, Bryan. \\"Will False Belief in the SIVH Destroy Romney's Candidacy?\\" EconLog. Library of Economics and Liberty, 18 Sept. 2012. Web. 20 Oct. 2012. Caplan says that voters consistently demonstrate preferences that are not clearly related to self-interest, and they are motivated primarily by what they believe is best for the country. Rational irrationality Related to the public choice concept of rational ignorance, Caplan proposes the concept of \\"rational irrationality\\" as an explanation for why the average voter holds views that are persistently and systematically contradictory to the consensus view of expert economists. His thesis is that indulging innate cognitive biases (of which he identifies four as being major contributors to bad economic policy positions) is psychologically gratifying, while overcoming natural prejudices through training, education, and skepticism, is psychologically costly. Therefore, when the personal benefit giving in to our biases is greater than the personal cost suffered from acting on them, individuals will tend to rationally indulge in irrational behavior, like voting for protectionist tariffs and other economically damaging but socially popular policies. These views tend not to be related to the particular voter in any rationally self-interested way, and so voters are genuinely not being subject to any direct economic penalties for choosing irrational policies. The altruistic voter will indulge, without restraint, in make-work bias, anti-foreign bias, pessimistic bias, and anti- market bias, all in the hopes of better his fellow man through the ballot box. Criticisms and modifications * A 2008 study of voters in Sweden during the 1990s found significant evidence for self-interested \\"pocketbook\\" voting. The authors found that voters can and will respond to direct promises of personal economic benefits, although it appears that citizens respond almost entirely to the prospective promises of politicians but not to the actual implementation of those policies.Elinder , Mikael, Henrik Jordahl, and Panu Poutvaara. \\"Selfish and Prospective: Theory and Evidence of Pocketbook Voting.\\" Institute for the Study of Labor Discussion Paper Series. 3763 (2008): n. page. Web. 22 Oct. 2012. * George Mason Law Professor Tun-Jen Chiang criticized the Edlin altruist model as overly simplistic and ultimately naive about voter preferences. Chiang presents an alternative model of altruist voting behavior, centered around voters' selective altruism towards favored racial, cultural, religious, regional, sexual, economic, or social groups (of which they may or may not be a member). He contends that, even if two candidates policies had identical social welfare benefits overall, ::It is rational to vote as long as the candidates differ in their effect on the welfare of subsets of the population, and one happens to be particularly concerned with an affected subset. For example, if a candidate proposed to take wealth from the richer half of the population and distribute it to the poorer half, and the redistribution created no overall effects, a voter under the broad altruism model would have no incentive to vote. However, if a voter cared particularly for the welfare of the poor, that voter would have an incentive to vote for the candidate; similarly, a voter that cared particular for the welfare of the rich would have an incentive to vote against the candidate. The result in my model is that both such voters would be rationally motivated to vote.Chiang, Tun-Jen. \\"Unequal Altruism and the Voting Paradox.\\" George Mason University Law and Economics Research Paper Series. 12‚Äì36 (2012): n. page.

It was screened at the 17th Busan International Film Festival, the Mumbai Film Festival, and the International Film Festival of Kerala, where it won the Silver Crow Pheasant Award for best debut. It won the Best Feature Film in Hindi in the 60th National Film Awards 2012. Filmistaan was screened internationally at the 24th Palm Springs International Film Festival, 23rd Troms√∏ International Film Festival, 36th G√∂teborg International Film Festival, and 5th Jaipur International Film Festival. It was released nationwide across India on June 6, 2014. Plot In Mumbai, an affable Bollywood buff and wanna-be-actor Suneet (\\"Sunny\\"), who works as an assistant director, fantasizes on becoming a heart-throb star. However, at every audition he is summarily thrown out. Undeterred, he goes with an American crew to remote areas in Rajasthan to work on a documentary. While filming near the India-Pakistan border, the crew encounters Indian police officers patrolling the area. After the American director unsuccessfully argues that he has obtained official permission to film anywhere in Rajasthan, Sunny entertains the chief officer and plays to his desire to be exalted and filmed. Impressed and in a happy mood, the officer allows the crew to continue their work. Later in the night, as Sunny is busy changing the tire of his car, the rest of the crew leaves in another vehicle. On his drive back, he encounters a cyclist lying on the road and checks him out, but soon realizes from the shadows that it's a ruse. A terrorist Muslim Jihadist group kidnaps him and brings him and his camera equipment to Pakistan. The group leader is disappointed that their original plan to kidnap an American crew-member didn't occur. He says that holding an American hostage would force the government to meet his demands to avoid international backlash, but an Indian hostage would be worthless. He instructs Mehmood and Jawaad to keep him hostage in a village while the others attempt another kidnapping. Sunny wakes up to find himself in an unfamiliar house. He demands to be let go, but after Mehmood gives him the opportunity to walk out, he stays realizing they will kill him if he did. The house where he is confined belongs to Aftaab, a Pakistani Muslim whose trade stems from pirated Hindi films, which he brings back every time he crosses the border. Aftaab gets enamored by Sunny's camera equipment as he too loves movies. Aftaab plays Sunny's favorite film Maine Pyaar Kiya from a pirated DVD for the villagers to watch. Sunny wants to watch it too, but Mehmood doesn't allow him to leave. Sunny loudly mimics the dialogues of the film in his room and this forces Mehmood to let him join the villagers and watch it. As Sunny helps fill in for the muted dialog of the pirated DVD, Aftaab starts forging a bond with him. A few days later, a messenger of the group leader arrives with a digital camera and the leader's demand for a hostage video. As none of the group members knows how to operate the camera, Sunny steps in and offers to direct the shot himself. He does several takes as he is repeatedly disappointed with each take and attempting to do better in the next. At first he tried shots with just himself, then with two gunmen pointing guns at him, and finally with Mehmood making the demand himself on-camera. Satisfied with the last take with Mehmood, they return to the village and send off the messenger with the video. One day while Jawaad is taking a shower, Sunny walks around the area and picks up his gun. He gathers the village children and entertains them with mimicry of how Bollywood actors would shoot their guns. Mehmood and Jawaad sneak up on him thinking he is attempting to escape. Though Mehmood has a clear shot to kill Sunny, he realizes that Sunny is just entertaining the kids but shoots a bullet to graze Sunny's arm to teach him a lesson. The physician who cleaned up the wound and gave Sunny medicines talks about his desire to visit Amritsar as he used to before the partition of India and Pakistan. Sunny tells him that he reminds him of his grandfather who also wanted to visit Lahore as he once could. After learning that India is playing against Pakistan in a cricket match, Sunny makes a deal with Mehmood that he would allow him to leave if India wins. The villagers gathered around a truck's radio to hear the match. Though it appeared that Pakistan had a chance, India wins with a six-run hit. Sunny is thrilled and starts dancing, much to the dismay of the villagers. But soon Mehmood is enraged and attempts to destroy his camera equipment. Sunny holds on to the camera to prevent Mehmood from destroying it, and gets slapped hard several times before Jawaad stepped in and stopped him. The Pakistani border patrol arrives at the village, causing Mehmood to suspect that Aftaab had tipped them off. However, Aftaab convinces them that they are just patrolling and gets them to hide. Sunny tries to make himself known to the patrol, but Aftaab tells him that he would either be killed as an Indian spy or put in prison. Aftaab entertains the patrol officers, gives some pirated DVDs to the chief officer and sends them off. Mehmood gains more trust in Aftaab, while Aftaab grows closer to Sunny and they share their passion for Bollywood movies. Aftaab hopes that Pakistan's Lollywood would also make similar blockbuster movies that Bollywood wants to copy, instead of the B-movies it currently makes. Aftaab promises to help Sunny escape with his knowledge of the border. They devise a plan where they will invite men of the village to audition for a movie. While shooting a scene for the movie, they enact an escape scene together, raising suspicion of Mehmood but soon dispelling it when they returned. After the scenes were shot, the villages including some women in black burqa are leaving. Jawaad finds a watch in the sand and returns it to one of the villagers. But later he realizes it is Sunny's watch and Sunny had escaped in a burqa. Aftaab and Sunny attempt to escape on a motorbike but are soon stopped by Mehmood. He locks both of them up after Aftaab promises to help Sunny escape as long as he is alive, and questions why people like Mehmood are destroying Pakistan in the name of Allah. When the terrorist group leader arrives at the village, Aftaab's father pleads with him to let Sunny go. He reluctantly agrees realizing that the village could turn against them if he didn't oblige. Mehmood and Jawaad bring Aftaab and Sunny to a barren land near the border. Mehmood stops the vehicle and claiming that he has orders, he prepares to kill Aftaab and Sunny. However, Jawaad disbelieving him points his gun at Mehmood. After a verbal argument between the two, Mehmood swings his gun to shoot Jawaad but is shot down and falls dead. Jawaad tells both Sunny and Aftaab to escape, saying Aftaab would be killed in Pakistan as a traitor. The group leader soon arrives and kills a desolate Jawaad who was waiting on his knees for his fate. Sunny and Aftaab wait near the border for the patrol officers to leave, then start running towards the border. The group leader and his assistant catch up with them and start shooting at them. When they hide out behind a grass-patch, Aftaab urges Sunny to escape while he holds them off, but Sunny refuses to leave without him. They again run towards the border while bullets were fired at them but missed, with the interlaced public dialogues of Mohammed Ali Jinnah and Jawaharlal Nehru in the background. The film closes with them crossing the border milestone and Aftaab turning around to shoot back at the terrorists.

The five blocks are the Mount Sanford (Cheshire, Hamden‚Äîbordering Prospect and Bethany), East (Beacon Falls, Bethany, Naugatuck), West (Naugatuck, Oxford, Beacon Falls), Quillinan Reservoir (Seymour, Ansonia), and Great Hill (Seymour) blocks. History The first purchases of lands which comprise the Naugatuck State Forest were made by Harris Whittemore in 1921. Whittemore, a Connecticut State Forest and Park Commissioner and industrial magnate, intended to donate the forest parcels to the state but died in 1928 before he could do so. In 1931, in memoriam, Whittemore's family donated nearly 2,000 acres (which included additional parcels acquired after his death). The other blocks were added afterwards with the Great Hill block having been added most recently. A scenic valley consisting of the parallel Naugatuck River and Connecticut Route 8 splits the East and West block's rising hills in Naugatuck. Most of the Naugatuck State Forest blocks are in the Naugatuck River watershed whose sources and mouth are entirely within the limits of Connecticut and which is itself a tributary of the lower Housatonic River. The towns in the Naugatuck Valley area were settled during the early part of the 18th century and were typical of the early New England settlements. Rivers, streams and ponds were dammed to furnish waterpower for gristmills, tanneries, and later paper mills. There are many stone fences marking the boundaries of colonial era farms though large portions of the Naugatuck State Forest blocks are composed of rocky hills which made poor farmland. Activities Early fall leaves on Quillinan's White Trail \\"singletrack\\" near the former NIKE missile site in Ansonia, Connecticut between Moulthrap Brook, Twomile Brook and Osborne Lane. Naugatuck State Forest is used for fishing, hiking, hunting, target shooting, snowmobiling, cross country skiing, mountain biking, climbing, geocaching and trail running. The forest is crossed by several Blue-Blazed Trails including the Quinnipiac Trail and Naugatuck Trail (including the Whittemore spur). Mountain biking trails include fire roads in the various blocks, as well as several miles of singletrack trail in the Quillinan Block that were created in cooperation of the DEEP State Forester's office, the New England Mountain Bike Association (NEMBA), and Thule Corporation.

She was tried in Lublin, Poland at the Majdanek Trials and sentenced to death for war crimes. Ehrich was hanged on 26 October 1948. She was an Oberaufseherin at Majdanek, and took active part in all the major selections to the gas chambers and executions. She maltreated prisoners, including children. Her assistant was reportedly Hermine Braunsteiner, who was later denaturalized and deported from the United States back to Germany. Background Ehrich was born in Bredereiche. She worked in a slaughterhouse. On 15 August 1940, she volunteered for service in the concentration camp Ravensbr√ºck as an SS guard. From 1941, Ehrich worked as a SS-Rapportf√ºhrerin (Rapport Leader). In October 1942, she was transferred to Majdanek near Lublin, where after some time she was promoted to SS-Oberaufseherin. She was under the SS command in the camp. Ehrich is believed responsible for the death of thousands of prisoners (including in gas chambers), from the women's section of the camp with children. During the 34 months of camp operation, more than 79,000 prisoners were murdered at the main camp alone (59,000 of them Polish Jews) and between 95,000 and 130,000 people in the entire Majdanek system of subcamps. On 3 November 1943, around 18,000 Jews were killed at Majdanek during the largest single-day, single-camp massacre of the Holocaust, named Harvest Festival (totaling 43,000 with 2 subcamps). In February 1943, Ehrich became ill due to typhoid. On 5 April 1944, she was the Oberaufseherin in the Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp, and from June 1944 to April 1945, she was assigned to Neuengamme. After the war, in May 1945, she was arrested in Hamburg and stayed in the camp for war criminals PWE29 in Dachau, where she shared the cell with Maria Mandl. She was transferred to the Polish authorities. In 1948, she stood before the District Court of Lublin at the second Majdanek Trials, accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ehrich was found guilty of the allegations and on 10 June 1948, was condemned to death by hanging. After the announcement of the judgment, she asked the Polish President for clemency, on the grounds that she had a small son and wanted to atone for her guilt. President Bierut rejected the request. Ehrich was executed on 26 October 1948 in Lublin prison.

It is known from well-preserved skull and cervical vertebrae which were collected in the lower part of the Morrison Formation. The type and only species is Kaatedocus siberi, described in 2012 by Emanuel Tschopp and Oct√°vio Mateus. History Skull SMA 0004 from two angles In 1934, a team of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) headed by Barnum Brown, financed by the Sinclair Oil Corporation, uncovered about three thousand sauropod bones on the land of rancher Barker Howe near Shell, in Big Horn County. Plans for further excavations in 1935 had to be cancelled after Howe, convinced by the large publicity surrounding the find that the remains were very valuable, demanded higher payment. The bones would not be described and most of them were lost in a fire at the AMNH during the 1940s; other were thrown away in the 1960s after having rotted because of being stowed in a chicken run at Shell. Only about 10% of the fossils survived, among them a skull. They were generally interpreted as belonging to Barosaurus. In 1989 the site was reopened by Hans-Jakob Siber, the founder of the Swiss Aathal Dinosaur Museum. His team immediately adjacent to the old How Quarry discovered another 450 bones that became part of the collection of the Swiss museum. Size comparison with a human The finds included an exceptionally complete neck. In Switzerland, this became the subject of several lines of scientific investigation. In 2005 Daniela Schwarz studied the pneumatisation of the vertebrae by tomography scanning them with neutrons and X-rays. In 2010 Andreas Christian used the well-preserved vertebrae to support his hypothesis that sauropod necks were held in a rather upright position,Christian, A. & Dzemski, G., 2011, \\"Neck posture in sauropods\\", pp: 251‚Äì260 in: Klein, N., Remes, K., Gee, C. G. & Sander, P. M. (eds.). Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: Understanding the life of giants. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 2011 which was confirmed by Armin Schmitt studying the vestibular system of Kaatedocus. In 2012 Tschopp used a scan to create a replica of the neck by means of a 3D-printer.Emanuel Tschopp & Gordon Dzemski, 2012, \\"3-Dimensional Reproduction Techniques to Preserve and Spread Paleontological Material ‚Äì a Case Study with a Diplodocid Sauropod Neck\\", Journal of Paleontological Techniques 10 During the intense study of the fossils it became clear that they did not represent Barosaurus but a species new to science. In 2012 this was named Kaatedocus siberi, by the Swiss palaeontologist Emanuel Tschopp, who as a boy had visited the excavations, and his Portuguese colleague Oct√°vio Mateus. The generic name, which means \\"small beam\\", combines a reference to the related form Diplodocus with a Crow Indian diminutive suffix ~kaate. The specific name honours Siber.

Some of the deceived returnees appealed to Russian immigrants not to believe the Bolshevik's assurances and seek protection from Commissioner for Refugees under the League of Nations, Fridtjof Nansen. This led to creation of Nansen passport, which was recognized by 31 states, where more than 25,000 Russians have settled. Many Soviet spies had connections with Unions for repatriation.

Origin of the phrase  The term St. Tibb (or Tib) is attributed a character appearing in 17th-century English plays. The character portrays a loose-moraled woman and was used for comic relief. The word was also used to describe a \\"wanton\\" as in epigrammist Richard Turner's ‚ÄúNosce Te (Humours)\\" written in 1607: > \\"They wondred much at Tom, but at Tib more, \\"Faith (quoth the vicker) 'tis > an exlent whore.\\" Folklorist Philip Hiscock notes: > In jokes and plays four centuries ago, Tib often referred to a girl with > loose morals, so there was no Saint Tib and therefore no Tib's Eve. To say > something would happen on Tib's Eve was to say it would never happen. Tibb's Eve was a \\"non-time\\"; if something was said to happen on Tibb's Eve, it was unlikely it would ever happen. This is illustrated in a 1902 editorial: > The other day I was conversing with a man about a prospective event. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù > said he, ‚Äúit will be on Tib‚Äôs Eve, neither before nor after Christmas,‚Äù > expressing thus his incredulity as to the function ever coming off. Similar phrases exist like \\"the twelfth of never\\", February 30th or \\"when two Mondays fall together,\\" however Tibb's Eve has become associated with the Christmas season. There are several records of this phrase in use in the Ulster dialect of Northern Ireland. In 1903 it was recorded with unknown origins and meaning \\"a day that would never come.\\" In 1904, the phrase was included on a list of words in the Ulster dialect used in the Midland and Northwestern Counties as \\"a festival not to be found in the Calendar. Used as an evasion, as it is said to occur neither before nor after Christmas.\\" The expression \\"Saint Tibb's Eve\\" is recorded in Cornwall, also meaning \\"a day which never comes.\\" > There is one saint whose name is familiar to all in Cornwall, but whose sex > is unknown. This saint has much to answer for; promises made, but never > intended to be kept, are all to be fulfilled on next St. Tibb's eve, a day > that some folks say \\" falls between the old and new year\\"; others describe > it as one that comes \\"neither before nor after Christmas.\\" The phrase appears to have traveled across the Atlantic with immigrants to Newfoundland and Labrador. Story refers to Tibb's Eve \\"generally 'neither before nor after Christmas,' i.e. never\\" as an Anglo-Irish Term in Newfoundland English dialect. The use continued in the province for a time: > Tibb‚Äôs Eve was traditionally used in Newfoundland vernacular as a > unspecified date that didn‚Äôt exist. If you asked someone when they were > going to pay you back the money they owed you they might answer ‚ÄúOn Tibb‚Äôs > Eve‚Äù meaning that you probably won‚Äôt see that money again. As a holiday The use of Tibb's Eve, Tip's Eve, Tipp's Eve, or Tipsy Eve are regional variations used throughout Newfoundland and Labrador to describe the same celebration. > Eventually, proverbial explanations arose as to when this non-existent Tibs > Eve was: \\"Neither before nor after Christmas\\" was one. \\"Between the old year > and the new\\" was another. Thus, the day became associated with the Christmas > season. Sometime around World War II, people along the south coast of Newfoundland began to associate Dec. 23 with the phrase ‚ÄòTibb‚Äôs Eve‚Äô and deemed it the first night during Advent when it was appropriate to have a drink. Advent was a sober, religious time of year and traditionally people would not drink alcohol until Christmas Day at the earliest. Tibb's Eve emerged as an excuse to imbibe two days earlier. > For some people, Tib's Eve is the beginning of the Christmas season. > Observed on December 23rd and sometimes called Tip's Eve or Tipsy Eve, it's > one of several extensions of the holidays. For many Newfoundlanders, this > day is the official opening of Christmas, the first chance to drink the > Christmas stash. The date of Tib's Eve is only known in Newfoundland. The tradition of celebrating Tibb's Eve may be similar to 19th century workers taking Saint Monday off from work. Expatriate Newfoundlanders have spread the tradition to other parts of Canada, such as Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2019, comedian Colin Hollett described the holiday this way for a Halifax newspaper: > Tibb‚Äôs Eve on December 23, when people drink and eat at kitchen parties and > bars with all the people they want to celebrate with before spending time > with those they have to. I have no idea how that isn‚Äôt huge everywhere else.  Pseudo Etymology  Tibb's Eve is sometimes referred to as Tipp's Eve, Tip's Eve, or Tipsy Eve. A popular contemporary legend or folk etymology maintains that these names are attributed to the word tipple, which is a verb meaning to drink intoxicating liquor, especially habitually or to some excess. For example, > The more contemporary explanation of St. Tibb‚Äôs comes from the association > of the day with a Christmas tipple. In the 1500‚Äôs if you were to go out for > a drink you went to a ‚Äútipple‚Äù or alehouse and were served by a ‚Äútippler‚Äù > the alehouse keeper. In Newfoundland ‚Äì St. Tibb‚Äôs became ‚Äì the first real > occasion to taste the home brew, a day where the men would visit each > other‚Äôs homes for a taste. This use is reinforced with examples from the Dictionary of Newfoundland English. Christopher Perry of Daniel's Harbour, Newfoundland and Labrador says: > I've always assumed that the name Tipsey Eve originated from this custom of > the men going from house to house on the afternoon of December 23rd to test > or taste each other's brew. Whether it did or not, when they returned home > in the late evening or at night they were usually quite tipsey... Edie Smith from Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador explains where she believes the name comes from: > Christmas really starts in my home on Tipps Eve which is the day before > Christmas. I have heard that it is called Tipps Eve because when men used to > put up their own homebrew etc. they wouldn't drink it before Christmas but I > guess most men would sneak a drink or two on this day because they felt the > Christmas was close and they probably got a bit tipsy thus Tipps Eve. It is likely that the name originated from the use of Tibb's Eve as neither before nor after Christmas, and through folk etymology and pronunciation shift, the phrase became linked with the concept of tipsy or tipple. As William Kirwin says, > Folk etymology, strictly speaking, should be a re-formation of a strangely > pronounced or spelled form with the result that the new term makes plausible > sense.

Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forces under the command of Gabriel Wojni≈Ç≈Çowicz defeated the Swedish forces, supported by their Polish allies under Colonel Aleksander Pracki. The battle was regarded as a symbol of Polish resistance to the invaders, as it was first Polish victory since the Swedish invasion of summer 1655. In November 1655, when Swedish forces reached Krosno, the town opened its gates to the invaders. The sejmik of the Przemysl Land, which convened here, pledged allegiance to Charles Gustav. Soon afterwards, however, residents of Krosno saw the real face of the Swedes, who looted, plundered, murdered people and burned houses. Organized by Colonel Gabriel Wojni≈Ç≈Çowicz, they renounced their pledge and attacked Swedish garrison, together with their Polish allies. Surprised Swedes lost the battle, and the Poles recaptured the town. Traitors, together with Pracki, were hanged in the market square, while Wojni≈Ç≈Çowicz with his unit headed towards Biecz and Nowy SƒÖcz.

Patterson was a court case heard before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals which held that contacts and contracts negotiated through the Internet with a party in a different state were sufficient to grant personal jurisdiction in that state. In particular, the court held that Patterson's use of storage, electronic transmission of files, and advertisement through CompuServe's network in Ohio were sufficient to grant Ohio personal jurisdiction over Patterson. Background Richard Patterson, a resident of Texas, subscribed to CompuServe, Inc., an Internet service provider with its headquarters in Ohio. Under the business moniker FlashPoint Development, Patterson developed a software product designed to help people navigate around the Internet. In 1991, from Texas, Patterson entered into an agreement with CompuServe in which Patterson could store, transmit, and advertise shareware files through CompuServe. Other CompuServe subscribers could purchase Patterson's software through CompuServe, and CompuServe would collect a 15% fee and pay Patterson the remaining balance. In 1993, CompuServe started marketing a software product similar to that of Patterson's with similar markings and names. In December 1993, Patterson informed CompuServe that he believed CompuServe's marketing of their product infringed his common law trademarks. While CompuServe changed its program's name, Patterson continued to complain. When Patterson demanded $100,000 to settle his claim, CompuServe filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory judgment in Ohio District Court. Legal proceedings Trial court proceedings Patterson responded to CompuServe's suit with a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Ohio court lacked personal jurisdiction. He supported this claim with an affidavit, stating that he had never visited Ohio, along with other facts that weighed against granting personal jurisdiction. CompuServe filed a memorandum in opposition along with supporting exhibits. Based on these filings, the District Court granted Patterson's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, in what Judge Bailey would later deem \\"a thorough and thoughtful opinion.\\" The trial court felt that the connection between Patterson in Texas and CompuServe in Ohio was \\"too tenuous to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\\" CompuServe appealed. Appellate court proceedings Patterson filed no brief on appeal and did not appear at oral argument for the appellate hearing. The court noted that individually, Patterson's sale of software in Ohio and entering into a contract with an Ohio company would be questionable grounds for exercising personal jurisdiction. The court then considered whether Ohio had the right to exercise jurisdiction under Ohio's long-arm statute, which uses a three-pronged test to determine if it is reasonable to exercise personal jurisdiction: # The defendant must have purposefully availed himself of the privilege of acting in the state # The legal action must have arisen from defendant's activities there # The acts of the defendant or consequences of his actions must have a sufficiently substantial connection to the state The court ruled that all three prongs were satisfied, since Patterson had contracted with CompuServe and repeatedly sent his computer software to CompuServe in Ohio and advertised through CompuServe's network. As such, they reversed the district court's dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. Impact The applicability of jurisdiction in cases involving activities over the Internet is interesting because an out-of-state resident can very easily cause an impact in the state in question, leading to questions of how large the impact need be before exercising jurisdiction is constitutional.Tyler, David D. Personal Jurisdiction via E-Mail: Has Personal Jurisdiction Changed in the Wake of CompuServe, Inc. v. Patterson? 51 Ark. L.

Cast Prior to the start of the season, a large number of cast changes occurred. Longtime cast members Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis all departed the show. In addition, featured player Tim Robinson left the cast to focus on his new duties in the writing staff, becoming the first performer to join the writing staff after being a cast member without initially being hired as a writer. Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong were all promoted to repertory status. The show hired six new featured players, including SNL writer Mike O'Brien who was upgraded into the cast, as well as new hires Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney of the sketch comedy group Good Neighbor, John Milhiser of the sketch group Serious Lunch, comedian No√´l Wells (known for her viral videos and impressions featured on sites such as Cracked.com), and stand-up comedian Brooks Wheelan. Mooney auditioned for the show in 2012 for the previous season. O'Brien had written for the show since 2009 and was the first writer to be upgraded into the cast since Jason Sudeikis in 2005. Bennett and Mooney's fellow Good Neighbor troupe member Dave McCary was also hired to direct Bennett and Mooney's digital shorts. On May 12, 2013, NBC announced that Weekend Update anchor Seth Meyers would be the new host of Late Night in 2014 succeeding Jimmy Fallon as Fallon was taking over as the new host of The Tonight Show. Meyers remained Weekend Update anchor up until his departure from the show on February 1, 2014. Cecily Strong was brought up to co-anchor with Meyers. Colin Jost, a writer for the show (and head writer for season 38 and 39), joined the cast on March 1, 2014, as a featured player and as Meyers' successor on Weekend Update. This is the third time a featured player was also a Weekend Update anchor. The first two were Tina Fey and Brian Doyle-Murray. Strong was replaced the next year by former writer and Daily Show correspondent Michael Che. During the season, the show came under criticism from critics (as well as cast members Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah) for not including at least one black female cast member, a topic that was addressed on the November 2, 2013, show hosted by Kerry Washington. As a result, Lorne Michaels announced that the show would be holding auditions for a black female cast member, expected to join the show in January as a new featured player. On January 6, 2014, it was announced that UCB-NY performer Sasheer Zamata would be joining the cast as a new featured player. She made her first appearance on January 18, 2014. The addition of eight new cast members is the greatest since the 1995‚Äì96 season, during which nine cast members were added, making it the largest cast overhaul in eighteen years. The total of 17 cast members was an SNL record, and some critics argued that the large cast contributed to how uneven the season was overall. This would be the final season for Nasim Pedrad, who had been a cast member since 2009. She announced her departure from the show in June 2014 in order to work on the Lorne Michaels-produced show, Mulaney. Additionally, John Milhiser, No√´l Wells, and Brooks Wheelan were fired from the show after one season. Also, Mike O'Brien left to return to the writer's room. This would also be the final season for longtime announcer Don Pardo, who died on August 18, 2014, at the age of 96. He had been the announcer for the show since its inception in 1975, missing only the 1981-82 season.

Prior to the start of the season, three new writers were hired: *Claire Mulaney, younger sister of former writer John Mulaney *Mikey Day, a member of The Groundlings and cast member on MTV's Wild 'N Out *Michael Che, a standup comic who had guest written for five episodes in season 38, was hired as a full-time writer. Additionally, Tim Robinson was moved to the writing staff after one year as a featured player on the show. In December, Chicago Second City alum Katie Rich joined the writing staff. In January, comedians LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones were added to the writing staff. Both were part of the December casting call for a black female cast member. This was Seth Meyers' final season as writer. Michael Che initially departed following this season to join The Daily Show as a correspondent, but returned for the start of the next season to co- anchor Weekend Update alongside Jost. This was also the final season for longtime writers Alex Baze (Weekend Update writer since 2004, and head of the segment since 2011), Marika Sawyer and John Solomon (both of whom had been with the show since 2006), as well as the only season for LaKendra Tookes.

Life Johanna Braach was a policewoman when she joined the NSDAP (membership number. 3.926.001) in early March 1937. From 1934 to 1941, she was deployed in the female police in Berlin. She then worked in the \\"Reich Central Office for combating juvenile delinquency\\" under Friederike Wieking. Wieking was a female detective in the Third Reich, and head of section V A 3 of the Reich Criminal Police Office in the Reich Security main office, as well as the Reich Central Office for combating the juvenile delinquency and truancy. Together with Lotte Toberentz, Braach visited several camps in 1941. Braach served as Deputy Head of the Uckermark girls camp from mid-1942 until its dissolution in April 1945. Lotte Toberentz was her supervisor during this period. About 1,000 girls and young women were interned in Uckermark by early 1945 . In 1947, Braach headed the female police force in the Minden district. Female police in Nazi Germany The build-up phase of the WKP fell in the period of national socialism. After 1935, the Prussian Landeskriminalamt had been converted into the Reich Criminal Police Bureau (RKPA). In 1937 the Nazis ordered the formation of a female police force, and further expanded it. Each major Department of the judicial police was attached to a WKP Department. Their work was organized according to National Socialist political principles. Wieking, in June 1934 was a member of the National Socialist Women's organization or NS-Frauenschaft. She was also a member of the National Socialist Association of civil servants, where she led the activities of the WKP crime Director of Department I of the RKPA. On July 1, 1939 the WKP was attached to the \\"Reich Central Office for combating the juvenile delinquency\\". Since 1941 it had responsibility for the protection of youth camp of Moringen, and in May 1942 it was responsible for the Uckermark girls camp, near the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in F√ºrstenberg/Havel. Wieking was imprisoned in 1945 for seven years by the Soviets. During the war, however, the female police demonstrably participated in the so-called \\"deployment of Jewish transports\\" (der sogenannten bereitstellung von Juden transporten), as well as the establishment of National Socialist Youth Hostels in the occupied regions, for example in Poland and Latvia. Office V (crime - Kripo) led by Chief SS- Brigadef√ºhrer and Major General of police Arthur Nebe. From August 15, 1944, after Nebe was executed, it was led by SS - Oberf√ºhrer and Oberregierungsrat Friedrich Panzinger; Friederike Wieking was the forensic Director of group V A 3 (female police). Trial in the West In the Third Ravensbruck Trial, also called the Uckermark process,(14th to 16 April 1948), Braach and Toberentz were indicted of being part of the SS female guardians, also called Wardresses (Aufseherinnen, SS-Gefolge) under British military penal code in the Hamburg Curiohaus, together with three other female relatives. The accused was charged with the following: # Abuse of female Allied prisoners in the period from May 1942 to April 1945 at the girls camp Uckermark # Participation in selection of female Allied prisoners for the gas chamber in the period from May 1942 to April 1945 at the girls camp Uckermark # Abuse of female Allied prisoners in the period from 1944 to April 1945 in the concentration camp at Ravensbr√ºck # Participation in selection of female Allied prisoners for the gas chamber in the period from May 1942 to April 1945 in the concentration camp of Ravensbr√ºck Braach's indictment included one to four points. For lack of evidence, she was acquitted, as was Toberentz, on April 26, 1948. The indictment included only crimes against Allied nationals, and since only German non-conformist girls and young women were under the girls camp, this was not the subject of the process. After the trial, Braach worked again in a managerial capacity at the West German police. Nothing is known further about her life.

Plot  Ted and the Mother are going out to dinner on their first date at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, three days after Barney and Robin's wedding. When they decide not to go to the restaurant they originally chose, the Mother says they should just find a restaurant where they don't need a reservation. Ted tells her that going somewhere without a reservation isn't easy, through the story of Gary Blauman. In the present, Blauman shows up a couple hours before the wedding begins and congratulates Robin. Robin pretends to be happy, but freaks out when she realizes that she didn't plan a seat for him. Marshall calms her down, telling her he will take care of it, as he is very good with wedding seating. However, Marshall realizes that it will be difficult to change the seating plan and recruits Ted to help so to avoid screwing up. Ted refuses because he hated Blauman ever since they competed for a girl once at a party. Lily comes in, saying she is grateful to Blauman after he stopped her from getting a huge tattoo on her back following her and Marshall's breakup. The Mother stops Ted momentarily after spotting her ex-boyfriend in the distance. She tells Ted she recently had a bad breakup and isn't ready to date, but wants him to finish his story. In the present, the three go to Barney for the tie-breaking vote. Barney doesn't want him there either, as Blauman once stole four of Barney's fries at MacLaren's, including the accidental curly. Billy Zabka and James come in; Zabka wants him there, because Blauman appreciates his poetry, but James doesn't, as his affair with Blauman caused him to divorce his husband, Tom. Ted changes his mind about Blauman from this disclosure, realising that Blauman was actually competing with the girl for Ted's attention. Marshall ultimately makes the tie-breaking vote: Blauman stays because Robin wants him to, as she is the bride and has final say over any decision. Barney then admits he already told Blauman to leave, forcing the gang to go after him. The Mother cuts off the story again when they reach her apartment building. After exchanging goodbyes, Ted walks away as Future Ted says he didn't make the mistake he made eight years earlier during his first date with Robin, when he prematurely told her that he loves her. Much to Ted's relief, the Mother calls him back and asks him to finish the story. In the present, the gang finds Blauman as he is about to drive away, leading Ted to realize that he must hold on to the people that matter most to him, as they could instantly disappear from his life. Future Ted then reveals the fates of many acquaintances he and his friends had met in his stories: * Carl continues to run MacLaren's, with the bar becoming a family business after he has a son. * Jeanette is arrested for her obsessive behavior and ends up getting together with her therapist, Robin's ex-boyfriend Kevin. The two now live in Poughkeepsie. *Ranjit ends up getting rich off the stock market, and buys the limo company where he's worked for years. * Patrice gets her own drive-time radio show, and regularly listens to and offers advice to her listeners, one of whom is Robin. * Billy Zabka is honored with the American Humanities Medal for Literature for his poetry, becoming the youngest winner of the award. * Zoey continues her environmentalism, supporting many causes (some questionable, as shown when she is attacked by a hawk she's trying to save). * Scooter marries Jasmine the stripper, obviously due to her resemblance to Lily. * Blitz fights and beats a gambling addiction following a three-day bender at a slot machine, which paid off immediately after he left it. * Ted remains uncertain as to what happened to Blah Blah, but does manage to remember that her name is Carol. * Sandy Rivers' inappropriate behavior destroys his career in the U.S., but he soon finds work anchoring a Russian news program and never changes. * James manages to convince his husband Tom to take him back, and the two enjoy a very happy life together with their son and daughter. The narration concludes with the return of Blauman, saying he doesn't want to miss the wedding. After finishing his story, Ted and the Mother have their first kiss, and decide to walk around the city some more. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology praised the episode, saying HIMYM \\"very effectively used the character [Gary Blauman] as an instrument to not only show us another slice of Ted and The Mother's life together, but it also used Blauman as a device to assure fans that there were happy endings in the future for many of our favorite characters.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 8.7/10, saying that it \\"delivered a sharp and enjoyable storyline that felt like a snapshot of the show's former glory.\\" References External links * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 9) episodes ","title":"Gary Blauman"},{"id":"37935272","text":"Minjur railway station is one of the railway stations of the Chennai Central‚ÄìGummidipoondi section of the Chennai Suburban Railway Network.

It follows a poor man named Karman who becomes a member of the Indonesian Communist Party, only to find himself a victim of the ongoing political struggles in 1950s Indonesia. After the Party's destruction he spends twelve years as a prisoner at Buru before returning to his hometown and becoming a devout Muslim. Tohari's second novel, Kubah was written in two months and based on the events surrounding the Communist Party and the 30 September Movement coup in 1965. Published in 1980 by Pustaka Jaya, Kubah came at a time when literary works with similar themes ‚Äì the victimisation of Communist Party members ‚Äì were scarce. The novel has also been characterised as dawah (Islamic preaching). Reception of Kubah was mostly mixed; critics praised the novel for its subject matter and criticised it for its predictability. It received a literary award in 1981, and in 1986 it was translated into Japanese. Plot After twelve years imprisoned at Buru Island, the former Communist Party of Indonesia (, or PKI) member Karman returns to Central Java. During his time at Buru, his wife Marni has remarried and the area has modernised considerably, rendering him uncertain where to go. He decides to stay at his cousin's home for a while. Meanwhile, Marni has heard of Karman's release and realises that she still loves him, and would thus feel uncomfortable if he returned to their hometown of Pegaten. However, their grown daughter Tini wishes to meet her father. In a series of flashbacks, Karman's life is told. He lost his pro-Dutch father during the Indonesian National Revolution and was raised in poverty before going to work for the rich merchant Haji Bakir as a child, babysitting his daughter Rifah. In the two years Karman lived with them, the family raised him to be a devout Muslim; Karman, for his part, was a diligent worker and cared deeply for Rifah. When his uncle returned from the front, Karman was brought back home and educated until junior high school, dropping out for a lack of funds. When he was in his twenties Karman found a job at the local village chief's office with the help of a civil employee named Triman and a teacher named Margo. Unknown to Karman, both men were PKI members and intent on making him join the party. They gave him communist pamphlets and indoctrinated him in Party philosophy. When Karman was late in telling Rifah his feelings, losing her to another man, the PKI manipulated his emotions to make him leave Islam and hate Haji Bakir. Ultimately this was successful: Karman abandoned his mandatory prayers and began to espouse the Party's politics. After Karman was refused marriage to Rifah a second time, following her husband's death, he had Haji Bakir imprisoned. In this time Karman married Marni, intending to convert her family to communism. By 1965 Karman had become a respected member of the PKI, although the public knew him as a member of Partindo. However, following the failure of the 30 September Movement (, or G30S) coup in the national capital at Jakarta ‚Äì orchestrated by the PKI ‚Äì Karman realised that his position was unsound. He and his fellow PKI members began praying regularly, but many were ultimately killed ‚Äì including Triman and Margo. Karman escaped from Pegaten hours before soldiers came to arrest him and managed to avoid capture for nearly two months, generally hiding in cemeteries. After his capture Karman was exiled to Buru. In the present day, Karman has returned to Pegaten to a warm reception. Marni, although she admits that she still loves Karman, insists that she will stay with her new husband; Haji Bakir, Karman's uncle, and Karman's mother have likewise forgiven him. Tini and Haji Bakir's grandson Jabir are betrothed as planned, and, when the villagers renovate the dilapidated mosque, Karman makes the cupola. He receives much praise for his work and finds a sense of belonging in the mosque. Background and writing Kubah was inspired by Indonesian history, beginning in the 1940s and continuing until the 1980s. Following the national revolution from 1945 to 1949, the country was set in a state of political turmoil and abject poverty which became increasingly severe towards the end of the 1950s. By the early 1960s the PKI and other leftist parties had the support of President Sukarno, giving them greater power; PKI membership grew quickly in this period, aided by a hyperinflation and widespread poverty. On 1 October 1965, a group of Indonesian National Armed Forces members calling themselves the 30 September Movement killed six Army generals and announced that the president was under their power; the coup was quashed the following day. Contemporary reports indicated that the PKI had been behind the G30S, a position endorsed by the Indonesian government. As a result, hundreds of thousands of registered and suspected PKI members were killed or exiled over the following decade, effectively destroying the Party. By 1974 Buru held some 10,000 prisoners, while others were held elsewhere or forced to stay abroad. Political prisoners began to be released by the 1970s, but saw systematic discrimination at all levels of society: they found themselves under surveillance and with little hope of employment. Kubah was the second novel written by Ahmad Tohari, who had been in senior high school when the G30S announced its coup. A devout Muslim who had trained as a doctor and ran a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Central Java, Tohari began to focus on writing when his first novel, Di Kaki Bukit Cibalak (On the Foothill of Cibalak; 1978), won a prize from the Jakarta Arts Council. He finished Kubah in two months, first making a thematic overview for each chapter and then developing it further while writing. He deliberately left the novel's ending open to interpretation, intending for readers to think for themselves. Themes Kubah is an early example of literature dealing with the G30S and PKI, although earlier examples exist. Former Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid described it as the first to deal with reconciliation between PKI members and general Indonesian society after G30S, an issue which was \\"hyper-sensitive\\" at the time. The historian Anna-Greta Nilsson Hoadley writes that Kubah explored why a person would be motivated to join the party, emphasizing poverty, cultural pressure, and active propaganda by the PKI. In the end, Karman is ultimately an \\"innocent victim\\", who only joined the Party to improve his own standing. Even after his release Karman remains in a state of fear, \\"marked by a prisoner's vulnerability.\\" The literary critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian wrote that, in this sense, Karman becomes representative of all PKI members who were arrested following G30S. Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as undergoing an existential quest to establish his identity, seemingly finding an answer in the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions. Release and reception Kubah was originally published by the Jakarta-based Pustaka Jaya in 1980; unlike Di Kaki Bukit Cibalak and most of Tohari's later novels, it had not been serialised first. Since 1995 it has been published by Gramedia, seeing four printings . The work was translated into Japanese by Shinobu Yamane in 1986, under the title Shinsei. The novel's reception was mixed. It was awarded the Buku Utama Prize in 1981 for \\"increasing knowledge, spreading manners, and maturing Indonesian culture,\\" an award which included a trophy and Rp. 1 million in prize money. Mahayana found it worthy of this prize, praising Kubah use of flashback and the complicated issues it raised. Wahid, at the time an active Islamic intellectual with the Nahdlatul Ulama, wrote in 1980 that Kubah had poorly realised its potential; he characterised it as a beginner's work: lacking suspense, overly moralistic, and predictable. Tohari's trilogy Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk (The Dancer of Paruk Village; 1981‚Äì1985), which has proven to be his most famous, also dealt with the G30S and the PKI. However, unlike Kubah, parts of Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk remained censored until 2003. Numerous novels dealing with G30S and the PKI, written by other authors, have also been published since Kubah.

He is known for establishing hospitals in Quetta and North Sind and is credited with saving the sight of more than 100,000 people. Early life and education Henry Holland was born on 12 February 1875 to Canon L. W. Holland, a parish priest, in Durham, England. He lived on the banks of the Tweed River, and at the age of five, traveled around with his father. Some of his hobbies were fishing, riding, and hunting. In terms of schooling, he was tutored by his father and aunts until he was 11 and later went to Durham School and Loretto School. Medical studies Holland enrolled in the University of Edinburgh in 1894 to become a missionary doctor, graduating in 1899 with distinctions. Then, he began visiting many educational institutions as part his position as the Traveling Secretary of the Student Volunteer Mission and also became part of the Church Missionary Society. In his last four months of his position as Traveling Secretary, he left for Quetta to replace a doctor on leave. In Quetta and North Sind  Quetta  The hospital in Quetta was a medical mission established in 1886 by British officials, mainly to treat the illnesses of tribesmen in the region. Many different tribes came to the hospital, including the Brahuis, Pathnans, Pushtus, Baluchis, Sindhis, and Punjabis. The hospital treated many different ailments including common illnesses of dysentery and malaria and surgeries for hemorrhoids, tubercular glands, and cataracts. Having no previous hands-on experience in a hospital, Holland worked many hours alongside doctors to learn about administering treatments and performing surgery. He continued his learning by visiting hospitals in Kashmir, Punjab, and Sind and went on to take and pass medical exams in many languages including Urdu, Persian, and Pushtu. Trying to take a searcher approach, Holland went into the countryside to talk to tribespeople about their lives and their medical needs. Many mentioned cataracts and eye infections, which was not surprising due to the conditions of the area with its heat, dust, winds, flies, and unsafe water. The prevalence of cataracts and eye infections lead Holland to develop sympathy for the blind, find interest in eye care, and soon, specialize in ophthalmic surgery. For his ophthalmologic work, he became in charge of this hospital in Quetta in 1907. From there, the hospital grew steadily due to increases in the need for ophthalmologic treatment. It began building wards so that patients could be accompanied by relatives, which was especially important for patients who traveled from afar, added extra beds, and bought an X-ray unit. By 1930, 14 wards were built for patients. In addition to physical size, the hospital also grew in the professional context. It developed a training program for male nurses in 1926 and for dispensers in 1931. In May 1935, however, an earthquake hit Quetta and destroyed the hospital. He returned to England to raise money for the Rebuilding Fund for the hospital. In the meantime, temporary structures were used. The reconstruction of the hospital began in 1936 and was finally completed on 6 May 1940.  North Sind In 1909, a wealthy Hindu philanthropist invited Holland to treat patients in Shikarpur, in North Sind. Holland agreed to treat the patients for free if the philanthropist would use the money to build a hospital. In only one year, this hospital grew to be one of the largest eye clinics in the world, treating up to 600 patients at a time. The success of this hospital became widespread. Soon, eye specialists all around the world from India to the United States came to the hospital to learn more through both observation and working. With the additional help, about 3,000 operations (1,400 for cataracts) were performed at the hospital during the two months it was open for each year. It was recorded that just Holland himself performed up to 70 cataract operations a day. Since the Shikarpur hospital's establishment, over 150,000 eye operations have been performed, including 77, 600 successful cataract extractions. Another clinic was later established in the nearby city of Khairpur, which was also in North Sind. Contribution to ophthalmology In addition to the establishment of many successful hospital, Holland contributed to ophthalmology in his research and development of surgical procedures. For example, Holland discovered that iridectomy and iridotomy were more effective than drainage procedures in the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. He also found that an iridectomy could help with the high intraocular pressures of a cataract patient and defer cataract surgery. Moreover, Holland's specific iridectomy and iridotomy methods were able to remove the danger of the iris prolapsing and, thus, simplify and improve postoperative treatment. This included allowing movement after surgery and being able to eat a normal diet as opposed to a liquid diet, both of which contributed to the patient's wellbeing in the recovery process. Holland's successful methods were very precisely documented by Dr. Anderson Hilding, who had visited the Shikarpur hospital to learn through observation and experience. Excerpt: Henry Holland and his son, Ronald Holland, also performed various methods of intracapsular cataract extraction and provides commentary on under what circumstances the \\"Smith method\\" should be used and how it should be done. Excerpt: Later years Holland retired in March 1948. In 1958, he published an autobiographical work titled Frontier Doctor.Frontier doctor : An autobiography by Henry Holland Personal life In 1906, a nurse, Effie Tunbridge, began working the hospital at Quetta. Holland married her four years later. They had two sons, Harry and Ronald, and a daughter, Esme. Ronald would later join his father and play a key role in his work on the Quetta frontier. Together, they would perform on as many as 200 to 300 outpatients a day, totaling to more than 150,000 eye operations through the Shikarpur clinic.

This species lives among floating seaweed in the world's oceans, feeding on hydroids. Description Scyllaea pelagica is a sturdy nudibranch that grows to a length of about . It is dorso-ventrally flattened. At the anterior end there are two pairs of sensory tentacles and a pair of rhinophores enclosed in large rhinophore sheaths. On the sides of the body are two pairs of irregular lobes with toothed edges and squared ends known as cerata. The inner surfaces of these bear numerous small gills. At the posterior end of the body there is a flattened dorsal crest. The skin is smooth except for a few conical tubercles. The colour is a dull yellowish-brown or greenish-brown with some small white markings. Sometimes there is a row of tiny bright blue spots along each side. Distribution Scyllaea pelagica occurs globally in pantropical oceans among floating masses of weed. It is especially common in the Caribbean area and Gulf of Mexico and it often gets washed up onto the beach with seaweed after storms. Biology Scyllaea pelagica is nearly always a pelagic species but is occasionally found on brown seaweed anchored to the seabed. It spends its life among sargasso weed (Sargassum spp.) floating in tropical seas where it is well camouflaged. It feeds by grazing on the hydroids that grow on the weed and if it gets detached from the fronds can swim to a limited extent by flexing its body. Scyllaea pelagica is a hermaphrodite. Two individuals come together to exchange sperm through their genital openings and fertilisation is internal. The eggs are laid in a jelly coated mass on the weed and the trochophore larvae are planktonic. Studies using radioactive carbon labelling have shown that in nutrient-poor waters such as the Sargasso Sea, the larvae of Scyllaea pelagica can directly incorporate into their epidermis and cerata, amino acids that have been added to the water.

Ancestry Most medieval pedigrees identify Edwin's father as Gronwy, a descendant of Hywel Dda. He may have been a great-great-grandson of Hywel Dda although this is disputed. From his name, it is clear he had Anglo-Saxon ancestry, and his mother is believed to have been Ethelfleda or Aldgyth, daughter of Eadwine of Mercia. 220px Lordship of Tegeingl Edwin is known to have been Lord or Prince of the cantref of Tegeingl. The cantref formed the eastern part of Perfeddwlad (or Y Berfeddwlad) on the northern coast of Wales between the River Clwyd and Deeside. The territory, originally forming part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, had been under the control of the Anglo-Saxons for several centuries and then changed hands several times between the two. Biography Edwin was probably born between 1017 and 1020. He is believed to have resided at Trefedwen near Rhuddlan. Although Edwin is sometimes called King of Tegeingl in the medieval pedigrees there is no reference to him in the chronicles of Wales; there are, however, references to his sons. He appears to have been raised to the lordship of Tegeingl by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, ruler of most of Wales between 1055 and 1064. Edwin married Iwerydd (or Gwerydd), sister of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, Prince of Gwynedd and Powys. Descendants Edwin had three sons, Owain, Uchdryd, and Hywel. Many aristocratic North Wales families (particularly in Flintshire and Denbighshire) claimed descent from Edwin including the Mostyns of Mostyn and of Talacre.

Sir Eyre Coote was his younger brother. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Dublin.thepeerage.com Charles Henry Coote, 2nd Baron Castle Coote Political career Coote was returned to the Irish House of Commons for Queen's County in 1776, a seat he held until 1783, and then represented Maryborough until 1798. He once again sat for Queen's County from 1798 to 1800, when the Irish Parliament was abolished. He served as Commissioner of Barracks of Ireland between 1788 and 1789, as Commissioner of Accounts of Ireland between 1789 and 1795, as Commissioner of Customs of Ireland between 1795 and 1799 and as Commissioner of Excise of Ireland between 1799 and 1806 and was sworn of the Irish Privy Council in 1800.

In 1800 Coote's kinsman Charles Coote, 7th Earl of Mountrath, had been created Baron Castle Coote, in the Queen's County, in the Peerage of Ireland, with a special remainder to his kinsman, Charles Coote. Lord Mountrath died in 1802 and Charles Coote succeeded as 2nd Baron Castle Coote according to the special remainder (the earldom became extinct; see Coote baronets). Coote was consequently forced to resign his seat in Parliament as Irish peers were not allowed to represent Irish constituencies in Parliament.

It was the worst disaster in the history of American sports spectating. National League Park National League Park (also known as Baker Bowl), was built in 1895 using novel construction techniques, prominently featuring a cantilever design to support the roof and upper decks. The modernized building also heavily utilized fire resistant materials like steel and brick, in order to avoid destructive fires like the one that had ravaged the Phillies' previous stadium, the mainly wood- constructed Philadelphia Base Ball Park, in 1894. The disaster On August 8, 1903, during a double-header between the Phillies and the Braves, two drunken men walking along 15th street adjacent to the park were being teased by a group of children. One of the men allegedly grabbed by the hair a thirteen-year-old girl named Maggie Barry from the group of children, and after a brief struggle, fell on top of her. Accounts of the incident say that cries for help from the girl and her friends drew attention from spectators in the stadium above, and approximately 300 people crowded the balcony above the street to get a view of the commotion. Under the weight of the curious onlookers, the overloaded balcony's supports apparently became detached from their connections at the wall, and plunged approximately to the street below.

He sang in opera, cabaret and musicals. He is perhaps best known for his 1963 recorded collaboration with Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne, conducted by Richard Bonynge, known as The Age of Bel Canto. Biography Born in Astoria, Queens, Richard Conrad studied in Boston with Harry Euler Treiber, in Germany with Gisela Rohmert, and had other studies under Felix Wolfes, Aksel Schi√∏tz and Pierre Bernac. In his early years Conrad was a light baritone. He soon developed the ability to pass easily into the \\"head\\" register as well as the technical facility to manage the most intricate florid passages. Treiber and others began to recommend that he might emulate the \\"baritones\\" of the 18th and early 19th centuries, many of whom sang as tenors, and He began exploring the bel canto and unusual coloratura tenor repertoire. His operatic debut was in Boston in 1961 singing in the American premiere of Mozart's La finta semplice, and later that year he made his recital debut in Washington, DC. In 1963 he was brought to the attention of Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, with whom he made a series of historic recordings of the florid bel canto repertoire. In 1966 he settled in Rome, Italy and performed in opera, with orchestra, in recital, and on radio and television in many countries of Europe, England, the United States, Canada, and Africa. He returned to Boston in 1980 and founded the Boston Academy of Music (a reincarnation of a previously defunct organization of the same name). He managed the concert and opera repertory company for 23 years, presenting the American premiere of Sir Arthur Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe and many operas which had never been heard in Boston Richard Strauss's Arabella, the original version of Verdi's La forza del destino, Rossini's La pietra del paragone, and many others). Subsequently he founded and led The Bostonian Opera and Concert Ensemble (\\"The Bostonians\\") with which he produced (and sang the role of Golaud) the New England premiere of the original version of Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande, which was recorded by ARSIS AUDIO. In 1983 he was the victim of a street mugging in which his voice was severely injured. After a long period of rehabilitation and retraining (under Gisela Rohmert at the Lichtenberger Institut in Germany), he reemerged (again as a baritone), specializing in the comic roles of Gilbert and Sullivan and the Italian bel canto composers. In 1985 he began touring in revues of music by Cole Porter, Jacques Brel, Jerome Kern, Kurt Weill and No√´l Coward. He made his theater debut in the premiere of Janet Hood and Bill Russell's Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens (New York 1990), and sang in the premiere of Move! at the Carre Theater in Amsterdam the following year. He has also enjoyed a success as Albin in La Cage aux Folles and as Cervantes/Don Quixote in Man of La Mancha. Additional singing premieres include the American premiere of Haydn's Orfeo ed Euridice (1966), and the world premiere of Niccol√≤ Castiglioni's I tre misteri (1968). As a producer, he sang and directed the American premiere of the two-act version of Donizetti's Maria Stuarda, and in 2003 he created the role of Montressor in Daniel Pinkham's The Cask of Amontillado. For many years he was based in Boston, where his activities included teaching and mentoring, production, and stage direction, in addition to singing. For his 70th birthday in 2005, he presented a recital of arias and songs at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The composers included No√´l Coward, Arthur Sullivan, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Daniel Pinkham, Janet Hood and Henry Bishop. In 2011 he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his debut with over 40 colleagues at MIT's Kresge Auditorium. Richard Conrad died on August 26, 2019.

Biography He was born the second son of Charles Ludovic Honywood of Charing, Kent. He entered the Army as an ensign in James Stanley's regiment of foot on 12 June 1694,Charles Dalton (1898), English Army Lists and Commission Registers 1661‚Äì1714, volume IV, p. 29-30 and served under King William III in the Netherlands. He was promoted to captain in the Royal Fusiliers on 1 April 1696, and captain in the Earl of Huntingdon's newly raised regiment on 10 March 1702. In the reign of Queen Anne he shared in the toils and dangers of two campaigns in Brabant under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and afterward transferred his services to Spain. He was rewarded for his excellent conduct with the lieutenant-colonelcy of the regiment, now Wade's (and later the 33rd). On 27 May 1709 he was promoted to the colonelcy of the 92nd Regiment, which was disbanded in 1712,Cannon (1837), Historical Record of the First, or King's Regiment of Dragoon Guards, p. 115-116. and in 1710 he obtained the rank of brigadier- general. He was a zealous and warm-hearted advocate for the Protestant succession, and on the formation of a new ministry which was believed to be favourable to the interests of the Pretender, Honywood, Lieutenant-General Meredith and Major-General Macartney were guilty of drinking at a public dinner in Flanders the toast of \\"Damnation and confusion to the new Ministry, and to those who had any hand in turning out the old\\", and they received an official intimation that the Queen had no further occasion for their services. Four years afterwards a change of monarch took place: the ministers who had induced the Queen to deprive him of his commission were charged with high treason and fled to France, and Brigadier-General Honywood was rewarded for his attachment to the House of Hanover with the post of Groom of the Bedchamber in the household of the new King George I. He also received a commission on 22 July 1715 to raise, form and discipline a corps of cavalry, later the 11th Hussars. He served at the head of his regiment during the rebellion of the Earl of Mar, commanded a brigade at Preston, and was wounded at the storming of one of the avenues of the town, on which occasion he evinced signal valour and judgement.Cannon (1843), Historical Record of the Eleventh, or the Prince Albert's Own Regiment of Hussars, p. 95-97 In 1719 Honywood commanded a brigade in the expedition against Spain, under Lieutenant-General Lord Cobham. He took possession of the town of Vigo with eight hundred men, and was afterwards engaged in the siege of the citadel, which surrendered in a few days. He was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1726, and in 1727 he was placed on the staff of the army held in readiness to embark for Holland. On 29 May 1732, after commanding the 11th Dragoons seventeen years, he was removed to the 3rd Dragoons,Cannon (1847), Historical Record of the Third, or the King's Own Regiment of Light Dragoons, p. 114 and in 1735 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In 1742 a British force was sent to Flanders under Honywood, who held the chief command of the troops until the arrival of the Earl of Stair. In the following year he was promoted to the rank of general, and on 18 April 1743 he was appointed colonel of the King's Horse, later 1st Dragoon Guards. At the battle of Dettingen one division of the army was commanded by Honywood, and he led the Royal Horse Guards and the King's Horse to the charge with great gallantry. He served in the subsequent campaigns on the Continent with distinction, and with the approbation of his Sovereign, by whom he was advanced to the dignity of Knight of the Order of the Bath. He died in 1752, and was interred with military honours at Portsmouth, of which place he was Governor at the time of his decease. References External links A. A.

In most of FRUCT projects undergraduates and PhD students are the main developers, who solve problems with help and supervision of academia and industrial experts. The set of activities is targeted to create the complete innovation cycle for competence and business development. The cycle starts by identification of the most promising research topics based on public information about long-term research vision and priorities of industrial leaders. Depending on the problem scale and long-team importance of the topic, FRUCT creates working group or project team to address it. Each group and project team is formed as a distributed R&D; consortium with clear definition of member roles. The teams solve scientific and technological tasks based on own vision and industrial requests. Administratively project team members belong to regional FRUCT laboratories. FRUCT laboratories are organized at regional FRUCT universities. Most of the laboratory members are official employees of universities, which most of time working for FRUCT projects. After the required level of competences is gained the team either organizes innovation startup or start large research project by using regional and cross-border grants.  Support of research  Open training on Smart-M3, at the 8th FRUCT conference in Lappeenranta Ideas of FRUCT projects can be originated by university professors and industrial experts. In this case the project initiator takes obligation to be the project supervisor. Also undergraduate and PhD students can propose topics of new projects. Student proposals are reviewed and commented by FRUCT advisory board. The preference is given to proposals that have large R&D; potential and project targeted in development of practical applications and innovative software-hardware solutions. For approved proposals FRUCT appoints supervisors and scientific advisors. Accepted FRUCT projects can apply for support to cover part of direct implementation expenses, e.g., traveling to conferences, books, purchases of hardware, etc. The best students are recommended to take part in various contests, grant and scholarship programs, etc. The project progress should be presented twice a year at FRUCT conferences. Project progress update consists of a report in form of conference paper, presentation and training or demo when applicable. As a result of each project at least one paper should be published in the proceedings of an international conference or journal. FRUCT conference has its own proceedings and the best papers from them are recommended for IEEE and journals publication. In addition, for papers accepted to publication in the recommended conferences, the main student author can apply for a grant to cover related travel expenses. Such travel grants are provided by FRUCT industrial members, e.g., Nokia Corporation.

In 1790, To·∫£n received the title An Nam qu·ªëc v∆∞∆°ng th·∫ø t·ª≠ (\\"Crown Prince of Annam\\") from China. The title indicated that his heirship was also recognized by China. Quang Trung died in 1792. On the deathbed, Quang Trung described Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n as \\"a clever boy but too young\\". To·∫£n ascended the throne and changed the era name to \\"C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh\\" () in the same year, when he was only nine years old. He granted his stepmother B√πi Th·ªã Nh·∫°n the title Empress dowager. B√πi ƒê·∫Øc Tuy√™n was granted the position th√°i s∆∞ (\\"Grand Preceptor\\"). B√πi ƒê·∫Øc Tuy√™n was favoured by the young emperor, and became the de facto ruler of the country. Tuy√™n banished one of important ministers, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn K·ª∑ (), from the capital Ph√∫ Xu√¢n (mordern Hu·∫ø). His behavior had aroused the anger of many ministers and generals. In 1793, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c was attacked by Nguy·ªÖn lord, asked for Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n's help. To·∫£n repulsed the attack, then annexed Nh·∫°c's territory. Nh·∫°c died soon after suffering from vomiting blood. Nh·∫°c's eldest son, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£o, was granted the title Hi·∫øu c√¥ng by To·∫£n. B√πi ƒê·∫Øc Tr·ª• () and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hu·∫•n () were left in Quy Nh∆°n to watch B·∫£o. T√¢y S∆°n launched a powerful offensive in 1794.

Several months later, Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T·ª© () were sent to attack Di√™n Kh√°nh again. However, a coup d'√©tat occurred in the next year, forcing Di·ªáu to withdraw. One night, Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n was in B√πi ƒê·∫Øc Tuy√™n's house. V≈© VƒÉn D≈©ng, Ph·∫°m C√¥ng H∆∞ng and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hu·∫•n, besieged house, forcing C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh to hand over Tuy√™n.

As a niece-in- law of Tuy√™n, general Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu was not trusted by the three generals. Di·ªáu quickly marched north and stayed at An C·ª±u. In the same time, an army under V≈© VƒÉn D≈©ng and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Danh () also marched there. A civil war might break out at any moment, which made the young emperor afraid. Finally, Di·ªáu was reconciled with the three generals.

The power struggle destabilized the regime, which provided Nguy·ªÖn lord an opportunity to launch an offensive attack in 1797. What was worse, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£o occupied Quy Nh∆°n and planned to surrender to Nguy·ªÖn lord. Fortunately, the rebellion was put down in 1798. However, many ministers were accused of getting involved in the incident, including L√™ Trung () and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hu·∫•n. They were arrested and executed. T√¢y S∆°n generals felt themselves imperilled, they were at odds with the emperor. In 1799, Quy Nh∆°n was besieged by Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh.

H·ªì C√¥ng Di·ªáu was chosen as scapegoat; he was arrested and transferred to Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu. In 1800, Tr·∫ßn Quang Di·ªáu and V≈© VƒÉn D≈©ng were sent south to besiege Quy Nh∆°n. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh led a large number of army to reinforce B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh. However, V√µ T√°nh, the governor of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh, suggested that he would pin the main T√¢y S∆°n force down there so that Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh could attack their capital Ph√∫ Xu√¢n. √Ånh agreed, and then he marched north. In this time, Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n had to deal with several internal rebellions. H√† C√¥ng Th√°i (), a Degar leader, revolted in Thanh H√≥a Province and pledged loyalty to Nguy·ªÖn lord; a Christian-inspired revolt broke out in Tonkin. To make matters worse, Vientiane and Muang Phuan attacked Ngh·ªá An Province, cooperating with Nguy·ªÖn forces. Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n had to ask Nguy·ªÖn Thi·∫øp for advice. Thi·∫øp said it was impossible to deal with current affairs; however, if the capital could be relocated in Ph∆∞·ª£ng Ho√†ng trung ƒë√¥ (, in present-day Vinh), the lifetime of the dynasty might be prolonged. To·∫£n vacillated for too long and the opportunity to accept was lost. In 1801, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's army reached T∆∞ Dung estuary (present-day T∆∞ Hi·ªÅn estuary), defeated Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Tr·ªã in Quy S∆°n Hill. A naval battle broke out in N·ªôn estuary (present-day Thu·∫≠n An estuary); both Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n and Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh directed the battle personally. Many Chinese pirates were hired by T√¢y S∆°n to fight against Nguy·ªÖn lord. In Nguy·ªÖn lord side, several Western adventurers joined the battle, including Jean- Baptiste Chaigneau, Philippe Vannier and Laurent Andr√© Barisy. Chaigneau described that it was the fiercest battle between T√¢y S∆°n dynasty and Nguy·ªÖn lord. The battle ended with a near annihilation of both T√¢y S∆°n navy and Chinese pirates. Three famous pirates, Mo Guanfu, Liang Wengeng (, L∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Canh) and Fan Wencai ( Ph√†n VƒÉn T√†i), were captured by Nguy·ªÖn lord. Nguy·ªÖn army soon occupied the capital Ph√∫ Xu√¢n. Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n fled to ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi, with a dozen men, then to ThƒÉng Long. In there, he was supported by his brother Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy. Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n changed the era name to \\"B·∫£o H∆∞ng\\" (). He made efforts to gain popularity among Northern Vietnamese. In foreign affairs, he sent an envoy to seek aid from the Jiaqing Emperor of Qing China. Meanwhile, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh also sent an envoy, extraditing Mo Guanfu, Liang Wengeng and Fan Wencai to China. Three pirates confessed that they were supported by T√¢y S∆°n dynasty. It proved that T√¢y S∆°n dynasty had shielded many Chinese pirates. Before this incident, Chinese government had captured two pirates Wang Guili (, V∆∞∆°ng Qu√Ω L·ª£i) and Fan Guangxi (, Ph·∫°m Quang H·ªâ); in their vessels, Chinese found two T√¢y S∆°n official seals. The irate Jiaqing rejected to help Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n, and deported his envoy.Draft History of Qing, vol. 527 In 1802, Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy was sent to attack L≈©y Th·∫ßy (in present-day Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province). Later, Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n led 30 thousand men marched to Linh River (modern Gianh River) to attack Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. Both of their army were utterly beaten. To·∫£n fled to Ngh·ªá An, in there he met Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy. They fled back to ThƒÉng Long together. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's army marched further north. In June, they captured ThƒÉng Long. Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n fled across the Nh·ªã River (present day Red River) along with Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy, Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy, Nguy·ªÖn Quang Thi·ªáu (), Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn D·ª•ng (), Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T·ª© and the Empress dowager B√πi Th·ªã Nh·∫°n. In Ph∆∞·ª£ng Nh√£n (L·∫°ng Giang), They were captured alive by local villagers. Nguy·ªÖn Quang Th√πy and B√πi Th·ªã Nh·∫°n committed suicide; the others were transferred to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, and executed by Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh.

Characteristics As the name implies, farm gate sales is a marketing strategy undertaken by the producer near the location where the product is produced. Consumers come to the production unit or farm to buy produce and, in some cases, pick the produce themselves. Examples include the sale of vegetables from a producer‚Äôs garden, the sale of eggs from an egg production unit, the direct sale of livestock from a ranch, and pick-your-own berries, fruits, and flowers operations. In general, there is no limit to the type of items that can be marketed in this manner as long as there are willing buyers and local ordinances permit such sales. Sometimes, a very limited number of intermediaries are situated between the farmer and the consumer (see also short food supply chains). Generally, wholesalers and retailers are by-passed, and revenue received from the sales contributes immediately to a farm‚Äôs income. In terms of social goals, farmgate sales helps to build a direct relationship between the farming community and consumers as well as fostering respect for food and awareness of how it is produced by consumers. It can also contribute to budget savings by consumers (see also potato movement). In environmental terms, farmgate sales shorten transport distances and are expected to reduce food waste. Sales methods Farmgate sales are most common in the form of either retail outlets on the farm itself in a farm shop, roadside farm stands, or in market stands run by farmers at farmers' markets or food fairs. However, other distribution channels are also used such as door-to-door sales and distance selling ‚Äì so- called ‚Äòbox schemes‚Äô ‚Äì where farmers take orders by telephone, mail order or via the internet. Also practised are ‚Äòpick-your-own‚Äô schemes where farmers invite consumers to pick their own fruit and vegetables. Challenges A main challenge for farmgate sales lies in ensuring compliance with food law (e.g. hygiene rules and labelling requirements)http://www.todmordennews.co.uk/news/local/farm-gate-sales-can- cut-red-tape-on-eggs-1-1847797; http://www.therockymountaingoat.com/2010/10/farm-sales-open-up/ as well as consumer law (information requirements and, at times, the consumer‚Äôs right to withdraw from a contract of sale). This complex regulatory environment can be difficult to handle for farmers not trained in these areas. Regulations Under the heading of ‚ÄúProduct of my farm‚Äù the European Commission has started to take an interest in promoting farmgate sales and is contemplating a policy which would encourage farmers to engage in direct marketing schemes for their produce. A specific labelling scheme is in development as the so-called ‚ÄúQuality Regulation‚Äù ‚Äì Art. 55 of Regulation (EU) No. 1151/2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:343:0001:0029:EN:PDF ‚Äì required a study on the benefits of a ‚Äòfarmgate label‚Äô to be completed until 2014. This study was presented on 6 December 2013 (Commission fosters debate on potential‚Äòlocal food‚Äô labelling scheme: http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/newsroom/150_en.htm) (Local farming and direct sales: http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/local-farming-direct- sales/index_en.htm) but remains non-committal toward the launch of labelling scheme rather relying on existing tools to promote farmgate sales (http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2013:0501:FIN:EN:PDF). On short food supply chains also see the website on organic farming (http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/consumer-trust/certification-and- confidence/short-supply-chain/index_en.htm). In North America, provincial regulators are beginning to take an interest in farmgate sales and create rules to facilitate direct sales from farms.http://www.leg.bc.ca/39th1st/1st_read/m205-1.htm External links United Kingdom: FARMA France: AMAP Austria: Gutes vom Bauernhof * Conference ‚ÄúLocal agriculture and short food supply chains‚Äù, Brussels, 20 April 2012 * European Network for Rural Development See also Community-supported agriculture Farmers' market Farm shop Local food Short food supply chains  References  * * * Category:Food retailing ","title":"Farm gate marketing"},{"id":"37936235","text":"On January 10, 1971, a by-poll was held to elect a member of parliament from one of the Sunni Muslim seats from Chouf District in the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies.Orient, Vol. 11‚Äì14.

The election was described by contemporary observers as the 'most fiery Lebanon had ever witnessed in a by-election'. There was a massive presence of security forces deployed in the constituency during the campaign and on the voting day in particular. The election was called following the death of the incumbent Progressive Socialist Party parliamentarian Anwar al-Khatib in November 1970.

The Prime Minister Saeb Salam was the most prominent figure in this drive for a middle ground. Salam also met with the Fatah leader Muhammad Yusuf an-Najjar to discuss reports of involvement of Palestinian fedayeen in the election campaign, claims that an-Najjar rebutted. In the end the fight over the seat stood between two candidates; Zahir al-Khatib (son of Anwar al-Khatib) and Hassan al-Qa'qur. Al-Khatib of the Progressive Socialist Party belonged to the camp Kamal Jumblatt. His candidature was also supported by Nahj, the Communist Party and other leftists. Al-Qa'qur, who had been defeated by the late al-Khatib in the 1968 election, was supported by an alliance consisting of ex-president Camille Chamoun's National Liberal Party, the Kataeb Party, Constitutionalists, former Nahjists and others. Al-Khatib won the seat, obtaining 22,065 votes. Al-Qa'qur obtained 18,148 votes. The election reaffirmed Jumblatt's dominance over politics in the Chouf District.

It was used on some German training aircraft during World War I. The engine was mainly produced under license by the German Nationale Automobil Gesellschaft. Development After having designed two aircraft engines for the German Kaiserpreis aero-engine competition of 1912‚Äì1913, Robert Conrad prepared an six-cylinder aircraft engine for the second Kaiserpreis competition anticipated to take place in 1914‚Äì1915. Further improvements on the engine design were done in 1915 by Robert Conrad while he was working for the Deutsche Motorenbau-Gesellschaft. His work resulted in a six-cylinder water-cooled engine with increased bore which was capable of delivering at 1400 rpm. After a successful type test in February 1916 the engine was assigned the designation C.III (C for Conrad) by the German military.Kyrill von Gersdorff, Kurt Grasmann. Flugmotoren und Strahltriebwerke, Bernard & Graefe Verlag, 1981, Due to insufficient production capacity at the Deutsche Motorenbau-Gesellschaft, the engine was produced by the Nationale Automobil Gesellschaft (NAG).

Distribution This species is uncommon but widespread in the Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea and southern Africa to French Polynesia, southern Japan, and Australia. It has been reported also from Easter Island.Discover Life Habitat  Eye close-up of P. hamrur Priacanthus hamrur is a reef-associated species, living in tropical marine waters on outer reef slopes and rocky areas and in lagoons at depths of 8 to 250 meters, but most commonly from 30 to 50 m. Description At sexual maturity the size of Priacanthus hamrur reaches in males, in females, Carpenter, K.E., Lawrence, A. & Myers, R. 2016. Priacanthus hamrur. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species but males can reach a maximum length of 45 cm.Fishbase The body of the Crescent-tail Bigeye is relatively deep, strongly compressed laterally. The eyes are very large and red (even in case of silver livery). The mouth is oblique with a protruding lower jaw and small conical teeth. The extremity of the lower lip is above the median line of the body. The dorsal fin has 13 to 15 soft rays. The pelvic fins are very large. The caudal fin has a concave indented margin which may be crescent-shaped (hence the common name). The body of these fishes goes through various phases of color, which may vary from orange to entirely red or entirely silver, or silver with broad six red bands (the first red bar crosses the eye). It is also capable of quickly changing the color. Sometimes it has a row of about fifteen small dark spots along the lateral line or large spots on upper side. The fins are red to light pink. This species is rather similar and can be confured with Priacanthus blochii and with Heteropriacanthus cruentatus. Both these last species have the caudal fin only slightly rounded.

It has traditionally been a real tree either from the Ardennes forest, from the city of Helsinki or from different countries as diplomatic gift, except in 2012 when it was replaced with an abstract sculpture. Traditional trees Traditionally, the Grand Place in the centre of Brussels hosts a real Christmas tree each year, taken from the Ardennes forest. The normal height for these trees is around high. The Grand Place itself dates from the 17th century and has played host to a Christmas market each year since 2000. 2012 tree On 30 November 2012, a high abstract-style tree was erected in the Grand Place instead of a central real Christmas tree. It was designed to work with an overall theme of light installations in the Grand Place, and allowed visitors to climb to the top of the \\"tree\\". It was constructed out of steel- framed boxes, wood and screening materials. It cost ‚Ç¨40,000 ($52,000) to construct, which was described as about a third of the price of a real tree. The Belgian press reacted negatively to the installation of the tree, with some suggesting that it was erected to avoid offending Muslims. Brussels city councillor concurred with this sentiment, and also pointed out that it marked a change of name for the annual Christmas market to \\"Winter Pleasures\\". Fellow councillor Philippe Close responded to that criticism by saying, \\"What we want is just to modernise the pleasure of winter, of this Christmas market and all the image of Brussels. The Christmas tree is not a religious symbol and actually lots of Muslims have a Christmas tree at home.\\" By 1 December, an online petition against the installation had received 11,000 signatures. By 11 December, this had increased to 25,000. Due to concerns over vandalism during New Year's celebrations in the Grand Place, it was announced in early December that the tree would be taken down on 28 December, instead of early January, as was the case with the real trees in the past.

The tower belongs to the heritage registers of Bad Kissingen and has an entry in the List of Heritage Registers in Bavaria.  History  In 1903, physician Dr. Wendelin Dietz inspired constructing a new look-out as the outlook from the top of the Ludwig Tower over Bad Kissingen turned out to be no longer sufficient. Dr. Dietz was the chairman of the Wittelsbacher Association, which was founded for the purpose of building the tower. This association was in favour of Bismarck and the Empire and competed in a certain way with the Wittelsbacher Association, which, even after the Unification of Germany, regarded Bavaria to be a sovereign kingdom and built the Bismarck Tower in Bad Kissingen in 1914.Werner Eberth: Bismarck und Bad Kissingen. Theresienbrunnen-Verlag, Bad Kissingen 1998, p. 341 The plans for the construction of the tower were made by Magistrate Council Carl Krampf; the lion sculpture on the top of the tower was designed by Valentin Weidner. The total costs amounted to 27,000 German gold marks. As, in 1906, the Kingdom of Bavaria was facing its 100th anniversary and in 1880, already, the 700th anniversary of the House of Wittelsbach had taken place, it was decided to name the new tower the Wittelsbacher Jubilee Tower. The foundation stone was laid on 1 January 1906. The inauguration on 15 September 1907 was attended by, amongst others, Bavarian Prince Regent Luitpold and the District President of Lower Franconia and Aschaffenburg, Dr. von M√ºller. In 1924, it was planned to install around the Tower a memorial for the Lower-Franconian victims of World War I. The foundation stone ceremony took place on 15 August 1925 under the participation of Bavarian Crown Prince Rupprecht; the extensive plans had to be stopped, however, due to the Great Depression.Werner Eberth: Bismarck und Bad Kissingen. Theresienbrunnen-Verlag, Bad Kissingen 1998, p. 342 The land purchased by Dr. Wendelin Dietz, where the tower was located, was first owned by Dr. Dietz's family and later by the State of Bavaria.Werner Eberth: Bismarck und Bad Kissingen. Theresienbrunnen-Verlag, Bad Kissingen 1998, p. 342f. In the 1970s, the tower was closed to the public due to deterioration but restored by the State of Bavaria well-timed to the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the House of Wittelsbach. At present, it is planned to establish the Erlebniswelt Saaletal (Adventurous World Saale Valley) with the Wittelsbacher Tower as its center.  The building  The Wittelsbacher Jubilee Tower has a total height of 33 metres. An observation deck is located at a height of 25 metres and, thus, approximately 245 metres above the valley of the Franconian Saale which can be viewed from the tower. A sculpture of a lion wearing a crown stands on the top of the tower. The Tower is made of Muschelkalk limestone while the lion sculpture, the front gate, the balustrade, and cupola consist of green sandstone. In 1930, a restaurant was established adjacent to the tower. The first restaurant built in block design, however, was destroyed in 1933, probably due to arson. It was replaced the same year by a solid building. The tower has later been extensively renovated several times. Further new structures including a private brewery and a hall have also been added.  Outlook  The top of the tower allows an outlook over Bad Kissingen, the valley of the Franconian Saale as well as the Sodenberg near Hammelburg.  Further reading  * Denis A.

Ko≈õciuszko Mound, Krak√≥w, Poland The first monument to Ko≈õciuszko in Belarus erected in 2018 Ko≈õciuszko monument, Montigny-sur-Loing, France  Poland  In Poland, nearly every major town has a street or square named for Ko≈õciuszko. Between 1820 and 1823, the people of Krak√≥w erected the Ko≈õciuszko Mound to commemorate the Polish leader. A similar mound was erected in 1861 at Olkusz. He is the patron of Krak√≥w University of Technology, Wroc≈Çaw Military University, and countless other schools and gymnasia (secondary schools) throughout Poland. He was the patron of the 1st Regiment of the Polish 5th Rifle Division, and of the 1st Division of the Polish 1st Army. After World War I the Ko≈õciuszko Squadron, and during World War II the 303rd Polish Squadron, were named for him. Two ships have been named for him: SS Ko≈õciuszko, and ORP Genera≈Ç Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko (a former United States Navy frigate that was transferred to Poland). There is a Ko≈õciuszko Monument at the entrance to Krak√≥w's Wawel Castle, where he was laid to rest. Its replica was erected in Detroit, Michigan in 1978 (pictured in gallery below). A replica of the Brigadier General Thaddeus Kosciuszko monument in Washington, D.C. by Antoni Popiel was erected in 2010 in Warsaw, Poland. The plane involved in the crash of LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 was named for him.  Belarus  In Belarus, in the manor of Mieraƒço≈≠≈°ƒçyna - the birthplace of Ko≈õciuszko - a monument was opened on May 12th, 2018.

The campaign received financing from over 700 private contributors, and a monument design by Henik Lojka won the competition. Installation of the monument was organized by the local authorities of the Ivaceviƒçy District.

Development The group was established in mid 1926, with Cahill writing to Archbishop Edward Joseph Byrne in October 1926 to inform him that his organisation had been in existence for some months and to announce the formation of a Provisional Committee featuring Sir Joseph Glynn, George Gavan Duffy, prominent judge Michael J. Lennon, J. Durnin, Patrick Waldron and three priests.Maurice Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy: Militant Catholicism in Modern Ireland, The History Press Ireland, 2010, p. 55 The new organisation attracted some prominent members, including the economist Berthon Waters, the publisher Eoin O'Keefe, Peter O'Loghlen TD, Gabriel Fallon a critic and Maurice Moynihan and O.J. Redmond, two senior members of the civil service. At lower levels the organisation established branches across Ireland, with six branches established in Dublin, two each in Cork and Kilkenny and one each in Waterford, Mullingar, Nenagh and Bray. The organisation had several hundred members at any given time although it did not retain membership, rather instructing those who joined in the intricacies of Catholic social teaching, before encouraging them to go off and spread what they had learned either independently or as members of other more community- based Catholic societies. Between 1935 and 1939 the group ran high profile Summer Schools to promote their aims and teachings.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 125 It did not however seek a mass membership, preferring an elitist structure and seeking to attract only those in positions of influence to its ranks.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 205 Aims and campaigns The object of this society was to ensure the use of Catholic Social Teaching, and embed Catholic doctrine in the legal structure, in the Irish Free State. Fr Cahill viewed with great apprehension the power of international Freemasonry, Communism and Jewry.David S Wyman, Charles H Rozenzveig: The World Reacts to the Holocaust. p. 648 The society organised public meetings three or four times a year, published pamphlets on current topics and attempted to produce a weekly paper to further its ideals. Cahill strongly supported a rural basis for Ireland and used An R√≠oghacht to further this aim. In 1928 he devised a \\"Scheme for Social Re-construction\\" which was to set up \\"Catholic Agricultural Colonies\\" that would, he argued, attract people away from the twin pulls of city life and emigration.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 56 He argued that ruralism would both encourage Irish autarky, which the group advocated, as well as a decent and wholesome lifestyle that would become the hallmark of Ireland internationally.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 113 The group also became active in support of cinema censorship, issuing a statement to the Irish Times in 1935 to indicate that it was taking over leadership of the issue from the moribund Irish Vigilance Association.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 98 As a result of their campaign the Irish government imposed heavy tariffs on the import of 35mm film and eventually helped to established, with Church support, the National Film Institute.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 100 Banking Commission The group sent a delegation to provide evidence to the Banking Commission of 1934‚Äì1938 to advocate their monetary reform aims.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 131 Their submissions mostly focused on their support for the replacement of private banking with a single National Bank of Ireland and for control of fiduciary policy to be taken away from politicians and given over to professional economists attached to this bank.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 139 The criticisms that An R√≠oghacht levelled at the eventual report by the Commission, would go on to form the basis of the economic policy of Clann na Poblachta, with Se√°n MacBride having been close to members of An R√≠oghacht.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 144 An R√≠oghacht entered into a print battle with Edward Coyne over the issue, with Coyne accusing the movement of purposefully twisting papal encyclicals to support their views, with An R√≠oghacht countering that the policies they advocated had been the same as those used by the Estado Novo which, they contended, had transformed a backward and impoverished Portugal into a successful country.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 145 The influential Fr. Denis Fahey also came out in support of An R√≠oghacht, endorsing their arguments in the Knights of Saint Columbanus journal Hibernia.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 146 In August 1938 Cahill was a keynote speaker at a Muintir na T√≠re event and he used the occasion to attack the lack of attention afforded to the An R√≠oghacht-backed Commission minority report, suggesting that it was part of a deliberate attempt to bring about the destruction of Irish agriculture.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 147 The speech was made at a point when Cahill's superiors in the Society of Jesus were having major concerns about his stern criticism of the government, with issues also raised about Cahill's competence as an economist and even his mental state.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, pp. 147‚Äì148 Eventually Cahill was ordered to be silent on the issue of monetary reform and he did not publicly raise the issue again before his 1941 death.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 154 Post-Cahill An R√≠oghacht continued to exist for around twenty years after Cahill's death and continued to be an influential organisation for much of that time. As well as the influence of their ideas on Clann na Poblachta, George Gavan Duffy became President of the High Court in 1946 and in this role had a profound impact on Article 40 of the Constitution of Ireland, which he interpreted as an extension of Catholic teaching.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 183 The organisation formed the basis of Fr. Denis Fahey's Maria Duce, a right-wing, anti-Semitic organisation, with much of its membership trained by An R√≠oghacht. Under the presidency of Brian J McCaffrey the movement was involved in a number of conservative campaigns in the 1950s, such as actively supporting members of the Waterford District Football League who were attempting to force the Republic of Ireland national football team to pull out of a match with their counterparts from Yugoslavia on the grounds that they did not wish to associate with communists.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 191 However the influence of the group was on the wane and by the early 1960s it had disappeared altogether.Curtis, A Challenge to Democracy, p. 193 References External links * The Ireland of Edward Cahill (1868‚Äì1941): a liberal or a Christian state? at History Ireland * A failed quest for a Catholic Ireland at IrishCatholic.ie Category:Conservatism in Ireland Category:Politics of the Republic of Ireland Category:History of Catholicism in Ireland Category:Christian organizations established in 1926 Category:Catholic organizations established in the 20th century ","title":"An R√≠oghacht"},{"id":"37936564","text":"The Bukla Magazine (in Slovene: Revija Bukla) (bukla is a colloquial Slovene term for \\"a book\\") is a free Slovenian monthly magazine in which current Slovene non-fiction and fiction books are reviewed.

His father was a cavalry officer and Th√©veney was educated at the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Infanterie before being commissioned as an infantry officer. He served in a number of staff and regimental appointments in France before joining the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion and seeing active service in Algeria. Th√©veney followed the regiment to Morocco where it was involved in the Zaian War against the Berbers. Th√©veney spent much of his military career in Morocco, fighting in many battles and being mentioned in dispatches several times. He served briefly against the German Army on the Western Front before returning to Morocco within a year. He led the operation that brought to an end the Zaian War in 1921 and remained in Morocco, participating in the Rif War in 1926. Th√©veney was a grand-officer of the Legion of Honour and holder of the Croix de Guerre and the Spanish Moroccan Peace Medal.  Early life  Th√©veney was born at 05.00 on 5 November 1866 in Tarascon, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne in France. His father was the then 29-year-old Ernest Th√©veney, a chevalier of the Legion of Honour and first lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Lancers and his mother was 34-year-old Hyacinthe L√©onille Allard, wife of Ernest. He was named after his maternal grandfather Jean Baptiste Allard. Jean Baptiste Th√©veney married Marie Th√©r√©se Berthe Coudere on 26 December 1887, they had no children.  Initial military career  On 30 October 1884 he volunteered for service in the French Army and was accepted as an officer-candidate at the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Infanterie. On 1 April 1885 he was promoted to 1st class officer-candidate, then corporal on 22 August and sergeant on 3 November. Th√©veney left the Ecole on 1 October 1886 and was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the 63rd Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant in that regiment on 12 July 1890 and to first lieutenant on 5 October 1892. Th√©veney was promoted to captain on 11 July 1896 and transferred to the 105th Infantry Regiment. He became a staff officer with the XIII Corps on 3 February 1897 and returned to the infantry on 9 April 1903 when he joined the 121st Infantry Regiment. From 11 July 1905 he was aide de camp of the 18th Brigade and then, from 25 December 1906, that of the 10th Division. Th√©veney studied at the staff college from 16 November 1907 until posted to the 63rd Infantry Regiment on 24 October 1908. Th√©veney was promoted to chef de bataillon (roughly equivalent to major) of the 50th Infantry Regiment on 25 December 1908. He transferred to the 47th Infantry Regiment on 24 June 1909; the 9th Infantry Regiment on 25 September 1909 and the 24th Infantry Regiment on 25 January 1910. On 29 December 1910 Th√©veney was appointed chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He returned to the 1st Infantry Division as a staff officer on 23 February 1912 and on 26 April 1913 was appointed chef du bataillon in the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion, seeing active service in Algeria from 17 May 1913.  Zaian War  alt=A portrait of General Lyautey in military uniform, seated at a small table On 22 February 1915 Th√©veney was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and assumed command of the Foreign Legion's 1st Marching Regiment. The regiment was transferred to Morocco on 15 May and took part in the Zaian War against Berber tribesmen opposed to the French protectorate. Th√©veney was appointed commander of the Sultan of Morocco's Order of Ouissam Alaouite on 8 August 1915. On 19 December 1915 he assumed command of the Fes groupe mobile (a mobile combined arms unit unique to Morocco). He was mentioned in dispatches on 7 August 1916 for his bravery and endurance in this command, achieving \\"brilliant\\" results on campaign despite the poor terrain and heavy enemy fire. Th√©veney transferred to fight the Germans on the Western Front on 6 January 1917, taking command of the 408th Infantry Regiment on 20 January. He was mentioned in dispatches again (on 25 August 1917) for his effective leadership of that unit during French offensives made within days of his assumption of command. Th√©veney's work was recognised with his appointment as an officer of the Legion of Honour on 14 April 1917. He returned to Morocco on 20 July 1917. Resident-General Hubert Lyautey soon promoted Th√©veney to colonel and placed him in command of the Tadla-Zaian territory. He was soon commended again, mentioned in dispatches on 20 December 1917 for his defence of the Rhorm El Alem post, in which he repelled two fierce assaults with minimal losses and displayed calmness under fire. Th√©veney took command of the Meknes military subdivision on 28 January 1918 before taking control of the Fes subdivision on 13 April 1919. He returned to the Tadla-Zaian command on 6 August and was again mentioned in dispatches (on 30 November 1919) for operations from 5 to 7 October in which he commanded an ad hoc formation of troops attempting to resupply Kh√©nifra and was opposed by numbers of the Ait Affi tribe which he defeated comprehensively. Th√©veney was mentioned in dispatches again in March 1921 for establishing effective French control of the front extending from Zafan to El Bordj during a 7-month campaign in which he was said to exhibit superb military skill. Lyautey ascribed a large portion of the success on the Zafan front in 1920 to Th√©veney. He was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade on 2 April 1921 and, returning to the Fes command on 15 July, subsequently led a French column which eliminated the last pocket of resistance in the Tadla-Zaian and brought about the end of the Zaian War.  Subsequent career  Th√©veney was appointed commander of the Legion of Honour on 12 July 1923. He was once more mentioned in dispatches on 28 July 1923 as commander of the Meknes subdivision for his work in the Spring offensive in the Moulouya Valley. He was praised for his men's fast marching, which enabled them to drive the enemy before them. He participated in the Rif War in northern Morocco as commander of a division and again was mentioned in dispatches, on 5 September 1926, for his cool-headedness and expert knowledge of African warfare. Th√©veney was appointed grand-officer of the Legion of Honour on 25 December 1935 by recommendation of the Minister of War, at which point he had ceased active service and was in the army reserve. Th√©veney also held the Croix de Guerre and the Spanish Moroccan Peace Medal. He died on 7 January 1960.

Its academic partners are India's Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), which rank with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the University of California at Berkeley and California Institute of Technology (Caltech), as the best technology institutions in the world. Odissi dance A leading disciple of Odissi Guru Padma Vibhushan Kelucharan Mohapatra, and Guru Deba Prasad Das, Operajita has performed worldwide and has been called \\"the best Odissi interpreter\\" by the doyen of India's dance critics, P V Subramaniam (Subbudu), of The Statesman. When Mohapatra returned to the performing stage, after a hiatus of twenty years, in the dance drama \\"Konarka\\", he cast Operajita to play the female lead opposite him. Operajita studied Odissi for twelve consecutive years with Mohapatra. Earlier, she trained under Guru Deba Prasad Das for five years; and Guru Pankaj Charan Das for two years. Her innovative choreographic pieces for Odissi have been set to music since 1979 by renowned vocalist Padma Vibhushan Pandit Chhannulal Mishra of Varanasi. A winner of many international and national awards for dance, Operajita is also a critic and scholar of the arts. She belongs to the school of Aesthetics and Art Criticism of Arthur Danto, Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University and art critic for The Nation.

Operajita was invited by the Ministry of External Affairs (India), and the Office of the Prime Minister of India, to choreograph the Rashtrapati Bhavan concert for President Barack Obama in 2010. Bharatanatyam Operajita started learning Bharatanatyam, at age six, in the grand Pandanallur style at Rishi Valley School from Guru S. Meenakshi and studied it for nine continuous years. In the early 1980s, she took master lessons in London from the iconic B. Ram Gopal (dancer) who taught her guru, S. Meenakshi. Operajita and her dance partner are the most prominent of Rishi Valley's dancers. As a professional classical dancer, she is a torchbearer of the great Rishi Valley dance tradition, which gave rise to phenomenally beautiful and successful dance dramas in Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil - in which she was always cast in the lead role - staged each year under the school's famous Banyan Tree for its founder, Jiddu Krishnamurti. The music for these productions was composed by Veena G Visalakshi, a disciple of Vizianagaram Venkataramana Das, and the text was chosen or composed by Pandit Chundi Hanumantharao. Operajita studied veena for seven years and Carnatic vocal music for nine years with Veena G Visalakshi. Operajita was invited by Rishi Valley to choreograph a dance drama for the school. She produced an episode from Kalidasa's \\"Kumarasambhavam\\" for which the original score had been composed exclusively for her by Padma Vibhushan Pandit Chhannulal Mishra of Varanasi, thereby resuscitating a great Rishi Valley dance tradition which had lain dormant for decades. Author and translator Together with her parents, Operajita has translated pre-eminent Odia author, Gopinath Mohanty's award-winning novel, \\"Amrutara Santana\\", widely regarded as his magnum opus, into English - the translation is called, \\"Amrutara Santana: The Dynasty of The Immortals.\\" It has been published by the Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, the Indian Government's official, apex literary body, in 2016.Mohanty, Gopinath.

This method has been used in 38 countries by 34 organizations. The training manual is available in English, Spanish, French, and Arabic.  History  Barrier analysis was developed in 1990 by Tom Davis, MPH (Global Sector Lead for Health & Nutrition with World Vision International) based on the health belief model and the theory of reasoned action. Since then, it has been adopted by at least 34 organizations working in 45 countries around the world to study determinants of behaviors related to child survival (health, nutrition), WASH, food security, education, sexual and reproductive health, city planning, and other areas. The methodology has continued to evolve as it has been tested in different settings. It has primarily been used for international development, although it has also been used and taught in the developed world as well (e.g. by the Baltimore City Government for analysis of trash can use, Feed the Children http://www.feedthechildren.org and Hunger Free NYChttp://www.hungerfreeamerica.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Summer%20Meals%20Barrier%20Analysis%202016_online_0.pdf to look at participation in the USDA summer meals program, and the Honey Bee Health Coalitionhttp://honeybeehealthcoalition.org).  Usage  Barrier analysis can be used at the start of a behavior change program to determine key messages and activities for intervention. It can also be used in an ongoing program, focusing on behaviors that have not changed in order to understand what is stopping it from happening.  Methodology  The purpose of barrier analysis is to identify determinants of behavior change among a specific target audience. The four most commonly found determinants are self- efficacy, social norms, positive consequences, and negative consequences. Typically researchers interview 45 \\"Doers\\" (people who already practice the behavior) and 45 \\"Non-doers\\" (people who do not practice the behavior) and compare the responses. A difference of 15 percentage points or greater between the two interviewee categories is usually statistically significant, but a special BA Tabulation Table (Link to instructions and spreadsheet) is used to test for statistical significance.

It serves parts of the Seattle metropolitan area and was opened in 2011. The plant construction and associated tunneling were a five-year megaproject costing $1.8 billion. Site description Brightwater is a facility at the intersection of State Route 9 and State Route 522 north of Woodinville. The plant itself occupies ; the remainder of the property is used for stormwater treatment and environmental mitigation such as constructed wetlands and stormwater retention. Tunnel A , tunnel was built by several tunnel boring machines from the treatment plant to a marine outfall nearly due west on Puget Sound. The outfall is below the surface. Construction delays were incurred due to unexpected soil conditions causing damage to the boring machines. The problems with the Brightwater tunnel were considered when planning other large regional tunnel projects, including the Link Light Rail Capitol Hill tunnel and the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel. The tunnel was completed in 2011, and full use of the outfall began on November 2, 2012. History In August 2002, then King County Executive Ron Sims announced that a billion-dollar regional sewage-treatment plant named \\"Brightwater\\" would be built in neighboring Snohomish County and provide service for parts of King and Snohomish counties.Metro-King County Brightwater proposal Controversies Since its proposal, Brightwater has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, including a lawsuit by King County against Snohomish County that was settled when King County agreed to pay $70 million for public safety, habitat protection, and parks in Snohomish County.Seattle Times: Deal would end most litigation over Brightwater The project has also had many cost overruns totaling over $272 million.Seattle Times: County audit levels criticism at rising Brightwater costs In December 2006, the project had resolved all its lawsuits and only needed building permits from Snohomish County. However, concerns remain over the siting of the project, both from its future neighbors worried about the smells associated with sewage treatment and geologists due to at least one active fault line running through the site, and concerns over whether a new plant was necessary when eliminating stormwater and wastewater from the sewage system.Seattle Post-Intelligencer: Brightwater treatment plant nears last hurdle, on track to open in 2010 King County countered these concerns by stating the plant will feature advanced odor control, of wildlife habitat will be restored, the plant has been designed to withstand a 7.3-magnitude earthquake, and that the project will be paid by new customers. Public art The Brightwater plant includes 15 works of public art. The $4.4 million acquisition was funded through the county One Percent for Art construction setaside program.

Campbell was the third and youngest son of James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun and his wife Margaret Montgomerie, daughter of Hugh Montgomerie, 7th Earl of Eglinton. He was the younger brother of Hugh Campbell, 3rd Earl of Loudoun. He was commissioned a Captain in the 21st Regiment of Foot in 1702, then was Lieutenant-Colonel in the 2nd Dragoons (later Royal Scots Greys) in 1706. He served under Marlborough in the War of the Spanish Succession and fought in the Battle of Blenheim. After the war, he was Colonel of the 9th Regiment of Foot from 1715 to 1717, and of the 2nd Dragoons (later Royal Scots Greys) from 1717 until his death. History of Parliament Online article by Romney R. Sedgwick. Campbell was married by contract dated 29 March 1720 to Lady Jean Boyle, eldest daughter of David Boyle, 1st Earl of Glasgow by his second wife Jean, daughter and heiress of William Mure of Rowallan. Campbell was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Ayrshire at the 1727 British general election. He was also made Groom of the Bedchamber to King George II in 1727. He was returned in a contest at the 1734 British general election. In 1735, he was promoted to Brigadier-General, and in 1738 was appointed Governor of Edinburgh Castle. He was promoted to Major-General in 1739. At the 1741 British general election he was defeated at Ayrshire by a combination of the anti-Walpole elements in Ayrshire, backed by the 2nd Duke of Argyll. Their opposition was because of his connection with the Administration and not on any personal grounds. He retained both his offices until his death. In 1742, Campbell was promoted to Lieutenant-General and in the course of the War of the Austrian Succession he accompanied the King to Germany in command of the British cavalry and fought at the battles of Dettingen in 1743, where he was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and of Fontenoy in 1745, where he lost a leg. He subsequently died of his wounds on 2 May 1745. Campbell had two children: * James, born 11 February 1726, and * Margaret, born 17 May 1727. His wife Jean had died on 19 December 1729 and was succeeded in her estate of Rowallan by their son James, who assumed the name of Mure. On 27 April 1782 he also succeeded his cousin as fifth Earl of Loudoun.

After the assassination of the king Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá, the Karadjordjevic dynasty came to power, which led to a change in the system of governance. Autocratic regime was replaced by liberal bourgeois regime of Petar the I, the civil liberties were increased and the economic situation was improved. \\"Belgrade cooperative for mutual help and savings\\" was founded in 1882 at the initiative of a group of Belgrade merchants, with the idea of investing into Serbia economy. This type of investment was a modern form of credit and an advanced method for reviving both the trading business and the market within the capitalist economy. Since 1897, when the Department of Insurance was founded, in addition to the cooperative banking activity, Belgrade Cooperative was increasingly developed as an insurance company. From being the savings fund and loaning money to the small proprietors, the Cooperative developed into the strong financial organization which loaned money to the city and state. Branches were open in Skopje and Thessaloniki. As such, it operated until 1944, representing one of the most important institutions of its kind. Some of the most important figures of economic and financial life of Serbia were once acting as a president of Belgrade Cooperative - its organizer and principal job coordinator, Luka ƒÜeloviƒá, subsequent donor and benefactor of Belgrade University, Kosta Tau≈°anoviƒá and Lazar Paƒçu, the financial leaders of Serbia of their time, public figures, prominent politicians and statesmen, as well as other well-known Belgrade businessmen, ƒêorƒëe Vajfert, Dimitirije ƒÜirkoviƒá and others. At the regular shareholders meeting in 1897, it was decided that a new building will be erected and so multiple properties were bought belonging to Krsmanoviƒá brothers, Goƒëevac brothers, Municipality of Belgrade, Vuja Rankoviƒá and Luka ƒÜeloviƒá, in close vicinity to the so-called Little Market on the Sava River. The construction began in the spring of 1905 and was completed in 1907, in the record time for that period. The total floor area covers .  The building  Interior of the building Belgrade Cooperative Building was built according to the project by two leading Belgrade architects, University professors, Andra Stevanoviƒá and Nikola Nestoroviƒá. The majority of the building was constructed on the old embankment, and since the land was underwater due to the proximity of the river, the foundation of many walls has to be made of reinforced concrete, the first time in Belgrade, but using the iron for clamps, since there were was no round iron in Belgrade at the time. The contractors of construction works were brothers Stok. All cut stone materials were made by the \\"Industry of Ripanj granite.\\" Decorations on the facades and interior, with rich decorative plastic in stucco on the walls and on the ceiling, are work of Franja Valdman, the sculptor of building ornaments. Decorative paintings in the main entrance are work of Bora Kovaƒçeviƒá and Andrea Domenico, while the paintings on glass were made by R. Markoviƒá. Belgrade cooperative moved into the new building immediately after the completion of construction in 1907 and remained there until its abolition. The building was later used by the Geological Geophysical Institute \\"Jovan ≈Ωujoviƒá\\". The social status of the Belgrade Cooperative dictated that the representativeness and monumentality become the only possible architectural concept. Ceremonial hall It was designed in the style of academism, with elements borrowed from both eclectic academic style, as well as contemporary Art Nouveau architecture. It was built as a monumental corner building with three wings in the floor plan at the irregular plot. The most representative part of the building is the prominent and jagged central part, where the public rooms are located, with the main facade in Karadjordjeva Street. The wings in Travniƒçka and Hercegovaƒçka Streets in which the workrooms are located have simple facades with uniform peaceful rhythm and different composition in every elevation. The central wing facing the street has two floors ‚Äì the entrance and the ceremonial hall with the vestibule that extends through two floors and one storey Counter hall in the rear, while both side wings have a ground floor and two floors. Shops were once located on the ground floor of the side wings while the administrative and management offices were on the first floor. The Belgrade Cooperative building was built using mixed techniques. Cellars, which extend beneath the entire building, are made of reinforced concrete, with Prussian vaults. Most of the building was built using a standard procedure, brick in lime mortar, and only partly in reinforced concrete. Bridging is architrave for the side wings, and the architrave and arch in the middle wing. Lantern construction above the central staircase is resolved in the form of triangular metal grille. Roofs have jamb walls, small slope and domes. Fa√ßade which is facing the street is made in stone slabs in socle zone and dressed in artificial stone, while the courtyard fa√ßade is plastered. Structural system has vaults and marble columns. Main staircases are three-armed, stone or marble, while side staircases are spiral and iron. The interior walls are plastered and painted, while the representative rooms are decorated with wall paintings and marble imitation and have pilasters with gilded capitals and applied polychrome decorative female masks. The floors have parquet or terrazzo tiles. On the facades decoration was made of artificial stone, while the interior is in stucco and plaster. Interior of the building Building by night, after the reconstruction All the decorative motifs of Belgrade Cooperative Building are borrowed from post Renaissance, predominantly Baroque, but modernly interpreted to form the unique style expression. Frontal facade is dominated by the large glass surface above which is a dome with merlon flanked by sculptural group consisting of a female figure, the personification of Serbia and four children's figures that embody the Industry. In the niches on the side projections of the main fa√ßade are the figures of a Woman with beehive and a Man with a scroll. Inside the building in the main hall, at the beginning of the staircase there are two counterpart figures of a young woman in the form of a chandelier. Above the gallery in the main hall there is a sculptural group consisting of a female figure with a crown, again a symbol of Serbia and two children figures representing the insurance and banking. Metal figure, probably an import, is gilded, as well as all stucco decoration. On the top of pilaster strips, above the windows of the first floor and in the amount of ground-floor windows on the side walls there is a number of reliefs in the form of female masks, while the mask of Mercury is positioned above the entrance. The unity of architecture and applied decorative arts in the interior of the Belgrade Cooperative building is clearly visible. That kind of unity is particularly valued in European architecture from the late 19th and early 20th century and is known as the \\"synthesis of art\\". This \\"synthesis of art\\" is extremely rare in Belgrade architecture and it makes Belgrade Cooperative building a unique creation. Each of the decorative elements, such as the paintings on the walls and ceilings, sculptures, stucco decorations, chandeliers and appliqu√© on the walls, painted glass parapet at the Counter- hall or glass surfaces of windows and doors of the main hall, are distinctive features which is why Belgrade Cooperative became a cultural monument in 1966. The building is often named as one of the most beautiful buildings in Belgrade.  Reconstruction  Belgrade Cooperative Building was renovated several times. The most important changes in the construction and architectural structure were made in 1956/57 and 1958/59. During those years, the Geological Geophysical Institute made a decision to extend the building by adding the third floor above both wings in Travniƒçka and Hercegovaƒçka streets, and then three floors above the central wing in the yard around the former Counter hall. These extensions altered the general appearance of the building by removing the wing‚Äôs domes, the attic became floor, windows and doors in the ground floor were walled up and shop doors become windows of offices. Merlon was removed from the central dome as well as the clock from the main fa√ßade. The Counter-hall inside the block remained on the ground floor and it was lit through light well. Belgrade Cooperative is one of the most significant buildings in Belgrade and Serbian architecture in the first decade of the 20th century and one of the most successful achievements of architects Andra Stevanoviƒá and Nikola Nestoroviƒá. Architectural concept, compliance of building‚Äôs functional and compositional elements, rich sculptural and decorative plastics, style consistency, construction quality, new construction methods used for the first time, new materials and other architectural features put this building among the most representative palaces in Belgrade architecture. Belgrade Cooperative building is one of the few buildings that represent the beginning of the modern reconstruction of Belgrade along the Sava embankment. Belgrade Cooperative Building is a cultural monument of value for the Republic of Serbia since 1979 (Decision, \\"Slu≈æbeni glasnik SRS\\" no. 14/79). City's Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments drafted the reconstruction project for the building in 2009. Authored by Aleksandra ≈†eviƒá and Ljiljana Konta, the project was to include the complete rebuilding of the, today non-existing, two side domes. They were to be built of wood and steel and look the same as the small domes on the head fa√ßade. Deteriorated sculpture on the front dome was to be removed and replaced by the new one, made of metal. A mast, which once stood on the central dome, will also be rebuilt and also serve as the lightning rod. Due to the lack of funds, the project didn't go on.  References   Literature  * S.

The second oldest of four brothers ‚Äì his father was a mining executive who eventually moved the family to British Columbia ‚Äì Stogran thought regular snowball fights were boring, so he organized games of skins versus shirts. Fishing trips became endurance tests and overnight camping were a survival game. He acquired a martial arts third- degree black belt. In 1976, after high school, Stogran went to Royal Roads Military College in Victoria, British Columbia, as a way to get an electrical engineering degree in exchange for military service after graduation. He also holds a Master of Strategic Studies from the United States Army War College. Military career Stogran graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in 1980 and was commissioned in Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. His initial employment was with that regiment's Third Battalion in CFB Esquimalt in British Columbia. In the latter half of the 1980s, he was employed as the regimental adjutant of the Canadian Airborne Regiment in CFB Petawawa in Ontario. In 1993, Stogran served in the Bosnian War as a Military Observer. He was subsequently awarded a Mentioned-in-Dispatches for courage under fire.

Veterans' Ombudsman In 2007, after taking office, the Conservative government passed the New Veterans Charter and the Veterans Bill of Rights in accordance with its campaign promises. Among other changes, the Office of the Veterans Ombudsman was created. The ombudsman was to report directly to the Minister of Veterans Affairs and would independently ensure the department's compliance with the Veterans Bill of Rights. On October 15, 2007, Stogran was appointed as Canada's first Veterans Ombudsman. In 2010, a spokesman for Veterans Affairs Canada confirmed Stogran's appointment would not be renewed. The department would not comment on its reason for not renewing his appointment, although several commentators suggested it was due to his outspokenness and criticism of the Conservative government.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyX_Yo2740k In November 2010, Stogran was replaced by retired Chief Warrant Officer Guy Parent, who was given a five-year term. Later life After leaving the ombudsmanship, Stogran spoke frequently about veteran's rights, including his own struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He set up a website, The Rebel Gorilla,http://www.therebelgorilla.com/about-us/ to help showcase veterans' issues. He has found music to be therapeutic; he plays folk guitar. He holds concerts and uses that opportunity to raise awareness of the precarious state of Canada's veterans and PTSD. He started an organization, Singing for Change, to raise money for Wounded Warriors Canada. On April 20, 2017, Stogran announced his candidacy for the federal leadership of the New Democratic Party. He withdrew his candidacy on June 3, 2017, after complaining that there were too many obstacles preventing candidates from growing the party from the grassroots. Personal He has a wife and two grown children.

In 1627, French Cardinal Richelieu introduced the Seigneurial system of New France. Almost all of the early French Canadians who came as officers in the military or filled important official positions within the colony in New France came from the ranks of the French nobility. Under the Ancien R√©gime, several of these men were promoted to more senior ranks within the Peerage of France. From the early 1700s, it became customary for the Governors of New France to be given the title marquis. Except for the Marquis de Vaudreuil and the Marquis de Beauharnois, most were in Canada only for a few years before returning to France and are therefore not counted as Canadians. The Baronetage of Nova Scotia (a British hereditary title, but not a peerage) had been devised by King James VI of Scotland in 1624 as a means of settling Nova Scotia. Except for Sir Thomas Temple, almost none of them came to Nova Scotia, therefore they are counted as British, not Canadian. Following the British Conquest of New France in 1763, the likes of Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst (Lord Amherst) and Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester (Lord Dorchester) were raised to the Peerage of Great Britain for their part in the taking of Canada and as Governors General of Canada, but they were not Canadians. As the colony grew under British rule both in terms of geography and economy, baronetcies began to be conferred upon various Canadian politicians, military commanders and businessmen. In 1891, Lord Mount Stephen became the first Canadian to be elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The significant losses of the First World War included many direct heirs to titles and some replacements were found in Canada, resulting in the acquisition of titles by Canadians who, as British subjects, were eligible to inherit. After the controversial elevation of Lords Atholstan and Beaverbrook to the Peerage of the United Kingdom, the Nickle Resolution was presented to the House of Commons of Canada in 1917 requesting the Sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies or peerages to Canadians. This triggered the Canadian titles debate and led to a separate system of orders, decorations, and medals for Canada. Canadians who were granted peerages after that date had to hold or acquire British citizenship, such as Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet. However, the then Canadian Citizenship Act provided that Canadians who acquired foreign citizenship by any means other than marriage would renounce their Canadian citizenship.

Assault The attack was preceded by at least five rockets being fired towards the airport. Three of those landed within the facility, which also houses a Pakistani Air Force base, while the other two hit nearby residential areas. The heavily armed militants then rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall, sparking a firefight with troops posted nearby. Officials at the Khyber Teaching Hospital said they had received the bodies of four civilians, and that more than 40 others had been injured, including children, women and senior citizens, many of whom who were hit by bullets or shrapnel from rockets. Senior official Umar Ayub described the condition of at least four of the wounded as serious. Security officials said five terrorists were killed in the gun battle with troops, and no one managed to actually enter the airport itself. Bomb disposal experts defused four suicide jackets. Reactions Defence minister Naveed Qamar said the attack was well planned out and terrorists were heavily armed, however the response by the security forces ensured there had been no damage to property or loss of life within the airport. A Pakistan Air Force spokesman released a statement, saying that \\"Security forces were fully alert and responded to the attack... There is no damage to equipment and personnel\\". Officials from the Civil Aviation Authority said the airport was shut down after the attack began and all flights coming to Peshawar were diverted to Islamabad and Lahore. Additional security forces were deployed around the airport and troops searched houses in nearby neighbourhoods. Responsibility The banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group told reporters in the country's northwest that the target of the attackers was the PAF airbase. The assault was reportedly launched from a nearby village named Abdra, according to a PAF spokesman, who added that a joint counter-terrorism operation by several security agencies was under way. The BBC reported that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan also played a role in the attack.

Its video on demand release date was May 1, 2013, and its US theater release date was June 7, 2013. Plot A young man named Scat comes up with a new idea for a drink after he drops his drink and swears, calling it 'FUKK'. He goes to Addison Cola Company where he maneuvers a meeting with a formidable marketing executive, Six, by triggering the fire alarm. While mediocre, she tells him that she and her team will polish it before it is presented to the board. During the meeting, the board shows some resistance but Six informs them that Scat is willing to give up trademark provisions for a mere two million. Scat then realizes he has not reserved the trademark and scrambles to the Patent and Trademark Office only to find out that his roommate, Sneaky Pete, stole his idea and registered it earlier that morning. Success befalls Pete as 'FUKK' becomes the highest selling energy drink in the nation. Embittered, Scat goes back to his ordinary life but is later recruited by Six to help her come up with a new ad campaign after she is booted off the 'FUKK' campaign and relegated to Addy Classics. Instructed to come up with a brilliant idea by Friday (only five days away), Scat moves in with Six and is unable to think of anything until only moments before the deadline. After shaking a vending machine in frustration and Six telling him that twelve people have died by being crushed by vending machines, he comes up with the idea of 'Wouldn't you die for a Fukk' advertising a cartoon where people die by being crushed by vending machines because they want the drink so badly. The ad is accepted and aired but a young teenager dies by being crushed by a vending machine and the ad is now considered insensitive and taken off air. Scat and Six attend the funeral and when Scat makes a speech, Six points out that all the mourners are actors that she recognizes from ads. Scat quickly realizes that Sneaky Pete created this fake death to get their ad to fail, and he quickly pulls out the fake body from the coffin and holds it up for all to see. Scat is fired while believing that Six remains at the company. In reality, Six quit when Addison refused to keep Scat, now working at a shoe store. After a brief stint as a rickshaw driver, Scat is hired by a rival company and Six is also poached. As Scat and Six are being hired Six drops a name tag from her work, possibly revealing a glimpse of her real name (appearing to be Elizabeth), before she quickly covers and retrieves the name tag. The two must come up with a new drink idea and after talking about their attraction for each other, Scat comes up with the idea of 'Average KOK'. He presents this as a drink to the board and also thinks of a different drink just called 'KOK' that they give to celebrities. The normal 'KOK's are numbered up to 100 and each number represents a celebrity and the celebrity deems who can drink their numbered drink. After the frenzy for the drink that they can't have, Scat and the company decide to make the drink go public but not before the suicide of a teenager who killed himself after not being 'cool' enough to drink his lucky number 17's corresponding drink. After confirming that this time the death is real, Scat goes on TV to apologize but ends up pointing out that drink sales have never been higher even after the death and that people, like him, 'have a dream'. Scat walks along watching himself on the TV displays and Six finds him. Scat tells her his real name is 'Michael' and asks for her real name. They kiss, but Six insists that \\"Six\\" is her name. Scat says, \\"It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Six,\\" and walks away.

For hundreds of years, the sword became a symbol of a rightful sovereignty and power in Malay culture. It was first inherited by Sang Nila Utama the founder of Singapura, later by Parameswara the first ruler of Melaka Sultanate, and then by Muzaffar Syah I the first Sultan of Perak. The sword is now a part of the Perak Sultanate's official regalia. Etymology The name of the sword has several transliterations depending on the root manuscript. The word cura is Sanskrit for knife or dagger while Mandakini (sometimes spelled Mandangkini or Manjakini) refers to the Mandakini River. Thus Cura Si Mandakini is generally accepted as meaning \\"blade of the Mandakini\\". Another theory interprets the name as coming from the Tamil-Sanskrit curik meaning to cleave, man deriving from mantra, and dakini referring to the mythological figures in Hindu- Buddhist belief. Legend Tradition in the Malay Annals hold that the founder of the major line of rulers in the Malay world was a prince named Sang Sapurba who alleged to be the descendant of Alexander The Great with his Indian wife. Sang Sapurba, then known as Sri Nila Pahlawan first revealed himself with his younger brothers, Sri Krishna Pandita and Sri Nila Utama, upon the sacred hill of Seguntang in the hinterland of Palembang. The princes were later descended into the great plain watered by the Palembang river, where Sang Sapurba married Wan Sendari, the daughter of the local chief, Demang Lebar Daun, and was everywhere accepted as ruler of the land. At a later date Sang Sapurba is said to have crossed the great central range of Sumatra into the Minangkabau Highlands, where one of his warriors, Permasku Mambang, slew the great serpent Saktimuna using the legendary sword, and was made the king of a grateful people and the founder of the long line of Princes of Minangkabau.

The medieval Arabs imported camphor by sea from the East Indies for aromatic uses and medical uses. Medieval Arabic general-purpose dictionaries say kƒÅf≈´r is \\"well-known\\". Among the Latins the records begin in the late 9th century (with spelling cafora) though records are scarce until the 12th century.Book An Historical Geography of Camphor by R.A. Donkin, year 1999, 300 pages, includes chapters on the use of camphor by the medieval Arabs and the medieval Latins. See also etymology of French camphre @ CNRTL.fr. The word is in Greek as kaphoura circa 1075 in Simeon Seth, a writer influenced by Arabic medicine. A couple of records exist in Greek that may date from centuries earlier than Simeon Seth though the dating is afflicted with uncertainties. Camphor has no records among the ancient Greeks and Romans under any name. Another imported East Indies wood product which had both aromatic and medical uses in late medieval Europe and had Arabic word ancestry is sandalwood, from Arabic ÿµŸÜÿØŸÑ sandal.English \\"sandalwood\\" descends from medieval Latin sandalus  sandalum, which is ultimately from Sanskrit ƒçandana = \\"sandalwood\\". The sandalwood aromatic wood came from the Indies. In medieval Arabic it was called sandal and was commonly used and well-known (examples). The word is in Greek in Late Antiquity as santalon. Some etymology dictionaries derive the medieval Latin from the Greek with disregard for the Arabic. Others derive the medieval Latin from the Arabic with disregard for the Greek on the grounds that (1) Arabic (especially Yemeni) seafarers were the main providers of sandalwood to medieval Europe; and (2) the 'd' in the Arabic can explain how the Latin has a 'd'; and (3) the Latin emerges too late for a Greek source to be likely: CNRTL.fr cites the 11th-century medical writer Constantinus Africanus for the earliest record of sandalus  sandalum in Latin. The book The Moluccas and the Traffic in Spices up to the Arrival of Europeans, by Robin A. Donkin, year 2003, has some early history for sandalwood in Europe on pages 110, 114, 116, and 122; and some more ancient and medieval history for sandalwood is in the book An Historical Geography of Camphor, by Robin A. Donkin, year 1999. According to these two books, the word's first document in Greek in the 1st century AD in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, spelled santalinon, and it is present but rare in Greek sources in the early centuries AD, and there is one record in Late Classical Latin as santalium (clearly borrowed from the Greek), but when Constantinus Africanus used it as sandalus  sandalum in the late 11th century the word had been absent in Latin for over six centuries, or more exactly the books' author does not know of a surviving record from all those intervening centuries. Many records are in later medieval Latin. The medieval Arabs used sandalwood in medicine (e.g.) and that was copied by the late medieval Latins (e.g.). As a reflection of the widespread later-medieval use of sandalwood the word is in late medieval English, German, French, Italian and Iberian Romance languages (all spelling it with a 'd'). Dictionaries deriving the Latin & Western name from the Arabic name include ref, ref, ref, ref, ref, ref, ref, ref, ref, ref, ref, and others, while the dictionary at ref sits on the fence on the question. The scientific or New Latin name for the sandalwood tree genus is Santalum, a wordform that arose as a Renaissance-era re-fashioning from the Greek, says CNRTL. Ultimately, camphor is derived from the Sanskrit karp≈´ra, referring to camphor throughout India since ancient times. ;candy: ŸÇŸÜÿØ qand + ŸÇŸÜÿØŸä qandƒ´, sugared. Cane sugar developed in ancient India. Medieval Persian qand = \\"cane sugar\\" is believed to have probably come from Sanskritic.An ancient Sanskrit text called Arthashastra has word khanda meaning cane sugar made in a certain way ‚Äì The Sugar Cane Industry: An Historical Geography from its Origins to 1914, by J.H. Galloway, year 1989, page 20. Khanda in Sanskritic has a broad meaning of \\"broken\\" and is used as a qualifier on sugars in India still today ‚Äì Yule & Burnell, year 1903. It has the potential to have been the parent of the Persian qand = \\"sugar\\". In subtle contrast, medieval Arabic qand more often meant \\"the juice or honey of sugar cane\\" (www.Baheth.info). The Arabic qand was probably from the Persian qand, in view of the historical diffusion evidence that sugar cultivation spread from India into Iran and then went from Iran into the Arabic-speaking countries. The historical diffusion evidence is reported in the chapter \\"The Origin and Expansion of Sugar Production in the Islamic World\\" in the book Sugar in the Social Life of Medieval Islam, by Tsugitaka Sato, year 2014; and reported likewise in J.H. Galloway's book page 24. The plant is native to a tropical climate. The medieval Arabs grew the plant with artificial irrigation and exported some of the product to the Latins. The word candi entered all the Western European languages in the later medieval centuries.Many medieval Arabic dictionaries, including the al-SihƒÅh dictionary dated about 1003, have ŸÇŸÜÿØ qand defined firstly as the juice or honey of sugar cane. Secondly they define qand as this juice solidified. Arabic qandƒ´ = \\"from qand\\" or \\"of qand\\". In medieval Arabic texts qand is a somewhat frequent word. But qandƒ´ is very hard to find. Although qandƒ´ is very rare in the texts, qandƒ´ is usually preferred to qand as the parent of the European \\"candy\\" for phonetic and syntactic reasons. Candy's earliest known dates in the European languages: French candi = 1256; Italian-Latin √ßucari canti (sugar candy) = soon after 1259; Anglo-Latin candy = 1274; Italian candi = 1310; Spanish cande = 1325‚Äì1326; Netherlands Dutch candijt and candi = 2nd half of 14th century; German kandith = probably circa 1400, German zuckerkandyt = 1470; English candy = circa 1420. An English-to-Latin dictionary dated circa 1440 has English sukyr candy translated as Latin sucura de candia. The word is rare in English until the later 16th century.

In medieval Arabic the word was also used with the meaning of 1/24th of the money value of a gold dinar coin. In the Western languages the word was adopted as a measurement term for the proportion of gold in a gold alloy, especially in a gold coin, beginning in Italy in the mid-13th century, occurring soon after some city-states of Italy started new issues of pure gold coins.For the meaning of qƒ´rƒÅt in medieval Arabic see ·∏≥ƒ´rƒÅ·π≠ @ Brill's Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition, Volume 4 page 1024 and ŸÇŸäÿ±ÿßÿ∑ @ Baheth.info . In the early records of the word carat in medieval French and English, it referred to the purity of gold, most often of gold coins, and is seen additionally as a unit of weight only later on ‚Äì ref: DMF, ref: MED. The French and English came from Italian. The first known records in the West are in Italian-Latin and Italian in the mid-13th century ‚Äì CNRTL.fr, TLIO, Minervini anno 2012 pages 20‚Äì21. For five centuries before 1250, no State or kingdom in Western Christendom issued gold coins, except for a few short-lived, relatively minor issuances in Iberia and Sicily (for details on the exceptions see Ref). Silver was the metal of choice for money in the West in those centuries. Starting in 1252 in Republic of Genoa, 1252 in Republic of Florence, and 1284 in Republic of Venice, the Italian city-states started issuing 24-carat gold coins. These were well received, and other States soon followed their example, including France in 1290 and England in 1344. During the five centuries prior to 1250, gold coins were almost continually minted by the Arabs and the Byzantine Greeks. During those centuries in both Arabic and Greek the word carat was in use in the sense of 1/24th of a gold coin; i.e., Arabic qƒ´rƒÅt was 1/24th of the Arabic dinar and Greek keration was 1/24th of the Greek bezant. It is possible that the Italians borrowed the word from both Arabic and Greek concurrently. Greater details on the word's history are at English Words That Are Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #49. ;caravan : ŸÇŸäÿ±ŸàÿßŸÜ qaƒ´rawƒÅn, convoy of travelers journeying together, which could be a merchant convoy or military or other convoy. Qaƒ´rawƒÅn is in all the main medieval Arabic dictionaries. It is somewhat frequently used in medieval Arabic writings, even though not nearly as frequently as the synonymous Arabic qƒÅfila. In the Western languages the word has records since the 12th century. The early records are in Latin and they include carvana (1190), caravana (1217), caravanna (1219-1225), karavenna (1250).Caravanna @ Du Cange's Glossary of Medieval Latin (in Latin). Also caravana @ Niermeyer's Glossary of Medieval Latin. Possibly slightly earlier is Latin caravana (reportedly 1161). From southern Italy, referring to a caravan of sailing ships, is Latin carabana (1240).Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia, by Girolamo Caracausi, year 1983 on page 157 (in Italian). All of those Latin records use the word with the same meaning as the Arabic word. The word with this meaning has been continuously in use in the Western languages since then. In Italian, late medieval merchants have it in several kinds of applications contexts, spelled carovana  caravana.Carovana @ Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini (TLIO). It is pretty common in late medieval Italy (e.g., is in Boccaccio's Decameron and Pegolotti's Mercatura). It is not common in French and English until the later 16th century, but French does have late medieval caravane and English has late 15th century carvan.Caravane @ Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran√ßais, Caravane @ Godefroy's Dictionnaire de l'Ancienne Langue Fran√ßaise, Carvan @ Middle English Dictionary. See also Les emprunts arabes et grecs dans le lexique fran√ßais d‚ÄôOrient (XIIIe-XIVe si√®cles), by Laura Minervini, year 2012, on pages 21-22. The year 1598 Italian-English dictionary of John Florio has Italian caravana translated to English as English caravan. Arabic qaƒ´rawƒÅn came from Persian kƒÅrwƒÅn with same meaning. Back in the context of the 12th and 13th century, any Persian word would necessarily have to have had intermediation through some other language in order to arrive in a Western language, because there was no contact between Persian and Western languages at the time. In practice the intermediary was Arabic. The majority of the 12th and 13th century Latin records of this word involve travellers in Arabic- speaking lands, especially Latin Crusaders in the Levant, and none are in Iranian-speaking lands. ;caraway (seed) : ŸÉÿ±ŸàŸäÿß karawiyƒÅ  ŸÉÿ±ÿßŸàŸäÿß karƒÅwiyƒÅ, caraway. The word with that meaning is quite common in mid-medieval Arabic. Spelled \\"caraway\\" in English in the 1390s in a cookery book. The English word came from Arabic via medieval Romance languages.Al-karawiyƒÅ = \\"caraway\\" is in medieval general-purpose dictionaries in Arabic (www.Baheth.info), and it is mentioned multiple times by the author of the 10th century Nabataean Agriculture (ref), and dozens of times in the cookery book of Ibn Sayyar al- Warraq (flourished 10th century) (ref), and it occurs in the medical books of Al-Razi (died c. 930) (ref) and Ibn Sina (died 1037) (ref), and in the geography book of Ibn Hawqal (died 988) (ref), and in the agriculture book of Ibn al-'Awwam (died not long after 1200) (ref), and other medieval Arabic writers (ref). Ibn al-'Awwam in Andalusia in the late 12th century described how to grow a crop of caraway seeds. An Arabic cookery book from 13th century Andalusia has dozens of recipes that use caraway seeds as a spice (ref, ref). From the Andalusian Arabic, medieval Spanish and Catalan had alcarahueya  alcarauia  alcarauea = \\"caraway\\" (starting year 1250 per Corominas). Modern Spanish is alcaravea. Medieval Sicilian Italian had caruya  caruye = \\"caraway\\" with date before 1312 (ref: Caracausi) and its word-form shows it is undoubtedly from the Arabic. Medieval Latin carui  carvi = \\"caraway\\" appears to have come at least in part from the same Arabic, but there is a question and lack of clarity about this because classical Greek karo  karon  karos, classical Latin careum and medieval Latin caruum  carea designated various aromatic seeds, among different writers, and in most cases it is not clear what species the writer was referring to. In the classical records the name is uncommon and the species it names is never clear. For example Dioscorides in Greek in the 1st century AD said \\"Karo[s] is a... little seed.... It has much the same nature as anise. The boiled root is edible as a vegetable.\\" ‚Äì ref, ref. Many aromatic seeds (including caraway) can be fitted to that statement within the botanical family Apiaceae. The book A History of the Principal Drugs of Vegetable Origin (year 1879) reports about caraway: \\"It is not noticed by St. Isidore, archbishop of Seville in the 7th century, though he mentions fennel, dill, coriander, anise, and parsley [all in the family Apiaceae]; nor is it named by St. Hildegard in Germany in the 12th century. Neither have we found any reference to it in the Anglo-Saxon Herbarium of Apuleius, written circa A.D. 1050, or in other works of the same period, though cumin, anise, fennel, and dill are all mentioned. On the other hand, in two German medicine-books of the 12th and 13th centuries... and in a Welsh medicine book of the 13th century... the seeds appear to have been in use [medicinally]. Caraway was certainly in use in England at the close of the 14th century [culinarily].\\" ‚Äì ref. Carui = \\"caraway\\" occurs more than a dozen times in the influential Latin medical writer Constantinus Africanus (died c. 1087) who took the bulk of his content from Arabic medical sources ‚Äì ref. The records for caraway in Christian Western Europe grow briskly from the 12th century onward while being absent in Latin in the medieval centuries before Constantinus. This can be taken as one sign that the word arrived from the Arabic. As another sign, late medieval English has it as caraway, also carwy, and the first record in English is carewy (1282), and these English wordforms do not exhibit Latin parentage: The letter 'w' was created to represent a sound that does not occur in Latin (Latin texts do not use the letter 'w' except in some Germanic names) and the words of the English language with the letter 'w' are rarely of Latin descent. Middle English Dictionary has a set of examples of caraway in late medieval English. ;carob : ÿÆÿ±ŸëŸàÿ® kharr≈´b, carob. Carob beans and carob pods were consumed in the Mediterranean area from ancient times, and had several names in classical Latin. But a name of roughly around carrubia is in Latin from only the 11th or 12th century onward.Regarding \\"carob\\", medieval Arabic had two spellings, kharr≈´b and kharn≈´b. Both spellings are listed by medieval Arabic dictionaries. A medical encyclopedia in Latin by Matthaeus Silvaticus dated 1317 listed the Latin spellings karnub, carnub, karubia, carrubia, currubia ‚Äì ref. A very early Latin record, from the 11th century, is reported at CNRTL.fr. The Arabic kharr≈´b has predecessors in ancient Assyrian and early medieval Syriac as ·∏´ar≈´bu  ·∏•ar≈´b = \\"carob\\" ‚Äì ·∏´ar≈´bu @ Assyrian (Akkadian) Dictionary and ·∏•rwb @ Aramaic (Syriac) Dictionary. The late medieval Latin word is the parent of today's Italian carruba, French caroube, English carob. ;check, checkmate, chess, exchequer, cheque, chequered, unchecked, checkout, checkbox, checkbook ... : ÿ¥ÿßŸá shƒÅh, king in the game of chess. The many uses of \\"check\\" in English are all descended from Persian shah = \\"king\\" and the use of this word in the game of chess to mean \\"check the king\\". Chess was introduced to medieval Europe through Arabs. The medieval Arabs probably pronounced the last h in shƒÅh harder and more forcefully than how shah is pronounced in English or in today's Arabic.When borrowing a word from Persian whose last letter was ŸÄŸá h, medieval Arabic tended to change the last letter to q or j. Some medieval examples are in Lammens, year 1890 page 103. This is evidence that Persian terminal ŸÄŸá h was pronounced \\"hard\\" in Arabic.Reported in \\"An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language\\" by Walter W. Skeat (year 1888). Downloadable at Archive.org. The word is in 11th century Catalan-Latin as escac, then 12th century French as eschac, giving rise to 12th century French eschec,More details at CNRTL.fr Etymologie in French language. Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales (CNRTL) is a division of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. which the English \\"check\\" derives from.

Italian has scaco mato = \\"checkmate\\" in the 12th century.Medieval Italian sacco documented in Tesoro della Lingua Italiana delle Origini (TLIO). The English word chess arrived from medieval French esches  eschas = \\"chess\\" which was the grammatical plural of eschec  eschac = \\"check\\".Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran√ßais has a collection of examples from late medieval French. 11th century Catalan-Latin has grammatical plural escachs = \\"chess\\" from grammatical singular escac = \\"check\\".Documentos ling√ºisticos catalanes, s. X-XII, by Luis Rubio Garc√≠a, year 1979, word escachs. Date of the first record of escac is 1045, per Diccionari.cat (in Catalan) ; chemistry : See alchemy. ;cipher, decipher : ÿµŸÅÿ± sifr, zero, i.e. the zero digit in the Arabic number system. The use of zero as one of the elementary digits was a key innovation in the Arabic number system. Latin cifra was the parent of English cipher (or cypher). The word came to Latin Europe with Arabic numbers in the 12th century. In Europe the meaning was originally numeral zero as a positionholder, then any positional numeral, then numerically encoded message. The last meaning, and decipher, dates from the 1520s in English, 1490s in French, 1470s in Italian. But in English cipher also continued to be used as a word for nought or zero until the 19th century.Nathan Bailey's English Dictionary in year 1726 defined zero as \\"a word used for cypher or nought especially by the French\\" ‚Äì ref. Samuel Johnson's English Dictionary in 1755 and 1785 did not include the word zero at all. The usual names for zero in English from the late medieval period until well into the 19th century were \\"nought\\" and \\"cifre\\"  \\"cipher\\" ‚Äì ref1a, ref1b, ref2a, ref2b, ref3. Meanwhile, the use of \\"cipher\\" & \\"decipher\\" to mean \\"encrypt\\" & \\"decrypt\\" started in English in the 16th century, borrowed from French ‚Äì ref ;civet (mammal), civet (perfume) : ÿ≤ÿ®ÿßÿØ zabƒÅd, civet perfume, a musky perfume excreted from a gland in ŸÇÿ∑ÿ∑ ÿßŸÑÿ≤ÿ®ÿßÿØ qatat al-zabƒÅd = \\"civet cats\\". The medieval Arabs obtained civet from the African civet and from various civets of the Indies.The geography book of Al-Masudi (died 956) said the perfume zabƒÅd was taken from a cat-like animal in India. The geography book of Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi (died 1327) said the African civet produced better zabƒÅd than the Indies' civets. Those statements by Al-Masudi and al-Dimashqi were noted in Remarques sur les mots fran√ßais d√©riv√©s de l'arabe, by Henri Lammens, year 1890. ZabƒÅd is closely related in form to the Arabic ÿ≤ÿ®ÿØ zabad = \\"foam\\" but is not necessarily derived from it. The word is in 15th-century Italian as zibetto = \\"civet perfume\\". Records of the form civet start in Catalan 1372 and French 1401 (cf. e.g. Latin liber -> French livre; Arabic al-qobba -> Spanish alcoba -> French alcove). Incidentally the botanical genus Abelmoschus got its name from Arabic ÿ≠ÿ®Ÿë ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ŸÉ habb el-misk = \\"musk seed\\", a seed yielding a musky perfume.The \\"musk seed\\" or \\"abelmosk\\" plant is native to tropical Asia and requires a long growing season (ref). It was in irrigated cultivation in Egypt in the late 16th and early 17th centuries and that was when European taxonomists got specimens of it from Egypt and adopted the name from Egypt ‚Äì ref: Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der botanischen Pflanzennamen, by Helmut Genaust, year 1996. The Latin botanist Prospero Alpini (died 1617) visited Egypt in the 1580s. He called the plant \\"Abelmosch\\", \\"Aegyptii Mosch\\", and \\"Bammia Muschata\\", where ÿ®ÿßŸÖŸäÿ© bƒÅmiya is Arabic for okra, aka Abelmoschus esculentus, mosch is Latin for musk, Aegypti is Latin for Egypt, and Abel is an Italian-Latin representation of Arabic habb el- = \\"seed\\" ‚Äì De Plantis Exoticis, by Prospero Alpini (in Latin, published 1629). It is written \\"hab el mosch \\" in De Plantis Aegyptiis Observationes et Notae ad Prosperum Alpinum, by Johann Veslingius, in Latin, year 1638. ;coffee, caf√© : ŸÇŸáŸàÿ© qahwa, coffee. Coffee drinking originated in Yemen in the 15th century. Qahwa (itself of uncertain origin) begot Turkish kahve. Turkish phonology does not have a /w/ sound, and the change from w to v in going from Arabic qahwa to Turkish kahve can be seen in many other loanwords going from Arabic into Turkish (e.g. Arabic fatwa -> Turkish fetva). The Turkish kahve begot Italian caff√®. The latter word-form entered most Western languages in the early 17th century. The Western languages of the early 17th century also have numerous records where the word-form was taken directly from the Arabic, e.g. cahoa in 1610, cahue in 1615, cowha in 1619.Book: All About Coffee, by William H. Ukers (year 1922), chapter 1 \\"Dealing with the Etymology of Coffee\\" and chapter 3 \\"Early History of Coffee Drinking\\". According to this book, coffee-drinking as we know it has its earliest reliable record in mid-15th-century Yemen. It arrived in Cairo in the early 16th, and became widespread in the Ottoman Empire during the 16th. It arrived in Western Europe in the early 17th. The earliest European importers were Venetians who used the word caff√® (1615), from Turkish kahve. The predominance of Venetians in the seaborne trade between the Ottoman Empire and the West helped this word (and derivations from it) prevail in the West. Most dictionaries say English coffee (and Dutch koffie) is from the Venetian/Italian but some judge it to be independently from the Turkish. Cafe mocha, a type of coffee, is named after the port city of Mocha, Yemen, which was an early coffee exporter. ;cotton : ŸÇÿ∑ŸÜ qutn  qutun, cotton. This was the usual word for cotton in medieval Arabic. The word entered the Romance languages in the mid-12th century and English a century later. Cotton fabric was known to the ancient Romans as an import but cotton was rare in the Romance-speaking lands until imports from the Arabic-speaking lands in the later medieval era at transformatively lower prices.Book The Italian Cotton Industry in the Later Middle Ages, by Maureen Fennell Mazzaoui (Cambridge University Press 1981), Chapter I: \\"Cotton cultivation in the ancient and medieval world\\" and Chapter II: \\"The Mediterranean cotton trade 1100‚Äì1600\\". ;crimson : ŸÇÿ±ŸÖÿ≤Ÿä qirmizƒ´, color of a class of crimson dye used in the medieval era for dyeing silk and wool.Examples of ŸÇÿ±ŸÖÿ≤ qirmiz and ŸÇÿ±ŸÖÿ≤Ÿä qirmizƒ´ in medieval Arabic writers meaning cochineal crimson dye or a thing dyed with this dye: Texts by Al-Razi (died c. 930), Ibn Duraid (died c. 933), Al- Istakhri (died c. 957) (ŸÇÿ±ŸÖÿ≤ on page 40), Al-Biruni (died 1048), Ibn Sida (died 1066), Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) (ŸÇÿ±ŸÖÿ≤ on page 664). The dye was made from the bodies of certain scale insect species. In Latin in the early- medieval centuries this kind of crimson dye was variously called coccinus, vermiculus, and grana. The Arabic name qirmizƒ´  qirmiz enters the records in the Latin languages in the later-medieval centuries, starting in Italy and initially referring in particular to just one of the dyes of the class, the one called Armenian cochineal today. Italian about year 1300 had carmesi  chermisi  cremesi meaning both the dye itself and the crimson color from the dye. Later in the same century Italian added the suffix -ino, producing cremisino = \\"dyed with cochineal-type crimson dye\\", and synonymously about year 1400 there was French cremosyn, Spanish cremesin, English cremesyn, Latin cremesinus, where -inus is a Latin and Latinate suffix.Early 14th century Italian carmesi  chermisi  cremesi came directly from Arabic qirmizƒ´ in the Eastern Mediterranean in the late 13th and early 14th century. Most early records in Italian explicitly involve the Eastern Mediterranean, including trade with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The word in all other European languages came from Italian. This is demonstrable from the chronological order of the records, and the various wordforms found, and the words' usages. In late medieval usages in Europe there was a close association between the word and the crimson-dyed silk cloths made in Italy. The word appears in several word-forms. The documentation of the word-forms and the dating of when they start to show up in the late medieval Latinate languages is reviewed in detail in English Words Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note 59. English \\"crimson\\" started in the form crimesin then contracted to crimsin and then altered to crimson.Cremesin + crimsin @ Middle English Dictionary, and crimson @ New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. Crossref kermes, one of the scale-insect species. ;curcuma (plant genus), curcumin (yellow dye), curcuminoid (chemicals) : ŸÉÿ±ŸÉŸÖ kurkum, meaning ground turmeric root, also saffron. Turmeric dye gives a saffron yellow colour. Medieval Arabic dictionaries say kurkum is used as a yellow dye and used as a medicine.A number of large dictionaries were written in Arabic during medieval times. Searchable copies of nearly all of the main medieval Arabic dictionaries are online at Baheth.info and/or AlWaraq.net. One of the most esteemed of the dictionaries is Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari's \\"Al-Sihah\\" which is dated around and shortly after year 1000. The biggest is Ibn Manzur's \\"Lisan Al- Arab\\" which is dated 1290 but most of its contents were taken from a variety of earlier sources, including 9th- and 10th-century sources. Often Ibn Manzur names his source then quotes from it. Therefore, if the reader recognizes the name of Ibn Manzur's source, a date considerably earlier than 1290 can often be assigned to what is said. A list giving the year of death of a number of individuals who Ibn Manzur quotes from is in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, volume 1, page xxx (year 1863). Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon contains much of the main contents of the medieval Arabic dictionaries in English translation. At AlWaraq.net, in addition to searchable copies of medieval Arabic dictionaries, there are searchable copies of a large number of medieval Arabic texts on various subjects. Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) said kurkum is (among other things) a root from the East Indies that produces a saffron-like dye. In the West the early records have meaning turmeric and they are in late medieval Latin medical books that were influenced by Arabic medicine.Ibn al-Baitar said ŸÉÿ±ŸÉŸÖ kurkum is a root that is brought from the East Indies and produces a saffron-like yellow dye; he also said kurkum can alternatively mean the yellow root of the Mediterranean plant Chelidonium majus ‚Äì ref, ref. An early record of the word in Latin is in a medical dictionary dated 1292, Synonyma Medicinae by Simon of Genoa, where curcuma is said to be a yellow root that can be used to dye clothes and is said to come from a Chelidonium-type plant ‚Äì ref. A mix- up in meaning between Curcuma root and Chelidonia root was present in the definition of the name \\"curcuma\\" in late medieval Latin. The mix-up was noted in the early-16th-century Latin pharmacy book Antidotarium by Pseudo-Mesu√© ‚Äì ref. In English the early records are in medical books and two examples from at or before 1425 are in the Middle English Dictionary: Example 1, Example 2 The word is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit ku·πÖkuma, referring to both turmeric and saffron, used in India since ancient times for religious ceremonies, pigment dyeing and medicine. D ;damask (textile fabric), damask rose (flower) : ÿØŸÖÿ¥ŸÇ dimashq, city of Damascus. The city name Damascus is very ancient and not Arabic. The damson plum ‚Äì earlier called also the damask plum and damascene plum ‚Äì has a word-history in Latin that goes back to the era when Damascus was part of the Roman empire and so it is not from Arabic. On the other hand, the damask fabric and the damask rose emerged in the Western European languages when Damascus was an Arabic-speaking city; and apparently at emergence they referred to goods originally sold from or made in Arabic Damascus.In French, Italian and Spanish the word for damask is the same as the word for Damascus. In late medieval English the city name Damascus was often written Damask. Some history for the English words \\"damask\\", \\"damask rose\\", \\"damaskeen\\", etc., and \\"damson\\", is in A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1897). The late medieval European \\"damask\\" fabric was a costly decorated fabric which was usually but not necessarily of silk. The fabric-name damask is present in the 14th century in French, English, Catalan, Italian, and Latin, and it seems to be absent earlier than the 14th ‚Äì ref, ref, ref, ref (and ref cf.). The term \\"damask steel\\", \\"damascus steel\\" and \\"damascening (metals)\\" has a 16th-century introduction date and it is a metaphorical extension from the damask textile fabric, notwithstanding that Damascus had a reputation for steel-making with a prior history; \\"Damascus Steel in Legend and in Reality\\" (year 1965). With regard to the textile fabric, the city of Damascus in the later medieval centuries had a reputation for high-quality silk brocades (e.g.: quote from year 1154). In Europe, probably starting in Italian, \\"traders fastened the name of damascen or damask upon every silken fabric richly wrought and curiously designed, no matter whether it came or not from Damascus\\" (1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica). A word for plain silk that is in most of the Arabic medieval dictionaries is dimaqs. The Arabic medieval dictionaries do not have dimashq (Damascus) for any kind of fabric. At least one of them does have dimashq for the damask rose. See ÿØŸÖŸÇÿ≥ and ÿØŸÖÿ¥ŸÇ @ Baheth.info. E ;elixir : ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÉÿ≥Ÿäÿ± al-iksƒ´r, alchemical philosopher's stone, i.e. a pulverized mineral agent by which you could supposedly make gold (also silver) out of copper or other metals. The Arabs took the word from Greek xƒìron, then prepended Arabic al- = \\"the\\". The Greek had entered Arabic meaning a dry powder for treating wounds, and it has a couple of records in medieval Arabic in that sense. Al-Biruni (died 1048) is an example of a medieval Arabic writer who used the word in the alchemy sense, for making gold.An Arabic technical dictionary entitled MafƒÅtƒ´·∏• al- øul≈´m (\\"Keywords of the Sciences\\"), dated 10th century (ref for date), defined al- iksƒ´r as \\"a preparation which, when cooked together with a molten body, turns the molten body into gold or silver or into some other body of white or yellow color\\" ‚Äì ref (in Arabic), ref (in Arabic) . The same word is defined in the same way in the 11th century Book of Precious Stones by Al-Biruni ‚Äì ŸÖŸÉÿ™ÿ®ÿ©- ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ∑ŸÅŸâ.com. More examples of al-iksƒ´r in medieval Arabic are in Ref and Ref. The Arabic alchemy sense entered Latin in the 12th century. Elixir is in all European languages today. ;erg (landform), hamada (landform), sabkha (landform), wadi (landform) : ÿπÿ±ŸÇ  øerq, sandy desert landscape. ÿ≠ŸÖÿßÿØÿ© hamƒÅda, craggy desert landscape with very little sand. Those two words are in use in English in geomorphology and sedimentology. Their entrypoint was in late-19th- century studies of the Sahara Desert.Etymology at: Erg and Hamada (in French). Definition of hamada in a geology dictionary at ref (in English). ÿ≥ÿ®ÿÆÿ© sabkha, salt marsh. This Arabic word occurs occasionally in English and French in the 19th century. Sabkha with a technical meaning as coastal salt- flat terrain came into general use in sedimentology in the 20th century through numerous studies of the coastal salt flats on the eastern side of the Arabian peninsula.An Intro to Sabkhas . Also A Proposed Formal Definition for Sabkha ŸàÿßÿØŸä wƒÅdƒ´, a river valley or gully. In English, a wadi is a non-small gully that is dry, or dry for most of the year, in the desert. F ;fennec (desert fox) : ŸÅŸÜŸÉ fenek, fennec fox. European naturalists borrowed it in the late 18th century. (In older Arabic writings, fenek also designated various other mammalsIn medieval Arabic fenek  fanak could be any mammal species whose pelts were used to make fur coats for humans and most often these were species of the weasel family. CNRTL.fr, Devic, Dozy & Engelmann.). Addendum for words that may or may not be of Arabic ancestry ;caliber, calipers : Excluding an isolated and semantically unclear record in northern France in 1478, the early records are in French in the early and mid 16th century spelled calibre, equally often spelled qualibre, with two concurrent meanings: (1) \\"the interior diameter of a gun-barrel\\" and (2) \\"the quality or comparative character of anything\\". The source-word for the French is uncertain. A popular idea is that it came from Arabic ŸÇÿßŸÑÿ® qƒÅlib = \\"mold\\" but evidence to support this idea is very scant.The idea that Western calibre = \\"gun-barrel size\\" comes etymologically from Arabic qƒÅlib = \\"mold\\" is an old idea which can be found in Gilles M√©nage's Dictionnaire Etymologique year 1694. Most dictionaries still adhere to this idea today and the majority of them say the transmission to the West was through Italian. That has the weakness that the word is not attested in Italian until 1606 whereas it is in French as calibre or qualibre in 1523 (ref: page 73), 1546 (ref), 1547 (ref), 1548 (ref), 1549 (ref), 1550 (ref: page 77), 1552 as qualibr√©e meaning \\"calibrated\\" (ref), 1553 (ref), and a large and growing number of times later in the 16th century in French; and in English in 1567, 1588, 1591 and onward (ref); and in German starting in 1603 (ref). The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology by Robert K. Barnhart says \\"Italian calibro (1606) and Spanish calibre (1594) appear too late to act as intermediate forms between Middle French and Arabic qalib\\", but goes on to say Middle French calibre probably did come from the Arabic somehow. Likewise the Spanish Diccionario RAE and the Catalan Diccionari.cat say their word calibre is from the French which in turn is, or perhaps is, from Arabic qƒÅlib. Evidence is very scant for transmission of Arabic qƒÅlib = \\"mold\\" to French calibre by any route. Hence the New English Dictionary on Historical Principles says the French word is \\"of uncertain origin\\". English Words Of Arabic Etymological Ancestry: Note #168 has many details about the early history of the French word, and argues that the word did not come from Arabic and instead probably came from Latin qua libra = \\"of what weight, of what balance\\". ;carafe : It is fair to say that carafe starts in the European languages in the 14th century in Sicily‚Äîin texts in Latin and Sicilian Italian‚Äîspelled carraba, meaning a glass carafe, a glass vase for holding wine.Arabismi Medievali di Sicilia by Girolamo Caracausi, year 1983 (in Italian), on pages 160-161. Documents the medieval Sicilian carraba = \\"glass carafe\\", which has records in 1330, 1340, 1348, 1373, 1380, 1450, 1455, and 1459. With regard to the origin of the Sicilian carraba, Girolamo Caracausi invokes a Persian word ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ®Ÿá qarƒÅba meaning a carafe-like vessel. But the Persian word is not documented in Arabic, and it would need be in Arabic to be the source for the Sicilian carraba. Another hypothesis is Arabic ŸÇÿ±ÿ®ÿ© qirba = \\"large bottle made of leather\\", well documented in medieval Arabic, which conceivably might have had an oral variant form ŸÇÿ±ÿ®ÿ© qaraba  qiraba, but is semantically somewhat off-target. In 1499 it starts in northern Italian as caraffa meaning a carafe made of glass. The word, as carraba and caraffa, looks unprecedented in terms of Latin or Greek. The most popular origin hypothesis is based upon Arabic ÿ∫ÿ±ŸÅÿ© gharfa, which in medieval Arabic meant a large spoon or ladle to scoop up water. Gharfa is somewhat off-target semantically and phonetically, and does not have much background historical context to support it.GharrƒÅf meaning a carafe or jug is on record in Arabic in the later 19th century ‚Äì ref: Henri Lammens, year 1890. But that Arabic word has to be suspected as borrowed from Europe because there is no known record in Arabic at a sufficiently early date. GharƒÅfa is not documented in Arabic until the 19th century, which is around 500 years after the start of documents for the Sicilian Italian carraba = \\"carafe\\" in 1330, and around 350 years after the start of the northern Italian caraffa in 1499. There is a well-documented medieval Arabic verb ÿ∫ÿ±ŸÅ gharf meaning to scoop up water for a drink, which you can do by cupping your hands together or by using any scooping or lifting tool. The name of the tool has medieval records in Arabic meaning a large spoon or ladle, spelled as a noun gharfa. The meanings of the medieval rootword ÿ∫ÿ±ŸÅ gharaf and words derived from it are given in Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon Volume 6 and the abbreviations used by Lane's Lexicon are expanded and dated in Volume 1, pages xxx - xxxi, year 1863. Additional old records for gharf and words derived from it are in Dozy's Supplement aux Dictionnaires Arabes Volume 2 and abbreviations used by Dozy's Supplement are expanded and dated in Volume 1 pages xvii - xxix, year 1881. The possibility that Arabic gharfa was the source for European \\"carafe\\" is discussed in Dozy's Glossaire, year 1869. ;carrack : This is an old type of large sailing ship. The word's early records in European languages are in the 12th and 13th centuries in the maritime republic of Genoa in Latin spelled carraca  caraca.Lexicon of medieval Ligurian-Latin, Vocabolario Ligure Parte 1, by Sergio Aprosio, year 2001, has 12th & early 13th century Ligurian-Latin carraca  caraca on page 222 (abbreviations defined on page 25). In descent from the Genoa word, it has records in the late 13th century in Catalan and Spanish, and late 14th in French and English.That the carrack sailing-ship name originated in maritime Italy is noted by the Spanish carraca @ Diccionario RAE and the French carraque @ CNRTL.fr. In England one of the earliest known records, year 1383, says in Latin: \\"a certain big ship, called Carrak of Genoa\\" ‚Äì carike @ Middle English Dictionary. Today it is most popularly said that the Italian-Latin name was probably somehow adopted from an Arabic word. There are two different propositions for which medieval Arabic word, namely: (1) ŸÇÿ±ÿßŸÇŸäÿ± qarƒÅqƒ´r = \\"merchant ships\\" (plural of qurq≈´r = \\"merchant ship\\") and (2) ÿ≠ÿ±ŸëÿßŸÇÿ© harrƒÅqa = \\"kind of warship\\". There is also a specific alternative proposition that does not involve an Arabic word. The origin remains uncertain and poorly understood.Classic Ships of Islam, by Dionisius Agius, year 2007, says there is insufficient evidence to reach any conclusion about whether a ship-name in use in medieval Arabic was the parent of the medieval Latinate carraca ship-name. Carrack @ Yule & Burnell (year 1903) mentions three possibilities for the origin of the medieval Latinate carraca and says each is possible. Carrack @ NED says the medieval word is \\"of uncertain origin\\". Another old type of sailing ship with possible, probable or definite Arabic word-origin is the Xebec. Another is the Felucca. Another is the Dhow. ;cork : The earliest records in England are 1303 \\"cork\\" and 1342 \\"cork\\" meaning bulk cork bark imported from Iberia.\\"Cork\\" in the Middle English Dictionary. It is widely reported today that the word came from Spanish alcorques = \\"slipper shoes made of cork\\". This Spanish \\"al-\\" word cannot be found in writing in any medieval Arabic author. Most etymology dictionaries nevertheless state that the Spanish word is almost surely from Arabic because of the \\"al-\\". However, there is evidence in Spanish supporting the contrary argument that the \\"al-\\" in this case was probably solely Spanish and that the corque part of the Spanish word descended from classical Latin without Arabic intermediation (and to repeat, the evidence in Arabic is that there was no such word in Arabic). The ancient Romans used cork and called it, among other names, cortex (literally: \\"bark\\"). From that Latin, medieval and modern Spanish has :es:Corcho = \\"cork material\\". Corcho is definitely not from Arabic. Corcho is the more likely source for the English word, by reason of semantics.Since the English \\"cork\\" meant bulk cork bark from its earliest records (ref: MED), the parent of English \\"cork\\" can have been the medieval Spanish corcho = \\"cork bark\\", and not the medieval Spanish alcorque = \\"slipper shoe made of cork\\". Spanish alcorque never meant \\"cork\\" ‚Äì ref (pages 66-67). Looking at it phonetically there is not much to prefer between CORTCH-O and AL-COR-GAY as a parent for English CORK. The classical Latin cortex (cortic-) = \\"bark of any tree\\" produced today's Spanish corteza = \\"bark of any tree\\" and also produced today's Portuguese corti√ßa = \\"bark of the cork tree exclusively\\", while the classical Latin suber meaning exclusively \\"cork bark\\" produced today's Portuguese s√∫ber = \\"bark of any tree\\". Spanish pancho is from Latin pantex, Spanish ocho and dicho from Latin octo and dictus, Spanish percha from Latin pertica, Spanish capacho from Latin capax, Spanish mucho from Latin multus, all without Arabic intermediation, and corcho is adjudged to be similarly evolved from cortex by Dozy, Diez, Corominas, DRAE, and other Spanish experts. The Spanish almadre√±a = \\"wooden clog shoes\\" has no precedent in Arabic writings, and instead it is purely Spanish madre√±a  madere√±a, from Spanish madera = \\"wood\\", from a classical Latin word for wood, with \\"al-\\" prefixed in Spanish alone ‚Äì Dozy and Engelmann page 372. The same may be the case with Spanish alcorques = \\"cork slipper shoes\\" in view of its absence in medieval Arabic writers. An Arabic‚ÄìLatin dictionary written in Spain by an anonymous native Spanish speaker during the late 13th century (estimated date) contains an Arabic ŸÇÿ±ŸÇ qorq translated as Latin sotular (English \\"shoe\\") ‚Äì Vocabulista in Arabico. But the medieval writings by native-Arabic-speakers have huge numbers of records for shoes, sandals, slippers and boots, and have no qorq shoe. An Etymological Dictionary of the Romance Languages, by Freidrich Diez, year 1864, has the minority view that alcorque derives from the classical Latin cortex by a Spanish-only path on which the letter 't' was deleted. In Catalan the usual word for \\"bark of any tree\\" is escor√ßa, which comes with deletion of 't' from the classical Latin cortex and/or classical Latin scortea = \\"tough outer skin, or leather\\". After 't' is deleted, comparable evolutions would include today's Spanish pliegue from classical Latin plex, Spanish pulga from classical Latin pulex, Spanish estoraque from Latin storax, Spanish bosque from Latin boscus. ;drub : Probably from ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ® ·∏çarb, striking or hitting with a cudgel. The word is not in European languages other than English. The English word drub \\"appears first after 1600; all the early instances, before 1663, are from travellers in the Orient, and refer to the bastinado. Hence, in the absence of any other tenable suggestion, it may be conjectured to represent Arabic ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ® daraba (also pronounced duruba), to beat, to bastinado, and the verbal noun darb (also pronounced durb).\\"\\"Drub\\" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1897). ;fanfare, fanfaronade : English fanfare is from French fanfare, which is probably from Spanish fanfarria and fanfarr√≥n and fanfarronear, meaning bluster, grandstanding, and a talker who is full of bravado. Spanish records also have the lesser-used variant forms farfant√≥n  farfante with pretty much the same meaning as fanfarr√≥n. The origin of the Spanish words is obscure and uncertain. An origin in the Arabic of medieval Spain is possible. One Arabic candidate is ŸÅÿ±ŸÅÿ± farfar  ŸÅÿ±ŸÅÿßÿ± farfƒÅr  ŸÅÿ±ŸÅÿ±ÿ© farfara which is in the medieval Arabic dictionaries with meanings including \\"lightness and frivolity\\", \\"talkative\\", and \\"shouting\\".The medieval Arabic dictionaries' definitions of farfƒÅr  farfara are at ŸÅÿ±ŸÅÿ±  ŸÅÿ±ŸÅÿßÿ± @ Baheth.info and Lane's Lexicon page 2357. This proposed Arabic source-word for the Spanish fanfarria and fanfarr√≥n was reported by Gilles M√©nage in his Dictionnaire Etymologique back in year 1670 ‚Äì ref. Today it is contemplated but not fully endorsed at fanfarr√≥n @ RAE.es, farfante @ RAE.es, fanfaron @ CNRTL.fr, fanfaronade @ American Heritage Dictionary and fanfare @ Etymonline.com.

Michigan Julian carrying the ball, 1959 Julian attended the University of Michigan played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1957 to 1959. As a junior, Julian started all nine games at right halfback on both offense and defense for the 1958 Michigan Wolverines football team. The 1958 team finished in eighth place in the Big Ten Conference with a disappointing 2-6-1 record. Julian rushed for 180 yards on 45 carries in 1958. Michigan head coach Bennie Oosterbaan was fired after the 1958 season and replaced with Bump Elliott. Under the new head coach, the 1959 Wolverines improved marginally to 7th place in the Big Ten and a 4-5 record. Julian was the starting right halfback in seven of Michigan's nine games in 1959, rushing for 289 yards on 72 carries. On October 24, 1959, he gained a career-high 93 yards, including a 42-yard touchdown run, in a 14-6 victory over Minnesota. He also scored the winning touchdown on a one-yard run in a 20-15 upset victory over Illinois on November 7, 1959. Julian was Michigan's leading rusher in 1959, and his total of 289 yards remains the lowest in school history for a player who led the team in rushing.Ryczek, p. 63. Professional football Julian was not drafted in the 1960 NFL Draft. Michigan head coach Bump Elliott arranged for Julian to get a tryout with the New York Titans (renamed the Jets in 1963) in the newly formed American Football League. He tried out for the team at the Polo Grounds on July 7, 1960, and the Titans' head coach Sammy Baugh was reportedly impressed by Julian's \\"ability at one-to-one coverage.\\"Ryczek 2009, p. 63. Julian made the team and played appeared in all 14 games as a defensive back in the Titans' inaugural season. He led the team (and finished fourth in the league) with six pass interceptions. After a 27-7 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, Titans general manager Steve Sebo singled out Julian as \\"the best defensive back on the field.\\"Ryczek 2009, p. 91. Julian later recalled that he learned a tremendous amount about football from watching and listening to Sammy Baugh.Rycaek 2009, p. 41. Prior to training camp in 1961, Julian learned he was likely to be drafted by the military. According to William Ryczek's history of the New York Jets, Julian was a starter for the Titans in all of their pre-season games, but the team released him before the start of the regular season due to his imminent induction into the military. He tried out with the Boston Patriots but was rejected for the same reason. In the end, Julian was not drafted in the military. He returned to Michigan where he coached high school football and played in the newly formed World Football League for the team in Grand Rapids.Ryczek 2009, p. 282. Coaching career After retiring as a football player, Julian worked in Detroit as an insurance agent during the 1960s. In 1969, Julian returned to Grand Rapids and became the head football coach at West Catholic High School. He was the head football coach at West Catholic for 16 years. In 1985, he took over as the head football coach at Grand Rapids Community College (GRCC), succeeding Gordon Hunsberger, who had been the head coach since the 1950s. He remained as the coach at GRCC for 18 years from 1985 to 2002, compiling a record of 139-48-2. He led GRCC to the 1988 national championship game and appearances in seven bowl games, including the 1986 Texas Junior College Shrine Bowl, 1987 East Bowl, the 1988 Valley of the Sun Bowl (National Championship Game), the 1990 Mickinnon Travel Midwest Bowl, the 1992 Dixie Rotary Bowl, the 1996 Dixie Rotary Bowl, and the 2002 Graphic Edge/Siglar Printing Bowl. Julian retired after the 2002 season In 2003, he was inducted into the National Junior College Athletic Association Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Family Julian was married to Joycelin A.

This riot occurred on July 24, 1967 in Cambridge, Maryland, a county seat on the Eastern Shore. For years racial tension had been high in Cambridge, where black people had been limited to second-class status. Activists had conducted protests since 1961, and there was a riot in June 1963 after the governor imposed martial law. \\"The Treaty of Cambridge\\" was negotiated among federal, state, and local leaders in July 1963, initiating integration in the city prior to passage of federal civil rights laws. The events of 1967 were much more destructive to the city. After a fiery speech was given by H. Rap Brown on the evening of July 24, black residents began to confront police while trying to have a protest march. Brown was wounded by buckshot to the face. He was rushed out of Cambridge by supporters, and about an hour later, riots broke out in the black community. An elementary school was set on fire and, after the fire department did not respond, the fire spread and destroyed seventeen other buildings on Pine Street. Governor Spiro Agnew sought to have Brown charged with inciting a riot. The FBI helped track down the activist, who was arrested within two days.  History of riots  The Cambridge riot of 1967 was an expression of frustration and anger by black people living in Cambridge, who had been oppressed by state racial laws and custom. This had been a rural area of plantations. In the mid-20th century, many black people worked in low-level jobs in the growing poultry industry in the area but still suffered low wages and unemployment. Overt segregation in schools and public facilities had largely ended after the June 1963 riot and \\"Treaty of Cambridge\\", but black people still suffered from economic inequality. In 1961, the Freedom Riders came to Cambridge, part of an effort to desegregate seating and facilities for interstate buses. Many participants were students from regional colleges, such as Howard University in Washington, DC. Some also were members of such civil rights organizations as SNCC or CORE. The black community in Cambridge conducted sit-ins through 1962 and 1963, protesting segregated facilities. In June 1963 martial law was imposed and the National Guard was ordered into the city. A protest on June 11 resulted in shots being exchanged after whites attacked black protesters marching to the Dorchester County Courthouse before curfew. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy called a meeting in Washington, DC of both black and white leaders from Cambridge, hoping to negotiate an agreement that would allow progress and end the protests. Including Gloria Richardson, leader of the Cambridge Movement, they signed \\"The Treaty of Cambridge\\", adding an equal rights amendment to the city's charter, among other commitments. During 1963 the city desegregated its schools, library and hospital, and other public facilities. Black activists pressed for economic development in the county and other actions to enable black people to improve their economic position. In 1964 they joined a voter registration and voting drive to elect a state representative to move for economic progress in the county. In late 1964, Richardson left Cambridge and moved to New York, where she married photographer Frank Dandridge, whom she had met when he was covering the protests in her town. In New York she met Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, better known as H. Rap Brown, a black activist who supported violent resistance. He said, \\"Only through force could African-Americans win their rights\\". Civil unrest occurred in many cities during the summer of 1967. Although important civil rights legislation had been passed in 1964 and 1965, African Americans struggled locally with economics. H. Rap Brown was among the activists who went to Cambridge, where the local black community continued to press for improved conditions and opportunity. On the evening of July 24, 1967, a crowd of 20 to 30 black Cambridge citizens began marching toward Race Street, where a group of police officers met them and prevented their continuing. After telling the group to stop, Deputy Sheriff Wesley Burton shot twice with his shotgun without warning. One shot ricocheted off the ground, hitting H. Rap Brown in the head. Because of this, Brown was moved out of Cambridge. The adjutant general of Maryland said that Brown must have gotten hit later, during the full-fledged riot that broke out, but it did not start until after protesters learned that he had been wounded. Earlier in the evening Brown stood on top of a car in the city and said, ‚ÄúIf Cambridge doesn't come around, Cambridge got to be burned down.‚Äù  Aftermath  An hour after learning that Brown had been shot, black residents began to riot, and police officers and African Americans exchanged gunfire on the streets of Cambridge. A black elementary school on Pine Street, the social center of Dorchester Street's black community, was burned down during the riot. It was considered a severe loss to the community.https://search.proquest.com/docview/1864997590 The all-white fire department did not respond to the fire. Reportedly they said, if the blacks had started it, they should finish it. Reportedly many black residents tried to put the fire out with buckets of water, but the fire was much too big. All of the structures on Pine Street burned, a total of 17 buildings destroyed. After these events, Governor Spiro Agnew attributed the damages to H. Rap Brown, because of his inflammatory speech. After inspecting the ruins of Pine Street, Governor Agnew said, ‚ÄúIt shall now be the policy of the state to arrest any person inciting to riot, and to not allow that person to finish his vicious speech‚Äù. Agnew's response to the Cambridge riots are considered to have gained support among some whites for his political career. He was elected as vice president in 1968 on the Republican ticket with Richard Nixon as president. He was later forced to resign because of corruption charges. Accounts of the riots and conditions varied. City officials said that Cambridge did not have a black ghetto, that its schools were among the finest in the nation (they had been segregated for decades), and that relationships among black and white residents was ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù. Reflecting fears of the time, especially by top-ranking FBI officials, the mainstream media reported ties between Black Power and communism. In response, the Black Action Federation conducted polls among residents where the rioting took place. They found that black residents of Cambridge said that white racism and inequality were the underlying cause of the riots. It was not well-reported. Many people of Cambridge, and the mayor of Baltimore, Thomas D'Alesandro III, mayor of Baltimore, alleged that the riots had been planned in advance. Black people said the events were a response to inequality. Police officers and white leaders called it a riot, attributing it to some organization. Two days later Brown was arrested and charged with inciting the riot. The government used him to set an example and instill fear into the social action movement so that it would not spread. There were conflicting stories between state officials and black activists as to what had actually occurred. Based on the reports from officials, public media thought that Brown was guilty and that his speech was a catalyst for the riot. Officials tried to make an example out of Brown, and evade their own responsibility for events. As noted, Governor Agnew was outraged about the riot. He had earlier had a positive reputation in the black community, but they resisted him later, after his actions following Cambridge events. He referred to Brown as a ‚Äúprofessional agitator.‚Äù Agnew became increasingly critical of black civil rights leaders for what he said was their ‚Äúfailure‚Äù to stop rioting. In April 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in Memphis, Tennessee, Agnew invited fifty black Civil Rights leaders of Maryland to a conference. But there he essentially blamed black individuals for the rioting and looting in many cities that followed the murder of King.\\"STATEMENT AT CONFERENCE WITH CIVIL RIGHTS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS, STATE OFFICE BUILDING, BALTIMORE, April 11, 1968\\", Executive Records, Governor Spiro T.

The conflict lasted between 1950 and 1959 and was ended by a cross-party agreement, known as the School Pact, which clarified the role of religion in the state. It followed a crisis over the same issue in the 19th century, known as the First School War. Crisis After victory in the 1950 elections, a Christian Social Party (PSC-CVP) majority government came to power in Belgium for the first time since the end of World War II. The new education minister, Pierre Harmel, used the PSC-CVP's position to increase the wages paid to teachers in private (mainly Roman Catholic) schools and introduced laws linking the subsidies for private schools to the number of pupils. These measures were perceived by the traditionally-anticlerical Liberals and Socialists as a \\"declaration of war\\" on the traditionally contentious issue of religion in education. The 1954 elections reversed the PSC-CVP victory and brought to power a coalition of Socialists and Liberals under Achille Van Acker. The new Education Minister, Leo Collard, immediately set out to reverse the measures taken by Harmel, founding a large number of secular schools and only permitting the instatement of teachers with a diploma, which forced many unqualified priests out of the profession. These measures sparked mass protests from the Catholic bloc. A compromise was eventually reached by the following government (a Catholic minority led by Gaston Eyskens) and the War was concluded by an agreement, known as the School Pact, on 6 November 1958. School Pact The School War was finally ended by the \\"School Pact\\" (Pacte scolaire or Schoolpact). Under the agreement, parents could choose the system they preferred for their children. Publicly, the pact did not satisfy anyone and many in the Catholic camp, especially the Belgian Cardinal van Roey.

On 7 December 2012, she was found dead by suicide, three days after falling for a prank phone call as part of a radio stunt. In the prank call, the hosts of the Australian radio programme Hot30 Countdown, broadcast on the Southern-Cross- Austereo-owned station 2Day FM in Sydney, called Saldanha's hospital and impersonated the Queen and the Prince of Wales enquiring about the health of the Duchess of Cambridge, who was a patient there at the time. Saldanha fell for the hoax and transferred the call to the nurse looking after the Duchess. Saldanha's suicide led to public outrage, including in Saldanha's home country against those responsible for perpetrating and broadcasting the prank. Despite numerous calls for legal action, no charges were laid. Background of Saldanha Saldanha was 46 years old at the time of her death. She was born in Mangalore, India, and had lived in Oman for several years, before moving to England around 2002. In December 2012, she was staying in nurse's quarters at her London workplace, for the sake of convenience, while her family (her husband, her 16-year-old son and her 14-year-old daughter) lived in Bristol. The family initially reported to the press that Saldanha did not have any history of mental illness or depression. However, multiple news sources later revealed that this was not Saldanha's first attempt at suicide, noting she had attempted suicide on two previous occasions and was taking anti-depressant medication. Prank call Buildings of the King Edward VII's Hospital in Devonshire Street, London On 2 December 2012, St James's Palace announced that Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was pregnant. On 4 December, at about 5:30 am London time (GMT) or 4:30 pm Sydney time (AEST), the hosts of the Hot30 Countdown radio programme, Mel Greig and Mike Christian, called the hospital and spoke to Saldanha. Impersonating Elizabeth II, Greig said: \\"Oh hello there, could I please speak to Kate please, my granddaughter.\\" Saldanha responded, \\"Oh yes. Hold on ma'am,\\" and transferred the call to the Duchess's nurse, who spent approximately two minutes speaking with Greig as well as Christian, the latter impersonating The Prince of Wales. The hosts used what were later described as \\"ridiculous comedy accents.\\" The stunt was broadcast on 5 December, after it had been cleared by the radio station's lawyers. When hospital chief executive John Lofthouse learned of the prank call, he condemned it as an act of \\"journalistic trickery\\" that no nurse should have to deal with. The CEO of Southern Cross Austereo, Rhys Holleran, later claimed that station officials had made at least five attempts to contact the two nurses in the recording prior to greenlighting the call for broadcast ‚Äì with Sydney University law professor, Barbara McDonald noting that his comments showed the station already understood they needed to \\"[get] consent (to air the interview) and they failed to\\". On 6 December, the radio station issued a brief apology for \\"any inconvenience caused\\" by their actions, although Christian continued to promote \\"the royal prank\\" on Twitter. Neither Saldanha nor the other nurse was disciplined or suspended by the hospital; St. James's Palace also indicated that they did not blame the nurses for their part in the incident. Death On the morning of 7 December 2012, Saldanha was found dead by security and other staff in her nurse's quarters at the hospital. She had died by hanging, and also had injuries to her wrist. It was reported that Saldanha had left three handwritten notes, one of which blamed the radio stunt for her death. Another note discussed her wishes for funeral arrangements, while the third was directed at her employer, criticising their handling of events that followed the prank call. Southern Cross Austereo Following news of Saldanha's suicide, Austereo CEO Rhys Holleran said that Greig and Christian were both \\"deeply shocked\\" and would not return to their radio show until further notice. A day later, as advertisers boycotted or threatened to boycott the station, 2Day FM suspended all advertising indefinitely. On 10 December, Greig and Christian gave their first interviews since Saldanha's death, telling Nine Network's A Current Affair and Seven Network's Today Tonight that they were still badly shaken over the tragedy.'Shattered' DJs discuss prank call tragedy.

Advertising on 2Day FM resumed 13 December, with Austereo announcing that it would donate the remainder of station advertising proceeds for 2012‚Äîa minimum of A$500,000 (¬£320,000)‚Äîto a memorial fund to benefit Saldanha's family.Kate hoax: Radio station to donate to nurse family.

Christian returned to work in February and won Austereo's \\"Top Jock\\" award in June 2013 for his work on Fox FM in Melbourne, while Greig remained off-air. Greig later sued Austereo for failure to provide a safe workplace; the lawsuit was settled in December 2013. As part of the settlement, Austereo made a public statement that Greig was not responsible for the decision to air the hoax call and had suggested that it be edited before broadcast. Greig found work in advertising after leaving Austereo, but in 2016 returned to radio work in Wollongong, south of Sydney. In March 2018, Greig revealed that she became the target of online bullies following the prank and became a contributor for anti-bullying campaigns. In India The burial function for Saldanha was held on 17 December 2012 in the town of Shirva in Karnataka, India. More than 1,000 people attended the mass and burial ceremony, including a minister of Karnataka state, a former Central Minister and other state functionaries. Several Karnataka dignitaries also visited Saldanha's mother, who lives in Mangalore with Saldanha's siblings. Dozens of students staged a demonstration in front of the British High Commission in New Delhi, carrying banners demanding \\"Justice for Jacintha\\". The Chief Minister of Karnataka expressed concern over the back-to- back deaths of Saldanha and Savita Halappanavar, both women of Karnataka origin working abroad, and wrote letters to the Indian prime minister urging him to take steps to ensure the safety of Indian citizens abroad. RJ Balaji, based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, discontinued his radio show Cross Talk ‚Äì where he made prank calls to unsuspecting victims ‚Äì in response to Saldanha's death. Legal action As part of their investigation into the death, the Metropolitan Police Service in London contacted the New South Wales Police Force in Sydney. However, on 28 December 2012, the New South Wales deputy police commissioner said that there had been no formal request from UK police to interview Greig and Christian, and that it seemed \\"unlikely any charges will be laid.\\" British prosecutors confirmed in February 2013 that they would not be pressing charges against the presenters; although Greig and Christian may have committed offences under Britain's Data Protection Act 1998 and Malicious Communications Act 1988, prosecution was deemed to \\"not be in the public interest\\" because it would not be possible to extradite the Australians and because \\"however misguided, the telephone call was intended as a harmless prank\\". On 13 December 2012, Australian media watchdog Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) launched an inquiry to assess whether the radio station had breached the conditions of their broadcasting licence. In September 2013, it was reported that ACMA had prepared a confidential preliminary report that found 2Day FM had acted illegally by broadcasting the hoax phone call without consent. Southern Cross Austereo was seeking to block the report's release, arguing that ACMA did not have standing to make a criminal finding. A Federal Court judge sided with ACMA in November 2013, but was reversed by a decision of the full bench of the Federal Court in March 2014. ACMA subsequently appealed to the High Court, which agreed in August 2014 to hear the case. On 4 March 2015 the High Court upheld the earlier decision of the ACMA, ruling that the radio station behind the royal hoax call broke the law. In its report, which was released 22 April 2015, ACMA found that 2Day FM had breached the Australian commercial radio code of conduct by broadcasting a statement of an identifiable person without her consent and that they had treated her in a highly demeaning or highly exploitative manner. ACMA applied a third licence condition to 2Day FM as a sanction which consisted of staff ethics training and a three hour broadcast raising awareness of bullying, depression and anxiety .

Born in Luton, England on 24 August 1990, Edwards spent his early years there before moving to Acton, West London where he lived with his mother Brenda, stepfather Patrick and younger sister, Tanisha. In 2019 Edwards set up Jamal Edwards Delve, a project aimed at refurbishing and reopening youth centres.  Early life  As a child he was introduced to stage school by his mother Brenda Edwards, who placed fourth in the second series of The X Factor. His mother wanted him to pursue acting and drama, however he aspired to be successful in the music industry. He attended Acton High School and enjoyed subjects ICT and music. However, he struggled to attain the grades he needed for college, and as a result, had to study for an extra year. He then attended Ealing College where he received a BTEC Diploma in Media Moving Image. During his school years, he started rapping and would film videos with his friends that would then be posted on YouTube. These videos would eventually become his business and the beginning of SBTV. Edwards worked the retail chain Topman for 4 years whilst he ran SBTV in order to financially support himself.

He began to film friends on his estate, rapping and performing and would upload them to his YouTube channel. From there, he created the channel SBTV and uploaded all subsequent videos there. Edwards' rap name at the time was 'SmokeyBarz' which owes to the acronym SB in the channels title. After he left school, he worked at clothing company, Topman whilst continuing to make videos for his channel. His videos began to increase in popularity with the views in the hundred- thousands. As this happened, he was able to quit Topman and solely focus on SBTV.

Edwards started to film artists ahead of their emergence to mainstream markets, such as filming Jessie J's first acoustic video outside of her personal YouTube channel. Edwards soon developed a reputation for capturing music artists before they gained widespread popularity such as Stormzy, Ed Sheeran, Dave, Emeli Sand√©, Rita Ora, Krept & Konan, Yungen, Mic Righteous, Nines, Tori Kelly, Bugzy Malone, Mist, English Frank, Aaron Unknown and Cadet. SB.TV filmed the first online interviews for notable US talent including Bruno Mars, Trey Songz, Janelle Mon√°e and Tyler, the Creator. In 2011, SBTV was featured in a Google Chrome advert.

He was the son of Edwin of Tegeingl. He sided with the Normans in their failed invasion of North Wales, and in the 1090s attempted to become ruler of Gwynedd. His arms were gules three men's legs conjoined at the thighs in triangle argent. Ancestry Little is known of Owain's father, Edwin of Tegeingl.Wilcott, Darrell \\"The Ancestry of Edwin of Tegeingl\\" However, most medieval pedigrees identify Owain's paternal grandfather as Gronwy, a descendant of Hywel Dda. Owain may have been a great-great-great-grandson of Hywel Dda although this is disputed. His paternal grandmother is believed to have been Ethelfleda or Aldgyth, daughter of Eadwine of Mercia. His mother was Iwerydd, sister of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, Prince of Gwynedd and Powys (1063‚Äì1075). 220px Biography Lordship of Tegeingl Owain was Lord or Prince of the cantref of Tegeingl. The cantref formed the eastern part of Perfeddwlad (or Y Berfeddwlad) on the northern coast of Wales between the River Clwyd and Deeside. The territory, originally forming part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, had been under the control of the Anglo-Saxons for several centuries and then changed hands several times between the two. Owain's father, Edwin, appears to have been raised to the lordship of Tegeingl by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, ruler of most of Wales between 1055 and 1063. Edwin died in 1073 and Owain succeeded him as lord. Challenge to the kingship It appears that Owain made a challenge for the kingship of Gwynedd and may have succeeded in holding it for a time in the 1090s. Links to previous rulers through the female line were very important in establishing a claim, and Owain's relationship with Bleddyn ap Cynfyn through his mother would have been relevant. Role in the Norman Invasion In the 1080s and the 1090s, the Normans led by Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester made several attempts to invade and gain control of North Wales. Owain ap Edwin transferred his allegiance to the Normans following the defeat of his ally Trahaearn ap Caradog, prince of Gwynedd (1075‚Äì1081), at the Battle of Mynydd Carn in 1081, a move which earned him the epithet Fradwr, traitor, among the Welsh. In 1098, Owain participated in a massive invasion of North Wales by Hugh d‚ÄôAvranches, with Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, forcing Gruffydd ap Cynan, prince of Gwynedd (1081‚Äì1137), to retreat to Anglesey. As a result of the intervention of a Norwegian army under Magnus Barelegs, the Normans suffered a defeat and withdrew most of their forces to England. Following the Norman withdrawal, Owain was left in command of a token force to control upper Gwynedd. Over the next three years, Gruffydd ap Cynan reasserted his control over Gwynedd and agreed terms with the Normans. In the meantime, Owain deserted the Normans and led a rebellion himself. He died shortly afterwards in 1105, apparently of consumption.Yorke, Philip & al. The royal tribes of Wales. Accessed 4 Feb 2013. Descendants Owain Fradwr married Morfudd, daughter of Goronwy, son of Ednowain Bendew. Owain's daughter, Angharad, married Gruffudd ap Cynan, Prince of Gwynedd, by whom she had three sons: Cadwallon, Owain Gwynedd (the first Welsh prince to take the title Princeps Wallensium,Davies, John A History of Wales, the title Princeps Wallensium Prince of the Welsh) and Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd. His sons were Goronwy, Meilir, Llywelyn, Aldud, and Rhirid. Goronwy was the father of the Cristin who was the second wife of Owain Gwynedd. However, in 1125 a son of Gruffudd ap Cynan killed all Owain's male heirs bringing the direct line of the family to an end.

The First School War (, ) was a political crisis in Belgium over the issue of religion in education. The School War marks the high water mark of the conflict between the conservative Catholic Party, and the secular Liberal Party. The war lasted from 1879 to 1884 and resulted in a period of nearly fifty years of Catholic political dominance. It was followed by a Second School War between 1950 and 1959. Background In the preceding centuries, education in Belgium had been dominated by the Catholic Church. In 1842, a new education law formalized religious education in primary schools, while also conceding the freedom of education guaranteed in Article 17 of the Constitution of 1831: Under the terms of Article 6 of the Education Act of 1842: In practice, the interpretation of the law varied and, since the vast majority of the Belgian population was Catholic, the Church was allowed considerable influence in schools. The quality and spread of education remained poor and, though declining from 51 percent in 1843, 39 percent of the population were still illiterate by 1880. Crisis On 1 June 1879, a Liberal majority under Walth√®re Fr√®re-Orban succeeded in passing an Education Act secularizing primary education. Fr√®re-Orban, who was well known for his anti-clerical beliefs, was nicknamed the \\"Papist Biter\\" (Papenvreter). New \\"neutral\\" schools were to be established in all municipalities, funded by the local communes with assistance from national government, while Catholic schools were to receive no support at all. The Church encouraged a boycott of the new schools. By 1883, although 3,885 secular schools had opened across the country, attendance in private Catholic schools had actually risen from 13 percent to over 60 percent. After fresh elections in 1884, a Catholic government under Jules Malou passed a new Education Law providing public support for religious schools and, in 1895, religious education became compulsory in all schools. Legacy The resistance to the Liberal anti-Catholic legislation revitalised the Catholic Party and led to its re-election under Malou in 1884 and marked the start of a period of nearly unbroken government by the Catholic Party until 1917. Disputes over religion in education continued, extending to university education, where secular universities like the Free University of Brussels competed with Catholic universities like the Catholic University of Leuven. In an 1881 encyclical to Belgium, Licet Multa, issued before the resolution of the crisis, Pope Leo XIII praised the opposition of Catholics to the education act: \\"It is pleasant for us to give special praise to your solicitude in encouraging by all the means possible a good education for the young, and in insuring to the children of the primary schools a religious education established on broad foundations.\\" Rerum novarum issued in 1891 encouraged Catholics to embrace the Church's social mission and to increase its engagement in activities such as education, welfare, and trades unionism that affected the working class. In 1914, primary education (between the age of six and 14) was declared compulsory and free, and, by then, the level of illiteracy had fallen to eight percent.

Five English ships, HMS Henry, HMS Ruby, HMS Antelope, HMS Greyhound and HMS Bryan, appeared at six in the morning in the Bay of M√°laga, without that the Marquis of Mond√©jar, governor of the city, raised the alarm. At 13:00 the English frigates approached the harbor and attacked a Genoese and a Sicilian galley. The Sicilian galley succeeded in escaping at the cost of 2 killed and the captain being wounded. The Genoese galley was less lucky: it was seized and set on fire, together with all other ships found in the harbor. After this, the English started shelling the city and its defenses during 4 hours, seriously damaging M√°laga Cathedral. Meeting little resistance, the English went ashore and destroyed the greater part of the city's munition supply. All the harbor guns were spiked as well. There were at least 14 killed and many wounded in the city. A large part of the population fled to the countryside.

The same year stated maximum output was increased which meant a name change to Benz 10/30 PS. The model disappeared for three years following the First World War but returned in 1921. A further power increase in 1926 meant another name change, now to Benz 10/35 PS.Oswald, p 51 Following the \\"fusion\\" between the Daimler and Benz companies, production of the Benz 10/35 PS ended in 1927.  Naming conventions  The manufacturer applied the widely followed German naming conventions of the time. On the Benz 10/30 PS the ‚Äú10‚Äù defined the car's tax horsepower, used by the authorities to determine the level of annual car tax to be imposed on car owners. The ‚Äú30‚Äù defined the manufacturer's claims regarding car's actual power output as defined in metric horsepower. In Germany tax horsepower, which had been defined by statute since 1906, was based on the dimensions of the cylinders in the engine. Unlike the systems used elsewhere in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account both of the cylinder bore and of the cylinder stroke, and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower. Although the car would have been promoted in its time as the 10/25 PS, the 10/30 PS or the 10/35 PS according to its actual power output at the time, in retrospect it is often known simply as the Benz 10 PS in order to avoid having to explain name changes during the model's production period.  The car  The car presented in 1912 was powered by a four-cylinder \\"in-line\\" engine of 2,610 cc delivering a maximum of at 1,600 rpm. Power passed through a leather cone clutch (‚ÄúLederkonuskupplung‚Äú) via a four-speed transmission and steel propeller shaft to the rear wheels. Top speed was given as approximately 70 km/h (45 mph). In the same year the manufacturer announced a more powerful engine, unchanged in size, but now providing of power at 1,750 rpm.Oswald, p 51 Unusually at this time the four cylinders were in a single block formed from a single casting, rather than being set in a pair of two twin-cylinder blocks. The mechanically controlled brakes operated on the drive shaft until 1925 when the braking system was reconfigured and the brakes operated on all four wheels. The bodies normally offered were for a Torpedo bodied ‚ÄúTourenwagen‚Äù or a ‚ÄùLimousine‚Äù (sedan/saloon).Oswald, p 51 In parallel with the standard length chassis the manufacturer also offered a ‚ÄúSport Runabout‚Äù, its wheelbase being reduced in length by . The wooden-spoked wheels were attached to rigid axles suspended with simple leaf springs. Towards the end, some of the cars were produced with steel-spoked wheels.Oswald, p 51  Impact of War  During the First World War the 10/30 PS continued to be produced but in reduced numbers. Demand during this time was stronger for the Benz 14/30 PS which produced the same advertised level of maximum power as the 10/30 PS but from a larger 3,560 cc engine. Despite the power levels being the same, the military believed that the larger-engined car was likely to be more robust. In the chaotic situation that hit Germany after the war, production of the 10/30 PS came to an end in 1918, but this turned out to be a temporary cessation and the manufacturer resumed production of the 10/35 PS in 1921. Unfortunately precise records covering this period were lost in the Second World War.  1920s upgrades  Benz sales literature from 1921 shows a return of the 10/30 PS with a water-cooled engine the same size as before, but thermosyphon cooling had now replaced the earlier pump based cooling system. Claimed maximum output remained at but this was now achieved at the higher engine speed of 2,000 rpm. The position of the gear lever moved in 1923 from the outside of the car on the right side to what would subsequently become a more conventional position in the middle of the floor.Oswald, p 51 (The driver of a Benz 10/30 PS sat on the right side of the car, which at this time was still virtually universal in Europe.) From 1925 the brakes were rearranged, now operating on all four wheels rather than directly on the drive shaft. In 1926 claimed maximum power from the 2,610 cc engine was increased to at which necessarily triggered a name change, cars from this period being sold as the Benz 10/35 PS. By now a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) was being quoted.Oswald, p 51  The end  Benz & Cie became financially badly overextended in the mid-1920s following the involvement of stock market speculator Jacob Schapiro who at one stage held 60% of the company's share capital,.Oswald, p 50 Most of Schapiro's share holdings ended up in the hands of Deutsche Bank, and it was determined that it would be necessary to merge the Benz business with Daimler of Stuttgart which for reasons of its own was itself in a delicate condition financially. Some sort of a merger between the two businesses had been under discussion at least since 1919 and an agreement between them was signed in 1924 and came into force in the middle of 1926. Future models would be developed by the merged Daimler-Benz AG business and the product development activities of the merged company were initially headed up by Ferdinand Porsche who came from the Daimler side of the business. The Benz 10/35 PS continued in production until 1927. By this time the Mercedes-Benz W 02, effectively the replacement for the Benz 10/35 PS, had been launched (at the Berlin Motor Show in October 1926) and was in production.

Founded in 1929, the company is based in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and also produces an assortment of sauces and mustards. The company was incorporated in 1949 as Silver Spring Gardens. History In 1929, Ellis Huntsinger started growing horseradish and other crops in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. In the early days, he prepared and bottled horseradish by hand. In 1941, Huntsinger discovered that the addition of dairy cream helped further enhance the flavor, heat, and longevity of prepared horseradish. This discovery helped him expand his horseradish sales to markets throughout the United States. The company has been family-owned since it began. It is currently owned by Ellis Huntsinger‚Äôs granddaughter, Nancy Bartusch and her two sons. In 1972, president Edwin Bartusch and his wife, Betty, died in a plane crash. Barbara, the younger of their two daughters, and her husband also died in the crash, leaving the couple‚Äôs 22-year-old daughter Nancy to run the company. She enlisted the help of family friend Bill Nelson Sr., who resigned from Kraft Foods to run the company. His son Bill Nelson Jr. took over a few years later and ran the company for 25 years. Around 2000, the company started producing specialty mustards with horseradish as a key ingredient. In 2003, the company lost a major client, and 30 percent of its business. By 2006, it had gained back enough market share to be completing a new, highly automated 100,000 square foot plant that doubled its production capacity In anticipation of that, in October 2005 the company bought the Waldorf, Nuevo Sol and Bella Migliore brands of jams and sauces, and in January 2006, it completed the purchase of Thor-Shackel Horseradish Co., the producer of Thor's Hot Horseradish and several other brands. In 2009, the company purchased Kelchner's Horseradish Products of Dublin, Pennsylvania. In 2010 the company moved Kelchner's production to a plant in Wisconsin, keeping open Kelchner's headquarters and a shipping operation in Pennsylvania. In 2011, the company began expanding the area where Kelchner's products were sold, south into the Carolinas, and north into New York and Massachusetts.  Awards  The company and has earned several awards at mustard competitions, with Silver Spring Beer ‚Äòn Brat Mustard winning top awards. At the 2010 Napa Valley Mustard Festival‚Äôs World-Wide Mustard Competition, Silver Spring earned a Grand Champion title for its popular Deli Style Mustard, while its Picante Pepper Mustard took home a bronze in the Pepper Hot category. Additionally, its Beer ‚Äòn Brat Horseradish Mustard nabbed a bronze in the Horseradish/Wasabi category, and its Organic Deli Mustard won the silver in the Organic category.  Operations  Silver Spring Foods, Inc. is now the world‚Äôs largest producer and processor of horseradish products. Revenue hit $50 million in 2011, and the company now employs over 165 people. The brands of the parent company, Huntsinger Farms Inc., also include Bookbinders Food Products, Atlantic Brand, and Thor- Shackel.

It serves the neighbourhood of St. Thomas Mount and Pazhavanthangal, which are suburbs of Chennai. It is located at a distance of from Chennai Beach terminus, with an elevation of above sea level. The station is also an integrated railway station for all the three modes of rail transport in the city, namely, Chennai suburban railway, MRTS, and Metro Rail. The latter two are under construction. Integrated Terminus  St. Thomas Mount Metro station is a Metro-cum-MRTS railway station on the Green Line of the Chennai Metro. The station is an elevated station abutting the surface- level St. Thomas Mount suburban station of the Chennai Suburban Railway Network. The metro level of the station started functioning on 14 October 2016 while the MRTS level is under construction. The new terminal is envisaged as an integrated railway station for all the three modes of rail transport in the city, namely, Chennai Beach‚ÄîChengalpattu section of the Chennai Suburban Railway, terminal point of Chennai Beach‚ÄîSt. Thomas Mount MRTS, and Chennai Central‚ÄìSt. Thomas Mount Metro Rail. Layout It is planned to design, the proposed elevated St Thomas Mount Metro Rail station, as a 'signature station' that would integrate all the 3 suburban rail modes of the city, at multiple levels. The integrated station will have three levels, namely, ground level for suburban station, level 1 for MRTS, and level 2 for Metro Rail. The length of the platform at the Metro station will be 140 m and the entire station complex will have a total built-up area of 48,000 sq m. =Level-0 - New suburban rail platform= The existing suburban station at ground level can be accessed from new terminal using an foot overbridge. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they will soon start work on the construction of this foot-over-bridge and complete it before commissioning of the station. As per the new design, the elevated station will have a Metro Rail station on the top floor, followed by an MRTS station a level below and then a vast concourse area for commuters to switch over to these two modes or to step down to the ground level, which will house - new ground level platform - for suburban trains, within the new Station block. =Level-1 - Concourse for mixing of Passengers= The concourse will have ticket booths and escalators and lifts will take commuters to the platforms above. =Level-2 - MRTS rail = The MRTS will be at a height of 12 m. =Level-3 - Metro rail = The station is among the elevated stations coming up along corridor II of the Chennai Metro, Chennai Central‚ÄìSt. Thomas Mount stretch. The station will be the largest of the elevated stations of the Chennai Metro and will come up at a height of 23 m. History The station lies in the Chennai Beach‚ÄìTambaram section of the Chennai Suburban Railway Network, the first suburban section of the city. With the completion of track-lying work in March 1931, which began in 1928, the suburban services were started on 11 May 1931 between Beach and Tambaram, and was electrified on 15 November 1931, with the first MG EMU services running on 1.5 kV DC. The section was converted to 25 kV AC traction on 15 January 1967. As of 2012, an integrated terminal for Chennai Metro and MRTS is under construction at the station complex at a cost of 780 million. The construction is expected to be completed by September 2013. The 780-million contract for the construction of the station was initially awarded to Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited (CCCL). However, owing to delay the contract was terminated and is being given to a new contractor. With the first service of Chennai Metro between Koyambedu and Alandur opened for public use - on 29 June 2015 - the Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has now shifted the focus on laying the track up to St. Thomas Mount. Future With the integration of five modes of public transport ‚Äì suburban railway, Southern Railway, Metro Rail, MRTS and public buses the station is expected to become the city's largest transit hub after Chennai Central. Access Roads A two-lane circular road has also been planned around the station so that buses can pick up commuters. Anticipating increased patronage upon the completion of Metro Rail, the Medavakkam-Madipakkam road that runs in front of the station is being widened. It is expected that MRTS and metro rail services will together bring in more than 100,000 commuters at the station. Parking Parking facility include 10,000 sq m space at the ground level and provisions for 3,000 two-wheelers at level 1. Upon completion, the station will be the third largest in the city after Chennai Central and Chennai Egmore. Express Train halt In June 2013, Southern Railway started the ground work to extend platforms at the station to halt express trains. A spare platform of the station, which is being used to park old rakes, is being extended at an estimated cost of 60 million. The platform, which can currently take only 22-coach trains, will be expanded to handle 24-rake trains and a link track will be laid.

An invasion of Belgian territory by either side was widely feared in 1870 and the Belgian Army was mobilised. The inadequacies which this revealed in Belgium's military and defensive preparations led to calls to reform the system of conscription and for a programme of fortification-building which would greatly influence the early phases of World War I. Belgium and the Crisis of 1870 King Leopold II, shown in military uniform The Treaty of London in 1839 had recognized Belgium as a sovereign state but committed it to a policy of perpetual neutrality. Its independence was intended to be guaranteed by the Belgian Army and the military intervention of the Treaty's signatory powers. However, there were doubts that the Treaty would be honoured if Belgium was attacked especially in the aftermath of the Luxembourg Crisis of 1867. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War led King Leopold II and the government of Jules d'Anethan, installed only two weeks before the war's outbreak, to fear that Belgium would be invaded. A career staff officer, Major General Guillaume, was appointed as a non-partisan expert Minister of War in the new cabinet.Albert Duchesne, \\"Guillaume (Gustave)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 38 (Brussels, 1973), 289-293. The gold reserves of the National Bank were hurried to the National Redoubt at Antwerp before the news became public. When this leaked out, it caused panic. The Belgian Army was called up on the 15 July, the same day that both French and German armies mobilised. The Belgian troops were divided into two armies; the Army of Antwerp (15,000 men) was tasked with guarding the fortresses at Antwerp and across Belgium while the Army of Observation (55,000 men) was tasked with defending the national borders. Many military leaders feared that, even after the outbreak of hostilities, as both French and Prussian armies manoeuvred on the Belgian border, one of them would seek a strategic advantage by an outflanking attack through Belgium, and most believed the army incapable of fending off any such attack. Indeed, in the early part of the war, French Marshal Canrobert brought an entire Army Corps (4 infantry divisions) to Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne in northern France as a reserve and to guard against any Prussian advance through Belgium. Despite key battles taking place very close to Belgian territory, including the Battle of Sedan just a few miles from the border, Belgium was never actually attacked. In order to avoid giving the impression of belligerence in the conflict, Leopold requested that the French not commit Belgian members of the French Foreign Legion during the conflict. The French agreed and Belgian legionnaires remained in their base in French Algeria while their comrades were deployed to the front. The decision outraged the other legionaries and the Legion's march, Le Boudin, makes repeated reference to the fact that the Belgians \\"[only] shoot from their rear-end\\" (\\"tireurs au cul\\") because of it. Legacy Entry to the Fort d'√âvegn√©e near Li√®ge built in the 1880s, following the crisis of 1870‚Äì1 The Franco‚ÄìPrussian War made Belgians acutely aware of the precarious situation of their country in the event of another war between the two powers. In the years following the conflict, there was widespread modernisation of the military. The system of Remplacement (whereby wealthy Belgians conscripted into the military could pay for a \\"replacement\\" to do their military service instead), which had been viewed as a crucial personal liberty by many Belgians was abolished, and an improved system of conscription implemented. These reforms, led by d'Anethan and under pressure from Leopold II, divided Belgian politics. The Catholics united with the Liberals under Fr√®re-Orban to oppose them, and the reforms were finally defeated when d'Anethan's government fell during an unrelated scandal. Eventually, the military was reformed. The 1909 System abolished the inefficient system of Remplacement, instituting compulsory military service of eight years' service in the front lines and five years in the reserves. This swelled the size of the Belgian army to over 100,000 well-trained men. Construction of a chain of forts along Belgium's borders was intensified, and led to a series of very modern fortifications, including the so-called \\"National redoubt\\" at Antwerp, at Li√®ge and Namur, many of them designed by the great Belgian fortress architect, Henri Alexis Brialmont. A commemorative medal, the 1870‚Äì71 Commemorative Medal, was inaugurated to the veterans of the conflict in 1911.

It is part of the 17th century Trinitatis Complex, which includes the Rundet√•rn astronomical observatory tower and the Copenhagen University Library, in addition to the church. Built in the time of Christian IV, the church initially served the students of Copenhagen University. It is situated at the corner of Landem√¶rket and K√∏bmagergade. The interior was seriously damaged in the fire of 1728 but was rebuilt in 1731.\\"Trinitatis Church\\" , Visit Copenhagen. Retrieved 16 December 2012. History Initial plans in 1635 were for a student church at Regensen, the dormitory for students at Copenhagen University, but the following year, new plans emerged with the corner of Landem√¶rket and K√∏bmagergade earmarked for the church location, as it was decided to include the church in a complex extending to a church library and an astronomical observatory. The humanistically inspired combination was from a commission of Christian IV. There were three builders, namely Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger, Leonhard Blasius, and Albertus Mathiesen. At the time of construction, the church was the second largest in the city, second only to the Church of Our Lady. As the church was only intended to be used by university students and professors, it may appear oversized, but all indications are that the library space above the nave needed a certain church size. The foundation stone was laid July 7, 1637, and the Round Tower was completed in 1642. The church was consecrated on Trinity Sunday 1656. The Copenhagen University Library was installed in the church loft in 1657. After marrying the widow of J.M. Radeck in 1685, Christian Geist assumed Radeck's organist position at the church. Thurah's drawing (1748) During the fire of 1728, the Trinitatis Church was not as badly damaged as other churches in the city. The roof structure was ignited, a spire crashed into the library, punching a hole in some of the arches of the church. The university library was burnt. Church walls and vaults withstood the fire and subsequent repairs did not decisively change the church's appearance. A new cornice and spire were required. The new roof was covered with black glazed tiles. New dormer windows were inserted but only in one row. The interior bases and capitals of the columns and arches were repaired. All wood furnishings were replaced, and the floor was covered with tiles from √ñland. The reconstruction was in Northern Gothic-Baroque style. The church was rededicated October 7, 1731 and the remains of the university library were moved again. The furnishings were renewed with an altarpiece and pulpit by Friederich Ehbisch (1731) and a large Baroque clock (1757). The church was refurbished in 1763. The northwest portal from 1870. The Trinitatis Complex was hit during the 1807 British bombardment of Copenhagen, and damaged by major fires. Four bombs struck the library, but did not penetrate through to the church. Thanks to the efforts of churchwarden Tvermoes, injuries were minimized. Building repairs amounted to relatively modest 3,000 rigsdaler. Alterations were necessary in 1817 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Reformation. It was determined that the church's main entrance, the southwest portal, did not have suitable access through the fence wall and the cemetery for the procession of priests and professors who would join the festivities, so the north face became the church front. The small shops on the corner of Landem√¶rket were closed, as was the remainder of the cemetery north of the church. The original portals were replaced with new ones, designed by Peder Malling. The eastern entrance was also reopened, having been bricked up for a number of years. A major restoration was completed in 1834-35 by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch, funded by a bequest from Christopher Hauschildt. Most of the work took place inside the building, including a vestry, detached on the south side of the choir. The roof was refurbished in 1848-49 without affecting its appearance. In 1861, the university library moved from the church attic to Johan Daniel Herholdt's library building in Fiolstr√¶de. External renovations occurred 1869-71 by a design of Niels Sigfred Nebelong in connection with a change in the church's patronage. The sacristy on the south side of the chorus was removed and a new one built by the east gable, measuring approximately , with cut corners; it was transformed into a priest room in 1960. The notable chamber choir dates to 1993. Architecture and fittings The original church consisted of a high, long brick building without much adornment, constructed of small Dutch bricks. The brickwork was laid in a cross-linking pattern of yellow and red stripes, obscured by accumulated dirt. Alterations and repairs in 1675 may have changed the building's appearance. The current exterior dates to the 1870 renovation. The interior is painted white. It consists of a nave with two lofty aisles and a chancel with a three-sided termination.\\"Trinitatis Kirke (K√∏benhavn)\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 16 December 2012. Shaped as a longhouse, it is divided by eight pillars, the easternmost having chamfered corners. The roof was originally covered with slate. A fl√®che over the chancel houses the bells. The building's west end integrates the Rundet√•rn tower, which has a spiraling ramp to the top. Other features include buttresses and high granite plinths. The eastern sections have rounded corners. An original rectangular window is near the library floor. The tower originally had arched window openings. On the roof there were dormer windows in two rows. There were four gateways to the church, two on the north side and two on the south side. The church's south side was originally considered the front. As in a village church, the choir was set in the east, and the tower in the west, although the Round Tower was not part of the church. There are vaulted ceilings. The sanctuary was divided by two rows of seven columns in the longitudinal direction matching the church's exterior. What once functioned as the Library Hall now serves as an exhibition gallery and venue for classical concerts. The Marcussen & S√∏n organ dates to 1956. Grounds Geddes map of 1757. A cemetery was added on the church grounds as evidenced by Geddes' 1757 map of the neighborhood. After the Copenhagen Fire of 1795, which did not affect Trinitatis Church, a mandate for fire insurance was imposed. As the premium was substantial for the church's small resources, the church attorney, Nicolaj Christoffer Kall, suggested building shops on church property and renting them out to help increase revenues. The proposal was approved and construction began in 1798. Most of the cemetery north of the church was involved, and the shops were built along K√∏bmagergade from the Round Tower to Landem√¶rket, and further along Landem√¶rket. Positioned on the south side of the church, features include a burial vault (1870) and granite tiles (1928-29).

He is the head of the Bil'in Popular Committee against the Wall, which has led weekly demonstrations since 2005 against the Israeli West Bank barrier. He is also head of Friends of Freedom and Justice in Bil‚Äôin, a pro- Palestinian organization with the stated aims of building a \\"wide network of people from all over the globe who support Freedom and Justice for all\\" Activism In 1990, at 17 years, Burnat was charged and sentenced for throwing stones at IDF soldiers and was jailed for two years. He has been arrested and imprisoned for non-violently protesting Israeli actions more than 10 times since. Iyad's house has been the target of numerous night-raids by Israeli soldiers. In 2004, the Israeli military built a wall separating village farmers from their lands, removed 1000 olive trees and restricted travel in the name of protecting Israeli settlers. Since 2005, Bil'in villagers have been engaging in weekly Friday demonstrations against these activities, along with Israeli citizens and international peace activists. Burnat has been leading the demonstrations. In September 2007 Israel's high court ruled that the wall on the outskirts of Bil'in unnecessarily interfered with the residents without offering any security advantage. Burnat said: \\"It's not easy for the Supreme Court to return land. This is a historic step...The steadfast peaceful resistance of the villagers of Bil'in resulted in the decision to partially remove the wall in the village.\\" The Washington Times compared Burnat's philosophy of Palestinian protest tactics to the writings of Martin Luther King Jr. or Mahatma Gandhi.Peaceful protests bring down barrier; Israeli court orders removal of disruptive fence in village, Washington Times, September 6, 2007, via Questia Online Library. In 2007 Burnat described his choice of nonviolent protest, saying \\"The belief in one's rights is more important than anything else. If I am confident about my rights, nothing will make me despair...When you resist an Israeli soldier by peaceful means, their weapons become irrelevant.\\" The Christian Science Monitor reported that \\"the strategy paid off\\" when Israel's Supreme Court issued a ruling on the path of the fence around Bilin. In November 2008 Burnat and a group of American peace activists were denied entry into the Palestinian town of Ni'lin. He later was arrested in a November 21 morning raid. He was fined and released in December 2008. In the May 15, 2009 march, Iyad Burnat was severely injured along with eight others. In March 2010, Burnat was questioned by officers from Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, after he sent an emailed report about the previous weeks protests titled, \\"The Third Intifada is knocking on the door\\". That year he also was banned by the Shin Bet, for security reasons, from traveling to Europe to participate in two conferences. In April 2010 Burnat organized, with Luisa Morgantini, the former vice president of the Italian parliament, the fifth annual Bil'in Conference on non-violent popular resistance against the fence and the settlements. Twenty-five foreign consuls and envoys took part in the conference, including representatives of the United Nations and the European Union.

During a December 2010 protest, where activists dressed as the fictional blue-skinned, pointy-haired, long-tailed indigenous characters of the Na'vi tribe from the film Avatar, Burnat proclaimed partial victory in their protests. Per the Israeli court ruling, Israelis had begun preparations for the construction of the wall's new route which returns to the village 30 percent of its land. He said \\"We feel relieved and feel the non- violent resistance is successful in its aim.\\"Watch: Avatars against the wall in Bil'in, Ma'an News Agency, February 2, 2010; updated February 13, 2010.

Background After the release of Gold Cobra in 2011 and subsequent touring, Limp Bizkit left their longtime label Interscope Records in December of the same year owing to creative differences and poor sales of the album. On February 24, Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records, and revealed plans to release a new single, \\"Ready to Go\\", a full-length album and a sequel to their 2005 album, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1). Cash Money co-founder Birdman said, \\"If we find some great talent, we're gonna embrace it. Limp Bizkit, to me, is just a perfect match for us‚Ä¶ It was something that Fred Durst was interested in doing, and I was already a fan, and I was like, 'Let's do it.' It's good for the brand, it will bring a different look for us, and we're definitely trying to expand on that side of music.\\" However, after a dispute between frontman Fred Durst over his and John Otto's \\"partying habits\\" and drug abuse, DJ Lethal was fired from the band in March 2012. Guitarist Wes Borland released a second studio album with his side project Black Light Burns in mid 2012 and toured in support of the album throughout 2012. It was only in December that the band's first offering for Cash Money was seen. A song called \\"Lightz (City of Angels)\\" was prematurely leaked via YouTube. In October 2012, DJ Lethal posted an apology using his Twitter account and was accepted back by the band, but he was dismissed again and left out of their upcoming 2013 tour of the US, replaced by touring turntablist DJ Skeletor. As of 2020, the album has still not been released, in December 2015, it was rumored Durst was possibly holding back the release because he was not happy with the recordings. In February 2016, Metal Injection reported that the band was still in the studio recording the new album. Recording and composition Rapper and former labelmate Lil Wayne performed the guest vocals on \\"Ready to Go\\".The band started working on the album in 2012, when they signed with Cash Money. The single, \\"Ready to Go\\" was produced by hip hop producer Polow da Don. Durst had then told Billboard that he was putting the finishing touches on the track in March 2013. In their positive review of the single, Artistdirect wrote, \\"'Ready to Go' feels like a band reawakened in many ways. At the same time, it's the Bizkit the world knows and loves from Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\". In May 2013, amidst their tour of the United States, Borland told Billboard, \\"We're really trying to get it hammered out here. We're done with most of the music, pretty much all the music. I've mixed two songs and have a lot more mixing to do. The lyrics and vocals are probably 30 percent done, and Fred is working as we speak, on tour.\\" Describing the album's sound, he said, \\" [It's] a little more pressure-free and a little more fun. I think it's a little bit more sort of playful, taking chances, a little less pop structured type of stuff. I don't want to say it (sounds) younger, but maybe a little more carefree, musically, to where we don't over-think what we're doing. We're leaving mistakes in and going, 'Oh, that sounds great, leave that in.' That's sort of the thinking instead of polishing too much or trying to stay within the parameters of a formula.\\" He also said that producer Ross Robinson (who previously produced the band's debut album and The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)) has worked on \\"a little bit\\" of the album, along with the label's producer Detail, although it was primarily \\"a do-it- yourself affair.\\" He further explained the album title, saying, \\"[It's] just from being stupid. I think we saw a disco ball elephant in the window of a shop somewhere. We were like, 'Look, it's a disco elephant. We should call our record Stampede of the Disco Elephants.' It's just a 10-second conversation that snowballed.\\" In an October 2018 BBC interview with Bring Me The Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes it was revealed that he and Jordan Fish (the band's keyboardist as well as producer alongside Sykes) originally went to Los Angeles to help write the album with the band the year prior, however it was eventually abandoned. According to Sykes, Durst \\"didn't show up most of the time\\" and felt that he wasn't ready to record the album yet. Some of the riffs written from those sessions were then put into Bring Me The Horizon's song Wonderful Life from their 2019 album amo.  Release  The album was first announced in early 2012, with the intention of releasing it by the end of 2012. The album has suffered many delays since its announcement in 2012, and by 2016 it was in development hell. During an interview/talk with the podcast Someone Who Isn't Me that took place in September 2016, guitarist Wes Borland said he was unsure of Fred Durst's ideas for the album, though the original plan was to make music in the spirit of Beastie Boys' studio album, Paul's Boutique. Borland elaborated that Durst had been working on vocals \\"on and off\\" for the album but had not been satisfied with the outcome. Whereas Borland would prefer to \\"do whatever and just put it out\\" to capture the moment, Durst's method is to \\"keep working on something till he‚Äôs happy with it, even if it takes years and years\\", and expressed uncertainty of when the album would be released, if ever. On 21 July 2017, Durst claimed in an interview that he had secretly released the album online a year and a half previously, but that it's \\"[the fans'] job to find it\\".Has Limp Bizkit's Stampede of the Disco Elephants Been Out for a Year-and-a-Half Already? MetalSucks However, Borland said in October 2017 that he was unaware of the status of the album, simply that he had recorded \\"28 or 29 songs\\" that Durst was working on away from the other members, before Borland was to mix the final product. Promotion Borland had stated in 2013 that the album would be completed by August and the band was hoping for a September release date. However, in July 2013, Durst stated on a Reddit \\"Ask Me Anything\\" event that the record will be released in the first quarter of 2014, but the album has since been indefinitely postponed. The intended first official single for the album, \\"Ready to Go\\", featuring Lil Wayne and Ranaldo was released in March 2013, on limpbizkit.com as a free download and, on April 16, as a digital single on iTunes and Amazon and the music video, directed by Durst, was released on 22 July. On August 20, 2013, Limp Bizkit posted on their Facebook page that a second single is to be expected soon. It was soon confirmed to be set for release on November 1, 2013. The second single turned out to be \\"Thieves\\"; a cover of the song by Ministry that they performed live at Woodstock in 1999 and throughout many of their live sets since 1997, but hadn't released a studio version until now. A month later, on December 11, the previously leaked track, \\"Lightz\\" was officially released as a promotional single, along with an accompanying music video. The band labelled it as \\"gift\\" for their fans. Via an official Facebook post on May 30, 2014, the next single, \\"Endless Slaughter\\" was confirmed. Referring to it as the first \\"experience\\" off their upcoming album, the track is set to be released on cassette only during concerts, with the band encouraging potential listeners to invest in a \\"BOOM BOX for your analogue listening pleasure\\". The single has since been released as a free download on their website and has since been given its own music video. Limp Bizkit will embark upon a European tour from June 24 to July 4, 2014, followed by 2 dates in USA and finally culminating on November 16 at the second annual Knotfest in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo, where Limp Bizkit will perform along with festival founders Slipknot, longtime friends Korn, and other heavy metal acts such as Lamb of God, Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium and In Flames. On July 8, 2019 the band played a new song from their forthcoming album called \\"Wasteoid\\" live in Paris. Reception Pre-release The album has received notoriety for its repeated delays, with Team Rock and The New Zealand Herald dubbing it \\"Chinese Democracy of nu metal\\". The album was featured in The Atlantic's 2014 preview of upcoming albums, listing it as one of their albums \\"not worth getting excited about\\" and calling the album title \\"dreadful\\".

Davaka, currently in Nagaon district (central Assam), is not mentioned in historical texts again, which indicates that the kings of Kamarupa must have absorbed it.\\"It is presumed that (Kalyana Varman) conquered Davaka, incorporating it within the kingdom of Kamarupa\\" Though the kingdom came to be known as Kamarupa, the kings called themselves the rulers of Pragjyotisha (Pragjyotishadhipati), and not Kamarupa;\\"The name Kamarupa does not appear in local grants where Pragjyotisha alone figures with the local rulers called Pragjyotishadhipati.\\" nevertheless Kamarupa continued to be mentioned in inscriptions, such as Nidhanpur inscription of Bhaskar Varman.Epigraphia Indica Vol XII and XIX Vaidydeva, an 11th-century ruler, named Kamarupa as a mandala within the Pragjyotisha bhukti. According to Sircar, the Kamarupa mandala is congruent to undivided Kamrup of the modern times. Although the epigraphic records define Kamarupa as a smaller region within the historic kingdom, the 9th‚Äì10th-century shakta work Kalika Purana names the kingdom Kamarupa. Yogini Tantra provides the traditional boundary: Karatoya river in the west, Dikkaravasini (Sadiya) in the east and the Brahmaputra-Lakhya river confluence in the south forming a triangle. Both the western boundary as well as the name agrees with the 7th-century account left by Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang who visited the region in the seventh century c.e, identified the kingdom as Kamarupa (Ka-mo-lu-po) which was located to the east of the Karatoya (Ka-lo-tu). Though the ancient kingdom covered initially present undivided Kamrup region, Western AssamTej Ram Sharma (1978), Personal and Geographical Names in the Gupta Inscriptions, p.254 but later expanded to include rest of the Brahmaputra valley, North Bengal as well as most of the northern parts of Bangladesh, Bhutan and at some point parts of Bengal and Bihar, starting with acquisition of Davaka (Central Assam) in east. The medieval and pre-modern usage of \\"Kamrup\\" was limited to North Bengal and western Assam. Historic Silsako bridge Medieval Kamrup Kamrup/Kamata (1255-1581) The Kamarupa region soon lost a unified political rule. Sandhya, a 13th-century ruler in the Kamarupanagara (North Guwahati), moved his capital to present-day North Bengal and his kingdom came to be called Kamata;\\"Hema Saraswati in his Prahrada-carit says that Durlabhanarayan was the unequaled king of Kamata-mandala\\" or sometimes as Kamata-Kamrup, with its eastern boundary at the Manas river.\\"The invasion of Mughisuddin, though abortive, had shaken the Kamarupa kingdom. It was reorganized as a new state. 'Kamata' by name with Kamatapur as capital. The exact time when the change was made is uncertain. But possibly it had been made by Sandhya (c1250-1270) as a safeguard against mounting dangers from the east and the west. Its control over the eastern regions beyond the Manah (Manas river) was lax.\\" This kingdom was a part of the original Kamarupa kingdom and included in general Koch Bihar, Darrang, Kamrup districts, and northern Mymensing. In the extreme east of the erstwhile Kamarupa kingdom the Chutiya, Kachari and the Ahom kingdoms emerged, with the Baro-Bhuyans providing the buffer between these kingdoms in the east and the Kamata kingdom in the west. Kamrup/Koch Hajo (1581-1612) In the beginning of the 16th century Viswa Singha filled the vacuum left by the destruction of the Khen dynasty of Kamata and consolidated his rule over the Baro-Bhuyan chieftains ruling over the Kamrup region, and by the time of Naranarayana, the kingdom extended a firm rule between the Karatoya and the Bhareli rivers. Even though the Koch kings called themselves Kamateshwars (lords of Kamata), their kingdom came to be called the Koch kingdom and not as Kamrup. In 1581 the Kamata kingdom was bifurcated with Raghudev gaining control over the portion to the east of the Sankosh river up to the Bharali riverThough Chilarai and Naranarayana established control up to Subansiri river via the Treaty of Majuli, the Sukhaamphaa recovered control between Bhareli and Subansiri soon after. in the north bank; and east of the Brahmaputra in present-day Bangladesh. Raghudev's kingdom came to be called Koch Hajo in Muslim chronicles, and Kamrup in Ekasarana documents.\\"The eastern division (of the Koch kingdom) was known as 'Kamrup' in the local sources and as 'Koch Hajo' in the Persian chronicles.\\" As the Mughal gained power in Dhaka, Koch Bihar entered into an alliance with them and arraigned themselves against Parikshitnarayana, the son of Raghudev, who had come to power in Koch Hajo in the meanwhile. The Mughals pushed eastward, removed Parikshit from power in Koch Hajo/Kamrup by 1615 (up to the Barnadi river), and came into direct military conflict with the Ahom kingdom; and after the first round of battles, they established control over nearly the entire Koch Hajo, right up to Barnadi river.Treaty of Asurar Ali Sarkar Kamrup (1612-1682) Ahom King Rudra Singha, is said to have continued to pay great attention to Powa Makkah Mosque in Hajo even after the expulsion of the Mughals from Assam in 1682. The Mughals established four sarkars in the newly acquired land---among which were Dhekeri (between Sankosh and Manas) and Kamrup (between Manas and Barnadi). Kamrup was also renamed as Shujabad, after Shah Shuja, the Subahdar of Bengal. There were a number of Muslim rulers of Kamrup during this period and they were referred to as the Faujdars of Shujabad. The sixth faujdar, Lutfullah Shirazi, built a hilltop mosque in Koch Hajo in 1657. The mosque contained the mazar (mausoleum) of Prince Ghiyath ad-Din Awliya of Iraq, who is commonly credited for introducing Islam to the region. The Mughals lost Kamrup forever in 1682 after the Battle of Itakhuli. Incomplete list of Faujdars of Guahati: #Makram Khan (1612-1614) #Mir Sufi (1614-1616) #Shaykh Kamal (1616-1632) #Abd as-Salam (1632-1638) #Noorullah (1638-1656) #Lutfullah Shirazi (1656-1658) Kamrup/Borphukan's domain (1682-1820) After the Battle of Itakhuli (1682), the Ahom kingdom established control over Sarkar Kamrup, and it became the domain of the Borphukan, based in Guwahati. The region continued to be called Kamrup and its eastern and western boundaries were identical to the later British district.\\"Camroop (Kamrup), on the west, or towards Bengal, is bounded by the Manaha river (Manas river); on the north by Raotan, on the east by Bushnudeee (Barnadi river) which separates it from Dehrungh (Darrang) and on the south by Berhampooter (Brahmaputra river)\\", Wade, Dr John Peter, (1805) \\"A Geographical Sketch of Assam\\" in Asiatic Annual Register, reprinted In addition to the Kamrup region, the Borphukan's domain included the additional region to the east up to Kaliabor. The Koch prince that oversaw Darrang, too, reported to the Borphukan. The Ahoms did not impose their administrative system fully over Kamrup, and the resultant pargana-based system was a mixed Mughal-Ahom system, in contrast to the Paik system in the rest of the kingdom in the east. Kamrup/Burmese empire (1821-1824) The region became part of the Burmese empire between 1821 and 1824. Colonial Kamrup (1833-1947) The region came under Burmese control in 1822. The British, in control over the region to the west of the Manas river since the transfer of Bengal in 1765, marched into Guwahati on 28 March 1824 at the beginning of the First Anglo-Burmese War and established administrative control by October. The Kamrup district that the British constituted in 1833/1836 was largely congruous to the Mughal Sarkar Kamrup of 1639. Indian Institute of Technology, North Guwahati Modern Kamrup After Indian Independence in 1947, the Kamrup district maintained its form. The district was divided, beginning in 1983, and the original district is often called \\"Undivided Kamrup district\\". The Kamapitha, Sarkar Kamrup of 1639 and the Undivided Kamrup district from the Colonial as well as the Independent periods is today defined as the Kamrup.

Failures in high-speed networks have always been a concern of utmos importance. A single fiber cut can lead to heavy losses of traffic and protection-switching techniques have been used as the key source to ensure survivability in networks. Survivability can be addressed in many layers in a network and protection can be performed at the physical layer (SONET/SDH, Optical Transport Network), Layer 2 (Ethernet, MPLS) and Layer 3 (IP). Protection architectures like Path protection and Link protection safeguard the above- mentioned networks from different kinds of failures. In path protection, a backup path is used from the source to its destination to bypass the failure. In Link protection, the end nodes of the failed link initiate the protection. These nodes detect the fault responsible to initiate the protection mechanisms in order to detour the affected traffic from the failed link onto predetermined reserved paths. Other types of protection are channel-, segment- and p-cycle protection. Link Protection in the Optical Transport Layer In older high-speed transport networks, the SONET layer (also SDH) was the main client wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) layer. For this reason, before WDM protection schemes were defined, SONET protection mechanisms were mainly adopted to guarantee optical network survivability. When the WDM layer was created, the optical networks survivability techniques in consideration were mainly based on many elements of SONET protection in order to ensure maximum compatibility with the legacy systems (SONET systems). Hence some of the WDM- layer protection techniques are very similar to SONET/SDH protection techniques in the case of ring networks. Ring-Based protection A four- fiber BLSR: Two fibers are used as working fibers and the other two are used as protection fibers, to be utilized in the case of a failure. In the case of a link or network failure, the simplest mechanism for network survivability is automatic protection switching (APS). APS techniques involve reserving a protection channel (dedicated or shared) with the same capacity of the channel or element being protected. When a shared protection technique is used, an APS protocol is needed to coordinate access to the shared protection bandwidth. An example of a link-based protection architecture at the Optical Transport Network layer is a Bidirectional Line Switched Ring (BLSR). In a BLSR, every link can carry both the working and backup traffic at the same time and hence does not require backup links. Unlike a UPSR (see SONET), in a BLSR, under normal circumstances, the protection fiber is unused and this is beneficial to ISP's since they can use the protection fiber to send lower priority traffic (using protection bandwidth) like data traffic and voice traffic. There are two architectures for BLSRs. The four-fiber BLSR and the two-fiber BLSR. In a four-fiber BLSR, two fibers are used as working fibers and the other two are used as protection fibers, to be utilized in the case of a failure. Four-fiber BLSRs use two types of protection mechanisms during failure recovery, namely ring and span switching. In span switching, when the source or destination on a link fails, traffic gets routed onto the protection fiber between the two nodes on the same link and when a fiber or cable cut occurs, service is restored using the ring switching mechanism. In a two-fiber BLSR, the protection fibers are contained within the working fibers (like a four-fiber BLSR) and both the fibers are used to carry working traffic whilst keeping only half the capacity on each fiber for protection purposes. Two-fiber BLSRs also benefit from the ring switching but cannot perform span switching like a four-fiber BLSR. Due to its efficiency in protection, BLSRs are widely deployed in long haul and interoffice networks, where the traffic pattern is more distributed than in access networks. Most metro carriers have deployed two-fiber BLSRs, while many long-haul carriers have deployed four-fiber BLSRs since they can handle more load than two-fiber BLSRs. Mesh-based protection The techniques mentioned above for SONET and WDM networks can also be applied to mesh network architectures provided there are ring decompositions for the mesh architectures; and use well defined protection- switching schemes to restore service when a failure occurs. The three most notable ring-based protection techniques for mesh networks are ring covers, cycle double covers and p-cycles (pre-configured protection cycles). The main goal of the ring cover technique is to find a set of rings that covers all the network links and then use these rings to protect the network against failures. Some network links in the ring cover might get used in more than one ring which can cause additional redundancy in the network and because of this reason, scaling down redundancy is the primary focus of this technique. The cycle double covers technique provides one protection fiber for each working fiber (like in SONET rings) keeping 100% redundancy. This technique was initially proposed to remove the additional redundancy issue caused by the ring cover scheme. The p-cycle technique is based on the property of a ring to protect not only its own links, but also any possible links connecting two non-adjacent ring nodes called chordal links. By doing this, p-cycles reduce the redundancy required to protect a mesh network against link failure. There are two types of p-cycles namely link p-cycles and node p-cycles. Link p-cycles protect all channels on a link whereas a node p-cycle protects all the connections traversing a node. One of the best features of p-cycles is its ability to allow savings in spare resources and they are also recognized to be the most efficient protection structures as for capacity minimization. However, p- cycle planning is an NP-hard problem and is not scalable. Another technique called the generalized loopback technique can be included under ring-based approaches. Although it is not strictly considered as one of the mesh-based ring protection techniques, its usage of a loopback operation is similar to the APS operation in rings to switch the signal from working to the redundant capacity. Link protection in the Client/Service Layer Protection in Ethernet Ethernet links use link aggregation as a mechanism to recover from failures. Even when a link fails, its link capacity gets reduced but the communication system keeps working without interruptions in data flow. Other terms used to describe link aggregation include IEEE 802.1ax (formerly knows as 802.3ad), link bundling or NIC teaming. Protection in IP In recent years, packet based networks made a big leap and almost every single service provided (voice, IP-TV, etc.) is IP based. This is due to the reason that the IP layer has long provided best-effort services. IP uses dynamic, hop-by-hop routing of packets and if there is a link failure, the routing protocols (OSPF or IS-IS) operates in a distributed manner and updates the routing table at each router in the domain. This process can get slow and cause heavy delays in the network. In order to avoid slow recovery, every IP link can be protected using protocols at the lower levels which will help the IP links to recover by itself instead of waiting for the IP routing table to change. For example, IP links can be realized by protected MPLS using Label Switched Paths ‚Äì LSPs (IP over MPLS). Protection in MPLS Networks Between LSRs A and B a tunnel (orange) is set up. When the link between LSR A and B fails, the initial LSP (black) is redirected down the orange tunnel so that there is no disruption of data flow between A and B. MPLS based networks use fast re-route as its network resiliency mechanism. In MPLS fast re-route, MPLS data can be directed around a link failure without the need to perform any signaling when a failure is detected. One form of fast re-route is called Link Protection. In this protection, an LSP tunnel is set up through the network to provide a backup for a vulnerable physical link. The LSP provides a parallel virtual link. When the physical link fails, the upstream node switches traffic to the virtual link so that data continues to flow with a minimal disruption. The capacity of the backup LSP should be sufficient to carry the protected LSPs. Depending on the LSPs, the capacity needs to be configured. For instance, if all the LSPs are to be protected, then the net capacity should equal the bandwidth of the protected link. By doing this, the backup bandwidth would increase if multiple links were to be protected. On the other hand, by leaving some LSPs over the link unprotected, the backup bandwidth can be reduced.

Police harassment at California Hall On the eve of January 1, 1965, several homophile organizations in San Francisco, California - including the Council on Religion and the Homosexual, the Society for Individual Rights, the Daughters of Bilitis, and the Mattachine Society - held a fund-raising ball for their mutual benefit at the California Hall. Prior to the ball, several of the ministers from the Council on Religion met with San Francisco police, who tried to get them to cancel it. The clergy members declined to cancel the event, and San Francisco police agreed not to interfere. However, on the evening of the ball, the police showed up in force and surrounded the California Hall and focused numerous kleig lights on the entrance to the hall. As each of the 600 plus persons entering the ball approached the entrance, the police took their photographs. A number of police vans were parked in plain view near the entrance to the ball. Evander Smith, a lawyer for the groups organizing the ball, and Herb Donaldson tried to stop the police from conducting the fourth \\"inspection\\" of the evening; both were arrested, along with two heterosexual lawyers - Elliott Leighton and Nancy May - who were supporting the rights of the participants to gather at the ball. On January 2, 1965, ministers associated with the Council on Religion and the Homosexual held a news conference in protest of Smith, Donaldson, and the other two lawyers arrested as well as the police harassment to which the ball attendees had been subjected. Twenty-five of the most prominent lawyers in San Francisco joined the defense team for the four lawyers, and the judge directed the jury to find the four not-guilty before the defense had even had a chance to begin their argumentation when the case came to court. The event has been called \\"San Francisco's Stonewall\\" by some historians; the participation of such prominent litigators in the defense of Smith, Donaldson and the other two lawyers marked a turning point in gay rights on the West Coast of the United States. Later career Governor Jerry Brown appointed Donaldson as the first openly gay male municipal court judge in the state of California in 1983. He retired in 1999. Four years later, he began serving a three-year term as judge of San Francisco's new Behavioral Health Court.

Background Following the capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354, Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans was rapid. Although they had to halt their advance during the Kidnapping of ≈ûehzade Halil between 1357‚Äì59, after Halil's rescue they resumed their advance. The main target of the advance was Adrianople, which was the third most important Byzantine city (after Constantinople and Thessalonica). Whether under Ottoman control or as independent ghazi or akinji warrior bands, the Turks seized Demotika (Didymoteicho) in 1360 or 1361 and Philippopolis in 1363. Despite the recovery of Gallipoli for Byzantium by the Savoyard Crusade in 1366, an increasing number of Turcoman warriors crossed over from Anatolia into Europe, gradually acquiring control of the plains of Thrace and pushing to the Rhodope Mountains in the west and the Bulgarian principalities in the north. Capture of Adrianople The date of Adrianople's fall to the Turks has been disputed among scholars due to the differing accounts in the source material, with the years 1361 to 1362, 1367 and 1371 variously proposed. Following sources dating from long after the events, earlier scholarship generally placed the conquest between 1361 and 1363, in accordance with the report in Ottoman sources that a solar eclipse occurred in the year of Adrianople's fall.Beldiceanu-Steinherr, Ir√®ne, La conqu√™te d'Andrinople par les Turcs: la p√©n√©tration turque en Thrace et la valeur des chroniques ottomanes in Travaux et M√©moires du Centre de Recherche d'Histoire et Civilisation de Byzance vol. 1 (1965) p. 439ff. Thus later Turkish sources report that Lala Shahin Pasha defeated the Byzantine ruler (tekfur) of the city at a battle in Sazlƒ±dere southeast of the city, forcing him to flee secretly by boat. The inhabitants, left to their fate, agreed to surrender the city in July 1362 in exchange for a guarantee of freedom to continue to live in the city as before. Based on Elisabeth Zachariadou's examination of previously unregarded Byzantine sources, most modern scholars have moved to the view that the city was captured in 1369. Thus a poem from the city's metropolitan bishop to Emperor John V Palaiologos shows Adrianople to have still been in Byzantine hands in Christmas 1366, while a series of Byzantine short chronicles place the date of its capture in 1369. In addition, modern scholars opine that the capture of Adrianople may not have been carried out by Ottoman Turks, but by others among the many independently operating akinji groups in the region. Aftermath The city, now renamed Edirne, was taken over and continued for some time to be administered by Lala Shahin Pasha, while Sultan Murad I held court at the old capital at Bursa and only entered the city in the winter of 1376/7, when Emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos ceded Gallipoli to Murad in exchange for his help in a dynastic civil war. Edirne did not immediately become the Ottomans' capital; Murad's court continued to reside in Bursa and in nearby Demotika, as well as Edirne. Nevertheless, the city quickly became the main Ottoman military centre in the Balkans, and it was there that S√ºleyman √áelebi, one of the contenders for the Ottoman throne during the Ottoman Interregnum of 1402‚Äì13, moved the state treasury. The conquest of Adrianople was a turning point in the history of the Ottomans in Europe: prior to this the Balkan peoples had regarded them as transient raiders, like so many that came before them in centuries prior. Instead, the transformation of Adrianople into the new Ottoman capital of Edirne signalled to the local populace that the Ottomans intended to settle permanently in Europe.

The system was initially released for general office use in the United States, with the SMC-70G and SMC-70GP (released in 1983) designed for professional video generation, for example in cable television applications, and digital video effect generation. It was the first computer that used the recently invented (in 1981 - also by Sony) 3.5\\" micro floppy disk drive that was modified to become the industry standard. Like many home and office computers of the eraincluding the Sinclair ZX-80, ZX81, ZX Spectrum, and QL computers, Acorn Atom, BBC Micro, Seven S, ABC 80, ABC 800, Compis, Microbee., it had its own specially developed version of BASIC. Sony BASIC was designed to take advantage of a color Sony Trinitron display. The SMC-70 did not run Microsoft BASIC, despite the system being designed to compete in the US market. With optional expansion ROMs the system could display kanji characters.old- computers.com entryJapanese computer museum ipsj The system was expandable, allowing users to install a disk controller with one or two internal 3.5\\" disk drives (the base system did not include a floppy disk controller or disk drives). The floppy disk controller supported up to two additional 3.5\\" disk drives (for a total of four). The base system included the following external ports: I/O expansion , black and white monitor, RGB monitor, parallel printer, light pen, cassette deck, number pad, headphone, and RS-232C. The system could further be expanded by plug-in modules. The SMC-70 had three externally available expansion ports (the unit split apart in the middle and expanded to accommodate one, two, or three modules). Users were limited by the available power from the power supply (0.95A at 120V - 114 watts). Released modules included: * 8-inch FDD control unit (Shugart interface) * RS-232C serial interface (non-programmable) * RS-232C serial interface (programmable) * IEEE-488 interface * 256K RAM cache disk * Kanji ROM * Chinese character ROM * RGB superimposer * NTSC superimposer (occupied two expansion slots) * PAL superimposer * Battery backup Third parties also released expansion modules for the system. Third party expansions included a joystick port and a hard drive controller. The external I/O expansion port supported a self-powered enclosure that held an additional five modules, the Videotizer (a device that converted analog images to a digital format that could be manipulated), or the 16-bit Supercharger. Internally the SMC-70 had two I/O expansion bus connectors, one of which was used by the 3.5\\" floppy drive controller. With the use of the SMC-7086 Supercharger one could add a 5 MHz Intel 8086 16-bit CPU. The Supercharger also supported the addition of an Intel 8087 numeric data processor, which provided about 100 times the performance of the 8086 alone for numeric processing. The Supercharger came with a base 256 KB of RAM that was upgradable to 768K via 256K expansion boards. With the Supercharger the SMC-70 could run CP/M-86. Though Sony announced the add-on would run MS- DOS 2.11, the OS was never released outside of Sony.  Other models  The SMC-70G contains additional hardware to support video production, contains a higher wattage power supply (1.3A at 120V - 156 watts), an additional externally available expansion port (a total of four) on the expansion bus, two additional internal I/O expansion ports (used by the genlocking hardware), and an NTSC video genlocker. The SMC-70GP has a PAL video genlocker. The system interfaced with video devices (e.g. laserdisc player, videotape system) to mix computer generated graphics with live video.

In 1980 Sony announced the Series 35 word processor (OA-S3300) in the United States, which was the first product to use the technology when released in 1981. The original 3.5\\" disk (OM-D3310) created by Sony was not compatible with later 3.5\\" drives due to the coercivity of the media. Sony's drive rotated the disk at 600 RPM (versus 300 RPM of contemporary drives). The Sony disk also did not contain a spring- loaded auto shutter. The user was required to slide the protective metal sleeve on the disk to the side prior to inserting the disk into the drive. When removing the disk from the drive the metal shutter was slid to the right to protect the disk. The SSDD disks had an unformatted capacity of 437.5 Kbytes (280 Kbytes formatted) with 135 tracks per inch (70 tracks on the disk). The Sony disk drives had a transfer rate of 500 Kbps when used with DD media (250 Kbps with SD media). When the SMC-70 was released in 1982 the disk drives were capable of reading both the Sony standard disks (OM-D3310) and the future Microfloppy Industry Committee standard (though only the first 70 tracks); the disk drives had the capability of opening a spring-loaded disk shutter. Sony released an updated floppy disk based on the new standards (OM-D3320) that is compatible with both the SMC-70 and contemporary computers. Though the SMC-70 was never offered with a double sided disk drive, later releases of CP/M for the SMC-70 (e.g. 2.0) added support for double sided drives (e.g. OA-D32W), along with 40 and 80 track 5.25\\" drives. Sony released three families of 26 pin 600 RPM drives, the OA-D30V, OA-D31V, and OA-D32V/W (80 track, single/double sided). Only the OA-D30V and OA-D31V (also called MFD-31V) could read the original 3.5\\" format due to differences in magnetic coercivity. Software The system could run software designed for CP/M 2.2, though many companies released special Sony versions to support the color display (such as SuperCalc and VisiCalc).

Their logo consists of a pink and purple ribcage, which is prevalently used on promotional materials and the album covers of the untitled 4 song demo (2011), 8 song \\"Light in Darkness EP\\" (2012) and the 11 song full-length album, \\"Light in Darkness\\" (2013). Beginnings of Transparent Lead singer and songwriter, Matthew Sassano was always involved in the music and arts within church and within his local scene from a young age. A video performance on YouTube of the band Skillet inspired him to start his own band as well as a trip in October 2010, when Matthew and now band manager, Steve Cox drove out to Indiana to see a Ron Paul campaign and when they returned, they started the band. The first song written was \\"Paranoid\\". Matthew was originally just the bassist and songwriter and then just a few months later prior to doing any recording, he became the lead singer. Matthew and guitarist, Bradley are the first two original members in the band. The instrumental for \\"Paranoid\\" was originally \\"Billboard of Pain\\"'s instrumental but Matthew switched both progressions. The first batch of songs written that are on the 4 song demo: \\"Do or Die\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"NWO\\" and \\"Billboard of Pain\\" are all on the full-length CD. The 4 song demo was released in July 2011. A year later from starting the band in October 2011, Matthew went out to New Mexico to visit family and during that trip, he wrote \\"Bridges\\" (which became title track to NASCAR The Game: Inside Line) and also wrote \\"Love to Hate You\\". More songs were written and all recording for the full-length album \\"Light in Darkness\\" was completed in October 2012. Light in Darkness (first full length album) Light in Darkness is the first full-length album by the New York rock band, Transparent, which was released on June 6, 2013. The album has 11 original songs including \\"Bridges\\" (the main menu song on NASCAR The Game: Inside Line that was released on November 6, 2012), \\"Breathe\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Somewhere\\", \\"Unbreakable\\", \\"Dear God\\", \\"Love To Hate You\\", \\"March of the Damned\\", \\"Billboard of Pain\\", \\"Do or Die\\", and \\"New World Order\\". The album was recorded over the span of 2011-2012. The CD also has a booklet with artwork for each individual song, consisting of photography, collage and illustration done by band artist, Katie Cappadonia. Many of the pages were inspired by the artwork within Taylor Swift CD's because of the vivid storytelling qualities within the lyrics. Members of the band and friends of theirs were recruited to be actors within the art. Debut on NASCAR video game with \\"Bridges\\" The song \\"Bridges\\" was written by lead singer, Matthew Sassano during October 2011 while he was on a trip to New Mexico. He also wrote \\"Love to Hate You\\" during the trip too. \\"Bridges\\" is based on the prodigal son in the Bible. The song almost got thrown out initially because of the drum interpretation by a previous drummer before Jesse Sprinkle. The song has received many positive reviews by online blogs and magazines such as Fabryka and Underground Uproar. \\"Bridges\\" also became the main menu song on NASCAR The Game: Inside Line for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii. The previous year on the NASCAR game, the main menu song was from ZZ Top. During the summer and fall of 2012, Alfred State College Digital Media Animation students made the music video for Transparent's first single \\"Bridges\\" which is the main menu song on NASCAR The Game: Inside Line. The music video director was Jeremy Schwartz, a professor for the Digital Media Department and has worked on Robot Chicken on Cartoon Network. The video has a sort of stop- motion appeal to it with a drawn out, watercolor effect to give it a sort of surrealistic look. The students who made the video made a snow mountain background within the film by setting up rocks, putting powder on them, and then give it a close-up shot with a blurred effect, making it blend with the rest of the background. The effect added to the hills were made in Adobe Photoshop; and composite images of different backdrops within another photo of a hill. The smoke was created by liquid dynamics, experimenting with food coloring, alcohol, milk, and paint. There were many different storyboards and sketches, displaying character placement, the frames used, sketched out effects, and subtitles explaining the scene and how it was made. The effects used to place a background behind the characters was made with the use of the green screen and chroma keying. Over 6,000 frames were used within the project of the band posing in front of a green-screen. The backgrounds in the video are all photos that came from Alfred, New York or the Finger Lakes Region. The music video can be seen on YouTube and is available for sale on iTunes. Originally, their song \\"New World Order\\" was supposed to be the song on the game but was switched out for \\"Bridges\\". https://archive.is/20130217013934/http://dullko.wordpress.com/2012/11/26/lectureart- gallery-3-transparent-music-video/ http://lraewilson.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/bridges-gallery-opening-set/ References http://www.eveningtribune.com/article/20131125/NEWS/131129789 https://web.archive.org/web/20121229002814/http://www.eveningtribune.com/news/x35739744/Local- band-s-song-featured-on-new-video-game https://archive.is/20130122155601/http://www.eveningtribune.com/news/x137170794/Local- band-s-song-featured-in-video-game https://www.facebook.com/transparentband/info http://www.biogamergirl.com/2012/11/closer-look-into-transparent-light-in.html WENY TV interview http://www.weny.com/news/local-news/localbandgoesnational http://www.last.fm/user/fabrykamagazine/journal/2012/05/05/5gbwcp_transparent_- _bridges_-_song_review_2011_nu_metal_alternative_rock https://plus.google.com/u/0/110672807017683277156/posts/eJs13cdVkfv https://archive.is/20130217013934/http://dullko.wordpress.com/2012/11/26/lectureart- gallery-3-transparent-music-video/ http://www.1776again.com/ok-i-had-to-make- a-post-about-the-band-transparent/ Underground Uproar Interview https://m.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=328696563856687&_ft_=fbid.327847917278569&_rdr https://www.youtube.com/transparentrockband http://www.transparentrockband.com External links * Official website * Official YouTube * Picture 1 Category:Rock music groups from New York (state) Category:Alternative rock groups from New York (state) Category:American Christian rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2010 Category:Hornell, New York ","title":"Transparent (New York rock band)"},{"id":"37939315","text":"Sjursnes is a village in Troms√∏ Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.

History Peter the Great was bred by D. D. Streeter at The Oaklands, Kalamazoo, Michigan. At the age of two years he was trained by Peter V. Johnston. Stableman Jud Graine stated that Peter the Great was \\"Spirited and gentle as a kitten ... He was wise ... That is one reason his offspring were such great horses.\\" Peter the Great did not have a name until the last hours before the Kentucky Futurity's posting time. In 1898, Peter the Great was sold to J. Malcolm Forbes who was from near Boston, Massachusetts. Peter The Great was directly put into service on Forbes Farm in Massachusetts. Henry Titer trained him for racing. From 1901 and on, he was solely used at stud. Peter the Great entered the sale ring at Madison Square Garden, New York, in 1903. Peter Duryea (New York) and E. D. Stokes bought him. They sent him to serve on Patchen Wilkes Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. From 1908 Peter Duryea owned Peter the Great. In 1916 he changed owners again, moving to Stoughton Fletcher and Tom Taggart, who lived in Indianapolis, Indiana. They placed him at Forkland Farm, Kentucky, for two seasons. Thereafter, he lived at Laurel Hall Farm, Indianapolis in a special barn. It looked like a summer cottage with a padded floor. He is buried at Tom Taggart's residence near French Lick, Indiana. In 1928, the ashes of his groom, Jacob Councilman, were spread on his grave. In honor of Peter the Great, a monument was erected. In 1997 it was revitalized and later relocated to a wooded area near the West Baden Hotel, West Baden, Indiana. The inscription read: \\"By sheer merit he lifted his name to the head of all trotting progenitors. Death left him unrivaled by one of his own breed regardless of era, age, or breeding.\\" Appearance Peter the Great was 15.3 hands at the withers, 15.2 at the hips, and 16.1 hands long. His nose had a slight Roman tendency. His ears were wide at the base, the eyes large and full of expression. The neck was long, with somewhat upright shoulders. His croup was long, wide and well muscled. His color was chestnut. He had a white star on his forehead and on the left hind leg a white sock.Berry, Barbara J. (1979). \\"The Standardbreds\\".

It was first released in 2012 as a Record Store Day exclusive ‚Äì a vinyl double LP in a limited number of 2,200 copies. The show was recorded directly off the mixing desk by fans who, with foreknowledge of Mick Jones' plans to attend, anticipated some kind of onstage reunion of the former Clash songwriting partners. The recording circulated for many years just amongst a small group of fans who knew of its existence before surfacing a decade later at Hellcat Records. The concert, a benefit for striking firefighters, was recorded on 15 November 2002 and features one of the final live performances by Strummer (the last live show being in Liverpool on 22 November 2002), who died due to a heart condition on 22 December 2002. The performance features songs Strummer recorded with The Clash along with songs from Strummer's albums for Hellcat Records including new written songs such as \\"Coma Girl\\" and \\"Get Down Moses\\" that eventually would appear on Strummer's posthumous album, Streetcore.

It opened in 1939 to train candidates for the Congregation of the Mission, commonly called the Vincentian Fathers, and operated until 1990. The facilities then served as a retreat center. History In 1912, the Vincentians made the decision to build a school of theology for candidates to their community based in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Prefect of the Vincentian minor seminary, the Rev. Joseph A. Skelly, C.M., was asked to dedicate his time to raising funds for the building of a new seminary. As a result of his labors, in 1936 the Congregation acquired a 460-acre tract of grassy fields and wooded land, at the highest point in Lehigh Township, near the palisades of the Lehigh River, about 12 miles north of Allentown within the Diocese of Allentown. Construction began in 1938 and the cornerstone was blessed that year in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal Dennis Joseph Dougherty, the Archbishop of Philadelphia. The service was attended by 15,000 people. The seminary held its first classes in the fall of 1939. The member of the first class were ordained after graduating the following spring. The seminary continued to serve the Eastern Province of the Congregation until 1969. By that time, the number of candidates to the Vincentian Fathers had dropped to such a point that the seminary was opened to students for dioceses of the region and other religious institutes. The last class graduated in 1990, the 50th class to have done so. The seminary had trained some 500 men for the priesthood by that time. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia began to make use of the facilities for its own seminarians. In 1996 the Vincentian Fathers sold the property to the Archdiocese. At that time it was converted into use as a retreat center. The buildings Chapel In 1954 the Chapel of Mary Queen of all Saints was opened for worship by the Vincentian community. The chapel was built in the form of a cross composed of the nave and the transept, with a semi-circular apse around the altar. The Vincentian Fathers and seminarians sat in choir stalls of white oak, with stone work of white Indiana limestone, ornamented in places with carved inscriptions. It contains a shrine to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. The stone work in the shrine is of Kentucky sandstone. The architectural style of the chapel is a fusion and adaptation of ancient forms. The exterior was done in the Romanesque style, and the interior uses the Roman barrel vault for the nave. The dome of the apse, directly above the main altar, was done in a Byzantine style. The apse dome features a tile mosaic executed by Hildreth Meiere in the Art Deco style depicting Our Lady surrounded by six saints who were known for a strong devotion to her. They are: * St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscans * St. Dominic, O.P., holding a book * St. Alphonsus Maria de Liguori, founder of the Redemptorists, with a monstrance * St. Bernard of Clairvaux, O.Cist, monk and spiritual writer * St. Simon Stock, O.Carm, initiator of the scapular devotion * St. Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows, C.P. The tabernacle is not marble, as is commonly used, but made of white onyx. The crucifix has the body of Jesus in ivory-colored linden wood, which stands out from the darker tones of the zebrawood cross, with its edging and trim done in sheet copper. Tower The complex includes a tower that dominates the front of the main building and which features the crucifixion. In its foyer, mosaics depict the life and works of St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the Vincentians, and notable members of the Congregation. Sayings of Vincent de Paul are sculpted into the stone.

The exterior walls were constructed of locally quarried blue limestone with a tawny colored sandstone quarried from Warrensburg, Missouri. The interior walls were faced with buff brick from the Peerless Brick Company of Philadelphia, among other materials. The original roof was made of red slate. The congregation's first pastor William Greenleaf Eliot initially proposed its construction in January 1877 and commissioned Peabody & Stearns in 1878. The congregation purchased the plot of land in 1879. Ground was broken in November 1879, and the cornerstone laid February 1, 1880. The first service was held on December 26, 1880 with the official dedication on December 16, 1881. It designated a St. Louis City Landmark in 1977 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. A fire in January 1982 caused by squatters living in a basement storage room gutted the structure, leading to its eventual demolition in 1987.

The elapsed time is roughly one relaxation time. The dashed line shows the steady-state density profile. Bahcall‚ÄìWolf cusp refers to a particular distribution of stars around a massive black hole at the center of a galaxy or globular cluster. If the nucleus containing the black hole is sufficiently old, exchange of orbital energy between stars drives their distribution toward a characteristic form, such that the density of stars, œÅ, varies with distance from the black hole, r, as : \\\\rho(r) \\\\propto r^{-7/4} . So far, no clear example of a Bahcall‚ÄìWolf cusp has been found in any galaxy or star cluster. This may be due in part to the difficulty of resolving such a feature. Distribution of stars around a supermassive black hole Supermassive black holes reside in galactic nuclei. The total mass of the stars in a nucleus is roughly equal to the mass of the supermassive black hole. In the case of the Milky Way, the mass of the supermassive black hole is about 4 million Solar masses, and the number of stars in the nucleus is about ten million. The stars move around the supermassive black hole in elliptical orbits, similar to the orbits that planets follow around the Sun. The orbital energy of a star is : E = \\\\boldsymbol{v}^2/2 - GM/r where v is the star's velocity, r is its distance from the supermassive black hole, and M is the supermassive black hole's mass. A star's energy remains nearly constant for many orbital periods. But after roughly one relaxation time, most of the stars in the nucleus will have exchanged energy with other stars, causing their orbits to change. Bahcall and Wolf showed that once this has taken place, the distribution of orbital energies has the form : N(E)\\\\, dE = N_0 E^{-9/4} dE, which corresponds to the density œÅ=œÅ0 r ‚àí7/4. The figure shows how the density of stars evolves toward the Bahcall‚ÄìWolf form. The fully formed cuspThe term \\"cusp\\" refers to the fact that a graph of density vs. radius has a cuspy appearance if plotted on linear axes, rather than the logarithmic axes used in the figure. extends outward to a distance of roughly one-fifth the supermassive black hole's influence radius. It is believed that relaxation times in the nuclei of small, dense galaxies are short enough for Bahcall‚ÄìWolf cusps to form. The Galactic Center The influence radius of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center is about 2‚Äì3 parsecs (pc), and a Bahcall‚ÄìWolf cusp if present would extend outward to a distance of about 0.5 pc from the supermassive black hole. A region of this size is easily resolved from Earth. However, no cusp is observed; instead, the density of the oldest stars is flat or even declining toward the Galactic Center. This observation does not necessarily rule out the existence of a Bahcall‚ÄìWolf cusp in some still unobserved component. However, current observations imply a relaxation time at the Galactic Center of roughly 10 billion years, comparable with the age of the Milky Way. It is therefore likely that not enough time has elapsed for a Bahcall‚ÄìWolf cusp to form. Alternatively, some process may have destroyed the bright stars near the supermassive black hole. Multi-mass cusps The Bahcall‚ÄìWolf solution applies to a nucleus consisting of stars of a single mass. If there is a range of masses, each component will have a different density profile. There are two limiting cases. If the more massive stars dominate the total density, their density will follow the Bahcall‚ÄìWolf form, whereas the less-massive objects will have œÅ \\\\propto r‚àí3/2. If the less massive stars dominate the total density, their density will follow the Bahcall‚ÄìWolf form, whereas the more-massive stars will follow œÅ \\\\propto r‚àí2. In an old stellar population, most of the mass is either in the form of main- sequence stars, with masses \\\\lesssim 1‚Äì2 Solar masses, or in black hole remnants, with masses ~ 10‚Äì20 Solar masses. It is likely that the main- sequence stars dominate the total density; so their density should follow the Bahcall‚ÄìWolf form whereas the black holes should have the steeper, œÅ ~ r‚àí2 profile. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the distribution of stellar masses at the Galactic Center is \\"top-heavy\\", with a much larger fraction of black holes. If this is the case, the observed stars would be expected to attain the shallower density profile, œÅ ~ r‚àí3/2. However, even this shallower profile is probably inconsistent with what is observed at the Galactic Center, implying that a Bahcall‚ÄìWolf cusp never formed. The number and distribution of black hole remnants at the Galactic Center is very poorly constrained.

It has particular significance for how one may interpret the nature of the quantum state. With respect to certain realist hidden variable theories that attempt to explain the predictions of quantum mechanics, the theorem rules that pure quantum states must be \\"ontic\\" in the sense that they correspond directly to states of reality, rather than \\"epistemic\\" in the sense that they represent probabilistic or incomplete states of knowledge about reality. The PBR theorem may also be compared with other no-go theorems like Bell's theorem and the Bell‚ÄìKochen‚ÄìSpecker theorem, which, respectively, rule out the possibility of explaining the predictions of quantum mechanics with local hidden variable theories and noncontextual hidden variable theories. Similarly, the PBR theorem could be said to rule out preparation independent hidden variable theories, in which quantum states that are prepared independently have independent hidden variable descriptions. This result was cited by theoretical physicist Antony Valentini as \\"the most important general theorem relating to the foundations of quantum mechanics since Bell's theorem\\".  Theorem  This theorem, which first appeared as an arXiv preprint and was subsequently published in Nature Physics, concerns the interpretational status of pure quantum states.

The group consisted of six Salvation Army soldiers.  Career   Eurovision Song Contest 2013  The band, originally named 'Heilsarmee', participated in the Swiss national final with the song \\"You and Me\\". They qualified to the national final through the online selection organized by SF. On 15 December 2012, they won the Swiss national final, therefore they represented Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. On 17 December 2012, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that the band would not be permitted to compete under the name 'Heilsarmee' (German for 'Salvation Army') at the Eurovision Song Contest, in accordance with the rules of the contest forbidding political and religious content. In March 2013, the group announced that they would be known as 'Takasa' for the contest; officially, the name was taken from the Swahili verb \\"to purify,\\" but it has been noted to be an acronym of \\"The Artists Known As Salvation Army\\" (an allusion to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince). This is also similar to the time when the Sex Pistols toured under the name 'Spots' (Sex Pistols On Tour, Secretly.) The members of the band have a major age difference as the oldest member, bassist Emil Ramsauer, was 95 (born 1918), and their youngest member, singer Sarah Breiter, was 22 (born 1991), at the time of their Eurovision performance. The band also wore different outfits for Eurovision, barred from wearing Salvation Army uniforms by the same rules. Subsequent career and dissolution After their Eurovision appearance, the group performed only a few more times at local events in Switzerland. By 2015, according to Christoph Jakob, the group had ceased to exist, because the other professional responsibilities of its members made its continuance impractical. In 2018, Ramsauer became the first Eurovision artist to turn 100 years of age, and on February 28, 2020, he celebrated his 102nd birthday.

Since 1884, Spain claimed the land of Western Sahara (also known as Spanish Sahara) and administered it until 1975.Encyclopedia Britannica: Western Sahara In November 1975, Spain agreed to partition part of the territory to Morocco and to Mauritania after it was agreed at the Madrid Accords. That same month, 350,000 Moroccans and 20,000 Moroccan troops held the ‚ÄúGreen March‚Äù into Spanish Sahara to force Spain to hand over the disputed territory. Spain soon withdrew from the territory.

Kent Gordon at the California Institute of Technology. Description The following description is taken from the original TTM reference manual and the subsequent batch processing extension. TTM Is a recursive, interpretive language designed primarily for string manipulation, text editing, macro definition and expansion, and other applications generally classified as systems programming. It is derived, primarily, from GAPFarber, D. J., 635 Assembly System - GAP. Bell Telephone Laboratories Computation Center (1964). and GPM.Strachey, C., A General Purpose Macro Generator. Comput J 8, 3(1965), pp. 225-241. Initially, TTM was planned as the macro processing portion of an assembler for the IBM System/360 and, as such, was designed to overcome the restrictions and inconsistencies which existed in the standard assemblers for that system.IBM, System/360 Assembler Language, C28-6514-4, (1967).Caine, S.H. et al., Report of the Systems Objectives and Requirements Committee, SHARE, 1965, pp. 29-40. In addition, it was designed to have all of the power possessed by earlier general macro assemblers but with the unfortunate syntactic and semantic difficulties removed.Eastwood, D.E. and McIlroy, M.D., Macro Compiler Modification of SAP. Bell Telephone Laboratories omputation Center, 1959.McClure, R.M., Description of CODAPT Assembler, 1960.Caine, S.H., Reference Manual for CIT 7090/7040 Experimental Macro Assembly Program (XMAP). California Institute of Technology, Willis H. Booth Computing Center (1964).McIlroy, M.D., Macro Instruction Extensions of Compiler Languages. CACM 3, No. 4 (1960), 214-220. During the development of TTM, it became apparent that applications other than assembler macro processing were possible. These include data editing, text manipulation, expression compiling, and macro processing for language processors other than assemblers. The initial version of TTM was implemented to run in a conversational manner under the Caltech Basic Time Sharing System for the IBM System/360 Model 50.Caine, S.H., et al., An Operating Environment for Programming Research. California Institute of Technology, Willis H. Booth Computing Center Programming Report No. 1, 1967. Other versions have been written to run in the batch processing environment of OS/360 and to operate in front of or in conjunction with various language processors. Syntax and Semantics The reference implementation assumes that TTM is given a text file containing some combination of ordinary text and TTM function calls (i.e. invocations). The text is scanned character by character. Any ordinary text is passed to the output unchanged (except for escapes). If a TTM function is encountered, it is collected and executed. The general form of a TTM function call looks like this # where the function name and the arguments are arbitrary character strings not containing characters of significance: '#', '<', '>', and ';'. The function is invoked with the specified arguments and the resulting text is inserted into the original text in place of the function call. If the function call was prefixed by a single '#' character, then scanning will resume just before the inserted text from the function call. This is called active invocation. If the function call was prefixed by two '#' characters, then scanning resumes just after the inserted text. This is called passive invocation. During the collection of a function call, additional function calls may be encountered, for example, this. #;...;argn> The nested function call will be invoked when encountered and the result inserted into the text of the outer function call and scanning of the outer function call resumes at the place indicated by the number of '#' characters preceding the nested call. If a function takes, for example, 2 arguments, any extras are ignored. For user defined functions, if too few arguments are provided, additional one are added with the value of the empty string (\\"\\"). A function may have a maximum of 62 arguments. As with other applicative programming languages, a TTM function may be recursive and may be defined as the result of the invocation of a sequence of other function calls. Functions are either built-in or user defined. A large number of built-in functions exist and are defined in the TTM reference manual Function definition User defined functions are created using the following two built-in functions. * # * # The first function, ds for \\"define string\\", defines a named string in the TTM dictionary. The name is \\"name\\" and its value is \\"text\\". Invoking this named string will cause its invocation to be replaced by the value (i.e. \\"text\\"). The second function, ss for \\"segment string\\", scans the text of a previously defined string looking for occurrences of its arguments: text1, text2, ... textn. When an occurrence is found, it is replaced with a segment mark. All occurrences of each argument are replaced by the same segment mark. When a segmented string is invoked, each argument to the call is substituted for the corresponding segment mark. Consider this example. [01] # [02] # [03] # The string F is defined (line 1) and its body \\"abcxxdefyy\\" is segmented on the two strings \\"xx\\" and \\"yy\\" (line2). When invoked (line 3), it will return the value \\"abc11def22\\". In effect, we have a user defined function F with two arguments. Escaping It is possible to escape one or more characters using either of two conventions. # <...> - escape multiple characters. # @ - escape a single character If a string is enclosed in <...>, then it is scanned but not interpreted by TTM. In the scanning process, the outer < and > brackets are removed. If there are nested occurrences of <...>, then they are scanned but the < and > are not removed. The brackets must balance: the number of '<' characters must equal the number of '>' characters. The '@' escape convention causes the interpreter to pass as-is the character after the '@'. The leading '@' is left if it within a <...> escape sequence, otherwise it is removed. One use is to allow unbalanced occurrences of '<' or '>' characters. Examples Example 1: Function Definition The most basic example involves defining a function that is useful for defining additional functions. This \\"meta\\" function is called def. It is written as: #>;##>> # We can, for example, use def to define the string XX as 12345 and then segment XX on 34 by writing this. # The call # will then produce the string \\"1200005\\". The def function operates by invoking ds to define the function name and initial text in the TTM dictionary ‚Äì XX in our example. Then the text of the dictionary entry of XX is segmented with respect to any specified arguments: \\"34\\" in this case. When XX is invoked, its argument is substituted for the segment mark. Example 2: Factorial The factorial function can be defined (using the above ## function) as follows. #>>>>>> Notice that the inner computation (#<mu...) is escaped so it will only be evaluated after the #<lt... functions is executed and returns that nested computation as its result. An example call would look like this. # and would return the string 6. See also * TRAC programming language The exact relationship between TTM and TRAC is unknown. The TTM documentation indicates that it was derived from GAP and GPM. In any case, the description of the characteristics of TRAC also apply to TTM. However, by removing the syntactic distinction between built-in and user-defined function, TTM would appear to be a much cleaner language.

Since 1957 De Smet took an interest in Esperanto. He was a well-known figure in the local, Flemish kaj international Esperanto-movement. In this connection he published a text-book for self-study in 1982. He was the main initiator of the idea for coming off the 67-nd World Congress of Esperanto in Antwerp. Because of an Esperanto written contribution, De Smet earned the UMEA-award in Japan. De Smet was a full member of the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj (AIS) of San Marino, since the foundation of this academy. New Biological Nomenclature During his career daily confronted with the imperfections of the existing zoological nomenclature, already in the 1950s De Smet began developing an entirely new concept, without distinction between animals or plants, even with the possibility of housing the bacteria into the system. Translating the existing names into Esperanto is not the point, but a simplification, modernization and better handling of the ancient respectable Systema naturae. One of the aims was limiting the number of names, for example by elimination of the names of the genera. De Smet defined \\"New Biological Nomenclature\\" as follows:De Smet 1973, p.2 New Biological Nomenclature is NOT : the naming of animals and plants into Esperanto. But it IS : a new nomenclature-system that relies on new ideas and that uses Esperanto for its names. New Biological Nomencalature (N.B.N.) is a system : * which can be used in parallel with the nomenclature of Linnaeus, and without hampering it; * which forms names in a logical manner; * which relies on the present-day knowledge of biology; * which is not troubled by obsolete traditions in nomenclature; * which allows finding the position of a species in the whole of living things; * which employs names that are easily to commit to memory and to pronounce; * which introduces a new definition of \\"type\\"; * which gives new chances for the taxonomists to lay out new collections and to select in them their N.B.N.-types; * which applies for enthusiasm and collaboration of a lot of people in order to propose N.B.N.-names; * which warrants efficiency.

Design and development During the 1920s Fiat introduced several water-cooled aircraft engines, including the A.20, A.22, A24, A.25 and A.30. They were all upright V-12s with 60¬∞ between the cylinder banks; capacities ranged between 18.7 L and 54.5 L (1,141-3,324 cu in) and power outputs between 320 kW and 745 kW (430-1,000 hp). Producing 710 kW (950 hp) from 54.5 L (3,324 cu in), the A.25 was the largest and most powerful in the range. When Fiat were advised by the government to simplify their water-cooled product line, they focussed on the A.20, A.22 and A.30 models, so the A.25 was not further developed.

Its heart is the Hanoverian Wendland in the county of L√ºchow-Dannenberg in Lower Saxony. In 2012 the state of Lower Saxony nominated the Rundling villages in Hanoverian Wendland for the German shortlist of candidates for future UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Subsequent decisions that will determine the success of this bid take place in 2013 at the conference of education ministers (Kultusministerkonferenz) and no earlier than 2017 by UNESCO.Wer wird Welterbe? in: Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung dated 18 June 2012  Name  Wendland is not an ancient regional name. The term was first used around 1700, when a priest from Wustrow wrote about the language, habits, customs and manners of the Polabian inhabitants of this area. He viewed the people in the Dannenberg districts as Wends and so named the region the Wendland. Over the course of time the name stuck. The term Vendland was used for the regions east of L√ºbeck, however, by the Scandinavian peoples since at least before the turn of the 10th Century. One recorded historic instance is when King Olaf I of Norway in 982 married Queen Geira, a daughter of King Burizleif of Vendland.  Landscape  In the west the partially wooded Drawehn ridge dominates the Hanoverian Wendland; view from the Hoher Mechtin The L√ºchower Landgraben and Grenzgraben depressions separate the Wendland in the south from the Altmark; view over the Fl√∂tgraben of Lemgow Geographically the western Wendland is also the eastern edge of the L√ºneburg Heath, its appearance shaped during the Saale glaciation. Here the countryside is dominated by the ridge of the Drawehn, which is a gravelly, east Hanoverian terminal moraine. It is thus a sandy geest terrain, afforested with pines. With infertile soils and a scarcity of water as a result of the porous soil it was always historically a hostile environment for settlers. The largest part of the Hanoverian Wendland, however, lies in the glacial meltwater valley (Urstromtal) of the River Elbe. A distinction here needs to be made between the actual flood plain of the Elbe in the north and the L√ºchow Depression. The latter is a lower terrace, crossed by numerous streams - the largest being the Jeetzel ‚Äì canals and ditches. Low hills are formed by small, island-like ground moraines like √ñring, Lemgow, Langendorfer Geestinsel and H√∂hbeck. In the east the Gartow Forest stands on a large plain of wind-borne sand (see also: Wendland and Altmark).  Culture and history  The Wendland is heavily influenced by the Polabian culture. In the Middle Ages, and in places up to the Early Modern Period, the Wendland was inhabited by Slavs, who were known as Wends in the German-speaking world. As a result there are numerous place names that have Slavic origins, as well as circular villages of the Rundling type that emerged during times of conflict in the medieval period. The Slavic language of the Wendlanders, the Draveno- Polabian, died out in 1756. Until then, the Wendland was the westernmost point of the Slavic language region. Until the Wende in 1989/90, the Wendland was a border zone that extended like a salient into East German territory. Since the end of the 1970s it has become renown outside the region for protests against the atomic waste depot at Gorleben and the call for the so-called Free Republic of Wendland in 1980 - a protest camp that was later cleared by police. Since 1989, a cultural festival, the Kulturelle Landpartie, has taken place in the Wendland annually between Ascension Day and Pentecost. It is one of the biggest cultural events in Germany.  Types of settlement  View of the rundling village of Satemin, 3 kilometres west of L√ºchow In Hanoverian Wendland, a distinctive type of historic circular village, known as the Rundling, is common even today. Almost all Rundlinge still bear village names of Slavic origin. This type of settlement occurred in regions from the Baltic Sea to the Ore Mountains, but has only survived in its original form in any numbers in the Wendland due to the relative isolation of the region since the Middle Ages and its distance from the main trading routes. Over 100 villages in the area still preserve the characteristic appearance of a Rundling. But similar villages called by other names such as Runddorf or Platzdorf or Rundangerdorf occur in significant numbers in neighbouring Altmark as well as the eastern parts of the counties of L√ºneburg, Uelzen, Gifhorn and in the south on the Vorsfelder Werder (R√ºhen, Wendschott, Brackstedt, Velstove) and some parts of Schleswig-Holstein. However, unlike those in the Hanoverian Wendland, they have been greatly modified. And fewer of their historic farmhouses have survived, because in other regions with better economic conditions, new buildings replaced the old.  Shortlisting for World Heritage status  The Rundling villages of the Hanoverian Wendland were nominated in 2012 by the state of Lower Saxony as a cultural landscape for the German shortlist of candidates for future UNESCO World Heritage Sites. On 18 June 2012, the Lower Saxon Ministry of Science and Culture (Nieders√§chsisches Ministerium f√ºr Wissenschaft und Kultur) announced its decision following a selection process that had started in 2011. The conference of cultural ministers (Kultusministerkonferenz) will decide in 2013 which entries from Germany's federal states will be placed on a shortlist, from which UNESCO will choose new world heritage sites in 2017.Pressemitteilung: ‚ÄûAltes Land‚Äú und ‚ÄûRundlingsd√∂rfer des Hannoverschen Wendlandes‚Äú werden f√ºr die deutsche Tentativliste gemeldet by the Lower Saxon Ministry of Science and Culture dated 18 June 2012 The original bid was based on 15 Rundling villages chosen to represent a selection of highly distinctive high medieval colonisation settlements in the county of L√ºchow-Dannenberg. Since then the bid has been modified to encompass the landscape between the villages, and 19 villages have been provisionally chosen to represent the best of the Rundlingslandschaft. The uniqueness of these circular villages stems from their combination of a distinctive ground plan, a high density of Low German hall houses with their gable ends facing a central green as well as the fact that their houses represent a regionally specific variation of this type of farmhouse. The state of Lower Saxony hopes that the bid will prove successful because these circular villages are among the most unrepresented categories of cultural landscapes and farming architecture in the UNESCO's world heritage list.

This masjid has been renamed in the 21st century as Killarpul Shahi Jame Masjid. History In principle there are two major assumptions by the historians on the person who sanctioned the Masjid construction and history of its evolution. With respect to the first assumption one concerned source suggests that Nawab Shaista Khan, the Mughal Subahdar of Bengal who was active between 1664 and 1688 built it in a fortified complex in the early 1680s. Nawab Shaista Khan is presumed to be Bibi Maryam's father by this source who named it as token of affection for her daughter after her premature demise and enshrined her in the complex. Meanwhile, the other piece of assumption advocates that Bibi Maryam was actually wife of IshaKha Masnad-E- Ala who built both the masjid and the shrine in the aftermath of her death. The former opinion is much more concrete than the latter since the masjid architecture is absolutely that of Mughal style. It is also justified by the historians who have examined the used building materials and applied construction techniques to learn that both were exercised during the age of Nawab Shaista Khan's existence. However this masjid has been acknowledged as one of the prominent surviving Mughal buildings in Bangladesh despite its limited accommodation. According to the present masjid authority during its construction only members of both Nawab Shaista Khan's family and administration formed the Muslim population of the present day Killarpul area it is situated in. Even as late as the 1950s Hindus almost monopolised the area population where hardly ten people would appear for the congregational prayer in stark contrast to the daily hundreds of worshipers who appear for any prayer.  Architectural elements and style  Originally it was built as a usually and extremely tall single-storied masjid with great emphasis of the vertical qualities where the three mihrabs located in the western wall stood from the base of the ground floor to one-third the height of the first floor. These mihrabs have been compressed in width and shortened in height; otherwise, they would structurally relate to the three domes to portray one of the masjid's prime architectural essences. The remains of the authentic mihrabs are present in the first floor and rise as much as one-third of its height in the western wall. In 2001 the first floor was inserted directly in the Masjid, which all but jeopardised the structural beauty defined by the relationship between the domes and the mihrabs. After the construction of the first floor, the beauty of the domes and mihrabs remain undecipherable where the former's view is completely obstructed by the roof of the first floor and the latter's size has been greatly altered. The architecture of the Bibi Maryam Masjid is defined by a combination of embellishments and proportional adjustment among elements such as arches, domes, mihrabs etc., all which have been used in a series of three members. In such elements the middle one is much larger and more emphasised than those that flank it. For instance the interior space was roofed by the three domes where the central dome is much larger than the subsidiary ones located at its either side. In masjids the use of three domes in such manner is a very distinctive feature of Mughal style. The three domes which were constructed in the 17th century The three mihrabs at the western facade There is a tower called minaret in Arabic situated at the eastern corner of the main building which was built during the 1971 Liberation War and has lost its authentic features due to later repairs which completely modernised it. The interior hall has simple lateral arches, but the side domes have been reduced in size by adjusting the thickness of the side walls. The three domes are embellished with basal leaf imitations and the masjid walls are fortified. The embellishment of the outer surfaces or walls which in the contemporary typical Mughal masjids were plaques and floral and geometric motifs are also untraceable. A veranda has been later added alongside the first floor due the eastern facade of the masjid to accommodate more number of worshipers which has marred the beauty of the masjid. Originally there was an open plaza that adjoined the eastern facade adding to its beauty and measured 50 feet by 20 feet. The masjid even though is rectangular in shape but looked more of a square where the 50 feet width is marginally bigger than its 45 feet breadth. Relationship with the complex The historical records clarify that the fortified complex existed prior to both the simultaneously constructed masjid and shrine it houses. This complex is entirely fortified with 4-foot-wide and 12-foot-high boundary walls where the prime building is the Bibi Maryam Shrine. The masjid faces the shrine located exactly opposite to it and its central axis is aligned with that of the shrine.This is the shrine of Bibi Maryam The masjid was built simultaneously with the shrine to fulfill the need for congregational prayer and secondly to complement the significance of the shrine by availing the scope for worshipers to pray for the deceased Bibi Maryam's salvation. This shrine leads to a subsidiary shrine and located at the western end of the Masjid is a secret passage by which Nawab Shaista Khan's soldiers could access the Hajiganj Fort. The rectangle-shaped Bibi Maryam shrine is accessible from all directions with five arches on all its facades and is topped by a dome. Unlike the Bibi Maryam Masjid the shrine has retained all its architectural qualities despite undergoing conservation numerous times.This unit was used as dwelling of the guards It reflects the age during which it was built. After 1971 Liberation war substantial area of the Bibi Maryam complex has been consumed by Bibi Maryam Girls Primary School, for which a large part of the eastern and southern fortifications had to be demolished. The shrines and the masjid are located on elevated surfaces. Another building is located adjoining the fortified walls at the southern direction, which was the dwelling of the Nawab's soldiers who guarded the complex. The main shrine is a monochromatic structure plastered with light-brown surfaces and adorned with recessed rectangular panels. The parapet of the shrine is decorated in the same style as the top of the fortified boundary walls. It is presented with a set of three arches in the middle flanked at the right and left sides by a single arch of identical size and features. The shrine has been built on an elevated platform which measures three feet high and is accessed by a recessed staircase whose appearance is absolutely ruined. Mughal embellishments of the Masjid Although the plaques and motifs which adorned the Bibi Maryam Masjid disappeared long ago, still the themes can be deduced by analysing those still preserved in the shrine and other buildings of the complex. Some of the embellishments were produced as patterns of voids and minute angular shapes by piercing the walls directly. The other elements are basically projected or recessed rectangular plaques and floral and geometric motifs. The latter types also enhance the incident natural lighting in buildings both for comfort and aesthetic purposes. This strategy has been commonly employed in Islamic architecture and is strongly featured in the shrine and subsidiary shrine. But, unlike the shrine, it has transformed radically under the different conservation and construction phases. The Masjid stands with completely deprivation of its true architectural significance. Several books have been written to unravel its wonders albeit with limited hypothetical conclusions and are oriented more towards sensitivity of its values. The scarcity of the information is attributed to its faint documentation in the context of history and irresponsibility of the government in treating it as a national heritage. However, it is not absolutely dilapidated, since a lot can be traced from the surviving elements such as domes, arches and load-bearing walls that defined the space in its inception.

Starting her career in the Gatokunyan promotion in 2005, Haruhi remained with the promotion for two years, before transferring over to Pro Wrestling Wave in 2008. While in the promotion, she has become a one-time holder of the Asia Pacific Women's, Garter Match and TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championships and a three-time holder of the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship, a title owned by the DDT Pro-Wrestling promotion. None of the three other titles are major titles, often remaining inactive for months or even years. She also works for Wave's sister promotion Osaka Joshi Pro Wrestling as . \\"Moeka Haruhi\\" is not her real name, but rather a stage name highlighting her cutesy, cosplaying persona. Professional wrestling career Gatokunyan (2005‚Äì2007) After a career modeling in Japanese teen fashion magazines, Haruhi decided to find a new career in professional wrestling. After a stint training under Taka Michinoku at his Kaientai Dojo promotion, Haruhi entered the Gatokunyan promotion, where she was trained by Emi Sakura. She eventually made her debut on February 13, 2005, in a match against Rika Takahashi in Itabashi, Tokyo. Haruhi's wrestling character was based on her real-life love of cosplaying. Continuing to work for Gatokunyan, Haruhi quickly went on to form a tag team with Mai Ichii, while also continuing to model, releasing a photobook. On March 13, Haruhi made her debut for NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling, losing to Ichii in a \\"Gatokunyan Showcase\\" match. The following September, Haruhi was appointed the head of the Gatokunyan's public relations. In mid-2006, when Emi Sakura left Gatokunyan to form Ice Ribbon, taking many of her trainees with her, Haruhi remained affiliated with Gatokunyan, but also made several appearances for Ice Ribbon, including working the promotion's second ever show on June 20, 2006, during which she was defeated by Kaoru Ito. On July 30, 2006, Haruhi earned the first win of her career by pinning Sakura at a Gatokunyan event. During 2006, Haruhi also made several appearances for the JDStar promotion, including taking part in the 2006 League Princess tournament. Haruhi remained with Gatokunyan until January 2007, when she left the struggling promotion, which folded shortly afterwards. Pro Wrestling Wave (2008‚Äìpresent) After leaving Gatokunyan, Haruhi remained inactive from in-ring competition for over a year, while she underwent further training under veteran wrestler Toshie Uematsu. Having signed an exclusive contract with Pro Wrestling Wave, the promotion announced on February 25, 2008, that Haruhi was ready to make her return to wrestling. The return match took place on March 12, 2008, and saw Haruhi and Uematsu lose to the JWP Joshi Puroresu team of Azumi Hyuga and Mayuka Niizeki in a tag team match. During the following months, Haruhi lost what were billed as \\"Idol Wave\\" matches against the likes of Arisa Nakajima, Ran Yu-Yu, Tomoka Nakagawa, Misaki Ohata, Kana, Yumi Ohka, Gami, and fellow Gatokunyan alum Ray, while also producing her own birthday event on October 8, which saw her lose to Tomoko Morii in the opener and to Misae Genki in the main event. Finally, on November 23, 2008, Haruhi picked up her first win in Wave, when she submitted Mio Shirai in a six-woman tag team match, where she, Kyoko Kimura and Tomoka Nakagawa faced Mio Shirai, Io Shirai and Cherry. Haruhi continued wrestling against the Shirai sisters for the early part of 2009. On March 15, Haruhi wrestled her first anniversary match in Wave, a main event singles match, where she was defeated by Azumi Hyuga. Five days later, Haruhi and Tomoka Nakagawa entered a tag team tournament to determine the inaugural TLW (Totally Lethal Wrestling) World Young Women's Tag Team Champions, defeating Haru and Kayo Fujimori in their first round match. On March 25, the two continued their tournament by defeating Ayumi Kurihara and Shuu Shibutani in the semifinals. On April 4, Haruhi won a nine-woman battle royal to capture DDT Pro-Wrestling's Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship from Bullfight Sora. She made her first successful defense of the title on April 15 against Sora, however, immediately afterwards, Sora took advantage of a rule, where the champion could be challenged for the title anytime and anywhere and pinned her to regain the title. On April 29, Haruhi and Nakagawa were defeated in the finals of the TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship tournament by the Shirai sisters. On May 27, Haruhi entered the 2009 Catch the Wave tournament, defeating Pinky Mayuka in her opening round- robin match. On June 20, Haruhi regained the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship from Cherry, only to lose it to Kaoru immediately afterwards. In her two remaining Catch the Wave matches on June 28 and July 5, Haruhi was defeated by Ayumi Kurihara and Ryo Mizunami, respectively, leading to her being eliminated from the tournament. On August 29, Haruhi defeated Shuu Shibutani during the Oi Festa/Oi Dontaku Festival to become the inaugural Asia Pacific Women's Champion. On August 10 and September 6, 2009, Haruhi was defeated in singles matches by Misaki Ohata. Afterwards, the two wrestlers formed a partnership, which eventually led to them defeating the Shirai sisters for the TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship on December 23. On January 4, 2010, Haruhi earned one of the biggest wins of her career, when she pinned Toshie Uematsu in a tag team match, where she and Aja Kong faced Uematsu and Ran Yu-Yu. On February 13 at Wave's hundredth event, Haruhi defeated Shuu Shibutani and Cherry in a four-woman single-elimination tournament to become the inaugural Garter Match Champion.

On May 30, Haruhi entered the 2010 Catch the Wave tournament, losing to Shuu Shibutani in her opening round-robin match. After a loss to Asami Kawasaki on June 20 and a time limit draw with Cherry on July 13, she finished her tournament on August 10 with a loss against Ayumi Kurihara, failing to advance from the block. During the tournament on July 4, Haruhi and Ohata lost the TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship to Bambi and Basara. During late 2010, Haruhi started a rivalry with Hiren, which built to a singles match on October 3, where Hiren was victorious. On December 19, Haruhi and Misaki Ohata defeated Hiren's stablemates Bambi and Yumi Ohka in a tag team match. However, after the match, Ohata turned on Haruhi and aligned herself with Bambi, Hiren and Ohka, becoming the leader of the villainous Black Dahlia stable. On January 4, 2011, Haruhi was pinned by Ohata in an eight-woman tag team match, where she, Ayumi Kurihara, Cherry and Ryo Mizunami faced the entire Black Dahlia stable. The rivalry between Haruhi and Hiren also led to a match in Hiren's home promotion, Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling, on January 23, where Hiren again was victorious. Haruhi continued working against Black Dahlia for the next months and, on March 20, earned a measure of revenge on Ohata by defeating her in a singles match. On April 10, Haruhi also pinned Hiren in a six-woman tag team match, where she, Ayumi Kurihara and Syuri faced Hiren, Bambi and Ohata. On August 28 at Wave's fourth anniversary event, Haruhi teamed with Black Dahlia's newest member Cherry in a tag team match, where they defeated Aya Yuki and Ryo Mizunami. For the match, Haruhi wore a black attire, but made clear that even though she liked Cherry, she still hated Black Dahlia and was not affiliated with them. On September 4, Haruhi was teamed with rival Hiren in the 2011 Dual Shock Wave tournament to determine the inaugural Wave Tag Team Champions. The team was eliminated in their first round match by Yuki and Mizunami. On October 9, Haruhi was defeated by Mayumi Ozaki in her annual birthday match. On October 27, Haruhi represented Wave in Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling's Joshi Puroresu Dantai Taikou Flash tournament, a single-elimination tournament, where different joshi promotions battled each other. In their first round match, Team Wave, which also Gami, Shuu Shibutani, Toshie Uematsu and Yumi Ohka, was defeated by Team JWP of Command Bolshoi, Hanako Nakamori, Kaori Yoneyama, Kayoko Haruyama and Leon. Haruhi started her 2012 in a six-woman tag team match on January 4, where she, Leon and Yuu Yamagata were defeated by Misaki Ohata, Cherry and Yumi Ohka, with Ohata pinning her former tag team partner for the win. On March 25, Haruhi made her debut for Oz Academy with a win over Nao Komatsu. Haruhi in April 2016 On April 8, 2012, Haruhi was defeated in a singles match by her surprise opponent, Wrestling New Classic (WNC) representative and former Gatokunyan training partner Makoto. Haruhi and Makoto had their second encounter on April 18, when Makoto and Gami defeated Haruhi and Yuu Yamagata in a tag team match. On April 30, Haruhi took part in her trainer Toshie Uematsu's retirement match, where she and Shuu Shibutani were defeated by Uematsu and Ran Yu-Yu. Afterwards, Haruhi was sidelined for five weeks with an elbow injury. On July 16, Haruhi and Yuu Yamagata unsuccessfully challenged Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa for the Wave Tag Team Championship in a three-way match, which also included the team of Mio Shirai and Shuu Shibutani. On August 7, Haruhi defeated Mio Shirai for the first successful defense of the Garter Match Championship, nearly two and a half years after she had won the title. On September 3, it was announced that Haruhi and the returning Makoto had earned themselves a wild card entry into the 2012 Dual Shock Wave tournament. Despite initially opposing the partnership with Makoto, the team, dubbed \\"1st Impact\\", opened their tournament on September 25 with a win over Ayumi Kurihara and Mika Iida, after which Haruhi embraced the new partnership. However, the team went on to lose the following matches against Hikaru Shida and Yumi Ohka, and Shuu Shibutani and Syuri, and were, as a result, eliminated from the tournament. On November 27, Haruhi reunited with Makoto in a five-way tag team match, where they defeated Aya Yuki and Sawako Shimono, Cherry and Shuu Shibutani, Hikaru Shida and Nagisa Nozaki, and Ryo Mizunami and Yuu Yamagata to become the number one contenders to the Wave Tag Team Championship. 1st Impact received their title shot on December 16, but were defeated by the defending champions, Misaki Ohata and Tsukasa Fujimoto. On December 24, Haruhi made her debut for JWP, taking part in an eleven-woman Santa Cosplay Battle Royal, which was won by Nana Kawasa.

From May 6 to June 28, Haruhi took part in the 2013 Catch the Wave tournament. Despite opening with a win over Mio Shirai and later drawing with JWP Openweight Champion Arisa Nakajima, Haruhi lost her other four matches in the tournament and finished last in her round-robin block. On September 1, Haruhi entered the 2013 Dual Shock Wave tournament, teaming with Tomoka Nakagawa. Though the team managed to pick up big wins over Kana and Yumi Ohka, and Mio Shirai and Misaki Ohata, they were eliminated per pre-tournament stipulations after suffering their third loss in their fifth match on September 29 and not allowed to finish the tournament. In early 2016, Haruhi formed a new tag team named \\"So on Flower\\" (SoF) with Aoi Kizuki. On March 13, the two won a three-way match to become the number one contenders to the Wave Tag Team Championship. They received their title shot on April 17, but were defeated by the defending champions, Las Aventureras (Ayako Hamada and Yuu Yamagata). On March 5, 2017, Haruhi received her first shot at the Wave Single Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Ryo Mizunami. Personal life Haruhi's hobbies include cosplay, which she exhibits in her in-ring attires. She also frequently writes about other interests, including anime and video games, on her blog. She is a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion and named her tag team with Makoto after the series. In November 2009, Haruhi was involved in an incident, where a male fan approached her at a fan meeting and asked if he could touch her chest. After being denied, the man, during the following months, went on to send hundreds of e-mails and text messages to Haruhi, threatening to kill her, leading to her hiring a security team to keep her safe at events. On May 9, 2011, the man, 34-year-old Naoki Kobayashi, was arrested by the Japanese police. Following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, Haruhi became interested in weather forecasting and disaster prevention and began studying with the goal of becoming a weather forecaster. On October 6, 2014, it was announced that Haruhi had become the first professional athlete to pass the weather forecaster examination, which she had taken the previous January.

After recovering from life-threatening wounds during World War II, he studied chemistry and physics at the Universities of Vienna and Graz, eventually turning to the study of the philosophy of science, and receiving his Ph.D. in 1959. He moved to the United States in 1967, in part, because of problems faced by empirically oriented philosophers in obtaining academic positions in Austria and Germany. He is notable for his contributions to philosophy of science, as a member of European Academy of Sciences and Arts, for founding the journal Theory and Decision, for co-founding Theory and Decision Library, and for co-founding the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society and International Wittgenstein Symposium. Biography Intellectual Werner Leinfellner was a pioneer of scientific philosophy, game and decision theory in the tradition of the Vienna Circle. From 1945 to 1950, he studied chemistry and physics at the University of Graz and the University of Vienna and during this time he did research in chemistry. In 1954, he turned to the study of philosophy, logic and the philosophy of science and received his Ph.D. in 1959 for his dissertation Anschauung, Abstraktion und Integration im modernen physikalischen Denken (Intuition, abstraction and integration in modern physical thought) from the University of Vienna. From 1960 to 1963, he worked as a research assistant at the University of Munich in philosophy of science and logic. In 1963, he moved back to Vienna and was a research fellow and assistant professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies in philosophy of science, economics, social and political sciences, and game and decision theory. During this time, he was also a lecturer at the University of Vienna. In 1967, due to an unfavorable political and scientific climate in post-war Austria, he was unable to obtain a tenured faculty position in Austria and so he moved to Lincoln, Nebraska and joined the department of philosophy at the university of Nebraska-Lincoln as a full professor. In 1970, he founded the journal Theory and Decision, an international journal for philosophy and methodology of the social sciences. The founding of the journal was, in part, a reaction to the dogmatic, subjective, and metaphysical approaches he had encountered in Europe prior to coming to the United States. His vision was that Theory and Decision would help found a philosophy of the social science based on three premises: :(1) it would help in the formation of categories based on logic and mathematics for the social sciences; :(2) it would promote the development of mathematical theories and research methods for the social sciences; and :(3) it would promote the integration of theories and formal methods across the social sciences. In 1974, he cofounded Theory and Decision Library also based on these three principles. Indeed, Eberlein and Berghel (1988) concluded: > It was essentially Werner Leinfellner's accomplishment that the ideal of > logical empiricism in the 1930s and 1940s, to create a \\"unified science\\", > was replaced by that of a \\"methodological unity of science\\". Accordingly,... > the THEORY AND DECISION school of the philosophy of the social science can > substantiate his claim: \\"... There are no longer any methodological > differences at issue\\". Certainly the term \\"methodological\\" has to be > interpreted in a broad sense, implicating the unity of science due to common > standards of theory formation and to the fact that theories are the > methodological basic units of the social science disciplines. Furthermore, > \\"methodological unity\\", in the context of this journal and library, refers > to the continuously differentiated and integrated unity of an undogmatic, > pluralistic philosophy of the social sciences (page xii). In 1976, Werner Leinfellner together with his wife Elisabeth Leinfellner cofounded the Austrian Wittgenstein Society and the International Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg am Wechsel. In 1986, he became professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and returned to Vienna Austria as professor at the Vienna University of Technology. In 1991, he became a member of the Science Board at the Institute Vienna Circle. Its goal is to document the continued development of the Vienna Circle's work in science and the continued application of logical-empirical thought to the philosophy of science and thereby it continues Leinfellner's goal of breaking away from irrational, dogmatic, fundamentalist though. During his career, he received several awards and prizes including Theodor K√∂rner Prize (twice), the Medal of the College de France, Paris, the Grand Honorary Cross for Science and Art, 1st Class, Austria, and membership in the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. Personal During World War II, he was required to serve in the German army and was subsequently seriously wounded on the Russian front. After a year of recovering from his wounds he deserted the German army and joined the resistance at the end of the war In 1960, he married Elisabeth Leinfellner and they had one daughter Ruth. He died in a Vienna hospital on April 6, 2010 and his wife Elisabeth preceded him in death three months earlier on January 4, 2010. Philosophical and scientific views Philosophy of science For Leinfellner, science and philosophy are complementary in that they are both required for knowledge and discovery. Science has revealed a whole new way of viewing nature and society than existed prior to the 20th century. In the past, according to Leinfellner, physical and chemical processes were thought to follow deterministic laws of nature, but this view fell through as the sciences became theoretically more rigorous. In the social and economic sciences, he argued that we have to drop the notion of deterministic laws and search for rules instead. These rules, to varying degrees, involve randomness. Indeed, there are likely an enormous number of social rules all subject to randomnes that would appear to result in chaos, but more likely these‚Äîrules discovered by the social and economic sciences‚Äîproduce systems that are more or less stable but subject to chaotic breakdowns now and then. For Leinfellner, this probabilistic aspect of rules and laws extends to the universe. Cultural evolution of social and political systems Leinfellner long viewed game and decision theory as theoretical and methodological frameworks within which the social sciences could be integrated. This was the major motivation for the founding of the journal Theory and Decision and for confounding Theory and Decision Library. Later, Leinfellner would come to view evolutionary game theory as a theoretical framework for integrating biological and cultural evolution. Once placed in an evolutionary game-theoretic framework, it is possible to explain how societal cooperation evolves even though selfishness is favored at the individual level He viewed evolution as always at work but always producing surprises. He recognized that we can partially influence evolutionary processes themselves, both biological and cultural evolution. This, however, creates an unimaginable responsibility for society especially when compared to the pre-20th-century view of humans as passive-spectators in world-as-machine view, ultimately unable to influence what we do. He viewed the evolution of society and the ability of humans to influence evolutionary processes as having enormous ethical implications, which we must deal with. The ethical implications, in part, arise because we cannot ultimately know the consequences of our influences on biological and cultural evolution. In his view, biological and cultural evolutionary processes have implications that go beyond individual humans. At a political level, authoritarian planned economies that don't consider the randomness inherent in evolutionary processes are doomed, sooner or later, to failure. The fact that we are active participants in our own biological and cultural evolution means that we can intervene with science and technology to influence our future societal evolution‚Äîwith considerable uncertainty as to the outcomes‚Äîbut this also creates fundamental philosophical and ethical problems. From a cognitive point of view, the rules by which we interact socially are the result of both biological and cultural evolution according to Leinfellner. For example, in his view, one doesn't need to necessarily learn to be a father when you see your child for the first time. There are basic \\"rules of fatherhood\\" that are instinctual. As he said: \\"At least this is how it was at the birth of my daughter\\". Nevertheless, to learn how to be a father also requires rules obtained by social and cultural learning. These rules, however, can malfunction for a variety of reasons including the fact that we have free will.

He was a merchant by trade, and his experience in transporting cargo may have helped qualify him as keeper of the Albany arsenal. He was variously referred to as storekeeper, military storekeeper and Commissary for the Northern Department. Life He was appointed as keeper of the store in 1775 and the appointment was confirmed by the Continental Congress.http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi- bin/amarch/getdoc.pl?/var/lib/philologic/databases/amarch/.5897http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi- bin/amarch/getdoc.pl?/var/lib/philologic/databases/amarch/.12454 He was also a member of the Committee of Public Safety of Albany. During the American Revolution, armourers were scarce. This is evident in George Washington's handwritten orders in a letter addressed to him. The letter also includes a list of his duties, such as arranging the repair of service muskets and transporting the overload. He was elected in May 1776 to the Albany Committee of Correspondence, second ward. Philip sat alongside his father and at least one of his brothers, Nicholas. Philip continued serving on that committee until it was dissolved. He was elected alderman for the second ward of Albany in 1782. van Rensselaer leased a tavern five miles west of the Hudson as he developed the Cherry Hill farm. His family house was on the east side of Pearl Street when he built Cherry Hill in 1768 for his wife Maria, daughter of Robert Sanders and granddaughter of Pieter Schuyler. Maria was also descended from Rev. Lawrence Sanders \\"...who suffered martyrdom at Coventry, England, 1556, during the reign of Bloody Mary\\".

This film is a recording of Tagore's 1926 stage dance-drama.  Background  The dramatized version of Tagore's Natir Puja was first staged at Rabindranath's own home Uttorayan, Konarak Rabindrabhaban, Santinikatan in 1933. At the end of 1931, Tagore came to Kolkata (then Calcutta) from Santiniketan to perform a stage production of his 1926 dance drama. Here, B. N. Sircar, an Indian film producer and the founder of New Theatres Calcutta invited Tagore to transform the play into cinema under his New Theatres banner. Tagore gave consent to film their stage production.  Filming  The film was shot on NT Studio's Floor Number 1, and it was shot within 4 days. Other than writing and directing the film, Tagore also acted in the film. The music of the film composed by Dinendranath Tagore. The cinematographer of the film was Subodh Mitra. They did not follow conventional rules, and the film was shot like a stage drama.  Release and reception  After completion of shooting and editing, the 10,577-foot-long film version was released on 22 March 1932 at Chitra, Calcutta. Because of Tagore's presence in the film, it was expected that the film would be well received by viewers. The producers of the film agreed to donate fifty per cent of the film's proceeds into Tagore's Santiniketan project. But, the film was a commercial failure. Later, the staginess of the film was blamed for this commercial failure. B. N. Sircar felt the short shooting schedule of the film was the reason of the commercial failure. However, some Bengali critics applauded the film for its \\"aesthetic values\\" (or Tagorean qualities). The Bengalee newspaper wrote in their review: > As everyone knows, apart from the charm lent to it by the Poet, the story > has an intense appeal of its own. And considering the fact that the artistes > were all amateurs in their teens, it may be said without hesitation that the > charm has not suffered and the interest of the play has been maintained > throughout.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In 2017, it was removed from the National Register. It has been described as perhaps one of the most unusual church buildings in the state, as it has a square, brick first level, about below grade, and a wood-shingled octagonal second level. The second level holds the church meeting hall, approximately in diameter. As of 1983, it was one of only two octagonal churches in Nebraska (the other being the First Congregational Church at Naponee, in Franklin County, NRHP-listed in 1982, a one-story 1887-built frame structure). It was built for cost of about $2,500, and it served as a church only from 1901 to 1911. The Ord church was formed as a Unitarian Society in 1899 by parishioners of Rev. A. H. Tyrer, who was forced to resign from the Episcopal Church for his liberal views. The church had financial difficulties, discontinued services in 1911, and disbanded in 1914. The church building was sold to the Commodore Foote Post No. 40 of the Grand Army of the Republic. It served as a club and meeting hall for that group, then from 1921 to 1961 it served in the same way for the Ord Fidelity Post No. 38 of the American Legion. As of 1983, it was in good condition, little changed from its construction. with Up to 1983, Unitarian Society churches were known to have been formed in just five Nebraska towns and cities. The only other NRHP-listed Unitarian church in the state was the First Unitarian Church of Omaha.

Reception Ratings In its third season, Homeland became the first series on Showtime to surpass seven million total viewers weekly. The season finale, \\"The Star\\", was the highest rated episode of the series to date, with 2.38 million viewers for the original broadcast. Critical response The third season received mixed reviews from critics, with many of the criticisms targeted at the second half. The first two episodes received a Metacritic score of 77 out of 100, based on 23 reviews, but reviews became more mixed as the season progressed. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the first two episodes of the season restored his faith in the series, with the emphasis on Carrie and Saul, and that \\"the writing and acting in the first two episodes are exceptional.\\" Robert Rorke of Newsday wrote that \\"the third-season premiere Homeland delivers a strong episode that repairs much of the damage done last season to this excellent show\\" and \\"In balancing action with character development, Homeland offers something for everyone. The performances, as usual, are excellent.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today praised the focus on the aftermath of the CIA bombing, and wrote \\"The result of that change of focus is a return that's quieter than the tone Homeland set when it left us but just as intense, and‚Äîwhen Danes is on screen‚Äîjust as emotionally wrenching.\\" Matthew Wolfson of Slate wrote \\"Showing us the long-term impact of the attack on the lives of these characters, whose deep-seated motivations and fears have gradually been revealed to us over the last two seasons, allows Homeland to transcend its tendencies toward the hyperbolic and gives us a reason to suspend our disbelief.\\" However, some critics had negative reviews for the season. Morven Crumlish of The Guardian found it tedious: \\"A half-absorbed piece of fiction will leave the characters floundering in their mid-arc torpor. With no end in sight, though, Carrie and Brody can flounder without me.\\" Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph agreed: \\"The ludicrous plot contortions of this season‚Äôs early episodes... had all been such a mess.\\" Awards and nominations The season was nominated for Best Drama Series for the 2014 Writers Guild of America Awards. For the 20th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the cast was nominated for Best Drama Ensemble, Claire Danes was nominated for Best Drama Actress, and the series was nominated for Best Stunt Team. For the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, Claire Danes was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and Mandy Patinkin was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.

Built in 1825-26 for a congregation founded in 1752, it is one of the state's finest examples of a Federal period church, drawing inspiration from the publications of Asher Benjamin. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Peterborough Unitarian Church stands prominently in the town center of Peterborough, at the northwest corner of Main and Summer streets. It is a single-story brick building, with a gabled roof and a multistage tower. The tower, set above the front facade, has a square first stage with round-arch louvers, an octagonal clock stage, an octagonal belfry, and a cupola crowned by a cross. The interior has a vestibule area, whose inner wall dividing it from the main space helps support the tower, and a galleried hall. Interior decorations are partly reflective of later 19th-century alterations, including the placement of pulpit and sounding board, and the trompe-l'≈ìil artwork. The church was built in 1825-26 for a congregation that was established in 1752. Its design was at one time attributed to Charles Bulfinch, but there is no documentary evidence that supports this connection, and the building clearly has Federal-style elements inspired by the publications of Asher Benjamin. The clock in its tower is owned by the town; the first was installed in 1856, the present one in 1947. The bell was installed in 1828.

Seite 262 tree of liberty on Neumarkt, Cologne, 1794 Canton de Cologne with some areas of the Canton Weiden in 1810  History   Occupation, annexation and incorporation  The occupation of areas left of the Rhine by French revolutionary troops occurred in late autumn of 1794. This annexation was preemptively recognised by the Peace of Campo Formio (1797) and later finalised in the Peace of Lun√©ville (1801). The structural area regulations from within this intermittent period were based largely on the plans and proposals for a reorganization of the conquered territories, which were developed by the Government Commissioner and Judge of the Court of Cassation, Fran√ßois Joseph Rudler. The areas to be incorporated into the Republic of France were then organised into D√©partements, much like the French provinces had been post-1789, abolishing the present forms of feudal regional administration causing a gradual assimilation of the Rhenish to the French legal system. The peace treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801 created a legal basis for the annexation of the new Rhenish d√©partements formally carried out on September 23, 1802.  Governance and reforms  Seal of the Arrondissement de Cologne Among the most significant aspects of the reorganisation was the introduction of the d√©partement's constitution in 1789. The conquered territory had been subdivided into four d√©partements whose administration consisted of five members of a specially created directorate. One of these members was elected President on a yearly basis, without the possibility for more than one consecutive term. Below this level of government were the cantons, which, along with their municipalities, formed the next level of administration. The municipal administrations were led by municipal agents, recruited from constituent settlements. Both levels of government, departmental and cantonal administrations, were monitored by government commissioners. The Napoleonic reform in February of this year, which came into force in May 1800, formed the management structure of a centralized and hierarchically-structured organisation.. Leading the d√©partements, the territories of which remained unchanged, were prefects assisted by prefectural and general councils. The latter were responsible for the judiciary and taxation-related affairs. The d√©partements were now further subdivided into arrondissements, led by subprefects, who were in turn assisted by arrondissement councils. Changes also occurred on a local level. Within the cantons, the large number of parishes, often composed of small settlements, experienced a decrease in number as ordered by the prefecture: They were united into Mairies . The respective Maire, to whom a municipal council was assigned, was subordinate to the subprefect inasmuch as the latter was subordinate to the prefect.Jakob Obermanns, Hanns Clemens, Abschnitt: Das Rheinland wird franz√∂sisches Territorialgebiet  Literature  * Joseph Hansen (Hg.): Quellen zur Geschichte des Rheinlandes im Zeitalter der Franz√∂sischen Revolution 1780-1801 * Jakob Obermanns, Hanns Clemens: Die Gemeinde L√∂venich im Spiegel der Geschichte .

(June 6, 1938 ‚Äì April 29, 2017) was an American football lineman and coach. Genyk played college football for the University of Michigan from 1957 to 1959 and was the captain of the 1959 Michigan team. He was drafted by the newly formed New York Titans (renamed the Jets in 1963) in the first tier 1960 American Football League Draft. He coached high school football in Michigan for more than 30 years. Early years Genyk was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, and graduated from Pershing High School. He played on the 1953 Pershing Doughboys football team that outscored opponents 303‚Äì55 and was selected as the state's Class A football champions. Football career Michigan career Genyk attended the University of Michigan and played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1957 to 1959. In 1957, he became the second recipient of the John F. Maulbetsch Award, presented to him as the freshman football candidate for showing \\"desire, character, capacity for leadership and future success both on and off the gridiron.\\" In May 1958, he also received a Yost Honor Award for combined athletic and scholastic achievement during the 1957‚Äì58 academic year. As a junior, he started for the 1958 Michigan Wolverines football team. The 1958 team finished in eighth place in the Big Ten Conference with a disappointing 2-6-1 record. Genyk was the starting left tackle in all nine games and appeared in 246 out of the 540 minutes of play during the 1958 season. In late November 1958, after the final game had been played, the Michigan players elected Genyk as the captain of the 1959 Michigan team. Michigan head coach Bennie Oosterbaan was fired after the 1958 season and replaced with Bump Elliott. Under the new head coach, the 1959 Wolverines improved marginally to 7th place in the Big Ten and a 4-5 record. Genyk was the starting left guard in eight of Michigan's nine games in 1959. He became known as the \\"Ironman\\" of the Michigan line, playing in 430 out of the 540 minutes in Michigan's nine football games. He missed one game after being knocked out in pregames warmups. He suffered a head wound that required several stitches. After Michigan's 1959 season was complete, Genyk accepted an invitation to play in the North‚ÄìSouth Shrine Game held at the Orange Bowl on December 26, 1959. Professional football Genyk was drafted by the New York Titans in the 1960 AFL draft. In late December 1959, Titans general manager Steve Sebo signed Genyk to a contract. It appears that Genyk was cut before the 1960 AFL season began. Later career After his playing career ended, Genyk worked as a head school football coach and high school teacher for over 30 years, including stints at Milan High School and Saginaw High School. Genyk's son, Jeff Genyk, was the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University from 2004 to 2008. Genyk died from cancer at a medical clinic in Arizona on April 29, 2017 at age 78.

Emotions are typically viewed as having three components: subjective experience, physical changes, and cognitive appraisal; emotion perception is the ability to make accurate decisions about another's subjective experience by interpreting their physical changes through sensory systems responsible for converting these observed changes into mental representations. The ability to perceive emotion is believed to be both innate and subject to environmental influence and is also a critical component in social interactions. How emotion is experienced and interpreted depends on how it is perceived. Likewise, how emotion is perceived is dependent on past experiences and interpretations. Emotion can be accurately perceived in humans. Emotions can be perceived visually, audibly, through smell and also through bodily sensations and this process is believed to be different from the perception of non-emotional material. Modes of perception Emotions can be perceived through visual, auditory, olfactory, and physiological sensory processes. Nonverbal actions can provide social partners with information about subjective and emotional states. This nonverbal information is believed to hold special importance and sensory systems and certain brain regions are suspected to specialize in decoding emotional information for rapid and efficient processing.  Visual  The visual system is the primary mode of perception for the way people receive emotional information. People use emotional cues displayed by social partners to make decisions regarding their affective state. Emotional cues can be in the form of facial expressions, which are actually a combination of many distinct muscle groups within the face, or bodily postures (alone or in relation to others), or found through the interpretation of a situation or environment known to have particular emotional properties (i.e., a funeral, a wedding, a war zone, a scary alley, etc.). While the visual system is the means by which emotional information is gathered, it is the cognitive interpretation and evaluation of this information that assigns it emotional value, garners the appropriate cognitive resources, and then initiates a physiological response. This process is by no means exclusive to visual perception and in fact may overlap considerably with other modes of perception, suggesting an emotional sensory system comprising multiple perceptual processes all of which are processed through similar channels. = Facial perception = A great deal of research conducted on emotion perception revolves around how people perceive emotion in others' facial expressions. Whether the emotion contained in someone's face is classified categorically or along dimensions of valence and arousal, the face provides reliable cues to one's subjective emotional state. As efficient as humans are in identifying and recognizing emotion in another's face, accuracy goes down considerably for most emotions, with the exception of happiness, when facial features are inverted (i.e., mouth placed above eyes and nose), suggesting that a primary means of facial perception includes the identification of spatial features that resemble a prototypical face, such that two eyes are placed above a nose which is above a mouth; any other formation of features does not immediately constitute a face and requires extra spatial manipulation to identify such features as resembling a face.  Discrete versus dimensional views  Research on the classification of perceived emotions has centered around the debate between two fundamentally distinct viewpoints. One side of the debate posits that emotions are separate and discrete entities whereas the other side suggests that emotions can be classified as values on the dimensions of valence (positive versus negative) and arousal (calm/soothing versus exciting/agitating). Psychologist Paul Ekman supported the discrete emotion perspective with his groundbreaking work comparing emotion perception and expression between literate and preliterate cultures. Ekman concluded that the ability to produce and perceive emotions is universal and innate and that emotions manifest categorically as basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, contempt, surprise, and possibly contempt). The alternative dimensional view garnered support from psychologist James Russell, who is best known for his contributions toward the circumplex of emotion. Russell described emotions as constructs which lie on the dimensions of valence and arousal and it is the combination of these values which delineate emotion. Psychologist Robert Plutchik sought to reconcile these views and proposed that certain emotions be considered \\"primary emotions\\" which are grouped either positively or negatively and can then be combined to form more complex emotions, sometimes considered \\"secondary emotions\\", such as remorse, guilt, submission, and anticipation. Plutchik created the \\"wheel of emotions\\" to outline his theory.  Culture  Culture plays a significant role in emotion perception, most notably in facial perception. Although the features of the face convey important information, the upper (eyes/brow) and lower (mouth/nose) regions of the face have distinct qualities that can provide both consistent and conflicting information. As values, etiquette, and quality of social interactions vary across cultures, facial perception is believed to be moderated accordingly. In western cultures, where overt emotion is ubiquitous, emotional information is primarily obtained from viewing the features of the mouth, which is the most expressive part of the face. However, in eastern cultures, where overt emotional expression is less common and therefore the mouth plays a lesser role in emotional expression, emotional information is more often obtained from viewing the upper region of the face, primarily the eyes. These cultural differences suggest a strong environmental and learned component in emotion expression and emotion perception.  Context  Although facial expressions convey key emotional information, context also plays an important role in both providing additional emotional information and modulating what emotion is actually perceived in a facial expression. Contexts come in three categories: stimulus-based context, in which a face is physically presented with other sensory input that has informational value; perceiver-based context, in which processes within the brain or body of a perceiver can shape emotion perception; and cultural contexts that affect either the encoding or the understanding of facial actions.  Auditory  The auditory system can provide important emotional information about the environment. Voices, screams, murmurs, and music can convey emotional information. Emotional interpretations of sounds tend to be quite consistent. Traditionally, emotion perception in the voice has been determined through research studies analyzing, via prosodic parameters such as pitch and duration, the way in which a speaker expresses an emotion, known as encoding. Alternatively, a listener who attempts to identify a particular emotion as intended by a speaker can decode emotion. More sophisticated methods include manipulating or synthesizing important prosodic parameters in speech signal (e.g., pitch, duration, loudness, voice quality) in both natural and simulated affective speech. Pitch and duration tend to contribute more to emotional recognition than loudness.Frick, R.W. (1985). Communicating emotion: the role of prosodic features. Psychological Bulletin, 97, 412¬± 429. Music has long been known to have emotional qualities and is a popular strategy in emotion regulation. When asked to rate emotions present in classical music, music professionals could identify all six basic emotions with happiness and sadness the most represented, and in decreasing order of importance, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. The emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, and peacefulness can be perceived in a short length of exposure, as little as 9‚Äì16 seconds including instrumental-only music selections.  Olfactory  Aromas and scents also influence mood, for example through aromatherapy, and humans can extract emotional information from scents just as they can from facial expressions and emotional music. Odors may be able to exert their effects through learning and conscious perception, such that responses typically associated with particular odors are learned through association with their matched emotional experiences. In-depth research has documented that emotion elicited by odors, both pleasant and unpleasant, affects the same physiological correlates of emotion seen with other sensory mechanisms.  Somatic  Theories on emotion have focused on perception, subjective experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of emotion is perceived, how emotion is perceived somatically, and at what stage of an event emotion is perceived and translated into subjective, physical experience. = James-Lange theory = Following the influence of Ren√© Descartes and his ideas regarding the split between body and mind, in 1884 William James proposed the theory that it is not that the human body acts in response to our emotional state, as common sense might suggest, but rather, we interpret our emotions on the basis of our already present bodily state. In the words of James, \\"we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.\\" James believed it was particular and distinct physical patterns that map onto specific experienced emotions. Contemporaneously, psychologist Carl Lange arrived at the same conclusion about the experience of emotions. Thus, the idea that felt emotion is the result of perceiving specific patterns of bodily responses is called the James-Lange theory of emotion. In support of the James-Lange theory of emotion, Silvan Tomkins proposed the facial feedback hypothesis in 1963; he suggested that facial expressions actually trigger the experience of emotions and not the other way around. This theory was tested in 1974 by James Laird in an experiment where Laird asked participants to hold a pencil either between their teeth (artificially producing a smile) or between their upper lip and their nose (artificially producing a frown) and then rate cartoons. Laird found that these cartoons were rated as being funnier by those participants holding a pencil in between their teeth. In addition, Paul Ekman recorded extensive physiological data while participants posed his basic emotional facial expressions and found that heart rate raised for sadness, fear, and anger yet did not change at al for happiness, surprise, or disgust, and skin temperature raised when participants posed anger but not other emotions. While contemporary psychologists still agree with the James-Lange theory of emotion, human subjective emotion is complex and physical reactions or antecedents do not fully explain the subjective emotional experience. = Cannon-Bard theory of emotion = Walter Bradford Cannon and his doctoral student Philip Bard agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences. They argued that physiological responses were too slow relative to the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion and that often these emotions are similar and imperceptible to people at such a short timescale. Cannon proposed that the mind and body operate independently in the experience of emotions such that differing brain regions (cortex versus subcortex) process information from an emotion-producing stimulus independently and simultaneously resulting in both an emotional and a physical response. This is best illustrated by imagining an encounter with a grizzly bear; you would simultaneously experience fear, begin to sweat, experience an elevated heart rate, and attempt to run. All of these things would happen at the same time. = Two-factor theory = Stanley Schachter and his doctoral student Jerome Singer formulated their theory of emotion based on evidence that without an actual emotion-producing stimulus, people are unable to attribute specific emotions to their bodily states. They believed that there must be a cognitive component to emotion perception beyond that of just physical changes and subjective feelings. Schachter and Singer suggested that when someone encounters such an emotion-producing stimulus, they would immediately recognize their bodily symptoms (sweating and elevated heart rate in the case of the grizzly bear) as the emotion fear. Their theory was devised as a result of a study in which participants were injected with either a stimulant (adrenaline) that causes elevated heart rate, sweaty palms and shaking, or a placebo. Participants were then either told what the effects of the drug were or were told nothing, and were then placed in a room with a person they did not know who, according to the research plan, would either play with a hula hoop and make paper airplanes (euphoric condition) or ask the participant intimate, personal questions (angry condition). What they found was that participants who knew what the effects of the drug were attributed their physical state to the effects of the drug; however, those who had no knowledge of the drug they received attributed their physical state to the situation with the other person in the room. These results led to the conclusion that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of a two-stage process: first, physiological arousal in a response to an evoking stimulus, and second, cognitive elaboration of the context in which the stimulus occurred. Neural bases Emotion perception is primarily a cognitive process driven by particular brain systems believed to specialize in identifying emotional information and subsequently allocating appropriate cognitive resources to prepare the body to respond. The relationship between various regions is still unclear, but a few key regions have been implicated in particular aspects of emotion perception and processing including areas suspected of being involved in the processing of faces and emotional information.  Fusiform face area  The fusiform face area, part of the fusiform gyrus is an area some believe to specialize in the identification and processing of human faces, although others suspect it is responsible for distinguishing between well known objects such as cars and animals. Neuroimaging studies have found activation in this area in response to participants viewing images of prototypical faces, but not scrambled or inverted faces, suggesting that this region is specialized for processing human faces but not other material. This area has been an area of increasing debate and while some psychologists may approach the fusiform face area in a simplistic manner, in that it specializes in the processing of human faces, more likely this area is implicated in the visual processing of many objects, particularly those familiar and prevalent in the environment. Impairments in the ability to recognize subtle differences in faces would greatly inhibit emotion perception and processing and have significant implications involving social interactions and appropriate biological responses to emotional information.  HPA axis  The hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a role in emotion perception through its mediation of the physiological stress response. This occurs through the release of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor, also known as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), from nerve terminals in the median eminence arising in the paraventricular nucleus, which stimulates adrenocorticotropin release from the anterior pituitary that in turn induces the release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. This progressive process culminating in the release of glucocorticoids to environmental stimuli is believed to be initiated by the amygdala, which evaluates the emotional significance of observed phenomena. Released glucocorticoids provide negative feedback on the system and also the hippocampus, which in turn regulates the shutting off of this biological stress response. It is through this response that information is encoded as emotional and bodily response is initiated, making the HPA axis an important component in emotion perception.  Amygdala  The amygdala appears to have a specific role in attention to emotional stimuli. The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped region within the anterior part of the temporal lobe. Several studies of non-human primates and of patients with amygdala lesions, in addition to studies employing functional neuroimaging techniques, have demonstrated the importance of the amygdala in face and eye-gaze identification. Other studies have emphasized the importance of the amygdala for the identification of emotional expressions displayed by others, in particular threat-related emotions such as fear, but also sadness and happiness. In addition, the amygdala is involved in the response to non- facial displays of emotion, including unpleasant auditory, olfactory and gustatory stimuli, and in memory for emotional information. The amygdala receives information from both the thalamus and the cortex; information from the thalamus is rough in detail and the amygdala receives this very quickly, while information from the cortex is much more detailed but is received more slowly. In addition, the amygdala's role in attention modulation toward emotion-specific stimuli may occur via projections from the central nucleus of the amygdala to cholinergic neurons, which lower cortical neuronal activation thresholds and potentiate cortical information processing. Disordered emotion perception There is great individual difference in emotion perception and certain groups of people display abnormal processes. Some disorders are in part classified by maladaptive and abnormal emotion perception while others, such as mood disorders, exhibit mood-congruent emotional processing. Whether abnormal processing leads to the exacerbation of certain disorders or is the result of these disorders is yet unclear, however, difficulties or deficits in emotion perception are common among various disorders. Research investigating face and emotion perception in autistic individuals is inconclusive. Past research has found atypical, piecemeal face- processing strategies among autistic individuals and a better memory for lower versus upper regions of the face and increased abilities to identify partly obscured faces. Autistic individuals tend to display deficits in social motivation and experience that may decrease overall experience with faces and this in turn may lead to abnormal cortical specialization for faces and decreased processing efficiency. However, these results have not been adequately replicated and meta-analyses have found little to no differential face processing between typically-developing and autistic individuals although autistic people reliably display worse face memory and eye perception which could mediate face and possibly emotion perception. Individuals with schizophrenia also have difficulties with all types of facial emotion expression perception, incorporating contextual information in making affective decisions, and indeed, facial perception more generally. Neuropathological and structural neuroimaging studies of these patients have demonstrated abnormal neuronal cell integrity and volume reductions in the amygdala, insula, thalamus and hippocampus Wright, I. C., Rabe-Hesketh, S., Woodruff, P.W. R., et al (2000) Regional brain structure in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of volumetric MRI studies. American Journal of Psychiatry, 157, 16^25. and studies employing functional neuro-imaging techniques have demonstrated a failure to activate limbic regions in response to emotive stimuli, all of which may contribute to impaired psychosocial functioning. In patients with major depressive disorder, studies have demonstrated either generalized or specific impairments in the identification of emotional facial expressions, or a bias towards the identification of expressions as sad. Neuro-pathological and structural neuroimaging studies in patients with major depressive disorder have indicated abnormalities within the subgenual anterior cingulate gyrus and volume reductions within the hippocampus, ventral striatal regions and amygdala. Similarly, anxiety has been commonly associated with individuals being able to perceive threat when in fact none is present, and orient more quickly to threatening cues than other cues. Anxiety has been associated with an enhanced orienting toward threat,Williams, J. M. G., Watts, F. N., MacLeod, C., & Matthews, A. (1988). Cognitive psychology and emotional disorders. Chichester, England:Wiley. a late-stage attention maintenance toward threat, or possibly vigilance-avoidance, or early-stage enhanced orienting and later-stage avoidance. As a form of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has also been linked with abnormal attention toward threatening information, in particular, threatening stimuli which relates to the personally relevant trauma, making such a bias in that context appropriate, but out of context, maladaptive. Such processing of emotion can alter an individuals' ability to accurately assess others' emotions as well. Mothers with violence-related PTSD have been noted to show decreased medial prefrontal cortical activation in response to seeing their own and unfamiliar toddlers in helpless or distressed states of mind that is also associated with maternal PTSD symptom severity, self-reported parenting stress, and difficulty in identifying emotions and which, in turn, impacts sensitive caregiving. Moreover, child maltreatment and child abuse have been associated with emotion processing biases as well, most notably toward the experience-specific emotion of anger.Cicchetti, D., Toth, S. L., & Maughan, A. (2000). An ecological- transactional model of child maltreatment. In A. J. Sameroff, M. Lewis, & S. M. Miller (Eds.), Handbook of developmental psychopathology (2nd ed., pp. 689-722). New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum. Research has found that abused children exhibit attention biases toward angry faces such that they tend to interpret even ambiguous faces as angry versus other emotions and have a difficulty disengaging from such expressions Pollak, S. D. (2003). Experience- dependent affective learning and risk for psychopathology in children. In J. A. King, C. F. Ferris, & I. I. Lederhendler (Eds.), Roots of mental illness in children (pp. 102-111). New York: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. while other research has found abused children to demonstrate an attentional avoidance of angry faces. It is believed to be adaptive to attend to angry emotion as this may be a precursor to danger and harm and quick identification of even mild anger cues can facilitate the ability for a child to escape the situation, however, such biases are considered maladaptive when anger is over- identified in inappropriate contexts and this may result in the development of psychopathology. Research methods Researchers employ several methods designed to examine biases toward emotional stimuli to determine the salience of particular emotional stimuli, population differences in emotion perception, and also attentional biases toward or away from emotional stimuli. Tasks commonly utilized include the modified Stroop task, the dot probe task, visual search tasks, and spatial cuing tasks. The Stroop task, or modified Stroop task, displays different types of words (e.g., threatening and neutral) in varying colors. The participant is then asked to identify the color of the word while ignoring the actual semantic content. Increased response time to indicate the color of threat words relative to neutral words suggests an attentional bias toward such threat. (Reprinted in 1992 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 121, 15‚Äì23). The Stroop task, however, has some interpretational difficulties in addition to the lack of allowance for the measurement of spatial attention allocation. To address some of the limitations of the Stroop task, the dot probe task displays two words or pictures on a computer screen (either one at the top or left and the other on the bottom or right, respectively) and after a brief stimuli presentation, often less than 1000ms, a probe appears in the location of one of the two stimuli and participants are asked to press a button indicating the location of the probe. Different response times between target (e.g., threat) and neutral stimuli infer attentional biases to the target information with shorter response times for when the probe is in the place of the target stimuli indicating an attention bias for that type of information. In another task that examines spatial attentional allocation, the visual search task asks participants to detect a target stimulus embedded in a matrix of distractors (e.g., an angry face among several neutral or other emotional faces or vice versa). Faster detection times to find emotional stimuli among neutral stimuli or slower detection times to find neutral stimuli among emotional distractors infer an attentional bias for such stimuli. The spatial cuing task asks participants to focus on a point located between two rectangles at which point a cue is presented, either in the form of one of the rectangles lighting up or some emotional stimuli appearing within one of the rectangles and this cue either directs attention toward or away from the actual location of the target stimuli. Participants then press a button indicating the location of the target stimuli with faster response times indicating an attention bias toward such stimuli. In the morph task participants gradually scroll a facial photograph from the neutral expression to an emotion or from one emotion to another and should indicate at what frame each emotion appears on the face.

Getting proper funding and allocating it correctly have always been a challenge for public schools. With this funding schools can keep textbooks up to date and have adequate computer resources.

It is named after Tom W. B. Kibble, who pioneered the study of domain structure formation in the early universe, and Wojciech H. Zurek, who related the number of defects it creates to the critical exponents of the transition and to its rate‚Äîto how quickly the critical point is traversed. Basic idea Based on the formalism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, Tom Kibble developed the idea for the primordial fluctuations of a two-component scalar field like the Higgs field. If a two-component scalar field switches from the isotropic and homogeneous high-temperature phase to the symmetry-broken stage during cooling and expansion of the very early universe (shortly after Big Bang), the order parameter cannot be necessarily the same in regions which are not connected by causality. Regions are not connected by causality if they are separated far enough (at the given age of the universe) that they cannot \\"communicate\\" even with the speed of light. This implies that the symmetry cannot be broken globally. The order parameter will take different values in causally disconnected regions and the domains will be separated by domain walls after further evolution of the universe. Depending on the symmetry of the system and the symmetry of the order parameter, different types of topological defects like monopoles, vortices or textures can arise. It was debated for quite a while if magnetic monopoles might be residuals of defects in the symmetry- broken Higgs field. Up to now, defects like this have not been observed within the event horizon of the visible universe. This is one of the main reasons (beside the isotropy of the cosmic background radiation and the flatness of spacetime) why nowadays an inflationary expansion of the universe is postulated. During the exponentially fast expansion within the first 10‚àí30 second after Big-Bang, all possible defects were diluted so strongly that they lie beyond the event horizon. Today, the two-component primordial scalar field is usually named inflaton. Relevance in condensed matter The blue curve shows the divergence of correlation times as function of the control parameter (e.g. temperature difference to the transition). The red curve indicates the time to reach the transition as function of the control parameter for linear cooling rates. The intersection point marks the temperature/time when the system falls out of equilibrium and gets non-adiabatic. Wojciech Zurek pointed out, that the same ideas play a role for the phase transition of normal fluid helium to superfluid helium. The analogy between the Higgs field and superfluid helium is given by the two-component order parameter; superfluid helium is described via a macroscopic quantum mechanical wave function with global phase. In helium, two components of the order parameter are magnitude and phase (or real and imaginary part) of the complex wave function. Defects in superfluid helium are given by vortex lines, where the coherent macroscopic wave function disappears within the core. Those lines are high-symmetry residuals within the symmetry broken phase. It is characteristic for a continuous phase transition that the energy difference between ordered and disordered phase disappears at the transition point. This implies that fluctuations between both phases will become arbitrarily large. Not only the spatial correlation lengths diverge for those critical phenomena, but fluctuations between both phases also become arbitrarily slow in time, described by the divergence of the relaxation time. If a system is cooled at any non-zero rate (e.g. linearly) through a continuous phase transition, the time to reach the transition will eventually become shorter than the correlation time of the critical fluctuations. At this time, the fluctuations are too slow to follow the cooling rate; the system has fallen out of equilibrium and ceases to be adiabatic. A \\"fingerprint\\" of critical fluctuations is taken at this fall-out time and the longest-length scale of the domain size is frozen out. The further evolution of the system is now determined by this length scale. For very fast cooling rates, the system will fall out of equilibrium very early and far away from the transition. The domain size will be small. For very slow rates, the system will fall out of equilibrium in the vicinity of the transition when the length scale of critical fluctuations will be large, thus the domain size will be large, too.In condensed matter, the maximal signal velocity is not given by the speed of light but by the sound velocity (or second sound in case of superfluid helium). The inverse of this length scale can be used as an estimate of the density of topological defects, and it obeys a power law in the quench rate. This prediction is universal, and the power exponent is given in terms of the critical exponents of the transition. Derivation of the defect density Exponential divergence of correlation times of a Kosterlitz‚ÄìThouless transition. Left inset shows the domain structure of a 2D colloidal mono-layer for large cooling rates at the fall-out time. The right inset shows the structure for small cooling rates (after additional coarsening) a late times. Domain size as function of cooling rate in a colloidal mono-layer. The control parameter is given by the interaction strength \\\\Gamma in this system. Consider a system that undergoes a continuous phase transition at the critical value \\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_c = 0 of a control parameter. The theory of critical phenomena states that, as the control parameter is tuned closer and closer to its critical value, the correlation length \\\\xi and the relaxation time \\\\tau of the system tend to diverge algebraically with the critical exponent u as \\\\xi \\\\sim \\\\lambda^{- u}, \\\\qquad \\\\tau \\\\sim \\\\lambda^{-z u}, respectively. z is the dynamic exponent which relates spatial with temporal critical fluctuations. The Kibble‚ÄìZurek mechanism describes the nonadiabatic dynamics resulting from driving a high-symmetry phase \\\\lambda\\\\ll0 to a broken-symmetry phase at \\\\lambda\\\\gg0. If the control parameter varies linearly in time, \\\\lambda(t) = vt, equating the time to the critical point to the relaxation time, we obtain the freeze out time \\\\bar{t}, \\\\bar{t} = [\\\\lambda(\\\\bar{t})]^{-z u} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\bar{t} \\\\sim v^{-z u / (1+z u)}. This time scale is often referred to as the freeze-out time. It is the intersection point of the blue and the red curve in the figure. The distance to the transition is on one hand side the time to reach the transition as function of cooling rate (red curve) and for linear cooling rates at the same time the difference of the control parameter to the critical point (blue curve). As the system approaches the critical point, it freezes as a result of the critical slowing down and falls out of equilibrium. Adiabaticity is lost around -\\\\bar{t}. Adiabaticity is restored in the broken-symmetry phase after +\\\\bar{t}. The correlation length at this time provides a length scale for coherent domains, \\\\bar{\\\\xi} \\\\equiv \\\\xi[\\\\lambda(\\\\bar{t})] \\\\sim v^{- u/(1+z u)}. The size of the domains in the broken-symmetry phase is set by \\\\bar{\\\\xi}. The density of defects immediately follows if d is the dimension of the system, using \\\\rho \\\\sim \\\\bar{\\\\xi}^{-d}. Experimental tests The Kibble‚ÄìZurek mechanism generally applies to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios where a global symmetry is broken. For gauge symmetries defect formation can arise through the Kibble‚ÄìZurek mechanism and the flux trapping mechanism proposed by Hindmarsh and Rajantie. In 2005, it was shown that KZM describes as well the dynamics through a quantum phase transition. The mechanism also applies in the presence of inhomogeneities, ubiquitous in condensed matter experiments, to both classical, quantum phase transitions and even in optics. A variety of experiments have been reported that can be described by the Kibble‚ÄìZurek mechanism. A review by T. Kibble discusses the significance and limitations of various experiments (until 2007). Example in two dimensions A system, where structure formation can be visualized directly is given by a colloidal mono-layer which forms a hexagonal crystal in two dimensions. The phase transition is described by the so called Kosterlitz‚ÄìThouless‚ÄìHalperin‚ÄìNelson‚ÄìYoung theory where translational and orientational symmetry are broken by two Kosterlitz‚ÄìThouless transitions. The corresponding topological defects are dislocations and disclinations in two dimensions. The latter are nothing else but the monopoles of the high-symmetry phase within the six-fold director field of crystal axes. A special feature of Kosterlitz‚ÄìThouless transitions is the exponential divergence of correlation times and length (instead of algebraic ones). This serves a transcendental equation which can be solved numerically. The figure shows a comparison of the Kibble‚ÄìZurek scaling with algebraic and exponential divergences. The data illustrate, that the Kibble‚ÄìZurek mechanism also works for transitions of the Kosterlitz‚ÄìThoules universality class.

During the Ming and Qing dynasties matchlock muskets were used in China, and the Chinese used the term \\"bird-gun\\" () to refer to muskets. Mao Zedong remarked \\"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\\" in 1927 and 1938, a sentiment that was continued after winning the civil war. The country's strict centralized stance on gun control was officially instated in the country in 1966, and extended in 1996 when the government banned the buying, selling and transporting of firearms without official permission.Hu Yinan, Writing on the wall for guns, Chinadaily.com, 18 August 2010 (18 August 2019) According to the Chinese police, up until 2006, an underground gun-trading triangle in Southwest China fed the Chinese gun market, with guns being manufactured in Songtao and trafficked into Xiushan and Huayuan before reaching a national distribution scale. From June to September 2006 (6-month crackdown), the Chinese authorities confiscated 178,000 illegal guns, 3,900 tons of explosives, 7.77 million detonators and 4.75 million bullets.Zhu Zhe, China reiterates stance on gun control, Chinadaily.com, 21 April 2007 (accessed on 18 August 2019) In 2007, a study released by the Geneva-based Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies estimated that around 40 million guns were owned by Chinese civilians, an over-estimation according to the Chinese authorities. Throughout the 2000s, The Wall Street Journal noted a rise of gun popularity in China. Specifications In China, firearms can be used by law enforcement, the military and paramilitary, or security personnel protecting property of state importance (including the arms industry, financial institutions, storage of resources, and scientific research institutions). Civilian ownership of firearms is largely restricted to non-individual entities such as sporting organizations, hunting reserves, and wildlife protection, management and research organizations. The chief exception to the general ban for individual gun ownership is for the purpose of hunting. Individuals who hold hunting permits can apply to purchase and hold firearms for the purpose of hunting. Illegal possession or sale of firearms may result in a minimum punishment of 3 years in prison, and the penalty for a gun crime is death penalty. Airsoft guns are also practically prohibited due to the Ministry of Public Security dictating very restrictive new criteria that rendered most such toy guns being defined as real firearms, and violation may lead to a criminal conviction for illegal possession of firearms. Special regions Miao people The possession of traditional smoothbore blackpowder muskets is allowed to some Miao hill people, the so-called Miao gun tribes, as an essential element of traditional dress and culture; however, possession of gunpowder is regulated. Biasha people The Biasha people living in Bingmei, Guizhou, claim they can legally possess guns, since they use them for their annual traditional performance. Hong Kong and Macau Firearm ownership in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau is tightly controlled and possession is mainly in the hands of law enforcement, military, or private security firms (providing protection for jewelers and banks). Still, possessing, manufacturing, importing, or exporting airsoft guns with a muzzle energy not above is legal to citizens in China's SARs. Firearms control was inherited during British and Portuguese rule and more or less retained today. Under the Section 13 of Cap 238 Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance of the Hong Kong law, unrestricted firearms and ammunition requires a license.
