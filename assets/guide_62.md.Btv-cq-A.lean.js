For the English edition, the translator Galvin rearranged some of the text to produce a more readable work. One scholar criticized this, saying \\"This is a disservice to the text, since part of its overall significance as an 'enlightened' compendium resides precisely in its structure as a miscellany.\\"Katzew, Ilona, Casta Painting.

He drew native plants and flowers (cacao, vanilla, avocado, sapote, mamey, passion flower, and pricky pear cactus) as well as animals not known in Europe. What has gained most attention are his depictions of race mixture (castas), which have been published in works on that topic. O'Crouley provides written text for the illustrations, which were likely copies of existing casta groupings. He devotes an entire section of text to the condition of the Indians, lamenting their current state. Unlike many casta paintings that show scenes of imagined everyday life of the racial types, O'Crouley's lack any further context.Garc√≠a S√°iz, Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n, Las castas mexicanas: Un g√©nero pict√≥rico americano.

He travelled north to presidios of Los Ad√°es, in Texas; El Paso del Norte; and the province of Nayarit. His description of New Mexico is considerably longer than the places coming before it. Also lengthy is the chapter on his voyage up the Gulf of California; his description of California itself; and an expedition to Nueva Andaluc√≠a (Sinaloa and Sonora).

History The earliest evidence of human activity in the region date back to 1500 or 1600 BC, as showed by the pilotis excavated in 1893. However, the history of the village of Glerula dates back to the Roman era. At this time, the area was a stage on the route that connected Italy to Gaul through the Great St Bernard Pass.

In the 5th century, the building was transformed into a Christian mausoleum which was entirely re-built after the tidal wave that caused Mount Tauredunum to collapse in 563: around 590, Bishop of Lausanne Marius of Avenches established a new church over the remains of the former building.

It is native to Asia where it feeds on grasses and other plants and is a major pest of sugarcane. Description The adult P. perpusilla has an elongated snout with piercing and sucking mouthparts, and a soft body, and is a yellowish-brown colour. Males have a wing-span of about and females are slightly smaller, averaging . The eggs are ovoid, white to yellowish-green and about long. The nymphs are creamy-white and each instar stage has long filaments projecting near the anus. Distribution P. perpusilla is native to southern Asia and occurs in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Hosts Besides sugarcane, this planthopper has been found feeding on other host plants, and breeding on some of them. These include maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, bitter melon, okra, Vietnamese luffa, watermelon, squash, rice, wild oat, pea and Indian thorny bamboo. Life cycle Adult female P. perpusilla lay small batches of eggs on sugarcane leaves, mostly on the underside but sometimes on the upper surface, and during the winter, inside the leaf sheath. The eggs are laid in four or five rows and are protected with filaments of whitish wax protruded by the female. They hatch after six to thirty days depending on the time of year. The nymphs pass through five developmental stages, before moulting for a last time and becoming adult. Breeding commences eight or more days later. In Sri Lanka, fecundity in the female is about 133; females live longer than males but there is no overlap of generations because the longevity of the adults is less than the time taken for the nymphs to develop. In India, fecundity ranges up to 880, and the lifespan ranges from 14 to 200 days depending on climatological conditions. Ecology The planthopper feeds on its host by inserting its stylet into a leaf and sucking out the phloem sap. Excess fluid is excreted as honeydew and sooty mould grows on it. The plant's vigour is reduced through the loss of sap and the reduction in photosynthesis resulting from the sooty mould. Brown patches appear on the leaves, which may also become discoloured. The leaves may wilt, later becoming desiccated and brown. In India, P. perpusilla has at least 16 species of natural invertebrate enemies; some of these are parasitoids attacking the eggs and young nymphs, while others are predators and parasitoids of older nymphs and adults. The most successful parasitoid seems to be the moth Epiricania melanoleuca, and it is being used in biological pest control of P. perpusilla.

She was a co-founder of the R√©seau Marcel (\\"Marcel Network\\") which saved more than 500 Jewish children from death during The Holocaust. Although she was arrested and tortured by the Gestapo, she refused to divulge the locations of the hidden Jewish children and was sent to two concentration camps. After Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was liberated in 1945, Abadi continued her profession as a doctor, with a focus on tuberculosis. On 29 July 1999, Abadi died by suicide and the Les Enfants et Amis Abadi organisation was created the following year by one of the children she saved. In 2008, a square in Paris was named \\"Place Moussa et Odette Abadi\\" as a tribute to the couple's work. On 28 October 2017, the \\"Square Odette et Moussa Abadi\\" was inaugurated in Nice in recognition of their work. Early life and education Odette Rosenstock was born in Paris on 24 August 1914, to garment factory owners Camille and Marthe Rosenstock. She also grew up with a younger sister. Although born Jewish, her family did not practice the Jewish religion. Secretly, Rosenstock appreciated some of the principles and her Jewish background but hid her desires due to the Nazi movement in Germany. Concerned about injustice and the growth of Nazism, she began attending meetings and debates as a teenager. She graduated from high school in 1933 and began studying medicine. Career =Physician and inspector= After qualifying as a doctor during the Spanish Civil War, Rosenstock went to the Pyrenees in 1938 to welcome and rescue Spanish Republican refugees from the war. She returned to Paris to finish her medical studies and earned a diploma in hygiene-prevention. The next year, she met Moussa Abadi, a fellow doctor, in December 1939 through a mutual friend. After the Nazi invasion of France, her father fled to the south. However her mother and younger sister Simone were captured by the Nazis before they could join him, and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where they both died. Rosenstock was appointed Medical Inspector of Social Security at the Evacuation Centers for Children of the Schools of the City of Paris, then Medical Inspector of Loiret Schools in Montargis. She stayed in these roles until October 1940, when anti-Jewish laws forced her out of a job. Unable to return to her former position, Rosenstock was hired as a temporary worker in Jewish dispensaries before they eventually closed and then as a midwife. =R√©seau Marcel= During this time, Rosenstock remained in communication with Abadi who encouraged her to join him in Nice, where he had fled. In order to reach Nice, she swam across the river to get from Occupied France into the Free Zone. At the end of November 1942, she met up with refugee Moussa Abadi in Nice, and together they collected children left abandoned after their Jewish parents were arrested. She also worked for the ≈íuvre de secours aux enfants with her future husband. Eventually, using the resources provided by the Bishop of Nice, they co-founded the R√©seau Marcel (\\"Marcel Network\\") which saved 527 Jewish children between 1943 and 1945 by hiding them within Catholic institutions. Both Rosenstock and Abadi obtained false papers identifying them as Christian as Vichy police began rounding up Jewish people. Under the false name of Sylvie Delattre, Rosenstock acted as a social worker for the Church and approached Protestant families, while Abadi sought convents and Catholic schools to hide the Jewish children. Through word of mouth, Jewish parents learnt about the R√©seau Marcel and preemptively left their children with the couple before leaving for the camps or attempting to flee. Using the Churches resources, Rosenstock and Abadi falsified baptism certificates and gave Jewish children a new identity. Concentration camps On 25 April 1944, Rosenstock was arrested interrogated and tortured by the Gestapo before being deported to concentration camps. During the interrogation, she refused to divulge any information despite the promise of release in return. After realizing the reality of her arrest, Abadi fell into deep distress and was encouraged to seek refuge in the hinterland. However, he refused to abandon the children and often slept alone in the Church. Rosenstock was firstly sent to Auschwitz- Birkenau before being moved to Bergen-Belsen, where she contracted typhus. While in Auschwitz-Birkenau, she was appointed a doctor under the guidance of Josef Mengele, although she lacked many medical necessities. In documents released after the war, she revealed a previously unknown protocol for combatting contagious diseases, which was that when infected individuals were discovered, their entire block was sent to the crematoria. After Allied troops liberated the captives at Bergen-Belsen in April 1945, Moussa Abadi received a note in Nice that read ‚ÄúOdette is alive.‚Äù Post-war career and life Upon their reconnection in Nice, Rosenstock married Moussa Abadi in 1959, becoming Odette Abadi. They were marriage legally at the town hall of the 12th arrondissement, and later through a religious ceremony performed by Rabbi Farhi. They spoke little about the R√©seau Marcel and their work during the war. During and after the war, Abadi continued her profession as a doctor, with a focus on tuberculosis, and her husband became a theater critic. From 1978 until 1994, she worked as a doctor at a private college for those with hearing difficulties called Cours Morvan. In the 1980s, she was awarded the Legion of Honor and Silver Medal of the National Academy of Medicine. She also wrote a book about her time in concentration camps during WWII called Terre de d√©tresse which was published in 1995. Moussa Abadi died in 1997 and two years after her husband's death, Abadi died by suicide on 29 July 1999. She left behind a suicide note addressed to the children that she had helped to save. Legacy Les Enfants et Amis Abadi organisation was created on 4 May 2000 by one of the children saved by the Abadis, Jeannette Wolgust. Its purpose is to bring together the children hidden by the couple and preserve their memory. On 13 September 2008, a square in Paris was named \\"Place Moussa et Odette Abadi\\" as a tribute to the couple's work. On 28 October 2017, the \\"Square Odette et Moussa Abadi\\" was inaugurated in Nice in recognition of their work.

There are two subspecies. Taxonomy According to Addison Emery Verrill it may have first been collected in 1881-1883 by the International Polar Expedition to Point Barrow, Alaska, where some starfish of the genus Asterias were collected at a depth of 7 fathoms on a pebbly seabed just off of Port Clarence. The species was first described by Verrill as Allasterias rathbuni in 1909 as the type species for his new genus Allasterias. He commemorated Richard Rathbun, curator of marine invertebrates at the United States National Museum, in the specific epithet. He described three varieties: the nominate, var. anomala and var. nortonensis (named after the Norton Sound in Alaska). The variety anomala was described by Verrill in this 1909 work from St. Michael Island in the southeast of Norton Sound. In 1914 Verrill raised var. anomala to an independent species, Allasterias anomala. In 1923 Walter Kenrick Fisher synonymised Allasterias with Asterias, and in 1930 synonymised anomala, rathbuni and rathbuni var. nortonensis with Asterias amurensis. In 1950 Alexander Michailovitsch Djakonov reinstated the taxon as A. rathbuni, and subsumed A. anomala under A. rathbuni as forma anomala, accepting all other of Verrill's forms. Fisher synonymised the variety nortonensis with A. amurensis in 1930; the World Register of Marine Species maintains this classification despite following Djakonov's recognition of the variety as a form of A. rathbuni, and Jangoux and Lawrence also largely following Djakonov. =Intraspecific variation= Verrill originally recognised three varieties in 1909: the nominate, var. anomala and var. nortonensis. Fisher considered all three to be synonyms of Asterias amurensis sensu stricto. Regarding var. nortonensis, he stated that it is only known from five specimens recovered from Norton Bay in Alaska, these varied in spination, with the type being the most divergent among them (the only specimen Verrill was able examine), but all within the diversity to Russian specimens of A. amurensis, and thus maintaining recognition for this taxon was unwarranted. In 1950 Djakonov described one new subspecies, crassispinis, and recognised four formae of the nominate subspecies: the nominate, alveolata, anomala and nortonensis. Jangoux and Lawrence followed Djakonov in 2001, but recognised f. anomala as a synonym of the nominate, and classed alveolata and nortonensis as varieties of A. rathbuni ssp. rathbuni. Two subspecies are accepted in the World Register of Marine Species by Christopher Mah as of 2008: *A. rathbuni ssp. rathbuni (Verrill, 1909) *A. rathbuni ssp. crassispinis Djakonov, 1950 \\\\- Found in the Sea of Okhotsk and around Sakhalin. The arm length is up to 14.6cm. Description This starfish has five arms, broad at the base but tapering to acute tips, four times as long as broad. The central disc of specimens preserved by drying is rather broad. The dorsal skeleton is reticulated and rather weak, thus specimens preserved in alcohol are soft and flaccid. There are numerous small pedicellariae on both the dorsal and lateral surfaces. There are also many small papulae and small and numerous spines on the dorsal surface. The dorsal surface is entirely covered by an areolate or reticulate pattern; the areolations are 1.5-2mm across. The arm length is up to 17cm; on average, the ratio between the length of the arm and the radius of its disc is 4.3:1. It has planktonic larvae. =Similar species= Verrill found it a quite distinct Asterias species within its range due to the finely and regularly areolated dorsal surface, the reticulated and flaccid skeleton, and small spines. He found it most resembling Asterias rollestoni, which differs from it by virtue of less dense spines near the mouth, but longer and larger spines dorsally and marginally, and larger and more numerous pedicellariae. Compared with A. versicolor it has much more numerous, though smaller dorsal and lateral spines, these being differently arranged. Compared with A. amurensis, it has more and shorter dorsal spines. Djakonov found it to be the most similar to A. amurensis, and Fisher went further by considering it identical to A. amurensis. Distribution and habitat In Russia it is known from the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea, and in the United States around the Aleutian Islands and in Alaska in the Bering Sea. It has been found at depths of 9-170m. Djakonov complies the distribution of Asterias rathbuni f. anomala, now considered a synonym of the nominate type, as off the Kamchatka peninsula and around the Commander Islands, east to the Shumagin Islands off Alaska, north to the Chukchi Sea, usually at depths of 20m, but in America specimens have been recovered down to 170m. The anomala form was originally recovered off St. Michael Island in the southeast of Norton Sound, Alaska. A. rathbuni f. alveolata was first recovered in 1910 at a depth of 53m from a gravelly sea bottom in the Karaginsky Gulf in the Bering Sea off the northeastern Kamchatka peninsula. A. rathbuni f. nortonensis was found in the Norton Sound off Alaska, and has not been found elsewhere. A. rathbuni ssp. crassispinus is known from the Sea of Okhotsk and around Sakhalin.

From the mid-nineteenth until the mid-twentieth century, they featured prominently in the colonial bureaucracy of Java as Chinese officers, and played an important role in the sugar industry. Like many in the Cabang Atas, they were pioneering, early adopters of European education and modernity in colonial Indonesia. During the Indonesian Revolution, they also hosted most of the negotiations leading to the Linggadjati Agreement of 1946. Origin and rise The family is descended from Kwee Giok San, a Chinese migrant who left his native Fujian in the 1820s for Nanyang ‚Äì the 'South Sea' ‚Äì before finally settling down around the 1840s in Ciledug, a small town in the Residency of Cirebon on the border of West Java and Central Java. By the mid-nineteenth century, Kwee had associated himself with the Cabang Atas through his wife, Oei Tjoen Nio, a probable sister-in-law of Tan Kim Lim, Kapitein der Chinezen (grandfather of Tan Tjin Kie, Majoor-titulair der Chinezen), whose family had served as Chinese officers since the start of the nineteenth century in Cirebon and Batavia, capital of the Indies. By the 1860s, Kwee had acquired his own sugar factory. Kwee's descendants through his two sons, Kwee Ban Hok and Kwee Boen Pien, continued the family's ascent. The youngest, Boen Pien, bought the important Djatipiring sugar factory, from its previous European owners in August 1873. In October 1874, Boen Pien was installed as Luitenant der Chinezen of the districts of Sindanglaut, Losari and Ciledug ‚Äì the family's first Chinese officer. In 1884, Luitenant Kwee Boen Pien died in office and was succeeded in both his Chinese lieutenancy and Djatipiring by his second son, Kwee Keng Liem. That same year, Kwee Keng Eng, also part of the family's third generation through his father Kwee Ban Hok, was appointed Luitenant der Chinezen of Cirebon, serving under the city's Kapitein. The latter was, like his cousin, also the owner of an important sugar factory, that of Kalitandjoeng. In the fourth generation, Luitenant Kwee Keng Liem's eldest son Kwee Zwan Hong succeeded his father in 1908 as Luitenant of Sindanglaut, Losari and Ciledug, and was further elevated to the higher rank of Kapitein- titulair in 1924. Kapitein-titulair Kwee Zwan Hong was in office until 1934, when the institution of Chinese officers was abolished in Java, and was the last sitting Chinese officer in Cirebon. The Kapitein's half-brother, Kwee Zwan Lwan, won a seat on the Regency Council of Cirebon in 1925, and by the 1930s had succeeded his eldest brother as a de facto head and Chinese community leader of Cirebon. Like their ancestor Kwee Giok San, successive generations of his descendants contracted strategic marriages with other families of the Cabang Atas. The third generation typified this web of alliances: Luitenant Kwee Keng Eng was married to Tan Oen Tok Nio, Majoor- titulair Tan Tjin Kie's sister, while the former's cousin, Luitenant Kwee Keng Liem was married to the Majoor's cousin, Tjoa Swie Lan Nio. On his first wife's death, Luitenant Kwee Keng Liem then married the much younger and western-educated Tan Hok Nio, grandniece of Luitenant Tan Kong Hoa of Batavia and Luitenant Tan Yoe Hoa of Bekasi. In addition to Kapitein-titulair Kwee Zwan Hong from his first marriage, Luitenant Kwee Keng Liem had one daughter and three sons from his second marriage: Kwee Der Tjie, Kwee Zwan Lwan, Kwee Zwan Liang and Kwee Zwan Ho. In the fourth generation, Kapitein-titulair Kwee Zwan Hong married Lim Ke Tie Nio, daughter of Lim Goan Tjeng, Luitenant der Chinezen of Batavia, while his half-sister, Der Tjie, married Han Tiauw Bing, son of Kapitein Han Hoo Tjoan of the Pasuruan branch of the powerful Han family of Lasem. Their brothers, Zwan Lwan, Zwan Liang and Zwan Ho were married respectively to Jenny Be Kiam Nio, daughter of the bureaucrat and courtier Be Kwat Koen, Majoor-titulair der Chinezen of Surakarta; to Roos Liem Hwat Nio, heiress of a Surabaya family and grandniece of Luitenant Liem Bong Lien of Pasuruan; and to Betty Tan Ing Nio, granddaughter Tan Goan Piauw, Kapitein der Chinezen of Buitenzorg and Landheer (or landlord) of the vast Tegalwaroe domains. Pioneers of modernity and an international outlook Family members of the fourth and fifth generations who matured in the 1910s were 'agents of change' and 'carriers of modernity' in the words of the Dutch historian Peter Post, in particular the daughter and three sons of Luitenant Kwee Keng Liem's second marriage. The Luitenant and his wife employed European tutors and governesses to give their children a modern western education, and later sent some of them to board with European families in Batavia in order to attend the colonial capital's superior western-style educational institutions. Kwee women, like the men of the family, enjoyed a lot of freedom and embraced western-style modernity. Another example of their modern outlook to their peers was the family's enthusiastic adoption of car ownership. The first car in the Dutch East Indies belonged to the colony's premier native monarch, Pakubuwono X, Susuhunan of Surakarta, who bought a Mercedes Benz in 1894, thereby becoming the world's first car-owning monarch. A cousin of the Kwee family, Tan Gin Han, son of Majoor Tan Tjin Kie, bought a luxurious six-metre Fiat in 1914. Later that year, inspired by their cousin, the Kwee brothers bought a Lancia Theta Coloniale. By 1916, the family had four automobiles; and by the 1920s they had acquired two luxury cars: a Pierce-Arrow (also owned by the likes of Emperor Hirohito of Japan and Shah Reza Pahlavi of Iran) and a Marmon. In 1929, the Kwee family of Ciledug played host to King Rama VII of Siam at Djatipiring thanks to the intercession of their well-connected in-law, Majoor-titulair Be Kwat Koen of Surakarta, whose family had earlier hosted the monarch's father, King Chulalongkorn, in 1896. This visit gave the family much prestige, highlighting as it did their modern outlook and international connections. Beyond sugar, revolution and exile Due to the sugar crisis during the Great Depression, the Kwee brothers of the fourth generation sold Djatipiring in 1931. Kwee Zwan Liang moved to Bandung, capital of West Java, while his other brothers, Kapitein-titulair Kwee Zwan Hong, Kwee Zwan Lwan and Kwee Zwan Ho moved to Linggadjati, a fashionable hill station outside Cirebon, where they built their villas. The Kwee family compound and garden in Linggadjati became a well-known attraction of West Java all through the 1930s; and the family often hosted visiting dignitaries. During the Indonesian Revolution (1945‚Äî1949), the Kwee family befriended their neighbor in Linggadjati, Sutan Sjahrir, the first Prime Minister of Indonesia, and offered their compound as a venue for Dutch-Indonesian peace negotiations. Linggadjati had the benefit of being located halfway between the headquarters of the two warring factions: Batavia, where the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration had reestablished itself on the one hand; and Yogyakarta, where the revolutionary government was based on the other hand. It was, thus, at the family compound that the historically momentous Linggadjati Agreement of 15 November 1946 was negotiated. With the increasing radicalization of newly independent Indonesia under Sukarno's revolutionary government in the 1950s, members of the Kwee family of Ciledug began leaving Indonesia for the Netherlands, where most of them reside today.

Biography Vincenzo Cappello was born in Venice in 1469, to Nicol√≤ Cappello. He is first noticed at Milan in October 1499, when he unsuccessfully tried to sell a \\"necklace of the King of the Romans (\\"collar fo dil re di romani\\") to King Louis XII of France. On 30 August 1502, and again on 28 March 1504, he was appointed to the post of state treasurer (camerlengo de Com√πn). =Captain of the Flanders convoy= In June 1504, he was given charge of the great trade galley convoy (muda) to Flanders and London, one of the most lucrative commercial routes of the time. After months of preparations, the convoy sailed in February 1505. The journey proved successful, so that by July 1506, the Venetian ships were so laden with merchandise for the return journey that 300 balls of wool had to be left behind. On 27 July 1506 Cappello was received by King Henry VII of England, who awarded him trading privileges, knighted him, and gave him the right to include the Tudor rose in his own arms. As representative of the Republic of Venice, Cappello also received the King's messages of goodwill and alliance to the Republic. On the return journey, Cappello's good fortune was again apparent: attacked by Genoese warship that thought he was a pirate, and brought to Cagliari, he not only managed to have his identity confirmed there, but also gathered new merchandise to the value of 6,000 ducats. On his return to Venice on 28 November 1506, his ships, laden with goods, made a great impression and secured him considerable wealth, which Cappello employed in pursuing a political career. =Political and military career= In April 1509, Cappello disclosed that he had loaned 10,000 ducats to the Republic. Although this was denied, it helped his popularity, and his election to the Venetian Senate was quick. While enjoying considerable popularity, he nevertheless also had detractors who accused him of intending to dominate the state. First fleet commands Boosted by his popularity, he was elected to the senior office of superintendent of the Venetian navy (Provveditore all'Armata) on 14 January 1512. In this position, he displayed great skills and knowledge of naval matters, as well as political maturity. The navy was in poor shape at the time, lacking organization, men, and even hardtack for the ships. Although he tried to remedy the situation, this shortage led to some bitter experiences: in July 1514, at Corfu, lack of hardtack forced him to cease pursuit of a fleet of twenty Ottoman fustas, while in December 1515 he was forced to disband his fleet at Istria, as the officers and crews demanded their delayed pay. As a result, in his customary report (relazione) to the Venetian government, he severely criticized the navy's organization. In the meantime, he briefly participated in the defence of Padua in February 1514 (during the War of the League of Cambrai), before going to suppress, with considerable harshness, the Hvar rebellion. Governor of Famagusta Gate of the medieval \\"Othello Castle\\" of Famagusta In December 1515 he was appointed as fortress commander (capitano) at Famagusta on Cyprus, after a gift of 2,000 ducats to the Republic. Cappello found the fortifications of Famagusta utterly insufficient to face an Ottoman attack, and denounced the behaviour of the Venetian officials on the island as \\"scandalous\\". Being firmly convinced of the \\"bad faith\\" of the Ottomans, he devoted himself to strengthening the defences of the city, which he achieved with only a modest additional monthly spending of 400 ducats. His successor, Bartolomeo Contarini, who replaced him in March 1519, expressly praised his work. Rise to high political offices Leaving Famagusta on 10 March 1519, on 29 July he was back in Venice, resuming his career in the Republic's government. He refused a nomination as superintendent of fleet provisions and equipment (Provveditore all'Armar) on 16 August, but instead became a member of the Council of Ten on 16 October. On 19 June 1520, he became ducal councillor (consigliere ducale) for the sestiere of Santa Croce, and lieutenant-governor (luogotenente) of Friuli on 9 September 1520. From this position he carefully observed Ottoman military moves in Dalmatia. He returned to Venice on 7 June 1522. He was elected as an orator to the new Pope, Adrian VI, in August, he did not go to Rome because of the outbreak of the plague there, and himself contracted an illness that forced him to stay at Ferrara. He became consigliere of the sestiere of Cannaregio on 26 May 1523, and refused an appointment as Duke of Candia on 27 September. In October, he participated in an inquest into the activities of the Ten and \\"against the sects and the suborners of the public offices\\". Again elected orator to the newly elected Pope Clement VII on 26 November, he declined due to renewed poor health. On 3 May 1524 he was member of the board of the Savi a Tansar, followed by election as superintendent on sales (Provveditore sopra le Vendite) on 9 December. On 1 February 1525, he was elected one of the three consiglieri da basso who represented the Doge at the criminal appeals court, the Council of Forty (Quarantia Criminale), and on 30 September 1526 one of the forty elected to the zonta. On 1 September 1527 he again became a member of the Ten, and on 3 October 1527 one of the reviewers of the accounts of the Ten (revedadori di le Casse). Renewed fleet commands, Preveza, and death On 5 March 1529, he was appointed one of the seven Savi di Terraferma, on 1 August, as consigliere \\"beyond the Canal\\", and finally, on 12 September, again as Provveditore all'Armata. Conscious of the fleet's problems, Cappello made specific demands to accept the position, requiring the government to furnish sufficient men, hardtack, and funds. His quarrels with the Senate delayed his departure and left a legacy of tense relations, which survived despite his re-appointment to the post on 11 June 1532. Monument to Vincenzo Cappello at his burial church of Santa Maria Formosa Tasked with \\"restoring order to the fleet\\", but without provoking either the Turks or the Holy Roman Emperor, Cappello found his assignment fraught with worries. Reappointed to his post in 1534, in his reports to the Senate, he elaborated on the lack of hardtack, the desertion of his men to the Emperor's better-paying forces, the inadequacy of the fortifications in the Republic's overseas possessions (especially Zara, Sebenico, and Corfu), and the inefficiency of the naval construction system. As the historian Achille Olivieri points out, however, Cappello was no reformer: his outlook remained grounded in practical, everyday reality eschewing great risks and ideals in favour of a Venetian state secure in its strength, immobile, and almost \\"removed from the disruptive dialectic of the historical process\\". In 1535, he was elected ducal councillor for the sestiere of Castello. Following the outbreak of the Third Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian Wari in 1537, he was elected as Provveditore all'Armata. The fleet of Venice and its allies (chief among them Habsburg Spain) captured the fortress of Castelnuovo, leaving behind a Spanish garrison, but was defeated by the Ottoman navy at the Battle of Preveza in September 1538. Blamed by the Spanish for the defeat and taken ill, he returned to Venice, where he became a member of the Savi Grandi. In January 1539 he participated in the election of Pietro Lando as Doge, and was elected as Procurator of St. Mark de supra. He died on 19 August 1541, and was buried at the church of Santa Maria Formosa, whose fa√ßade is decorated with his statue.

It dates to the artist's early mature years and may be identifiable with the work recorded in the parish church in the town by Francesco Paglia in 1675 as \\"a painting in which one can admire the Most Holy Virgin with the Christ-Child, St Peter and other saints, a singular work by Moretto\\".Pier Virgilio Begni Redona, pag. 218Francesco Paglia, pagg. 16‚Äì17 However, the subjects clearly refer to it being commissioned by the Dominicans, which seems to suggest that the work has always been in the church of San Domenico and that the work is not that mentioned by Paglia, with a temporary transfer to the parish church seemingly unlikely. The altarpiece also does not include Saint Peter ‚Äì Paglia may have been confused the work with a painting in the parish church in Orzivecchi which does include St Peter, though this too seems unlikely. That work in Orzivecchi was for a time attributed to Moretto, but is now securely attributed instead to Giovanni Battista Moroni. In Paglia's favour, art historians have always been uncertain in which saints are shown in the painting at San Domenico: in 1898 Pietro da Ponte identified \\"Saint Dominic\\" and \\"Saint Joseph\\" to the Madonna's left but identified those to her right as \\"Saint Bonaventure\\" and \\"Saint Catherine [of Alexandria]\\".Pietro Da Ponte, pag. 58 Until 1936 it was referred to by Bernard Berenson generic title of \\"Madonna with Four Saints and a Donor\\",Bernard Berenson 1907 p. 265, 1927 p. 265 whilst later descriptions gave varied descriptions until Pier Virgilio Begni Redona finally resolved the issue in 1988 using the saints' attributes ‚Äì Dominic has a star above his forehead and holds a lily and a book, Joseph holds a stick and a flowering staff, Vincent Ferrer carries a lily, has a dove on his shoulder and a flame above his head and Lucy holds an awl and two eyes.Pier Virgilio Begni Redona, p. 220 References Bibliography *Bernard Berenson, The North Italian Painters of the Renaissance, New York-London, 1907 *Bernard Berenson, The Italian Painters of the Renaissance, New York-London, 1927 * Pietro Da Ponte, L'opera del Moretto, Brescia 1898 * Stefano Fenaroli, Alessandro Bonvicino soprannominato il Moretto pittore bresciano.

Earlier, when John took Ariminum, he had bypassed Auximus and Urbinus which would have to be taken now to secure the road to Ravenna. The Gothic king, Witigis, had sent a man called Moras with 2.000 troops to defend the city. In the year 538, the Byzantine commander, Belisarius went to besiege the town while another strong Byzantine contingents besieged Urviventus. The forces of Narses and John, other Byzantine commanders, who were undermining Belisarius' authority, joined him in this venture. Thinking the defenders would be terrified on seeing the Byzantine army, Belisarius sent envoys offering the garrison a chance to surrender. Narses and John set up camp separately form Belisarius, on the other side of the town, and, after negotiations with the garrison failed, totally abandoned the siege. They declared taking the town impossible and moved to capture Aemilia but while Belisarius was preparing to assault the town surrendered due to the failure of its spring. astonished by such success, Narses sent John to capture Caesena but this assault failed. John then moved to and managed to capture Forocornelius. After this siege Belisarius moved to support in the siege of Urviventus, also capturing that city shortly after.

The reported casualties included at least 10,000 victims. The Armenian sources report that the earthquake caused the collapse of buildings, several landslides, and changes to the area's water supply network. The earliest surviving primary source on the earthquake is the chronicle of Movses Kaghankatvatsi (10th century). He reports that the earthquake was accompanied by \\"an impenetrable darkness\\" over the borders of Mozu. According to his narrative the earth kept shaking for 40 days, and nearly 10,000 people were \\"swallowed up\\". According to Movses, the earthquake caused the area to be named \\"Vayots Dzor\\", which he translates as the \\"valley of woe\\". A more detailed account is given by the historian Stephen Orbelian (13th century). He viewed the earthquake as a divine punishment. He reports a thick darkness covering the region for 40 days, but a single, powerful and destructive earthquake. The upheaval of the earth reportedly caused widespread damage, from the depth of the abysses to the great heights of the region. He compares the heaving of the earth to the sea waves. He reports the collapse of mountains, the complete crumbling of rocks. Common houses and fine palaces alike were turned to tombs for their residents. Springs and rivers dried up. Sounds similar to human voices were heard from the depths, reportedly speaking of the valley of woe. He estimates that the known 10,000 victims were registered taxpayers. He reported that nobody knew how many unregistered people perished in the earthquake. Kirakos Gandzaketsi (13th century) gives an abbreviated account of Orbelian's narrative. An Armenian synaxarium dating to c.767-769 briefly mentions the earthquake. Soviet sources report that traces of the event were confirmed by geomorphological analyses and examination of the region by aerial photography. The valley of Vayots Dzor includes a number of monastic settlements, none of which predates the 9th century. There has been no archaeological excavation of the region. It is assumed that the earthquake destroyed local religious centers, which were later rebuilt. There is no specific mention of destroyed villages. The placename \\"Mozu\\" is not attested in other sources. While the Armenian sources attribute the name Vayots Dzor to this earthquake, the toponym already appears in a 7th-century geographic text. It is unclear whether this early reference is a later-day gloss in the text or was part of the original work.

Second Iraqi civil war  When the second Iraqi Civil war erupted, Major Salam Hussein led the 2nd battalion of the 1st division (ISOF-1), part of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces, known as the Golden Division. Major Hussein is critical of Iraq's political establishment, especially former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, whom he regards as the main cause of his country's crisis. He forbade the use of influential Shia cleric Hussein's flag, frequently seen flying over Iraqi army's vehicles and voiced his opposition to anti-Sunni sectarian policies and violence supported or encouraged by various Shia politicians in power. He joined the battles of Tikrit and Ramadi. On June 9, 2016, while involved in the battle of Fallujah where he sustained injuries from a missile attack. In late 2016, while taking part in the second battle of Mossul, he led the Golden Division which breached Mosul's Eastern defenses on November 1, 2016. In late December 2016, after the conquest of the Eastern side of Mosul, he left for the US in order to train 6 months. He returned to Mosul in June 2017 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, to lead the offensive on Mosul's old town, on the western bank of the river.

It was based upon a play of the same name by Kieran Hurley, who adapted the screenplay with Welsh; Steven Soderbergh acts as an executive producer. The plot follows a pair of teenage friends in 1994 Scotland who try and sneak into an illegal rave party. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 17 May 2019.  Premise  The film is set in 1994 in Scotland, against the backdrop of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which effectively banned outdoor rave parties across the whole of the UK. Best friends Johnno and Spanner are going to a rave for the first, and perhaps last time together.  Production  Brian Welsh first came into touch with Steven Soderbergh around 2015, when Soderberg has seen an episode of Black Mirror that Welsh had directed and approached him with a new project. While Welsh turned that down, he showed Soderberg his Beats script, who then joined as an executive producer on the film. For the climatic rave sequence, filming took place in a warehouse in the Glasgow city centre, using over 1,500 background actors.  Release  Beats had its international debut at the 2019 International Film Festival Rotterdam. On 17 May 2019 it was released in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and on 7 November 2019 in the Netherlands. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 52 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.64/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Well-acted and enlivened by an evocative soundtrack and period detail, Beats draws timeless themes out of its specific story and setting.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Wendy Ide of The Guardian gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: \\"It's a terrific little film that combines the earthy humour and honesty of a Shane Meadows movie with an unexpected expressionistic section ‚Äì flooded with colour ‚Äì that channels the boys' joyful dancefloor abandon.\\" In a separate Guardian review, Mike McCahill gave it three stars, saying that \\"this teen bromance eventually escapes into amiable nostalgia and artful euphoria\\".

Ct. 1945 (2018). The Supreme Court, in reversing a lower appellate panel, explained that the public criticism Lozman expressed at a city council meeting, where he had been arrested, was protected speech. The existence of a cause to arrest him for his outburst did not override the city's potential liability in retaliating against him for his public criticism. The Court sent the case back to the lower court to reconsider its dismissal of Lozman's claim. Background Fane Lozman sued the city of Riviera Beach, Florida over a planned use of eminent domain, arguing the city had violated open-meeting laws in approving a private development plan. Afterwards, he alleged the city council held a closed-door session where several city council members proposed an effort to \\"intimidate\\" Lozman and others who had filed lawsuits against the city.\\" Lozman later appeared at a meeting of the city council, criticizing their work with a separate manner, when he was instructed to stop speaking. After refusing, Lozman was arrested. Afterwards, Lozman filed suit against the city, alleging retaliation against his speech. Opinion of the Court The majority opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy held that the existence of probable cause to arrest Lozman, which had been the reason lower courts dismissed his suit, did not immunize the city from the retaliatory claim. Kennedy stressed that the decision was narrow, based on the circumstances of Lozman's specific case.

Under her direction, the Friends‚Äô Mission hospital in Constantinople developed into a ‚Äòmultifunction campus‚Äô,Michelle Tusan, The Business of Relief Work: A Victorian Quaker in Constantinople and Her Circle, in: Victorian Studies, Vol. 51, No. 4 (Summer 2009), pp. 633-661 where educational work was underpinned by funds raised from abroad through the sale of craft goods, produced on a quasi-industrial scale. Early life Ann Mary Burgess was born in Upwell, Norfolk, in 1861, the second of four daughters of William Burgess and Mahala n√©e Seaton. After a girlhood spent mostly in Yorkshire, by 1881 she had returned to East Anglia and was a maidUK Census, 1881 in the household of Alexander Peckover, a wealthy Quaker banker in Wisbech, Cambs. Here she first felt the call to help the poor overseas. Mission work in Constantinople Although originally seeking to work with women in the zenanas of India, Burgess, by now secretary to the active philanthropist Priscilla Peckover, was persuaded to consider a position with the Friends‚Äô Mission Hospital in Constantinople, where the clientele came primarily from the Armenian minority community. After a brief period of training as a nurse in Banbury, Oxfordshire, Burgess left for Turkey in 1888, and was soon busy. In the wake of the earthquake of 1894, more beds were added to cater for an increasing number of widows and orphans, but the hospital had to close in 1896 when its doctor, himself an Armenian, fled to England in fear of his life.Annett, Edward. ‚ÄúFifty Years among the Armenians: A Brief record of the Work of Ann Mary Burgess.‚Äù Rushden, Northants [1938] Despite the closure of the hospital, demand for the relief of suffering remained strong, and funding was needed. Burgess set about developing a network of contacts with well-disposed groups including in the Quaker and Temperance movements, giving her the business foundations for what she termed ‚Äòindustrial‚Äô work for the women and orphans in her charge, who were given meaningful employment which in turn raised the funds needed to keep the mission running. The women initially turned their hands to needlework, knitting and oriental embroideries. Later, rug-making was introduced. The mission‚Äôs premises were considerably expanded, and the workshop products were sold to Britain, the USA, and Germany, as well as finding a market in Constantinople itself. In the early 1900s, there were over 400 women workers, and annual turnover was reaching ¬£8-10,000. Toys were added to the range, and from 1904, confectionery. Activity was severely constrained during the 1914-18 war (the school buildings were requisitioned for use as barracks), but Burgess found ways of continuing to ship goods to the UK.Tusan, Annett, op cit Emigration to Greece By 1922, intercommunal relations in Turkey had deteriorated disastrously. In September, Turkish troops under Kemal Atat√ºrk captured Smyrna, and the mission‚Äôs situation in Constantinople was judged unsustainable. Having taken advice, in November of that year Burgess oversaw the hasty evacuation of the mission school and factory operations to the Greek island of Corfu, where a temporary base was established in an old British fortress. This was a difficult period, and in 1924, Burgess herself had to come back to Britain to give talks and organise sales, often at Friends‚Äô Meeting Houses, to help replenish funds.Birmingham Gazette, 12 Nov 1924, Banbury Advertiser, 4 Dec 1924 She made a similar visit in the winter of 1926.Gloucester Journal, 30 Oct 1926 The Corfu site was never wholly satisfactory, and in 1931 a further relocation took place, to Nea Kokkinia, a town near Piraeus largely populated by Greek and Armenian refugees from Turkey. A refugee employment initiative of 1924 to start a carpet workshop there had failed, but the empty premises were available and Burgess took them on. Despite an episode of neuritis not long after this move, which necessitated 18 months of recuperation in Britain, Burgess continued the successful management of the mission‚Äôs various activities. In late 1938, she came home, her half-century of philanthropic service among the Armenians being marked by the Friends with a commemorative book,Annett and a birthday party in her honour in London. Later years Towards the end of her life, Burgess was able to realise her early ambition to work in India, taking a position at an American mission hospital, the Ellen T Cowen Memorial Hospital in Kolar, South India. She died there on 31 December 1943, aged 82.UK Probate Index  References   External links  * Other materials relating to her life are held at the Library of the Society of Friends in London Category:1861 births Category:1943 deaths Category:English women philanthropists Category:Quaker Philanthropy Category:19th-century Quakers Category:20th-century Quakers Category:English expatriates in Greece Category:British emigrants to Greece Category:People from King's Lynn and West Norfolk (district) ","title":"Ann Mary Burgess"},{"id":"62316561","text":"The Watkins 25, also known as the W25 and marketed as the Seawolf 25 from 1986, is an American sailboat that was first built in 1983. Development The Watkins 25 design is believed to have been based upon the hull moulds for the Columbia 24, with a newly designed deck and coachhouse roof. The design was later sold to Com-Pac Yachts and was developed into the Com-Pac 25. Production The design was built by Watkins Yachts in Clearwater, Florida, United States. About 183 examples of the design were produced from 1983 to 1989, but it is now out of production. Design The Watkins 25 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a vertical transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the deep keel and with the optional shoal draft keel. The deep draft keel was developed at the request of a customer by cutting off the old keel mould and making a new one for a cast lead keel. Only a few were produced, probably between two and five. Each boat was custom-built to the buyer's specifications, so the fleet varies in options and features. A bow-mounted anchor platform was optional. When mounted, a different pulpit was used and the forestay was shortened to accommodate the wooden platform, but retained the same attachment point and sail plan. Other options include a flushing head, pressurized water, a hot water tank and a reboarding ladder. The design's hull is molded in a single piece using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving, as well as multidirectional chopped strand fibers (MSCF). The keel is integral to the hull and the ballast is internal to the keel. The deck and the cockpit and also moulded in pone piece, also using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving with MCSF. Plywood coring is employed for the cabin top, deck, seat and the cockpit sole for stiffness. The hull-to-deck joint is flanged, glued and then screwed into place. There is an aluminum toe rail, stainless steel through-bolted into place, bonding the toe rail, deck and the hull. The spars are all coated 6061-T6 aluminum extrusions. There is a single reefing point. The mainsheet design involved two blocks, one on each side or the cabin top, although many have been modified to a mainsheet traveler. An anchor well is located at the bow with a hawspipe leading the anchor chain into the \\"V\\" berth locker. The main cabin has of headroom and is finished with hand-rubbed teak trim, with the bulkheads and cabinetry made from teak veneer on plywood. The main cabin sole is teak and holly veneer over plywood. The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor of for docking and maneuvering, although a Yanmar inboard diesel engine of was a factory option. The fresh water tank has a capacity of . Ventilation on early boats was provided by two opening plastic framed ports with integral screens and on later boats built three aluminum framed ports, also with integral screens. All boats also have an extruded aluminum framed Bomar forward deck hatch.

Stampede The stampede began before a free concert by Venezuelan music act in the Parque del Este (officially Gen. Francisco de Miranda Park) in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. The concert was called Banderas Blancas. Over 8,000 people, largely teenagers, showed up to attend the concert; fighting and pushing broke out after a group of young people climbed over a park fence to get into the concert. It is reported that though the concert was to begin at 10 am, many of the people were breaking into the park early and causing chaos. Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s reports that the concert was \\"marked by negligence and improvisation\\" and that there were limited police officers from the National Guard in attendance outside the park, being supplemented by park rangers. The number of concertgoers overwhelmed the security, who could not control the flow of people. The main crush of people took place between the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var bridge and La Carlota, at around 8:50 am. People climbing the fences eventually toppled them, which then caused mass stampede into the park, according to the local crime commissioner. Victims The first deceased victim was found dead at the scene and transferred to the Domingo Luciani Hospital, while another two were transferred through the P√©rez de Le√≥n Hospital; one was operated on here before dying, with the two being transferred to the Domingo Luciani and then the Bello Monte morgue. Another person was killed; all of them were aged 14. Most of the victims were treated at the P√©rez de Le√≥n Hospital, with others treated at the Centro Diagn√≥stico Integral de Los Dos Caminos and the Domingo Luciani Hospital. These hospitals have trauma centers, as many of the injured had suffered asphyxiation and polytrauma in the stampede. Aftermath Neutro Shorty speaks to concertgoers after the stampede The concert, which was planned to happen at the Concha ac√∫stica stage in the park, was moved. Neutro Shorty posted on social media that it would still take place at the planned time, but in nearby Parque Sim√≥n Bol√≠var ‚Äì concertgoers crossed into this park and rioted in the performance area. Neutro Shorty performed three songs, but the concert was stopped at this point and the parks cleared as emergency services continued to treat injured people in the area. The National Parks Institute of Venezuela, the body that ultimately administers the parks, later used social media to announce that though the body is sad at the events, the concert was taking place without their permission. The concert organizers have not commented, and no group has taken responsibility. Neutro Shorty also gave a message in response, before he went on stage, saying \\"I came to sing to them for free, I didn't come to screw them over, or anything political, or anything. [...] What is happening is sad, children are passing out, I feel bad when I see their faces. I don't want this to keep happening.\\" A Venezuelan NGO founder spoke out about how the tragedy at the park is a microcosm of the country, and that society needs to assess itself when children are using violence as their first option to get what they want. = Investigation = Tarek William Saab announced that a full investigation will happen, and will be conducted by the division for child protection. The investigation, involving the forensics branch, began on Sunday 10 November. By 12 November, three people had been arrested in relation to the stampede, including two concert organizers. There were rumors that one of those arrested was Neutro Shorty; Saab confirmed that this was untrue on 13 November.

It emerged in Italy around 1770 as Tarocc 'Ombre but later spread to Austria and Germany. It was a crucial development, with the important idea of bidding imported from l'Hombre, hence the name.  History  Taroc l'Hombre appears to be an Austrian development of Tarocc 'Ombre, a card game originating in Lombardy, Italy, which, however, was played with a 54-card shortened, Italian-suited pack. Tarocc 'Ombre was \\"a development of the highest importance in the history of Tarot\\" because it introduced the concept of bidding. In Italy this idea fell out of favour, but not before it had crossed the Alps to other countries where \\"the true future of Tarot games lay in those that incorporated bidding\\". Among the earliest games of this type in Austria and Germany was a small family of games generally known as Taroc l'Hombre (later also Tarok l'Hombre). Dummett believes they were introduced to Germany no later than around 1770, but the earliest rules do not appear until 1795. By that stage, two variants had already been distinguished: a newer and an older type. In addition, the age of the game is indicated by the fact that the lowest bid, √† Tr√©, was no longer played out, but forehand, if not overcalled, was just paid the minimum amount. These two variants continued to be played throughout the 19th century, but the game then faded into obscurity, the last description of its rules being published in 1905. Meanwhile 2 other variants had been recorded. The first was a form with declarations which, Dummett admits, may well be the result of a compiler wrongly combining two different games. Second, is a four-player variant that appears even earlier than the first account of Taroc l'Hombre and which Dummett calls Tarok-Quadrille, but which the earliest source simply records as a new version of \\"Taroc between 4 people... played as in Quadrille\\".  Rules  The following rules, based on \\"Legistes\\" (1795) except where stated, remained current. They are described as the older type \\"which is also more difficult\\". = Cards = The game is played with a 78-card, French- suited, Tarock pack. The Tarocs rank from XXI (highest) to I (lowest). There are two different hierarchies in the plain suits. The red suits rank from Ace (high) to Ten (low); the black suits from Ten (high) to Ace (low). The Sc√ºs, which depicts a Pickelhering (comedy character) is one of the Tarocs, but acts as an 'excuse' as will be explained. The I is known by its usual name, the Pagat and the Ace is also called the Ponto. The card values are as follows: * XXI, I and Sc√ºs - 5 points each * King (K√∂nig) - 5 points * Queen (Dame) - 4 points * Cavalier or Knight (Caval or Reuter) - 3 points * Valet or Jack (Valet or Bube) - 2 points * Empty cards (leere Bl√§tter) - 1 point for every 3 cards. = Deal = Deal and play are clockwise. The game is designed for three players. If four play, each player in rotation is the 'King' and sits out for that deal. The dealer gives 25 cards to each opponent and 28 to himself, of which he discards 3 cards as the scat, which count to him at the end. These discards must not include the XXI, Pagat or Sc√ºs, any King or any Taroc. = Auction = There are four positive bids which, in ascending order are: √† Tr√©, √† Due, √† Uno and Solo. However √† Tr√©, also called √† Trio, is not played out; instead, if the others pass, forehand (left of the dealer) is gratuitously paid the game value. In a Due, the declarer commits to scoring over 39 points with the help of 2 counting cards which he calls for from his opponents in return for 2 cards of his choice. In a Uno he may call for just one card from his opponents and in Solo, he goes it alone without the help of any additional cards. The game is won with 40 of the available 78 points; 39 is a tie (remis) and below that, the declarer has lost. Forehand has the right to bid first and may announce a Trio even without looking at his cards. But because this contract is not played and it is likely to be overcalled, he may examine and arrange his hand. If the next player bids a Due, forehand may \\"hold\\" (ich behalte es) or \\"pass\\". The second player must now pass or overcall with a Uno. If forehand holds, he needs to raise it to Solo. If they reach Solo, the bidding is over and the third player (the dealer) does not get to bid; otherwise the dealer bids against the player who did not pass. Again, the earlier player has the right to hold a bid. As Dummett points out, it is likely that the declarer could raise his bid having won the auction, although the rules are not explicit on this point. = Play = Play is clockwise and forehand leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible; otherwise must play a Taroc if possible. Lacking any cards of the led suit or any Tarocs, a player may discard. The trick winner leads to the next trick. The feat of winning every trick is called a Tout and earns significant additional points. = Role of the Sc√ºs = The Sc√ºs is may be played at any time to avoid following suit, which is typically used to avoid losing a counter. For example, if a player has an unguarded Queen and the King of the same suit is played, he can play the Sc√ºs to save his Queen. The Sc√ºs is then recovered to his tricks and he gives the trick winner an 'empty card' (pip card or ordinary Taroc) from his tricks (this may be done later if he has no empty cards at the time). He may only do this once during the deal. = Scoring = The usual Tarock scoring system is used, whereby cards won in tricks are grouped in threes. For each trio, the card points are added up as per their values above and 2 deducted from the total. The game values were reckoned in marques (\\"chips\\") as shown below. These were paid √† personne i.e. to the successful declarer by each defender or by the unsuccessful declarer to each defender: * A Tre - 10 marques * A Due - 20 marques + 1 marque per point over 39 * A Uno - 30 marques + 2 marques per point over 39 * Solo - 60 marques + 6 marques per point over 39 * Tout - 200 marques (√† Due), 300 marques (√† Uno) and 600 marques (Solo)  Variants  = \\"Newer Type\\" = The so-called \\"newer type\\" of Taroc l'Hombre appeared at the same time as the \\"older type\\" portrayed above and both continued to be published until the popularity of the game evidently waned. \\"Legistes\\" describes it as easier than the older type. Differences in play were as follows: after having the pack cut but before dealing, the dealer set the top three cards to one side as the scat and dealt, again, 25 cards each. This time there were only 3 contracts - a Due, a Uno and Solo - but only the last two were actually played. If anyone successfully bids a Due, the cards were thrown in and the bidder receives the game value. This apparently happened often. The main difference, however, was that the declarer, not the dealer, had the use of the scat. This was a \\"crucial innovation\\" which paved the way in subsequent games of the Tarock group for expanding the range and scope of bids according to the number of cards taken from the scat. = Tarok-l'Hombre with declarations = This is only described in the 1829 edition of Neuestes allgemeines Spielbuch and incorporates many of the declarations found in Grosstarock, a form of classical tarot. These included \\"Three Matadors\\" (the combination of Mangur or XXI, Pagat and Sc√ºs - worth 10 points) \\"Ten Taroks\\" (10 points), Cavallerie (all four court cards of one suit - 4 points). There were various other rule changes. For example, there were differences in the cards that could be discarded to the scat, the √† Tr√© contract was dropped and the Sc√ºs had to be played before the last three tricks. However, while Dummett does not rule out the possibility that it could have been \\"the last Tarok game to be played [in Austria] with 78 cards\\", he also suggests that it may just have been an editor's compilation of rules from different games and may never have existed in practice. = Tarok-Quadrille = The earliest account of Taroc being played \\"like Quadrille\\" appears over a decade before the first rules of Taroc-l'Hombre in the 1783 edition of Das neue k√∂nigliche Hombre where it says that \\"recently it has been found that Taroc is played between 4 people in the manner of Quadrille\\". Dummett calls this \\"Tarok-Quadrille\\" and believes that, although it had probably died out by 1850, it contained \\"a number of unusual and interesting features.\\" The four players form temporary alliances and play with 76 cards of a 78-card pack, the Aces of Clubs and Spades being removed. The dealer deals 18 cards each picks up the remaining 4 cards and makes 4 discards. There are declarations of Ten Taroks, full and half Cavallerie, Four Kings and Three or more Matadors. There are three bids: Frage, Mediateur and Solo. In a Frage the declarer calls for a King that he doesn't have and that player becomes his partner. In Mediateur he plays alone but may call for one card and in Solo he goes it entirely alone.  Notelist   References   Literature  * _. (1783). Das neue K√∂nigliche l'Hombre. Hamburg: Herold. * _.

It lew in 1916 but little is known of its subsequent history. Design and development Very little is known about the V I. It was designed by Claude Dornier, then with Zeppelin-Werke Lindau GmbH and first flew in November 1916. Even its intended role and number of seats are uncertain. The V I was a two bay sesquiplane, its lower wing both shorter and narrower than the upper one. Both had roughly rectangular plans, though the upper tips were rounded. Two steel tube, V-form interplane struts braced the upper and lower wing spars together across an unusually small interplane gap. The wings had Dornier's preferred metal spars and ribs and were fabric covered. A pusher configuration aircraft, the V I was powered by a Maybach Mb.III engine placed, partially exposed, at the rear of the forward fuselage. This was a smooth ovoid aluminium sheet structure and contained at least one cockpit just behind the nose. Behind the wing trailing edges the fuselage was an uncovered steel tube structure, rectangular in cross-section. Its upper and lower taibooms were mounted on the wings at the top and bottom of the inner interplane struts, far enough apart to provide clearance for the propeller. It narrowed aft to the tail, which, like the wings, had surfaces with fabric covering over metal structures. A trapezoidal fin was mounted between the converging fuselage members, where the final vertical tube served as the rudder post and carried a rectangular rudder. The horizontal tail was mounted on the upper fuselage, braced with V-struts to the lower booms ahead of the rudder post. Its undercarriage was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on a single axle supported at each end by a V-strut to the lower fuselage. There was a small tailskid below the rudder post. Operational history The V I first flew in November 1916 but nothing further is known.

Description Eucalyptus nebulosa is a tree that typically grows to a height of and has smooth bark that is creamy white when fresh. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, the same greyish blue colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole up to long. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, pale bluish grey and glaucous, narrow elliptical, mostly long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of mostly seven, nine or eleven on a peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped, with a conical floral cup long, and an operculum long. Flowering occurs from December to March and the fowers are pale creamy white. The fruit is a woody hemispherical or slightly top-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus nebulosa was first formally described in 2008 by Alan Maurice Gray in the journal Kanunnah, from a specimen collected north of the Pieman Road about west of the Huskisson River. The specific epithet (nebulosa) is from the Latin nebulosus meaning \\"misty\\" or \\"cloudy\\", referring to the smoky or hazy effect of the bluish grey leaves from a distance.

This groups the 16Y, as an limited stop routes, while all other 16 lines are local routes which serves all stops in Columbia Pike. Alongside with the addition of MetroExtra Better Bus program, it brings more reliable service on the 16Y when more times was added throughout the years. =April 7, 2003 Changes= Starting on April 7, 2003, the 16Y added service to the Arlington County Department of Human Services (DHS)/Sequoia at South Courthouse Road and 2nd Street South. This stop became a \\"Boarding Only\\" during morning peak periods, and \\"Boarding and Alighting Only\\" during afternoon peak periods. From the addition of the stop, the 16Y eliminated the alighting only stop at the neighborhood of Penrose on Columbia Pike, as the 16Y will no longer run on Washington Boulevard, south of Walter Reed Drive. =June 27, 2010 Changes= The 16Y began to add more service through South Courthouse Road. The 16Y started to serve on the intersection of 6th Street South to bring more stops to the route. As the DHS/Sequoia stop at 2nd Street South is a Boarding Only stop on morning peak period, this new stop allows access to DHS/Sequoia by walking. =September 30, 2012 Changes= The 16Y began to add service through Lyon Park and Fort Myer near Arlington Boulevard, by adding more stops to bring more service on the 16Y. The DHS/Sequoia stop is no longer a Boarding Only stop on morning peak hours, after service on Washington Boulevard and Arlington Boulevard was added. Alongside these changes, the 16Y now operates near Fort Myer on Arlington Boulevard and North Pershing Drive. Unlike its original timetable, this stop is both Boarding and Alighting during peak hours. = September 2020 proposed changes = On September 10, 2020 as part of its FY2022 proposed budget, WMATA proposed to eliminate route 16Y service in order to reduce costs and low federal funds. If this proposal succeeds, there will be no MetroExtra routes left in Virginia. Route 16Y has not operated since March 13, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

History  The union was formed on February 8, 1968, by a group of African-American clergy who met in St. Philip's Episcopal Church to identify the church with the growing Black Power movement in their communities. The desire to articulate the problems of minority populations had been expressed by the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity. However, it was felt that its agenda was influenced largely by white Episcopalians, and did not necessarily express the aspirations of African-Americans. The organization meets annually, and includes clergy and laity, men and women, without distinction. Chapters are organized by dioceses and are joined in regional groups to express local concerns more effectively. The goals of the union are to help the church eradicate racism within its structure, to indicate the importance of an authentic African-American voice in decisions of diocesan and national governing bodies, to develop liturgical styles in worship, and to encourage and participate in the political and religious concerns of the African American community.  Membership  In 2018 there were 38 chapters within seven geographical regions. The Union of Black Episcopalians convenes an annual business meeting for all members.

Her murder remains unsolved.  Background  Vera Holland was born Vera Vince in London on 8 April 1949. She married Edward Bennett in 1967 with whom she had two children. Her second husband was Richard Stevens who she married in 1978 and the couple had one child together. She married her third husband, Brian Holland, in 1991. At the time of her death, Vera, 47, was living with her husband Brian, 41, on St Barnabas Road, Shinfield Rise, south Reading. The couple shared a milk delivery round in nearby Wokingham.  Disappearance  On the evening of Thursday 14 November 1996, Vera left her home at 6.10 pm to make a three- minute walk to the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant on Shinfield Road. The time of year meant that it was dark when she left. There was no sign of her on CCTV reaching her destination and it's believed that she never made it to the restaurant. Her husband, Brian, reported her missing at 10.45 pm when Vera failed to return home. At the time of her disappearance, Vera had been wearing a three-quarter length pink coat, green tartan skirt, black jumper and black shoes.  Discovery of the crime  Motorists on the A327 road, between Shinfield and Arborfield, alerted fire services to a blaze by the side of the road at 5.30 am on Saturday 16 November 1996 at an illegal fly-tipping site at Two Bridges. The site was about three miles south of Vera's home. Once the fire had been extinguished, Vera's body was discovered in a beige carpet on a pile of rubbish which included logs and tyres. Traces of her blood were found on the carpet and she was partially clothed in her undergarments: a suspender belt and petticoat. The post-mortem found that Vera had died of strangulation and there was bruising to her face. There was no sign of sexual assault. The other items of clothing which Vera had been wearing at the time of her disappearance were found in the burning pile.  Police investigation  Eighty police officers from Thames Valley Police were involved in the investigation into Vera Holland's death in the first year. At the height of the investigation 1,669 people were interviewed and 777 statements were taken. Over 100,000 leaflets appealing for information were sent out to local people. Fingerprint and blood tests were carried out on Brian Holland and the family home was sealed for three days while forensic teams searched the house, they took away over one hundred forensic samples. A week after Vera's disappearance, road checks were held on the A327 where Vera's body was found and a female police officer, dressed in clothing like Vera's on the night she disappeared, re-enacted the walk she would have made to the KFC restaurant in the hope that someone's memory would be jogged. A fortnight after Vera's disappearance, further road checks were carried out on the A327. In February 1997, police put up two road signs in the area where Vera's body was found, appealing for information. Witness statements provided police with a number of leads regarding vehicles in the area at the time: * Two sightings of a light- coloured Ford Fiesta shortly after 5am on Saturday 16 November near the entrance to Hall Farm, just the other side of a bridge from the site where Vera's body was found. One witness said the car was white, another said it was beige. It was seen to drive off at speed on to the farm estate. * A white Transit van seen several times for lengthy spells on Friday 15 November in the location where Vera's body was found. * A black Ford Granada was seen in the area on the night when Vera went missing.  The carpet  In February 1997, the police made an appeal for more information about the carpet which Vera‚Äôs body was found in. It was a section of bedroom quality carpet measuring 9ft 4in by 8ft 2in square and was fawn coloured / beige. It had two furniture sized indentations on one side ‚Äì possibly from matching pieces of bedroom furniture - and two radiator pipe holes on the opposite side. Soil and weeds growing on the carpet led police to believe that it had been stored outside before. Police believed that Vera‚Äôs body had been left inside the carpet for more than a day before it was taken to the fly-tip ‚Äì they believed she was killed and then placed in the carpet until the Friday evening. Witnesses stated that Vera‚Äôs body was not at the site before 4pm on Friday 15 November. After the appeal was made, police said that almost forty people contacted them with information about the carpet.  Arrests  On 17 December 1996, at 6.30am, Vera's second husband, Richard Stevens, 50, and his wife, Kaye, 42, were arrested. Mr and Mrs Stevens lived just a few houses from Vera and her husband, Brian. The couple were held for 13 hours then released on police bail. In January 1997, Vera's husband, Brian, was arrested in connection with her death. He was held for a day before being released on police bail. In March 1997, Brian Holland threatened to take legal action against Thames Valley Police over the handling of his wife's case. No one else has been arrested or charged in connection with Vera Holland's death.  Funeral and inquest  On Friday 20 June 1997, Vera Holland's funeral was held at Caversham Crematorium, Reading. On 16 October 1997, the inquest into Vera's death recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. The East Berkshire coroner, Robert Wilson, told the inquest, \\"It looks like the person who did this will get away with it.\\"  Developments in recent years  In November 2016, on the twenty year anniversary of Vera's death, two of her children made a new appeal for information alongside Thames Valley Police. When asked at the time about a possible connection of Vera's death with imprisoned serial killer, Christoper Halliwell, the head of Thames Valley police's major crime review team, Peter Beirne, responded that he would, \\"keep Halliwell in mind\\". In January 2017, Thames Valley Police announced that new witnesses had come forward leading to further investigations, but no arrests had been made.

Biography  Ti Ying was the youngest of Chunyu Yi's five daughters. Her father was originally a low ranking official, but after studying with a famous doctor, he was promoted to high rank. Ti Ying grew up to be very humble and generous thanks to her father's example, treating everyone equally, regardless of whether the person was of common birth or of the nobility. However, after her father couldn't save the life of a noblewoman, the devastated husband claimed that it was Chunyu Yi's treatment that caused the death of his wife. As this nobleman was very influential at that time, Chunyu Yi was taken away without a proper investigation. When Chunyu Yi was taken away, he knew he would be subjected to one of the Five Punishments. Knowing that he had no one who could appeal for him, he looked at his daughters and said \\"‚ÄúI will be sent to the capital for punishment where no woman can follow and I have five daughters. If only I had a son!‚Äù In the pre-modern China, women did not have a say in the court nor in society, unless they had some sort of special status. After hearing what her father said, Ti Ying made up her mind and followed her father on a journey to the capital. On the journey there she endured pain and hunger. Once she arrived at the capital, she made an appeal on behalf of her father to Emperor Wen himself instead of going to any of the officials. She made the appeal despite knowing that, as a young girl, her appeal would likely be treated with derision and even seen as improper conduct. She also took a novel approach in her appeal. Instead of her writing about her father's good nature and accomplishments to show he deserved leniency, as might have been expected, she instead wrote about the legal tradition of Five Punishments, showing how cruel and unethical they were. After hearing that a young girl had written a letter of grievance to him, the Emperor was eager to read what the letter was about. In her letter, she wrote, \\"'Once a man is executed, he cannot come back to life. Once a man is mutilated, even if he proved to be innocent later, he would be disabled for life, and there is no way to reverse the suffering he experiences. Even if he wishes to start anew, he will be unable to do so. I have heard stories of how a son can redeem a father‚Äôs guilt,' she continued. 'As a daughter, I am willing to redeem my father‚Äôs sin by being your slave for the rest of my life. I beg you to spare him from this punishment, and thus he will have an opportunity to make a fresh start.'\\" Emperor Wen was deeply moved by Ti Ying's letter. Not only was it well written, it also pointed out the cruelty and unjust of the Five Punishments and how it did not give the convicted a chance to defend themselves. This letter also impressed many officials in the court. Many praised the way in which she endured hardships along with her father and was willing to become a slave in exchanged for her father's life. After reading this letter, Emperor Wen pardoned Ti Ying's father and declined her offer to become a slave, he also abolished the cruel Five Punishments standard. Soon the story of Ti Ying's bravery was spread around the country and many would wished to have a daughter like her.

As a self-taught scholar of African- American quilts, he helped bring attention to the field and especially to the quilts of Rosie Lee Tompkins. Leon was born in the Bronx in 1935, the son of first-generation Jews from Lithuania. He attended the High School of Music & Art, then entered Oberlin College before transferring to Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology in 1958. He then earned a master's from the University of Chicago, where he trained in Reichian psychotherapy. In the late 1950s and early '60s, he was briefly married to his college girlfriend, although they both knew he was gay. Sometime after that he changed his first name to Eli and settled in Oakland, California. An obsessive collector, Leon became a regular at flea markets in and around Oakland, where his main focus became African-American quilts. He became an expert on the subject, traveling to Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas to conduct research. In 1989, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to continue his research. Leon organized a number of exhibitions across the United States, for which he wrote the catalogs: * Who'd a Thought It: Improvisation in African- American Quiltmaking (San Francisco Craft & Folk Art Museum, c. 1987) * Models in the Mind: African Prototypes in American Patchwork (Winston-Salem, N.C.: Diggs Gallery: Winston-Salem State University, c. 1992) * Arbie Williams Transforms the Britches Quilt (Regents of the University of California and the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery, UCSC, 1993) * \\"Showing up\\": Maximum-Contrast African-American Quilts (Richmond, CA: Richmond Art Center, 1996) * Something Else to See: Improvisational Bordering Styles in African-American Quilts (University of Massachusetts at Amherst, c. 1997) * No Two Alike : African- American Improvisations on a Traditional Patchwork Pattern (Columbia, S.C.: South Carolina State Museum, c. 1998) * Something Pertaining to God (Shelburne, VT: Shelburne Museum, 2006) * Accidentally on Purpose: The Aesthetic Management of Irregularities in African Textiles and African- American Quilts (Davenport, Iowa: Figge Art Museum, 2007) Upon his death in 2018 in Emeryville, California, Leon bequeathed his collection of almost 3000 African-American quilts, including more than 500 by Rosie Lee Tompkins, to the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA), whose director, Lawrence Rinder, worked closely with Leon to organize the first solo exhibition of Tompkin's work in 1997. The bequest will account for about 15 percent of the museum's art collection.

Robert Isaac Jones (1813 - 7 March 1905), also known under his bardic name Alltud Eifion, was a Welsh pharmacist, writer, and printer. Biography Y Brython, Jones' ill-fated newspaper. Jones was born at Tyddyn Iolyn, Pentrefelin, Gwynedd in 1813. Here he was educated and, in 1831, moved to become an apprentice to a Pwllheli pharmacist. After this he moved to Caernarvon and London, before settling in Tremadoc. In 1838, Jones opened his Tremadoc pharmacist, the Cambrian Pill Dep√¥t. He gained some fame as the peddler of \\"Tremadoc Pills\\", which he claimed as an effective medicine for many different illnesses. Jones was a keen printer, starting a Tremadoc printing-press where he printed several Welsh-language publications. He began a weekly newspaper, entitled Y Brython, in November 1858. This enterprise was unsuccessful, as it was reduced to a monthly publication by 1859, and ceased publication altogether in 1863, having obtained too little readership. Jones also published a biography of early black Welsh gardener, John Ystumllyn (d. 1786), collated from his family and local area's oral sources. This biography has proved invaluable to modern efforts to understand Ystumllyn. Ystumllyn's biographer, Andrew Green, admitted that, while \\"prone to variation, embroidery and forgetfulness\\", it survives as the most informative\\" and \\"frank\\" account of Ystumllyn's life. Jones was also an active eisteddfodwr, an attendee of annual Welsh literary festivals, though \\"did not excel\\", despite the copious amounts of poetry he produced, according to the Dictionary of Welsh Biography. Personal life and death Jones was initially a Methodist, but left the church for the local Anglican church. He contributed to several religious journals - Yr Haul, Y Llan, and Cymru - and briefly refounded a pre-existing church periodical, Baner y Groes. Jones founded a Sunday school in the Tremadoc town hall. Jones died on 7 March 1905, and was buried in St Cynhaearn's Church, Ynyscynhaearn.

Kulturhistorisches Museum Magdeburg, page 287. In the 13th century, the cameo was given an ornate gold and silver setting as well as a medallion on the reverse. The oval, engraved high relief depicts a goddess, either Pax Augusta or perhaps Felicitas, standing barefoot and leaning against a plinth with a cornucopia in her left arm and a caduceus in her right. Pax Augusta symbolizes peace in the Roman Empire, while Felicitas embodies luck and prosperity. She wears a jewel around her neck and a wreath of laurel and oak leaves on her head. In Roman religious symbolism, these insignia stand for victory and the saving of citizens' lives (see corona civica). The whole stone piece, measuring , is now dated to the first half of the 1st century CE, while the setting is thought to have been made around 1240. It is carved from layered sardonyx, a variety of quartz. The relief image has been carved from three differently coloured layers (dark- light-dark). The blue and brown onyx was probably originally worn as a brooch. Traces of fittings for this can be seen on the back of the gemstone. It has the museum inventory number 16375 and is located in the middle of the Kreuzsaal on the 2nd floor of the north wing. Before a renovation of the permanent collection in 2010, it was displayed in the \\"Treasure Chamber\\" of Michaelskapelle in the choir area. Description =The cameo= The figure's face is in profile, with her head and eyes turned slightly downward and her short hair pulled back. She wears a sheer, floor-length dress girt under her bust with her right shoulder bare. A heavier cloth garment is draped around her hips and held in place by her right arm on the plinth. The cameo has a later gold setting with 54 gems, semi-precious stones and also pearls; these are mainly sapphire, turquoise, garnet and lapis lazuli, of which three are missing. From certain angles, several figures of eagles and lions can be seen in the gold rim. It is noticeable that the edging with gemstones was done very evenly. There are four similar stones in each quarter arc of the rosette, resulting in a total of 16 pieces. Three such inner rows thus total 48 pieces, while the outer wreath alternately holds different stones, also for a total of 16 pieces. In addition, there are 16 small beads alternately placed in each case. =The falconer medallion= The silver falconer in silver on the reverse The back consists of a silver-gilt plate, on which a standing figure, possibly a knight, was engraved \\"in a long, pleated house dress with cloak and breastplate, a floral wreath on the head and a falcon on the gloved left hand\\". The background is filled with rhombus and cross devices. The inscription reads ‚ú†COMITIS LVDIWICI DE VROBURC, or '(possession) of Count Ludwig of Froburg', with the initial cross as an invocation. The text starts at the top and runs clockwise around the falconer, with a cap height of . This text was probably altered in the 16th century, under circumstances to disguise ownership. The changes were made by changing the existing capital letters by additional lines to other letters, which, however, makes no sense. The modified text is ‚ú†OOMETRS DWDDIWIOI DE VKOBUKO. Nevertheless, the original lettering can be reconstructed quite well. The representation as a falconer would suit Frederick II, whose territory included Sicily, because he owned falcons and wrote the book De arte venandi cum avibus ('On the art of hunting with birds'), but probably depicts Count Louis (or Ludwig) III or his son, Count Louis IV. It is also possible that the engravings were the work of successive generations: the falconer as the oldest design element would then have emerged under Emperor Frederick II, and the inscription under Count Louis III or IV. In this case, the person depicted might represent the then owner Frederick II, despite the inscription's implication that it was the likeness of one of the two Counts. The seals used by Louis III (died 1256/1259) and Louis IV use the same design but with the additional word SIGILLVM. Side view of the setting  Ownership history  It is now impossible to determine the origin or the artist of the cameo, or the way in which the gemstone came into the possession of Frederick II, the earliest owner currently known. Frederick II had extensive possessions and a lively interest in art. According to Kettler, the gold setting was possibly added in a Strasbourg workshop, a sign of the esteem in which such antiquities were then held. According to Knoepfli, Louis III or Louis IV of Frohburg called as another owner. The Bildindex der Kunst und Architektur considers it \\"booty from the Battle of Grandson\\". In 1279, the cameo‚Äîincluding the gold mount and the engraving on the back‚Äîcame into the possession of the widow of Henry III, , by gift or inheritance. She entered the near Schaffhausen that same year. With the Reformation, the convent's treasures and archives, including the cameo, passed into municipal ownership. It can be traced in the city's archives starting in 1616 with the description Ein Goldin Klainot mit Edelgestainen Versetz N.N. genandt ('a gold jewel with a precious stone setting named N.N.'); starting in 1740 it is referred to simply as \\"Onyx\\". In 1799, the historian Johannes von M√ºller kept it in his writing desk. With the loss of Schaffhausen's city status, the onyx came into the possession of the canton and was housed in the state archives. Despite several attractive purchase inquiries, it was not sold and has been on permanent loan in the exhibition of the Museum zu Allerheiligen since 1928. Since then, it has left the museum only for the in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Magdeburg in 2006. Assessment The jewel belongs squarely in the tradition of Greek and Roman craftsmanship. Over many centuries, similar representations can be found, which differ only slightly from each other. Ptolemaic princess with sceptre and double cornucopia with diadem, carnelian intaglio and gold setting with garnets and green glass. The technique of engraving cameos, probably originating from the Arab world, was adopted and varied by ancient artisans. In place of agate, they later used other layered stones, which, when worked in the right position, produce haunting works of art in the smallest of spaces. The goldsmith's work, probably from a Strasbourg workshop, is comparable to many other pieces of this time, both in terms of equipment and craftsmanship. It may be compared to works of sacred art as well as to the so-called Wettinger Prachtkreuz or processional cross from the abbey of Wettingen-Mehrerau, which has the same external decoration.

Description Poleo Formation (tan sandstone beds at top) resting on Salitral and Shinarump Formations. West of Abiquiu, New Mexico. The Poleo Formation is a cliff- forming formation composed mostly of yellowish-gray fine to medium sandstone, but with up to 20% conglomerate. The sandstone shows cross bedding and cuspate ripples. It resembles the Shinarump Conglomerate and the two formations can be difficult to distinguish where the Salitral Formation is absent. However, the Poleo Formation is finer grained and shows other distinguishing lithological features. The lower contact with the Salitral Formation is sharp and scoured, while the upper contact with the Petrified Forest Formation is gradational. The Poleo Formation has an inverse thickness relationship with the Salitral that suggests the thick sections fill valleys cut into the Salitral. The formation is exposed throughout the Chama basin, the Nacimiento, and Jemez Mountains of New Mexico. It divides the lower and upper Chinle Group where present, but rapidly pinches out to the south, where the underlying Salitral Formation becomes indistinguishable from the overlying Petrified Forest Formation.Stewart et al. 1972 The Poleo Formation is at the same stratigraphic position as the Trujillo Formation of West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the Sonsela Member of the Petrified Forest Formation in west-central New Mexico and northeastern Arizona, and the Moss Back Formation of southern Utah and southwestern Colorado. All are extensive sandstone sheets, but the Poleo Formation is distinguished by its great local thickness, grayish-yellow color, and lithology of micaceous litharenite and mixed-clast conglomerate. Fossils The formation is almost devoid of fossils, yielding only oxidized fragments of petrified wood and indeterminate vertebrate bone that are unusable for biostratigraphy. History of investigation Huene described the unit in 1911, giving it the name \\"Poleo-top-sandstone\\" as the caprock of Mesa Montosa (which he knew as \\"Mesa Poleo\\").Lucas et al. 2005 During their petroleum survey in 1946, Wood and Northrop formally named it the Poleo sandstone lentil of the Chinle Formation.Wood and Northrop 1946 Lucas and Hunt renamed the unit the Poleo Formation in the same 1992 study in which they raised the Chinle Formation to group rank.Lucas and Hunt 1992 Footnotes References  * Category:Triassic formations of New Mexico ","title":"Poleo Formation"},{"id":"62317532","text":"Mary Lois Jotter Cutter (1914‚Äì2013) was an American botanist. She and Elzada Clover were the first two non-Native women to raft the entire length of the Grand Canyon in 1938.  Early life and education  Born Mary Lois Jotter on March 11, 1914 in Weaverville, California, she was interested in science and botany from a young age. Her father, E.V. Jotter, a German Mennonite who taught forestry at the University of Michigan, and her mother, Artie May Lomb, encouraged her to study science while growing up in Michigan. She graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's degree in botany and biology and continued her studies in botany, obtaining a Doctorate from the University of Michigan in 1943. Her graduate studies focused on the cytogenetics of the evening primrose.  Grand Canyon Expedition  Jotter's mentor at the University of Michigan, Elzada Clover, invited her to join a boating expedition along the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon in the summer of 1938, during her graduate studies. The women planned to document and gather native plant species during the trip. At the time, only a few men had successfully boated down the Colorado and the only woman to do so, Bessie Hyde, disappeared and was presumed dead. Many of the women's colleagues and family members discouraged their participation in the trip due to the associated danger. The novelty of the women's involvement generated significant press coverage at the time, but articles tended to focus on the botanists' gender, appearance, and age rather than their scientific goals. The expedition departed Green River, Utah on June 20 with a plan to travel the Colorado River through the Cataract and Grand Canyons all the way to Lake Mead, Arizona - 666 miles. The group set out in three boats built by the trip organizer Norman Nevills - the Wen, the Botany, and the Mexican Hat - June 20, 1938. Other members of the group included: Eugene Atkinson, a zoology graduate student at the University of Michigan, Don Harris, an engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey, and Bill Gibson, an artist from San Francisco. The first half of the trip was plagued by conflict and Nevills sent Atkinson home during a stop at Lee's Ferry. It took the group 43 days total (36 of those were spent on the river) to travel from Green River to Lake Mead, a few days more than expected, partially due to frequent stops so Jotter and Clover could gather specimens. At one point, the Coast Guard sent out a plane to search for the group. They were found and signaled all was well. The expedition ended on August 1, 1938 to much fanfare and press coverage. The Associated Press headline stated \\"Women Make Perilous Trip Through Colorado Gorges\\". During the expedition, Jotter and Clover recorded and gathered the diverse plant species along the river. They traveled with handmade plant presses - layers of newspaper, blotting paper, and newspaper, cinched tight with leather straps. In her trip logbook, Jotter wrote, \\"we collected furiously.\\" In 1941, Jotter and Clover published a paper on the cactus they found, as well as a comprehensive plant list. In their publications, they identified four new species of cactus: Grand Canyon claret cup (Echinocereus canyonensis); small flower fishhook cactus (Sclerocactus parviflorus); strawberry hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus decumbens); and an elongated variety of beavertail prickly pear (Opuntia longiareolata). Their research was the only botanical survey of the Colorado River documenting the diverse plant life before the Glen Canyon Dam significantly altered it beginning in 1966.  Career and later life  Jotter was an Assistant Professor of Biology at UNC-Greensboro from 1963 until she retired in 1984. In 1980, she returned to the Grand Canyon for a second time as part of a scientific expedition to study environmental change in the area. The group used Jotter and Clover's plant list from 1938 as the basis of their work to restore native species destroyed by the Glen Canyon Dam. Jotter died of congestive heart failure on April 30, 2013 in Greensboro, NC. At the time of her death at age 99, Jotter was the last surviving female member of the 1938 Grand Canyon expedition, as Clover had passed away in 1980.  Personal life  She married Guatemalan botanist Dr. Victor Cutter, Jr. in 1942, and they had two children, Ann and Vic Cutter. Her husband died in 1962.

Despite only running from March 13, 1884 to October 1884, it was one of the first and most important publications of the Nahda. It was directed toward the Islamic Ummah, and called upon it to unite. It also took a firm stance against European colonialism, and it was banned by British authorities in Egypt and India. Name Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa is an Arabic term with religious significance, appearing twice in the Quran.  First publication  Jamal-al-Din Afghani advocated Islamic unity in the face of an increasingly stronger Christian Europe. Muhammad Abduh was an Islamic modernist and rationalist, or Mu øtazilite. It was started in a room in Paris, and the first edition was published on March 13, 1884, corresponding with 15 JumƒÅdƒÅ al-≈™lƒÅ, 1301. The first page contained the following:  Goals  The Imam Muhammad Abduh summarized the main goals of the magazine in a speech he sent to his friend, the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt: protecting the independence of Eastern peoples from the aggression of Western countries, and to discomfort the English government to the point where it rescinds its activities that perturb Muslims. Also among the goals of the magazine, as can be ascertained from its editorial line: a call to unite and stand in solidarity, and to embrace the Nahda, and to liberate Egypt and Sudan from British colonialism.  Censorship  Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa was banned by British authorities in Egypt and India, and an elaborate network including Arab businessmen in Bombay disseminated copies throughout the Arab world.  End of publication  Muhammad Abduh and JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-AfghƒÅnƒ´ decided to end the magazine in October 1884 after publishing 18 editions over the course of 8 months, probably due to financial problems resulting from the ban.  Legacy  Some issues of Al-Urwah al- Wuthqa were found in the library of Dar al-Arab publishers, in addition to some other writings and speeches of Muhammad Abduh and JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al- AfghƒÅnƒ´.

Ascension is one of the largest health-care systems in the United States with comprehensive and specific health care information of millions who are part of its system. The project is Google's attempt to gain a foot hold into the healthcare industry on a large scale. Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, inc. are also actively advancing into health care, but none of their business arrangements are equal in scope to Project Nightingale. History In early 2019, Ascension began talks with Google about developing health aggregation software to store and search medical records. The two companies signed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) business associate agreement, which would allow Ascension to transfer patient data to Google Cloud, and would bar Google from using this data for purposes other than providing services to Ascension. Google first mentioned its project with Ascension in a July 2019 earnings call, which said the partnership was meant to \\"improve the healthcare experience and outcomes.\\" The Wall Street Journal first reported on \\"Project Nightingale\\" on November 11, 2019, writing that doctors and patients had not been notified of the project and that 150 Google employees had access to patient data. Google Health chief David Feinberg responded to the report in a blog post, saying all employees with access to protected health information went through medical ethics training and were approved by Ascension. The project raised privacy fears because of Google's involvement in other privacy controversies, like DeepMind's medical data- sharing controversy and a lawsuit against Google and the University of Chicago Medical Center for allegedly processing identifying medical records. Google Cloud executive Tariq Shaukat wrote that patient data gathered from the project \\"cannot and will not be combined with any Google consumer data.\\" Types of data The data sharing includes patient names and their dates of birth, along with doctor diagnoses, lab results, and hospitalization records, amounting to access to complete electronic health records. Also included in the data sharing are addresses of the patient, family members, allergies, immunizations, radiology scans, medications, and medical conditions. After the patient checks in to the doctor's office, or hospital, or senior center - the doctor and nurse examination results are entered into a computer and uploaded to Google's cloud servers. At this point, the system is then used to suggest treatment plans, recommend replacement or removal of a doctor from the patient's health-care team, and administer policies on narcotics. Ascension, the company sharing data with Google, may also vary their billing according to treatment or procedures. Investigations Soon after The Wall Street Journal reported on Project Nightingale, The Guardian published an account from an anonymous whistleblower who worked on Project Nightingale. This person who raised concerns that patients could not opt in or out of having their records stored on Google's servers, and that the project may not be HIPAA compliant. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) launched an inquiry into Google's partnership with Ascension. The investigation will be run by HHS' Office of Civil Rights. Director Roger Severino said, his office \\"would like to learn more information about this mass collection of individuals' medical records with respect to the implications for patient privacy under [the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPAA].\\" See also *Google Health References External links *Our Partnership with Ascension, Google Cloud blog post and FAQ Category:2019 establishments in the United States Category:2019 controversies in the United States Category:Healthcare in the United States Category:Catholic health care Category:Code names Category:Google Cloud Category:Electronic health records Category:Medical controversies in the United States Category:Projects established in 2019 ","title":"Project Nightingale"},{"id":"62317759","text":"Shah Azizur Rahman (died 17 September 2018) was a Bangladesh Awami League politician and a Jatiya Sangsad member from the Sylhet-2 constituency.

He is a member of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement in Bolivia, and has been the chair of the Civic Committee of Santa Cruz since 2019. He emerged as a major critic of Evo Morales in the 2019 Bolivian general elections, demanding Morales resign on 5 November 2019.  Early life and education  Camacho comes from a family involved in business. He is the son of Jos√© Luis Camacho Parada, who previously presided over the Civic Committee of Santa Cruz. Camacho Parada was also the president of the Santa Cruz Federation of Private Businesses from 1992 to 1993. Camacho studied Law at the Private University of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. He graduated with a law degree in 2003. In 2005, he completed a master's degree in Financial and Tax Law at the University of Barcelona in Spain. Camacho married Gabriela Antelo Miranda in September 2019.  Activism  In 2002, Camacho joined the centrist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement party of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. He served as the vice-president of the far-right Santa Cruz Youth Union from 2002 to 2004. Camacho was inactive between 2004 and 2013, when he became the second vice-president of Provincial Civic Committees of the Cruce√±idad, a post he held until 2015. In 2017, he assumed the role of first vicepresidente of the Civic Committee, which he occupied until 2019. In February 2019, Camacho was elected President of the Civic Committee of Santa Cruz for the 2019-2021 with 234 votes, replacing former president Fernando Cu√©llar N√∫nez.  2019 protests  During the November 2019 protests that erupted in Bolivia in response to electoral fraud alleged by the Organization of American States, Camacho took leadership of principal opposition in the Santa Cruz region to protest against Evo Morales. Camacho attempted to present himself as the leader of the anti-governmental opposition, although in reality this opposition included a broad array of social groups expressing grievances with Morales's ruling party and distrust in the electoral process. After President Evo Morales fled to Cochabamba, Camacho went to the old Government Palace and put down a Bible and a symbolic letter that renounced Morales. Camacho declared: \\"I don't go with weapons, I go with my faith and my hope; with a Bible in my right hand and his letter of resignation in my left hand.\\" A pastor who was present was recorded saying that \\"the Bible has re-entered the palace. Pachamama will never return.\\" Camacho pressed the police as well as the military to join the protests against Morales.  2019 Bolivian political crisis  According to Bolivian political scientist Marcelo Equipo, the platform of Bolivia's interim government has been derived from Camacho's political agenda. Camacho's lawyer was appointed as Minister of the Presidency of Jeanine A√±ez's interim government. Following the crisis, Camacho joined the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement and announced his candidacy to 2020 election with Marco Pumari as his vice-presidential candidate.  Political views  In Bolivia, Camacho has a reputation as a conservative Catholic figure, https://time.com/5728279/luis-fernando-camacho- bolivia/https://exchange99.com/2019/11/15/how-bolivias-evo-morales-was- introduced-down-with-the-assist-of-an-obscure-conservative-with-a-bible/ known for his extensive criticisms of the Evo Morales presidency.

According to some sources, the operation continued until 1958. Its goal was to capture citizens who attempted to defect from socialist Czechoslovakia to West Germany, across the Iron Curtain. The plan was initiated in the aftermath of the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'etat, in which the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, with Soviet backing, seized control of the government of Czechoslovakia. Background After the communist coup of February 1948, thousands of opponents of the communist regime tried to escape the country. Although the border was guarded, in the year after the coup approximately 10,000 people -- including 50 prominent politicians -- escaped. In response to this, the Czechoslovak secret police, also known by the Czech acronym StB, set up parts of the country's border fortifications about 50 km away from the actual border with the American occupation zone in West Germany. The idea of using a false border to catch defecting refugees has been traced to Anton√≠n Prchal, a colonel of the StB. Implementation False border crossings were constructed in the areas of A≈°, Cheb, Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ, Chodsk√Ω √öjezd, Doma≈ælice, Kdynƒõ, and V≈°eruby. The false crossings consisted of signs, border stones, administrative buildings, and guardhouses. Similar arrangements had been used by the Gestapo of Nazi Germany and the NKVD of the Soviet Union. The StB used the fake border crossings to catch and arrest would-be refugees who believed they had crossed into the safety of democratic West Germany. In many cases, the victims had been encouraged to flee the country by undercover StB agents posing as members of the underground anti-communist opposition. At the fake border post, the refugees were introduced to another StB agent posing as a smuggler or a bribed border guard, who offered to lead the refugees into the forest and across the border at night in exchange for payment. After crossing the fake border, refugees were welcomed and interviewed by supposed agents of the US Counter Intelligence Corps. In these interviews the refugees were asked about their connections to and knowledge of the anti-communist opposition in Czechoslovakia; in many cases, the refugees willingly told the \\"Americans\\" about members of their family or social circle who would support the overthrow of the communist regime, in the belief that the Americans could provide assistance to those family or friends. In this way the StB learned the identities of other opponents of communist rule, who were imprisoned along with the would-be refugees. After the interviews with the fake American agents, the operation could follow different scripts. In most cases, refugees were instructed bring transcripts of their interviews to another American post. On their way the refugees would be discovered and arrested by Czechoslovak border guards. Once caught in this way, the refugees could not claim to be innocent, since they carried signed statements describing their anti-communist views and activities. Many victims believed that every stage of the operation was genuine, and their capture was a result of straying too close to the Czechoslovak border after getting lost in the forest on the West German side. In some other cases, the StB agents posing as Americans would inform the refugees that their asylum applications had been rejected, and turn them over to the Czechoslovak border guards. This was done so that, when these attempted refugees returned to Czechoslovakia, they would spread the news that they had been betrayed by the US. The spread of such news in prisons and in the rest of society was intended to convince the population that the US was not genuinely supportive of the anti-communist cause and that there was no hope of successful escape. Regardless of how the operation proceeded, the victims were sentenced to prison or hard labor. Some received life sentences, and some were sentenced to death; others were released after sentences of 15-20 years. In many cases, the victims' property and possessions were confiscated by the StB officers involved, who sold these for personal gain. End of the Operation The US learned of the false border operation from Stanislav Liska, the chief of police in V≈°eruby, who since 1945 had been part of a network in Czechoslovakia sharing intelligence with the US.

History The Board of Governors was created in 1971 under Governor Bob Scott, replacing a previous system that was composed of a 100 person board that managed 6 state funded universities, and a State Board of Higher Education that managed 9 other universities. This centralized the governance of all public universities in the state by creating a 32 member board of governors for the UNC System, a board of trustees and chancellor for each university.

Early life  Alphonse Nguvulu was born on 19 September 1922 in Vista, Belgian Congo. He worked as a chief clerk for the Office of Secondary Technical Schooling and was a member of the Association du Personnel Indigene de la Colonie, a labour union.  Political career  Nguvulu was ideologically a Marxist socialist and served as president of Action Socialiste, a Congolese political party. He took a Marxist approach to analysing colonisation, stating that Africans were economically exploited for their labour and subject to racial discrimination because they were black. In 1958 Nguvulu signed the \\"Motion to the Minister of the Belgian Congo\\", which demanded that Belgium grant the Congolese independence. Later that year he co- founded the Mouvement National Congolais, a nationalist Congolese political party. On 26 April 1959 he co-founded the socialist Parti du Peuple (PP) with other members of Action Socialiste and became its president. He resigned from the MNC to devote his political activities to the PP. Since the Belgian colonial administration had acquiesced to the concept of Congolese independence, Nguvulu believed that the MNC had succeeded in its original mission. He thus thought that the organisation should dissolve and that its members should become socialists, since socialism could provide the Congolese with a more specific platform for independence and social progress. In early 1960 he participated in the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels as a delegate for the PP. At his insistence, the Belgians and the Congolese held a subsequent Economic Round Table Conference to discuss the economic matters regarding Belgian decolonisation of the Congo. While there he advocated that the Belgian government assume partial responsibility for the Congo's debt and rejected the proposal of the Congo's participation in the European Economic Community. In April he attended the Belgian Communist Party Conference in Li√®ge, maintaining that he was only there as an observer. Later that year the Belgian Congo became independent as the Republic of the Congo. The MNC leader and Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba, appointed Nguvulu Secretary of State for Economic Coordination and Planning in his government. The government was officially invested by Parliament on 24 June. On 17 April 1963 he was appointed by Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula as Minister of Labour and Social Welfare. In June 1964 he devised a plan for resolving the Congo Crisis, which involved the institution of a new transitional government, the creation of an economic and social council, and a roundtable discussion between different Congolese leaders. His tenure ended when the Adoula Government left office that month. In 1973 Nguvulu was appointed Zaire's first Ambassador to the People's Republic of China. He arrived in China on 19 May to take up his post.

Civic use of the building stopped in 1999, when the building was sold for business and residential use. Registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in 2003, the building was demolished in June 2011 following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. History The Lyttelton Borough Council was inaugurated in 1868 as a successor to the 1862 Lyttelton municipal council. In February 1886, a committee of borough councillors agreed to have outlined plans drawn up for a purpose-built civic office for the local administration. At the time, any loans that a council wanted to raise were subject to public approval and a public meeting was held in August 1886 to discuss raising a ¬£3,000 loan. The meeting was chaired by the mayor, Adam Chalmers, and the main speaker was Harry Allwright, a borough councillor and the local member of parliament. The issue was put to public vote as part of the borough councillor elections on 9 September 1886, where 442 electors supported the loan, with 26 against and 5 informal votes. The building was designed by the Christchurch architecture firm Collins and Harman and they first advertised a construction tender two weeks after the election where the loan was approved. Tenders were opened at the borough council meeting on 2 November 1886, with ten tenders received ranging in price from ¬£2,970 to ¬£4,270. The lowest tender, by local Lyttelton contractors Hollis, Williams, and Green, was accepted. The building was a two- storey brick structure. The ground floor was for a resident magistrate's court and associated offices. The upper storey was for use by the borough council. The largest rooms were the court room () and the borough council chamber (). The ceiling height was . The building had frontages onto Sumner Road (then known as London Street; ) and Oxford Street (). The height from the ground to the parapet was . Access to the court was via a centrally located door in Oxford Street, and the council offices could be reached via a door at the eastern end of the Sumner Road frontage. The foundation stone was laid on 29 January 1887, and Allwright having just been elected mayor, his name was engraved in that stone: > H. Allwright, Mayor, 1887 There was no formal opening for the building, but the first council meeting was held in the new building on 18 October 1887. As the ground floor was used as a court, the fitout of that floor was done by prison labour and completion of that floor took longer. Over time, the use of the court declined and in the end, the council chamber was used for court sittings, with borough council staff taking over the ground floor. With staff numbers continuing to increase, the borough council bought the Albion Hotel and shifted staff there in 1978. At that time, the Lyttelton Library moved from across the road into the former court premises. In 1991, council staff moved again, this time into the building of the Lyttelton Port Company. In 1999, the library was moved to its present building. Council placed a covenant on the building in 1999 and sold it to private interests for commercial use downstairs and residential use upstairs.

Toeboxes that do not fit can cause injuries and foot deformities. Toeboxes come in a variety of shapes and styles of construction, some of which are a matter of fashion, and some of which are designed for specialized functions. Fitting If the toes overhang when standing on the removed insole (right), then they will be cramped inside the toebox (left) A simple way to test if a toe box is too tight is to take out the insole and stand on it. If the toes overhang the insole, the toebox is too small. A toe box also needs enough extra room to accommodate movements of the foot, such as lengthening arches and toe splay. With each step, ankles and feet bend, toes spread and flex, and the arches of the foot flatten and rebound. Because the arches flatten, the foot lengthens and widens as it takes weight. Weight-bearing causes the foot to widen across the ball by up to . A foot with a higher longitudinal arch will lengthen more in use, and more room in font of the toes may be needed. When running, weight is shifted onto the ball and toes of the foot; the heel barely touches. A narrow toebox therefore hinders function more. High heels also shift weigh onto the toes. Problems Generally, toes should not touch toeboxes. Toeboxes that put pressure on the foot slowly produce permanent deformities; toe boxes that strike the toes cause bruising; and toeboxes that rub hurt the skin. =Joint deformities= Too-tight toeboxes can permanently deform the foot, weakening it enough to significantly impair function. Tight socks can have similar effects, especially if the foot is already fairly deformed. Roomy toeboxes which permit free movement help; the improvement depends on the amount and duration of the deformity, and the age of the patient. If too-narrow and too-short toeboxes have previously been worn, the muscles of the arches will be weaker; the foot may expand more, and the muscles may feel tired and painful until they strengthen. Foot exercize and broader shoes tend to thicken and widen the foot; a re-fitting after six months may be needed, although after that the shoe size of adults generally stabilizes. Bunions Shoes which put pressure on the outside edge of the big toe cause bunion (bending of the big toe sideways towards the other toes). Bunion prevention requires a shoe with a sole which does not taper on that side, so that the big toe can point in its natural direction. (this is the publication of a four-year review into the footwear of the US military by the Army Shoe Board, of which the author, a physician and senior officer of the United States Army Medical Corps, is president. His statements on flat feet are out of date, but on toeboxes, no significant work seems to have been done since) Any material bunion deformity appreciably weakens the foot; the sideways shift in the big toe decreases leverage and shifts weight-bearing. However, this deformity is very common. A bunionette, a similar bending of the little toe, is caused by a too-narrow toebox which puts pressure on the other side of the toes; it is not uncommon, but generally causes less impairment, as the little toe is less mechanically important. Women over 50 who remember wearing narrow toeboxes in their 20s and 30s are more likely to have foot pain and bunions. Hammertoes Tight toeboxes are the most common cause of hammertoes, mallet toes and claw toes. A too-small toebox forces the toes to bend; eventually, the ligaments in the top of the foot shorten, and the toes no longer relax to a straight position when taken out of the shoes. If the ligaments continue to tighten, it may become impossible to straighten the toes. Wearing wide, roomy toeboxes which are longer than the longest toe, and are not tight or painful anywhere, prevents and treats hammertoes. High heels can force the toes forwards against the ends of the toebox, so they should also be avoided. Shoes should fasten such that the toes do not slide into a collision with the end of the toebox, especially when going downhill. =Skin and nail problems= ease for arches to extend. Left: Proper fit Blisters and calluses Ill-fitting toeboxes can rub against the foot, causing blisters, and eventually calluses and corns. These often occur on the toes and the balls of the foot. Foot deformation and dysfunction can encourage calluses to form. Jogger's toes If the toebox does not have enough room around the toes, or the foot can slide forwards far enough to jam the toes into the end of the toebox, it can also cause black toenail (jogger's toe). The toes also need vertical space; a toe cap which is low enough to press on the top of the toe may also cause bruising under the nail, especially if the toe cap is stiff. If the toebox is pointed, the toes may be wedged forwards into the area with inadequate height. Ingrown toenails Narrow pointed shoes (or tight socks) can be a factor in causing ingrown toenails. Vertical profile Toes boxes are either structured (with a three-dimensional shape, often produced with a thermoplastic interlayer) or unstructured. Structuring mostly affects the depth of the toebox. Some moccasins have wide, unstructured toeboxes, somewhat loose on the foot, which allow toe splay. Many toe boxes also include toe spring, where the sole curves up towards the toes. When the shoe is flexible enough to bend with the foot, at the ball of the foot, this is not needed. Most toeboxes, at a point 5 cm from the tip, are ~44 mm deep, regardless of style. Especially wide and deep toeboxes may be used to provide space for foot deformities and foot orthotics. File:Boots, pair, man's (AM 1931.576-1).jpgA pair of boots with symmetrically-pointed unstructured square toeboxes. File:Lithuanian clogs.jpgAll-wooden clogs are rigid. While they are fairly foot-shaped inside, they often have bulky, pointed \\"duck-tail\\" external toeboxes, with substantial external toe spring File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-0097-02, Holtwick, M√§dchen auf dem Schulweg.jpg...this allows the shoes to rock forwards, so the foot can push off in a fairly normal gait Horizontal profile Toe boxes also come in various widths and horizontal- plane shapes. Foot-shaped toeboxes are rare. Most toe boxes are widest at the ball of the foot, then taper towards the toes, although the foot widens from the base of the toes forwards. Toe boxes often taper symmetrically, from both sides; feet do not. If toebox taper is wide enough that it is outside the space needed by the foot, a tapered toebox can be comfortable. Many shoes have a toebox which is excessively narrow in relation to heel width; if a sufficiently wide toebox can be picked out, the shoe will often be loose on the heel. Some shoe manufacturers make \\"split sizes\\", where the toe and heel size are varied independently, on a combination last.

These ones have wide, asymmetrical, rounded toeboxes Split toeboxes Some toeboxes are split. Some are split into two pockets, like those of jika-tabi; others are split into more pockets. Five-pockets toeboxes can be difficult to fit, as each pocket may be too long, too short, too wide, or too narrow. Splitting the toebox helps allow toe splay and gripping.

His toes overlap, possibly due to overly-narrow toeboxes. An early-20th-century survey by the United States Army Medical Corps's Army Shoe Board found that less than five percent of the enlisted men had good feet, and attributed most of the problems to poor shoe fit (including civilian shoes). The toeboxes of the new military-issue shoes were therefore designed to fit mildly deformed rather than underformed feet. The Shoe Board recognized that fit would be imperfect, and recommended breaking in new shoes rapidly by standing in them in three inches of water for ~5 minutes, to soak the leather through, and then walking on a level surface outdoors for ~1 hour, or until the shoes have dried. Failing this, they suggested breaking them in by wearing them for initially short periods, progressively lengthened, to break in the shoe rather than the foot. They also recommended using special shoe stretchers with removable pegs to stretch the toeboxes wider, and stretch bumps over blisters, corns, and bunions. =Ballet= Toe box of a ballet shoe, a rigid shell tightly covered in satin. The flat platform at the end of the toebox bears the dancer's whole weight when en pointe. Ballet pointe shoes have highly specialized toeboxes, as the end of the toeboxes, called the platform, must bear a dancer's entire weight when dancing en pointe. This is a pressure of about 220 psi or 1.5 MPa. When a dancer leaps and lands en pointe, the higher transient load, acting on the same area, briefly creates a much higher pressure. The toebox is a rigid socket, built from layers of paper, glue, and fabric (usually burlap), and covered with a satin fabric. They sometimes contain plastic, but this tends to produce a stiff shoe and is not popular. The toe boxes start out too stiff to dance in, and must be broken in; after a certain amount of dancing, depending on technique and conditions, the toeboxes become too soft to support the foot. Reinforcement with fresh glue may postpone the date when the shoes must be replaced. The toebox must be carefully fitted. The width of the toe box must accord with the dancer's toe shape. When the dancer stand with the feet pointing straight ahead and parallel (sixth position), and bends their knees deeply without raising their heels from the floor (a demi-pli√©), the feet lengthen; the toes should just touch the platform when in this position. The top of the toebox should be long enough that the throat (edge) falls a bit beyond the far end of the third phalanx, covering it entirely. Dancers often wear specialized padding around and between their toes. Creasing A stiff, multipiece shoe with toe caps, which has been left on the last a long time, will crease less across the toebox. Leather quality has little effect. Using a shoe tree and a shoehorn will reduce creasing. Creasing is a cosmetic concern, but generally does not impair function.

The Reverend Dr. Earl D. Trent, Jr. currently serves as the church's Senior Pastor. The present day Florida Avenue Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.  History  Founded in 1912, the Florida Avenue Baptist Church traces its roots back to a group of 23 people who decided to withdraw their membership from the Vermont Avenue Baptist Church after a series of events took place between the years 1910 and 1911. Faced with the dilemma of finding another place to worship, the 23 people who named themselves \\"The Excelsior Circle\\" took turns meeting at each other's houses until on July 12, 1912, they decided to meet at what was then known as Winslow's Hall located between 12th & R Streets N.W., and formally organize their own church. Soon after organization, approximately 222 people joined the infant church. A church, then known as the Gurley Memorial Presbyterian Church, was for sale for $25,000 with an initial deposit of $2,000 required for purchase. With characteristic cooperation, each member cheerfully contributed, and on the fourth Sunday of December 1912, the first service was held in the newly acquired edifice. Florida Avenue Baptist Church continues to reside on the grounds of where the old church was purchased and has undergone reconstruction, expansion, and remodeling within a time span of over 100 years.  Pastorate  Reverend William A. Taylor, a young brilliant clergyman, accepted the call to become the church's first minister. Reverend Taylor was installed as pastor of Florida Avenue Baptist Church on April 12, 1913 and remained in this position until his death in 1937. Prior to his demise, Reverend Taylor was bestowed an honorary degree as Doctor of Divinity. Following the death of Reverend Taylor in the same year, the church called on Reverend Robert L. Rollins, a highly educated teacher and son of the church to become its second pastor. Under Reverend Rollins, Florida Avenue Baptist underwent a period of transformation. It enjoyed the influx of new members, forming of clubs, singing groups, and youth development programs. The old church was renovated and expanded to continue serving as the congregation's house of worship until July 1962, when Communion, Final Prayer, and Testimonial services were held for the last time under the old edifice. In November 1964, Florida Avenue Baptist Church dedicated its new building to the Glory of God while celebrating its 52nd anniversary and 26th pastoral anniversary of Reverend Rollins. An Educational Center, named in his honor, was built in addition to the new church. In 1971, Reverend Rollins along with the church was able to burn the mortgage on both the new church and the Robert L. Rollins Educational Building. In 1972, Reverend Rollins departed from this world and continues to be remembered as a visionary and pragmatic leader by those who worshiped the Lord under his leadership. Reverend Dr. Robert L. Rollins is recognized as Florida Avenue Baptist Church's longest serving pastor.  References  Category:Baptist churches in Washington, D.C.

It is located on the southern edge of the Darb al-Ahmar district in Cairo, Egypt, near the Citadel of Cairo and the former Bab al-Wazir gate. It did not serve its function as hospital very long and stood ruined for many years. Its facade and main walls have survived, and have been recently restored.  History  The maristan of al-Mu'ayyad (photographed in 2012) before recent restoration. The maristan was built on the site of the unfinished madrasa-mausoleum of Sultan al-Ashraf Sha'ban. Sha'ban had started building a monumental and lavishly-decorated mausoleum and madrasa for himself in 1375 but the building was still unfinished when he was assassinated in 1377. Since his mausoleum was incomplete, he was instead buried in the second mausoleum of the madrasa he had built to honour his mother (the Madrasa of Umm al-Sultan Sha'ban), which is located further down the main street in the Darb al-Ahmar neighbourhood. The unfinished structure was eventually dismantled by Sultan Faraj ibn Barquq in 1411 in order to reuse its materials for a number of other buildings, including the so-called Zawiya of Faraj ibn Barquq (located in front of Bab Zuweila) and the madrasa-mosque of his emir Jamal al-Din Ustadar. Sultan Faraj was assassinated in 1412 by rebellious Mamluk amirs and Mu'ayyad Sheikh eventually succeeded to the throne, reigning from 1412 to 1421. He was known as a relatively humble and pious ruler who spent little on himself. Nonetheless, he managed to erect many religious and secular buildings (including a large mosque) despite the unsettled political situation and the economic difficulties of Egypt at the time. He appropriated the site of Sha'ban's madrasa and built this maristan, even though a large bimaristan institution already existed as part of Sultan Qalawun's earlier complex at Bayn al-Qasrayn further north. It is likely that the foundations of Sha'ban's demolished religious complex were reused for the maristan, as the building's floor plan is aligned with the qibla (the direction of prayer). Parts of the unfinished madrasa's walls, which were reportedly very tall and impressive, were possibly also reused. If so, this may also explain why this maristan building was equally monumental and impressive, which was rare for such a civic building. Construction of the building began in July 1418 and was completed in August 1420. The famous Egyptian historian Maqrizi was present to see the construction. Unfortunately, al-Mu'ayyad died of illness the following year in 1421, before the building was able to properly begin its function as a hospital/maristan. In fact, it reportedly did not even provide services during the plague outbreak of 1419-1420. For a year, the building was inhabited by a group of Iranians then used by the Mamluk court as a guesthouse for ambassadors. In March 1422, under the reign of Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay, the building was turned into a Friday mosque (for which it was already well-suited, given its qibla alignment). Part of the foundation's failure to serve its intended function may be due to a lack of information and instructions outlined in the documents of its waqf (a charitable trust in Islamic law). The waqf document briefly described the maristan but provided no instructions for how the space should be used, what services should be offered, or what staff should operate it (in contrast with the highly detailed waqf documents of Qalawun's older maristan, which continued to operate even up to modern times). As a typical Mamluk foundation of this sort, the descendants of al-Mu'ayyad were also entitled to keep any income from the endowments which financed the foundation. As a result, they may have had an interest in cutting out operational costs for the hospital. Barsbay likely established a new endowment and trust for the conversion and operation of the building to a mosque. Over time, the building fell into disuse and then into ruin. Only its monumental facade and the walls of its main hall remained standing. It only received some attention In recent years. In 2005, the Supreme Council of Antiquities demolished some of the structures in front of the building to allow an unobstructed view of the facade. In the following years, the building was restored by the government as part of the Historic Cairo Restoration Project.  Description  Entrance portal of the maristan. The monumental building, despite falling into ruin over the years, is nonetheless one of the most impressive structures in historic Cairo. What remains today is mostly the facade and the walls of the main hall; the upper floors and interior of the building having collapsed or disappeared some time ago, along with some other outlying structures. The building is located on higher ground than most of the surrounding area. Its entrance is located on its southeastern side, facing northeast. This entrance leads to a vestibule, which then leads to a large courtyard or main hall around which the northwestern part of the building is centered. = Exterior facade = The unusual snake carvings around the columns of a window above the entrance. The maristan is set in an elevated position relative to the street in front of it and its entrance was originally reached by a spiral staircase (replaced by a regular staircase today). A sabil used to exist near the entrance, as did a school for orphans and a small mosque or oratory. The frontal facade is tall and imposing, and features a surprising richness of ornamentation and colour. Both here, on the exterior, and around the arches of the main hall/courtyard, are bands of carved stone that look like linked chains and serve to frame various elements of the architectural composition. The entrance is set within a monumental recessed portal crowned by a vault or canopy of muqarnas (stalactite-like carvings) within a rectangular frame that projects higher than the rest of the building's facade; all of which is typical of Mamluk architecture. The overall facade makes use of ablaq masonry (alternating dark red and light stone) masonry, but more elaborate ablaq patterns appear above the doorway. On both lateral (side) walls of the portal are two \\"roundels\\" of differing floral and geometric compositions created using red stone. Outside the portal, two even larger roundel patterns of this kind appear above the windows on either side of the portal. Between these and the portal are keel- shaped niches (originating from Fatimid architecture) with radiating red and light stone, below which are inscriptions in Arabic (in either thuluth or naskhi forms), formed with red paste or stone, which together appear to form the shahada. Further below these inscriptions are panels of \\"Square\\" Kufic script, formed with inlaid lapis lazuli blue tiles. One unusual detail is also found above the doorway: here, set along the middle of a double window, are two small decorative columns with carved snakes wrapping around them, which could be a symbol of healing. = Interior = The interior was ruined over time and little remains of the original structure other than the bare walls of the main halls, although it has recently been repaired and restored. Aside from the vestibule at the entrance, the interior is dominated by a rectangular central courtyard surrounded on four sides by iwans (chambers open on one side) that open though massive pointed arches framed by a band of carved stone (as mentioned above) resembling linked chains. The outer walls of the southwestern and northeastern iwans are distinguished by an unusually extensive arrangement of windows: four rectangular windows at the bottom, above which are four arched windows, above which in turn are six round windows stacked in a triangular formation. One set of these windows is visible on the outside of the building (in the section to the right of the main entrance). The original roofs of the building were be made of timber (wood). Beyond this, some of the building's original layout is known from the waqf documentation. The main courtyard had a central basin of water. Two of the iwans had wall fountains (shadirvans) from which water flowed down to the basin via small water channels in the floor (something also found in a courtyard of the maristan of Qalawun, and elsewhere in Islamic architecture). The other chambers of the complex included a ward for female patients, an oratory or prayer room, a pharmacy, and a kitchen. There was an upper floor with a number of rooms as well as a loggia or balcony.

Hyndman, whose \\"lush Victorian prose ably captures the eloquence, fervor and charm of this celebrated revolutionary classic.\\" =United States= In the United States, an edition was smuggled in by Charles H. Kerr in 1899, \\"in the wake of the great Anarchist's first U.S. speaking tour.\\" And yet, after going through the Kerr Press in 1910, it was still in reproduction with the Kerr pamphlets as late as 1930.

He also worked with other groups of fauna, especially arachnids. He had a strong impact on zoological studies at the University of Bergen. One biographer characterized Kauri as follows: \\"in all areas he created a professional stimulating environment for both young and older researchers. However, he was a very determined gentleman, who asserted his ideas and opinions with great strength.\\" Estonia and Sweden Kauri studied zoology at the University of Tartu in Estonia. He was interested in dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata). During this time he also worked on a manuscript, but it was lost in a fire during the Second World War. His doctoral dissertation on spiders (Arachnoidea) also suffered the same fate. Kauri was forced to flee Estonia during the Soviet occupation of Estonia, and he arrived in Sweden in 1944. There he became an assistant and later a lecturer at the Zoological Institution in Lund. He earned a doctorate on amphibians, although his field of work was horse-flies. Bergen Zoological Museum Kauri later relocated to Norway and was employed at the Bergen Zoological Museum in 1963, in a new professorship of zoology, with an emphasis on terrestrial invertebrates. The position included heading the museum, as well as lecturing on classification, faunistics, ecology, and animal geography. The former professorship also covered marine biology. Kauri had a great impact on the zoological institute at the University of Bergen. The number of students increased significantly. Kauri had an enthusiasm and dedication to work that few could match, and he built a viable institute with classification and ecology as it key elements. He retired in 1976 but remained engaged at the museum for several years after that. Hardanger Plateau project The Hardanger Plateau () project took place as part of the International Biological Program (IBP) and started in 1969. It dealt with insects and other lower groups of fauna in the high mountains. Kauri became the project's leader in a group of researchers from the University of Bergen. Three research assistants were hired through 1974. A number of publications resulted in the series Fauna of the Hardangervidda, as well as several major theses. This was of great importance for the knowledge about the fauna in the high mountains. Arachnids Kauri continued his studies in Norway on horse- flies, daddy longlegs (Opiliones), and spiders. He wrote several publications. In 1985 he worked on material from central Africa, which resulted in 61 new species, 12 new genera, and three new sub-families for science. As late as 1998 he produced an overview of spiders on the Hardanger Plateau, edited by Erling Hauge and Torstein Solh√∏y.

Biography  Milton Klein was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1924. He was educated at public schools in University City, Missouri, and entered Washington University in St. Louis, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering in 1944. During World War II he served in the U.S. Navy. Klein began working in the nuclear power field at the Argonne National Laboratory in 1946. He earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School in 1950, and that year joined the Atomic Energy Commission as a chemical engineer at its Chicago Operations Office. He rose to become its Assistant manager for Technical Operations, overseeing the development of nuclear reactors for nuclear power plants. On August 29, 1960, NASA created the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) to oversee the joint NASA-AEC Project Rover, which aimed to develop a nuclear thermal rocket engine. Klein was appointed its deputy manager. Its staff were a combination of NASA and AEC employees whose responsibilities included \\"program and resource planning and evaluation, the justification and distribution of program resources, the definition and control of overall program requirements, monitoring and reporting of progress and problems to NASA and AEC management, and the preparation of testimony to Congress.\\" In 1967, Klein became manager of the SNPO, and director of AEC's Division of Space Nuclear Systems. In 1970, SNPO was renamed the Space Nuclear Systems Office, and enlarged to cover all space nuclear-related activities, which included NERVA and the development of nuclear-powered generators that were used by the Apollo, Pioneer, Viking and Voyager programs. He was also a member of the review board that investigated the Apollo 13 accident. The SNSO was abolished in June 1972. For his services, he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1972. After leaving NASA, Klein joined the Federal Railroad Administration as its associate administrator for research, development and administration. He worked for the Mitre Corporation,as its associate technical director, responsible for directing its energy program, and was the director of Research, Development, and Technology Applications of the International Energy Agency in Paris.

He is best known as the first lifetime exclusive model for Falcon Studios, and for his later work at Colt Studio Group. Biography Chase was raised in Highland Park, Texas. At the age of 30, he was inspired by the 1993 pornographic film On the Mark to enter the adult film industry, and submitted photographs of himself to the film's producers at Falcon Studios. He was cast in his first adult film, 1996's Backwoods, a week after being interviewed by Falcon, and relocated from Boston to San Francisco. At Falcon, Chase would become emblematic of what Claude J. Summers' The Queer Encyclopedia of Film and Television describes as \\"the new wave of gay porn stars in the new millennium: masculine and muscular, sexually versatile, and confidently gay,\\" and would become the studio's first lifetime exclusive model. He would become known for his dominant performances and his exceptionally large endowment, though Chase has described himself as \\"the Wally Cleaver of porn\\" in reference to erotica initially not coming naturally to him. He frequently performed as a top, though his bottoming debut in 1997's California Kings would win him a GayVN Award and a Gay Erotic Video Award. Chase would work frequently with directors John Rutherford and Chi Chi Larue at Falcon, and would appear in the Larue-directed music video for \\"I Am a Pig\\" by 2wo, a side project of Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford. Chase was romantically involved with the adult film actor Joe Cade; they had a commitment ceremony in 1998, but later separated amicably. In 2004, Chase was inducted into the GayVN Hall of Fame, and announced his retirement from the adult entertainment industry in his acceptance speech. He moved to Granbury, Texas and later Dallas before returning to the adult entertainment industry in 2006 as a model for Colt Studios, where he appeared in films with a more hirsute and bear-like appearance. His most recent (and, to date, final) credited adult film is The Big One, a bareback film released in 2009 for the now-defunct gay pornography studio Butch Bear. Chase was interviewed for the 2015 documentary Seed Money: The Chuck Holmes Story, which follows the life of Falcon Studios founder Chuck Holmes.

Born to a Jewish family in Synada, Constantine excelled at Hebrew and the Old Testament from a young age. He was said to have been converted to Christianity as a youth by the power of the sign of the cross, which he had made in spontaneous imitation of a Christian merchant. His full conversion was gradual. It may be linked to the campaign undertaken by the Emperor Basil I () to convert the Jews early in his reign. Constantine's family arranged a marriage for him, but on his wedding day he fled to the monastery of Phlouboute, where he was finally baptised. Constantine, known as \\"the former Jew\\" (œå ŒµŒæ ŒôŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒπœâŒΩ), remained at Phlouboute for twelve years. He was ordained a priest in order to evangelise the Jews of Nicaea. In a vision, Saint Spyridon told him to go to Cyprus, where he acquired a relic of a martyr named Palamon, which he gave to the monastery of Saint Hyakinthos in Nicaea. After Phlouboute, he joined the monastic establishments of Bithynian Olympus, where Jewish relatives tried to have him arrested and sent back as a fugitive. He eventually did settle on Olympus, first at Atroa and later at Balaios. From Olympus he is said to have intervened to reconcile the Emperor Basil I with his son Leo VI, co-emperor since 870. An anonymous hagiography of Constantine (Acta Sanctorum, Nov. IV, 628‚Äì656 and Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca 370) was written by a Nicaean monk early in the tenth century during the reign of Leo VI, probably in Constantinople. The author was not an acquaintance of Constantine and he relied on oral traditions for his composition. It survives in a single manuscript. The author portrays Constantine as popular with the Byzantine aristocracy. The miracles he attributes to Constantine's sanctity are unconventional. In one, a seductress faints when Constantine makes the sign of the cross. Archbishop Anthony of Novgorod records the existence of a church dedicated to Constantine in the Jewish Quarter of Constantinople in the thirteenth century.

Life  Caffi was born the son of Michele and Bianca Boncio on 14 June 1778. Caffi initially studied law (the profession of his family) privately with don Benedetto de Luca. Afterward, Caffi decided to dedicate himself to music, studying counterpoint under Matteo Rauzzini, Simon Mayr, and Giuseppe Scatena, who was an Augustinian friar and pupil of Antonio Lotti. He studied harpsichord under Francesco Gardi. While still young, he began composing cantatas, melodrammi, and a few instrumental pieces. Though the young Venetian never made it his profession to compose, it allowed him to expand his musicological studies and integrate himself in the music culture of his hometown. In 1811, Caffi and other music enthusiasts formed the Philharmonic Institute of Venice. The public school of music included concert halls, headquartering in the Saint Rocco and Margherita monastery. The institution closed in 1816 because of economic issues, however. Still, the enterprise proved to be viable. While a magistrate, Caffi continued to study music history, beginning to draft his Storia generale della musica presso i Veneziani (General History of the Music of the Venetians). The history was initially meant to be divided into five sections. The first three sections would discuss the three musical genres: ecclesiastical, theatrical, and academic. The fourth and fifth sections discussed popular and Venetian music, respectively. His work on the history ceased in 1827, however, when he was transferred to the Milan Court of Appeals. Here, he was able to research and prepare biographies of some musicians from the Venetian school: Andrea Gabrieli, Baldassare Galuppi, Antonio Lotti, Benedetto Marcello, and Gioseffo Zarlino, among others. He first printed these in his Storia della musica sacra (History of Sacred Music).

After graduation, he was hired as a lecturer of science at Ravenshaw College, where he worked until 1881. At the end of 1881, he was offered a state scholarship to study agriculture at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, England. In 1882 he took up life membership of the Royal Agricultural Society, and in 1883 was elected a Fellow of the Chemical Society. He completed his degree at the Royal Agricultural College in 1884. After visits to Scotland, France and Italy, he returned to India. Bangabasi school and college While in England, Bose came to believe in the importance of widespread education. Accordingly, shortly after his return, he turned down offers of employment from various provincial governments, but in 1885 founded Bangabasi School, which was aimed at preparing boys for the university entrance examinations. The institution was expanded in 1887 to add college-level classes (at Bangabasi College). He remained involved in administration of the college until near the end of his life.

The book was intended as a textbook containing plants familiar to Indian students, in contrast to the European textbooks commonly used in India at the time.

History  Diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Egypt were established on 10 June 1947 after the signing of the Treaty of Friendship between the two countries by Minister of Foreign Affairs Haji Agus Salim of Indonesia and Prime Minister Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha of Egypt. Two months later Indonesia opened a diplomatic mission in Cairo with H. M. Rasyidi as Charg√© d'affaires. On 25 February 1950, the mission was elevated to embassy status and Rasyidi became the first Indonesian ambassador to Egypt. He was also appointed non-resident ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Abdurrahman Wahid, the 4th president of Indonesia, was employed at the embassy around 1964, while he was a student at Al-Azhar University. His duties included translating reports into Arabic and English. After the failed 30 September Movement in 1965, he was ordered to prepare reports about his fellow students as he was active in the local Association of Indonesian Students organization. The Indonesian government at that time wanted to root out Indonesian students who could be communist sympathizers.

These vehicles are primarily used to mount Beijing's ballistic missile family and are used in conjunction with other transporter erector launchers, to further bolster China's ballistic missile capabilities. Likewise, its much larger sibling truck, the Hanyang HY4330, is able to carry DF-31 (both DF-31A and DF-31B variants) intercontinental ballistic missiles, and functions in a similar nature to conventional TELs. Description The Hanyang HY4260 is a model 6x6 tractor truck produced and developed by the Hanyang Special Purpose Vehicle Institute. Like other Chinese TELs such as the WS2600, the HY4260 primarily carries the DF-21 intermediate range ballistic missile, which is towed on the back on a semi-trailer. Due to its Deutz BF12L413F turbocharged diesel engine, the HY4260 could tow semi-trailers with a weight ranging from 50-75 tons in weight. It transports these ballistic missiles from their shelters and storage bases to the launch sites. Due to its high mobility, the HY4260 could leave its base of storage and operate in remote areas on high alert, greatly increasing the difficulty in being detected by hostile forces. Although the HY4260 has off-road capabilities, it is primarily designed to operate on hard conventional surface roads.

These trucks behave essentially like conventional transporter erector launchers and as such, are used primarily to offer Beijing second strike nuclear capabilities; bolstering China's ballistic missile capabilities. Likewise, its smaller sibling truck, the Hanyang HY4260, carries the versatile DF-21 intermediate range ballistic missiles, which has an anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities. Description Unlike the HY4260, the Hanyang HY4330 is a much larger 8x8 tractor vehicle. This increased size allows the HY4330 to tow the much larger DF-31A road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile. Due to this, the Hanyang Special Purpose Vehicle Institute developed this truck specifically for this role. It became a successor to an older Hanyang HY4301 which towed the more conventional DF-31 base-ICBM model. The HY4330 became operational in 2007 and is implemented specifically to the Second Artillery Corps of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force. Despite its payload capabilities and operational history, the HY4330 has not been produced in any significant quantities. As the HY4330 and the smaller HY4260 is powered by the Deutz BF12L513C turbocharged diesel engine, the HY4330 could carry a maximum payload of 60 tons whilst maintaining a higher speed with a maximum travel range of 1000km, vastly improving its mobility and complicating detection.

Early life  Josh Beames was born in the coastal city of Warrnambool, Victoria, on Australia's Great Ocean Road. As a teenager, he was a keen surfer and began exploring photography to capture images out on the ocean.  Career  Beames became more interested in photography as a young adult and quickly progressed from experimenting with smartphone and GoPro cameras to professional equipment, after his work received local news coverage and caught the attention of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. Several of Beames' works have received media coverage for capturing natural phenomena, including aurora australis, lightning storms, and bioluminescent sea life, which has won recognition from the Bureau of Meteorology several times. Beames is self- taught and has said his camera techniques are the result of \\"trial and error\\", while he is creatively motivated by capturing the experience of exploration and a sense of adventure: Beames also works as a freelancer on events, real estate, and commercial tourism projects, amassing a client list that includes Qantas, Jetstar, Tourism Australia, and Tourism Tasmania. He lists American photographer Chris Burkard amongst his creative influences. = Partnership with Nikon Australia = In 2018, Beames began working full-time as a photographer and soon later secured an official partnership with Nikon Australia, supporting his efforts to travel and photograph Australian and international landscapes, including The Twelve Apostles, Uluru, The Grampians, and Milford Sound. In 2019, Beames joined the Nikon School as a photography lecturer and conducts workshops in Melbourne and regional Victoria.

He was fired from the German service and called a \\"double-dyed rascal.\\" Confusion with Robert Graves Renown British war poet Robert von Ranke Graves was initially received with intense suspicion when a rumour was started that he was a spy. Jean Moorcroft Wilson, a British academic and writer, best known as a biographer and critic of First World War poets and poetry, stated that \\"it was unlucky that a notorious German spy caught in England in 1911\\" had used the name Armgaard Karl Graves, an alias with the same last name as the poet. Life Graves left the German Empire in 1898. Twice he was charged with theft in New South Wales, and in December 1910 he was charged with molesting a woman in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Around 1911 he returned to Germany under the title \\"A.K. Graves Dr med.\\" A few months later he was sentenced to six months in prison for fraud in Wiesbaden but fled to Szczecin, where he was arrested. During the Agadir crisis, Graves was probably recruited directly from the prison for naval intelligence at his Berlin headquarters in the presence of Arthur Tapken, Georg Stammer and Gustav Steinhauer. As' W. Lewis, he was to observe movements of British warships off Scotland, especially in front of the naval bases Rosyth and Cromarty, for which he received ¬£15 (¬£ in ) a month. In early 1912, he reached Edinburgh and went to Glasgow soon afterwards. By post surveillance of other suspects, he was discovered and under surveillance. His return to Berlin forced the Scottish police to arrest him on April 14, 1912; Three months later, he was sentenced to 8 months in prison. On December 18, he was secretly freed on the grounds of poor health, since he had agreed to work with the British Secret Service (MI5) for ¬£2 (¬£ in ) a month. Graves travelled to Berlin to get a list of spies in Britain for MI5 from Admiralty Chief Secretary Stammer. However, instead of returning to the UK he was sent to the United States by German command. In February and March 1913 he demanded money from MI5 to return from there to the UK, which they did not provide. Instead, Graves presented himself as a \\"spymaster\\" in the US press and shared information about his two employers. On the eve of the war, his autobiography, The Secrets of the German War Office was published and sold 100,000 copies. In 1915, a sequel of his first book was published, The Secrets of the Hohenzollerns, and wrote for various newspaper columns on his predictions about WWI. In November 1916, he tried to extort $3,000 ($ in ) by blackmailing the wife of Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, the German ambassador to Washington, with some letters \\"alleged to contain matters showing her infirmities and failings.\\" His ghostwriter Edward Lyell Fox had acted as a courier. Bernstorff, however, considered the material worthless and got the US State Department involved and Graves was arrested. The German Reich rejected the testimony of the embassy employee Graf Hatzfeldt-Trachenberg in the process and he was released again. Graves was arrested in 1917 for being in a restricted zone for foreigners in Kansas City and interned until the end of the war in November 1918. He remained in the USA after the war. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison in 1934 for stealing $1,500 ($ in ). After his release in 1937, he was to be deported, but claimed that Hitler's Germany would certainly kill him, so \\"a government agency\\" reportedly intervened and took him off the Germany-bound ship. Graves probably died in the USA.

Background The group was formed in 2012 in Manbij and operated in Aleppo's countryside between Manbij and Jarabulus. The group fought against the Syrian government and later came into conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group also took part in the Battle of Aleppo, and was allied with the rebel Army of Mujahideen. History On 22 July 2013, the commander of Liwa Jund al-Haramain's 19th Brigade was killed in Khan al-Assal, while fighting pro-government forces in the city. On 17 November 2013, Liwa Jund al-Haramain clashed with ISIL, Liwa Ahrar Souriya and Daraa al-Jazeera, as well as another faction believed to be associated with ISIL after days of tensions in Manbij, between Liwa Jund al- Haramain and other factions in the city. The group's headquarters were stormed by ISIL and allied opposition groups, and a drive-by type shooting also occurred at their headquarters. The clashes came after Jund al-Haramain reportedly overran the headquarters of other factions in the city, and killed the mother and son of an ISIL fighter by shooting at the car they were in. On 3 January 2014, after the formation of the Army of Mujahideen rebel alliance, Liwa Jund al-Haramain joined the alliance, alongside the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement and Ansar al-Khilafah, a Hizb ut-Tahrir aligned group. On the same day the Army of Mujahideen declared war on ISIL with the Syrian Revolutionaries Front. In March 2016, the group joined the Syrian Democratic Forces. In August 2017, Ibrahim al-Banawi the commander of Liwa Jund al- Haramain defected to the Syrian Army after meeting with Suheil al-Hassan of the Syrian Army's Tiger Forces.

No studies have proven any of these claims, nor has the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the recipe. The juice, composed of a mixture of water, salt, and fermented cabbage or kale, is falsely claimed to expunge Candida. Evidence has shown that this treatment is not only ineffective, but can also cause serious harm or even death due to its high sodium content. Jilly Juice was conceived by Jillian Mai Thi Epperly, who has no medical or scientific background. She has garnered media scrutiny for her controversial claims that Jilly Juice can help treat medical conditions, and petitions and other efforts have been made to ban the product and its promotion from social media. Advocates of Jilly Juice have been dubbed a \\"poop cult\\", and by 2017, had formed a now-defunct Facebook group made up of over 58,000 members. In 2018, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned Epperly that it is against the law to advertise a product's health benefits without proper scientific support. Overview Proponents of Jilly Juice have falsely claimed that the drink is able to rid the body of Candida, which they have said is responsible for an assortment of conditions Jilly Juice is a concoction of water, salt, and fermented cabbage or kale. According to its proponents, the recipe for Jilly Juice includes two cups of water, a tablespoon of Himalayan pink salt, and two cups of cabbage or kale. The recipe calls for the ingredients to then be pur√©ed in a blender, poured into a glass jar, covered, and left to ferment at room temperature for three days. Jillian Mai Thi Epperly, the creator of Jilly Juice, has claimed that salt is a \\"positive element\\" for the immune system, and that cabbage contains important probiotics and nutrients. She has recommended that individuals start consuming two cups of Jilly Juice per day, and increasing their consumption of it to up to 16 cups a day or a gallon a day. Proponents of Jilly Juice have claimed that a variety of illnesses and conditions are the result of Candida, a yeast which they claim attracts parasites in one's body. According to Epperly, an abundance of Candida in the body can cause harmful bacteria to multiply, create holes in the intestine, and allow toxins from food to enter one's bloodstream‚Äîshe refers to this process as \\"leaky gut syndrome\\", which is a hypothetical and medically unrecognized condition. Epperly recommends a restricted diet supplemented by consuming large quantities of Jilly Juice, which supposedly removes Candida and parasites from one's body by inducing diarrhea (these bouts of diarrhea have been referred to by Jilly Juice advocates as \\"waterfalls\\"). Along with supposedly expunging Candida and parasites from one's body, Jilly Juice has been claimed to be able to cure autism, cancer, and psoriasis, as well as regenerate missing limbs, impede or reverse the effects of aging, and \\"cure\\" homosexuality. Efficacy Drinking Jilly Juice is ineffective in treating ailments, and can cause serious harm‚Äîincluding extreme dehydration and salt poisoning‚Äîor death due to its high sodium content. Joseph A. Schwarcz, director of McGill University's Office for Science and Society, has noted that the drink's dangerously high salt concentration can lead to hypertension. Poor fermentation of the drink could also lead to ill effects. David Seres, director of medical nutrition at Columbia University Medical Center, has called the claims of Jilly Juice proponents \\"absolutely dangerous nonsense\\". In 2018, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned Epperly about claims made regarding Jilly Juice in a letter that stated: \\"It is against the law to make health claims, whether directly or indirectly, through advertising or other means, without adequate scientific support at the time the claims are made, or to exaggerate the benefits of products or services you are promoting\\". History =Origins= Jillian Mai Thi Epperly, the creator of Jilly Juice, was born in Vietnam. She moved to the United States in May 1975 before the age of two, and was adopted by American parents. Her father worked in biotechnology, which she claims helped her to realize that the pharmaceutical industry is working with doctors to keep consumers addicted to medication. She met her husband online, then moved to Ohio to live with him. She developed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and after being exposed to pseudoscientific viewpoints and conspiracy theories such as the anti-vaccination movement and chemtrails, she sought alternative methods to treat her PMDD. In her online research of various diseases, Epperly found that Candida or other fungi were \\"always a factor\\", and concluded that Candida was responsible for such diseases. Epperly began brewing and fermenting recipes for kombucha and pickles before deciding to brew fermented cabbage, with a significant salt content. The result, a concoction of water, salt, and fermented cabbage or kale which Epperly claims can treat a number of illnesses and conditions, was dubbed \\"Jilly Juice\\". =Spread= Epperly began making Jilly Juice with cabbage and kale in October 2016, and by January 2017, she was posting videos related to the drink on her personal Facebook page. The videos garnered a following, leading to the creation of a Facebook group known as \\"Exposing the Lies Candida: Weaponized Fungus Mainstreaming Mutancy\\". Over the next few months, the group grew to include thousands of members. In the Facebook group, members would often post images of their bowel movements, comments about supposed parasites visible in said bowel movements, and videos of themselves drinking Jilly Juice, preparing Jilly Juice as an enema, or giving Jilly Juice to young children and infants. In February 2017, after receiving backlash from groups opposed to the promotion and consumption of Jilly Juice, Epperly launched a website, Jillyjuice.com, and removed the Facebook group from public view. At its peak, the Facebook group had amassed over 58,000 members. Content on Jillyjuice.com, which includes private forums, can be accessed by paying $30 annually or $5 monthly. Epperly has also provided private phone consultations for $70 an hour. In May 2018, Epperly appeared on the American talk show Dr. Phil. The show's host, Phil McGraw, called Epperly's claims regarding Jilly Juice \\"outrageous\\". =Death of Bruce Wilmot= In the summer of 2017, Bruce Wilmot, who was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer, began taking Jilly Juice. Wilmot's daughter Taylor described him as \\"emaciated\\", and stated that he \\"was drinking so much of it, he was basically starving himself. It was all coming out as diarrhea.\\" On July 20, 2017, about a month after he began drinking Jilly Juice, Bruce Wilmot died. Epperly responded to his death in a video by saying that Wilmot did not consume enough Jilly Juice, stating that he \\"really should have kept going\\", and that his medications, his consumption of pineapple juice, or the medical industry may have contributed to his death. Epperly later wrote that she \\"can't be held accountable\\" for deaths resulting from the consumption of Jilly Juice, and that \\"correlation does not mean causation.\\" Backlash After Epperly's Facebook group grew in popularity, several other Facebook groups were created which opposed her and her followers' claims regarding Jilly Juice. A movement of Jilly Juice opponents, which has been described as \\"anti-juice\\", \\"anti-Jillian\\", and \\"anti-Epperly\\", has itself accrued thousands of adherents. Petitions on Change.org calling for Epperly and Jilly Juice to be banned from social media have also been created, and anti-Epperly advocates have reported her false health claims to the Food and Drug Administration, the FTC, the State Medical Board of Ohio, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office.

The WS21200 along with the WS51200, is one of the larger TELs developed by the Wanshan Special Vehicle. The size of the WS21200 allows it to carry ICBMs, however, the technological limitations of Pakistan has forced the WS21200 to mount medium-range ballistic missiles such as the Shaheen-III. Description The Wanshan WS21200 is a Chinese/Pakistani 16x16 road-mobile TEL with a payload capacity of 80 tons thanks to the Cummins KTTA19-C700 turbocharged diesel engine. The 700 horsepower engine allows the WS21200 to drive at respectable speeds with a maximum range of 1000 km.

The station aired from April 3, 1958, to January 20, 1965. History KADY signed on at 1 p.m. on April 3, 1958. The station broadcast with 5,000 watts during the day from a tower along State Highway 94 in Boschertown. Within three months of signing on, William R. Cady, Jr., an advertising executive, bought out majority shareholder Harman Moseley. The remaining shares were owned by Jack Chenoweth, the chief engineer at KETC television, and the Schnatmeier family. KADY quickly expanded to FM. In May 1959, it filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to build a new FM radio station in St. Louis. KADI 96.5 hit the air on December 22, duplicating KADY's programming and broadcasting after sunset; in 1964, it duplicated 63 percent of the AM outlet's programming. The combination of KADY and KADI promoted itself as \\"The KADY Twins\\" and used a cicada-themed logo. While the stations' programming consisted mostly of fine music, KADY-KADI snared the rights to broadcast Missouri Tigers football games in 1961. In November 1962, the sale of KADY-KADI to KADY, Inc., headed by former Filmways president Rodney Erickson, was announced. Little changed in operations until February 14, 1964, when the station left the air at 11:30 a.m. as eight employees walked out in a pay dispute. The employees, including four engineers, claimed they had not been paid in two weeks and paychecks were being issued late. KADY-KADI, however, returned to the air on February 24, after 10 days of silence. By that summer, KADY-KADI had become affiliated with the Mutual Broadcasting System. Yet again, it was unpaid engineers who started the second‚Äîand final‚Äîstrike in KADY history. The station did not sign on as usual on January 21, 1965; the local representative of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said that three IBEW engineers had not been paid for a month, and acting manager Homer Griffith shut the station down at the orders of ownership in New York. The next day, Griffith announced that KADY would remain off the air pending a \\"financial reorganization\\". KADI was sold in August 1965 to Vanguard Broadcasting Corporation, which would return it to the air. In November 1965, Michael Rice of Webster Groves filed an application to build a new radio station on the 1460 frequency in St. Charles. KADY still faced legal troubles: the FCC fined the station in February 1966 for failure to illuminate its tower‚Äîthe first such fine the commission had ever issued‚Äîover the objections of the licensee, which claimed it was insolvent. The AM outlet was never sold; the FCC granted the Rice application in November 1967 and KIRL began operating from the former KADY site at Boschertown in the summer of 1968.

His work frequently included geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles, leading to his reputation as a pioneer of scientifically oriented design.  Biography  Onosato was born on June 8, 1912 in Iida, Nagano. His family moved to Kiryu, Gunma when he was a child. He studied Western-style painting under . In 1935 he had his first exhibition, which was with the Nika Association. The same year he formed a group called \\"Kokusho\\" with three other artists who studied under Tsuda. In 1937, he helped to found the Free Artists Association (Jiyu Bijutsuka Kyokai). During World War II, Onosato conscripted to the Japanese Army and was sent to Manchuria. He was captured and interned in Siberia for three years. He returned to Japan in 1948. He married Tomoko Onosato in 1951. While he started out as an oil painter, Onosato later branched out to printmaking in the 1950s. He made both silk screen prints and lithographs. He decided to quit the Free Artists Association in 1956, and worked as an independent artist from that point on. In 1963, one of his works was exhibited at the 7th International Japanese Exhibition, and he took first place. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1964. In 1964 and 1966 Onosato was one of the artists that represented Japan at the Venice Biennale. Onosato died of pneumonia on November 30, 1986.

Specifically, it refers to the idea that explicitly labeling one's, typically negative, emotional state results in a reduction of the conscious experience, physiological response, and/or behavior resulting from that emotional state. For example, writing about a negative experience in one's journal may improve one's mood. Some other examples of affect labeling include discussing one's feelings with a therapist, complaining to friends about a negative experience, posting one's feelings on social media or acknowledging the scary aspects of a situation. Affect labeling is an extension of the simple concept that talking about one's feelings can make oneself feel better. Although this idea has been used in talk therapy for over a century, formal research into affect labeling has only begun in recent years. Already, researchers have quantified some of the emotion-regulatory effects of affect labeling, such as decreases in subjective emotional affect, reduced activity in the amygdala, and a lower skin conductance response to frightening stimuli. As a consequence of being a relatively new technique in the area of emotion regulation, affect labeling tends to be compared to, and is often confused with, emotional reappraisal, another emotion-regulatory technique. A key difference between the two is that while reappraisal intuitively feels like a strategy to control one's emotions, affect labeling often does not. Even when someone does not intend to regulate their emotions, the act of labeling one's emotions still has positive effects. Affect labeling is still in the early stages of research and thus, there is much about it that remains unknown. While there are several theories for the mechanism by which affect labeling acts, more research is needed to provide empirical support for these hypotheses. Additionally, some work has been done on the applications of affect labeling to real-world issues, such as research that suggests affect labeling may be commonplace on social media sites. Affect labeling also sees some use in clinical settings as a tentative treatment for fear and anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, research on affect labeling has largely focused on laboratory studies, and further research is needed to understand its effects in the real world.  History  The notion that talking about or writing down one's feelings can be beneficial is not a recent one. People have kept diaries for centuries, and the use of talk therapy dates back to the beginnings of psychotherapy. Over the past few decades, the idea that putting one's feelings into words can be beneficial has been shown experimentally. More recently, the concept of affect labeling has grown out of this literature, honing in on the emotion regulation aspect of the benefits of vocalizing feelings. In recent years, research on affect labeling has mostly focused on proving its applicability as an emotion regulation strategy. Although some research exists on the behavioral and neural mechanisms behind its effectiveness, this area of study is still in its early, speculative stages.  Regulatory effects  = Emotional experience = When engaging in affect labeling, subjects subjectively report lower levels of emotional affect than they do in identical conditions without the affect labeling. This effect is not only found when subjects rate their own emotional state, but also when they label the emotion displayed or evoked by stimuli such as images. = Autonomic response = Autonomic responses characteristic of various emotions may decrease after performing affect labeling. For instance, upon quantifying their level of anger on a rating scale, subjects subsequently experienced decreases in heart rate and cardiac output. Research also indicates that giving labels to aversive stimuli results in a lower skin conductance response when similar aversive stimuli are presented in the future, implying affect labeling can have long-term effects on autonomic responses.  Neuroscientific basis  Research has found that engaging in affect labeling results in higher brain activity within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and reduced activity in the amygdala when compared to other tasks involving emotional stimuli. In addition, evidence from brain lesion studies also point to the vlPFC's involvement in the affect labeling process. Subjects with lesions to the right vlPFC were less able to identify the emotional state of a character throughout a film. This implies that the region is required in order for affect-labeling to take place. Additionally, it has been shown through meta- analysis that while the amygdala is found to be active in tasks involving emotional stimuli, activity is lower when subjects had to identify the emotions rather than simply passively viewing the stimuli. One theory that integrates these findings proposes that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex works to down-regulate activity in the amygdala during affect labeling. This theory is supported by evidence from several studies that found negative connectivity between the two brain regions during an affect-labeling task. Furthermore, researchers have used dynamic causal modeling to show specifically that increased activity in the vlPFC is the cause of lower amygdala activity.  Comparison to emotional reappraisal  Emotional reappraisal is an emotion regulation technique where an emotional stimulus is reinterpreted in a new, usually less negative, fashion in order to reduce its effect. As an example, someone might reinterpret a bad test score as being a learning experience, rather than dwelling on the negative aspects of the situation. As it is a related emotion regulation strategy, affect labeling research often draws insight from the existing literature on reappraisal. The most salient difference between affect labeling and reappraisal lies in people's perception of the efficacy of affect labeling. Unlike reappraisal, affect labeling's effectiveness in regulating emotion is fairly unintuitive. Research has shown that while subjects expect reappraisal to reduce emotional distress, they predict the opposite for affect labeling, expecting the vocalization of feelings to actually increase their emotional distress. In reality, while the magnitude of the reduction in emotional response is found to be stronger for reappraisal than for affect labeling, both strategies produce a noticeable decrease. Individuals who respond more to reappraisal after the presentation of emotional stimuli tend to also benefit more from affect labeling, indicating they may act through the same mechanism. Reappraisal and affect labeling share similarities in their neural signatures. As in affect labeling, reappraisal produces activity in the vlPFC while inhibiting response in the amygdala. However, in contrast to affect labeling, reappraisal has also been found to generate activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  Possible mechanisms  = Distraction = One possible explanation for affect labeling's effectiveness is that it is simply preventing the labeler from fully experiencing the emotional response by drawing their attention away. Distraction techniques have been shown to elicit similar neural activity as affect labeling, with increased activity in the vlPFC and decreased in the amygdala. Additionally, some explicit distraction paradigms have been shown to result in similar reductions of negative emotions. However, evidence is mixed on this front, as other tasks that involve turning attention away, such as a gender labeling task, do not produce the same reduction. Applications of affect labeling seem to suggest that the mechanism of action is not simply distraction. When applied with exposure therapy, affect labeling was found to be much more effective in reducing skin conductance response than distraction. Affect labeling is also known to result in long-term benefits in clinical settings, whereas distraction is generally considered to negatively affect progress. = Self-reflection = Another proposed mechanism for affect labeling is through self-reflection. Emotional introspection differs from affect labeling in that it does not require explicit labeling of emotion; however, engaging in introspection has similar effects to affect labeling. As such, rather than being the entire process, affect labeling could act as a first-step in an emotional introspective process. Evidence supporting this mechanism uses a measure of dispositional mindfulness to quantify people's ability to self-reflect. Researchers were able to link dispositional mindfulness to affect labeling by showing that people with higher levels of dispositional mindfulness showed stronger brain activation in regions associated with affect labeling, such as the vlPFC. Additionally, they showed greater reductions in activity in the amygdala, suggesting that mindfulness modulates the effectiveness of affect labeling, and lending support to the idea that introspection is the mechanism of action. Unfortunately, this theory of affect labeling struggles to explain affect labeling's benefits on stimuli that do not apply to the self. For instance, the regulatory effects of labeling external stimuli, such as faces or aversive images presented during an experiment, are unlikely to be explained by a self-reflective process. = Reduction of uncertainty = People are known to be ambiguity averse, and the complexity of emotion can often create uncertainty in feelings that is unpleasant. Some researchers believe that affect labeling acts by reducing uncertainty in emotion. This is supported by neural evidence connecting uncertainty to activity in the amygdala. Affect labeling has been shown to down-regulate activity in the amygdala, and this may be a result of the reduction of uncertainty of feelings. Evidence against this theory is the fact that while some emotions are characteristically uncertain, such as fear or anxiety, others tend to be more straightforward, e.g. sadness and anger. Since affect labeling is known to work across all these types of emotions, it is unlikely that uncertainty reduction is the only mechanism by which it acts. = Symbolic conversion = Another theory of affect labeling posits that the act of labeling is a sort of symbolic encoding of information, changing the stimulus into language. It has been proposed that this symbolic conversion may act as a type of psychological distancing from the stimulus, leading to overall lower levels of affect. While affect labeling specifically refers to giving labels to emotions, assigning abstract content labels, such as identifying objects as \\"human\\", \\"landscape\\", etc., has been found to yield many of the same benefits. There is neural evidence to support this as well. Several studies have found that when subjects classify stimuli based on non- emotional categories, they exhibit greater vlPFC activity and less activity in the amygdala, just like in affect labeling. The fact that labeling non- emotional stimuli has similar effects to that of emotional stimuli suggests that the simple act of converting a stimulus into language may be driving the effect.  Applications  = Social media = The act of posting about one's feelings on social media sites such as Twitter is a type of affect labeling. One research study analyzed 74,487 Twitter users' tweets for emotional contact, classifying tweets as either before or after instances of affect labeling, which were identified as tweets stating \\"I feel...\\". The researchers found that emotions tended to increase in valence over time in tweets preceding the affect labeling tweet, with the greatest positive or negative emotion being experienced closest to the act of labeling. After the affect labeling tweet, the emotional intensity of the following tweets was found to fall off quickly, going back to baseline levels of valence. The results of this study support the application of affect labeling as an emotion regulation strategy in real-world settings, and show that social media users engage, potentially unknowingly, in affect labeling all the time. = Mental health = A small body of work has begun to look at affect labeling's potential as a clinical treatment in conjunction with exposure therapy for phobias, anxiety disorders, and other stress disorders. One study found that subjects with high public speaking anxiety who chose from a set of predetermined emotion words to describe their feelings before giving a speech in front of an audience showed greater reductions in anxiety, quantified by physiological responses such as heart rate, than subjects who performed a control, shape-matching, task before giving their speeches. These results suggest that combining affect labeling with an exposure treatment is more effective than exposure alone. Notably, the affect labeling and control conditions found no difference in self-reported anxiety; however, physiological responses characteristic of anxiety were reduced for the subjects who performed the affect labeling. Another study found similar results in spider-fearful individuals, exposing them to a tarantula over two days while simultaneously verbalizing their feelings. Compared to subjects in reappraisal, distraction, and control conditions, subjects who engaged in affect labeling showed lower skin conductance response than the other conditions, although there was no difference between conditions in self-reported fear. Although there is tentative evidence for the value of affect labeling in clinical settings, researchers acknowledge that there is still a need for many more studies drawing from clinical populations in order to deduce the value of using affect labeling in conjunction with other treatments before it can be safely adopted into practice.  Limitations and concerns  The use of self-report measures of emotion in psychological research may invoke affect labeling, even in studies unrelated to the topic. Whether or not this poses a problem for emotion researchers is still largely unknown. Although affect labeling appears be effective in laboratory studies with many participants, as with all psychological phenomena, individuals will vary in their experience. The reasons for individual differences in the effectiveness of affect labeling are in need of further research. Furthermore, paradigms used to study affect labeling differ widely, with some providing subjects with pre-prepared labels to select, while others require subjects to self-generate their own labels. These paradigms produce noticeable differences in results, with self-generative paradigms finding more long-term delayed effects of regulation, and pre-prepared paradigms finding immediate effects. The explanation for the differences in these results is still relatively unexplored, though some suspect it may be due to pre-prepared labels implying a kind of interpersonal emotion regulation, since it may be interpreted as a kind of support from the experimenter. Whether or not the laboratory findings about affect labeling are applicable to affect labeling in the real world is another question researchers must ask. The situations in which people use affect labeling in real life are rich with context, and it is difficult to say whether the particular operationalizations of affect labeling used in a study allow the results to generalize.

BMSs can be described by three energy gaps, the spin-Ô¨Çip gap Œî2 in valence band (VB), band gap Œî1 and spin-flip gap Œî3 in conduction band (CB). Up to now, bipolar magnetic semiconductors, together with half-metal and spin gapless semiconductor, have been viewed as three important classes of spintronic materials. Manipulation of carrier's spin orientation in bipolar magnetic semiconductors by electrical gating.  Properties and potential applications  The proposal of bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) is aimed to realize electrical control of carriers' spin orientation, which is a key scientific problem in developing high performance spintronics devices, since electric Ô¨Åeld can be easily applied locally, in contrast to magnetic Ô¨Åeld. In BMS, the carriers' spin orientation can be controlled simply by altering the sign of the applied gate voltage. Under zero gate voltage (VG = 0), BMS is semiconducting. Under negative gate voltages (VG < 0) which shift down the material's Fermi level (EF) into spin-flip gap Œî2 in valence band, BMS conducts with carriers fully spin up polarized, while the conducting carriers change to be fully spin down polarized when positive gate voltages (VG > 0) push the Fermi level (EF) up into spin-flip gap Œî3 in conduction band. BMS is expected to be applied as bipolar field eÔ¨Äect spin filter and field eÔ¨Äect spin valve, or entangled electron detectors and separators.  Materials developments  A number of BMS materials have been theoretically predicted, such as MnPSe3 nanosheets, Heusler alloys FeVXSi (X = Ti, Zr), double perovskites A2CrOsO6 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba) and DPP-based metal‚Äìorganic framework.

The limited body of work attributed to him ranges from fruit still lifes, hunting still lifes, vanitas still lifes and trompe l'oeil paintings.Godfriedt van Bochoutt at the Netherlands Institute for Art History  Life  Very little is known about van Bochoutt's life and career. It is believed that he was born in Bruges where he was active between 1659 and 1666. He may also have worked in Rotterdam in the Dutch Republic. Still life with dead birds  Work  Godfriedt van Bochoutt was a specialist still life painter. His known oeuvre is very limited. His subject matter ranges from fruit still lifes; hunting still lifes, vanitas still lifes and trompe l'oeil paintings. Irrespective of their obvious subject matter, most of van Bochoutt's known still-life paintings carry a vanitas meaning. In other words, the objects in the still lifes can be regarded as references to the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits, the dependence on chance of life and its apparent meaninglessness. This meaning is conveyed in these still lifes through the use of stock symbols, which symbolise the transience of life and, in particular, the futility of earthly wealth and distinctions: skulls, extinguished candles, empty glasses, wilting flowers, dead animals, smoking utensils, watches, mirrors, books, dice, playing cards, hourglasses and musical instruments, musical scores, various expensive or exclusive objects such as jewellery and rare shells. The term vanitas is the key term used in the famous line in the Vulgate translation of the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible. In the King James Version this line is translated as . Still life of chestnuts, smoking utensils and a glass of wine on a table These vanitas paintings were informed by a Christian understanding of the world as a temporary place of ephemeral pleasures and torments from which humanity‚Äôs only hope of escape had been offered by the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ. While most of these symbols reference earthly accomplishments (books, scientific instruments, etc.), pleasures (a pipe), sorrows (symbolised by a peeled lemon), the transience of life and death (skulls, soap bubbles, empty shells) and the role of chance in life (dice and playing cards), some symbols used in these paintings carry a dual meaning: a rose or an oar of grain refers as much to the brevity of life as it is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ and thus eternal life. Trompe l'oeil with letters Van Bochoutt's Vanitas still life with a poem on the death of Charles I (signed and dated 1668, at Bonhams auction of 23 October 2019, London lot 67TP) is one of his most extensive and explicit vanitas paintings. The usual moral lessons of vanitas still lifes are conveyed by the objects represented in this still life: the brevity of life and the unstoppable march of time are symbolized by the skull, extinguished candle, empty pipe, smoldering fuse, wilting flowers, decaying fruit, dead animals, an almanac and a watch; the role of chance in life by the dice and playing cards; the hardships of life in the peeled lemon and the emptiness of worldly achievements and power in the ink stand, globe, musical scores and books. The latter theme is particularly highlighted by a reference to the fate of the executed English king Charles I of England. The composition depicts a playing card of a king lying on its side, a crown and a Dutch-language mourning poem on the death of Charles I which is lying over a skull. The poem is stated at its bottom to have been printed in Amsterdam in 1665. In the Northern Netherlands there was a lot of sympathy for the executed king among the large community of exiled English Royalists and a significant number of Dutch citizens. Other Dutch and Flemish still life artists, such as Vincent van der Vinne, Hendrick Andriessen and Carstian Luyckx, were also producing vanitas still lifes on the death of King Charles I for the Dutch market. An example is the Vanitas still life with a globe, sceptre, a skull crowned with straw by Hendrick Andriessen (c. 1650, Mount Holyoke College Art Museum).Hendrick Andriessen, Vanitas Still Life, ca. 1650 at the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum In other works of van Bochoutt the vanitas theme is also present. For instance, the Trompe l'oeil with letters (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) depicts all kinds of mundane objects such as a comb, scissors, papers, letters and pencil stuck to a wall and a candle and books resting on a window sill. These objects take on a vanitas meaning by the presence of a skull that is peaking out from behind the window that is ajar.Attributed to Godfriedt van Bochoutt Trompe l'oeil with letters, 1660-1669, Brussels, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium at the Netherlands Institute for Art History References  External links  * Category:People from Bruges Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Flemish painters ","title":"Godfriedt van Bochoutt"},{"id":"62319828","text":"Borislav Dimitrov (Bulgarian: –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤ –î–∏–º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–≤; born 29 September 1979) is a Bulgarian former professional footballer who played as a forward.

Judy, Ph.D. (born April 16, 1938) is an American author, clinical researcher, clinical trial consultant, and retired professor of physiology and biophysics. He was first introduced to the field of Coenzyme Q10 clinical research by Dr. Karl Folkers, the American bio-chemist who determined the structure of the Coenzyme Q10 molecule. Judy has managed randomized controlled trials into the safety and efficacy of Coenzyme Q10 supplementation for heart failure patients, chronic fatigue syndrome patients, Parkinson's disease patients, and prostate cancer patients. He has been instrumental in the treating of children with Prader-Willi syndrome with Coenzyme Q10. He has also done extensive study of the absorption and bio-availability of various formulations of Coenzyme Q10 supplements. In 1995, Judy founded the SIBR Research Institute, of which he is the president. The SIBR Research Institute helps develop clinical trial protocols to test the safety and efficacy of natural products. It is a full-service clinical research institute. Judy is the author of numerous scholarly journal articles, college textbooks, and the book The Substance That Powers Life: Coenzyme Q10, An Insider‚Äôs Guide.  Education and early career  Judy did his undergraduate studies in Anatomy and Physiology at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, KY. He then did graduate study in bio-physics and physiology at the University of Kentucky from which he graduated with the successful defense of his MS degree thesis in 1963. The title of his thesis was Calorigenic Response of Warm and Cold- Adapted Rabbits to Intravenous Infusion of Epinephrine and Norepinephrine. He earned his Ph.D. at the West Virginia Medical School, Morgantown, West Virginia (1971) after defending his dissertation Sympathetic Nervous System Control of Renal Hemodynamics. For a number of years, from 1963 to 1968, Judy worked in the field of bio-physics at the Manned Space Craft Center in Houston, Texas, and at Cape Canaveral in Florida. He conducted in-flight medical experiments on the Gemini and Apollo missions. He was the first to put an artificial gravitational force on the venous circulation in the prevention of orthostatic hypotension. He also monitored contracts with universities and space program industry corporations that were doing contract work for NASA.  Research into Coenzyme Q10 clinical applications  In 1968, Judy met Dr. Karl Folkers, the chemist who had determined the structure of the Coenzyme Q10 molecule in 1958 while Dr. Folkers was working at the Merck Research Laboratories in New Jersey. By 1968, Dr. Folkers had established the Institute for Bio-Medical Research at the University of Texas in Austin. The purpose of the new institute was to increase the understanding of the importance of the substance Coenzyme Q10 to human health. Dr. Folkers encouraged Judy to do, first, preclinical studies of Coenzyme Q10 absorption and bio-availability using live dogs, which were not put to sleep during the experiments and were not sacrificed after the experiments. In the 1980s, Judy began to administer clinical studies of the safety and health effects of Coenzyme Q10 supplementation in humans. = Heart failure patients = In 1984, Judy published clinical trial results showing that 28 of 34 patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV) had responded well to Coenzyme Q10 treatment with improved cardiac hemodynamics and kinetics. In 1985, Judy conducted a successful five-year study in Class IV congestive heart failure patients. In 1986, Judy published the first report of the long-term management of end stage heart failure with Coenzyme Q10. This study has developed into a 30-year study of the management of congestive heart failure with the ubiquinone form of Coenzyme Q10. It has shown that heart failure patients who received Coenzyme Q10 supplementation together with their conventional medications have a significantly better survival than patients who receive placebo supplementation together with their conventional medications. Moreover, in 1986, Judy published the results of a double- blind, crossover study of the effect of Coenzyme Q10 on patients with cardiac disease. The study data showed that improvement in cardiac pumping and contractibility came, typically, within 30 to 60 days of daily supplementation with 100 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10. Peak response came, generally, with 90 days of supplementation. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation did not improve heart function quickly but did result in significantly increased long-term improvement. Furthermore, if the Coenzyme Q10 treatment was discontinued, then the patients‚Äô heart function gradually decreased. In 1991, Judy reported the subsequent findings from the long-term management of heart failure patients with adjunctive Coenzyme Q10 treatment. He reported that Coenzyme Q10 is a safe and naturally occurring mediator of the process of cellular bio- energetics well-suited for long-term use. Coenzyme Q10 is not a fast-acting substance in heart failure. If the patient's condition is so severe that he or she does not have 40 ‚Äì 60 to respond, then the CoQ10 treatment is likely to be ineffective. Once the patient responds to the Coenzyme Q10 treatment, however, and his or her heart function begins to improve, then the clinical course becomes more stable and the patient's condition is easier to manage. Improvement of one or two NYHA functional classes is likely. Coenzyme Q10 adjunctive treatment of heart failure patients is a long-term therapy because patients whose Coenzyme Q10 treatment is discontinued will suffer a clinical relapse. Clinical relapse after discontinuation of long-term Coenzyme Q10 therapy did not follow the same course as clinical relapse after discontinuation of short-term Coenzyme Q10 therapy. The relapse after the withdrawal of short-term Coenzyme Q10 therapy tended to be a rapid relapse followed by deterioration of heart function; the relapse after the withdrawal of long-term Coenzyme Q10 therapy was delayed and reduced by comparison. In summary, long-term management of severe heart failure patients with 100 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10 per day in conjunction with conventional therapy showed that 70% responded to the Coenzyme Q10 treatment albeit fairly slowly. Peak improvements came, typically, within 8‚Äì12 months. Survival (1‚Äì8 years) in the Coenzyme Q10 group was greater than in a matched control group (n=90) treated with conventional drugs only. The results of this early study showed that long-term Coenzyme Q10 therapy is safe, is effective in chronic heart failure patients with measurable CoQ10 deficiency, and is associated with improved long-term survival compared to conventionally treated patients. Judy's clinical studies of Coenzyme Q10 supplementation of heart failure patients are the forerunners of the international multi-center Q-Symbio Study of the Effect of Coenzyme Q10 on Morbidity and Mortality in Chronic Heart Failure. In that study, 106 weeks of adjunctive treatment of chronic heart failure patients with 3 times 100 milligrams of a daily ubiquinone Coenzyme Q10 supplement in addition to conventional heart failure medicine was associated with significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and hospitalizations as compared to placebo. In the European segment of the Q-Symbio Study, the active Coenzyme Q10 treatment also increased the patients‚Äô left ventricular ejection fraction significantly. During a period of high exertion in 1998, Judy had a major heart attack. This left him with a very weak heart. Taking Coenzyme Q10 for the past 20 years has improved his heart function, and he has had a very productive and healthy life since the heart attack. = Heart surgery patients = In 1993, Judy reported the results of a clinical trial of the efficacy of Coenzyme Q10 supplementation of heart surgery patients. One group of patients received 100 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10 per day for 14 days prior to the surgery and for 30 days following the surgery. The other group of patients received a placebo for the same periods. Patients in both groups had a documented blood Coenzyme Q10 deficiency (< 0.6 micrograms per milliliter), low cardiac index (< 2.4 l/m2 per minute), and low left ventricular ejection fraction (< 35%) prior to the Coenzyme Q10 treatment. Pre-surgery supplementation improved blood Coenzyme Q10 and heart muscle tissue Coenzyme Q10 levels and heart muscle tissue ATP significantly compared to the placebo supplementation. Cardiac index and ejection fraction also improved but not to the level of statistical significance. Post-surgery supplementation was positively associated with the maintenance of normal blood and heart muscle tissue Coenzyme Q10 levels and normal heart muscle tissue ATP levels and with significantly improved cardiac index and ejection fraction. The course of recovery in the Coenzyme Q10 supplemented group was short (3‚Äì5 days) and uncomplicated. By contrast, the course of recovery in the placebo group was longer (15‚Äì30 days) and more complicated. There was a positive relationship between blood and heart muscle Coenzyme Q10 levels, heart muscle ATP levels, and indicators of heart function, on the one hand, and post-operative recovery time, on the other hand. = Chronic fatigue syndrome = In 1998, Judy reported the results of a study of Coenzyme Q10 supplementation of chronic fatigue syndrome patients. Two groups of patients, similar in age, exercise tolerance, and duration of illness were given 100 milligrams and 300 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10, respectively. 60% of the patients in the 100-milligram group responded to the treatment; 91% of the patients in the 300-milligram group responded. In the non-responders, the blood and tissue CoQ10 levels did increase with the supplementation but not to the extent that they increased in the responders. The average time to a discernible change in exercise tolerance and recovery time was 30 days in the group of patients who took 300 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10 daily and 60 days in the group of patients that took 100 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10 daily. The increased dosage of Coenzyme Q10 yielded greater effectiveness. By 180 days, patients in both groups had experienced significant improvements in exercise tolerance and recovery time. Interestingly, despite the statistically significant increases, the chronic fatigue syndrome patients supplemented with Coenzyme Q10 could not reach the exercise tolerance levels of normal individuals, at least not within 180 days of supplementation. When the patients taking the Coenzyme Q10 were switched over to placebo, they reverted to the pre-Coenzyme Q10 treatment levels with 60 days (the 100-milligram group) and 90 days (the 300-milligam group). In addition to chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic heart failure, there are numerous low-energy conditions to which the bio-energetic effects of Coenzyme Q10 can plausibly be extended: fibromyalgia, Huntington's chorea, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Prader-Willi syndrome, and some forms of cancers. Once humans reach adulthood, Coenzyme Q10 bio-synthesis begins to decrease with increasing age, resulting in less energy. The KiSel-10 Study of combined Coenzyme Q10 and selenium supplementation of senior citizens for years has shown that daily supplementation with 2 times 100 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10 and 200 micrograms of selenium is associated with significant reduction of cardiovascular mortality, significant improvement of heart function, and significant improvement of health-related quality of life. = Cancer = Dr. Folkers and Judy did case studies of the effects of Coenzyme Q10 on various cancers in patients with congestive heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 put the cancers into remission, improved heart function, and reduced the degree of heart failure. In 1998, Judy reported that PSA and prostate mass decreased following the treatment of prostate cancer patients with high dosages of Coenzyme Q10 (600 milligrams per day). However, the Coenzyme Q10 treatment did not take effect rapidly. It took 60 ‚Äì 80 days before the researchers began to see a drop in the PSA scores and the prostate mass measurements. By 180 days of supplementation, PSA and prostate mass were significantly reduced in all of the responding patients. At 360 days of supplementation, PSA and prostate mass were reduced by 73.6% and 48.4%, respectively. Younger early-onset prostate cancer patients were the best responders to the Coenzyme Q10 treatment. The poorest responders to the Coenzyme Q10 treatment were the oldest and most severe patients with the highest PSA, the largest prostate glands, and metastasis to adjacent tissues and bones [10]. In the responders, blood Coenzyme Q10 levels increased five-fold with the supplementation, and lymphocyte counts increased to normal levels. In non-responders, the blood Coenzyme Q10 levels increased only two-fold, and the lymphocyte counts remained essentially unchanged. Judy and Dr. Folkers suggested that Coenzyme Q10 stimulation of immunoglobulin G antibodies and T4/T8 lymphocytes as well as possible positive effects of Coenzyme Q10 on cytotoxic T-cells might explain the observed prostate cancer regression. In a 1984 study, Judy reported that Coenzyme Q10 supplementation could help to offset the inhibitory effects of the chemotherapy drug adriamycin (doxorubicin) on the bio-synthesis of Coenzyme Q10 and could alleviate the cardio-toxicity of the drug. Adriamycin is an established chemotherapeutic drug with known anti-tumor effects; however, its use was limited by its documented cardio-toxicity at higher dosages. In the study, Judy and his co-researchers started the Coenzyme Q10 supplementation at a dosage of 100 milligrams per day three to five days before the adriamycin treatment began. The Coenzyme Q10 treatment proved to be effective in cancer patients with normal cardiac function prior to the commencement of the adriamycin treatment. These Coenzyme Q10-treated patients could take a significantly higher total accumulated dosage of adriamycin without any significant changes in cardiac hemodynamics or kinetics as compared to chemotherapy patients not on Coenzyme Q10. In the cancer patients with low cardiac function prior to the initiation of therapy, Coenzyme Q10 treatment did not produce the same beneficial results. Judy interpreted this outcome as an indication that patients with baseline low cardiac function are at risk for cardio-toxicity caused by adriamycin therapy. = Parkinson‚Äôs disease = Judy and the SIBR Research group have supplemented several Parkinson's patients with Coenzyme Q10 in the period from 1995 to 2019. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been found to decrease the progression of Parkinson's disease in early-onset Parkinson's disease but not in patients with full-blown disabling disease. Many of these early-onset disease patients have been functional for as many as 24 years [1 p 135]. = Prader-Willi syndrome = Especially of concern to Judy has been the treatment and care of children with Prader-Willi syndrome. These children suffer from a rare genetic disease that results in poor sucking reflex, muscle weakness, fatigue, and a constant feeling of being hungry (inability to feel full). Because of their inability to exercise caused by their muscle weakness and their insatiable appetites coupled with an inability to convert carbohydrates to energy, these children can become overweight and obese. In 1999, Judy conducted a one-year study of children aged three months to six years diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome. He matched the Prader-Willi children in the study with normal children of similar age and sex. The Prader-Willi children in the study had a mean plasma Coenzyme Q10 concentration of 0.38 micrograms per milliliter. The children tolerated the Coenzyme Q10 treatment well. The children who were receiving tube feeding because they were too weak to suckle began to suckle 10 days after the initiation of the Coenzyme Q10 supplementation. The children who were of an age to be able to walk but could not walk because of muscle weakness began to take their first steps two to three weeks after they started on the Coenzyme Q10 treatment. In 2000, Judy together with his colleague Dr. Stogsdill started the Cyto-Med company, which supplies Coenzyme Q10 to children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Cyto-Med ships Coenzyme Q10 to children in 14 different countries. Prader-Willi children's cells cannot synthesize adequate quantities of Coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation is necessary to make up for the failure to synthesize Coenzyme Q10 and to lessen the resulting developmental difficulties.  Coenzyme Q10: Facts or fabrications  In 2007, Judy wrote a seminal paper about the crystalline Coenzyme Q10 raw material. He emphasized the need for the crystals to be dissociated into single free molecules to be absorbed, and he discussed the simple passive facilitated diffusion process by which the molecules can be absorbed in the small intestines. He explained the transport of the fat-soluble Coenzyme Q10 molecules, their conversion from the oxidized form, ubiquinone, to the reduced form, ubiquinol, and the importance of the supplement formulation for the bio- availability of Coenzyme Q10. He concluded by elucidating the biological functions of the ubiquinone and ubiquinol molecules.  Non-invasive transthoracic bio-electrical impedance method  Already in 1981, Judy did a study showing that the transthoracic electrical impedance method for measuring cardiac output in humans warranted further consideration as a non-invasive clinical tool that will be applicable in the investigation of the hemodynamics of normal and altered physiological states. As a graduate student and NIH fellow at Baylor University Medical School (1963), Judy was introduced to the bioelectrical impedance method as a noninvasive means of measuring stroke volume and cardiac output. He helped develop this method for space flight in 1964 and 1965. He implemented this system in the clinical arena in 1971. After 56 years of development, this technology has drastically improved as a result of Judy's research. Total cardiac function can be measured by this system. The measurements include not only stroke volume and cardiac output but also left ventricular end diastolic filling volume and ejection fraction. Using a scanning system, total coronary blood flow can be measured as well as the location and magnitude of inter-vascular stenosis. These systems are used around the world in clinical screening of cardiac function and in research. The non-invasive bioelectrical impedance technology is a low-cost high technology system designed by Judy as a solution to high cost of cardiac diagnostic procedures.  Research findings  Judy's research into the absorption, bio-availability, and clinical effects of Coenzyme Q10 have led him to the following conclusions: * The oxidized form, ubiquinone, is the more stable and better documented form of Coenzyme Q10. It is an electron acceptor. It is essential in the process of cellular ATP energy generation. * The reduced form, ubiquinol, is the antioxidant form. It is an electron donor. It neutralizes superoxides and harmful free radicals. By its nature, it is less stable than the ubiquinone form. * The benzoquinone head and the isoprene tail of the ubiquinone molecule are created in the mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, and in organelles called peroxisomes. The head and the tail section are joined together in a condensation reaction. Ubiquinol is converted from ubiquinone by oxidoreductase enzymes. * In the Coenzyme Q10 cycle, all three redox forms of Coenzyme Q10 ‚Äì ubiquinone, ubiquinol, and the unstable intermediate form semiubiquinone ‚Äì are converted from one form to the other. * Regardless of whether the oral Coenzyme Q10 supplement is ingested in the ubiquinone form or the ubiquinol form, the Coenzyme Q10 will be absorbed in the ubiquinone form and will be rapidly converted to the ubiquinol form in the lymph. It will enter the blood circulation predominantly in the ubiquinol form.

The short has won several international prizes. Title Kuproquo is an invented portmanteau made up of the French words cul (pronounced ku), \\"ass\\", and quiproquo, derived from the Latin phrase quid pro quo, but having a narrower meaning: \\"a thing mistaken for another thing\\". Plot A cold open of an ordinary quiet evening at home in which a family of three are about to have dinner. At the dining table, six-year-old J√©r√©mie (J√©r√©mie T√©rence-Gaudet) asks what \\"bugger\\" means. Black and white images of the parents and J√©r√©mie from a few years past flow, set to music. The boy's parents are taken completely by surprise, asking where he heard that word; he tells them (someone named Olivier), and they proceed to argue over possible bad influences. Charles () also complains that francophones use unhelpful words like \\"bugger\\" and prefers \\"ass hole\\". His son knows what that word means, at least. J√©r√©mie repeats his question. Charles claims he does not know, which draws an immediate objection from Genevi√®ve (Maude Gu√©rin). Charles now tells the boy his mother will explain. Again Genevi√®ve objects, pointing out that Charles is a psychologist. Increasingly rattled, Charles lights a cigarette at the table and asks Genevi√®ve to tell their son something while he tries to come up with a real answer. She uses a gardening metaphor, explaining that \\"buggering\\" is like planting carrots in an alley rather than in the ground. Charles calls the explanation infantile and out of date, harking back to the psychology of the 1950s. Children are not stupid, he says, and should be told how things really are. While J√©r√©mie plays on his Nintendo, his parents debate what to say. Neither wants to reveal the ins and outs of sex between a mommy and daddy to their six-year-old son, never mind anal sex and possibly homosexuality, particularly Charles, prompting Genevi√®ve to ask him if he has gay thoughts when the two of them have anal sex, which turns their discussion into a heated conversation about their sex life and attitudes towards sex. Charles is surprised that Genevi√®ve does not really like anal sex, as sometimes it is painful. She argues angrily that a man's desire for it is based on a need to express virility by asserting dominance over his partner, and calls out to J√©r√©mie to return to the kitchen, repeating Charles' words to him about children. Charles tells J√©r√©mie he should not use \\"bugger\\" anymore, as it's a bad word. He tells his son that \\"buggering\\" is like a rear- end collision. Apparently satisfied, the boy asks if he can play on his Nintendo again and Charles says yes, and lights another cigarette as his wife stares at him. At the school playground, J√©r√©mie takes Charles' explanation literally, running into another boy, knocking him over, and shouting: \\"I buggered you! I buggered you!\\". He is asked where he learned the word, leading to a gross misunderstanding, as the boy overheard his parents talking about their anal sex acts. His half-understood version of life at home leads to Charles being arrested by the police and a visit with Genevi√®ve from child protection services. Music plays again with a fade to black and the end credits roll.

Inspiration and themes Jean- Fran√ßois Rivard said the idea for the story arose from his own childhood, when his older cousin used to sing off-colour songs, and once told him a sodomy joke which he retold but without understanding it. His father thought it was funny until the young Rivard asked him to explain it. =Taboo topics and children in the information age= People living in an information age are bombarded with unfiltered information, children included, who seem more precocious than past generations due to the excess of information available, making questions like the boy's more likely. The film asks how parents and society deal with their questions when they arise: how one explains taboo (adult) concepts like suicide, sodomy, abortion to a child. Production =Background and financing= Locomotion Films, part of the Montreal Exponent Group, comprising commercial houses La Fabrique d'Images and S.W.A.T Films, and post and digital effects house Buzz Image Group, was officially launched the same year as the film's release in 1999 with a view to developing English- and French-track feature films, television series, and dramatic shorts like Kuproquo and Jean-Fran√ßois Asselin's La Petite Histoire d'un homme sans histoire. Marc S. Grenier, one of Locomotion's producers, said the Group was ready \\"to do something entirely serious\\", moving into fiction after working many years in commercials. Executive producer Denis Martel was also president of Locomotion. Kuproquo is 's fourth short film, the third following his debut Kopps, which won two prizes at the Vid√©aste competition in 1997. The project received funding from both provincial and federal levels of government, including SODEC, Telefilm Canada, and Radio-Canada. =Casting and characters= Rivard said that in most of his previous films, he enjoys putting his characters into embarrassing situations and watching them try to extricate themselves from them. Normally, the characters are in their twenties, but for Kuproquo, he wanted to \\"change universe\\" and focus on a slice of life of two young parents in their thirties. Jacques Dutronc in 1966 =Filming and music= Kuproquo was shot on 16 mm film and then blown up to 35 mm. The song which plays over the brief title sequence following the cold open and during the end credits is \\"Fais pas ci, fais pas √ßa\\", the second track from Jacques Dutronc's second self-titled studio album (1968). Release Released in July 1999, Kuproquo was one of a very few contemporary Quebec films to reach a wider audience, according to Michel Coulombe. In November, it was reported that the short was expected to be shown accompanying another (unspecified) French-Canadian feature film in Quebec theatres. =Home media= Kuproquo was released on both VHS and DVD formats in 1999 and 2000, and on DVD again in 2009. =Streaming= The short has been available for streaming from TOU.TV since 2010. Reception Kuproquo is described both as a \\"successful\\" and \\"quality\\" film. =Critical response= Denise Pelletier called Kuproquo a well directed and very funny film with excellent actors, subjecting contemporary qu√©becois to scrutiny through a lens tinged with irony: Charles and Genevi√®ve believe they are a modern open minded couple but balk when confronted by a frustratingly embarrassing question from their son. However, Rivard does not sit in judgement over them; more like a spectator, he presents a point of view with his particular form of transposition: a good dose of humour. =Audience response= Rivard was stunned by the positive audience reactions at each screening of his film at the many film festivals in Quebec. =Selected accolades= Kuproquo won many international prizes over several years.

Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter stated that the film's use of poetry \\"[casts] a fresh light on such familiar movie tropes as the listless traipse of modern-day searchers through overstocked supermarket aisles [...] From morning birdsong to the rustle of leaves in the breeze, from the stutter of stalled car engines to the spare and poignant score, there's nothing extraneous in Gavigai [sic]. As in the best poetry, each image and every sound has the rigor and grace of a well-turned line.\\" Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine also gave the film a highly positive review and argued, \\"There‚Äôs a little of Terrence Malick in Gavagai‚Äôs poetic sensibility, but director and co-writer Rob Tregenza lacks Malick‚Äôs precious need to flaunt erudition‚Äîto bang us on the head with the existential importance of the proceedings.

He knows that even our meaningful encounters with strangers tend to be fleeting ones; he also knows that people are almost always slower to reveal themselves than the movies allow time for.\\" In Film Journal International, Simi Horwitz praised the footage of the Norwegian scenery, stating, \\"The natural world is almost mystical and takes on the quality of a character, especially in the rainy scenes that mirror the characters‚Äô shed and unshed tears‚Äîadmittedly a clich√©, but visually evocative and emotionally stirring nonetheless.‚Äù However, Horwitz criticized the intentional omission of subtitles in scenes containing German or Chinese (rather than Norwegian), as well as the fact that some characters are unnamed.

Early life and education She was born in Carlow, Ireland in 10 May 1831. She moved to Rochdale, Lancashire to learn millinery and dress making from a friend of her relatives. Lahee didn't like the career and instead became a professional writer. At the time she published, Lahee concealed that she was both Irish and a woman. She published under MRL initially and then later as M.R.Lahee. She also wrote in the female perspective and touched on women's rights. Edwin Waugh said of her first novel that it was the best story in the Lancashire dialect. Lahee lived in Rochdale with Susannah Rothwell Wild for over thirty years. The women were buried in the same grave when they died. Lahee requested their grave should read They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in death they were undivided. However there were difficulties in arranging the burial and the inscription was never erected. It was not clear if the difficulty was because she was Irish, a woman or because assumptions about her sexuality. She was one of the four dialect writers to be included in the monument to Lancashire dialect writers in Rochdale. In part her inclusion was at the successful campaign by Wild. Edward Sykes, a local architect, created the monument and it was completed in 1900. John Cassidy was the artist who created the portraits. The monument commemorates Margaret Rebecca Lahee, Oliver Ormerod, John Trafford Clegg and Edwin Waugh and it is in Broadfield Park, Rochdale.

His senior commands include the post of chief of the General Staff and commanding officer of the 3rd Military District and the 3rd Division. Ryding also served as Minister for War for five years Career Ryding was born on 28 August 1831 at Sandg√§rdet, near V√§nersborg, in V√§stra Tunhem socken, √Ñlvsborg County. He was the younger brother of Gustaf Ryding (1833‚Äì1901), future Governor of V√§sternorrland County. He passed studentexamen in Uppsala in 1849 and was commissioned as an officer in the G√∂ta Artillery Regiment in 1851 with the rank of Underl√∂jtnant. Ryding was promoted to Captain there in 1863. In 1861‚Äì70 he served as a teacher of physics at the Higher Artillery School (H√∂gre artilleril√§roverket) in Marieberg and in 1863‚Äì72 he also served as a teacher of artillery and handguns at the Royal Military Academy. Furhermore, Ryding was a teacher of mathematics and physics at the Pharmaceutical Institute (Farmaceutiska institutet) from 1861 to 1875. After having served as secretary in the Defence Committee (F√∂rsvarsutskottet) in the Riksdag of 1871, Ryding was appointed General Staff Officer the following year and was promoted to Major in the army that same year. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the General Staff in 1873, he assumed the post of Chief of the Military Office of the Ministry of Land Defence (Lantf√∂rsvarsdepartementets kommandoexpedition) in 1873. In 1875 he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and appointed commanding officer of the J√§mtland Ranger Corps, from which he was transferred in 1879 as Colonel and regimental commander of Skaraborg Regiment. In February 1882, he was appointed Major General and Chief of the General Staff, but only held this position for a few months, when in June of that year he was appointed Council of State (Statsr√•d) and head of the Ministry of Land Defence, commonly known as Minister for War. In this capacity, he presented to the Riksdag of 1883, that of the 1880 Land Defence Committee's (Lantf√∂rsvarskommitt√©n), of which he was a member, large drafted proposal of a new army order; based on recruited regular troops and conscripts. However, despite the careful investigation of the defence issue and the persuasive manner in which Ryding fought for the implementation of the proposal, it was not adopted, mainly for the reason, that the Andra kammaren, by an overwhelming majority, decided to delete the provision contained in the proposal on the formation of reserve troops for the army, after which the F√∂rsta kammaren rejected the proposal on the method of procurement of the regular troops. The fate, which thus affected the government's proposal, resulted in Ryding (along with the other members of the cabinet) asked for resignation from the cabinet, which, however, was not granted to him. Over the next few years, Ryding tried with great energy on the \\"partial path of reforms\\" provide at least some increase in Sweden's defence force, but most of the proposals for that purpose, which were presented to the Riksdag, were stopped against the thrift of the Andra kammarens majority. However, when the Riksdag did not grant the necessary funds, Ryding resigned in 1887 from the cabinet. However, in 1885, he had been appointed commanding officer of the 3rd Military District (Tredje milit√§rdistriktet), which position along with the associated command of the 3rd Division (Tredje f√∂rdelningen) he held until 1896, when, broken by a long-standing illness, he retired from military service. Prior to that, in 1892, he had been promoted to Lieutenant General. In 1883‚Äì87 Ryding was a member of the F√∂rsta kammaren for V√§sternorrland County and in 1891‚Äì92 a member of the Andra kammaren for the cities of Mariestad, Sk√∂vde and Falk√∂ping. Ryding was a member of the Committee on Construction Basics for Gun Carriage to Field Cannons (Kommitt√©n ang√•ende konstruktionsgrunder f√∂r lavett till f√§ltkanoner) in 1872, in the Committee on the Defense of the Inlets to Stockholm and other Ports (Kommitt√©n ang√•ende f√∂rsvaret av inloppen till Stockholm och andra hamnar) from 1878 to 1879 and (for some time) in the Land Defence Committee (Lantf√∂rsvarskommitt√©n) from 1880 to 1882; Chairman of the Committee on Field Management and Stage Regulations (Kommitt√©n ang√•ende f√§ltf√∂rvaltnings- och etappreglementen) from 1888 to 1892; member of the Army Order Committee (H√§rordningskommitt√©n) from 1890 to 1891; Chairman of the Committee on Armament Plans for the Fortifications in the Stockholm Archipelago (Kommitt√©n ang√•ende bestyckningsplaner f√∂r bef√§stningarna i Stockholms sk√§rg√•rd), etc. from 1891 to 1892. Personal life Ryding married on 5 January 1875 in V√§nersborg to Jenny Christina Rosalia (Rosalie) Petersson (5 February 1842 in Stockholm ‚Äì 22 March 1925 in Stockholm), the daughter of Carl Gustaf Petersson and Johanna Maria Winberg. They had three children; Karin Astrid Kristina (born 3 April 1878), Jenny Marika Charlotta (20 August 1880 ‚Äì 6 January 1955) and Johan Karl Axel (born 23 April 1882). Ryding died on 7 February 1897 in Sk√∂vde. He was buried at Sankta Elin Cemetery in Sk√∂vde.

He is regarded as a major icon of Philippine golden age of church music for his extensive contribution to religious music in the Philippines throughout his career. Early life Adonay is the eldest of the 11 children born to farmers Mariano Adonay and Prudencia Quiteria in the town of Pakil, Laguna in the Philippines, then under the colonial rule of the Spanish Empire. The exact date of his birth is unknown but official documents indicated his baptismal date to be on February 6, 1848, and has been recognized as his de facto birth date. However, researchers suggested that baptism in the town at that time was generally performed within a day after birth, making February 5, 1848 as his probable date of birth. His father, aside from being a farmer, also played wind and brass instruments as a member of one of the town bands. Adonay in his early childhood showed enthusiasm for his father's musical instruments. As was the custom for boys during the Spanish colonial times, he was then involved in the ecclesiastical music tradition of his town. In 1856, poverty led his parents to entrust him to the care of Augustinian priests in Intramuros, Manila who discovered his talent for music. In San Agustin Church, he apprenticed as a sacristan and a tiple. Under the friars, he was provided with daily sustenance, proper education, and access to musical environment but was also subjected to strict and harsh discipline. Adonay has an absolute pitch, and supple, flexible voice which helped his musical learning despite having limited formal music education. His musicality delighted his choirmasters and he rose to the position of primer tiple. He mastered solfeggio, and learned chords, chord positions, and their resolutions on the organ by watching fellow organists. According to oral history, his proficiency in instruments includes the organ, piano, violin, contrabass, flute, and trumpet. Career Adonay was already composing music for the use in the liturgy at the age of 21. Samples of his early works such as \\"Benedictus\\" and \\"Libera me, Domine\\" which were meant for performance at San Agustin were reportedly sent to Spain for expert evaluation. In 1870, Adonay set up Capilla de San Agustin, a 25-piece orchestra meant for masses and for special celebrations. This earned him the title of Maestro di Capella. His leadership was described by all accounts as strict, meticulous, and demanding. Throughout his career, he had been active in organizing musicians. In 1885, he had been elected record keeper of the newly founded Union Artistico Musical, one of the first organization of professional musicians in the colony. He was a founding member of the Sociedad Musical Filipina de Santa Cecilia, formed in 1888. Other music schools and academies he was involved in organizing includes, the short-lived Centro de Bellas Artes (1902), the Philippine Musical Association (1907), and the Asociacion Musical de Filipinas (1912). In 1886, Manuel Arostegui a thoroughly trained Spanish church musician arrived in Manila as head of a delegation of Augustinians. He was impressed with Adonay's self-taught mastery of harmony and earlier sent him a book on counterpoint. Adonay observed and assisted Arostegui in all aspect of musical life in church which gave him access to current styles and techniques in European music. Arostegui left the colony and returned to Spain in 1887. With the Capilla de San Agustin, Adonay would then conduct Beethoven's Missa Solemnis on August 28, 1887, which was supposed to be conducted by Arostegui. Under his orchestral leadership are noted musicians Andres Dancel, a violinist, and Antonio Garcia, an organist. The performance was the tour de force of his career and of his subjects. Under Adonay, the Capilla de San Agustin's major performances includes Antonio Reparaz's \\"Missa a 3 voces\\" on August 23, 1891, and Hilarion Eslava's \\"Misa Grande\\" and Adonay's \\"Benedictus\\" in March 1893. By 1893, Adonay was one of the most prominent and successful native Filipino musicians in Manila. Aside from his church music duties, he also taught and tutored music. Adonay taught music at Colegio de Santa Catalina, Colegio de Santa Rosa, Colegio de San Sebastian, Liceo de Manila and La Campa√±ia de Jesus. One of his students was a prominent businessman and music patron Francisco L. Roxas, who will later on be executed for treason during the Philippine Revolution. He mentored famed composer Francisco Beltran Buencamino Sr. at Liceo de Manila. He also encouraged and recognized the musical talent of noted violinist Ernesto Vallejo, whom Adonay gifted his first violin. During the Philippine Revolution, Adonay's work \\"Te Deum\\", which is meant to be played in a mass of thanksgiving for victory in battle, was first performed on July 7, 1897. A letter written to Emilio Jacinto by a musician named Guillermo Lisboa y Bagayan in Longos on January 15, 1899 mentioned Marcelo Adonay's arrangement of \\"Marcha Real Filipina\\" with instruction that it will be played when the Katipunan enters Manila. It was also purported that Adonay composed a march in honor of Antonio Luna. On June 13, 1900, the San Juan del Monte Orchestra performed his \\"Adonay's Mass... in honor of San Antonio\\" at the Quiapo Church. Adonay's \\"Peque√±a Misa Solemne\\" was first performed on August 28, 1904 at San Agustin Church. From 1908 to 1911, he served as a judge on music competitions for the annual Manila Carnivals. At the funeral of zarzuela and soprano singer Maria Evangelista Carpena on March 8, 1915, he was tasked to conduct \\"Libera me, Domine\\". Walter Loving, a Philippine Constabulary bandmaster during the American occupation of the Philippines, requested a composition from Adonay who responded with a Toccata for Organ in C Major. Adonay's final public performance was a tone poem, \\"Rizal Glorificado\\", performed on December 30, 1911, the 15th death anniversary of one of the most celebrated Filipino hero Jose Rizal. The performance was commissioned by the Manila City Government held at the Manila Grand Opera House. In 1914, at the age of 66, Adonay formally retired from San Agustin and handed down his duties to his youngest brother Atanacio. In his golden wedding anniversary on January 17, 1924, he sponsored a composition competition which was won by a University of the Philippines professor Nicanor Abelardo. Personal life On January 17, 1874, Adonay was married at the Manila Cathedral to Maria Vasquez, an orphan from Malolos, Bulacan. He met Vasquez at Beaterio de La Compania de Jesus while serving as a music teacher. Somewhere prior to 1886, he settled in the suburb of Malate along with his wife. The couple reportedly had twelve children which among are Francisco, Marieta, and Liberata, the former died of bronchitis in infancy. His mother Prudencia died on 1877. At the age of 26, Adonay was considered as quite financially well-off and prudent. Even though his father was still alive, he financially supported his younger siblings. Atanacio, one of his siblings, lived in the couple's Malate home nearly all his professional career life and would later on replace his brother as the organist of San Agustin Church upon Adonay's retirement in 1914. His father Mariano died on August 14, 1900. Adonay's home life was quiet and circumspect. He preferred planting trees and gardening in the afternoon and playing violin or harmonium in the evening with his family. His home altar was framed by a large oil painting of St. Cecilia willed by his student Francisco Roxas after his execution during the Philippine Revolution. In his golden wedding anniversary on January 17, 1924, he sponsored a composition competition which was won by a University of the Philippines professor Nicanor Abelardo. =Death= At the age of eighty, Adonay had long been suffering with arthritis which was possibly a result of adult on-set diabetes. His experience with the illness was the inspiration for his humorous 1912 work \\"Ang Quirot ng Rayuma\\", for violin, cello, and harmonium. By 1927, Adonay was already mostly confined in bed due to the severity of complications of diabetes. He died on the early morning of February 8, 1928 in his home in Malate.

He was one of the most prominent figures of the Khwarezmian Jadid movement and the Young Khivans. Early life Born in 1887 in Khiva, the capital of the Khanate of Khiva, Rakhmonov graduated from the Khiva Madrasa, where he received a Sunni Islamic and partially secular education. In 1912, at the age of 26, he went to the Ottoman Empire through Iran, entering Istanbul University in 1913. During his time in Istanbul, he was acquainted with the idea of Jadid and made many friends and connections within the movement. He completed his studies in Istanbul in 1918 and returned to Khiva. In addition to his native Uzbek, Rakhmonov was fluent in Turkmen, Persian and Turkish. Later in his life, he learned Russian.Bekjon Ramonov - National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan . - Tashkent, 2000-2005. Political career After his return to Khiva, Rakhmonov met with Jadids from Khiva and its environs, joining their movement. Later, he joined the Young Khivans, who fought for the abolition of the monarchy in Khiva. After the Khivan Revolution and the expulsion of the monarchy, the Khorezm People's Soviet Republic was formed. Rakhmonov was present when the KPSR was created and participated in the drawing up of the new state. Immediately after the KPSR's formation on the territory of the former Khanate, Rakhmonov was appointed Minister of Education. In 1921, he became Chairmam of the Central Revolutionary Committee of the KPSR. In 1920-1921, he was also the editor of the Republican newspaper Inqilob Quyoshi (The Sun of Revolution). Thanks to his efforts, many schools teaching the Uzbek and Turkmen languages in the Arabic-Persian writing system were opened throughout the KPSR. In 1921, he opened Khiva National University (now Urgench State University), one of the first universities in Central Asia.Validiy, B—ûlinganni b—ûri er (Hotiralar), Tashkent, 1997.M. Matkarimov, Khorezm Republic: Davlat Tuzilishi, Nozirllari wa Itisodi, Urgench, 1993. In 1925, after the national-territorial demarcation of Central Asia, Rakhmonov became head of the Education Department of the Khorezm Okrug of the Uzbek SSR, where he worked until 1926. He also held smaller posts. He advocated for the use of the Uzbek and Turkmen languages, defending the rights of the population to study in their native language. He wrote many works on Uzbek folk music and was able to play folk musical instruments. He was still in close contact with the Jadid movement, being an active supporter of it.ziyouz.uz - Bekjon Raxmonov (1887-1929) Death Because of his beliefs, Rakhmonov had many enemies. In 1929, he was killed by employees of the Joint State Political Directorate of the USSR in unclear circumstances inside a ship on the Amudarya River near Urgench. He was 42 years old. His murder is hypothesized to be political by historians because of his views and beliefs.

Life  Gotthard descended from the ancient Saint Gall ministerial family Giel. His father was Rudolf Giel von Glattburg. His sister Amalia was Abbess of Magdenau from 1507 to 1532, his sister Johanna was a nun in the same monastery. Gotthard transferred monastic fiefs to his brothers Peter, Johann and Rudolf and provided his father with the dominion W√§ngi in the Canton of Thurgau.  Works  The Abbey of Saint Gall bought the dominion Glattburg in 1486. Gotthard from the family von Glattburg is first attested as conventual in the Abbey of Saint Gall in 1489; in 1490 he held the office of governor in Wil. On 18 March 1491, he was elected abbot. Shortly thereafter, Gotthard travelled to Rome to receive the papal confirmation of his abbacy on 9 May 1491. He received the correspondent consecrations from Bishop Titus Veltri of Castro in the church Santa Maria dell‚ÄôAnima on 15 May 1491. After his return to Saint Gall, he concluded a contract with Wil which regulated the rights of the prince abbot with regard to the city. Gotthard was generally very concerned about the consolidation of the prince abbot's rights and prerogatives. In 1492, he obtained the reintroduction of the tithe for the citizens of Gossau. Furthermore, Gotthard exerted himself for the reconstruction of the destroyed Abbey of Mariaberg in Rorschach which henceforth served for school and administration purposes. On 13 February 1497, he let the first grain and farmer's market be held in Rorschach. In the Swabian War, he supported the confederal towns with prince- abbot troop contingents. With regard to religion, he promoted, in accordance with his predecessor, the worship of Saint Gall's patron saint Gallus by commissioning a valuable reliquary for his bones. Abbot Gotthard cultivated a clientelistic administration. He favoured his family as well as loyal followers and let them have a share in the abbey's economic resources. This led to the establishment of a vow that Gotthard's successor had to take (dt. \\"Wahlkapitulation\\") which was supposed to prevent such practices.

It is in size. The house was built for the American entertainers Bob and Dolores Hope and completed in 1979. The house is noted for its large undulating triangular roof, with a large central light shaft. Location The house is located in a gated community in Palm Springs. It is located above Palm Springs, with panoramic views of the Coachella Valley and the San Jacinto Mountains. Design The grounds of the house contain a tennis court, putting greens, and a swimming pool. An outdoor fireplace in a large conical chimney is in the large exterior terrace of the house. The original roof design was a steel frame covered in wood. The design of the house has been likened to a mushroom, a volcano, and a spaceship. History The Hopes hired architect John Lautner for the project due to their admiration for his Elrod House nearby on Southridge Drive. When Bob Hope saw Lautner's model for the house in 1969 he quipped that \\"Well, at least when they come down from Mars they'll know where to go\\". The house was destroyed by a fire from a welder's torch in its initial phase of construction in 1973, the cost of the fire was estimated at $500,000. Construction began four year later after legal issues regarding insurance and financial responsibility for the fire were settled. Arthur Elrod, the chief interior designer for the house, died during the first phase of construction. When work began again in 1977 the original building plans as filed with the council were still valid. Dolores Hope became increasingly involved in the design of the house following its rebuild which caused Lautner to distance himself from the project. The Hopes hired a \\"Beverley Hills society decorator\\" to design the d√©cor of the house which dismayed Lautner who had originally envisaged a modernist interior that made use of the natural light in the house's desert location. Dolores Hope had been inspired by Sunnylands, the nearby house of Walter and Leonore Annenberg, with its pink roof. In February 2013, following Dolores‚Äô death that year and that of Bob Hope in 2003, the property was put on the market for $50 million; the price was dropped to $25 million in 2014 and finally sold for $13 million in 2016 to Ron Burkle.Elijah Chiland (November 15, 2016), Bob Hope's Lautner-designed Palm Springs home finally finds a buyer Curbed Los Angeles. Burkle owned the nearby Elrod House, also designed by Lautner, from 1995 to 2003. =Post 2016 remodelling= The former site architect of the Hope House, Helena Arghuete, managed the remodelling of the house following its 2016 sale. The modernist interior of the house as envisioned by Lautner was created by stripping the interiors and replacing the d√©cor with natural materials. Arghuete was assisted by Lorenzo Jauregui, whose mother was the Hope's maid for 34 years. The father and son woodworkers Brian Cooney Sr. and Brian Cooney Jr. constructed 12 new doors at the house to Lautner's design and installed African mahogany on the house's interior walls.

A striking if slightly unconventional outdoor exhibition area for many of her pieces is provided by the small vineyard on the edge of Dresden where she lives with her husband, (who in 2019 insisted to a reporter that his sculptor wife \\"brings more income home\\" than is delivered by the couple's 11 acre winery). Her public profile was raised by her figure of Trauerndes M√§dchen am Tr√§nenmeer (Grieving Girl at the Sea of Tears) which commemorates the bombing of the city in February 1945, and which was completed and installed at the city's Heidefriedhof cemetery (de) in 2010. Biography =Provenance and early years= Ma≈Çgorzata Chodakowska was born and grew up in the heart of Poland, at ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where between 1980 and 1985 she attended the Liceum Sztuk Plastycznyc (\\"Fine Arts Secondary School\\"). In 1985 she enrolled at the Fine Arts Academy in Warsaw where she studied sculpture with Jan Kucz. Three years later, in 1988, she moved on again, this time to the Academy of Visual Arts in Vienna, to progress her studies further. Her prize-winning dissertation, which she submitted in 1991, was supervised by Bruno Gironcoli. =Klaus and wine= In September 1989 Ma≈Çgorzata Chodakowska took a hiking trip in the Tatra Mountains (Polish side) with a couple of friends. While walking one day the girls fell into conversation with a solitary East German hiker. Klaus Zimmerling was a mechanical-electrical engineer from the Wachwitz (de) quarter of Dresden. (It later turned out that Zimmerling was a frustrated engineer, but a passionate hobby-winemaker.) That evening they agreed to team up for the final part of their break and at the end of the trip Chodakowska and Zimmerling exchanged addresses. Two weeks later she arrived at Dresden on the train from Warsaw to be met by Klaus clutching a bunch of flowers and solemnly unrolling a red carpet across the platform: they were evidently in love. Significant travel restrictions were still in force between central European countries in the \\"Soviet Empire\\", but 1989/90 was a period of massive and lasting social and political change. By the end of 1990 Chodakowska had joined her lover in Dresden and the couple were married. At this point, however, Ma≈Çgorzata Chodakowska still had not completed her course at the Academy in Vienna. Street protestors had breached the Berlin Wall in November 1989, however, and it became clear, after East Berliners‚Äîsome exultant and others merely intrigued‚Äîstreamed past bemused border guards, that neither the watching Soviet soldiers nor their East German proxies had received orders to kill. There would be no repeat of 1953. Long-standing restrictions on foreign travel rapidly disappeared and Zimmerling was able to accompany his bride to Austria where she completed her artistic studies in Vienna and he undertook a twelve month internship on an organic winery up-river at Wachau.Genia Bleier: Duett aus Rebensaft und Kunst. In: Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten, 30 December 2009, p. 11. =The business= Since 1991 Chodakowska has lived with her husband in Dresden and supported herself as a freelance sculptor. It was also in 1991 that she was accepted for membership of the Saxon Artists' Association (S√§chsische K√ºnstlerbund). At this point she was still living at Mei√üner Landstra√üe 141, close to the river and a short distance to the west of the city centre. In 1992 Zimmerling purchased his vineyard and over the next few years he was able to add to it. In 1995 they had acquired an old farmhouse on the eastern side of the city in Pillnitz near the eponymous Schloss, and positioned between the old royal vineyard formerly attached to the Schloss and the little vineyard the two of them had been managing together: the farmhouse became the couple's new home and business premises, while the vineyard became the backdrop for some of Chodakowska's sculptures. Over time more of her pieces have been erected in public places nearby. Images of her sculptures also appear on the labels of the wine bottles. Chodakowska states that inspiration for her sculpture comes from travel. A visit to Portugal inspired her oak-wood sculpture \\"Portugiesischer Sch√∂nling\\" (loosely, \\"little Portuguese beauty\\"). She says that another trip, this time to Egypt in 1996, enabled her to lose her reticence over working with gold.Birgit Grimm: Der Stamm, aus dem die Tr√§ume sind. In: S√§chsische Zeitung, 22 October 2005, p. 9. Visiting Cambodia in 2000, she was inspired by Khmer carved stone temple dancers that \\"revealed the embodiment of good and evil bound together in ecstatic unison\\". Ma≈Çgorzata Chodakowska's work is both attractive and skilfully promoted. She explained to an interviewer that in 2005 she reached the point that she no longer had to sell everything that she could produce to put food on the table. Since then she has generally retained her original hardwood sculptures, often displaying them on the family vineyard, while selling only the bronze castings produced from them. One speciality is her so- called \\"water sculptures\\" or \\"fountain figures\\" which combine an attractive (normally) female figure with a fountain. One (admittedly extreme) example of Chodakowska's commercial success was reported in 2010 when \\"√úberfluss\\" (\\"Abundance\\"), a 1.80-meter high bronze fountain figure completed in 2009, was sold to a businessman for ‚Ç¨50,000.SZ/kle: ‚Äö√úberfluss‚Äò soll Schwung ins Quartier an der Frauenkirche bringen. In: S√§chsische Zeitung, 20 November 2010, p. 17. Method As a student at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and later at Vienna, Malgorzata Chodakowska took the opportunity to work with a number of different themes and techniques.Lieselotte Sauer-Kaulbach: K√ºnstlerin freut sich auf Winningen. In: Rhein-Zeitung, 10 May 2008. In the end she decided to concentrate on presentations of the human form. She told an interviewer in 2008, \\"Working with the human form enables me to feel as close as possible to the figure I am working on, and so I have the feeling that this is the form I can best compose sculpturally\\". Her recurring theme is the so-called \\"Stammfrau\\" (loosely, \\"archetypal woman\\"), usually carved from wood to give a life-sized or slightly larger than life-sized form. She generally uses wood from uprooted trees, provided either by forestry authorities or by friends and acquaintances. She prefers to work with harder woods, often from fruit trees: linden, Pear wood, cherry wood, oak, tulip tree and, since 2010, ash. Depending on the hardness of the wood and the complexity of the design, a sculpture typically takes Chodakowska three or four months to carve. She prefers harder woods because, she says, she needs the \\"resistance of the wood\\" for her work. Her favourite timber variety is oak. Normally she starts by sketching a series of images for a sculpture with the help of a life model and using photographs of her model. The front view and profile sketches are then applied directly to the selected block of wood which is cut roughly to shape using a hammer and chisel. The finer image then \\"emerges\\" from the roughly cut tree trunk, with the human figure and the base forming a single block, the girth of the figure being constrained by the original diameter of the trunk selected: \\"For the 'Fata Morgana' an oak [trunk] with a 1.20m diameter was necessary\\". Smaller parts are rarely added.Heinz Wei√üflog: Neue Skulpturen von Malgorzata Chodakowska in der Galerie an der Schwebebahn. In: Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten, 12 May 2000, p. 16. During her earlier period Chodakowska left her figures as simple unenhanced wood images, often of nudes. Over time she developed an appreciation that colour can bring a new dimension, and make the surfaces appear more reminiscent of real human skin, so that her more recent images are usually \\"partly clothed\\", often with acrylic paint. Emphasis is placed on the face and on the garment. \\"You can use light acrylic paint to give the impression of clothing, which nevertheless comes with a diaphanous quality that does little to conceal the body\\".Sebastian Beutler: Sch√∂ne Menschen aus Holz. In: S√§chsische Zeitung, 13 January 2003, p. 10. The art historian Karin Weber comments that the resulting sculpted closely fitting dresses come across as a contemporary interpretation of the \\"wetlook style\\" (\\"nassen Stil\\") familiar to specialist scholars familiar with the sculpture of classical Greece. Since a visit to Egypt in 1996 Chodakowska has also worked with gold surfacing as an additional expressive device. Some of her sculptures are coated with a final glaze made of beeswax, linseed oil and turpentine, which enhances the clarity of the grain in the wood.Karin Weber: ‚ÄûTempelt√§nzerinnen‚Äú ‚Äì Holzskulpturen von Malgorzata Chodakowska in der Stadtgalerie Radebeul. In: Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten, 8 August 2001, p. 14. Along with her \\"Stammfrauen\\" (loosely, \\"archetypal women\\"), who are mostly modeled on dancers, Chodakowska has also sculpted a few \\"Stammm√§nner\\", and some couples, representations of children and busts. She explains her preference for sculpting with wood on the grounds that this material \\"communicates warmth. It is [therefore] especially suitable for representing people\\". Wood, \\"with its grained texture, [calls to mind] the tendons and veins in the human body\\". During the 1990s Chodakowska went through several years of working with tin and glass, notably with her \\"T√§nzerin\\" (\\"Dancing girl\\", 1993) figure, \\"Glasmenagerie\\" (1994) and \\"Liebespaar\\" (\\"Lovers\\", 1994) which combines both glass and tin. Since the mid 1990s she has, from time to time, worked in bronze, a necessary departure from her preference for working with wood when producing her hallmark fountain figures for outdoor display.

With no political party able to prove their majority in the legislative assembly, president's rule was imposed in the state following a recommendation by the Governor of Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The President's rule was later revoked and the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, formed a government with the help of a small faction of the Nationalist Congress Party, led by Ajit Pawar. After three days, Fadnavis and Pawar resigned. A new government was formed by the Maha Vikas Aghadi, a new alliance of Shiv Sena, the Indian National Congress, and the Nationalist Congress Party, under Uddhav Thackeray. Background Seat share of 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election The Maharashtra Legislative Assembly has 288 seats. In the 2019 election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 105 seats, Shiv Sena won 56, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) won 54, and the Indian National Congress (INC) won 44. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Samajwadi Party (SP) won two seats each while Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)) won one seat each. 23 seats were won by other parties and independents. 145 seats are required for a majority to form government. Two alliances contested the election: the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) or Maha Yuti, a BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) or Maha-aghadi between the NCP and INC.  Crisis  After the declaration of election results on 24 October, Shiv Sena declined to support the BJP to form the government, on demand an equal share in power which was promised by BJP. Shiv Sena also demanded the post of Chief Minister for 2.5 years according to 50-50 promise. On 8 November 2019, the Governor of Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari invited the BJP to form a government as the single largest party. However, the BJP declined to form the government on 10 November because it was unable to attain a majority. The invitation passed to the second largest party, Shiv Sena, to form government. On 11 November, the Governor invited the NCP to form government. The next day, after the NCP also failed to gain majority support, the governor recommended president's rule to the Council of Ministers of India and the President. This was accepted, and president's rule was imposed. The discussions between Shiv Sena, NCP and INC ended with the formation of a new alliance, Maha Vikas Aghadi. A consensus was finally achieved with Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray appointed Chief Minister after protracted negotiations. = First Government Formation = In the early hours of 23 November, the president's rule was revoked and BJP's Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as Chief Minister for a second consecutive term, while NCP leader Ajit Pawar was sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister. On the other side, NCP chief Sharad Pawar announced that Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP was his own and not endorsed by the party. The NCP split into two factions: one led by Sharad Pawar and the other led by his nephew Ajit Pawar. Later in the day, Ajit Pawar was removed as the parliamentary party leader of the NCP. He clarified that, despite joining hands with BJP, he is an NCP worker and will remain so. The next day Shiv Sena, the NCP, and the INC petitioned the Supreme Court regarding the discretion of the state governor to invite BJP to form government. Shiv Sena also requested the Supreme Court order the new government to prove majority in the legislative assembly. On 26 November, the Supreme Court ordered the new government to prove the majority in the legislative assembly by the evening of the next day. The same day, Ajit Pawar and Fadnavis resigned as Deputy Chief Minister and Chief Minister. Shiv Sena, the NCP, and the INC rounded up their MLAs after Fadnavis' oath and kept them sequestered in various hotels and buses to prevent horse- trading.https://www.news18.com/news/politics/resort-politics-begins-in- maharashtra-as-congress-mlas-headed-to-bhopal-shiv-sena-on-road-to- jaipur-2397757.html = Second Government Formation = The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA); a post-election alliance of Shiv Sena, NCP and INC with other small parties such as the Samajwadi Party and Peasants and Workers Party of India staked the claim to form a new government under the chief ministership of Uddhav Thackeray. The MVA leaders met the governor and submitted a letter of support of MLAs of MVA. Thackeray was sworn-in as the 19th Chief Minister of Maharashtra on 28 November 2019 at Shivaji Park in Mumbai.

Using archival performance footage, still photographs, and interviews with six surviving band members and others associated with the group, the film is considered one of the major catalysts for bringing attention in the 1980s to a women's band that performed in the late 1930s through the 1940s to primarily black audiences. The documentary was co- produced by Jezebel Productions and Rosetta Records, in association with Channel 4 (UK). Directors Schiller and Weiss established Jezebel as an independent film company \\"that reflected their political and artistic values\\" and their films \\"uncover stories of people and communities whose lives were overlooked and systematically erased from cultural memory\\". The film was screened at numerous film festivals in both the US and Europe, and has been included in college curricula and workshops. It aired on TV in the US, the UK, and other countries worldwide. Synopsis International Sweethearts of Rhythm opens with archival footage of Anna Mae Winburn on vocals and the band performing the song \\"Jump Children\\", interspersed with contemporary comments by Winburn, Tiny Davis, and Rosalind \\"Roz\\" Cron discussing the challenges the band faced due to gender, and celebrating the success of the band amongst their fan base. Throughout the film, except during interview sequences, the band's music is heard in the background, sometimes with still photographs of the band and individual members seen onscreen. The film discusses the origin of the band at the Piney Woods Country Life School in Mississippi in 1937, interspersed with archival footage of life at the time for African Americans in the rural South. Band members discuss the early touring years of the group, designed to raise awareness and funds for the Piney Woods School. The film discusses the transition of performance venues from schools and churches to theaters and night clubs, and the split of the band from Piney Woods School into a professional jazz band starting in 1941. Scenes are included of women performing many different types of non-traditional jobs during World War II, and Winburn discusses her former role as director of a male jazz orchestra that was interrupted when many of her musicians were drafted into US military service. Interviews include men associated with the band discussing how they felt about working with an all-female band. Trumpeter Tiny Davis talks about how she joined the band, and the effect that other professional musicians joining the group had on the quality of the band's performances. A comparison is made between all-white jazz bands popular at the time and the sound of the predominantly black Sweethearts. Archival footage includes the white singer Ina Ray Hutton and her all-female band, the Melodears. The popularity of the Sweethearts among black audiences is discussed, as well as the circuit of black theaters where they performed. Day-to-day life on tour is described, including the band sleeping on the bus while traveling through the segregated South. White musician Roz Cron talks about some of the ways she had to disguise herself in order to pass for black while in southern states, as well as help she received from people of color to avoid arrest because during that time and place, it was illegal for musicians of different races to perform together. The film also discusses members' rejection of the \\"novelty band\\" label due to their hard work which was comparable with male bands of the era. Tiny Davis' role as the heart of the band is mentioned and contemporary footage of her performing excerpts from the song \\"Mack the Knife\\" is included. Band members such as Vi Burnside and musical arranger Maurice King are given credit for their contributions to the band's sound. Top name performers of the time who were fans of the band are mentioned, such as Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Louis Armstrong, who was said to have tried unsuccessfully to convince Davis to leave the Sweethearts and join his band. Drummer Panama Francis recalls a \\"battle of the bands\\" between his all-male band and the Sweethearts. Newspaper headlines and anecdotal memories about long lines of fans waiting to get into the band's performances at places such as the Apollo Theater and the Regal Theater are shared. The band's European tours with the USO at the end of World War II are depicted. The film discusses the demise of the group due to lack of jobs for female musicians after service men returned home, as well as many Sweethearts leaving the band to start families of their own. The film ends with some members discussing the positive impact of the band on their lives, followed by an excerpt of the band performing one of their signature songs, \\"Jump Children\\". =Interviewees= The following musicians or others involved with the band are named and seen onscreen in an interview setting: *Anna Mae Winburn *Tiny Davis *Rosalind \\"Roz\\" Cron *Helen Jones *Helen Saine *Evelyn McGee *Jesse Stone *Al Cobbs *Panama Francis Some fans of the band are interviewed onscreen but they are not identified by their full names, so they are not included in this listing. =Performances= The closing credits do not include a listing of the songs performed by the Sweethearts in the film, but archival footage of excerpts of the songs \\"Jump Children\\" and \\"She's Crazy with the Heat\\" are presented, among several others. Production While Schiller and Weiss were doing research for Schiller's directorial debut film Before Stonewall (1985), they came across archival footage of the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. They had originally intended to include that footage in Before Stonewall to \\"show women doing untraditional things during World War II‚Äîthe men were away and the women could play\\". But they realized there was a film to be made about the Sweethearts, a band with which the filmmakers were previously unfamiliar. The \\"more we dug, the more incredible the story became. You know, what they had to put up with as women and as a mixed, but mostly black group.\\" That initial footage was from a short film called Jump Children, obtained from the film collection of David Chertok. His collection also included four other \\"soundies\\" that featured the Sweethearts during 1945 and 1946, after they returned from USO tours of Europe. Clips from those five soundies were used in the film. Other sources of film footage included a 1940s US government film about venereal disease \\"warning against the evils of jazz clubs, alcohol and women\\". The filmmakers located their interview subjects thanks to the work of Marian McPartland who had organized a Sweethearts reunion for the 1980 Kansas City Women's Jazz Festival. Band member Roz Cron provided information that allowed the directors to contact the former Sweethearts interviewed in the film. The film's opening credits state \\"Jezebel Productions and Rosetta Records presents\\". Rosetta Records had released a sound recording titled International Sweethearts of Rhythm in 1984, which featured sixteen songs from the band recorded in early 1945 and 1946. According to Rosetta Reitz's papers held at Duke University, she met producers Schiller and Weiss in 1983, and \\"the three, along with Reitz's daughter Rebecca, began to share creative responsibilities for the project. In 1986, with much of the work on the film completed, Reitz parted company with Schiller and Weiss over creative differences and disagreements over copyright license issues. Schiller and Weiss retained control of the project and began showing the finished film in late 1986.\\" The legal dispute between the parties ended in 1990. Financing for the film's production included a $15,000 grant from the New York State Council on the Arts. The film's closing credits also cite the following organizations as having provided grants for production costs: New York Council for the Humanities, The Women's Project of the Film Fund, and The Astraea Foundation. The producers also received a grant from the Women's Film Preservation Fund of New York Women in Film & Television for preservation efforts associated with the 2007 restored version released on DVD. Critical response Reviews of the film were generally positive. As of November 2019, there are no reviews or scores collected on Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. In her review for the documentary's premiere at the New York Film Festival, critic Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that the film is \\"a delightful 30-minute trip down memory lane. The group of the title is an interracial, all-women swing band that enjoyed enough popularity during the 1940s to be remembered affectionately by the fans who are interviewed here.\\" Reviewing the film upon its original release, Scott Cain from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote that the film \\"makes you glad that documentaries were invented. The film offers toe-tapping selections by the 1940s band interspersed with lively reminiscences by the participants, who have aged gracefully in the intervening 40 years.\\" In a review in the scholarly journal The American Historical Review, Vicki L. Eaklor says of the film that \\"oral and documentary history are blended masterfully to tell the story of a band that should not be forgotten‚Ä¶. Underlying it all, literally and figuratively, is the music, always the music: the sound track and footage of the band in performance evoke the 'International Sweethearts' more vividly than any artifact or recollection.\\" Reviewer Robert Arnett wrote in the journal Southern Quarterly: \\"The film is an interesting oddity. It touches many bases in its thirty minutes, yet does not develop any of them to a point that seems satisfactory or complete. The music, though, is irresistible, and the surviving bandmembers, especially Tiny Davis, are infectious in their enthusiasm for the band.\\" A review in The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, New York) stated \\"One of the significant issues raised in 'International Sweethearts of Rhythm' is that, had they not been women, let alone black women, a number of the band members might have enjoyed mainstream careers, and a more lasting fame. Another is that despite the prejudice of the time, these musicians experienced a freedom that then was rare for women, and that helped shape their lives.\\" A review in Library Journal, which helps librarians with purchasing decisions, concluded with \\"recommended for collections of jazz, black studies, or women's studies that can afford it\\". Similarly, a review of the 2007 \\"newly restored\\" DVD in Educational Media Reviews Online, an online database of reviews aimed primarily at academic librarians, gave the DVD its highest rating of \\"Highly recommended\\". As of October 2019, the film is held in 227 libraries worldwide. Screenings The film was shown primarily at film festivals in the United States between 1986 and 1989, with international festival screenings in subsequent years. One website states that the film was shown \\"at over 100 festivals worldwide\\". Although the film has no direct mention of homosexuality, some band members were openly gay and the directors also identify as lesbians, so the film has been included in some LGBT film festivals. Additionally, Jezebel Productions released another short documentary in 1988 featuring Sweethearts member Tiny Davis and her female partner of over 40 years; that film and International Sweethearts of Rhythm were often shown together at LGBT film festivals starting in 1988. The Sweethearts documentary has also been shown at some colleges and universities, frequently as part of classes or workshops on film, jazz history, or gender studies. It was also aired on television in the US, England, and other countries. =Selected film festival screenings= *New York Film Festival (World premiere: September 28, 1986); on a double bill, tickets to this screening were sold out in advance. *Seattle International Film Festival (May 17, 1987) *Philadelphia International Film Festival (July 25, 1987) *Toronto Festival of Festivals (September 12, 1987) *Boston Film Festival (September 20, 1987) *Jazz in the City Film Festival (San Francisco: August 28, 1988) *Chicago Lesbian and Gay International Film Festival (October 7, 1988); Sweethearts band member and Chicago resident Tiny Davis attended the screening *Northwest International Lesbian/Gay Film Festival (Olympia, Washington: February 1989) *Gay and Lesbian Film and Video Festival (Atlanta, Georgia: November 17, 1990) *Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (Tampa, Florida: June 21, 1991) *St. John‚Äôs International Women‚Äôs Film Festival (Newfoundland, Canada: 1991) *Festival du nouveau cin√©ma (Montreal, Canada: October 24, 1993) *Everett Women in Film Festival (Everett, Washington: March 21, 1998) *Full Frame Documentary Film Festival (Durham, North Carolina: 2003) *Lesbisch- Schwulen Filmtage (Lesbian Gay Film Days) (Hamburg, Germany: October 2007) =Television airings= The film made its television debut on December 29, 1986 on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Channel 4 was credited with production assistance for the film. The US television premiere was on March 6, 1987 on the Bravo cable television network. In 1994, it was included as part of a PBS series called Through Her Eyes that \\"featured the work of independent women producers and filmmakers on themes reflecting women's self-expression\\". The film's official website states that it was aired \\"in 13 countries including Britain, France, Holland, America (both PBS and Bravo), China, Denmark, Australia, Canada and Japan\\" and it has also been broadcast in Yugoslavia, Denmark, and Zimbabwe. =Other selected screenings= On December 4, 1990, the film was one of three documentaries screened as part of the second Smithsonian Residents film program hosted by the Hirschhorn Museum, as a \\"tribute to the careers of famous blues singers and musicians\\".

The gang perpetrated bank robberies and attacks in the early 1980s; its members came from the main far-right terrorist gang of this time, the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann. The Hepp-Kexel group was until the self-release of the NSU as the most important right-wing terrorist group in the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1982, the neo-Nazi gang robbed five banks in Germany to finance later actions and captured 630,000 D-Mark. Internally, the group called itself after their leaders Walther Kexel and Odfried Hepp. Hepp was a former member of the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann. According to Hepp, the group wanted to attract political attention with large terrostic attack, modeled on the IRA. Kexel and Hepp planned together with the right-wing terrorist Peter Naumann, to free the war criminal Rudolf Hess from Spandau Prison. After a row in the group, this plan was abandoned. Instead, the Hepp-Kexel group published a paper titled Farewell to Hitlerism. They called for an \\"anti-imperialist liberation struggle\\" against the US and Israel. The Hepp-Kexel group rented conspiratorial flats and set up weapons depots. Following the call, three car bomb attacks on US military personnel followed in Frankfurt, Butzbach and Darmstadt. All five members, except for Odfried Hepp, were arrested in February 1983. Three members surrender to the police in Frankfurt, Kexel and another member were arrested in the same month in England. Only Hepp, who had previously moved to West Berlin, was able to escape the planned for February 19, 1983 arrest by the Berlin police by fleeing to East Berlin.

Life  Franz von Gaisberg's father, Anton, first served the Austrians and then the French. His mother, Verena Hux, was the daughter of a wealthy Saint Gall weaver. Later, Franz von Gaisberg built a funeral chapel for his parents in the Abbey of Saint Gall, the so called Gaisberg chapel. Between 1477 and 1482, he took his religious vows. On 20 August 1488, he is first mentioned as priest. In 1491, he was probably domkustos; from 11 June 1496 onwards, he is attested as subprior. On 19 April 1504, when he held the office of acting subdean, he was elected abbot. Like his predecessor Gotthard Giel von Glattburg, he travelled to Rome for the papal confirmation. He received it on 12 June 1504, the correspondent consecration was given to him by Bishop Titus Veltri of Castri in the church of Santa Maria dell‚ÄôAnima.  Activities  During the first months of his term of office, Abbot Franz had to deal with a dispute between the prince abbey and the city of Wil. Pope Julius II settled this dispute on 3 June 1505 and regulated the rights of both parties very precisely. Abbot Franz aimed for an active acquisition policy. In 1505, he purchased the castle on the Rosenberg near Berneck and the property belonging to it for 5350 gulden from Junker Gallus Muntprat. In 1510, he bought the judicial rights of Balgach from Abbess Amalia von Lindau. From Jakob Blarer von Wartensee, he bought the tithe of Buchen and Staad in 1520. His economical policy provided the abbey with a solid financial base. Regarding cultural and religious matters, Franz achieved the canonisation of Notker the Stammerer as well as the endowment of the minster. He let the organ be refurbished, paintings be produced, new choir stalls be built and he bought precious mass drapery. As ally of the Swiss Confederancy, the Prince Abbot of Saint Gall was involved in its politics with regard to wars and alliances. In the context of the Italian Wars, the prince abbot first received papal pensions as well as papal confirmations of prerogatives. Thus, Leo X confirmed the incorporation of Rorschach, St. Margrethen, H√∂chst and Bernang into the prince abbot's jurisdiction in 1512. After the defeat at Marignano in 1515, Abbot Franz appeared as French party member. He received a French pension of 4000 francs. Driven by reformatory ideas, several riots occurred in the prince abbey's territory from 1520 onwards. In the course of the Peasant Revolts, on 1 May 1525, the subjects of the upper office (dt. \\"Oberes Amt\\") expressed their requests in articles in L√∂mmerschwil. In the Rapperswil contract from 17 July 1525, the standpoint of the abbey was largely accepted, however, soon after, the unrest in connection to the reformatory ideas developed a hardly controllable dynamic. In the late summer of 1527, the abbot left Saint Gall and fled first to Wil where the new belief had not yet managed to gain a foothold. The increasing unrest eventually forced him to retreat to the Abbey of Rorschach and afterwards to Castle Saint Anna in Rorschach where he was besieged by rebellious subjects. In Saint Gall, Joachim Vadian and Dominik Zili meanwhile implemented the reformation. On 23 February 1529, an iconoclasm took place in Saint Gall. Abbot Franz died on 23 March 1529 in Rorschach.

Johann founded several Party groups in western Austria. He became chairman of the Communist Party of Austria in Hallein. In 1920, he joined the RCP(b). In 1923 Johann emigrated to the USSR, where he became the first Austrian student at the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West in Moscow, which he left before the end of the 1923 one-year course. Haeckel-Erlich then moved to Kharkiv. There he began to work as an editor in the German department of the central publishing house. In Kharkiv in 1926, John became editor-in-chief of the atheistic magazine Neuland. This magazine was published in German and provided communist and atheist propaganda among the German-speaking population of the USSR.

Hans was arrested on December 10, 1933 for participating in the German counter-revolutionary organization, which set out to overthrow the Soviet regime by force of arms. In his house, two revolvers were discovered during a search. He was convicted under Article 54 of the Criminal Code of the Ukrainian SSR and incriminated by his relationship with the German consulate and Hitler‚Äôs agitation. By the decision of the NKVD troika under the college of the GPU of the Ukrainian SSR of May 29, 1934, he was imprisoned for 10 years in labour camp. Gockel served his sentence in Ukhtpechlag. In the camp, he was a senior rationing officer for the 9th detachment of railway construction. While in the camp, he was restrained on December 19, 1937 and sentenced on 05/01/1938 by the ‚Äútroika‚Äù under the administration of the NKVD of the Arkhangelsk Oblast under articles 58‚Äì10, 58-11 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR to capital punishment.

The film is inspired on the life of the Mexican popular singer Pedro Infante but focuses more on Pedro Guadalupe Ramos (Omar Chaparro), an impersonator of Infante. It is an original Netflix production and was released on 24 December 2019.  Plot  Pedro Infante has been detained in limbo for the past 60 years. Without permission to go to heaven, because he was a womanizer, he cannot be sent to hell either because he has also done much good. Pedro Infante prays for a second chance and is granted only one: he will be sent to Earth in the body of an imitator, Pedro Guadalupe Ramos (Omar Chaparro) and if he manages to straighten his life, he will be allowed to go to heaven. When he opens his eyes on the body of the impersonator, Pedro Infante falls in love at first sight with Raquel (Ana Claudia Talanc√≥n), Pedro Guadalupe's wife. But earning heaven will not be so easy since Pedro Guadalupe has followed in the footsteps of his idol and had been cheating on Raquel with her cousin Samantha (Stephanie Cayo).

Biography  Toppi was born in Ancona, Italy and moved to Florence in the 1920s. There, he began what would become a long collaboration with the publisher Nerbini, initially as a cartoonist for the satirical weekly Il 420 and as an illustrator for their novels. Toppi designed the headline logo and contributed comics to the Topolino, a weekly children's magazine themed on the Disney character Mickey Mouse. He also contributed to other Nerbini magazines such as L'Avventuroso, which was published starting from 1935.  Career  Toppi had a long history of contribution and publication with the Italian publisher Nerbini. Toppi was a contributor to the weekly Mickey Mouse-themed magazine Topolino, named after the character's Italian name. He was originally commissioned to design the headline logo and illustrate the first page comic strip for the inaugural edition, making him the first Italian author of a Mickey Mouse cartoon. Shortly after its 1932 launch, the magazine ran into problems regarding rights over the character and was temporarily re-spun into Il Giornale di Topo Lino, for which Toppi and Gaetano Vitelli created a new character, Topo Lino. After Nerbini had acquired the rights to Mickey Mouse and began publishing the original American cartoon strips, Toppi continued to contribute comics to Topolino, signing his work as \\"Stop!\\" and creating characters such as Sorci Jazz (first appearing in No. 9) and Sorcettino (a renamed Topo Lino). Toppi also contributed to other Nerbini magazines such as L'Avventuroso, in which he published adventure comic series. Toppi learned from major American series published in L'Avventuroso, absorbing the novelty of their graphical language and giving it his own spin. As one of the principal Italian contributors to the magazine, he became published on the last page, one of the reserved spaces of the magazine alongside the first page, with his main series alternating with, for example, Flash Gordon comic strips. His series La regina dei pirati (The Queen of the Pirates) features a vaguely feminist anti-hero as protagonist, while Una donna a bordo (A Woman on Board) had more comedic elements. In 1936, he published series such as I naufragatori misteriosi (The Mysterious Ship-Wreckers) and La regina d'Atalanta (The Queen of Atalanta). He created the first Italian detective series, Renato Gallo, which appeared in La Sfida del Bandito in the 1930s. Toppi would also produce illustrations for serialised novels appearing in L'Avventuroso. He illustrated most of the book covers dedicated to American comics characters such as Mandrake the Magician, Phantom or Tim Tyler's Luck.  References   External links  * Giove Toppi in INDUCKS.

The style reached its zenith during the reign of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, who founded the city of Hyderabad and constructed the Charminar as its centerpiece. The style is similar to that of the Bahmani Sultanate and other Deccan Sultanates, whose monuments can be seen in Gulbarga, Bijapur, and Bidar. It is heavily influenced by Persian architecture.

Charminar  The Charminar is one of the most recognizable examples of Qutb Shahi architecture. It was built by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 as a centerpiece for the newly built capital city of Hyderabad. The Charminar is a large building, square in plan, having an arch in each of its faces and a lofty decagonal minaret at each of its angles. To the south of the Charminar is the Mecca Masjid, which is one of the largest mosques of India. To the north of the Charminar is the Gulzar Houz fountain, which is surrounded by four arches called the Char Kaman. The arches are simple and do not have many embellishments. There used to be other Qutb Shahi palaces, as well as a rose garden in the vicinity, but they were probably destroyed during the Siege of Golconda.  Other monuments  Another early structure was the Purana Pul, built in 1578 across the Musi River. The Qutb Shahi rulers built elaborate caravanserais, or resthouses, including the Shaikpet Sarai and Taramati Baradari. The former had had 30 rooms, stables for horses and camels, a mosque and a tomb of an unknown sufi saint.

He was initially supervised by Vladimir Nalivkin, and was the teacher of Olga Alexandrovna Sukhareva. He was a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Early life Mikhail Stepanovich Andreev was born in Tashkent on September 24, 1873, as the grandson of a common soldier. He studied at the Tashkent gymnasium, transferring to the Tashkent Teacher's Seminary in 1889. As a seminarist, Andreev often visited the Tashkent old city, where he became close with some students at the madrasa there. Through these students, he met the family of Kaziy Sharif-Khoji and Ubaidulla-Maksum Mudarris of the Ishan Kuli-dodho madrasa, whom Andreev persuaded to give him classes on Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literature. During his years of training at the seminary, Andreev became ill and, on the advice of doctors, made trips to the mountains. When he was in Shymkent, he joined the Kyrgyz nomadic aul and went about his life with much care. In his subsequent trips to the outdoors, he frequently visited locations with good views (the upper reaches of Angren, the Ferghana Valley, Kyzylkum, the Matcha Mountains, etc.). Once, when he was visiting the Zarafshan glacier, Andreev returned through the Yangi-Sabak pass and subsequently traveled from Shakhrisabz to the Gissar Valley and the upper reaches of the Obihingou river to the Yaghnob River. He returned to Tashkent through Istaravshan.Akramova H., Akramov N. Orientalist Mikhail Stepanovich Andreev: Scientific-Blog. Essay / Ed. with a foreword from. B.A. Litvinsky. Dushanbe, 1973. Educator After graduating from the Tashkent Teacher's Seminary in 1893, Andreev worked in Khujand as the \\"head of evening courses for the local population\\". He visited various places in Central Asia, diligently collecting archaeological and ethnographic data. In 1894, he received an invitation to work as an oriental language trainer at the Tashkent Teacher's Seminary and at the Tashkent Practical School, on whose behalf he compiled a textbook on the Uzbek language. In 1896, he wrote a guide for educators on how to teach the Persian language.A guide for the initial teaching of the Sart language in the Tashkent Practical School. Tashkent, 1896. He taught at the seminary from 1894 to 1896. In 1895, Andreev's first ethnographic article was published about the remnants of pagan rites among the indigenous local population. Andreev was a part of the Turkestan Circle of Archaeology Lovers, whom he worked with while writing his publication. With Alexander Polovtsov In 1896, Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov Jr., special assignment officer of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Empire, arrived in Tashkent from St. Petersburg on a mission to study the status of resettlement in Central Asia and the Caucasus. On the recommendation of an expert on the Turkestan Territory, Vladimir Nalivkin, Andreev became Polovtsov's secretary. Andreev accompanied Polovtsov to the Transcaspian and Transcaucasus regions and became a permanent companion and employee of Polovtsov, a person who was not devoid of scientific interests and propensity for patronage. It soon became clear that Polovtsov, who had a reputation for being a sophisticated aesthete, preferred social relations with young men (Andreev in particular, who Polovtsov was very close to) instead of his wife, Sofia Panina, who left Polovtsov and retook her maiden name and original title.Countess Sofia Panina: A Life Filled with Hope State Museum of Applied Arts) As Polovtsov's secretary, Andreev bought a house for him on his behalf in Tashkent from Tashkent merchant Nikolai Ivanovich Ivanov. Andreev restructured the house significantly in an oriental style. The architect of the restructuring was A. A. Burmeyster. The house was known in Tashkent as the \\"Polovtsov House\\". Various organizations operated out of the house, including a training center for ganch carving and embossing as well as an embroidery workshop. Since July 1937, the house housed the Handicraft Museum. Today, the house is the State Museum of Applied Arts of Uzbekistan. With the return of Polovtsov to his permanent residence, Andreev accepted his proposal to move to St. Petersburg, where, in connection with his scientific studies, he entered into live communication with prominent Russian orientalists such as S.F. Oldenburg, V. V. Radlov, and K. G. Zalemanom. These orientalists appreciated Andreev's erudite nature and his devotion to science, particularly his knowledge of the languages and life of the peoples of Central Asia. Andreev spent the winter of 1898 with Polovtsov in Paris, where they learned French. In addition to his official duties, he worked in the Eastern branch of the French National Library. However, even though he traveled and lived in many places, Andreev never broke his ties with Central Asia, and returned many times to live in Tashkent, where he continued to collect linguistic and ethnographic data. In 1902, Andreev drove through Osh to the Pamirs, to Vakhan, Ishkashim and back. The result of the trip was a scientific joint publication with Polovtsov on the ethnography of the Ishkashim and Vakhan tribes. During the trip and during his stay in Tashkent after, Andreev managed to collect data on the Yazgulyam language, which was then extremely obscure and almost unknown. In 1906, Andreev left for India, as Polovtsov was appointed Consul-General in Bombay. The Russian Academy of Sciences instructed him to collect ethnographic data. During his stay in India, he sent a collection of 1000 exhibits to the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography at the Academy of Sciences, as well as sending a report on British intelligence in India to the Governor-General of Turkestan.Officer M.S. Andreev, who was at the Russian consulate in Bombay, upon his return from India, presented to the Turkestan Governor-General a report ‚ÄúOn the British Intelligence Organization in India and Neighboring Countries‚Äù. Andreev believed that in India, British intelligence is divided into 2 types: external and internal. He spoke with great respect about setting up the British intelligence and noted that \\"the Anglo-Indian government does not spare either money or effort.\\" The government skillfully uses information from intelligence agencies about the situation in the country and neighboring states, so that the British are still held in India. In the field of foreign intelligence, according to Andreev, the British, as a rule, used representatives of local tribes or their co- religionists to carry out tasks in Asian states. they belong to representatives of both religions and it‚Äôs easier for agents to hide among them without arousing any suspicion. ‚Äù Andreev established the names of the most successful British intelligence officers who have repeatedly visited Turkestan and who were not disclosed to anyone returned to India ... they belong to representatives of both religions and it‚Äôs easier for agents to hide among them without arousing any suspicion. ‚Äù Andreev established the names of the most successful British intelligence officers who have repeatedly visited Turkestan and who were not disclosed to anyone returned to India ...Grekov N.V.

Andreev In 1907, during a vacation, Andreev again arrived in Central Asia, where he walked on foot with Polovtsov from Kashgar, through the Himalayas, along the Karakorum pass to Western Tibet, and, from there, passing Yarkand, Tashkurgan, Vakhan, Shugnan and East Pamir in the Ferghana Valley. In 1911, he was elected a corresponding member fo the Geographical Society of Bengal. He served as the personal translator of the Consul and Vice-Consul of Russia in India and French Indochina from 1906 to 1914. Upon returning home to Central Asia, Andreev was appointed inspector of public schools in the Khojent and Jizzakh counties of the Samarkand region. The Russian Geographical Society entrusted him with the task of compiling an ethnographic map of the Turkestan Territory, for which he visited the Nur-Ata Mountains and Kyzylkum, which was adjacent to it, as well as going to the Matcha Mountains in 1916.

The October Revolution found Andreev in Khojand. With the establishment of Soviet power in Khojand, Andreev was appointed Commissar of Public Education of the Khojand District. He was then called to Tashkent, where he was entrusted to organize an Oriental university. In November 1918, the Turkestan Oriental Institute opened, lead by Andreev, who was responsible for selecting teachers, organizing facilities, provisioning educational equipment, building a library, organizing archaeological and numismatic collections, as well as many other tasks. Andreev himself taught classes in the Persian language and Tajik on the ethnography of Tajiks. His activity at the Turkestan Oriental Institute and as an assistant professor and professor at the Oriental Department of the First Central Asian State University lasted more than 20 years. He taught at the Eastern faculty of the Central Asian State University through World War II and after it. He was also, for a time, a professor in the Faculty of History, where he was in charge of the Department of Ethnography.Akramova H.F. - In the book: A collection of graduate work of the Department of History of the USSR TSU im.

He was awarded the gold medal of the Russian Geographical Society in 1928. During his years as a professor, Andreev tirelessly organized various expeditions to collect and study ethnographic data and local folklore. His ethnographic collections were received at the Central Asian Central Museum in Tashkent, which was, for a time, headed by him, as well as other museums. In 1921, Andreev was appointed a member of the Scientific Commission for the Survey of the Life of the Indigenous Population of Turkestan under the Council of People's Commissars of the Turkestan ASSR. He led an expedition to compile an ethnographic map of the republic. In the years 1921-1922, the expedition worked in Samarkand, Kattakurgan, Jizzakh and Khojand. In 1923, Andreev visited the headwaters of Chirchik. He visited the Matcha Mountains, Karategin, Gissar and Yaghnob in 1924. In 1925, under his leadership, the expedition operated along the route of Tashkent, Ura-Tyube, the Zarafshan Valley, Yaghnob, Anzob Pass, Dushanbe, Karategin, Darvaz, Pamirye, Pamir, and Osh. The expedition collected rich ethnographic data. Andreev was one out of a group of scientists (I. I. Zarubin, N. G. Mallitsky, L. V. Oshanin, A. A. Semenov, and others) who carried out a great deal of work to collect preparatory materials for the implementation of the national delimitation of the peoples of Central Asia in 1924.In the book: In memory of Mikhail Stepanovich Andreev.

In 1927, Andreev led an expedition to Yaghnob, and in 1929, he led one to theKhuf Valley. On January 31, 1929, Andreev, per the recommendation of prominent Soviet orientalists and academicians S. F.

However, he returned to Tashkent ahead of schedule. In 1934, at the suggestion of the Council of People's Commissars of the Tajik SSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, Andreev carried out an expedition to the Pamir region to replenish previously collected ethnographic and linguistic data in the Khuf Valley and other valleys near it. From the end of 1934 to 1940, Andreev also served as a consultant on the art of the peoples of Central Asia at the Museum of Art in Tashkent. In 1936, he led the Museum's ethnographic and art history expedition to Bukhara and Khiva. In 1937, another museum expedition under him went to the village of Nur-Ata and the city of Margilan. On August 10, 1938, Andreev was arrested and charged with espionage for British intelligence. However, he was released on June 11, 1939. In 1940, Andreev organized an expedition that gathered extensive and diverse materials on the Arch of Old Bukhara. During World War II, Andreev took part in the work of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Tashkent as an employee of the Indian cabinet. He also participated in meetings of the Turkological and Central Asian offices in Tashkent. On November 3, 1943, Andreev was elected a full member of the newly-created Uzbek Academy of Sciences. From 1944 to 1947, Andreev led a team of ethnographers from the Institute of History and Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek SSR. In 1947, he moved to Stalinabad, where he worked on preparing the opening of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography. About 50 of Andreev's works have been published under the Turkestan Circle of Archaeology Lovers, the Society for the Study of Tajikistan and Iranian Nationalities Beyond Its Borders, the Turkestan branch of the Russian Geographical Society and others.

PIJ responded with rocket fire into Israel, including long-range rockets fired towards Tel Aviv, leading to several civilians being wounded. In response to the rocket fire, Israel carried out airstrikes and artillery shelling in the Gaza Strip, killing and wounding several militants as well as civilians. A ceasefire went into effect after 48 hours of clashes, though it was breached by some Palestinian militants.  Background  =Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Baha Abu al-Ata= Palestinian Islamic Jihad is the second-largest militant group in Gaza after Hamas ‚Äì the ruling military and political party. PIJ had financial problems in the year prior to the clashes. The group is funded by Iran, but these funds are reportedly insufficient and the leadership struggles to pay salaries to group members. In 2018 Ziyad al-Nakhalah was appointed leader of PIJ after his predecessor resigned due to bad health. Iran had put pressure on PIJ not to appoint Mohammed al-Hindi as Nakhalah's second-in- command because he wanted the group to form ties with more parties such as Turkey, Qatar and Egypt. Although he was not appointed as a deputy, he is regarded as such. Instead, Akram al-Ajouri, who was also a target of an Israeli attempted assassination on 12 November, was appointed. Within these power struggles in the group, Baha Abu al-Ata, the main target of the Israeli attack, stands out as a separatist. He is the commander of the PIJ's northern sector of the Gaza Strip and held responsible by Israel for rocket attacks on Israel. =Israel‚ÄìHamas talks= The clashes erupted during a time of talks between Israel and Hamas, the military and political leader of the Gaza Strip, on a future settlement to the conflict between the two. In the second half of October 2019, an envoy of the PIJ officials, headed by PIJ leader Al-Nakhalah, was invited to the Egyptian capital to discuss the future calm with Israel. Officials from abroad and from Gaza, including Abu al-Ata, whose killing sparked the November clashes, were invited. Egypt had made attempts to invite members of both the military and political branches of the group, in sight of its internal disputes. The PIJ officials reported that the talks were good and planted roots for further cooperation with Hamas and between both groups and Egypt for the sake of an agreement with Israel. The Egyptian government had made a gesture for the group when it released 25 imprisoned members of the group and let them return to Gaza, a move that was coordinated with Israel. Ten days after the talks the PIJ fired rockets on Israeli communities near Gaza. Hamas and Egypt were angered with this act. This caused disagreements among the Egyptian side on the future of ties with the PIJ. Egypt also threatened to stop the mediation with Israel if Hamas could not restrain the PIJ. Israel held Abu al-Ata responsible for the rocket attacks. =Targeted killing of Baha Abu al-Ata= Before dawn on 12 November, the Israeli Air Force carried out a targeted killing airstrike on Baha Abu al-Ata in Gaza. The airstrike struck the top floor of an apartment building where he was sleeping, killing him and his wife. Two other people were injured. Simultaneously, Syrian state media stated that Israel had fired 3 missiles at a house in Damascus, targeting Akram al-Ajouri. The strikes failed to kill al-Ajouri, but 2 people including his son were killed and 6 others injured. Later that day, Israel confirmed the strike on al-Ata, saying that he was responsible for several attacks on Israel during 2019, including dozens of rocket launches during clashes in May 2019 and sniper attacks on Israeli soldiers. This attack marks a change in Israel's strategic policy against Gaza. In recent years, every time a group other than Hamas attacked Israel, the response was an attack on Hamas, which is held responsible for every attack from Gaza. This time, Israel has attacked the PIJ directly, while avoiding any attack on Hamas. Immediately following the initial attacks, the Israeli public was set under lockdown by the Home Front Command more widespread than anything seen since the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War. Citizens from the Southern and Central Israel were told to refrain from all congregation, to stay home from all workplaces deemed 'not critical' and in addition, all schools and universities were closed until further notice.  Timeline  =12 November= Rocket fire began shortly after the targeted killings of PIJ leaders in Gaza and Syria. The rocket fire was retaliated by Israeli airstrikes and artillery shelling on Gaza. At the end of the day the IDF said it had carried out 20 airstrikes and 10 artillery shelling as a response to about 200 rockets fired from Gaza. According to IDF 90% of the rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system. Magen David Adom had treated 46 people, most of whom were wounded while running for shelter or of shock. Throughout the day, seeing how the backlash from Gaza was far lighter than anticipated, the restrictions set in place for the public, were slowly rolled back and people went back to work/school in the Center of Israel. In the South of Israel, rocket fire continued into the night. During the day at al-Ata's funeral, senior Islamic Jihad official Khaled al-Batsh labeled the two Israeli strikes in Gaza and Syria a \\"declaration of war\\", and vowed that the group's response would \\"rock the Zionist entity\\". Hamas stated that the killing of al-Ata would not go unpunished. =13 November= After six hours without any attacks from both sides between Tuesday and Wednesday, rocket fire from Gaza resumed with a morning barrage that reached Netivot in the south and Beit Shemesh in central Israel. The rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome system. In one of the attacks, the IAF attacked a Palestinian rocket squad. The Palestinians reported that two people were killed and two injured in this attack. Among the sites hit by the IAF were rocket caches and a PIJ training base in Gaza City, which also housed a factory for rocket parts, the IDF claimed. The number of killed by IAF strikes in Gaza rose to 26 on this day. The IDF claimed that out of the first 24 Gazans who got killed, 20 were terrorists. The IDF provided names and pictures of only nine of them. Among those killed in Israeli airstrikes are a PIJ field commander and a Palestinian father and two of his sons. As a result of the fighting, the Friday Palestinian riots on the Gaza border were canceled. By night, over 400 rockets were reportedly fired from Gaza on Israel since the beginning of the hostilities. 60% of the rockets hit open fields, while the IDF said the Iron Dome defense system has had a success rate of 90% against rockets that were projected to hit populated areas. Most of the rockets fired that day were aimed at the Israeli communities in the vicinity of Gaza, with a few reaching Ashdod, some 25 kilometers north of Gaza, and further. The PIJ spokesman Abu Hamza has claimed the group had hit sensitive Israeli military sites, a fact being censored by Israel, according to his account. He also claimed that Israel censored the damage caused to factories, headquarters, civilian houses in Gaza's vicinity and urban areas. Israeli media has released several pictures and videos of direct hits in Israeli communities. In a statement given by PIJ leader al-Nakhalah, he did not mention any military sites that were hit, and said that despite the minor damage caused to the cities, the message was delivered, as many cities in Israel were \\"shut down\\" by the sirens. At noon, a PIJ official stated that the group is not interested in a discussing a ceasefire with Israel at the moment and will only do so after the \\"message\\" to Israel is delivered. As the firing continued, PIJ leader Ziad al- Nakhalah headed to Cairo in the evening to discuss ceasefire attempts with the Egyptians. United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nickolay Mladenov, also arrived at Cairo that night. An Israeli official had confirmed that talks are being held between Israel and the PIJ. Al-Nakhalah detailed the PIJ terms for a ceasefire in an interview to the Lebanese Al Mayadeen TV channel. He demanded Israel to take measures to ease the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, stop the targeted killings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and stop using live ammunition against violent protesters on the border fence with Gaza. Few hours after the interview was aired, a rocket barage from Gaza has reached the city of Rehovot, some 25 kilometers from Tel Aviv. The IAF attacked a PIJ naval base near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip in retaliation. Israeli sources claimed that the PIJ was trying to create a false impression of achievements. As rocket attacks continued in southern Israel by midnight, 8 people were killed in an Israeli attack in Deir al-Balah. Palestinian sources stated that among them were two women and five youth, all civilians. = 14 November = On 14 November PIJ said an Egyptian- brokered ceasefire with Israel had been agreed. The truce was in force from 5:30am local time (03:30 GMT), according to PIJ's spokesman, Musab al-Braim. He claimed that \\"Israel has surrendered to the conditions of the resistance\\". Despite these statements, less than an hour after the truce officially began a rocket barage was fired Israeli communities in the Gaza vicinity. Later, rockets were fired at Ashkelon and Netivot, where a shrapnel fell near a kindergarten. As the rocket attacks and air strikes ended, Israel has gradually lifted all of the security restrictions on its citizens until all communities were allowed to go back to normal life at noon. Later in the day, the truce was violated by Palestinian Islamic Jihad four times, leading the IDF to respond by striking Rafah.  Casualties and damage  A total of 34 people were killed in Gaza during the 48 hours of clashes. According to Israel 25 of them were militants. The Palestinian Labour Minister in Gaza estimated the damage caused by Israel's attacks at half a million US Dollars. The IDF has reported that 450 rockets were fired from Gaza since the beginning of the clashes before dawn on 12 November.

Career as a referee and controversies Chaibou gained the FIFA international badge in 1996 and continued with such distinction until his retirement in 2011. In a friendly match for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Chaibou infamously awarded three penalties to South Africa in the game against Guatemala. In 2011, in another friendly match between Argentina and Nigeria, Chaibou awarded two controversial penalties; one for each side and extended the match for a further twelve minutes after the mandatory time of ninety minutes. The anti- corruption body of FIFA launched an investigation into his performances and tried to track him down but never succeeded. FIFA decided, in January 2019, to ban him for life in any football-linked activities and fined him ¬£154,104 after finding him guilty of bribery and corruption, with a FIFA official saying Chaibou \\"was probably the most corrupt referee the game of football has seen,\\". During a phone interview from his hometown of Niamey, capital of Niger, Chaibou denied the accusations and told the press that FIFA had already spoken with him and that he judged penalties to be penalties and that he did not receive bribes. However, he clarified that he had retired from the sport. After a series of questions regarding match fixing and knowing or not a certain person involved in bribery cases, Chaibou hung up the phone and did not answer any further calls from journalists. Although FIFA has repeatedly called him to present himself for inquiry, he has never left his native country since then and has become a member of the military of Niger.

Rebellion.  Early life and education  Thomas Penick was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He was raised Baptist, but attended St. Aloysius Catholic School in Cleveland, Ohio where he ranked in the top half of the top 1% of all Catholic Schools in the nation. He attributed his academic success to \\"just reading everything in sight\\". Penick enjoyed sports and was a part of the 400-yard relay, football team, and basketball team at St. Aloysius. After middle school, Penick's family moved to California where he attended Los Angeles High School. Thomas had five siblings growing up, but that number increased to six when his cousin was sent out to California to live with his family. His mom had a ton of different jobs during his childhood such as being a nurse's aide, a licensed vocational nurse, a practical nurse, and then a registered nurse. Penick's father was a paratrooper who trained troops for the Korean War, and was described by Penick to be a \\"real tough guy\\". Thomas attended UCLA where he studied screenwriting and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Theater Arts/Motion Pictures.  Career  In addition to writing his first book entitled \\"Yes... 1st Book of Poetry\\", Penick was involved in the making of a number of influential movies and films. In addition to working in the film industry, he also was a poet and contributed to numerous newsletters. First, Thomas directed the short film 69 Pickup (1969) for his UCLA Project One film. 69 Pickup is about two African- American men who pick up a white woman and then rob, beat, and sexually assault her. Penick reportedly made the film after becoming angry as a result of a breakup with his girlfriend at the time. He also made two more short films entitled 49 Pickup and 29 Pickup. After that, he went to work under an Oscar-award winning editor Michael Kahn on the TV pilot \\"Fuzz Brothers\\" (1973), in addition to the films The Spook Who Sat By the Door (1973) and Nightmare Circus (1974). Thomas went on to work for Paramount Pictures, where he served as an assistant editor on the Gordon Parks film Leadbelly (1976). Also working for Warner Bros., Thomas Penick worked as an assistant editor on Ken Russell's Altered States (1981). While attending UCLA, he befriended and worked alongside directors and fellow peers such as Jamaa Fanaka and Charles Burnett, in addition to helping them as a production manager and editor on My Brother's Wedding (1983). Penick wrote a book about Charles Burnett entitled Theefus, and also briefly worked on Burnett's work Killer of Sheep. Other works Penick worked on include Lady Sings the Blues (1972) and American Playhouse (1982). Alongside his fellow UCLA peers, Thomas was involved in the L.A. Rebellion film movement. Finally, he worked as an assistant film editor on a number of television series and trailers for MGM, including the miniseries \\"George Washington\\" (1984).  Additional information  Penick achieved the fastest reading-time while attending St. Aloysius by first familiarizing himself with the weight of a book, and then using his unique ability to understand what is being said without reading word-for-word. His childhood nickname was \\"Bright Eyes\\" because he was said to be good at finding things and remembering where things are, even though he had bad eyesight. Penick originally wanted to attend Harvard University to become an attorney, and even though he wasn't too keen of UCLA, he ended up following in his older brother Clifford's footsteps and attended UCLA. Although his father was a paratrooper, the father couldn't stand the increasingly cold weather in Cleveland, Ohio, and decided to move the family to California where the weather is warmer. When given the choice via an academic counselor of either going to summer school at UCLA to bring up his grades or take a trip to West Africa, Penick decided, \\"Well, I'm going to West Africa\\".

Early life Mack was born in Price Hill, Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended the Mother of Mercy High School, graduating in 1947. She then worked as a human mannequin in a department store window in Cincinnati, and as a salesperson, before being employed as a record librarian at WCPO-AM radio in March 1949. Career Mack appeared in Paul Dixon's radio show. When WCPO-TV started in July 1949, she transferred to the Paul Dixon's Song Shop on television, performing with Dixon and Wanda Lewis. She lip-synched to songs by singers including Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Dinah Shore, Patti Page, and Eartha Kitt. She was known as the \\"Queen of Pantomime\\" for \\"her striking beauty and seemingly innate ability to pantomime expertly any type of song.\\" She was so popular that she was given her own show, first Your Pantomime Hit Parade, then a 15-minute show called Girl Alone, and finally a half-hour program called The Dotty Mack Show, in which she was joined by Bob Braun and Colin Male. ABC and the DuMont Television Network screened the Dotty Mack Show nationally from 1953 to 1956. By 1955, a Dotty Mack fan club existed in Cincinnati. TV host Faye Emerson said of her show in 1954, she is \\"extremely talented ... She can be cute as a kitten's ear, romantic as rose petals, or sultry as absinthe ... She is a good actress and her sense of timing is nothing short of miraculous.\\" However, Emerson wrote, she \\"would still rather see Rosemary Clooney singing her own songs\\" than \\"pretty little parrots like Dotty Mack and her friends.\\" She sometimes had enquiries for singing from people who did not know that she was principally a mime. She was noted for her beautiful gowns on the air; however, there was no clothing allowance, so they were all hers. Personal life Mack went out with Dick Van Dyke, Frank Sinatra and Joe DiMaggio. She married William B. Williams who was a disc jockey in New York in 1960. In 1961 her son Jeffrey, was born and she became a full time mother, but she still mixed socially with Doris Day, Rosemary Clooney, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. She moved to Miami, Florida after her husband died in 1986, where she died on November 11, 2019.

It is located in a forest near the village of Palmiry (Czosn√≥w) within the Kampinos National Park in the Masovian Voivodeship. During the German occupation of Poland between 1939 and 1943, the Gestapo and SS units carried out secret mass shootings of the Polish civilian population here. The memorial is located near the former mass graves.  History  Transport of prisoners to the Palmiry shooting site in 1940, recorded by the Polish underground movement. Before the Second World War, ammunition was stored here, which is why the local population called the area \\"Po wybuchu\\" (powder keg). These camps, originally part of the Modlin fortress, supplied ammunition to the Polish defence forces during the siege of Warsaw in September 1939. The ammunition depot was equipped with a railway connection. In the first months of occupation, the facility, including the tracks, were dismantled by German units. The surrounding forest was cleared. A clearing was created which was to become a secret place of execution. Shootings were carried out here for the first time on 14 December 1939. The executions in Palmiry were carefully planned by the Gestapo deployed in Warsaw. A few days before the transport, a department of the Reich Labour Service, located in nearby ≈Åomna, sometimes also units of the Hitler Youth camping near Palmiry, excavated pits suitable for mass graves in the clearing. These pits were about 2.5 m deep and 30 m long. The victims to be shot were usually taken from the Warsaw Pawiak prison, and rarely from the Mokot√≥w prison in Rakowiecka Street on trucks to Palmiry. Most of the Poles murdered here belonged to the Polish Inteligencja. The climax of the shootings was reached within the framework of the Poland-wide AB Actions. The prisoners were allowed to take their personal belongings with them ‚Äì allowing them to be reassured, and later on these objects helped with the identification. Upon arrival at the execution site, they had to line up in front of the pits and were shot with machine guns. The filled pits were planted with pines. In spite of the extensive cordoning off of the site and the highest level of secrecy, the Polish underground movement knew of the massacres taking place near Palmiry as early as winter 1939. Polish forest workers were able to document the events and mark the mass graves. Under the forester Adam Herba≈Ñski, trees were marked at night which later helped to find the graves again later. From 25 November 1945 to autumn 1946 the Polish Red Cross carried out the exhumation of the bodies in the presence of representatives of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland. 24 mass graves were found in an area of 1.5 km¬≤. The total number of victims shot and buried at Palmiry is not exactly known. Depending on the sources, there were between 2,115 (exhumed) and 2,255 persons, many of them of Jewish descent. About 20 % were women. Among those murdered here were Olympic medal winners Janusz Kusoci≈Ñski and Tomasz Stankiewicz, chess master Dawid Przepi√≥rka, university professors Stefan Kopeƒá and Kazimierz Zakrzewski, politicians Henryk Brun, Helena Jaroszewicz, Mieczys≈Çaw Niedzia≈Çkowski, Stanis≈Çaw Piasecki, Maciej Rataj (Sejmmarschall) as well as mayors Miko≈Çaj Bo≈ºym, Adolf Kutkowski, Mieczys≈Çaw Markowski and Jan Pohoski.  Memorial today  The exhumed corpses were buried in a new cemetery near the mass graves. Today, this cemetery forms the core of the Palmiry memorial, which has existed since 1948. In 1973 the Museum of Struggle and Martyrdom (Polish: \\"Muzeum Walki i Mƒôcze≈Ñstwa\\") was opened here, where documents and artifacts from the exhumation but also the activities of the Polish underground movement in the area are exhibited. This museum has been under the control of the Warsaw Museum since 1980. On 9 July 2004, a storm caused considerable damage to the trees of the entire complex, which could only be repaired by soldiers of the Warsaw garrison in spring 2005. In 2009, a competition for the construction of a new museum building was announced. German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der visited the memorial site during his visit to Warsaw in 1999 and laid a wreath there. In the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., a Palmiry tree stump was used as a design element.

He completed the painting in 1962 as a wider series on Coca-Cola paintings, which also included Green Coca-Cola Bottles and Coca-Cola (4). The painting and others in the series are considered founding paintings of the pop art movement. The painting is a 6-foot, black and white painting of a Coca-Cola bottle from the era. Ownership In 2013, it was announced that the artwork would be put up for sale by the Mugrabi family, one of the largest collectors of Andy Warhol art. They had bought the painting two decades earlier, rumored to be from a billionaire collector. It was sold by the Mugrabi family for $57.3 million USD at Christie's in 2013. The current owner of the painting is not listed.  Origin & Painting  Warhol is best known for his famous Campbells soup cans which was completed around the same time as Coca-Cola(3), between 1961 and 1962. Campbell‚Äôs soup cans share the idea of the commercial culture of Warhol‚Äôs Coca-Cola series. Warhol first began working with Coca-Cola bottles in the early 1950s when he would use images of Coke bottles from magazines to create collages. Warhol had a unique perspective and interest on coke bottles. Warhol would state that ‚ÄúA Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke.‚Äù, alluding to the idea of economic and political equality. Some of his most famous works focus on mass-produced items, such as soup cans and coke bottles, products that consistently remained the same quality, no matter how much you paid for it. Warhol was attracted to the idea that no matter who you are, you cannot purchase a better coke or can of soup than the next person. Ultimately, Warhol admired the uniformity of items such as soup cans and coke bottles. Warhol‚Äôs first Stable show featured three known serial works of one hundred soups cans, one hundred dollar bills and one hundred coke bottles. Between 1960 and 1960 Warhol created two versions of Coca-Cola (3). They were very similar to each other, however, one featured a large dark splotch on the top right corner of the canvas. In his career, Warhol created 15 pieces associated to Coca-Cola.

In the United States, the order is best known for its missions to the Native Americans in the early 17th century, its network of colleges and universities, and (in Europe before 1773) its politically conservative role in the Catholic Counter Reformation. Missions to the Indians Most of the Jesuit missions to North America were located in today's Canada, but they explored and mapped much of the west.Allan Greer, ed. The Jesuit relations: natives and missionaries in seventeenth-century North America (2000).Nicholas P. Cushner, Why have you come here?: the Jesuits and the first evangelization of native America (Oxford UP, 2006). French missionaries P√®re Marquette and Louis Jolliet were the first Europeans to explore and chart the northern portion of the Mississippi River, as far as the Illinois River.Reuben Gold Thwaites, Father Marquette (1902). Peter De Smet was a Belgian Jesuit active in missionary work among the Plains Indians in the mid-19th century. His extensive travels as a missionary were said to total 180,000 miles. He was known as the \\"Friend of Sitting Bull\\" because he persuaded the Sioux war chief to participate in negotiations with the United States government for the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. History It was a crime for Jesuits to enter colonial Massachusetts, but none were known to be present there. There were about two dozen Jesuits in the Thirteen Colonies in 1760, and they kept a low profile.Kathleen A. Mahoney, Catholic Higher Education in Protestant America: The Jesuits and Harvard in the Age of the University (2003) p 47/ Former Jesuit John Carroll (1735‚Äì1815) became the first Catholic bishop in the young republic. He founded Georgetown University in 1789, and it remains a pre-eminent Jesuit school.Robert Emmett Curran, The Bicentennial History of Georgetown University: From Academy to University 1789‚Äì1889 (Georgetown UP, 1993). Stephen Larigaudelle Dubuisson, S.J. (1786‚Äì1864) was sent by the Jesuits from France to the United States in 1816‚Äì1826. He served in several parishes and colleges in the Maryland- Pennsylvania area, the center of Catholicism in the new nation. He was not a success as the head of Georgetown College, but otherwise was highly energetic and generally successful. In 1826 he was recalled to Rome, where he became effectively in charge of all Jesuits in the United States, as the advisor on American affairs to the head of the Society. He handled fund-raising, appointments, and setting general policies.Cornelius Michael Buckley, Stephen Larigaudelle Dubuisson, S.J. (1786‚Äì1864) and the Reform of the American Jesuits. (2013) The American Jesuits were restored in 1804, and intellectually reflected the English Enlightenment, emphasizing reasonableness of faith, the right of individual conscience, private devotion, and active participation in the political life of the Republic. In Europe, by contract, the Jesuits were restored in 1814, as part of the Bourbon reaction against the French Revolution. The restored order \\"resisted intellectual innovation, distrusted Republicanism, championed papal primacy, clung to the throne/altar alliance, and promoted a Baroque piety that was 'warm, emotional, colorful and ardent.'\\"Marianne Gallagher, \\"The Jesuits at Boston College in the Late Nineteenth Century,\\" American Catholic Studies (2007) 118#2 pp. 43‚Äì66 online quote on p 45; she took the 'warm' quote from Owen Chadwick, Secularization and the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century (1975) pp. 117‚Äì118. The European and American models were incompatible, and a flood of European Jesuits overwhelmed the new nation and established its conservative policies. In 1864, they wholeheartedly adopted the \\"Syllabus of Errors\\" an encyclical from Pope Pius IX that named 80 specific modern liberal ideas that Catholics were forbidden to teach or believe in. The Jesuits were quite successful in establishing staffing, funding and enrolling students for a growing network of secondary and collegiate schools. As the Irish and German ethnic middle classes became better established, they sent their boys off to Jesuit schools. The main goals of the Jesuit education were to inculcate piety, loyalty to the church, and strict adherence to the rules. The chief intellectual pursuit was Thomistic philosophy. Catholic students were not allowed to attend lectures given by non-Catholics.Gallagher, pp 43-45. As late as the 1950s, Catholic writers such as John Tracy Ellis were bemoaning The intellectual weakness of the Catholic community. The late 19th century, the reform element emerged among Catholics, led by Archbishop John Ireland, that was Strongly opposed by conservative elements, led by the Jesuits. One battle involved creation of the Catholic University of America, in Washington, which would compete directly with the nearby Jesuit school Georgetown University. The dispute lasted for decades, and weakened both schools.Vincent J. Gorman, \\"Georgetown University: The Early Relationship with the Catholic University of America 1884-1907.\\" Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia 102#3 (1991): 13-31. online  Provinces  The Society of Jesus is organized into geographic provinces, each of which being headed by a provincial superior. Today, there are four Jesuit provinces operating in the United States: the USA East, USA Central and Southern, USA Midwest, and USA West Provinces. At their height, there were ten provinces. Though there had been mergers in the past, a major reorganization of the provinces began in early 21st century, with the aim of consolidating into four provinces by 2020. The Jesuit provinces were first organized into an \\"assistancy\\" (a regional grouping of provinces), called the Jesuit Conference of the United States, in 1972. A new, consolidated assistancy was created in 2014, called the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, under which all the provinces in the two countries are organized. = USA East = The Jesuit mission in the United States dated back to 1634. However, it was not until 1833 that the first province in the United States was established: the Maryland Province. William McSherry was elected as the first provincial superior, whose territory included the entire United States except for the territory of the Missouri mission. In 1879, the Maryland Province assumed responsibility for the New York portion of the New York-Canada mission, which gave rise to the new Maryland-New York Province. From the Maryland-New York Province was separated the New England Province in 1926. The New England Province administered a mission in Iraq, Jamaica, and Jordan. In 1943, the Maryland-New York Province was once again split into the Maryland Province and the New York Province, whose territory included all of New York State and northern New Jersey. From the New York Province, the Buffalo Province was created in 1960, whose territory included Upstate New York; due to a decline in the number of vocations, the Buffalo Province was merged back into the New York Province in 1969. The New York Province also administered missions in the Philippines, Micronesia, and Nigeria-Ghana. In 2014, the New York Province and the New England Province merged to form the USA Northeast Province, whose territory spanned from New Jersey to Maine. Its membership included 550 Jesuits, making it the largest Jesuit province in the world at the time. In 2019, it was announced that the Maryland Province and the USA Northeast Province would be merged to form the USA East Province in mid-2020, whose territory will span from Maine to Georgia. = USA Central and Southern = The first Jesuits entered Louisiana in the early 18th century, making New Orleans the headquarters of the French Jesuit mission in the Southern United States, which disbanded with the suppression of the Society. The first province in the South was established in 1863: the Missouri Province, whose origins dated to 1840 as a vice-province and 1823 as a mission. Out of the territory of the Missouri Province was created the New Orleans Province in 1907, whose territory included Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Texas. In 2014, the Missouri Province and the New Orleans Provinces were once again reunited as the USA Central and Southern Province. = USA Midwest = The Chicago Province was created out of the Missouri Province in 1928. It also administered missions in India, Nepal, and Peru. The Detroit Province was separated from the Chicago Province in 1955. The Wisconsin Province was also created out of the Chicago Province that year. The Chicago and Detroit Provinces merged back together in 2011 as the Chicago-Detroit Province. The Chicago-Detroit and Wisconsin Provinces were merged in 2017 to become the USA Midwest Province. = USA West = The California Province was established in 1909. The Oregon Province was created out of the California Province in 1932. The two re-united in 2017 as the USA West Province.

It was the end phase of the so-called Calvinist Republic of Ghent, which had controlled most of the County of Flanders since radical Protestants seized power on 28 October 1577, claiming a leading role for the city of Ghent in the struggle against the Spanish royal forces and Malcontent Catholics.  Background  Hembyze. Throughout its existence, the Calvinist Republic of Ghent (1577‚Äì1584) was riddled with internal strife between the factions surrounding the intolerant radical Calvinist Jan van Hembyze and the more moderate, Orangist (that is, sympathising with William the Silent, Prince of Orange) Fran√ßois van der Kethulle, lord of Ryhove, while Spanish and Malcontent troops made increasing territorial gains since 1578 and reconquered one place after the other. In 1579, Hembyze first banned Ryhove, then Ryhove had Hembyze removed from the city with Orange's help. Ryhove continued the moderate policy of Orange, and tried to cooperate as much as possible with the Calvinist Republic of Antwerp (1577‚Äì1585) and the States of Brabant.

Hembyze and Pieter Datheen were forced into commencing secret negotiations with Parma on 5 March, but they were exposed. Hembyze was arrested on 23 March, and beheaded on 4 August on Saint Pharaildis Square,Vander Schelden, p. 73. while Datheen was imprisoned. Meanwhile, William of Orange was assassinated on 10 July 1584 in Delft, leaving the Dutch Revolt without both its radical and its moderate leaders.

Catholicism was restored as the official religion, while about 15,000 inhabitants voluntarily or forcibly abandoned the city, including thousands of Calvinists who primarily migrated to Holland., 1585: de val van Antwerpen en de uittocht van Vlamingen en Brabanders (Lannoo, 2004), p. 41. By 1600, the population of Ghent had shrunk from 50,000 (before the Revolt) to 31,000 inhabitants., De republiek: 1477-1806 (2001) 455. Franeker: Van Wijnen. With the except of Ostend, the Revolt was over in Flanders, and by the time Maurice of Nassau conducted his campaign towards Dunkirk, leading to the Battle of Nieuwpoort (1600), the Flemish populace did not support him. At the conclusion of the Siege of Ostend in 1604, the emerging Dutch Republic lost its last major Flemish city. Only a small northern coastal strip would eventually remain in Dutch possession when the Peace of M√ºnster was concluded in 1648; this region was known as Staats-Vlaanderen, which largely corresponds to modern Zeelandic Flanders (Zeeuws-Vlaanderen), the only part of the former County of Flanders that still has a substantial Protestant population.

The book was first published in paperback by Avon Books. Plot Set in 1965, Dean Howell is disfigured and left in a vegetative stage after a shooting accident while training in the army. His wife Sarah and mother Jo bring him home to care for him. Jo blames many of the residents of their small town of Pinecone, Alabama, starting with the rifle's manufacturers, who are the largest company in the area. During a visit by an old friend, Jo gifts him an amulet that she claims her son wanted him to have. That evening the friend's family is killed in a house fire. The amulet is discovered among the smoldering ruins of the house by the sheriff's daughter who brings the amulet home and gives it to her mother. That night, the mother kills her husband with an ice pick and accidentally cuts her own throat. The amulet then makes its way through those who Jo accuses of responsibility for Dean's accident. Sarah is the only one who sees what might be the cause of these accidents, and along with her close friend Becca, the two set out to find the amulet before any more lives are ruined by its curse. Overview McDowell moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1968, to attend Harvard and, planned on becoming an English teacher. He continued writing at night. After dropping out of Brandeis's PhD program when he realized he didn't want to teach, McDowell found work as a secretary while writing on the side. He ended up writing six novels, all of which were rejected by publishers. Then in 1977, he went to go see Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, where he saw a trailer for The Omen and began to fixate on the main character's name. \\"I thought, \\"well, isn't it convenient that these possessed children have such diabolical names? What if you had a possessed child called Fred?\\" McDowell began writing a screenplay with this idea, which he later adapted into a novel, assuming that anyone who produced the film would want to have a novelization to go along with the film. \\"Before I started, I knew that I was going to have a sequence of deaths, and that the amulet would pass from one to another. Beyond that, I didn't know what I was going to do, so a friend and I sat down one evening and thought: 'How can you kill people with things around the house?' We came up with an ice pick in the ear, and throwing a baby into a washing machine, and decapitation by a ceiling fan and so on. So I wrote those down and then I figured out ways to connect them.\\" Avon Books was the first publisher to see the manuscript and they bought it, signing McDowell to a two-book contract. This deal allowed McDowell to quit his secretarial job and focus on writing full time. In an interview with Douglas Winter in his book Faces of Fear, McDowell said, \\"I like being published in paperback. That's important to me.\\" Reception The Amulet was well received. The Los Angeles Review of Books said of it, \\"The Amulet is an impressive debut. It shows McDowell‚Äôs prowess for sharp dialogue, which minds the natural and regional (if not always strictly individual) cadences and humor of his characters.\\" The Washington Post said, \\"McDowell has a flair for the gruesome.\\" Grady Hendrix praised McDowell's writing and storytelling skill, saying, \\"The book ends with a supernatural melt-down that's an orgy of gore but if that was all there was to The Amulet this would be little more than a forgettable Final Destination fiesta. But McDowell has written a book that feels, deeply, like Alabama in the Sixties. This is a Southern book that captures mid-century small town living in a way few books do.\\" The book was republished by Valancourt Books in 2013, with a new introduction by Poppy Z. Brite, who called McDowell, \\"One of the genre‚Äôs most underrated writers...enjoyably nasty.\\" References Category:1979 American novels Category:American horror novels ","title":"The Amulet (novel)"},{"id":"62322628","text":"Fetuli Paea (born 16 August 1994 in Tonga) is an Tongan rugby union player who plays for the in Super Rugby and in the Mitre 10 Cup.

The tree became associated with the Scottish independence leader William Wallace. Its hollow trunk is reputed to have served him as a headquarters, hiding place and sleeping quarters. By the 17th-century the tree was being used to make souvenirs due to its association with Wallace. By 1830 it was described as badly affected by the removal of timber, being reduced to a single stump. Timber being scarce above ground its roots were also dug up for souvenirs and the tree was dead by 1835.  Association with Wallace  The tree stood in the ancient forest of Torwood and is reputed to have been the focus of druidic worship in ancient times. The writer John Donald Carrick in the early 19th-century described the tree as having \\"greater antiquity\\" than any tree he had seen in Scotland. The tree stood on a raised platform in an area of clayey swamp land (known as carse in Scotland); the platform was originally in diameter but had decayed by the 1800s. The tree is known as the \\"Wallace Oak\\", \\"Wallace's Tree\\" and \\"Wallace's Oak\\" for its association with 13th & 14th-century Scottish independence leader William Wallace. Wallace is said to have retreated to the Torwood after a defeat in the north of the country and hidden within its hollow trunk. The tree is then said to have become the headquarters of Wallace, who used the nearby wood to hide his troops, for a number of years. Wallace is said to have slept within the trunk of the tree which was large enough to accommodate him and several of his officers and addressed his men when they assembled beneath its canaopy. The tree at this point is reputed to have been of great size, being described as the largest tree ever to have grown in Scotland and able to provide shade for a thousand men. In the early 19th-century an old spear point was found some west of the oak, at depth. The spear point was dated to 1488, when James III of Scotland fought rebel nobles in the Torwood, or possibly even earlier. Torwood Castle was built near the location of the Wallace Oak in the 16th- century.  Decline and loss  Blasted Oak by John Thomson The tree has long been targeted by souvenir hunters. The earliest known such relic is a silver- rimmed quaich (drinking cup) of 1689; this came into the possession of Charles Cochrane-Baillie, 2nd Baron Lamington and was displayed at the Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry in 1911 but has since disappeared. In 1771 the trunk of the Wallace Oak was measured at in circumference. In the same year it was drawn by Alexander Nasmyth who described it as much depleted, being reduce to little more than two stumps. David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan removed a section of wood from the Wallace Oak in 1782. He had this made into a snuff box that was presented to US president George Washington in 1791 as a token intended to demonstrate that American democratic practices had their roots in Wallace's actions. The oak itself was described as \\"wholly decayed and hollow\\" by 1791. Another quaich was made from wood of the Wallace Oak in 1795. This carries the inscription: \\"This cup is part of the oak tree in the Torwood which was often an asylum to the immortal Wallace. Drink of this and mark the footsteps of a hero\\". The tree was painted by John Thomson of Duddingston in the early 1800s. By this time it was merely a single stump and the painting was entitled by Thomson as the Blasted Oak. A snuffbox was made from some of the remaining timber in 1822 and presented to King George IV. In early 1830 it was described as still sanding standing on a raised platform in a mossy area of swampland, though badly affected by the removal of timber. The stump stood at just in height, though it had sprouted new growth towards the top of this section. There were no other trees nearby, these having been cleared, and the oak stood near to a corduroy road. With the timber above ground growing in short supply the souvenir hunters turned to digging up the platform to get to the tree's roots. The tree was dead by 1835. By 1877 only a few fragments of the trunk remained, but were said to be soon to disappear as they were being gathered as souvenirs. By 1881 the site of the tree lay from the edge of the Torwood, which had been subject to tree felling and land clearance.

It is linked in legend to the Scottish independence leader William Wallace who is said to have been chained to the tree in 1304/05 after his capture by English forces. The tree was starting to decay by the 18th century and was treated with pitch. It also had chains added to strengthen its branches, which may be the origin of the Wallace myth. The tree fell during a storm in 1995 but some of its timber has been preserved. A proposal was made in 2019 to erect a monument to the tree.  Connection with Wallace  The tree stood near the present-day location of the Holy Family Roman Catholic Church on Parkhill Avenue in Port Glasgow. The tree is linked to a legend associated with Scottish independence leader William Wallace. Scottish historian David R. Ross stated in his 1998 work On the Trail of William Wallace that Wallace was captured by the English at Robroyston, near Glasgow and brought across the River Clyde by the ferry at Port Glasgow. He was held in the village for a period whilst troops were assembled to escort him to London for trial. It is said that Wallace was chained to the oak tree during this time. Reliable information about Wallace's movements between Autumn 1304 and his execution on 23 August 1305 is scarce and it is thought that legends have sprung up to fill the gaps. However the story of the Wallace Oak at Port Glasgow has a particularly long history. The chains are said to have been left on the tree after Wallace was removed. Local children are reported to have painted the chains red each year to symbolise the blood shed by Wallace in the cause of Scottish independence and the chains replaced each time they rusted away over the years. An alternative version of the story states that Wallace escaped from the English who had cornered him at Elderslie. He is then said to have fled to Port Glasgow and evaded English patrols by hiding in the branches of the Wallace Oak.  Recent history  The tree was starting to decay by 1768; William Cunningham, 13th Earl of Glencairn ordered the affected portion cut away and the wound filled with boiling pitch. Cunningham is also said to have added chains to the tree to strengthen its branches, which may well be the origin of the chained Wallace myth. The chains were subsequently partially encapsulated by the tree as it grew. Some of the surviving chain has been dated to the late-19th or early-20th centuries. In 1962 the tree was the subject of an article in the Greenock Telegraph which described efforts to save it. Despite this the tree fell during a storm in 1995. Some of the remains were taken to the nearby Gourock Ropeworks yard for safekeeping and some left in situ. A dendrochronological analysis of some of the remaining timber dated it to 1786. It is thought that this segment would have been from approximately 2 metres above ground level, which would date the start of the growth to around 1762. it is possible that this section was from regrowth stimulated by Cunnigham's intervention in 1768. An analysis of older sections of the trunk could not be carried out but may well be several hundred years earlier. In October 2019 planning permission was applied for to construct a monument to the oak in the grounds of the church. Designed by the local firm Nicholson McShane Architects, it would comprise a granite representation of a split tree trunk with a metal chain around its base.

It stands on grassland said to be near the home of medieval Scottish leader William Wallace. In legend Wallace is said to have hidden in its branches to escape an English patrol. The tree is noted in parish records as early as the 18th century and still stands in 2019. In more recent times it has been damaged by fire and storms and is now dying of a Ganoderma fungus infection. The Renfrewshire Council has taken cuttings of the tree to be grown as a replacement.  History  The Wallace Yew is said to date back to the time of medieval Scottish independence leader William Wallace and to have been planted by him. This would make the tree some 700 years old. Doubts have been raised about the 700-year claim, though parish records from the 1700s record the presence of the yew which is described as \\"this ancient tree\\". The tree stands on a patch of grassland which is said to be near the site of Wallace's home and birthplace. In legend the tree is said to have sheltered Wallace from a patrol of English soldiers who were searching for him. The tree is described in a book of 1857 as bearing \\"the mark of great age\\", though the writer notes that it was still in good health and \\"supporting a progeny of spreading branches\\". A 1912 work described the Wallace Yew as being more than 600 years old and playing a key role in preserving the association of Wallace's name with the village; this being a period between the felling of the Wallace Oak and the erection of a granite monument to Wallace.  Decline and replacement  Wallace's Yew in 1839 The Wallace Yew was damaged by an arson attack in 1978 and again by storms in 2005. This left the tree open to infection by the untreatable Ganoderma fungus, which took hold by 2008 and will lead to eventual death. A Conservation Foundation campaign to save Scotland's yew trees was launched at the Wallace Yew in 2002 by botanist David Bellamy. The tree, which at one point measured in height, was still standing by 2018. Renfrewshire Council took twelve cuttings from the tree with the intention of growing a replacement - these will all be clones of the original. Six of these cuttings successfully propagated and had reached around in height by 2008. One of the replacement trees, which will take 30 years to reach maturity, will be selected and planted near to the site of the Wallace Yew to replace it. Another tree of the same name stood near to Elcho Castle near Perth.

I had access to the house, and the lady's mother, who played mothers in acting, but badly, often invited me to dinner and gave me sweet looks; only I was a chaste Joseph, because Madame M√ºller was not as charming as Putiphar, and therefore never left my coat there. The daughter would probably have been my own choice, and I also worked on a French comedy for her, which was given under her name under the title \\"Das Liebhabertheater,\\" but it did not bear me any fruit, since she had a love affair with a Russian prince.Ignaz Franz Castelli, Memoiren meines Lebens, volume 1, Vienna-Prague 1861, The aforementioned play Das Liebhabertheater - the translation of a play by Emmanuel Dupaty - premiered on 22 April 1807.

Both the 1996 and 2009 Master Plans of the Town of Dedham have recognized the historic, aesthetic, and economic importance of the building. History The land was acquired in 1819 by George Dixon and he built a home there. In the ell of the house was an apothecary shop that sold products produced by Dedham's Wheaton & Dixon. By the 1880s, the Dedham Institution for Savings, which had been housed for 40 years in the Norfolk Mutual Fire Insurance Company at 4 Pearl Street, determined that they needed additional space and a building of their own. On April 26, 1887, the bank purchased the Phoenix Estate on the corner of High and Washington Streets, the site of the present day Knights of Columbus building, next to the Dixon property. On August 13, 1887, a committee was formed to look into the cost of erecting a building on the site. On February 27, 1890, however, the property was sold and a new committee was appointed to sell this property and to purchase the Marsh lot next door. The new property was purchased on March 18, 1890. On February 14, 1891, plans and cost estimates for a new building were accepted by the bank trustees and construction commenced. On August 22, 1892, the bank moved into their new quarters in the west end of the building. When first opened, the lower level housed the Dedham National Bank and William Hurley's drug store in addition to the Dedham Institution for Savings. The second story housed the newly organized Fisher Ames Club, a men's social club. At the time of its opening, the local newspaper reported that people were lining up at the counter of the bank before the operation had moved down the street. The janitor had to tell them they were not open for business yet. A month later, the same paper reported that \\"the new bank building is a beehive of industry... The building is fitted throughout with the best of furniture and contains every modern convenience.\\" Dedham Savings sold the building on October 22, 1985, although they kept a branch office located in the building until they moved to the other side of Dedham Square in 2007. Since that time, the building has come to be known as the Schortman Insurance Building after its new owner. The building was sold in the summer of 2019 to Mark R. Epker, a resident of Dedham and the principal of Vantage Real Estate. Construction The building was designed by Hartwell & Richardson and built by Darling Brothers of Worcester in the Romanesque Revival style. It was constructed with \\"old gold fire flashed\\" brick with brownstone trimmings. There are three dramatic arches facing the street. The ends of the arches and the braces of the downspouts are accentuated by whimsical brownstone carvings, including entwined dolphins. Along the cornice line are large cast panels of foliate ornament. Above the center arch, in the copper downspout header boxes, the year \\"1892\\" is impressed. It also features high pitched roofs and steep dormers. Since its construction, the building has been remodeled. The two side arches were originally entrances to the two banks and the center arch was a window, but today the center arch is a main entrance to the building and the side arches are windows. The bank is now a lawyer's office, although the vault remains. Within many of the offices the original oak paneling and fireplaces remain.

Serving as an Emeritus research director for Inserm, he works and teaches in molecular genetics and development biology at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure (ENS) in Paris.  Biography  Charnay is a former student of the √âcole Polytechnique (1973 school year). Upon graduation, he turned towards fundamental biology and embarked on a science thesis in Pierre Tiollais' laboratory at the Institut Pasteur. He devoted himself particularly to the research of the cloning and sequencing of the hepatitis B virus genome, as well as to the synthesis of the surface antigen in the bacterium. His research findings paved the way for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against the disease. Charnay was recruited by Inserm in 1980. After obtaining his PhD in 1981, he did a postdoctoral fellowship in Tom Maniatis' laboratory at Harvard University (Cambridge, USA), where he studied the molecular basis for the regulation of globin gene expression. In 1984, he joined the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg (Germany) as a group leader and focused on the study of transcription factors that played a decisive role in establishing the nervous system during development. Since 1989, he has been working in the Biology Department of the ENS, where he continues to study genes that play an important role in the development of the nervous system or its function and regulation. At ENS, Patrick Charnay was Director of an Inserm Unit (1993-2005), Director of the Biology Department (2000-2001 and 2016-2017) and Professor of Biology (2013-2018). He also taught at the √âcole Polytechnique (1997-2010). Charnay has been a member of EMBO since 1995, of the Academia Europaea since 1998 and of the French Academy of Sciences since 2004. During his career, he has participated in (or chaired) numerous scientific committees.  Scientific contributions  Charnay has spent most of his career focusing on the genetic regulatory mechanisms that control the development and function of the central and peripheral nervous system of vertebrates.

The club is formed of five halls where different genres of music are played even though the most played are indie pop, electronic and pop music. Razzmatazz is the \\"evolution\\" of the Sala Zeleste, which closed back in 2000 due to its economic debt with the Social Security.  History  In 1986, the historical Sala Zeleste at Carrer Plater√≠a was closed to open a new and much larger one at the Carrer Almog√†vers in Poblenou. The new Sala Zeleste is located in the space previously occupied by two carpet and stamped factories. Then it maintains the appearance of a factory or loft, with three clear and very large rooms that can reach more than 3,000 people in total. The main hall had a capacity of 2,000 people, which turned Zeleste into one of the few major concert halls in Barcelona (without reaching the macro-concerts that can be done in the stadium, for example) and that therefore It offered the possibility of hosting concerts of highly successful formations.

National Regulatory Research Institute. National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). As of 2019, 17 different states have used multi-year rate plans.  Background  In the United States, electricity rates have traditionally been based on the utility's cost of delivering the electricity to its customers. The utility's overall cost of service (known as the \\"revenue requirement\\") is typically divided among various functions (such as electricity generation, transmission, distribution, etc.). Next, the revenue requirement gets allocated among various customer classes (residential, commercial, etc.). Finally, the rates are assigned to what are known as \\"billing determinants\\" that include charges such as peak power demand and fixed monthly fees.Kirsch, Laurence D.; Mathew J. Morey (2016-05-25). \\"ALTERNATIVE ELECTRICITY RATEMAKING MECHANISMS ADOPTED BY OTHER STATES.\\" Prepared for the Public Utility Commission of Texas by Christensen Associates Energy Consulting LLC. Published by National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC). The largest group of supporters of multi-year rate plans (MRPs) are the utilities themselves. One of the main arguments made by utility companies is that using MRPs makes the regulatory process better and helps the utilities' financial conditions. However, according to the National Regulatory Research Institute run by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), \\"From a regulatory perspective, their arguments seem to fall short of making a compelling case for how their customers would benefit.\\" In 2017, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) issued a report saying that traditional ratemaking based on cost-of-service requires more frequent rate cases, and more frequent rate cases are correlated with lower quality utility productivity and higher customer costs. A 2019 study published in the academic journal Utility Policy said that a multi-year rate plan can be \\". . . more compatible with the public interest\\" as long as the plan is well structured, but that \\"substandard\\" multi-year rate plans \\". . . can produce worse outcomes for utility customers.\\" Other countries, such as Australia, Canada and Great Britain, use MRPs more often than does the United States.  History  In the mid-2000s, after a decade of a favorable business environment, American utility companies began experiencing price increases much quicker than before. As a result of those new pressures, ratemaking cases before state commissions began to become more frequent and in some cases, more contentious. In many cases, when the utility applies for a MRP to its state regulator, it will request an increase for each year covered by the requested plan, but sometimes a utility will revise or lower its rate increase request. For example, in 1993, Connecticut Light and Power Company (now called Eversource Energy) reduced its proposed three-year rate increase in an amended request to state utility regulators. In some cases, the utility regulators themselves encourage utilities to adopt a MRP. For example, in 2009, New York's utility regulator urged Con Edison to consider applying for a MRP when it approved a one-time, one-year rate increase of $523.4 million, saying that the one-year rate increase was not sufficient enough to meet all the challenges that Con Edison was facing. Almost two decades earlier, in 1992, Con Ed had reached its ninth consecutive year of price freezes or cuts for its utility customers. However, faced with increased costs, Con Ed and the New York Public Service Commission made an agreement on a MRP to implement a 19.8 percent rate increase over a 3-year period.  State examples  = North Carolina = In 2019, a bill (Senate Bill 559) worked its way through the North Carolina legislature that would have allowed Duke Energy, one of the state's electric utilities, to have a multi-year rate for up to five years. Duke Energy argued that a multi-year plan would help the company pay for storm recovery and upgrades to the grid. However, legislators ended up removing the part of Senate Bill 559 that would have allowed multi-year rate plans for Duke Energy. Instead, the legislature kept in the provision of the bill that allows Duke to \\"recover storm-related costs.\\" According to The News & Observer, the bill would allow Duke and other state utilities to use bonds to raise money to pay for storm recovery. (There was a bipartisan coalition in the state Senate that had approved the original bill, but members of the state House were not behind the original bill). = Colorado = In 2011, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission approved a multi-year rate plan submitted by Xcel Energy. The MRP increased the base rate that Xcel could charge, firmly set the annual increase in base rates, consolidated authority to the state's commission for annual adjustments to base rates, and prohibited any additional increases in rates. = Hawaii = In 2019, the Public Utilities Commission of Hawaii began conducting an investigative proceeding that looked into the consideration of a five-year multi-rate plan. Under the proposal, the state's utilities' rates would be based on revenue numbers set by the commission in an attempt to control costs and get savings for Hawaii's utility customers. = Maryland = The Maryland Public Service Commission implemented a multi-year rate plan design that spread \\"rate changes over multiple years and [decreased] the administrative burden on regulators by staggering filings over several years.‚Äù = Minnesota = According to the Minneapolis-based Star Tribune, Xcel Energy, which provides power to 1.3 million customers, requested a 3-year rate increase totaling 15.2% in 2019 with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. = New York = In early 2019, Con Edison applied to the New York Public Service Commission to increase electric rates by $210 million in New York state in 2020. Under the plan, a typical New York City residential customer would see a monthly rate increase of $4.45 to $81.78, while a typical commercial customer would see a monthly increase of $80.96 to $1,970.67. Although Con Edison's application to the commission covered a single year, the company said it was having discussions with commissioners about a multi-year rate plan, which would lower the price increases to consumers.

Her naked corpse was found floating in the sea near Yau Tong, Hong Kong on 22 September 2019. Following a preliminary autopsy, police asserted that no foul play was suspected and that Chan had killed herself, while some protesters spread conspiracy theories alleging she was murdered by Hong Kong authorities in connection with her participation in the 2019 Hong Kong protests. The coroner's inquest concluded with the jury unanimously returning an open verdict, as the cause of death could not be determined, after Magistrate Ko Wai-hung ruled out both homicide and suicide as possible causes due to insufficient evidence to support this.  Background  Chan Yin-lam was 15 years old, and her parents were separated. With a \\"complicated\\" family background, she had a history of running away from home. Prior to her disappearance, she had been staying at a girls' home. She attended the Pok Oi Hospital Tang Pui King Memorial College, Hong Kong, and had, just a few days prior to her disappearance, started a course at the Youth College attached to the Vocational Training Council (VTC). She also worked a part-time job in the restaurant trade. Media reports indicate that Chan had won awards in inter- school swimming competitions. Chan had received regular diving training and was once a member of the diving team. According to her friends, she had attended protests, while police confirmed that Chan had not been arrested during the 2019 protests.  Disappearance and death  On 19 September at 14:15, Chan left a group of friends at Mei Foo and sent a message to some friends stating she was going back home. It was her last message before her disappearance. Friends put out a missing person's brief after she failed to reappear; her family called the police on 21 September. According to surveillance footage from Youth College she attended, she left the campus barefoot and walked towards the waterfront near Tseung Kwan O on 19 September. She was reported missing two days later. MTR confirmed that station cleaners had found a mobile phone and some stationery belonging to Chan on the ground near an exit of Tiu Keng Leng Station, while the station staff contacted Chan's family members as confirmed by the call log of the mobile phone. Her family member picked up the lost property two days later. At 11 am on 22 September, a man who was fishing saw a floating object with a human form 100m off the coast from Devil's Peak. Police boats were dispatched, and it was found to be the naked corpse of a human female. Police initially reported that the victim was a female suspected of being between 25 and 30 years of age, 1.5m in height, medium build, with long blond hair. On 9 October, in responding to media inquiries, police confirmed that the naked corpse belonged to the 15-year-old Chan. According to a preliminary autopsy, there were no lacerations or contusions on her body, and no sign of sexual assault. Although her death was later considered \\"not suspicious\\" by the police, the police originally requested a court warrant on 27 September on the grounds that the case was a murder, but changed the categorization to \\"dead body found\\" several days later. Her body was cremated on 10 October, the day after police had confirmed the corpse as Chan's. Conspiracy theories and reactions A Lennon Wall at Hong Kong Design Institute, the school Chan attended before her death. Following her death, conspiracy theories emerged on social media that alleged that the police and government officials murdered her for participating in the 2019 Hong Kong protests and then covered-up her death. The Hong Kong police and government have denied these allegations. = HKDI footage = Fueled by these conspiracy theories, students from Youth College and Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI) Tiu King Leng campus where she was a student gathered to demand the release of the CCTV footage taken on the evening of 19 September, where Chan was last seen before her death. On 15 October, after a sit-in, campus management agreed to accede to the demands and released some relevant footage. Dissatisfied with partial footage, disgruntled students demanded complete and unedited footage, giving a 30-minute deadline. Upon expiry of the deadline, the students vandalised school premises, damaged surveillance cameras and set off a fire alarm. The VTC later suspended all classes on the Tiu Keng Leng campus of the HKDI, Youth College and other institutions between 15 and 17 October. The VTC has since released additional CCTV clips after 200 students, amid class suspension, rallied inside the campus to support an online appeal for an indefinite class boycott. The 16 clips released showed Chan wandering around campus for more than an hour. After the Design Institute had disclosed surveillance videos and the girl's mother had appealed for an end to the speculation of Chan's death, students continued to demand the release of integral footage from surveillance cameras for 29 and 30 October. Masked protesters accused the school of downplaying the situation; they continued to damage facilities and equipment on campus for two days, with the police ended up having to be called. Cynics have suggested that the girl dressed in a loose top and pants on the footage showed an imposter and not Chan Yin-lam. Some also accused the girl on the footage to be an actress involved in some cover-up by authorities. For the coroner's inquest, Chan's family members, social workers, and friends all identified the girl on the footage as Chan. Ho Yun-loi, her grandfather, added that he saw Chan in the same clothing on the morning of 19 September. The Coroner's Court jury accepted in the verdict that the girl in the footage was Chan. = Cremation = Former forensic pathologist Philip Beh Swan-lip commented that the circumstances of the discovery and cremation of Chan's body were suspicious: discoveries of fully naked bodies in the sea are generally treated as suspect and would require thorough investigations, yet Beh's opinion is that Chan's body was hastily cremated after a preliminary autopsy. Beh opined that police should release further information about the autopsy and a coroner's inquest should be undertaken to allay suspicions of police misconduct. People accused the police for allowing the cremation of Chan's body soon after the death, but the police countered that it was the cremation order granted by the coroner that authorised the process. = Interview and harassment of Chan's mother = In an interview with TVB News on 17 October, Chan's mother, Ho Pui-yee, said that after looking at all the relevant CCTV footage, she believed that her daughter's death was a suicide. She said that although she was initially suspicious of the death of Chan, she said that her daughter was not emotionally stable, and may well have had psychosis as demonstrated by auditory hallucination wherein she kept hearing a male voice talk to her resulting in her having difficulty sleeping. She said that her daughter once participated in distributing the leaflet of the protests in June, but had become disillusioned by July. She added that she had been doxxed since her daughter's death, resulting in her being harassed at work and telephoned at all hours. Ho pleaded to the general public to end the speculation and for her to be left alone. Ho's interview and the police's assertion that Chan had killed herself were met with some skepticism: a political activist who knows Chan's brother doubted that Chan had killed herself by drowning, citing the fact that she was an award-winning swimmer. Some disputed Ho's identity in the early days following Chan's death. She had long hair and wore a surgical mask in her TV interview, but some people online pointed to Facebook photos of Chan's mother with shorter hair in July 2019 to question the identity of Ho as Chan's mother. In response to the rumours by anti-government activists and sceptics about the identity of Chan's mother, a DNA test was conducted for the Coroner's Court inquest. The test was performed on 9 July 2020 and verified Ho's identity as Chan's mother. On 24 August 2020, a gathered crowd started harassing Chan's mother, calling her things like \\"fake mum\\" and \\"actress\\", as she left the Coroner's Court hearing; two people including a known anti- government protester were arrested for public order offences. = Cultural references = In the self-penned Cantonese composition \\"Explicit Comment\\" (‰∫∫Ë©±) released in late 2019, singer-songwriter Charmaine Fong made reference to the public's scepticism of the official narrative of Chan's death with the lyric \\"The truth has long since disappeared, write your ridiculous plots\\". In the associated music video, the last-known footage of Chan and of police press conferences are juxtaposed. Coroner's Court inquest A coroner's inquest took place in late August and early September of 2020 to investigate the cause and circumstances of Chan Yin-lam's death. =Mental state= Social worker Wong Yin-lai stated that, in March 2019, Chan tried to suffocate herself with a plastic bag, for which she was sent to the Tuen Mun Hospital, but Wong did not believe that Chan had suicidal tendencies and viewed it as an attempt to escape from her girls' home. Doctor Lam Chi-pang of Tuen Mun Hospital said that Chan had self-harm intentions and was diagnosed with acute stress disorder and defiant disorder. Psychiatrist Yeung Yu-hang of Castle Peak Hospital, who visited Chan in the Tuen Mun Hospital after she damaged facilities in the girls' home on 19 August 2019, said that Chan revealed to him that she was hearing two voices in her head that were blaming her and thus started harming herself, but that she did not want to kill herself. Lam Chi- pang and psychiatrist Sarah Theresa Chung also repeated the same observation that Chan did not want to kill herself. Wong recalled that, after Chan's discharge from the hospital on 22 August, Chan told her that she heard voices inside her head when she did not sleep well. Wong also said that Chan appeared normal after taking sedatives prescribed by the hospital, but that she was unsure if Chan had stopped taking them before her death. As expert witness, the forensic psychiatrist Robyn Ho (Ho Mei-yee) said that Chan appeared to show symptoms of multiple mental illnesses and that her symptoms (such as her confused state of mind, capricious behaviour, and complaints about hearing non-existent voices) suggested that she suffered from an early stage of psychosis, a condition that brings a higher risk of suicide and may result in difficulty with body coordination during an episode. She also pointed to Chan's increased risk for mental illness due to her family history as her father had been hospitalised several times for several months at a time due to his psychosis. According to Ho, Chan's behavior demonstrated signs of a potential psychotic break in the period leading to the death. In the verdict, the jury said that they could not ascertain whether Chan exhibited psychotic symptoms on 19 September 2019. They noted the failure of the Hospital Authority to effectively follow up on cases of teenagers with mental health issues, especially after the inquest heard that Chan might have developed psychotic symptoms a month before her death. The jurors made the recommendation that the institution should review how juvenile patients are followed up after psychiatric consultations. =Course of action= Chiu Kwan- yi, a classmate of Chan, said that Chan showed odd behaviour on the final day before her disappearance. Chan had returned to school at 11 AM and used a classmate's schoolbag as pillow to sleep on a classroom floor, but got up 10 minutes later after the teacher and other classmates repeatedly urged her, and explained her lateness to Chiu in a WhatsApp message that \\"It's so scary. I spent the whole night awake and packing stuff. Crazy.\\" After her class ended at 1 PM, Chan was clearing her school locker for half an hour and said to Chiu that she would return to the Tseung Kwan O campus that night but did not give a reason for it. Then, Chan and Chiu together went to Tiu Keng Leng MTR station and took a train, but Chan refused to take a seat and sat on the floor instead. Chan did not change trains at Mei Foo station, as she usually would do with Chiu, and said that she would not return home that afternoon. In WhatsApp, Chan wrote that she went to Prince Edward station and arrived at a shopping centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. Chan's last message, sent at 5.18 PM, was a cryptic \\"That's very bad of you guys,\\" but Chiu said that she did not understand what it meant. Ho Yun-loi, Chan's grandfather, said that Chan was packing her room overnight and complained about hearing voices that made it difficult for her to sleep. The court heard that Chan, as seen in security footage, returned to Tiu Keng Leng MTR station at 5.40 PM and left some of her personal possessions including a mobile phone outside the station's exit A before she walked away. Chong Lam-kin, the station's control officer, said that he learned that Chan's mother was outside Hong Kong and did not know her daughter's whereabouts when he used the phone to call the mother one hour later. The police showed a compilation of footage showing Chan, initially wearing shoes and later barefooted, walking throughout the Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI) for 70 minutes from 5.50 to 7 PM when she left the premise without footwear towards a nearby housing estate. Detective Constable Lee Ho- kit said that they concluded from the footage that Chan had safely departed from HKDI that night. In the footage, Chan is seen leaving behind some of her belongings; the court heard that some were found on a bench in the podium floor of block B. Leung Po-yi, the HKDI administrative officer, said that Chan's belongings‚Äîincluding an identity card, a student ID, a mobile phone, and an Octopus card‚Äîwere turned in later that night. The police said that the Octopus card belonged to another person who lost the card one year before Chan's death and did not know Chan. Lee said that Chan's shoes could not be found. Chan Ka-chun, a HKDI graduate, stated that he saw Chan, looking sane but seemingly absent-mindedly searching for someone, wandering without wearing shoes at Tiu Keng Leng MTR station around 7.20 PM. Chow Tai-lai, a taxi driver, claimed that Chan got into his car and asked to be driven to a construction site next to Lohas Park MTR station, a few hundred metres from a promenade, on that night. Detective Constable Lee Ho-kit said that his team followed up on Chow's tip and investigated the area, but could not locate any relevant footage. He added that another team was tasked with locating Chan's clothes along the shore, but also made no relevant findings. The jury could not verify the veracity of Chow's statement. They concluded that Chan last appeared inside Tiu Keng Leng MTR station after 7 PM on 19 September 2019. =Examination of the body= Lau Yin-kai, the man who discovered the body, said that he and his son went fishing on a boat at 10 AM on 22 September 2019 near Devil's Peak, after which they saw the body floating in the water. Marine Police Superintendent Man Wai-cheung, who examined the body after it was airlifted to a marine police base in Sai Wan Ho on 22 September 2019, said that he did not find significant injuries on the body that could have caused death. Police Constable Chan Kwok-wing said that his superior, Man Wai-cheung, ruled the case as suspicious as the body was stark naked, but Man denied that he made such a classification as he could not give a preliminary finding on the circumstances of death due to the body's decomposed state and lack of apparent fatal injuries. When asked by the jury if Chan's clothes could have been washed away, Man answered that it was possible as summer clothes are lighter. The forensic pathologists Lai Sai-chak and Garrick Li (Li Yuk-wah), who both performed the autopsy, stated that there was a distinct possibility that Chan had drowned, given the lack of apparent fatal injuries on the body and indications that the body was in the water for a substantial period, but concluded that the cause of death could not be confirmed due to the decomposition of the body. They determined that Chan died within 24 hours after her disappearance on 19 September 2019. They believed that the body was in the water for a substantial period, as there was widespread shedding and bleaching of the skin on the limbs. They also found that the body was relatively intact despite the decay, suggesting that Chan was not subjected to violence or sexual assault before her death. Li stated that there was no fatal injuries or self-defense injuries on the body, and that there was no drugs or poison in the body but that a blood test for alcohol could not be conducted due to the body's decay. Wai Wing-kong, a chemist, found no conclusive evidence that Chan was sexually assaulted, as there was no DNA from another person in the vagina or under the fingernails. Lee Wing-man, a laboratory technologist, said that she found no fabrics inside Chan's fingernails, which could have indicated a dispute prior to death, but noted that it also could have been washed away by the sea current if it was present. Hong Yau-hin, a forensic toxicologist, stated that he concluded that Chan had not taken any medicine or drugs in the days before her death. As expert witness, medical professor and forensic pathologist Philip Beh (Beh Swan-lip) challenged the suggestion that Chan had drowned herself. Beh said that it was very unsettling that the body was stark naked when discovered in the water, since loose clothing could wash away but tight-fitting clothing such as underwear was unlikely to come off naturally. He agreed that it was difficult to determine the manner of death due to the body's decomposition, but pointed out that the volume of fluids found in Chan's lungs was much less and unusually uneven compared to typical cases of drowning. In response, Li said that he could not explain the findings, but could only guess that one side of the lungs bore more fluid due to faster decomposition at the other side. Beh also said that DNA evidence for sexual abuse could have been diluted in the water. He further criticised the pathologists' decision to not undertake a diatom test on the body, as diatoms of the nearby water would be found in the body to determine if a person had drowned. The jury concluded that Chan died between the night of 19 September and the following day. They also concluded that she was found naked because she entered the water without clothes on rather than that strong waves had washed the clothes away. They recommended that the Department of Health should conduct a diatom test in cases where the cause of death could not be determined due to decomposition of a body. =Verdict= Magistrate Ko Wai-hung ruled out suicide and homicide as possible causes for Chan's death due to insufficient evidence to support this. He stated that there was no evidence that Chan had been assaulted, bore grudges or had disputed with anyone, was under the threat of personal injury, or was under the influence of medicine or drugs, as well as that intoxication by an unidentified drug had no basis in established facts. He further stated that that the evidence was incompatible with suicide, citing the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The inquest resulted in an open verdict, as the jury was unable to determine the cause and circumstances of Chan's death. This verdict was made unanimously by the five-person jury. After the inquest ruling, the Hong Kong Police Force said that it was prepared to take further action in the case and made a public appeal for those with knowledge of the case to come forward. Ko ordered the police to retain one of Chan's mobile phones, an iPhone, for a year and investigate further if new evidence was obtained from the device; the phone was found locked, so data could not be retrieved from it.

Ojeda was a Mexican writer, director, screenwriter, actor, cinematographer, editor, producer, and production manager who worked in Hollywood and Mexico from the 1910s through the 1960s.  Biography  Manuel was born in Mexico in 1898 to parents of Spanish descent; he told reporters that his father was the Mexican ambassador to France, and the family spent time in Europe and Argentina when Manuel was young. When the Mexican Revolution broke out, the Ojedas relocated to Los Angeles, where Manuel pursued a career as an actor as early as 1912. Around 1920, he decided made plans to travel to Peru to produce films there with an American crew. It is unclear whether or not he was successful in that venture, but he then appears to have begun a career behind the camera in Mexico, starting with 1921's La Rosa del Desierto. In addition to a string of narrative features, he also directed a string of documentaries. Toward the end of his career, he worked as a production manager in Mexico.

It was established in 1919, as the Swiss Railwaymen's Association, and immediately affiliated to the Swiss Trade Union Federation. While it had a centralised political leadership, under Robert Bratschi, linked with the Social Democratic Party and based in Bern, many of its sectoral groups operated with a high degree of autonomy in industrial matters. While the main base of the union was workers for the public railway system, it accepted other transport workers, including bus workers, people working for private and municipal transport systems and workers in shipping. In 1995, it was renamed as the Swiss Railway and Transport Staff Association, to emphasise the role of these other workers, then in 2009 it became the \\"Union of Transport Workers\\".

She printed nearly 500 titles,Limbach: Life and Production of Magdalena Morhart, p. 153. including titles for the University and the W√ºrttemberg government.  Biography  Magdalena Kirschmann was born as daughter of Anna Breuning and Oswald Kirschmann.Limbach: Life and Production of Magdalena Morhart, p. 154. Her first husband was Jakob Gruppenbach, with whom she had at least four sons: Oswald, Jakob and Georg Gruppenbach and another. After Gruppenbach's death in 1540 she married Ulrich Morhart,Limbach: Life and Production of Magdalena Morhart, p. 155 f. who already had opened a printing press in T√ºbingen in 1523Johann Morhart: Haller Haus-Chronik. Eppinger, Schw√§bisch Hall 1962.. With Ulrich Morhart, she had at least one daughter, Magdalena the Younger.Das √§lteste T√ºbinger Ehebuch: 1553‚Äì1614. 3 volumes. Stuttgart 2000, p. 68. Ulrich Morhart died in 1554 and Magdalena Morhart continued to work in the print shop.Christoph Reske: Die Buchdrucker des 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts im deutschen Sprachgebiet. Auf der Grundlage des gleichnamigen Werkes von Josef Benzing. 2nd., rev. and ext. ed. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2015, , p. 1005. There were several challenges, such as the dispute with her stepson, Ulrich the Younger. He made claim to the print shop, but Magdalena Morhart was able to prevail, which led to a rift between the two.Morhart: Haller Haus-Chronik, p. 69. In addition, the plague broke out in T√ºbingen at the end of 1554, which made the completion of print jobs considerably more difficult. A few months after the death of Ulrich Morhart, a printer from Ulm came to T√ºbingen and asked the university for a loan so that he could operate his own printing press in T√ºbingen. He assured that he would not harm the heirs of Ulrich Morhart, but the university senate, which was responsible for the control of the book trade in T√ºbingen, rejected his request nevertheless.Limbach: Life and Production of Magdalena Mohrhart, pp. 160‚Äì162. Magdalena Mohrhart probably employed several journeymen. Whether she was allowed to employ apprentices is unclear. Most likely, her four sons and her daughter Magdalena the Younger helped in the print shop. Georg Gruppenbach delivered the books to the court in Stuttgart and received the payments. Oswald and Georg Gruppenbach printed in their own and were partly involved in the production by Magdalena Morhart, \\"nevertheless, most books were still produced by 'Ulrich Morharts Witfrau..' [Magdelena Morhart].\\"Limbach: Life and Production of Magdalena Morhart, p. 158. In 1554, two titles of her print shop were confiscated for violating censorship laws. In 1563, Sebastian Mayr, whose treatise Morhart printed, failed to obtain approval from the censors. The Duke of W√ºrttemberg stated that Morhart should be punished as a printer. What punishment this was is unknown.Limbach: Life and Production of Magdalena Morhart, p. 159 f. Despite these obstacles, her print shop was financially successful. Morhart printed important legal works, such as the Landrecht of W√ºrttemberg (VD16 W4513), which became a model for other territories. \\"Magdalena Morhart expanded the business and from the 1560s (at the latest), provided the service of book binding as well.\\"Limbach: Life and Production of Magdalena Morhart, p. 166.

In 2013, the group stood as ‚Äúthe longest continuously running non-profit group in the history of photography.‚Äù The collective was born when two groups of African-American photographers came together in collaboration. The first group was Group 35, which consisted of photographers James Ray Francis, Earl James, Louis Draper, Herman Howard, Calvin Wilson, and Calvin Mercer. Louis Draper was especially crucial to its founding. The other group did not yet have a name, but included African-American photographers Albert Fennar, James Mannas, Herbert Randall, and Shawn Walker. The first director of the group was Roy DeCarava, who led the collective from 1963 to 1965. Al Fennar suggested the newly united group of artists to name themselves Kamoinge, after reading Jomo Kenyatta‚Äôs book, written in 1962, called Facing Mount Kenya -- Kamoinge can be translated to ‚Äúa group of people who are working together‚Äù from the Kikuyu or Gikuyu language, which is spoken in Kenya primarily. The intent of the group is to cultivate a supportive and yet critical artistic community that captures black life in all of the photographers' vast experiences of it. Kamoinge member Deborah Willis is quoted in Timeless: Photographs by Kamoinge as saying ‚ÄúWe have seen countless images of black life across the diaspora and I consider these photographs to be a mosaic of the black experience.\\" The group as a unit captures photos of black life in its complexity rather than in a stereotypical or clich√©d manner.  Membership  In late 1963, Kamoinge adopted members Herb Robinson, David Carter, Adger Cowans, and Anthony Barboza into the collective. Beuford Smith became a member in 1965, and the first female member to join the collective was Ming Smith, who joined in 1972‚Äîalso in that year C. Daniel Dawson became a member. In 2001, Collette V. Fournier, Budd Williams, and Eli Reed were invited by Kamoinge members to join the collective. In 2003, Spencer Burnett, June Truesdale, and Gerald Cyrus joined. In 2004, Mark Blackshear, Jerry Jack, and Russell K. Frederick joined, and in 2005 Salimah Ali and Radcliffe Roye joined. Also in 2004, Anthony Barboza became president of Kamoinge. In 2009 Darryl Sivad and Ronald Herd joined Kamoinge. As of 2014, there had been 30 members of Kamoinge, including: Anthony Barboza (President), Adger W. Cowans (Vice President), Herb Robinson (Treasurer), Ronald Herard, Herbert Randall (founder), Collette V. Fournier, John Pinderhughes, Salimah Ali, Ming Smith, Beuford Smith (President Emeritus), Russell Frederick, Gerald Cyrus, June Truesdale, Mark Blackshear, C. Daniel Dawson, Shawn Walker (Founder), Radcliffe Roye, Albert Fennar (Founder), Darryl Sivad, Budd Williams, Jimmie Mannas, Eli Reed, and Frank Stewart. Deceased members include Louis Draper (Founder and president from 1990-1997), James Ray Frances (Founder), Steve Martin, Jerry Jack, Herman Howard, Calvin Wilson, and Toni Parks.  Works, exhibitions, affiliations  From 1964 to 1965, Kamoinge members showed their work in two exhibitions titled Theme Black and The Negro Woman in a Harlem brownstone on a street known as Strivers Row. Since its founding in 1963, members of the collective have exhibited their works in the International Center of Photography, Countee Cullen Library, Harlem‚Äôs Studio Museum, as well as a host of other sites. The collective has also hosted lectures and published numerous portfolios. Kamoinge produced fifteen portfolios in its first year, ten of which were sent to institutions including The University of Ghana, Howard University, and Atlanta University, as well as to the Museum of Modern Art, Schomburg Library, and the Museum of Negro History. In 1965, Roy DeCarava put on a solo show, titled US, at the Countee Cullen Library in Harlem. In 1969, he had a survey exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem titled Through Black Eyes, where he addressed the black experience in America and its relation to black aesthetic. In 1972, Joe Walker, Joe Crawford, and Beuford Smith began to publish Kamoinge‚Äôs work in the Black Photographers Annual. This work came out to make up four volumes and included artists from across the United States. In 1974, Some of the photographs taken by members of Kamoinge were displayed at a gallery exhibit for the International Center of Photography, which caused the group to gain publicity. In Harlem, NY, from 1998 to 1999, through the efforts of Kamoinge member Shawn Walkers, the collective became affiliated with the Institute for Youth Entrepreneurship (IYE). In 2001, Kamoinge members Anthony Barboza and Beuford Smith were consultants to the Brooklyn Museum Exhibit, ‚ÄúCommitted to the Image: A Half Century of Black Photography in America.\\" In 2004, Kamoinge Inc. published their first book, titled The Sweet Breath of Life. In 2006 Kamoinge‚Äôs Mark Blackshear alongside artist Daniel Simmons curated ‚ÄúBlack Music,‚Äù an exhibit for the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM). In 2007, the first showing of ‚ÄúRevealing the Face of Katrina‚Äù at the HP Gallery at Calumet Photo, NY opened. The exhibition was curated by Kamoinge members Radcliffe Roye, C. Daniel Dawson, Russel Frederick, and John Pinderhughes. A second showing opened at the Gordon Parks Gallery at the College of New Rochelle at the Bronx Campus in 2009. In 2013,Timeless: Photographs of Kamoinge by Anthony Barboza, Herb Robinson, Quincy Troupe, and Vincent Alabiso was published. The group had been collectively working on putting the book together since 2010. ‚ÄúWorking Together: The Photographers of the Kamoinge Workshop‚Äù exhibition will take place at the Whitney Museum of American Art from July until October 2020. The exhibition ‚Äúchronicles the formative years of the Kamoinge Workshop‚Äù and ‚Äúfocuses on influential works of founding Kamoinge members during the first two decades of the collective.\\" The exhibition will also be shown at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts from February 1, 2020 - June 14, 2020.  Reception  In July 1966, Swiss editor and photographer Allan Portei published a Kamoinge portfolio in an issue of Camera titled ‚ÄúHarlem,‚Äù despite the majority of pictures being taken outside of Harlem. Deborah Willis says in Timeless: Photographs by Kamoinge, ‚ÄúWe have seen countless images of black life across the diaspora and I consider these photographs to be a mosaic of the black experience.\\" In 1972, Roy Gibson described the foundations of Kamoinge as deriving from ‚Äúa common need to form black esthetic.‚Äù In 1996, Peter Gelassi said ‚ÄúThe Harlem neighborhood was both its [Kamoinge‚Äôs] essential subject and intended principle audience,‚Äù despite few Kamoinge photographers living in or photographing Harlem exclusively. Beuford Smith, in a 2001 interview, reflected on the misconceptions of black aesthetic, noting, ‚ÄúI think black aesthetic is different for everyone‚Ä¶ I think it is based on how you live as a black person.\\"  External links  *B&H; Photography Podcast: Kamoinge Collective and \\"The Black Woman Power and Grace.\\" *Working Together: Louis Draper and the Kamoinge Workshop. *Delphine Diallo.

International response In January 2016, a joint statement was released by the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Article 19, the Gulf Center for Human Rights, the International Service for Human Rights, and Reporters Without Borders. The statement raised concerns over articles 4, 6, and 7, which the groups believed could be \\"used to limit freedom of expression on the Internet, as well as to target online activists\\" and \\"individual human rights defenders\\". They called on the Kuwaiti authorities to repeal the selected articles of Law No. 63, as well as the entirety of the Press and Publications Law. The Human Rights Watch argued that articles 6, 7, and 13 work as an \\"effective barrier to critical political speech over the Internet, contrary to essential safeguards that article 19 of the ICCPR provides\\".

Curated by Thelma Golden and associate curator Christine Y. Kim, the exhibition featured the works of 35 emerging Black artists. Frequency, following the 2001 exhibition \\"Freestyle,\\" is one of five \\"F\\" themed exhibitions alongside Flow, Fore, and Fictions. While curators Golden and Kim point out that Frequency was not \\"Freestyle II,\\" the organization of artists under the umbrella of Black identity engages with \\"Post-Black\\" art similarly to the Freestyle exhibition.  Background  Following Freestyle's success in 2001, Golden felt at first that the necessity of curating a show whose work featured emerging black artists was not as immediate. She states in the Frequency brochure: \\"After the tremendous success of Freestyle in 2001, I had both privately and publicly acknowledged that there might no longer be a need for me to organize group shows featuring the works of emerging black artists.\\" While Golden had felt her project had made important strides in addressing a racially oblivious art world composed mainly of white graduate-level educated artists, events like Hurricane Katrina exposed racial tensions and issues of segregation anew. It was in this context that Frequency was organized and carried out. Artists featured in Freestyle further went on to score gallery positions and art-star status, creating expectations of similar celebrities in the following exhibition.

Critical Reception  Frequency is often characterized in relation to the Studio Museum's preceding exhibition Freestyle. Described as veering \\"between the flashy and the subdued,\\" the exhibition grappled with Black identity through a complex interplay between past and present. Melissa Gronlund, writing for frieze, saw the exhibition as an overly-ambitious attempt at referencing particular histories and racial stereotypes. Its aesthetic qualities, in her eyes, did not always reinforce the artistic sincerity of the work; Gronlund found more melancholic artists to be more genuine in their uses of a \\"craft aesthetic.\\" Writing for The Brooklyn Rail, Nick Stillman also takes note of the exhibition's identity-based conceptual work which goes beyond the creation of iconic imagery. The absence of and working around iconic \\"black\\" images reflects the curators' engagement with the \\"post-black\\" in this exhibit without a centralizing organizational principle.

The Brooklyn Fire Department, a paid firefighting force, replaced a 3,000-person volunteer fire department that was poorly equipped to serve Brooklyn's growing population. The Brooklyn Fire Department consisted of 13 engine companies and 6 ladder companies, as well as two fire boats. A headquarters building was built in Downtown Brooklyn in 1894. and several firehouses were built in the mid-1890s when Brooklyn annexed several smaller towns. The Brooklyn Fire Department was subsumed into the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) in 1898, upon Brooklyn's consolidation with New York City.  History  Initially, the city of Brooklyn was covered by several volunteer fire departments, mostly close to the shore of the East River, where there were relatively high land values that consequently warranted more extensive fire protections. The first such company was founded in 1785 in Brooklyn Heights, and consisted of an engineer and five firemen operating from a firehouse near Cadman Plaza. The volunteer force grew to 3,000 by the mid-19th century, and as the number of fires increased, so did the amount of losses. Since other cities in the U.S. would develop professional firefighting forces, several residents and insurance workers started advocating for such a force in the city of Brooklyn. A bill for the establishment of a paid fire department was introduced in the Brooklyn city council in 1858, though the bill was not passed. In May 1869, another piece of legislation to create a professional, paid firefighting force was passed and signed by New York governor John T. Hoffman. The bill enabled the appointment of several fire commissioners, who in turn hired various staff and procured the BFD's apparatus. The Brooklyn Fire Department, a paid firefighting force, was organized on September 15, 1869, replacing the 3,000-person volunteer force. According to an official BFD history, the volunteer department had been made obsolete due to technological advances that rendered the volunteers unable to respond efficiently to fires. Upon its organization, the Brooklyn Fire Department consisted of 13 engine companies and 6 ladder companies, though several new engine and ladder companies were added over the following years. By 1870, the cities of Brooklyn and Williamsburg had merged their volunteer fire departments with the BFD. Several other towns were annexed into Brooklyn in the 1880s and 1890s, namely Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, and New Utrecht. As they were annexed, these municipalities merged their volunteer fire departments with the BFD. Under Fire Commissioner Frederick W. Wurster, the Brooklyn Fire Department built several new firehouses in the newly annexed areas in 1894. After the 1898 consolidation of Brooklyn with the other four boroughs and creation of the modern City of New York, the companies and equipment of the Brooklyn and Long Island City Fire Departments were merged with the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) on January 28, 1898. The companies of the former Queens and Brooklyn fire departments were renumbered in 1913.  Equipment  David A. Boody The department operated two fireboats, the Seth Low and David A. Boody. The Seth Low, named for Brooklyn mayor Seth Low, was a wooden-hull boat used by the BFD and then the FDNY from 1885 to 1917. The David A. Boody was built in 1892 and was used by the BFD and FDNY until her scrapping in 1916.  Facilities  Former Brooklyn Fire Department firehouse, Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn = Headquarters = Around 1890, the Brooklyn Fire Department began planning for the construction of a new fire headquarters with a tall lookout tower. The BFD commissioned Frank Freeman to design the Brooklyn Fire Headquarters on Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The new building was nearly completed in 1892, although the fire department did not occupy the building until March 1894. Though originally intended as the department's headquarters, it served in this role for only four years until the Brooklyn Fire Department was incorporated into the FDNY. The building was converted to residential use in 2015. = Fire houses and bell towers = Before the rise of the fire alarm system, the Brooklyn Fire Department had four bell towers from which firefighters could spot fires from afar. These were located at Brooklyn City Hall; the intersection of Hicks and Sackett Streets in Cobble Hill, south Brooklyn; the intersection of North First Street and Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, north Brooklyn; and the intersection of Ten Eycke and Manhattan Avenue (formerly Ewen Street) in East Williamsburg, east Brooklyn. Only the City Hall tower was initially able to receive messages from the Brooklyn police department, but within a year of its foundation, lines were also run to North 1st Street and Hicks Street. These towers controlled the 14 districts in the city of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Fire Department also had a firehouse for each engine company. In 2013, two firehouses, Engine Company 240/Battalion 48 in Windsor Terrace and Engine Company 228 in Sunset Park, were made official city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission; both of these remain active FDNY firehouses.

Talented and charismatic, with a knack for rallying people, Davis was inclusive in his art and his life. He gathered his family and friends around him and refused to commit to a single figurative style or to use photographic images in a formulaic way. Nearly every canvas here is different, and most have an interpretive and painterly openness. Your eyes and mind enter them easily and roam through the different layers of brushwork and narrative suggestion. There's an unexpected optimism to all this. The paintings also dwell in silence, slow us down and hypnotize. paintings were known for being mostly figurative works depicting Black Americans in surreal landscapes.Source1 When talking about his work, Davis has said, \\"if I‚Äôm making any statement, it‚Äôs to just show black people in normal scenarios, where drugs and guns are nothing to do with it,\\" and describes his work as \\"instances where black aesthetics and modernist aesthetics collide.\\" Davis died at his home in Ojai on August 29, 2015 of a rare form of soft tissue cancer.  Early life  Noah Davis was born on June 3, 1983 in Seattle, Washington. Davis was the youngest son of Keven Davis, a lawyer, and Faith Childs-Davis, an educator. His older brother, Kahlil Joseph, is a noted filmmaker and video artist who has also shown work at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA). Beginnings and education Davis started painting in his early teenage years, and was so serious about his work that, according to his brother Kahlil, he had his own studio by the time he was just 17 years old. He went on to study at the Cooper Union School of Art in New York City, though he did not graduate. By 2004 he had moved to Los Angeles, where he exhibited his paintings as early as 2007.

He learnt to play billiards at the age of 13 and received some playing lessons from John Roberts Sr. Following success as an amateur player, he became a professional in 1881. He was known as the leading exponent of repeated of the . In 1884, he completed 548 consecutive pots of the red in a match against Billy Mitchell, and in 1895,again against Mitchell, achieved 643 consecutive pots of the red. In October 1887, Peall and Mitchell played each other at the Royal Aquarium in a 15,000-up match advertised as the \\"All-in Championship.\\" Despite this billing, it was not actually recognised by the recently formed Billiard Association as a championship match.

Peall was the runner-up to Mitchell in the first of three \\"Championship of the World\\" tournaments promoted from 1889 to 1891 by manufacturers George Wright and Company, and won the other two. In 1891, the Billiard Association decided to run separate championship tournaments for both \\"spot-barred\\" matches, where there were restrictions on the number of consecutive pots of the red ball allowed, and for \\"all-in\\" matches, where there were no restrictions on consecutive pots.

The Clan Macpherson are in turn a member of the confederation of the Clan Chattan. Within the clan the surname Smith is considered synonymous with that of Gow and this is due to the family's progenitor being either of the surname Smith or of having been of the occupation of Blacksmith. They are known in Scottish Gaelic as the Sliochd an Gobh Cruim which means \\"the race of the crooked smith\\". Origins and the Battle of the North Inch In 1369, the Battle of the North Inch took place in Perth, Scotland and was fought as a trial by combat in front of Robert III of Scotland. On one side were the confederation of Clan Chattan and on the other side was the Clan Cameron. Thirty warriors were selected to represent each side, but one of the Chattan men fell sick prior to the commencement of the battle and it was therefore proposed that the Camerons should lose one man to keep the numbers even on each side. However, a local man from Perth named either Henry Wynd or Henry Smith who was either a smith or armourer, by trade volunteered to take the sick man's place on the condition that he would be paid a fee if he survived. According to John Scott Keltie, Henry was known as Gow Crom which is Scottish Gaelic for \\"Crooked Smith\\". Only one man of the Clan Cameron and eleven men of the Clan Chattan survived the battle, including Henry Wynd or Smith. Historian Charles Fraser-Mackintosh stated that Henry, who was a swordsman, had contributed greatly to the success of his side during the battle. Keltie stated that Henry was the only one of the survivors on the Chattan side who was not wounded and that by his excellence as a swordsman had mainly contributed to gain the day. After the battle Henry Smith was invited north, and adopted into the Clan Chattan where he became the progenitor of the family known in Scottish Gaelic as Sliochd an Gobh Cruim which means \\"the race of the crooked smith\\", according to Alexander Mackintosh-Shaw. According to Charles Fraser-Mackintosh, they are known as Sliochd a Ghobha Chrom and that Henry had twelve followers who to keep in his favor learned to make swords and how to use them. They spread out over the country and in time took the surname of Mackintosh who was their chief. Fraser-Mackintosh states that the Gows took protection of Mackintosh (who was the chief of Clan Chattan) in 1399. However, the modern publication Scots Kith & Kin (2014) states that the Gows were a sept of the Clan Macpherson who are also part of the Clan Chattan. Later Gows The name Thomas Gow is found in 1589 in a bond signed at Dunkeld between Mackintosh and MacDonald of Keppoch. James Gow is recorded as a tenant under Mackintosh in 1635 in Badenoch. The names William Gow and Ewen Gow are noted in Crathiecoy and Laggan, Badenoch in 1679. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the name Alexander Gow in Ruthven, Badenoch is found in the Jacobite army.

History B2 initially started off as a streetcar line in 1910, operating between Mount Rainier, MD, Municipal Place & Rhode Island Avenue & the Anacostia neighborhood of Southeast Washington D.C. The B2 streetcar line was later replaced by buses in 1923 and eventually became a Metrobus Route on February 4, 1973 when WMATA acquired four private bus companies that operated throughout the Washington D.C.

History  The company was founded as Optelecom in 1974 by William Culver and Gordon Gould to build optical networking products utilizing fiber optic cable, optical amplifiers and lasers. Today, it develops fiber optic communications products and laser systems for commercial and military customers. Previous to working together to form Optelecom, Culver was employed at IBM's Federal Systems Division, Quantum Electronics Department while Mr. Gould was working at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, (now the New York University Tandon School of Engineering). The two sought to focus on inventing and developing a new breakthrough technology for fiber optics for missile systems.‚Äù The firm‚Äôs products were based on Gould's invention of the optical amplifier and the laser -- his acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. On the day of his invention, he realized its potential in telecommunications, writing in his journal: ‚ÄúBrief statement of properties and possible uses of the Laser‚Ä¶..Applications to communications, radar, etc. are obvious.‚Äù In 1983, David R. Huber joined Culver and Gould at Optelecom, where he developed and patented optical amplifiers, optical multiplexed sensors, and a multiplexed optical data distribution system. Subsequently, Optelecom provided management, financial, and production assistance to Huber as a founding shareholder of Hydralite, Inc., later renamed Ciena Corp. At the launch of Ciena, Culver explained the goal as enabling a ‚Äúsingle, hair-thin cable to carry many signals simultaneously, with each one being piggybacked on a different frequency of light.‚Äù In the long run,\\" Culver said at the time, \\"the new venture could become a very significant portion of Optelecom's business.\\" In April 2005, Optelecom changed its corporate name to Optelecom- NKF as part of its acquisition of NKF Electronics. Optelecom-NKF products (communication products that transport data, video, and audio over high-speed internet, ethernet, and fiber optic cables) are produced in an ISO-9001 certified facility and supported by a global network of technical professionals and distribution partners. Optelecom-NKF was acquired by TKH Group N.V. of Haakbergent, Netherlands on January 27, 2011.

Jahn became a smelter, and then in 1909 began working for a trade union. By 1930, he was serving on the national executive of the United Union of German Railway Workers, and was an outspoken opponent of the Nazis. He opposed the dissolution of the unions in 1933, and managed to salvage a list of former union members in the Ruhr. This enabled him to set up a labour resistance group in the area, working closely with the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF). Jahn was arrested three times by the Nazis, the last being in 1935, after they discovered his resistance group. He fled to Prague, then on to Amsterdam, where from 1936 to 1938, he published a journal for German railway workers in opposition to the Nazis. In 1940, he escaped to London, travelling via Spain and Portugal, where he set up a group of German trade unionists which later affiliated to the National Group of German Labor Unionists in Britain, and also served on the council of the ITF. At the end of World War II, Jahn returned to Germany, and was a leading figure in reconstructing the trade unions. In 1949, he was elected as the first president of the new German Railwaymen's Federation, serving until 1958.

He sustained mortal wounds on August 5, 1862 during an engagement at Malvern Hill, and died several days later on August 11 while being transported north aboard the steamer S.R. Spaulding.  Early life  Henry Benson was born in Belleville, New Jersey. He enlisted in the United States Army on June 6, 1845. He served in the Mexican-American War, where he was breveted for \\"good qualities\\" to the rank of second lieutenant on June 28, 1848, later made permanent January 26, 1849. He commanded a battery of artillery in the field under General Zachary Taylor, and later General Winfield Scott at the siege of Mexico City. He was promoted to first lieutenant on March 2, 1853. In 1854, Lieutenant Benson was posted in Florida (likely since 1849) during the Army's mission to survey the state and build roads, protect settlers, and relocate the indigenous Seminole tribe‚Äîall of which contributed to the Third Seminole War (1855-58). He was heavily involved in the Army's surveying efforts, actively scouting road paths in the field, alternately present at Fort Myers, Fort Meade, Fort Thompson, and Fort Center. Arriving at Fort Center in April 1855, Benson noted his surroundings as \\"more disagreeable, unhealthy and devoid of interest than I had expected‚Ä¶.Mosquitos awful. 1,000,000,000 of them‚Ä¶.Hot‚Äì hot as fire all day.\\" In 1856, Benson was commander of the 2nd Artillery, Battery E. On August 2, 1856, that unit engaged the Seminoles at Punta Rassa, an action which concluded the 2nd Regiment of Artillery's duty in Florida. By the end of the year, all units were transferred back north, headquartered at Fort Hamilton, New York. In 1857, Battery E was sent to Kansas to assist in quelling unrest, headquartered at Fort Leavenworth. In 1860, Battery E was sent to Augusta, Georgia.  Civil War  2nd US Artillery, Battery M, commanded by Captain Henry Benson. Photo taken near Fair Oaks, Virginia, 1862. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Lieutenant Benson was attached to the 2nd Artillery, Battery C, commanded by Brigadier General Lewis G. Arnold, posted at Fort Independence, Massachusetts. In January 1861, Arnold's command was transferred to Fort Jefferson, Florida to aid in the preparation for war following the secession of Florida from the Union. Benson was instrumental in assisting with the transfer of heavy artillery from Fort Taylor (under command of Captain John Milton Brannan) to arm Fort Jefferson‚Äîdescribed by Arnold as \\"the key of the Gulf\\"‚Äî under the direction of Captain Montgomery C. Meigs. In April, 2nd Artillery, Battery M arrived in Florida. It had been sent to Fort Brown, Texas in April 1860 and barely evaded capture by Confederate forces at the outset of the war in April 1861 while fleeing to the Union lines and on to relieve besieged Fort Pickens, Florida. Fellow New Jersian artillerist Lieutenant Julius A. De Lagnel, whose 2nd Lieutenancy Benson succeeded in 1849, defected to the Confederate States in 1861. Benson transferred to Battery M at some point between January and May 1861, as both returned north to join the Virginia campaign in June. He was promoted to the rank of Captain on May 14, 1861, replacing Captain Henry J. Hunt of Battery M, who was promoted to Major. Battery M was engaged at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. Soon after, Battery M commander Major Henry J. Hunt was promoted to colonel as the Chief of Artillery for General George B. McClellan, and Benson assumed command of Battery M. In November 1861, Battery M was converted to a horse artillery battery, equipped with six 3-inch Ordnance rifles. In 1862 Battery M moved with the Army of the Potomac into Virginia as part of McClellan's Peninsula Campaign (March‚ÄìJuly 1862). Benson led his unit effectively through the Siege of Yorktown, the Battle of Hanover Court House, and the Battle of Seven Pines (Fair Oaks Station). At Seven Pines, Benson's Battery M had a combined total strength on May 31, 1862 of \\"four officers, 109 noncommissioned officers, mechanics, privates. . . . 141 horses, and six 3-inch rifled guns, with caissons and ammunition complete.\\" For his service, Captain Benson was reported to be a favorite officer of General McClellan. = Death = Steamer S.R. Spaulding After General Robert E. Lee repulsed McClellan's assaults against Richmond, Virginia, what followed was the Seven Days Battles (June 25-July 1, 1862). These battles proved disastrous for the Army of the Potomac, and McClellan refused to take further offensive action from his position at Harrison's Landing without reinforcements. On August 3, 1862, McClellan was ordered by General-in-Chief Henry Halleck to retreat from the peninsula to Aquia Creek and terminate his campaign in order to meet up with the Army of Virginia under General John Pope‚Äì an order he only begrudgingly complied with nearly two weeks later. On August 5, 1862, in a second engagement at Malvern Hill, Virginia (not to be confused with the earlier Battle of Malvern Hill), Benson's battery engaged two regiments of Confederate infantry and an artillery battery in the early hours of the morning. He was mortally wounded during the fire when his leg was broken by the fragment of a burst shell from one of Battery M's guns . Benson was removed to the hospital transport steamship S.R. Spaulding for transport north to medical treatment, but died at sea of his wounds on August 11, 1862. His remains were returned to his hometown of Belleville, New Jersey and buried in the Belleville Dutch Reformed Churchyard on August 13, 1862.  Legacy  In 1864, an artillery battery in defense of Washington, D.C., was named Battery Henry Benson. An Endicott Era coast artillery battery at Fort Worden was named after Benson in 1904.

After clearing out Ariminum, Urviventus, Urbinus and Auximus the road to Ravenna was open to the Byzantines. In late 539 or early 540 Belisarius, victor of engagements like Dara, Ad Decimum and Rome, marched on Ravenna while Vitalius was already in the area. Vitalius discovered a grain shipment destined for Ravenna and captured it. When news of the siege spread many Gothic garrisons began to surrender. The city itself was taken when Belisarius was offered the Ostrogothic throne and faked acceptance.  Background  First five years of the war in Ostrogothic Italy During the early part of the Gothic War, the Byzantine conquest of Italy, the Byzantines quickly captured a vast amount of land. among the captured cities was Rome which the Goths attempted to retake in a siege. During the Siege of Rome, the Byzantine commander John, successfully took Ariminum. This threatened the Gothic capital Ravenna so the Goths lifted the siege and moved against John. After successfully holding out against the Goths in Ariminum and capturing Urviventus, Urbinus, Fisula and Auximus, slowed down by fierce resistance at Auximus and the insubordination of Narses and John, the Byzantines were ready to march on Ravenna. Meanwhile Byzantine forces were campaigning too in Dalmatia, and Vitalius moved up from there poised also to threaten the Gothic capital.  Siege  = Starting negotiations = In late 539 or early 540 Belisarius advanced to Ravenna. A large force, commanded by Magnus, was sent to patrol the south bank of the Po River and threaten Ravenna from another direction. At the same time Vitalius was advancing from Dalmatia, arriving in a position to patrol the north bank of the Po. For unknown reasons the river had fallen to such a low level that ships, meant to supply Ravenna, were unable to proceed and were subsequently captured by Vitalius‚Äô forces. When the water rose again Vitalius sent the grain to Belisarius, who distributed it among Byzantine troops. Byzantine dominance on sea prevented the Goths from shipping any other grain to the city. Seeing how desperate the Gothic position was becoming Theudibert, king of the Franks, offered help to Witigis, the Gothic king, in return for a peaceful division of Italy. Hearing of the Frankish proposal, Belisarius sent an envoy of his own. The Byzantine envoy pointed out the oppression of the Thuringians and Burgundians by Frankish kings and the betrayal the Franks had committed earlier in the war, when they attacked the Goths with whom they were until then allied, an alliance made in secret despite an already existing one with the Byzantines. Witigis decided to take his chances with the Byzantines instead of with the Franks. = Final relief attempt = While Witigis was still deliberating, Belisarius sent Vitalius to Venetia in order to capture as many settlements as possible. At around the same time the grain stores in Ravenna caught fire. This was possibly caused by Byzantine agents or arranged by Matasuintha, queen of the Ostrogoths, who had been forced to marry Witigis. Another possible cause of the fire was lighting. Hearing of the siege the Gothic garrisons in the Cotian Alps decided to surrender. Belisarius accepted the surrender and sent troops to occupy the region. Uraias, a Gothic commander who had earlier fallen victim to the treachery of the Frank and been defeated in a surprise attack, now marched with an army of 4.000 men to relieve the city. When the Byzantines occupied the Cotian Alps, many of the families of Uraias‚Äô soldiers came in danger of being captured, forcing him to march there instead. Uraias besieged the Byzantine-Gothic army. Another Byzantine army moved into the area, leading to the families of Uraias‚Äô troops being captured anyway and his army disintegrating. Now there was no hope of Ravenna being relieved but the city was impregnable by land and ship, so it had to be starved out or taken by bribery or trickery. = Gothic surrender = A message from Justinian arrived, a light peace-deal, offering Witigis kingship over the territory north of the Po as the emperor‚Äôs vassal. As commander in the field Belisarius had to ratify it for it to go into effect but he refused to do so. The Gothic nobility was afraid of a peace-deal with the Byzantines as they would most likely be deported to the east of the empire, forced to fight the Sasanians. They secretly offered Belisarius the western imperial throne, when Witigis found out he voiced his support. Belisarius accepted the deal and made all pledges required of him by it except ones about the western throne, which he said he would make in the presence of Witigis. In May 540 Belisarius entered Ravenna, taking it for the east instead of the west. After he let the surrendered Goths go home, the Byzantines outnumbered the Goths in their former capitol. Upon hearing of the fall of the Ravenna the last remaining Gothic forces offered their surrender to Belisarius.

The franchise's title character was co-created by Straffi, known for his previous creation Winx Club, and Silvia Brena, the former director of Cosmopolitan Italy. Straffi and Brena co-wrote each of the comic issues and four Maya Fox novels. The series follows a young woman named Maya Fox who lives in London. After her father is murdered by a serial killer named Michael Gacy, Maya discovers that she has the ability to speak with the dead. While avoiding Gacy, she works to prevent an apocalypse in 2012. In Italy, the first Maya Fox novel and an extract from the first comic issue were jointly published on 28 October 2008 by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. Three sequel novels and a monthly comic magazine were released from 2009 to 2011. In late 2008, Iginio Straffi revealed plans for Maya Fox adaptations for both television and cinema, depending on the success of magazine sales. In 2010, a script for the feature film adaptation was written by Jane Prowse for a release date of late 2011. The project was left unfinished. Background In September 2005, Silvia Brena interviewed Iginio Straffi for the magazine IO Donna, which inspired a collaboration between the two. They met again in 2006 to develop a concept that would appeal to young adults between the ages of 15 and 25, a target that Brena called \\"one of the most attractive markets for those involved in entertainment.\\" Rainbow's publishing manager, Cristiana Buzzelli, carried out some research on what topics were popular with teenagers and found that \\"they are particularly fascinated by thrillers and the supernatural.\\" Working off of this idea, they centered the story of Maya Fox around the 2012 phenomenon, a belief that the world would end in December 2012. In an interview with the magazine Millionaire, Brena elaborated on the choice to focus on the apocalypse, saying that the \\"2012 date seemed perfect. Many peoples have attributed a high symbolic value to it‚Äînot only the Mayans, but also the Egyptians, the Cambodians, and the Europeans with Nostradamus. It marks an end, but also a rebirth. A date that is, in short, very 'salable'.\\" Straffi designed the titular character to appeal to rebellious teenagers, wearing dark makeup and black clothes. Like his previous works, Maya Foxs drawing style was heavily influenced by manga. Alessandra Rota of la Repubblica called the comics' visual style \\"very close to that of Japanese manga models, only a little less gloomy.\\" Publication history Mondadori Editore released the first novel (La predestinata) on 28 October 2008 with a print run of 40,000 copies. The second (Il quadrato magico) was published in November 2009; the third (Domani, 2012) was published in October 2010; and the fourth (2012, la rivelazione) was published in November 2011. The novel series was published internationally by Carlsen Verlag in Germany, by Pocket Jeunesse in France, and by Planeta Group in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. The comic stories were serialized across 12 issues of a teen magazine based on the Maya Fox character, called Maya Fox: Tag Your Life. Every issue featured thirty pages of a comic (each 30-page installment was called an \\"episode\\"). The first episode, Oltre la morte (Beyond Death), was included in both the first novel in October 2008 as well as the April 2009 launch issue of Tag Your Life. The magazine had a print run of 150,000 copies. Plot The lead characters of the series, Maya (left) and Trent (right). Three years after the murder of her father, David, Maya Fox discovers that she can communicate with the dead. She receives a message from David, warning her that the end of the world is near but that she can prevent it. While she rushes to solve a string of puzzles relating to the apocalypse, Maya learns that her father's killer, Michael Gacy, has escaped from prison. Michael sends multiple profane letters to Maya and her mother, indicating that he has made a plan to kill Maya on the last day of the month. When the day comes, Maya narrowly avoids Michael with the help of her father. Reception According to Rainbow in May 2009, the comic magazine sold approximately 70,000‚Äî80,000 copies every month in kiosks around Italy. As of August 2010, 100 thousand combined copies of the novel series had been sold worldwide. Reviewing the first novel based on Maya Fox, Alessandra Rota of la Repubblica wrote that its \\"presentation strategy is spot-on ... the ingredients of teenage angst are all there, as well as those of noir.\\" Kirill Reshetnikov of the Russian magazine Vzglyad complimented the series' blend of supernatural themes with a \\"sensible and charismatic\\" protagonist relatable to teenagers. He called Maya Fox \\"something so eclectic that it cannot be ignored.\\" Pino Cottogni of FantasyMagazine wrote that \\"Maya is destined to win over [Winx Club fans'] older sisters.\\" Credits *Iginio Straffi ‚Äì co-creator, co- director, character designer, story supervisor, art supervisor *Silvia Brena ‚Äì co-creator, co-director, story supervisor *Elena de' Grimani ‚Äì inks *Vincenzo Nisco ‚Äì art supervisor, penciller *Giulia Basile ‚Äì colors *Paolo Maddaleni ‚Äì colors *Nicola Pasquetto ‚Äì colors *Giorgio Viola ‚Äì colors *Red Whale (Francesco Artibani) ‚Äì lettering Credits adapted from the magazine's list of artists.

His principal campaign committee was called \\"Mike Bloomberg 2020, Inc.\\" The campaign officially launched on November 24, 2019 in Virginia, later than most other candidates for the Democratic nomination. Prior to launching his campaign, Bloomberg has been vocal in encouraging the Democratic Party to field a candidate with the best chance of defeating incumbent President Donald Trump. His political positions include gun control, climate change prevention, and city innovation. Bloomberg opted not to compete in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, instead beginning his campaign with the Super Tuesday states. He financed his campaign personally and refused donations. He spent over five hundred million dollars of his own money on his campaign, one of the greatest single campaign expenditures in American history. His campaign heavily relied on advertising, including the use of nationally aired television ads, social media influencers, and billboards in high-visibility locations. Bloomberg dropped out of the race on March 4, 2020, after winning only the territory of American Samoa on Super Tuesday while missing the 15% threshold in several states. He subsequently endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for the nomination, and announced an effort to use his campaign infrastructure to support Biden's primary bid and the eventual nominee. His lack of success among voters was attributed to poor debate performances, his former approval of stop-and-frisk in New York City and allegations of a sexist working environment at his company, Bloomberg LP.  Background  Michael Bloomberg is a billionaire businessman who ran as a Republican for Mayor of New York City in 2001, serving from 2002 to 2013. At various times in his life, he has been a Democrat, a Republican and an Independent. On March 5, 2019, Bloomberg announced that he would not run for president in 2020; instead he encouraged the Democratic Party to \\"nominate a Democrat who will be in the strongest position to defeat Donald Trump\\". Sometime during the spring of 2019, Bloomberg also founded Hawkfish, a data and tech start-up focused on supporting Democratic candidates. The company was reportedly active in Virginia and Kentucky elections before shifting focus to the Bloomberg campaign. On October 14, 2019, a day before the Democratic Party's fourth presidential debate, it was reported that Bloomberg was \\"still looking at\\" entering the race if Joe Biden were to drop out, but that \\"nothing can happen unless Biden drops out\\", according to an unnamed source reported to be close to the situation. Fellow billionaire Warren Buffett had expressed his approval of a potential Bloomberg presidential campaign as early as February 2019.  Activities prior to campaign launch  In March 2019, Bloomberg originally announced that he would not run for president. However, on November 7, 2019, Bloomberg changed his mind and announced that he was taking steps to enter the 2020 United States presidential election, and on November 8 he officially filed for the Alabama Democratic presidential primary. After qualifying in Michigan, on November 12, he filed his candidacy for the Arkansas primary. On November 13, he applied for the Tennessee ballot. On November 19, he gave three separate transactions of $106,500 to the Democratic National Committee along with $800,000 to the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund. Bloomberg has said he will begin his campaign with the Super Tuesday states, not competing in Iowa or New Hampshire. He did not attend his company's second annual New Economy Forum in Beijing on November 20, a sign that his developing presidential campaign was now \\"dead serious\\". The summit was on the same day as one of the Democratic presidential primary debates in Atlanta. He missed the deadline to file in New Hampshire, thus reinforcing his planned strategy to focus on the Super Tuesday states on March 3, Another sign of his presidential run came when the University of Minnesota cancelled Bloomberg's scheduled lecture at the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs on December 5, 2019, saying that it could be unlawful and against university policy to host him for such a lecture if he is a candidate. Bloomberg's \\"Everytown for Gun Safety\\" political bloc had previously contributed large sums of money to many Democrats running in the 2018 Minnesota statewide and legislative elections. Headquartered at facilities provided by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the campaign's staff at pre-launch included senior advisors Howard Wolfson, communications adviser Jason Schecter, advertising creator Bill Knapp, pollster Doug Schoen along with sometimes Bloomberg Philanthropies CEO Patti Harris and political consultants Brynne Craig, Mitch Stewart, and Dan Wagner; and, at launch, Kevin Sheekey (communications, government relations & marketing head for Bloomberg LP) was campaign manager. On November 21, 2019, Bloomberg filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission to declare himself as a Democratic candidate for president, though he said this was not a formal announcement, but a step towards making one if he decides to run.  Campaign  Bloomberg officially declared his candidacy on November 24, 2019, during a campaign event in Virginia as well as in a campaign spot touting himself as a \\"doer and a problem solver\\" broadcast on YouTube The campaign subsequently kicked off a television advertising campaign in about 100 markets within the Super Tuesday states, which are to contribute about 40 percent of total pledged delegates at the Democratic National Convention. On that date, his personal website, mikebloomberg.com, was repurposed for the presidential campaign.https://web.archive.org/web/20191124191220/http://www.mikebloomberg.com/ Wayback Machine capture on November 24, 2019 2:12PM ET (the capture from earlier that day still showed his personal site) In December 2019, Bloomberg hired Texas Democratic Party Vice Chair Carla Brailey as a senior campaign adviser and in January 2020, he hired California Democratic Party Vice Chair Alexandra Rooker for a senior advisory role. Both are superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg announced that he would finance his campaign personally and would not accept donations. In addition to spending on advertising, Bloomberg's campaign set aside between $15 million to $20 million to register a half million voters in five battleground states that had swung to Trump in 2016. =Bloomberg News= According to editor-in-chief John Micklethwait of Bloomberg News, because of Bloomberg's ownership of the News (which refrains from investigating its owner) as well as his candidacy in the Democratic Party primaries, it will likewise refrain from investigating rival candidates throughout the primaries. If \\"credible journalistic institutions\\" publish investigative reporting about any of the candidates, the News will \\"either publish those articles in full or summarize them,\\" Micklethwait said. The Bloomberg Industry Group union, which does not represent News journalists, protested the ban; former Washington bureau chief Megan Murphy said it was ‚Äústaggering‚Äù for the news outlet to prevent ‚Äúan army of unbelievably talented reporters and editors from covering massive, crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time\\"; and the Trump administration decredentialed News reporters from attending further 2020 Trump campaign events. The Atlantic notes that over the years, there have been numerous reports about the sexist work environment at Bloomberg News. Despite its promise not to investigate Bloomberg's presidential rivals, the news agency published a blistering report on the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren campaigns and spending on Amazon office supplies ($233,348.51 and $151,240.90 respectively, in nine months). Sanders campaign speechwriter David Sirota joined journalists in slamming the report. The article notes that Michael Bloomberg has not yet released his first campaign spending report. =Spending and advertising= Bloomberg speaking at a campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona in February 2020. Bloomberg decided on an unconventional primary strategy: not to compete in the four states that have primaries or caucuses in February, but to focus his efforts on the multi-state primary elections in March on what is known as Super Tuesday. Following the Iowa caucuses, after a delay in reporting the results produced a chaotic and uncertain outcome, he decided to double his television advertising in all the markets where he was already spending and to increase his campaign staff to 2,000 people. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Bloomberg spent $188 million on his presidential campaign, including $132 million on television ads, $8.2 million on digital ads, $3.3 million on polling, $1.5 million on rent, and $757,000 on airfare, including $646,000 for a private jet. By the end of January 2020, Bloomberg spent $300 million on his campaign and by February 2020 had exceeded $500 million. This caused the total spending in the presidential primary on behalf of all candidates to exceed $1 billion by February, an unprecedented figure for such an early point in a US presidential election. Television ads The campaign launched campaign ads in markets in every state nationally on December 4, 2019. By December 31, 2019 - five weeks after declaring his candidacy - he had spent or committed $200 million on advertising, producing \\"an onslaught of campaign commercials with no precedent in Democratic politics\\". Bloomberg spent $10 million on a 60-second ad slot during Super Bowl LIV that aired on February 2, 2020. Digital and social media campaigns Bloomberg's digital campaign set aside $100 million for anti-Trump social media ads in swing states. By January 2020, Bloomberg spent an estimated $15 million on pay-per-click Google ads promoting his campaign on search results for terms including \\"impeachment\\", \\"climate change\\", and \\"gun safety\\". In January 2020, Bloomberg spent $8.53 million in targeted Facebook ads. In addition to digital ads, Bloomberg's campaign recruited social media influencers to advertise online. The campaign used Tribe, a content marketplace for brands to solicit content from social media personalities, to offer a $150 payment to influencers who post a video or a still image with overlay text in support of Bloomberg. Bloomberg's campaign worked with Meme 2020, a social media company led by Jerry Media CEO Mick Purzycki, to pay popular Instagram accounts to post \\"self-aware ironic\\" memes about Bloomberg. In February 2020, the campaign hired 500 \\"deputy digital organizers\\", who are paid $2,500 per month to promote Bloomberg on their personal social media accounts and in text messages to their contact lists. Billboards In February 2020, Bloomberg's campaign purchased billboard space in Las Vegas, Nevada and Phoenix, Arizona ahead of President Trump's campaign rallies in the two cities. The billboards, placed in high- visibility locations along Trump's potential motorcade route and outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, displayed phrases including \\"Donald Trump cheats at golf\\", \\"Donald Trump eats burnt steak\\", \\"Donald Trump lost the popular vote\\", and \\"Donald Trump went broke running a casino.\\" =Voting= Bloomberg led the midnight vote in the tiny townships of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire. Although not on the ballot in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Bloomberg received three write-in votes in Dixville Notch: two in the Democratic primary and one in the Republican primary. =\\"Super Tuesday\\" results and suspension of campaign= In the March 3, 2020 \\"Super Tuesday\\" primaries, Bloomberg finished in third or fourth place in most of the 14 states involved, picking up a total of 61 delegates out of the more than 1,000 that were available.\\" Election 2020 ‚Äî Democratic Delegate Count\\", RealClearPolitics, March 5, 2020 On March 4, 2020, Bloomberg suspended his campaign, stating, \\"I‚Äôm a believer in using data to inform decisions. After yesterday‚Äôs results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible ‚Äì and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists.\\" Bloomberg then endorsed Joe Biden.Steinhauser, Paul, and Kelly Phares, \\"Mike Bloomberg suspends presidential campaign after Super Tuesday flop\\", Fox News, March 4, 2020 Following the suspension of his campaign, Bloomberg donated money to nonprofits which register people of color to vote. This includes a $2 million donation to Collective Future, a group that registers black voters, and a $500,000 donation to Voto Latino, which registers young Latinos as voters. Criticism and controversies =Prison phone bank= The Intercept reported on December 24, 2019, that the Bloomberg campaign had unwittingly used prison labor to support the campaign. Call center ProCom was contracted to make calls through a third-party vendor; two of the company's call centers are located in state prisons in Oklahoma. Female inmates at the Dr. Eddie Warrior Correctional Center called voters in California, ending the calls by revealing that the calls were paid for by the Bloomberg campaign but without mentioning they originated in a prison. The Bloomberg campaign acknowledged the calls but said they were unaware the calls originated in a prison and they have since severed ties with the company. ProCom said the company pays the Oklahoma minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, which then pays the people working in the call centers. Documents from the Department of Corrections indicate they pay a maximum monthly wage for the incarcerated of either $20.00 or $27.09 per month. = Plagiarized campaign materials = In February 2020, an analysis by The Intercept found that the Bloomberg campaign had plagiarized portions of its published policy proposals from news outlets, research publications, non-profit organizations, and policy groups without attribution. The report found that sections of the campaign's fact sheets for its plans on maternal care, LGBTQ equality, mental health, infrastructure, economy, tax policy, and mental health contained exact passages - ranging from individual sentences to full paragraphs - pulled from sources including CNN, CBS, Time, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, the American Medical Association, Everytown for Gun Safety, and Building America's Future Educational Fund, the latter two of which Bloomberg co- founded or financed. In response to the report, Bloomberg's campaign released a statement asserting that the lack of attribution resulted from its use of the email service, MailChimp, that it used to distribute the campaign material, explaining that MailChimp does not support footnote citations formatting. The campaign added, \\"When we announce policy platforms, we put together detailed fact sheets with context and supporting background, so that reporters understand the problem we‚Äôre trying to solve with our policy...We have since added citations and links to these documents.\\" =Former mayorality of New York City= \\"Stop and frisk\\" approval On February 5, 2015, Bloomberg made comments at the Aspen Institute and, while addressing issues of minority rights, policing policy, and gun control, Bloomberg had said that police should confiscate guns of African Americans between ages 15 and 25. \\"These kids think they‚Äôre going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed. So they just don‚Äôt have any long-term focus or anything. It‚Äôs a joke to have a gun. It‚Äôs a joke to pull a trigger.\\" He has stated that police should ‚Äúthrow [African Americans] up against the wall and frisk them.\\" Bloomberg's approval of stop-and-frisk policies in New York City during his mayoralty has received widespread condemnation from the public and police alike. He eventually disavowed the controversial practice after announcing his campaign. Bloomberg stayed at one point that \\"One of the unintended consequences is people say, 'Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana. They‚Äôre all minorities.' Yes, that‚Äôs true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that‚Äôs true. Why do you do it? Because that‚Äôs where all the crime is.\\" The comments were criticized by many as racist, including President Trump, who tweeted \\"WOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!\\" Bloomberg subsequently claimed that \\"I inherited the police practice of stop- and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95%, but I should‚Äôve done it faster and sooner. I regret that and I have apologized.‚Äù This claim has been disputed by many in the media, who point to Bloomberg‚Äôs past statements and actions as Mayor as evidence that he supported and expanded the practice. National co- chair of Sanders's campaign Nina Turner called for Bloomberg to drop out of the race over the issue. Sanders said at a February 16 dinner in Las Vegas, \\"Regardless of how much money a multibillionaire candidate is willing to spend on his election, we will not create the energy and excitement we need to defeat Donald Trump if that candidate pursued, advocated for and enacted racist policies like stop-and-frisk, which caused communities of color in his city to live in fear.\\" Comments regarding redlining In 2008 at the height of the housing/banking crisis, Bloomberg said at a university forum that the crisis \\"all started when there was a lot of pressure on banks to make loans to everyone,\\" even in poor neighborhoods, so that \\"banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn't as good as you would like.\\" When a video of these comments was published in February 2020, they were widely interpreted as saying that he had blamed the crisis at least in part on the end of redlining - the practice of refusing to make bank loans in poor or minority neighborhoods. In response, a Bloomberg spokesman said that Bloomberg had always opposed redlining and fought against it as mayor. = Allegedly profane or sexist comments; nondisclosure agreements = Bloomberg has received criticism during the February debate for disallowing women who had settled suits against his company to publicly air their grievances. On February 21, Bloomberg said that three women employed by his company, the only ones whose complaints related to him, would be released if desirous from their nondisclosure agreements. = Twitter troll accounts = Twitter had suspended 70 troll accounts that posted content in support of Bloomberg's presidential campaign. A Twitter spokesperson told TIME that it has \\"taken enforcement action on a group of accounts for violating our rules against platform manipulation and spam.\\" Twitter said that Bloomberg's campaign violated Twitter's rules against \\"creating multiple accounts to post duplicative content,\\" \\"posting identical or substantially similar Tweets or hashtags from multiple accounts you operate\\" and \\"coordinating with or compensating others to engage in artificial engagement or amplification, even if the people involved use only one account.\\" = Edited debate footage = On February 20, 2020, Bloomberg's official Twitter account shared a manipulated video of the previous night's Democratic debate in Las Vegas. The video featured Bloomberg saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only one here that‚Äôs ever started a business. Is that fair?‚Äù followed by a series of clips from various moments of the debate, which were edited together to appear as if Bloomberg's question was followed by 20 seconds of silence from the other candidates. Bloomberg's campaign responded to criticism by saying that the video was intended to be \\"tongue-in-cheek\\".  Debates  Bloomberg had declared his candidacy after most of the 2019 primary debates organized by the Democratic National Committee. After declaring, he failed to meet the requirements to participate in the debates December 2019 and January 2020 debates, as the DNC required participating candidates to demonstrate at least 4-percent support in at least four separate national polls approved by the DNC (or 6 percent in two early state polls), in addition to donations \\"from at least 200,000 unique donors overall, and a minimum of 800 unique donors in at least 20 states.\\" Various national polls conducted in December found that Bloomberg's candidacy registered at around four percent support. however he did not meet the donor threshold, as he was not accepting contributions. By early January 2020, Bloomberg was found by Real Clear Politics to have reached about 5.6% support nationally, but he again failed to meet the donors requirement for the January debate. On January 13, Bloomberg stated that \\"People often ask me, 'Why aren't you in the debates? It's simple: the party requires candidates to have a certain number of donations, but I've never accepted a nickel from anyone. Unlike President Trump, I've always been independent of the special interests. I hope the DNC changes its rules‚ÄîI'd gladly participate‚Äîbut I'm not going to change my principles.\\" During the January debate, he tweeted an image of his face on a meatball and other odd photos, which were poorly received by social media users. On January 31, 2020, the DNC changed its eligibility rules, eliminating the individual-donor threshold. This allowed Bloomberg to participate in future debates by merely meeting polling requirements. = February 19, 2020 debate = On February 18, 2020, Bloomberg qualified to participate in the February 19 debate in Nevada. Bloomberg's debut debate performance was poorly received, with some pundits saying that his performance was \\"among the worst in the history of presidential debates.\\" He was widely criticized for his answers regarding stop-and-frisk, workplace harassment, and allegations of harassment by female employees, many of whom were bound by non- disclosure agreements. Elizabeth Warren, as well as Joe Biden, challenged him to release the women from the non-disclosure agreements, to which he refused. It is reported that there are at least 64 women named in at least 40 lawsuits alleging sexual harassment or gender discrimination at Bloomberg LP. After the debate, at a rally in Salt Lake City, Utah, Bloomberg stated that \\"Trump was the real winner of Las Vegas debate\\" and claimed that \\"If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base like Senator Sanders, it will be a fatal error.\\" Bloomberg's campaign staff manager Kevin Sheekey claimed that the night was actually a success for Bloomberg, stating that \\"You know you are a winner when you are drawing attacks from all the candidates. Everyone came to destroy Mike tonight, it didn't happen. Everyone wanted him to lose his cool. He didn't do it. He was the grownup in the room.\\"  Political positions  Bloomberg, who has said in an editorial he believes climate change cannot await favorable political winds, has funded Beyond Carbon, modeled on the effort he had previously co-founded along with the Sierra Club, Beyond Coal, which he credits as contributing to the closing of half of the U.S.'s coal- fired power stations. He has advocated for greatly expanding U.S. healthcare programs to create essentially a hybrid single-payer healthcare he has dubbed \\"'Medicare for all' for people that are uncovered.\\" Bloomberg's \\"All-In Economy\\" agenda, especially focused on assisting mid-sized cities in the economically lagging American heartland in their becoming economic growth generators, would include increased federal funding for community-colleges, technical training programs, and job-creating research and development endeavors that \\"invest in college partnerships and apprenticeships that connect people with identifiable jobs and career paths\\"; provide to workers, whether gig work, contract and franchise employees, union organizing and collective bargaining rights; increase to the national minimum wage to $15 an hour; increase to the Earned Income Tax Credit; and, creating \\"Business Resource Centers\\" to assist entrepreneurs. Bloomberg's Greenwood Initiative aims to redress historic and institutional economic injustices that have affected Black Americans. The plan is focused on closing the economic gap between white and Black Americans by driving economic empowerment and helping to create generational wealth. Bloomberg said that he is open to spending 1 billion dollars to support the Democratic candidate in the presidential election, even if it will be Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. In February, the Sanders campaign declined financial help from Bloomberg should it receive the nomination and Bloomberg's spokesperson said Bloomberg would not assist a candidate who did not desire his assistance. Bloomberg also said that he will not run ads against his rivals in the Democratic primaries. Though on February 17, Bloomberg ran an attack ad against Sanders's supporters accusing them of using online bullying tactics to mute criticism of their candidate. The ad showed screenshots of alleged Sanders supporters using memes, alleged threatening texts, and other tweets. = Private spending toward policy goals = Part of Bloomberg's long-time political modus operandi is funding of various nonprofits in support of such issues he supports as gun control (Bloomberg is the primary funder of Everytown for Gun Safety), climate-change prevention, and city innovation. Campaigning in Philadelphia in January 2020, referencing $80 million he spent supporting Congressional candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, Bloomberg said, \\"I supported 24 candidates who were good on guns and good on environment, and 21 of them won, and that flipped the House. So if it wasn‚Äôt for that, you wouldn‚Äôt have [Speaker] Pelosi and you wouldn‚Äôt have impeachment.\\" Endorsements Bloomberg has faced criticism by a few media outlets for \\"buying endorsements\\". According to HuffPost, the presidential candidate donated millions of dollars to the Congressional candidates before later receiving their endorsements. Charities controlled by Michael Bloomberg, such as Bloomberg Philanthropies, have reportedly given grants and training to city mayors throughout the country soon forming a network of mayors willing to support his campaign. One incident reported by the Detroit Free Press had Bloomberg receiving an endorsement from Wayne County Executive Warren Evans after his campaign hired Evans's wife. Post campaign Bloomberg suspended his campaign on March 4, 2020, and he endorsed the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign.Michael Bloomberg Drops Out of 2020 Race ‚Äî And Backs Joe Biden BY ALANA ABRAMSON, Time, 4 March 2020, retrieved 24 Mar 2020 On March 20 he announced that he would transfer $18 million to the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

She served as the DREDF‚Äôs deputy and executive director, and president and chair of board of directors.

She currently serves as the senior policy advisor with DREDF, focusing on their healthcare research initiatives.Disability Rights and Defense Fund. \\"Mary Lou Breslin\\".  Early Life  Mary Lou Breslin was born in October 1944 and is a well-known figure in the disabled community through her activism and achievements for changing the way people with disabilities live their daily lives. She grew up with a polio-related disability in the 1950-1960's and had to face society‚Äôs harsh psychological and physical obstacles that came along with her visible physical disability. Through these obstacles, she remained optimistic even through the post war culture that would be reflected in the 1970's onward and wanted to take matters into her own hands. Although she got admitted to various universities, her options were limited because most of the schools would not accommodate her. She ended up attending University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign from 1962-1966 and earned her Bachelor of Arts in Sociology because they were more accessible than the rest of her options. Her first jobs included being a psychiatric state worker and working for an employment opportunity program that served the low-income population in Chicago. She was involved in the Vietnam war opposition and the 1968 Democratic Convention. In 1975, she was hired for the Physically Disabled Students Placement Project at UC Berkeley. It was in Berkeley that she began to learn about the few disability-related laws that existed at the time.Breslin, Mary Lou, & O‚ÄôHara, Susan \\"Selections From Cofounder and Director of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, Movement Strategist\\", Disability Rights and Independent Living Movement Oral History Series, (2000).  Activism  Mary Lou Breslin has been an advocate for disability rights law and policy for about 40 years. Breslin co-founded the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF), a national disability rights law and policy center established in 1979. Breslin played a crucial role in the creation of groundbreaking legislation ‚Äì including the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and inclusion of accessibility requirements in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. In the early 2000s, Breslin turned her attention to the reformation of health care for individuals with disabilities. She wanted to shift the viewpoints circulating in the healthcare industry and find ways that could better accommodate patients with physical disabilities, for example a height-adjustable exam table, to ensure there was no discrimination based on disability. There is often a lack of disability awareness among MCO's and providers regarding physical and programmatic accommodations; advocates and federal policy makers are finding new pathways to improve access and raise disability cultural awareness through means of provider education and new training requirements Mary Lou Breslin also worked with feminist policies and creating a more inclusive space. She has committed herself towards the fight for justice and advancing the social progress for women, disabled people, and disabled women.  Career  Mary Lou Breslin served as a researcher, trainer, and policy consultant in addition to lecturing on disability and related civil rights topics. Earlier in her career, Breslin taught graduate courses at the University of San Francisco and was an editor and researcher for Disability Rights and the Independent Living Project stemming in Berkeley, California. Besides work in the US, Breslin has provided consultations for disability rights leaders in Russia and Japan.  Trainings and DREDF  In 1978, Breslin began running trainings about Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a law which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in federally funded programs. In 1979, the DREDF separated from the Center for Independent Living. In 1980, Breslin assisted in creating a Washington office for the DREDF (which was previously located only in Berkeley). They were able to meet with members of the United States congress and discuss issues regarding Section 504. In addition, they formed alliances with disability organizations across the United States. In 1993, Breslin founded the DREDF Development Partnership, which supports and secures DREDF‚Äôs programs.  Research  During her career as a policy consultant, researcher, and trainer, Breslin taught graduate courses at the University of San Francisco Masugang Graduate School of Management. In 1996-2004, she served as editor and researcher with the Disability Rights and Independent Living Project of the Regional Oral History Office of the Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley. Her research has consisted mainly of written publications on various disability topics, specifically healthcare throughout the more recent years. In 2004, she became focused on health inequality for individuals with disabilities after a friend who used a wheelchair died from cancer after suffering from inadequate care, medical equipment, and lack of disability awareness from her medical provider. Since then, Breslin has successfully pushed for changes in policy and standards at the state and federal level. She has worked with selected Medicaid managed care organizations to develop model disability policies in California, and in Washington her research was vital for the inclusion of accessibility requirements in the 2010 Affordable Care Act.  Awards and Recognition  Mary Lou Breslin received the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Award from the University of California, San Francisco in 2015 which acknowledged DREDF‚Äôs advocacy on behalf of people with developmental disabilities. Earlier in her career she received a Mary E. Switzer Merit Fellowship in 1995. The Physical and Mental Disability Rights Committee of the American Bar Association awarded her and DREDF the Paul A. Hearne Award in 2000 and the community leadership award from the San Francisco foundation in 2009 for improving the lives of people with disabilities. In 2013, Breslin was named a Fellow by Encore.org.

Career  Deeter gained prominence in the theatre world in the 1919 production of Eugene O'Neill's Exorcism: A Play in One Act. A close relationship with O'Neill ensued, and Deeter joined the Provincetown Players, which was an experimental theatre group that produced many of O'Neill's one-act and full-length plays in New York City. Deeter appeared in several of O'Neill's plays, including The Hairy Ape and The Emperor Jones. Deeter is credited with convincing the playwright to cast a black actor, Charles Sidney Gilpin, in the lead role of Brutus Jones in The Emperor Jones. The play marked the first time that a major black role in a New York production was not performed by an actor in blackface. Deeter left New York as frictions between members of the company arose as a result of what many saw as a commercialization of the plays produced by the Provincetown Players. Many of the original members, including Deeter, believed commercial success to be at odds with the Provincetown Players' mission to create experimental works that weren't judged by box office numbers. He travelled to Rose Valley, Pennsylvania, where he became involved with the Rose Valley Arts and Crafts Community. It was here that Deeter found artisans and craftsmen such as Wharton Esherick, Elenore Plaisted Abbott, and others who built theatre set pieces, provided scenic artwork, and designed costumes. He also attracted the talents of actors such as Ann Harding, Eva LaGallienne, and Phil Price, Jr. Throughout its heyday from the late 1920s to the 1950s, Hedgerow Theatre presented plays by the leading playwrights of the time, including O'Neill, George Bernard Shaw, and Langston Hughes. In 1958, Deeter appeared in the role of the Civic Defense Volunteer in the cult classic The Blob, and in 1959, he had a leading part in the sci-fi thriller 4D Man. In his later years, he remained active with the theatre and died in Media, PA in 1972 at the age of 78.

The ruins are located on the edge of Gniezny canyon, near its mouth to Seret River. The fortification, the remains of which can still be seen, was built in the 1630s under the leadership of the Terebovlian starosta Alexander Balaban.  History  There have been at least three fortresses on the castle hill in Terebovlia. The first historical castle in the town, mentioned in the Old Russian writing Primary Chronicle, was a castle erected in 9th/10th century. The city achieved its greatest power during the reign of Prince Vasylko Rostyslavych, the great-grandson of the Grand Duke of Kiev Yaroslav the Wise.Frost V. Castles of Ternopil. - Ternopil Textbooks and manuals, 2009 - 176 pp. Prince Vasylko Rostyslavych's fortress was a wooden, enclosed palisade, and only the castle church within it was built of stone. The fortress had several defensive lines, but there was no water well. Archeologists suggest that the water was brought here underground or simply filled the reservoirs. This original castle was not like the one that has survived until now. Even the entrance to it was not from the east, as it is now, but from the north - from the modern park. There were cellars under the castle. After the death of Vasylko Rostyslavych in 1124, the Principality of Terebovlia became part of the Principality of Halych, and later part of the Halych-Volhynia principality. With the reign of Vladimir Igorevich of the Izyaslavych family, Terebovlya regained its independence. However, in 1211, in the battle with the Magyars, the prince was captured and executed along with his brothers and father. In those days, the wooden walls of the castle were replaced by stone, but in 1241 Terebovlia was completely destroyed by the hordes of Batu Khan. In 1341 the city is already mentioned as being conquered by the Poles. In 1346 the Polish king Casimir III the Great rebuilt the fortress. Little is known about this newer castle, but it was stone and walled. In 1448 Kazimierz Jagiello≈Ñczyk stayed here. In 1534, the castle was extended by Krak√≥w castellan Andrzej Tƒôczy≈Ñski. Plan of Terebovlia Castle During the 15th and 16th centuries Terebovlya fortress declined in importance due to constant attacks by Tatars. Within a few months, the Terebovlian Andrzej Tƒôczy≈Ñski - a castellan of the then Polish capital of Krakow - rebuilt it at his own expense. The necessity of repairing the castle was mentioned in the privilege of King Stephen B√°thory from November 30, 1576 (a copy was preserved L. L. Gorodishsky, I. Zinchyshyn Traveling in Terebovlya and Terebovlyanschyna pp. 61-62. ). In 1594 (July 1595 L. L. Gorodishsky, I. Zinchyshyn Traveling in Terebovlya and Terebovlyanschyna pp. 55.), Terebovlya was acquired by Severyn Nalyvaiko, but the castle was not damaged at that time. At the end of the 16th century the castle was repaired by the Terebovlian headman Jakub Pretwitch. From 1605-1625 the castle's importance declined after suffering 15 attacks by Crimean Tatars. Following these events, it was the turn of the fortress to build a stroll now. In 1631 the castle was rebuilt by the Trembowel starosta Andrzej Ba≈Çaban. The walls reach 3.5-5m in thickness and up to 18m in height. The entrance to the castle was made at height of 3m above the ground and could only be reached with the help of a special platform. It is suggested that during this castle renovation the church with grave of prince Vasylko Rostyslavych was destroyed. Cossacks captured castle in 1648, but after the armistice it was occupied by the Poles and frequently resisted attacks by Cossacks, Turks and Tatars. In course of Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1672‚Äì1676) Terebovlia castle became an important border fortress after the partition of Podolia by Turkey in 1671. Armistice in war followed by Treaty of Buchach which ultimately was rejected by Sejm of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and war resumed. In 1675 Mehmed IV sent a new 10,000-strong Turkish-Tatar army under command of Pasha Ibrahim Shyshman –Ü–ë–†–ê–ì–Ü–ú–ê –®–ò–®–ú–ê–ù-–ü–ê–®–Ü –ö–ê–ú–ü–ê–ù–Ü–Ø 1675 to enter Ukraine and on September 20 the siege of Terebovlya began. Despite considerable numerical advantage, Pasha Ibrahim Shyshman was unable to capture the castle and on October 11 retreated south in anticipation of the early start of winter season. This saved the rest of Podillya, Galicia from the attack. Terebovlia castle became famous for its heroic defense against Tatars and Turks.

Her division comprised approximately 80 staff and associates with a budget of $16 million. , Plant is a NIST Fellow where she researches measurements and models of cell populations. Plant's branch researches single-cell measurements from live cell microscopy, and development of theoretical approaches that lead to predictive understanding of complex cellular systems. Currently, Plant examines small molecular networks in engineered induced pluripotent stem cells with a statistical thermodynamics model. The heterogeneity of cellular phenotypes within isogenic populations provides a window into the diversity of ways the cellular machinery can operate to process information. This diversity of expression reflects the stochastic fluctuations that occur as connected network variables interact with one another to effect up- and down-regulation. Plant's lab goals include to measure the kinetic constants for those fluctuations, and the correlations between them, to provide a thermodynamic basis for understanding which cellular measurands are the most important for controlling a particular phenotype. This work is motivated by a critical challenge in characterizing cell-based therapies, namely what should be measured that will provide predictive information about the cell product to assure desirable functionality. Carrying out this study involves a large number of NIST collaborators to address challenges in rapid non-perturbing quantitative imaging, CRISPR-Cas genome editing of reporter iPSC lines, image analysis including the use of CNN inference, and theoretical modeling.  Awards and honors  In 1991 and 2011, Plant received the Department of Commerce Bronze Medal. She was awarded the Department of Commerce Silver Medal in 2007.

She has two grown-up sons, and worked as a bookkeeper for a restaurant chain in Edmonton, Alberta prior to her debut in the PDC World Darts Championship. Darts career King was introduced to the throwing game of darts by one of her older sisters Mary; her brother-in-law provided her with an instructional book which strengthened her interest in the sport. She made her British Darts Organisation debut in the 1989 World Masters where she was defeated in the preliminary round by Linda Beaver. She finished runner-up to Lillian Skears in the 1995 Klondike Open and repeated the result to Lorraine Colenutt in the 1996 contest. In 1997, King paired with Kim Whaley to win the women's doubles events of the Klondike Open, adding to a success in the tournament's ladies' cricket pairs division with Terry Towey in 1995. Two years later she won the women's singles and the ladies' doubles of the Manitoba Open and the Saskatoon Open ladies' pairs and ladies' cricket pairs with Laurie Court. King played in the 1997 WDF World Cup Ladies Pairs tournament in Perth, Australia with Patricia Farrell, where the duo lasted until the semi-finals. She also played for the Canadian national women's team. King went on to claim the singles, doubles and the mixed doubles divisions of the 2000 Canadian National Darts Championships, before she followed up with victories in the London Open in the singles and ladies pairs divisions, and that year's Ladies Canadian Open. She took a victory in the ladies cricket pairs and the mixed pairs divisions of the 2000 Klondike Open. King was runner-up to Stacy Bromberg in that year's Windy City Open Ladies and reached the last 64 of the World Ladies Masters. She played in the 2000 BDO World Masters and reached the tournament's first round. After a PDC World Darts Championship play-off qualification round of eight women players due to be held in conjunction with the 2000 World Grand Prix tournament was cancelled, the Professional Darts Corporation invited her to compete in the 2001 PDC World Darts Championship in Purfleet, Essex; it began in December 2000 and lasted until January 2001 and the PDC council allowed women to compete in the event. It telephoned King and she accepted their invitation. She became the first woman to participate in the PDC world championship. King lost her first round match 3‚Äì1 to the world number 29 Graeme Stoddart. Later in 2001, King reached the last 16 of the WDF World Cup Singles where she was defeated by Francis Hoenselaar. She won the Ladies Canadian Open and the Klondike Open twice more over the next four years in the singles divisions. King also played in the 2004 Las Vegas Desert Classic and had her final two professional matches at the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Vauxhall Open. Post-darts career She retired from competitive darts after a shoulder injury caused her to lose the endurance required to play in tournaments. King found employment at a cheese-making company working as an administrative assistant.

Huber is an American engineer specializing in optical networking. He is the holder and assignor of several patents in the field of optical transmission, distribution, and communication. David R. Huber received his B. S. degree in physics from Eastern Oregon State College in 1974 and his PhD degree in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University in 1980. Upon graduation, he began working at the Martin Marietta Company in the area of space instrumentation. It was in 1982 when his career focus changed to fiber optics receivers, wavelength division fiber-optic communication systems, and fiber-optic bandwidth and dispersion measurements while employed at ITT Corporation. Working at Optelecom from 1983 to 1988, Huber developed optical multiplexed sensors and a multiplexed fiber optic wideband data distribution system. In 1988, he joined General Instrument Corporation, where he patented several inventions, including Remote pumping for active optical devices, Method for producing a tunable erbium fiber laser, and wavelength selective coupler for high power optical communications. These technologies were core elements of the wave division multiplexing (‚ÄúWDM‚Äù) system developed by Huber. Huber returned to Optelecom in 1993 to develop optical networking systems by starting Hydralite Inc. (renamed Ciena Corp.) with Optelecom and entrepreneur Kevin Kimberlin. Their venture was chartered and the founders shares were issued to Huber, Kimberlin, and Optelecom on November 12, 1993. Optelecom took an ownership stake for providing management, financial, and production support for Ciena. Press coverage at that time noted that the firm would ‚Äúspecialize in equipment such as lasers, modulators, and amplifiers used to send data through fiber cables at very high rates.\\" Referred to as wave division multiplexing, the new technology would, according to William H. Culver, Optelecom's chairman, let ‚Äúa single, hair-thin cable carry many signals simultaneously, with each one being piggybacked on a different frequency of light.\\" In June, 1996, Ciena introduced the first dense WDM system. After Ciena went public, Huber left to start another optical networking company, Corvis Corporation (renamed Broadwing Corporation) in 1997, where he served as Chairman of the Board until Corvis was acquired by Level 3 Communications, Inc. in 2007 for $1.4 billion.

The crossing includes two stainless steel bridges over rail corridors. The bridges form an important pedestrian and cyclist link to the Waterfront that also connects three parks - Ordnance Park, South Stanley Park and the Fort York Grounds. History The project was first initiated in the early 2000s and was canceled for cost reasons. In 2014, the council approved the project procured as a Design-Build project directed by CreateTO, the City of Toronto's real estate and development corporation, with a budget of $19.7-million. The project was awarded to Dufferin Construction with a stainless-steel bridge project, the first of its kind in Canada. The project was completed in October 2019. Design The two bridges are constructed of a single stainless-steel arch rib of triangular shape utilizing standard hot-rolled stainless-steel plates that suspend the deck by a network arrangement of stainless-steel hangers. The arch ribs are titled outwards in opposite direction. The deck is a trapezoidal stainless-steel box girder with ribs on one side. The steel box is connected to a top concrete slab that uses stainless-steel reinforcement. The north bridge is a 52 m long through arch bridge, while the south bridge is a one-span arch connected to a V-shape pier on the south end to accommodate the 5 m elevation difference between the two ends. The South Bridge landing includes a 58 m long structural concrete ramp on the west side terminating in a cantilevered lookout on the east side. Construction Construction started in August 2016. The two bridge structures were hoisted into place by a 660-ton crawler crane in the summer and fall of 2018 and were completed in October 2019.

United States origins  Charles Joel Winton was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1862. His family later moved to Addison, NY, and he went to Princeton University, before moving to Wasau, Wisconsin in 1884. Once in Wasau, he invested money into various sectors such as land, rail, and oil, and in 1889, he began investing in forestry. In 1897, he and his wife Helen Smith Winton gave birth to David Judson Winton, and in 1899, they gave birth to Charles Joel Winton, Jr. The family moved to Minneapolis in 1909. After graduation, David Judson Winton also studied at Princeton University. His studies were interrupted by World War I, and before entering his final year of studies, he spent two years in the US Army with the American Field Service Ambulance Corps. He was deployed to France, where he was injured, and received the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart. After graduating from Princeton in 1920 he worked in logging camps before eventually moving back to Minneapolis. Once there he worked with his father Charles and his brother Charles Jr. at the Winton Companies, and eventually took over as the head of the Winton Companies. By the 1910s, forests in Wisconsin and Minnesota were running out of wood, and many of the lumbermen began moving to Canada to find new forests to harvest. In 1919, the Finger Lumber Company in The Pas, Manitoba suffered a barn fire at their sawmill, and David Judson Winton used this event as an opportunity to buy-out the company and shift his lumber operations to Canada.  Canadian operations  The assets acquired from the Finger Lumber Company included the mill facilities in The Pas, one tugboat, two steam barges, and of timber berths along the Carrot and Saskatchewan Rivers. The Wintons had also recently purchased a sawmill in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and decided to move the machinery from it to their larger operation in The Pas, which was renamed to The Pas Lumber Company. Throughout the 1920s, the company continued upgrading their facilities in The Pas and acquiring new timber berths. Within their first ten years of operating, they doubled their shipping capacity to four steamboats. So much wood was cut along the Carrot River that the river became impassable for ships in the springtime, and the company had to build roads along the river as an alternative mode of travel. In 1926, The Pas Lumber Company purchased the Red Deer Lumber Company, and began operating their sawmill on Red Deer Lake in 1928. Around this time, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) began building another rail line south from Hudson Bay Junction. Since much of the wood for their Red Deer Lake Sawmill had been cut upstream along the Etomami River, the company decided to build a new sawmill and a dam on the Etomami River at the base of the Porcupine Hills within the Porcupine Forest Reserve near to the new rail line. CNoR eventually built another rail line to this area from Crooked River, Saskatchewan. Therefore, the community that grew around the new mill was called Reserve Junction, because it was the only railway junction within the Porcupine Forest Reserve. An alternative source for the word junction in the name of the community is that the mill also sat at the junction of the Etomami and Pewei Rivers. Once the new mill at Reserve Junction was operational, the company shut down its mill at Red Deer Lake. The Pas Lumber Company continued to operate its mill at Reserve Junction until 1954, when the company opened a new mill in Prince George, BC. By 1958, its mill in The Pas had also closed so the company could focus its efforts in BC. Even though the company no longer had operations in The Pas, they continued to call themselves The Pas Lumber Company for several decades after the closure, but eventually renamed the company to Winton Global Lumber. Winton Global Lumber's BC operations were later sold to Sinclair Group (2/3 ownership) and Canfor (1/3 ownership). These companies continued to operate Winton Global Lumber until June 2008 when the US housing bubble popped during the Financial Crisis of 2007-08 and new home construction in the US ground to a halt.  Legacy  Sinclair Group's Engineered Wood and Prefabricated Home Divisions still use the Winton name.

The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Grace and is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia; it is owned and managed by the Mosteiro de S√£o Bento. It was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) in 1938. Location The Church and Monastery of Grace is located in the Gra√ßa neighborhood on a hill south of the Historic Center of Salvador, high above the Bay of All Saints. History O Sonho de Catarina Paragua√ßu by Manuel Lopes Rodrigues (1860‚Äì1917) The Church and Monastery of Grace is built on the site of a chapel built in 1535 of 1536 and dedicated to Catarina Paragua√ßu, the wife of Diogo √Ålvares (ca. 1475-1557), the castaway better known as Caramuru. Catarina Paraguass√∫ traveled to Europe and was baptized in France in 1528. She had Marian visions after her baptism in France and returned to Brazil to construct a simple chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Grace. She donated the chapel to the Benedictines on July 16, 1586. The Benedictines built an abbey adjacent to the chapel, known as the Abadia de Gra√ßa. Despite its present urban location, the chapel was located far from the city center of Salvador. Catarina Paraguass√∫ is interred at the church. The Church and Monastery of Grace, along with the demolished Se Cathedral and the Church of Victoria, are the earliest churches in Bahia. The Gra√ßa College (Col√©gio da Gra√ßa) was designed by Friar Greg√≥rio de Magalh√£es in 1645 and built between 1680 and 1717. The church has a tower with a bulb in the shape an orange, likely a remnant of Mozarabic architecture. The college was promoted to the status of monastery in 1694. The original chapel of the monastery fell into complete ruin during the 18th century. It was significantly altered or rebuilt in 1770. The Abbot In√°cio da Piedade Pinto added a baroque fa√ßade, enlarged the nave, added two lateral altars, and added gilding to the ceiling of the church. Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus painted the ceiling of the nave. In addition, Piedade Pinto renovated and restored the monastery, retaining only the tower with its orange-shaped dome. The painting of the nave's ceiling was altered in 1881 by Manuel Lopes Rodrigues. Part of the left arch was closed in 1924 for the construction of the Santa Teresa Chapel. Structure The Church and Monastery of Grace consists of a church with a single nave and a two-story monastery around a cloister. The church has an upper choir, tribunes, chancel, and a sacristy. The sacristy is located to one side with three entrance doors. The church has three altars; the central is dedicated to Our Lady of Grace, the right to Saint Joseph, and the left to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The image of Our Lady of Grace dates to the 17th century, and altered during a restoration in the 1930s. The church also has images of Saint Scholastica and Saint Benedict of Nursia. Manuel Lopes Rodrigues (1860-1917) completed several paintings in the church in the late 19th century depicting Catarina Paraguass√∫ and Caramuru. They include the ceiling paintings of the chancel and nave ceiling. Rodrigues also completed the painting O Sonho de Paraguassu in 1881. Protected status The Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Grace was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938. Both the structure and its contents were included in the IPHAN directive under inscription number 79.
