The so-called \\"Jeff School\\" was launched in 1944 as a successor to the party's New York Workers School, albeit skewed more towards community outreach and education rather than the training of party functionaries and activists, as had been the primary mission of its predecessor. Peaking in size in 1947 and 1948 with an attendance of about 5,000, the Jefferson School was embroiled in controversy during the McCarthy period including a 1954 legal battle with the Subversive Activities Control Board over the school's refusal to register as a so-called \\"Communist- controlled organization.\\" With the Communist Party in membership decline and financial chaos, the Jefferson School was forced to close its doors in 1956 in the face of government pressure. Institutional history Establishment The Jefferson School of Social Science was established by the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in 1943 as part of that organization's effort to expand the teaching of Marxism to the working class.Marv Gettleman, \\"Jefferson School of Social Science,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First Edition. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; pp. 389-390. Communists of the day believed that Marxism was a form of science which it believed was being willfully ignored in the public schools and sought to correct what it viewed as a systemic educational shortcoming. Moreover, the Communist Party sought to bolster community goodwill through its efforts as part of its Popular Front effort to integrate itself into American society. Unlike its predecessor, the New York Workers School, the Jefferson School was not focused upon the recruitment and training of new party members but was rather conceived as tool for more broad outreach into the community. The school did contain within it a more traditional apparatus for training of professional party cadres, however, an Institute of Marxist Studies which conducted a three-year program of study.David A. Shannon, The Decline of American Communism: A History of the Communist Party of the United States Since 1945. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1959; pg. 87. The Jefferson School was housed in a 9-storey building located at 575 Sixth Avenue in Lower Manhattan.Peter Filardo, \\"Guide to the Jefferson School of Social Science Records and Indexes: Historical/Biographical Note,\\" Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, New York University, New York, NY. The school was built around a library of 30,000 volumes and offered scores of classes each term covering history, politics, trade union affairs, ideology, and the sundry social sciences. In addition to \\"serious\\" topics, the Jefferson School added courses of a more whimsical or apolitical nature, including such topics as creative writing, art appreciation, health, interior decorating, and personal beauty on a budget.See: Gettleman in Encyclopedia of the American Left, pp. 389-390 and Shannon, The Decline of American Communism, pg. 87. Traditional lecture-based adult education was further supplemented by the Jefferson School's hosting of periodic public events, including single-admission lectures, workshops, musical concerts, and dramatic performances. Director of the Jefferson School was a former professor of philosophy at Brooklyn College, Howard Selsam. Instructors and school administrators were paid for their efforts, with funds coming at least in part from course registration fees. Growth At the time of its launch in 1943, about 2500 students attended courses at the Jefferson School of Social Science. Participation in the school doubled by the 1947/48 academic year, when attendance peaked at approximately 5,000. In addition to its main facility on Sixth Avenue, the Jefferson School also for a time operated satellite facilities, including two temporary schools in Harlem aimed at building African-American participation in the Communist movement ‚Äî the Harlem Leadership Training School and the Maceo Snipes School. These branch operations were primarily focused upon the radicalization of black students and their attraction to the Communist Party rather than the adult education orientation of the main branch of the Jefferson School. While the Jefferson School in New York City was the flagship of the Communist Party's adult education and party training schools, it was not the organization's sole enterprise. Other Communist Party schools during the middle part of the 20th century included the Abraham Lincoln School for Social Science in Chicago, the Samuel Adams School in Boston, and the San Francisco Labor School.Joseph R. Starobin, American Communism in Crisis, 1943-1957. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1972; pg. 25. Legal battle In 1949, FBI undercover agent/informer Angela Calomiris testified during the Foley Square trial that she took \\"educational courses\\" on communism at the Jefferson School and the New York Workers School. During the Second Red Scare of the early 1950s, the United States government attempted to identify, isolate, and discredit various so-called front groups of the Communist Party. Key to this process was mandatory registration of Communist-controlled institutions with the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB). The Jefferson School initially fought this requirement, an action which resulted in a 1954 legal case, Jefferson School v. Subversive Activities Control Board. An appeal dragged on to 1963, after the dissolution of the school. Termination From about 1953 the Jefferson School of Social Science had begun having trouble attracting enough paying students to cover the cost of its operations, forcing the Communist Party to assume an active role in subsidizing its operations.Shannon, The Decline of American Communism, pg. 359. This situation worsened as the decade progressed, with negative publicity associated with the school's legal difficulties and a growing popular hostility to Communism placing both the school and the party in an ever more difficult financial position. The February 1956 secret speech of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences,\\" had the effect of disorienting and discouraging the membership of the CPUSA. Shocked by Khrushchev's revelations of the mass crimes of the Stalin era, the party lost a spate of members and split into bitterly feuding factions who disagreed about the nature of the Soviet state and the path forward for American radicals. The Jefferson School played a part in this internal debate, sponsoring a series of four public meetings dealing with the importance of the soviet leader's revelations at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.Shannon, The Decline of American Communism, pg. 281. At the last of these sessions, John Gates, editor of the official party newspaper, The Worker, was sharply critical of the American party's blind obedience, its support of its Trotskyist opponents under the Smith Act, and its failure to commit itself to a peaceful path to socialism based upon maintained civil liberties.Shannon, The Decline of American Communism, pg. 282. The school became in its last year loosely associated with the Gates reform faction, which was opposed by a group favoring continuation of past practices, which included party leaders William Z. Foster, Eugene Dennis, and Gus Hall. With the Communist Party shattered and impoverished, the Jefferson School of Social Science terminated its operations in 1956, having been branded as a \\"Communist-controlled organization\\" by the SACB. Leadership According to investigation led by Benjamin Mandel of the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), the school's 1951 administration included Frederick V. Field as secretary and Alexander Trachtenberg as treasurer. According to a 1956 announcement of the school's closure, the school's administration comprised: Howard Selsam, director; David Goldway, executive secretary; and Doxey A. Wilkerson, director of curriculum. Legacy The bulk of the Jefferson School's papers resides at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University. Some eight linear feet of material is held in the New York University collection.

Title character Cliff Wettermark is down on his luck when he decides to rob a bank to help fix the things in his life that money can buy. Summary In Catherine, Mississippi, Cliff Wettermark has managed to burn bridges with several jobs including the Associated Press, the Times-Picayune, and a PR job for a chiropractor, and he now has a dead-end job as a reporter for the Catherine, Mississippi Call. Nothing seems to be going right in Cliff's life. He and his wife live in a hovel, he owes the bank $600, his wife needs her teeth fixed and he has what the local GP says looks cancerous on the side of his nose. When Cliff goes and visit's the office of the local bank manager to ask for an extension on his loan, while he's waiting he hears that a bank robber has just held up the drive-thru window of another bank and made off with $10,000. Cliff leaves to get the story, but he can't help but think of the thief's action in acquiring that much money. It went against everything in Cliff's experience with the process of securing money from a bank. After leading a sarcastic interview with a visiting Senator, he loses his job at the Catherine and his thoughts start to settle in about robbing a bank on his own. The reality of the act had opened his eyes to new possibilities. He knew that banks were and could be robbed but before now he had never considered doing it himself. He thought that only professionals who had the courage, skill and persistence could pull off such a thing. But he also knew that the local police wouldn't and couldn't do much boosted his confidence in getting away with it. Cliff mused that the town's captain of detectives: ::\\"He was able to make drinking a cup of coffee look as if the fate of the nation depended on it and this was the primary reason, if not the only reason, for his promotion to captain. He could not track an army tank in fresh mud.\\" So Cliff starts to stake out a bank in a town a few counties over and begins making his plans. Reviews Bill Pronzini stated that \\"Wettermark is by turns funny, sad, bitter, mordant, and ultimately as dark and unforgiving as Black Wings Has My Angel ‚Äî a brilliant character study that is likewise unreservedly recommended and that somebody damned well ought to reprint.\\" He called the title character Cliff \\"a tragicomic figure, accent on the tragic ‚Äî a tired, financially strapped, ex- alcoholic wage slave whose novelist ambitions have long since been shattered by rejection and apathy.\\" References Category:1969 American novels Category:Novels by Elliott Chaze Category:American crime novels Category:American mystery novels ","title":"Wettermark"},{"id":"37910091","text":"√ñnc√ºler is a village in the District of Ulus, Bartƒ±n Province, Turkey.

Since chemically inequivalent spins (i.e. nuclei not related by symmetry) are expected to also be magnetically distinct (barring accidental overlap of signals), and since an observed difference in chemical shift makes their inequivalence clear, the term magnetic inequivalence most commonly refers solely to the latter type, i.e. to situations of chemically equivalent spins differing in their coupling relationships. This situation can arise in a number of ways and can give rise to complexities in the corresponding NMR signals (beyond what a first-order analysis would handle) that range from the unnoticeable to the dramatic. Occurrence Two (or more) chemically equivalent (symmetry-related) spins will have the same chemical shift, but those that have a different coupling relationship to the same coupling partner are magnetically inequivalent by the coupling criterion. This occurs in molecules bearing two (or more) chemically distinct groups of symmetry-related nuclei, with just one element of symmetry relating them.If there were no symmetry relation among them, the nuclei would all be chemically inequivalent and therefore automatically magnetically inequivalent by the chemical shift criterion, showing as many signals as there are nuclei and with no additional complexity to the signal splitting. If there is more than one element of symmetry among them, the nuclei would all be chemically equivalent and therefore automatically magnetically equivalent by both the chemical shift and coupling criteria. A molecule may, of course, possess more than one set of magnetically inequivalent nuclei, related or not by additional symmetry elements that do not affect each. Most commonly, two chemically inequivalent pairs of hydrogen nuclei (protons) are involved, although other magnetically active nuclei will also show this phenomenon, and the spin system is often labelled an AA‚Ä≤BB‚Ä≤ system. Additional coupling partners may also be present, but it is the two A/A‚Ä≤ and B/B‚Ä≤ signals (at different chemical shifts) that are said to show magnetic inequivalence between the symmetry-related A and A‚Ä≤ (or B and B‚Ä≤) pairs at the same chemical shift. If the chemical shift difference (ŒΩA‚àíŒΩB) is large compared to the largest coupling constant, the spin system may be designated AA‚Ä≤XX‚Ä≤. Paired H-C-C-H fragments Magnetic inequivalence may occur with two symmetry-related HA-C-C-HB fragments (where the different subscripts indicate chemical inequivalence) that may or may not be contiguous. In order to distinguish the resulting coupling relationships, the symmetry-related pair would be labelled HA‚Ä≤-C-C-HB‚Ä≤. =ortho- Disubstituted benzenes= aromatic region (CDCl3, 300 MHz); starred peaks are from impurities H-3 and H-6 in any 1,2-homodisubstituted benzene are related by a mirror plane of symmetry bisecting the 1,2 and 4,5 C-C bonds. They are therefore chemically equivalent (and magnetically equivalent by the chemical shift criterion) but, because they have different spatial and connectivity relations to H-4 (with 3-bond vs. 4-bond couplings of different strengths), they are magnetically inequivalent by the coupling criterion. The same is true with respect to their coupling relationships with H-5. Similarly, H-4 and H-5 are chemically equivalent but magnetically inequivalent owing to their different coupling relationships with H-3 (or H-6). A classic example showing highly complex splitting is that of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The two signals are nearly mirror-symmetrical. In 1,2-diaminobenzene (ortho-phenylenediamine), the two signals have nearly the same chemical shift, so that the resultant signals form a complex multiplet. =para-Disubstituted benzenes= H-2/6 signal close-up (CDCl3, 300 MHz); the H-3/5 signal is identical H-2 and H-6 in any 1,4-heterodisubstituted benzene are related by a mirror plane of symmetry passing through C-1 and C-4. They are therefore chemically equivalent (and magnetically equivalent by the chemical shift criterion) but, because they have different spatial and connectivity relations to H-3 (with 3-bond vs. 5-bond coupling constants of different strengths), they are magnetically inequivalent by the coupling criterion. The same is true with respect to their coupling relationships with H-5. Similarly, H-3 and H-5 are chemically equivalent but magnetically inequivalent owing to their different coupling relationships with H-2 (or H-6). An example is provided by 4-nitroaniline. Although each signal retains the gross doublet shape predicted by first-order analysis, a close-up view of each reveals additional peaks. =Other aromatics= Any 4-substituted pyridine, pyridine itself, 1-substituted pyrazinium ion, diazine, 1-substituted or unsubstituted pyrrole and related aromatic heterocyclics (phospholes, furan, thiophene, etc.) as well as unsubstituted or 1-substituted cyclopentadienes and 1-substituted cyclopentadienides all have the same symmetry framework as para-disubstituted or ortho-homodisubstituted benzenes, and will present chemically equivalent but magnetically inequivalent pairs of protons. In heterocycles and in five- membered rings in general, however, 3J values can be significantly smaller than in benzenes and the manifestation of magnetic inequivalence may be subtle. The rarer seven-membered and higher ring systems may also show the same symmetry property, as can linked and fused aromatic ring systems such as biphenyls, naphthalenes and isoindoles. Similarly, 1-H benzimidazoles have the appropriate symmetry if N1-deprotonated or N3-protonated, or as a result of rapid tautomerization of the neutral form (for instance, in DMSO-d6) where the signals greatly resemble those of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. =Non-aromatic systems= The occurrence of symmetry-related pairs of HA-C-C-HB fragments is not limited to aromatic systems. For instance, magnetic inequivalence is found in 1,4-homodisubstituted butadienes. It might be expected in a molecule such as a symmetrical 2,3,4,5-tetrasubstituted pyrrolidine, but less rigid and less flat sp3 frameworks tend to show very weak long-range couplings (through 4 or more bonds) so as to not manifest much sign of magnetic inequivalence. Reich gives several additional examples of magnetic inequivalence in non-aromatic H-C-C-H pairs. H2C-CH2 fragments CH2 region (CDCl3, 300 MHz); starred peaks are from impurities Magnetic inequivalence may occur with H2C-CH2 fragments that are subdivided into two groups of two in either geminal relationships via a mirror plane along the C-C bond, i.e. HAHA‚Ä≤C-CHBHB‚Ä≤, or in vicinal relationships via a mirror plane bisecting the C-C bond, i.e. in HAHBC-CHA‚Ä≤HB‚Ä≤,Note that HAHBC-CHA‚Ä≤HB‚Ä≤ presents a mirror-related pair of diastereotopic hydrogens. Indeed, molecules with diastereotopic nuclei frequently show magnetic inequivalence. or via a rotational axis of symmetry (a C2-axis), i.e. HAHBC-CHB‚Ä≤HA‚Ä≤. The coupling constants then differ because of geometry (cis vs. trans) or connectivity (2-bond vs. 3-bond) and the level of complexity will depend on the differences. Conformational dynamics may reduce or even obliterate the difference between cis and trans couplings, if fast compared to the NMR timescale. There may also be additional couplings to other nuclei. The ethylene fragment in 2-substituted dioxolanes can thus show a high level of complexity if the substituent is large. Symmetrical norbornanes and similarly rigid compounds (e.g. 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) also show complex signals for the ethylene fragments, made more complicated by additional splitting by the bridgehead protons. Reich gives several additional examples of magnetic inequivalence in acyclic and cyclic systems containing H2C-CH2 fragments. With other nuclei Any pair of symmetry-related X-C-C-Y fragments (where X and Y are different magnetically active nuclei) as well as XYC-CXY (cis or trans) and X2C-CY2 fragments may show magnetic inequivalence when the heteronuclear coupling constants (2JXY or 3JXY) are non-negligible. In principle, the magnetically active nuclei may also be disposed on non- carbon atoms. A classic example is the 1H-NMR spectrum of 1,1-difluoroethylene. The single 1H-NMR signal is made complex by the 2JH-H and two different 3JH-F splittings. The 19F-NMR spectrum will look identical. The other two difluoroethylene isomers give similarly complex spectra. Appearance Whereas a four-spin AA‚Ä≤BB‚Ä≤ (or AA‚Ä≤XX‚Ä≤) system may have the requisite symmetry and coupling properties, its signals may show more or less complexity and, as with other coupling phenomena, the appearance of a signal from magnetically inequivalent nuclei will also depend on the instrumental field strength. A large number of such systems show less complexity, with fewer lines than is possible, particularly when the instrumental resolution is low, whence nearby peaks appear to coalesce, when JAB ‚âà JA‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤, when JAB ‚âà ‚àíJAB‚Ä≤, when JAA‚Ä≤ ‚âà JBB‚Ä≤ or when JBB‚Ä≤ ‚âà 0. The apparent complexity is also diminished in AA‚Ä≤XX‚Ä≤ systems when ŒΩA‚àíŒΩX >> JAX. This kind of simplication is enhanced as the instrumental magnetic field is increased, since the field- independent differences between coupling constants or between a coupling constant and zero appear proportionately smaller on the Œ¥ (ppm) scale, and since the field-dependent quantity (ŒΩA‚àíŒΩX)/JAX is magnified. In molecules of uncertain or otherwise unproven structure, the definitive appearance of complexity in a pair of signals, beyond what can be explained by first-order analysis of HC-CH pairs or H2C-CH2 fragments, can be taken to signify the presence of magnetic inequivalence and, therefore, of an element of symmetry aggregating them. Thus, the appearance of such complexity in the aromatic region of the 1H-NMR spectrum of the bis-(acetylacetonato)ruthenium complex of o-benzoquinonediimine served to prove its C2-symmetrical nature. Analysis Manual analysis of an AA‚Ä≤BB‚Ä≤ or AA‚Ä≤XX‚Ä≤ system is possible, if a sufficient number of peaks are detected. The A/A‚Ä≤ and B/B‚Ä≤ chemical shifts and the several coupling constants between each spin can be accurately obtained by quantum-mechanical simulationNote that NMR simulation is a term often erroneously used for NMR prediction, which proceeds from structure to predicted spectrum using databases of typical chemical shifts and coupling constants. of the spin transition probabilities, given a set of guessed chemical shift and coupling constant values, and subsequent refinement of those values by iterative spectral fitting.

Internationally he is considered to be one of the pioneers of Magnetic Resonance Imaging for clinical diagnostics. He is the Scientific Director of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Chairman of the Magnetic Resonance Development and Application Center (MRDAC) at the University Medical Center Freiburg. In the year 2003 he was awarded the Max Planck Research Award in the category of Biosciences and Medicine.  Biography   Scientific career  From 1969 to 1977 Hennig studied chemistry in Stuttgart, London, Munich and Freiburg. During the years from 1977 to 1981 he was employed as a scientist at the Institute for Physical Chemistry (IPC) of the University of Freiburg, where he completed his doctoral degree on NMR measurements of intramolecular exchange kinetics under the supervision of Herbert Zimmermann. During this time Hennig first came into contact with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at the inaugural lecture of his advisor Hans-Heinrich Limbach on the work of Paul Lauterbur, a subsequent winner of the Nobel Prize. From 1982 to 1983 Hennig was a post- doctoral student at the University of Zurich, where he worked in the area of CIDNP Spectroscopy. In 1982 he developed his first own NMR pulse sequence to measure intramolecular exchange processes. During his time in Zurich Hennig decided to focus his future work in the area of NMR method development with less focus on chemistry. Hennig began his work at the University Medical Center Freiburg in 1984 as a scientific researcher in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. There, in cooperation with the company Bruker Medizintechnik GmbH, he developed the RARE-Method. In the year 1989 he completed his professorial thesis of ‚ÄúSpecial Imaging Techniques for the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Tomography‚Äù at the Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg. In the year 1993, Hennig was appointed a professorship at the University Medical Center Freiburg as the head of the MR Tomography work group in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. In 1998 he was designated as the Director of the Department of Imaging and Functional Medical Physics of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. In 2001 he became Research Director of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. In the same year he founded the Magnetic Resonance Development and Application Center (MRDAC) at the University Medical Center Freiburg. A cooptation at the School of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Freiburg followed in the year 2002. In 2004 Hennig was appointed C4-Professor at the University Medical Center Freiburg and since then he is the Scientific Director of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology. The research group for research and development in MRI that he founded and headed since 1984 grew to approximately 80 employees by the end of 2012. In 1999 Hennig was the President of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM). Since 2008 he has been a joint affiliate to the Wisconsin Institute for Medical Research at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Since 2011 he has been a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.  Works  Hennig has written numerous fundamental research papers on the development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Based on the CPMG multi-echo method, Hennig developed the RARE Sequence (Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement) in 1984. Through his work the MR image acquisition time could be significantly reduced, which constituted an important step for its use in clinical routine. In addition, RARE offered the possibility to control the diagnostically relevant T2 contrast in MRI. The RARE method was first published in 1984 in the German journal ‚ÄúDer Radiologe‚Äù. His first submission to an international journal was rejected, with the comment that this method had already been tested and wouldn‚Äôt work. In the year 1986 international publications followed. RARE is currently one of the standard methods used in clinical MRI. The method is also known by the acronyms TSE (Turbo Spin Echo) and FSE (Fast Spin Echo). The Hyperecho method was published by Hennig in 2001. With hyperechoes the Specific absorption rate (SAR) of a RARE sequence can be significantly reduced while the image quality is almost completely maintained. This is important for clinical MRI applications at high magnetic field strengths. In 2008 Hennig published a concept for imaging with non-linear magnetic field gradients which allows increasing the image resolution in brain MRI in the outer image regions. He and his team also organize educative workshops under support of ESMRMB.http://www.esmrmb.org/cms/website.php?id=/en/lectures_on_mr/lectures_on_mr_courses_2015/inverse_imaging_sparse_sampling_compressed_sensing_and_more_.htm&template;=print  Connections to Asia  In the year 1985 Hennig travelled to Guangzhou, China in order to set up one of the first MRI systems in China. With this the first MR image was taken in China on December 25, 1985. Since then he has attended other MRI system installations in China. Hennig has been president and founding member of the European-Chinese Society for Clinical Magnetic Resonance since 1993. He is honorary member of the Chinese Radiological Society. Hennig was awarded ‚ÄúEinstein Professor‚Äù of the Chinese Academy of Science in 2011. In 2010 he received the Tsung Ming Tu Award, which is the highest scientific award of Taiwan. Since 2004 Hennig is a member of the Academy of Science of the Republic of Tatarstan. Furthermore, he maintains cooperations with Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.

David Kronke, writing in the Los Angeles Daily News, called the miniseries \\"thoroughly cheesy\\" and \\"flaccid.\\" The Seattle Post-Intelligencer opined that the effects work \\"[couldn't] overcome a barrage of ponderous dialogue and simply bland acting.\\"  Plot  Theodore Lytton is an avid geologist and paleontologist who is aided by his nephew Jonas Lytton, a Harvard graduate. Theodore seeks for ways to finance his undertakings, including illegal street fighting. After one of his lectures, Theodore is approached by Alice Hastings who finances the Lyttons journey into the center of earth on a quest to find her lost husband Casper Hastings. Casper had 7 years prior gone to seek a fortune of gold rumored to exist far below the earth's surface. The Lyttons meet McNiff, a gun for hire, in New Zealand. The Lyttons, McNiff, and Alice Hastings find their way miles underneath the earth's and reach an underground sea lit by a gaseous anomaly that provides light and life to this underground world. After traveling across the sea, the travelers encounter dinosaurs, 2 human settlements, and a humanoid reptilian species, the Solaroids, that may have evolved from dinosaurs. Alice is captured by the Solaroids. The group find Casper Hastings, who years prior discovered the humans, taught them English, and then endorsed a polygamist culture inducing a split in the human settlement. Casper Hastings is known as the 'School Master' in this newer polygamist settlement, while the more established human settlement endorses monogamy. There is friction between the human settlements and also with the Solaroids. Casper, joined by the Lyttons, free Alice from a Solaroid prison cell and return to Casper's settlement. There he reveals his plan to leave for the surface, with his wife and the Lyttons. McNiff decides to remain behind with the natives. Casper also reveals a mysterious plant with nearly magical healing remedies and intends to market it on the surface. The group of travelers, now joined by Ralna, a native tribeswoman for whom Jonas develops strong feelings, begin their journey to the surface. Casper is killed by the Solaroids before reaching the sea. The 4 travelers sail across the sea and begin to head back the way they came to the surface. Ralna, sensing danger, leaves in panic and is separated from Jonas. The Lyttons and Alice reach the surface through an underground vortex that feeds water to a lake on the surface. It is discovered the magical plant dies within a few hours of being on the surface. Weeks later, Theodore and Alice are engaged to wed while Jonas, who was previously engaged, leaves his fianc√©e to find Ralna in the underground world.

It was released as the first single from the group's sixth studio album, Kurutta Taiyou, on January 21, 1991 through Victor Entertainment. The single was released as an 8 cm CD in a cassette-like sleeve case that featured a re- worked version of the cover to Kurutta Taiyou. \\"Speed\\" peaked at number 3 on the Oricon music chart during the third week of 1991. The single has sold over 170,000 copies worldwide. Background, recording and release The song was written by vocalist Atsushi Sakurai and lead guitarist Hisashi Imai in 1990 shortly after the release of Buck-Tick's fifth studio album Aku no Hana for their then-upcoming sixth studio album Kurutta Taiyou. Initially, the song was titled \\"Acid\\"; however, the title was changed to \\"Speed\\" as the band deemed that titling \\"Acid\\" was \\"too risky\\", as Imai had been arrested for LSD possession after a concert during the group's tour for their fourth studio album Taboo in May 1989. \\"Speed\\", along with the single's b-side \\"Narcissus\\", was recorded on October 18, 1990 at Victor Studio in Tokyo during the recording sessions for Kurutta Taiyou. The song was released as the first single from the album on January 21, 1991, followed by its release as the first track on Kurutta Taiyou on February 20, 1991. In the liner notes to Kurutta Taiyou, the line \\"ii ashido\\" (good acid) was censored by the group's record label, Victor Entertainment. Sakurai has made references to this by whispering words for various drugs or not singing the line during live performances. Live performances Since its release, \\"Speed\\" has become a fan favorite and a live concert staple, being performed at most of the group's concerts since 1990. Though it has been performed less in recent years since 2010. During most live performances of the song, Sakurai will change the line \\"ii ashido\\" (good acid) and whisper the word \\"jouzai\\" (pill) as a reference to the line being censored in the album's original liner notes. Though during a live performance on the TV show Music Station in 1991, Sakurai held the microphone down to the audience during this part and mouthed \\"kokain\\" (cocaine) to the camera. Cover versions \\"Speed\\" has been covered by a number of other Japanese artists. It was covered by MCU from the pop/hip hop group Kick the Can Crew for the Buck-Tick tribute album Parade -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick- in 2005, as well as the visual kei rock band 9Goats Black Out on the compilation album Crush!: 90s V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs in 2011.

Born in Porto-Novo (a French protectorate in present-day Benin) to a wealthy father and a mother who belonged to the royal family of the Kingdom of Dahomey, he was sent to France for education at the age of 13. There he received a law degree, medical training, and served in the French armed forces as an army doctor during World War I. Following the war, Hou√©nou became a minor celebrity in Paris; dating actresses, writing books as a public intellectual, and making connections with many of the elite of French society. In 1921, he visited Dahomey for the first time since 1900 and upon returning to France became active in trying to build better relations between France and the colony. In 1923, he was assaulted in a French nightclub by Americans who objected to an African being served in the club; the attack changed his outlook on issues and he became more active in working against racism. He founded an organization and a newspaper with the help of other African and African Caribbean intellectuals living in Paris like Ren√© Maran, who was a Martinican (from a Guianese family), and traveled to New York City to attend Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) conference. Upon returning to France, Hou√©nou was considered a subversive by the French government, his newspaper went bankrupt, the organization he founded folded, and he was forced to leave France and move back to Dahomey. Following unrest attributed to him in there, he eventually relocated to Dakar, Senegal, where he continued to be harassed by the French authorities. He died from typhoid fever in 1936 while imprisoned in Dakar on contempt of court charges. Early life Marc Tovalou Qu√©num (name later changed to Kojo Tovalou Hou√©nou) was born 25 April 1887 in the city of Porto-Novo. Porto-Novo had become a French protectorate earlier in the decade and would become a key site of warfare between the French colonial empire and the Kingdom of Dahomey from 1890 until 1894. His father, Joseph Tovalou Qu√©num (d. 1925), was a successful businessman along the coast and his mother was a sister of the last independent king of Dahomey, B√©hanzin. Joseph was an active supporter of the French empire and believed it would greatly assist the economy of the region. He provided key support for the French empire during the Franco-Dahomean wars, was awarded the French medal of honor for his service, and became one of three African advisers to the French colonial administration. In 1900, Joseph took two of his sons to Paris for the Exposition Universelle or World's Fair and while there decided to enroll Hou√©nou and his half brother at a boarding school in Bordeaux. Hou√©nou finished boarding school and then earned a law degree with some medical training from the University of Bordeaux in 1911. He volunteered in August 1914 to serve as an army doctor in the French forces during World War I. Hou√©nou was injured in 1915 and honorably discharged from the military, relocating to Paris with a military pension. Paris and Dahomey Green: French Dahomey Lime: Rest of French West Africa Dark gray: Other French possessions Darkest gray: French Republic In 1915, Hou√©nou was given French citizenship, an extremely rare status in colonial Africa for people of African descent at that point with fewer than 100 being citizens of France by 1920. By 1918, he was admitted into the bar association and became a minor celebrity in Paris, with rumors of relationships (most notably with French actress C√©cile Sorel) published in the French papers. Hou√©nou became involved with the French intellectual scene and tried to be active as a public intellectual, including the 1921 publication of a scientific study of phonetics and linguistics titled L‚Äôinvolution des m√©tamorphoses et des m√©tempsychoses de l‚ÄôUnivers ‚Äì L‚Äôinvolution phon√©tique ou m√©ditations sur les m√©tamorphoses et les m√©tempsychoses du langage. In late 1921, Hou√©nou returned to Dahomey for the first time since he started his education in France in 1900. His father had been stripped of his position as advisor to the colonial government in 1903 and the French authority had a standing policy since about 1908 to limit his influence in the colony. Seeing the poverty that existed in the colony and particularly following the 1923 riots in Porto-Novo, Hou√©nou gradually grew increasingly critical of the French administration. At this point he limited his efforts to change French administration of colonies and not to end the French colonial structure. His interest in Dahomey led him to form the organization Amiti√© franco-dahom√©enne in 1923 in order to promote gradual reform of the French colonial administration. With this new focus, he changed the spelling of his last name from Qu√©num to Hou√©nou, went by his traditional name Kojo rather than Marc, and claimed the royal title of Prince. Although he was the nephew of B√©hanzin, the last independent king of Dahomey, his claims to be the Prince were dubious. Indeed, his claims to being the prince were directly challenged in the later Knowlton divorce case in the United States. After returning to France in 1923, Hou√©nou became the center of a large controversy regarding race in Paris. While having a drink at the El Gar√≤n nightclub in Montmartre, Hou√©nou was attacked by Americans who were angered by the presence of an African in the club. The club owner responded to the struggle by forcibly removing Hou√©nou and another person of African descent from the club. The situation became a scandal with the French press and the French government denouncing what they considered attempts by Americans to impose racial segregation in France. While denouncing the Americans, the French press elevated the status of Kojo significantly, referring to him in one incident as \\"a kind of colored Pascal.\\" Although prior to this point Hou√©nou had taken a limited role in promoting reform of the French colonial administration, the incident appeared to change his approach and he began to promote self-rule of African colonies on equal terms with France. Activism and repression After the El Gar√≤n incident, Hou√©nou became, in the words of historian Patrick Manning, the \\"most devastating African critic of the French colonial order.\\" Hou√©nou continued to support assimilation of Africans with French society, but now increasingly believed that assimilation could only happen if Africans had equal status. He began to argue that if Africans in the French colonies were not given equal citizenship and rights in the French empire that they should end the association and began self-rule. To further this cause, in 1924 he founded an organization called the Ligue Universelle pour la D√©fense de la Race Noire and using his connections with intellectuals of Paris founded the newspaper Les Continents with Ren√© Maran, with whom he had studied at Bordeaux. He visited the United States the same year to attend a meeting of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in New York City and to tour a number of other cities, including Chicago and Pittsburgh. Although he shared many of the aims of UNIA, Hou√©nou believed that France was largely an unprejudiced society that needed reform of colonial administration, but not the type of societal reform that UNIA sought in the United States. Hou√©nou said at the UNIA in 1924 that France \\"will never tolerate the prejudices of color. She considers her black and yellow children the equal of her white children.\\" Upon returning to France though, his involvement at the UNIA meeting was a cause for suspicion by the French administration which began considering him a radical (and also accused him of being a communist). The French colonial administration began surveillance of Hou√©nou's activities and treated Les Continents as a subversive publication. The Ligue Universelle pour la D√©fense de la Race Noire was so harassed by the surveillance of the French government that the organization folded in late 1924. A libel verdict in favor of Blaise Diagne against charges written by Ren√© Maran in Les Continents effectively bankrupted the newspaper and publication ceased in December 1924. After returning from the UNIA meeting in 1924, Hou√©nou was forced to leave France by the authorities and only allowed to reenter Dahomey in 1925 if he renounced the philosophies of Marcus Garvey, which he did. At the same time, he was disbarred in 1925 by the French bar association. His movement was closely watched by French authorities and he was arrested without cause on numerous occasions. In 1925, he was blamed for an uprising in Dahomey and was forcibly exiled by the French authorities from the colony. On a second tour of the United States in 1925, Hou√©nou was asked to leave a Chicago restaurant because of his race. When he refused, the waiter phoned the police and it resulted in a forceful ejection of Hou√©nou from the restaurant. The situation, with Hou√©nou arrested and his efforts to file a lawsuit against the police officers, was only resolved with the intervention of the French government. When leaving the U.S. at that point, Hou√©nou was accompanied by Zulme Knowlton, the French wife of Harry N. Knowlton, a wealthy engineer. Harry and Zulme were in the middle of a divorce at the time and in later alimony hearings, Harry and his lawyers claimed that he did not owe alimony because his wife had traveled with and entertained an African. The court rejected the claim. Death The later years of his life were spent in continued harassment and monitoring by French colonial authorities. Although he traveled to both Dahomey and France occasionally, he was not able to permanently settle in either because of the harassment. He met Roberta Dodd Crawford, a classical singer from Texas studying in Paris, and the two married in 1931. He spent much of his later years in Dakar, Senegal because he was exiled from both Dahomey and France on multiple occasions. He continued to be a focus for harassment and was arrested regularly without charge. He became active in Senegalese politics, mainly by organizing against Blaise Diagne, and campaigned unsuccessfully in the elections of 1928 and 1932. He was arrested on charges of contempt of court in July 1936 in Dakar and died of typhoid fever while in prison.

He then represented the United States as third under skip Augusto Perez in the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, where they finished fourth. McDonald became the skip of the United States wheelchair curling team in 2012, and led his team to a fifth-place finish in the world championship. He skipped the United States team at the 2013 World Wheelchair Curling Championship, and led his team to a fourth-place finish after losing in the semifinal to Canada's Jim Armstrong and losing a tight game to China in the bronze medal game. McDonald skipped the United States team at the 2014 Winter Paralympics, and finished tied for fifth after the round robin. He also skipped the United States team at the 2015 World Wheelchair Curling Championship. The United States team had a promising start, winning the first four of five games, but lost the final four games and finished in fifth place. Personal life McDonald grew up around sports as a child. He enlisted in the military, and was stationed in South Korea in 1991 when he was involved in an accident which left him paralyzed. After some complications, he recovered and began to undergo rehabilitation in California, competing in various sports, including wheelchair basketball, swimming, and golf. He also competed in shooting and table tennis in hopes of qualifying for the 2008 Summer Paralympics, but fell short. He then began curling, and moved from California to Wisconsin in 2011 after having shoulder surgery. He currently resides in Madison, Wisconsin with his wife and two children.

Formulated by Michael Posner, the task assesses an individual's ability to perform an attentional shift. It has been used and modified to assess disorders, focal brain injury, and the effects of both on spatial attention. Method Posner's spatial cueing task has been used to measure manual and eye-movement reaction times to target stimuli in order to investigate the effects of covert orienting of attention in response to different cue conditions. In the general paradigm, observers are seated in front of a computer screen situated at eye level. They are instructed to fixate at a central point on the screen, marked by a dot or cross. To the left and the right of the point are two boxes. For a brief period, a cue is presented on the screen. Following a brief interval after the cue is removed, a target stimulus, usually a shape, appears in either the left or right box. The observer must respond to the target immediately after detecting it. To measure reaction time (RT), a response mechanism is placed in front of the observer, usually a computer keyboard which is pressed upon detection of a target. Following a set inter-trial interval, lasting usually between 2500 and 5000 ms, the entire paradigm is repeated for a set number of trials predetermined by the experimenter. This experimental paradigm appears to be very effective in recasting attentional allocation.Bashinski H S, Bacharach V R (1980). Enhancement of perceptual sensitivity as the result of selectively attending to spatial locations. Perception & Psychophysics, 28(3):241-248. Endogenous and exogenous cues in the Posner Paradigm. Cues Two major cue types are used to analyze attention based on the type of visual input. An endogenous cue is presented in the center of the screen, usually at the same location as the center of focus. It is an arrow or other directional cue pointing to the left or right box on the screen. This cue relies on input from the central visual field. An exogenous cue is presented outside of the center of focus, usually highlighting the left or right box presented on the screen. An exogenous cue can also be an object or image in the periphery, a number of degrees away from the centre, but still within the visual angle. This cue relies on visual input from the peripheral visual field. Valid and invalid trials Posner devised a scheme of using valid and invalid cues across trials. In valid trials, the stimulus is presented in the area as indicated by the cue. For example, if the cue was an arrow pointing to the right, the subsequent stimulus indeed did appear in the box on the right. Conversely, in invalid trials, the stimulus is presented on the side opposite to that indicated by the cue. In this case, the arrow pointed to the right (directing attention to the right), but the stimulus in fact appeared in the box on the left. Posner used a ratio of 80% valid trials and 20% invalid trials in his original studies. The observer learns that usually the cue is valid, reinforcing the tendency to direct attention to the cued side. Some trials do not present cues prior to presenting the target. These are considered neutral trials. Some tasks use neutral trials that do present cues. These neutral cues give the participant an idea as to when the target will appear, but do not give any indication of which side it is likely to appear on. For example, a neutral cue could be a double-sided arrow.Posner M I, Nissen M J, Ogden W C (1978). Attended and unattended processing modes: the role of set for spatial location. In H.L. Pick and E.J. Saltzman (Eds.), Modes of Perceiving and Processing Information (pp. 137- 157). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. The comparison of performance on neutral, invalid, and valid trials allows for the analysis of whether cues direct attention to a particular area and benefit or hinder attentional performance. Since the participant is not allowed to move their eyes in response to the cue, but remain fixated on the centre of the screen, differences in reaction time between target stimuli preceded by these three cue conditions indicates that covert orienting of attention has been employed. Overt and covert attention In some studies using this paradigm, eye movements are tracked with either video-based eye tracking systems or electric potentials recorded from electrodes positioned around the eye, a process called electrooculography (EOG). This method is used to differentiate overt and covert attention. Overt attention involves directed eye movements, known as saccades, to consciously focus the eye on a target stimulus. Covert attention involves mental focus or attention to an object without significant eye movement, and is the predominant area of interest when using the Posner cueing task for research. By making 80% trials valid and 20% trials invalid, Posner encourages covert shifts of attention to take place in response to cueing. The ratio makes it beneficial for a participant to covertly shift attention towards the cued location, as it would be an accurate predictor for the majority of the time, giving rise to quicker target detection and response. When we attend to a location, even without directly looking at it, it facilitates processing and decreases the time we need to respond to information occurring in that given space. This results in decreased reaction times in Posner's spatial cueing task for validly cued targets, and slower reaction times in response to invalidly cued targets: \\"Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur\\" (Posner, Snyder & Davidson, 1980).Posner M I, Snyder C R, Davidson B J (1980). Attention and the detection of signals. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 109(2):160-174. Covert shifts of attention do not only decrease reaction time. They also result in more intense processing of stimuli,Prinzmetal W, McCool C, Park S (2005). Attention: Reaction time and accuracy reveal different mechanisms. Journal of Experimental Psychology-General, 134(1):73-91. and increase the probability of an individual detecting a near-threshold event occurring in the periphery (such as a slight lighting up of a box in the periphery, that may not have been noticed had attention been elsewhere). Stimulus onset asynchronies The time interval in between the onset of the cue and the onset of the target is defined as the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Previous studies using this spatial cueing task found that in addition to cue validity, behavioural reactions were also affected by SOA. The effect of the SOA varies depending on whether a central or peripheral cue is used.Posner M I, Cohen Y (1984). Components of visual orienting. In H. Bouma & D. G. Bouwhuis (Eds.), Attention and Performance X: Control of language processes (pp.531-556). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Experimental findings Variations of the Posner cueing task have been used in many studies to assess the effect of focal damage or disorders on attentional ability as well as to better understand spatial attention in healthy people. The following findings are only a few of the many results that have been established through the use of the Posner cueing task: * Attentional shift to a target area occurs prior to any eye movement * Spatial attention is not completely reliant on conscious visual input * There are three mental operations that occur during covert orienting: disengagement of current focus, movement to selected target, and engagement of selected target * Injury to areas of the midbrain and Parkinson's disease affect orienting ability in directions in which eye movements are impaired * Parietal lobe damage affects the ability to orient and detect targets from invalid trials (where targets are presented on the opposite site that is directed by the cue) * Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have slower reaction times in both valid and invalid trials than do typically developing children, especially to targets presented in the left visual field. Like typically developing children however, they performed better on valid trials than invalid trials. * It is mostly held that endogenous and exogenous visual spatial attention are subserved by strongly interacting, yet separable neural networks,Corbetta, M., Shulman, G.L., 2002.

Five sectors administer healthcare in Peru today: the Ministry of Health (60% of population), EsSalud (30% of population), and the Armed Forces (FFAA), National Police (PNP), and the private sector (10% of population). History In 2009, the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA) passed a Universal Health Insurance Law in an effort to achieve universal health coverage. The law introduces a mandatory health insurance system as well, automatically registering everyone, regardless of age, who living in extreme poverty under Integral Health Insurance (Seguro Integral de Salud, SIS). As a result, coverage has increased to over 80% of the Peruvian population having some form of health insurance. Health workers and access to healthcare continue to be concentrated in cities and coastal regions, with many areas of the country having few to no medical resources. However, the country has seen success in distributing and keeping health workers in more rural and remote regions through a decentralized human resources for health (HRH) retention plan. This plan, also known as SERUMS, involves having every Peruvian medical graduate spend a year as a primary care physician in a region or pueblo lacking medical providers, after which they go on to specialize in their own profession. Healthcare policy struggles In the years since the collapse of the Peruvian health sector in the 1980s and 1990s that was the result of hyperinflation and terrorism, healthcare in Peru has made great strides. Victories include an increase in spending; more health services and primary care clinics; a sharp spike in the utilization of health services, especially in rural areas; an improvement in treatment outcomes, and a decrease in infant mortality and child malnutrition. However, serious issues still exist.  Reducing the gap between the health status of the poor and non-poor  Despite measures that have been taken to reduce disparities between middle-income and poor citizens, vast differences still exist. The infant mortality rates in Peru remain high considering its level of income. These rates go up significantly when discussing the poor. In general, Peru‚Äôs poorest citizens are subject to unhealthy environmental conditions, decreased access to health services, and typically have lower levels of education. Because of environmental issues such as poor sanitation and vector infestation, higher occurrences of communicable diseases are usually seen among such citizens.Peru: Improving health care for the poor (1999). Additionally, there is a highly apparent contrast between maternal health in rural (poor) versus urban environments. In rural areas, it was found that less than half of women had skilled attendants with them during delivery, compared to nearly 90% of urban women. According to a 2007 report, 36.1% of women in the poorest sector gave birth within a healthcare facility, compared to 98.4% of those in the richest sector. Peru's relatively high maternal mortality can be attributed to disparities such as these.Borja, A. (2010). Medical pluralism in Peru‚ÄîTraditional medicine in peruvian society. In addition to allocating less of its GDP to health care than its Latin American counterparts, Peru also demonstrates inequalities in the amount of resources that are set aside for poor and non-poor citizens. The richest 20% of the population consume approximately 4.5 times the amount of health good and services per capita than the poorest 20%. Traditional and indigenous medicine A Curanderos performing a ceremony As of 2006, approximately 47% of the Peruvian population is considered indigenous. Many indigenous people continue to carry out medical practices utilized by their ancestors, which makes the Peruvian medical system very interesting and unique. In many parts of the country, shamans (also known as curanderos) help to maintain the balance between body and soul. It is a commonly held belief that when this relationship is disturbed, illness will result. Common illnesses experienced by the indigenous population of Peru include susto (fright sickness), hap‚Äôiqasqa (being grabbed by the earth), machu wayra (an evil wind or ancestor sickness), ura√±a (illness caused by the wind or walking soul), colds, bronchitis, and tuberculosis. To treat many of these maladies, indigenous communities rely on a mix of traditional and modern medicine.  Intersection of traditional and modern medicine  Shamanism is still an important part of medical care in Peru, with curanderos, traditional healers, serving local communities, often free of charge. One important aspect of Peruvian Amazon's curanderos is their use of ayahuasca, a brew with a long ceremonial history, traditionally used by the shaman to help in his/her healing work. With the introduction of Western medicine to many areas in Peru, however, interest in undergoing the training to become a curandero is diminishing, and shamans are innovating new avenues to use ayahuasca. Young individuals have increasingly been using the popular interest of tourists in the brew and its psychotherapeutic properties as a reason to undergo the training to become a curandero and continue the traditions. Curanderos, medicinal plants, and traditional medicine still have a place in the Peruvian healthcare system, even as biomedicine (Western Medicine) is made available and affordable for all, including rural communities. In fact, it's been seen that the continued use of traditional medical treatments is independent of access or affordability of biomedical care, in Peru and in many other indigenous regions in Latin America. There is a strong reliance on medicinal plant use within households, especially as a first response to a health emergency. Many households maintain a strong base of knowledge of medicinal plants, valuing independence in being able to address health emergencies, though the emphasis on maintaining this store of knowledge is decreasing. Studies show that Peruvian households, like ones in the Andean region near Pitumarca, and ones in the shantytown of El Porvenir near Trujillo, still prefer herbal treatments to the use of pharmaceuticals, particularly for specific cultural, or psychosocial illnesses. Though some preferred pharmaceuticals to household herbal solutions, because they are more effective, prescribed by doctors, and backed scientific research, others had many reasons for preferring traditional solutions. Reasons included a view that medicinal plants are more natural and healthy, are less expensive, and are able to treat cultural and regional illnesses outside the scope of biomedicine. One study also pointed to continued reliance on medicinal plants as a form of \\"cultural resistance\\"; despite biomedicine's domination over indigenous health systems, local communities use both in conjunction and perceive local remedies as both effective and a representation of cultural identity. With the emergence of biomedicine in these communities, they saw a valorization of traditional and local remedies as a response. In other instances, for example with childbirth, the government has played a larger role in pushing biomedical and technological services. This is in part due to development efforts and population politics, but these measures have been resisted, accepted, and modified by indigenous women. However, many Peruvians exercise \\"medical pluralism\\" in their health-seeking behavior, employing a combination of different health systems. For example, some women encouraged and coerced into going to the medical clinic for childbirth took the pharmaceutical pills prescribed with medicinal herbal tea. Western medicine and traditional medicine are not viewed as mutually exclusive, and instead are used complementarily, with households' often passing judgement on treatment they think will be most effective with each medical emergency.  Quality of health in indigenous communities  Indigenous populations in Peru generally face worse health risks than other populations in the country. One source of this issue is access to health facilities. Health facilities are often a large distance away from indigenous communities and are difficult to access. Many indigenous communities within Peru are located in areas that have little land transportation. This hinders the indigenous population's ability to access care facilities. Distance along with financial constraints act as deterrents from seeking medical help. Furthermore, the Peruvian government has yet to devote significant amounts of resources to improving the quality and access to care in rural areas. There is some debated as to whether traditional medicine is a factor in the quality of health in indigenous populations. The indigenous groups of the Peruvian Amazon practice traditional medicine and healing at an especially high rate; Traditional medicine is more affordable and accessible than other alternatives and has cultural significance. It has been argued that the use of traditional medicine may keep indigenous populations from seeking help for diseases such as tuberculosis, however this has been disproven. While some indigenous individuals choose to practice traditional medicine before seeking help from a medical professional, this number is negligible and the use of traditional medicine does not seem to prevent indigenous groups seeking medical attention. Government role and spending Peru‚Äôs health system is divided into several key sectors: The Ministry of Health of Peru (Ministerio de Salud, or MINSA), EsSALUD (Seguro Social de Salud), smaller public programs, a large public sector, and several NGOs. Infrastructure Ambulance in Pucallpa In 2014, the National Registry of Health Establishments and Medical Services (Registro Nacional de Establecimientos de Salud y Servicios Medicos de Apoyo - RENAES) indicated there were 1,078 hospitals in the country. Hospitals pertain to one of 13 dependencies, the most important of which are Regional Governments (450 hospitals, 42% of the total), EsSalud (97 hospitals, 9% of the total), MINSA (54 hospitals, 5% of the total) and the Private Sector (413 hospitals, 38% of the total). Lima, the capital city, accounts for 23% of the country's hospitals (250 hospitals).RENAES: Registro Nacional de Establecimientos de Salud y Servicios Medicos de Apoyo, \\"RENAES\\". Retrieved 23 October 2014.Global Health Intelligence, \\"Global Health Intelligence\\" . Retrieved 16 January 2015. MINSA According to its website, the mission of the Ministry of Health of Peru (MINSA) is to ‚Äúprotect the personal dignity, promote health, prevent disease and ensure comprehensive health care for all inhabitants of the country, and propose and lead health care policy guidelines in consultation with all public and social actors.‚Äù To carry out its goals, MINSA is funded by tax revenues, external loans, and user fees. MINSA provides the bulk of Peru‚Äôs primary health care services, especially for the poor. In 2004, MINSA recorded 57 million visits, or about 80% of public sector health care.Cotlear, D. (Ed.). (2006) MINSA offers a type of health insurance called Seguro Integral de Salud which is free to Peruvian citizens. EsSALUD EsSalud is Peru‚Äôs equivalent of a social security program, and it is funded by payroll taxes paid by the employers of sector workers. It arose after there was pressure during the 1920s for some kind of system that would protect the increasing number of union workers. In 1935, the Peruvian government took measures to study the social security systems of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. Following the study, EsSalud was formed in Peru.EsSalud: Seguridad Social para todos. (2012) Because private insurance covers just a tiny percentage of the citizens, programs such as MINSA and EsSALUD are crucial for Peruvians. EsSalud, however, is not completely free to Peruvian citizens, unlike Seguro Integral de Salud, which offers free basic healthcare. The cost of EsSalud is much cheaper than private healthcare options. Role of non-governmental organizations NGOs began appearing in Peru in the 1960s, and have steadily increased since then. The end of the violence associated with the Shining Path movement accelerated the growth of NGOs in Peru.Young, F., & Merschrod, K. (2009) Prevalent NGOs in Peru today include USAID, Doctors without Borders, Partners in Health, UNICEF, CARE, and AIDESEP. Such programs work with MINSA to improve infrastructure and make changes to health practices and insurance programs. Many organizations also work on the frontlines of healthcare, providing medication (including contraceptives and vitamins), education, and support to Peruvians, especially in poor or less accessible areas where the need is greatest. Such programs have helped the Peruvian government combat diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, and have generally reduced mortality and improved standards of living. Spending Relative to the rest of Latin America, Peru does not spend very much on health care for its citizens. 2004 reports showed that spending in Peru was 3.5 percent of its GDP, compared to 7 percent for the rest of Latin America. Additionally, Peru spent $100 USD per capita on health in 2004, compared to an average of $262 USD per capita that was spent by the rest of the countries in Latin America. However, Peru does spend more on healthcare than it does on its military, which differentiates it from many other Latin American countries. See also *Health in Peru References Bibliography *Borja, A.

The species grows to a maximum length of 180 cm, a weight of 15.0 kg, and is one of the most popular fish items on South African menus. Despite appearances it is not closely related to the eel family of Anguilliformes. Kingklip occur at depths from 50 ‚Äì 500 m, but usually in the range 250 ‚Äì 350 m. They are bottom-dwelling and inhabit rocky localities on the shelf and upper continental slope. Juveniles are more often found in shallow waters. They feed on dragonets, mantis shrimps, hake, squid, and various fish species. Spawning usually takes place from August to October. The species is oviparous, with oval pelagic eggs floating in a gelatinous mass. Their dorsal soft rays number 150, while the anal soft rays number 110. The head and body are normally pink to orange in colour, with dark blotches dorsally. Andrew Smith, the redoubtable Scots explorer and zoologist, first described the kingklip in 1847 from a specimen caught near the entrance to Table Bay and named it Xiphiurus capensis ('xiphos'=sword, 'oura'=tail). His description was published in \\"Illustrations of the zoology of South Africa\\", an account of the natural history objects he collected during his expedition into the interior of South Africa in 1834-36. It was also described by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1858 and named Hoplophycis lalandi.Fishwise Kingklip were heavily exploited in the 1980s, and populations have not yet recovered so that some precautions are in place. Being relatively slow-growing and long-lived, stocks cannot sustain the pressure of targeted fishing, and are taken only as a bycatch species. It is one of the economically important species to South African fisheries. The related species from New Zealand, Genypterus blacodes, has made its way to South African markets and is retailed as kingklip. Kingklip's lack of obvious scales has sparked lively and ongoing debate in Jewish circles as to whether it qualifies as kosher or treif. The South African Journal of Marine Science, in Volume 8, Issue 1 of 1989, published a description of the species' larval development in the southern Benguela Current. The distribution of kingklip larvae was studied over a 12-month period, and yielded data on spawning areas and breeding seasons. The researchers concluded that there are different spawning strategies for the western Agulhas Bank and the West Coast. On the Agulhas Bank, spawning is initiated by a decrease in sea surface temperature, whereas on the West Coast, spawning only occurs when upwelling has decreased i.e. between June and December. Females grow larger than males in both areas, but are slower growing. 'Genypterus' is derived from 'genyos' = face, jaw and 'pteron' = wing, fin FishBase References *Nielsen, J.G., D.M. Cohen, D.F.

It is located in the district of Gerc√º≈ü and the historical region of Tur Abdin. In the village, there are churches of Mor Aho and Mor Dimet, Mor Jacob, and Mor Barsaumo.The Monastery of Mor Barsaumo is also located north of the village. Etymology The Syriac name of the village is derived from \\"kafro\\" (\\"village\\" in Syriac) and \\"elayto\\" (\\"upper\\" in Syriac), thus Kafro \`Elayto translates to \\"upper village\\". This name serves to distinguish the village from Kafro Tahtayto (\\"lower village\\" in Syriac). History Amidst the Assyrian genocide, in 1915, Kafro Elayto was populated by 80 Assyrian families and 30 Kurdish families. After a five-day siege by a Kurdish force led by Yusuf Agha, most of the village's Assyrian population were massacred and their houses destroyed, and a few survivors fled to Inwardo. The Assyrians later returned, and roughly 60 Assyrian families are recorded in the 1980s, however, they were forced to flee due to the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict, and as of 2012 there are no remaining Assyrians. The village's remaining inhabitants are members of the Dek≈üuri tribe.

He is the editor of Wall Street Cina, a news organization focused on finance and geopolitics. He is also the maging director of StopSocial, a non profit association aimed at fighting the uncontrolled power of Silicon Valley's web giants. In 1999 he became a pioneer launching the internet media company Wall Street Italia, which he managed as Ceo and directed as editor in chief for 15 years, until he sold it in 2014. Two of his books are considered radically critical of the banking and global financial system. In September 2015 he published \\"Rimetti a noi i nostri debiti\\" (Guerini) (Forgive Us Our Debt) an essay on public debt which proposes a \\"QE For The People\\". In November 2013 \\"I padroni del mondo\\" (Chiarelettere) ‚Äú(Masters of The World ‚Äì How the Global Finance Elite Decides the Fate of Governments and Populations) quickly became a best seller with 5 printings in few weeks. Biography Luca Ciarrocca was born in Rome. His paternal family comes from Santo Stefano di Sessanio, in the province of L'Aquila, Abruzzi. He completed his professional education with a degree in Law at Universit√† La Sapienza, Rome, followed by a Master in Business Administration, with specialty in Finance, from the SAA (Scuola di Amministrazione Aziendale) in Turin. Career Luca Ciarrocca chose financial journalism as his career path and landed a post-MBA internship at Mondo Economico, the weekly magazine of Il Sole 24 Ore, his first full-time job. He became a licensed journalist and was nominated senior editor of Il Mondo, a weekly business and political magazine within the RCS-Corriere della Sera Group. Later he was selected to become correspondent in New York and moved to the US. In New York over the course of many years, he worked for several major Italian media outlets, including Il Giornale, ANSA, L'Espresso. He has also written for La Repubblica, Milano Finanza and The Street. He regularly appears as a financial, economic and political pundit on Italian television and radio programs, like RAI, Mediaset, SkyNews, La7 and other media. Online Financial News Ciarrocca came up with the idea for Wall Street Italia in New York during the summer of 1999 and the website was launched on October 11, during the golden season of the \\"new economy\\". The offices were on the 73rd floor of the Empire State Building in Manhattan. For a few years about 30% of Wall Street Italia shares were owned by HdpNet, the Internet holding company that belonged to the leading Italian publishing group RCS-Corriere della Sera. Following the withdrawal of Corriere della Sera from the business, as Chief Executive Officer and Editor in Chief, Ciarrocca practiced an unbiased and aggressive approach in the world of online business news. Traffic on the website grew during the years 2008-2011, along with financial crisis. Later more space was given to geopolitics and macro economy. On the morning of September 11, 2001, Luca Ciarrocca was the first in the world to give news of the Al Qaeda terrorist attack on the World Trade Center Towers. Ciarrocca sold Wall Street Italia in October 2014 to an Internet media company listed at the Milan Stock Exchange, choosing to remain independent and pursuing a career as macroeconomic author. Editorial opinion Luca Ciarrocca has strongly criticized Italy's government policy (Prime Ministers Berlusconi, Monti, Letta and Renzi, the last three not elected by popular vote in a political election) and the Italian party system; the dysfunctionalities of Europe and its currency, the Euro; the recessionary consequences of austerity measures and high taxation applied to cash-strapped countries with huge public debt like Greece, Spain and Italy - causing low economic growth and high unemployment through policies beneficial to other EU countries, especially for Germany; the unfairness and weakness of Brussels' internal mechanisms, such as the ESM (European Stability Mechanism) and the Fiscal Compact with their hidden and unbearable burden for the middle class of Mediterranean countries. Awards In 1997 he was awarded the \\"Premiolino\\" prize, the oldest and one of the most respected Italian journalistic awards, nominated by ANSA for \\"having beaten the powerful American news agencies on their own turf\\". In 2016 Ciarrocca was among the winners of 8th Amerigo/ENAM Journalism Award for the section Websites Published work The most recent book is \\"L'Affaire Soros\\" (Chiarelettere, 2019) a deep investigation on the billionaire philanthropy activist and the vast conspiracy theories spread against him by the antisemitic alt-right. In July 2018 Ciarrocca published \\"Intervista sulla Cina - Come convivere con la superpotenza globale del futuro\\" (Gangemi Editore), an economic and geopolitical analysis of the Asian superpower ambitions and its growing strength in dealing with the United States, Russia and Europe. \\"Rimetti a noi i nostri debiti\\" (Guerini) (Forgive Us Our Debt) is a 2015 essay on public debt which proposes a \\"QE For The People\\" (a new form of Quantitative Easing: central banks should give 'helicopter money' directly to taxpayers, not to commercial banks who are responsible in the first place for the economic and financial crisis). The most important book is considered \\"I padroni del mondo\\" (Chiarelettere, 2013) ‚Äú(Masters of the World ‚Äì How the Global Finance Elite Decides the Fate of Governments and Populations). A best seller with 5 printings, this essay is radically critical of central banks. It covers the financial crisis and monetary reforms, in particular the proposal by the UK organization Positive Money for fixing the dysfunctional global banking system. Ciarrocca's first book was in 2001 \\"Investire in tempo di guerra\\" (Investing in Times of War), Edizioni Nutrimenti.

The monument was built in 1877, during his lifetime. It was the first statue to be erected in Bismarck's honour.  History  In 1877, the Committee for the Erection of a Statue of the German Chancellor Bismarck in Kissingen (Comit√© f√ºr die Aufstellung einer Statue des deutschen Reichskanzlers F√ºrst Bismarck in Kissingen), founded in 1875, commissioned the artist, Heinrich Manger, to create a Bismarck monument. The erection of a statue to a living person required the permission of the Bavarian king. In giving his approval, King Ludwig II of Bavaria, directed that the monument should not be located at the spot where an assassination attempt on Bismarck had been carried out in 1874, but rather near the Untere Saline (\\"Lower Saltworks\\") on the Franconian Saale river, where Bismarck had relaxed during his cures. The majority of the cost of the statue, amounting to 7,800 Mark, was covered by contributions collected by spa guests.Sieglinde Seele: Lexikon der Bismarck-Denkm√§ler. Michael Imhof, Petersberg 2005, pp. 227f. The monument's unveiling, on Sunday 29 April 1877 at 10 o'clock, was covered in detail by the local newspaper, the Saale-Zeitung. Chancellor Bismarck expressed his gratitude in a telegramme during the formal dinner at the Englischer Hof, during which master builder, Manger, Privy Councillor, Dr. St√∂hr, and the Lord Mayor, Dr. Full, gave speeches honouring Emperor William I. Nevertheless, Bismarck probably never saw the monument himself because, as he said in a speech on 28 November 1881, he would be highly embarrassed to pass by his own statue. In addition, he said it would have disturbed him \\"to stand next to himself like a fossil\\". The monument, which inspired the design of the Bismarck Monument in Cologne, amongst others, had to be galvanised with a layer of bronze for reasons of durability shortly before Bismarck's 100th anniversary in 1915. This was carried out by the W√ºrttembergische Metallwarenfabrik in Geislingen an der Steige.  Further reading  * Denis A.

It was first lit in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and has been erected and lit every year since. The Menorah has grown in size as well, and is now high. History In 1974 Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for the public awareness of the festival of Hanukkah and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs. Although initially criticized by liberal Jewish organizations, Schneerson defended the campaign. In 1979, Abraham Shemtov of Chabad, sought to erect a menorah on the White House lawn. Cecil D. Andrus, the secretary of interior initially denied Shemtov a permit to put a menorah on government property, saying it would violate the First Amendment. Stuart E. Eizenstat eventually settled the matter and a permit was granted. That year, President Jimmy Carter ended 100 days of self-imposed seclusion over the Iran hostage crisis by walking to Lafayette Park, and lighting the Menorah erected there by Chabad. Carter delivered brief remarks. Every president since has recognized Hanukkah with a special menorah- lighting. President Ronald Reagan is credited with naming it the National Menorah in a statement read during the menorah-lighting in Lafayette Park in 1982. As of 2013, the Menorah was high, and rested on an elevated platform high. The height of the hanukiah and platform are regulated by rabbinical law, which requires the menorah to be both visible (minimum height off the ground) and of a maximum height (a person must look upward but not uncomfortably so). Event The Menorah is erected each year by Abraham Shemtov and Levi Shemtov and sponsored by American Friends of Chabad-Lubavitch, as part of the campaign initiated by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson to raise awareness and hold public Hanukkah celebrations. The National Menorah annual event is broadcast by C-Span each year. It includes a music presentation of festive Hanukkah songs by the United States Army Band. A U.S. ambassador or member of the cabinet has participated in the Menorah lighting each year. In 2004, all 50 U.S. governors issued proclamations in honor of the National Menorah. Scholars have cited this initiative as a prime factor in Hanukkah becoming a widely celebrated festival.http://www.temple- israel.com/component/content/article/8-frontpage/952-the-hanukkah-menorah- becomes-a-national-american-phenomenon?tmpl=component&type;=raw Dignitary kindlers President Jimmy Carter (right) at first Hanukkah menorah lighting in 1979.

CPF was initially developed to explain how red-winged blackbirds might maximize energy returns when traveling to and from a nest. The model has been further refined and used by anthropologists studying human behavioral ecology and archaeology.  Case studies   Central place foraging in non-human animals  Orians and Pearson (1979) found that red-winged blackbirds in eastern Washington State tend to capture a larger number of single species prey items per trip compared to the same species in Costa Rica, which brought back large, single insects. Foraging specialization by Costa Rican blackbirds was attributed to increased search and handling costs of nocturnal foraging, whereas birds in Eastern Washington forage diurnally for prey with lower search and handling costs. Studies with sea birds and seals have also found that load size tends to increase with foraging distance from the nest, as predicted by CPF. Other central place foragers, such as social insects, also show support for CPF theory. European honeybees increase their nectar load as travel time to nectar sites from a hive increases. Beavers have been found to preferentially collect larger diameter trees as distance from their lodge increases.  Archaeological case study: acorns and mussels in California  To apply the central place foraging model to ethnographic and experimental archaeological data driven by middle range theory, Bettinger et al. (1997) simplify the Barlow and Metcalf (1996) central place model to explore the archaeological implications of acorn (Quercus kelloggii) and mussel (Mytilus californianus) procurement and processing. This model assumes foragers are gathering resources at a distance from their central place with the goal of efficiently returning the resource home. Travel time is expected to determine the degree to which foragers will process a resource in order to increase its utility prior to returning from a foraging location to their central place. Transport capabilities in aboriginal California were established by measuring the volume of burden baskets and extrapolating the load weight based on ethnographic data on basket use. Ethnographic and experimental data was used to estimate utility at each possible stage of processing. Examining ecology and procurement methods, the central place foraging model was used to predict the conditions in which field processing of the two species will occur. * Acorn: Most stages of acorn processing are extremely time consuming but only marginally increase utility, therefore the central place foraging model predicts that acorns should only be dried prior to transporting to central place. Further processing of acorns (cracking, shucking, and winnowing) increases efficiency only when foragers‚Äô one way travel time reaches 25 hours. This corresponds to approximately 124.75 km, which exceeds the territory size of native groups in California dependent on acorns. * Mussels: When foragers employ the plucking harvesting method, field processing is expected even with short travel distances, as the shell to meat ratio allows forager to increase efficiency by removing shell. Stripping will almost always result in central place processing, rather than field processing, as this harvesting method results in the procurement of a high percentage of small mussels with high shell to meat ratios. An understanding of central place foraging has implications for studying archaeological site formation. Variability of remains at sites can tell us about mobility ‚Äì whether or not groups are central place foragers, what resource they‚Äôre mapping on to, and their degree of mobility. Based on central place foraging application for the processing of mussels and acorns, Bettinger et al. (1997) make several predictions for archaeological expectations. The study shows that procurement with field processing is more costly compared to foraging and processing resources residentially. These results imply that highly mobile foragers will establish a home base in close proximity to staple resources, and all processing of those resources will be done residentially. Less residentially mobile populations would in turn be mapped only onto a few resources, and would be expected to field process non- local resources on logistical procurement forays at greater distances from their central place. Processing debris from archaeological sites should reflect changes in mobility. * Acorns: Sites where the archaeobotanical remains are dominated by acorn can be assumed to be seasonal sites of highly mobile foragers that have mapped on to acorns for seasonal processing. Sites that have a mix of archaeobotanical remains with a decreased abundance in acorn remains and plant material that would be lost in early stages of field processing are interpreted as less residentially mobile settlements characterized by logistical procurement. * Mussels: Interpretation of archaeological mussel shell is complicated because it is reliant on the condition of the mussel beds, distance to the mussel beds and the type of harvest method being employed. In general, however, sites closer to mussel beds should have larger mussel shell due to plucking and residential consumption. Sites far from mussel procurement beds would be expected to have a mix of mussel shell sizes due to stripping. The presence of higher amounts of small mussel shell could also indicate an increase in resource intensification.  Archaeological case study: silver miners and propaganda in Colorado  Glover (2009) used a CPF model to determine if late nineteenth century silver miners near Gothic, Colorado were choosing mine locations efficiently given the costs of transporting silver ore to the mill, the value of silver, and the amount of silver per kilogram of ore. Estimates of the costs associated with transport were obtained using research from physiology to determine the most energetically efficient load size. Newspaper articles were used to determine the hourly wage that a miner could be making if they worked in town instead. Newspapers were also used to estimate the value of silver at that time, and estimates of the amount of silver per kilogram of ore were obtained through records from area silver mills, as well as through newspapers. These differed, with the newspapers optimistically claiming that silver deposits were far more productive than the more accurate mill records demonstrated. These estimates were used to determine the optimal placement of mines. A number of historic mining locations were recorded using GPS. These data were used to calculate least cost paths from the mines to Gothic, which provided the distances to the central place. The results were compared to two different CPF models based on newspaper propaganda and the more realistic mill records, respectively. Miners were choosing locations that were much farther away than feasible given the value of silver and its actual abundance. However, the mines were within the distance predicted using the optimistic newspaper estimates. Glover suggested that miners, being new to the area, used social learning strategies and based their decisions on newspaper propaganda and rumors, rather than individual experience. Therefore, they chose locations that were too far away to be economically viable.  Ethnographic case study: shellfish in Torres Strait Islands  Shellfish exemplify the resources targeted by the CPF model ‚Äì those with a heavy, bulky, low utility component (e.g. shell) surrounding a smaller, lighter high utility component (e.g. meat). If foragers differentially field process and transport shellfish prey items, analyses of midden composition may incorrectly estimate the importance of some species and their relative contribution to prehistoric diets. Using foraging data from the Meriam of Australia, Bird and Bliege Bird (1997) compare observed shellfish field acquisition to shell deposition at residential sites, and test the hypotheses of the CPF model. The Meriam inhabit Torres Strait Islands of Australia, are of Melanesian descent, and have strong cultural and historical ties to New Guinea. They continue to harvest marine resources such as sea turtles, fishes, squid, and shellfish. Bird and Bliege Bird conducted ‚Äúfocal individual foraging follows‚Äù of 33 children, 16 men and 42 women during intertidal foraging bouts on reef flats and rock shores. Foraging technology includes 10- liter plastic buckets, long- blade knives, and hammers. Foragers are constrained by time (2‚Äì4 hours at low tide) and load size (10-liter bucket). Large clams (Hippopus hippopus and Tridacna spp.) collected on the reef flat constitute over half of the edible weight collected, but since they are almost always field processed their shells make up only 10% of the residential site deposition. In contrast, sunset clams (Asaphis violascens) and nerites (Nerita undata) are usually processed residentially. Large clams were, therefore, underrepresented while small clams and nerites were overrepresented in the reconstructed diet. Since reef flat and rocky shore foraging occurs at multiple sites at variable distances from the residential camp, the authors calculated the mean one-way travel distance processing threshold (z_{d1}, in meters) for each species. The CPF model accurately predicts field processing for the majority of reef flat foraging events for bivalves. Hippopus and Tridacna have small processing threshold distances (z_{d1} = 74.6 and 137 respectively), and no shell is returned to camp at distances beyond 150 meters. Women‚Äôs fit nears 100%, but children and men made the optimal choice less frequently because they usually forage for shellfish opportunistically, and therefore do not always carry the appropriate processing technology. For gastropods (Lambis lambis, z_{d1} = 278.7), the model accurately predicts processing only 58-59% of the time. This could in part be due to a preference for cooking some species inside of their shells (i.e. the shell has some utility), or also because some prey items are prepared at ‚Äúdinner-time camps‚Äù rather than the residential camp. A. violascens and N. undata are never field processed, consistent with their large processing threshold distances (2418.5 and 5355.7 respectively). Overall, prey types that were difficult or inefficient to process and/or were collected near the residential or temporary camp were not field processed. Species that required little processing time to increase returns and/or were collected far from camp were field processed. The field processing predictions of the CPF model might be incorrect where shellfish are transported whole in order to maintain freshness for later consumption or trade, or where the shell itself is valuable.  Ethnoarchaeological case study: pickleweed and pi√±on  Barlow and Metcalfe (1996) address the issues of field processing of plant materials. Decisions of central place foragers may confound archaeological interpretations about the contribution plant material to the diet. Two interrelated issues are pertinent: the location of the central place, and field processing. Barlow and Metcalfe study archaeological materials from two sites, Danger Cave and Hogup Cave, in the area of the Great Salt Lake. These sites contain evidence for the use of pi√±on pine (Pinus monophylla) and pickleweed (Allenrolfea occidentalis). Samples were obtained for experimental processing from extant pi√±on groves and pickleweed patches in the vicinity as the cave sites. Pi√±on and pickleweed were harvested and processed in carefully timed and controlled stages. After each stage the useful, i.e. edible, portion of the remaining material was weighed and recorded before proceeding to the next stage. Stages consisted of: gathering, drying, and a variety of processes (parching, hulling, winnowing, etc.) to remove inedible constituents. Caloric values of the samples were then determined via laboratory analysis. These values, as well as assumed load sizes from 3 to 15 kg (based on ethnographic burden basket sizes) were then used to generate field processing model predictions. At a distance of 15 kilometers from the central place, the estimated net return rates for field processing loads of pi√±on and pickleweed are 3,000 and 190 calories per hour, respectively. Since pi√±on has higher overall return rates, field processing produces a higher rate of return. Because pickleweed has a lower rate of return, it is not worthwhile to spend the additional effort required for field processing. Therefore, the central place will be situated closer to pickleweed patches than to pi√±on in order to more effectively exploit the lower-ranked resource. These results imply that the archaeological evidence for pickleweed at the cave may over estimate its actual contribution to the diet. If foragers choose to reside closer to pickleweed patches and bring back largely unprocessed plants, a high density of pickleweed macrofossils will be incorporated into site deposits. However, the opposite is true for pi√±on, which is largely processed in the field. Thus, most sites will contain little macrofossil evidence of the inedible portions of pi√±on that could later be recovered by archaeologists. As such, the relative abundance of macrofossils in most cases does not directly translate into the relative contribution of those resources to the diet of central place foragers.  The model   Basic math: single stage of processing  The effect of flattening the utility curve, U(t) whilekeeping constant procurement and processing times (x_0,x_1). When the difference between field processing and transporting whole items (y_1,y_0) is reduced, we should expect an increase in the transport time atwhich processing will occur. A forager should process items when transport time from a central place exceeds this threshold. (Adapted from Metcalfe and Barlow 1992.) The goal of the field processing model is for a forager to maximize its return rate per roundtrip from home base to patch. The model typically solves for some amount of travel time that makes it worthwhile to process a resource to a certain stage. To determine this, we need to relate the benefit of processing and the time spent processing to the travel time. We let z= point on transport-time axis where field processing become profitable x_0= time to procure unprocessed resources x_1= time to procure and process a load of resources y_0= utility of load without field processing y_1= utility of load with field processing The relationship is then specified by: z=\\\\frac{y_0x_1-y_1x_0}{y_1-y_0} With values for the utility and time of processed (y_1,x_1) and unprocessed loads (y_0,x_0), we can solve for z. The right hand side of the equation is the proportion of relative utility*time to utility. Two conditions must be satisfied. First, the processed load must have higher utility than the unprocessed load. Second, the return rate of the unprocessed load must be at least as good as the return rate for the processed load. Formally, # If x_1>x_0 then y_1>y_0. # If y_0, then \\\\frac{y_0}{x_0}\\\\geq\\\\frac{y_1}{x_1}.  Multiple components and multiple stages of processing  Many resources have multiple components that can be removed during processing to increase utility. Multistage field processing models provide a way to calculate travel thresholds for each stage when a resource has more than one component. As one increases the utility per load, the time needed to procure a complete load increases. The benefit of each stage of processing is: y_j=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i\\\\in s_j}A_iB_i}{\\\\sum_{i\\\\in s_j}B_i} where A_j=utility of resource component j B_j=proportion of package composed of resource component j prior to processing y_j=utility of load at field-processing stage j The cost in terms of time for each stage of processing is: x_j=\\\\left(\\\\frac{L}{P\\\\sum_{i\\\\in s_j}B_i}\\\\right)\\\\left(M+\\\\sum_{i otin s_j}D_i\\\\right) where D_j=time required to remove resource component j L=weight of optimal load size for transport P=weight of unmodified resource package M=time required to handle each resource package x_j=total handling and processing time required to reach each stage j of processing Now these values can be used to calculate z_j, which is the travel threshold for processing to stage j. In addition to a resource with multiple components, this same model generalizes to a resource with multiple stages, each of which is composed of multiple resources, each of which can be removed independently of each other (i.e., with no additional cost). This model can be further generalized to the case where multiple components with additional costs can be removed in multiple stages of processing through recursion.  Assumptions  thumbTransport decay curves demonstrate the reduction in return rates (cal/hour) experienced by a central place forager as a function of round trip travel time. The travel threshold from field processing models, z_j represents the travel time at which processing to the next stage will provide higher return rates, which is indicated by the intersection of the decay curves for two sequential stages of processing. The shaded areas represent the optimal extent of processing as travel time increases. This model rests on a number of assumptions. The most important are listed here. * Individuals attempt to maximize their rate of delivery per round trip * Packages have at least two components with different utilities * The optimal load size is less than or equal to the resources available * Time spent away from camp comes with an opportunity cost, but time spent in camp does not. So there is no cost to processing in camp.  Predictions  There are three key predictions from the field processing model. # The amount an individual is willing to process is proportional to traveling time. This is evident in x_0 and x_1 in the equation above. Since x_1 is the amount of time it takes an individual to process something to an additional stage, and this is independent of the amount of time it takes one to initially procure the resources, and since x_1 is positive, then increasing it will result in an increase in z. # If processing results in a greater benefit, then one will not need to travel as far to make processing worthwhile. This is clear to see because, as long as condition 2 holds, y_1 is larger than y_0. So that part of the equation will be negative. Therefore, if we hold everything else the same and increase the benefit due to processing, the travel time required to make processing viable will decrease. # Field processing can increase the amount of time that an individual is willing to pursue a prey. If processing a prey item results in a big enough benefit, you will spend longer capturing it. We can see this by looking at where x_0 is in this model. Since it interacts with the benefit due to processing, a change in either of those can alter z. Transport decay curves demonstrate the reduction in return rates (cal/hour) experienced by a central place forager as a function of round trip travel time.

Its 14 schools serve 5,360 students as of the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. History The history of public education in Bladen County really began shortly after the state passed its first common school law in 1839. The state was then divided into several school districts. In August of that year, voters in Bladen County approved a measure establishing a school system in the county. The system started growing and by 1900 there were 11 schools functioning in the county. By the 1966‚Äì67 school year, the segregated Bladen County Schools was operating nine schools for black students and eight schools for white students. Integration and school consolidation movements developed that year and by 1971, the system was fully integrated. Student demographics For the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, Bladen County Schools had a total population of 5,360 students and 359.92 teachers on a (FTE) basis. This produced a student-teacher ratio of 14.89:1. That same year, out of the student total, the gender ratio was 51% male to 49% female. The demographic group makeup was: Black, 42%; White, 41%; Hispanic, 12%; American Indian, 1%; and Asian/Pacific Islander, 0% (two or more races: 4%). For the same school year, 75.80% of the students received free and reduced-cost lunches. Governance The primary governing body of Bladen County Schools follows a council‚Äìmanager government format with a nine-member Board of Education (also called the Bladen County Public School Board) appointing a Superintendent to run the day-to-day operations of the system. The school system currently resides in the North Carolina State Board of Education's Fourth District.

After playing for the Napoli Primavera side in the club's youth system, he made his professional debut for the club's senior side under manager Walter Mazzarri in the Europa League on 6 December 2012, in a 2‚Äì0 home defeat against PSV Eindhoven; his first appearance in Serie A came on 13 January 2013, as he appeared as a very late substitute in a 3‚Äì0 home win against Palermo. On 22 July 2013 he was sent on loan from Napoli to Perugia, at the request of the club's coach, and former Napoli striker, Cristiano Lucarelli. In August 2014, he was sent on loan from Napoli to Reggina. On 15 July 2015, both Insigne and his young Napoli attacking teammate Gennaro Tutino were sent on loan to Avellino with an option to buy. On 12 January 2017, Insigne was sent on loan from Napoli to Serie B side Latina, where he was assigned the number 9 shirt. On 23 July 2017, it was announced that Insigne would be loaned to newly promoted Serie B side Parma for the 2017‚Äì18 season. On 21 July 2018, Insigne joined with Serie B side Benevento on loan until 30 June 2019. On 23 June 2019, Insigne signed permanently with Serie B side Benevento. International career At international level, Insigne has represented the Italy U-18, U-19, and U-21 sides. Style of play Regarded as a talented and promising prospect, Insigne is a diminutive, quick, creative, and skilful left footed forward, with good technique, an eye for goal, and a small, slender physical build, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line. Due to his ability to both set up and score goals, he usually plays in a free role as a second striker, which allows him to operate on either flank or in the centre of the attacking third, although he frequently also plays as a right winger, a position which allows him to cut into the centre and curl shots on goal with his stronger left foot. He has also been deployed as an attacking midfielder, or as a main striker on occasion. Personal life Roberto is the younger brother of footballer Lorenzo Insigne, who plays for Napoli. His oldest and youngest brothers, Antonio and Marco, also play football, in the Italian amateur divisions. Roberto Insigne is married to Elisabetta; their daughter, Patrizia, was born on 22 November 2016.

Tyrrellspass castle Early life He was probably born in Spain in 1545, the son of Phillip Tyrrell and his Spanish wife. As head of the Tyrrell family he became the Lord of Fartullagh, a barony in south Westmeath based on the village of Tyrrellspass, a position the Tyrrells had held since the time of Henry II. He saw military service for the English-backed Crown forces in Ireland but was falsely accused in 1565 by the Earl of Kildare of the murder of Garrot Nugent, son of the Baron of Delvin. As a result, he subsequently allied himself with the Irish cause. Battle of Tyrrellspass During the Nine Years War, which commenced in 1594, he became a commander of the rebel forces in Leinster under Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In 1597 the Crown forces commenced a new campaign, involving a three-pronged attack on Ulster, aiming to link up in Ballyshannon. One force under Robert Barnewall, with 1000 men from the Pale, was ambushed by Tyrrell, with 300 men, and his fellow commander Piers Lacy at Tyrrellspass. The Crown forces were cut to pieces with few survivors. Tyrrell was afterwards made Colonel General of O'Neill's forces in Munster. Later life In 1600, Lord Mountjoy was sent to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth to quell the rebellion. He besieged Tyrrell at his headquarters at \\"Tyrrell‚Äôs Island\\", the exact location of which is not known. Tyrrell escaped and joined O'Neill in Ulster. The rebels later headed south to join up with a Spanish army landing at Kinsale in County Cork, but were defeated in 1601 by Crown forces in the area. O'Neill retired to Ulster and Tyrell decided to submit to George Carew, Lord President of Ulster, after which he retired to Cavan. He was responsible for building the castle in Tyrrellspass.

The film is the first in a series of four western films starring Tony Anthony as \\"The Stranger\\". Released by MGM, it was a surprise box office hit in international markets. Plot A blanket-clad gunfighter, the Stranger, rides into a largely deserted Mexican village, where he encounters Chica, a young widow with a baby son, and Paco, a bartender who orders him at knife-point to leave. After killing Paco with a bottle, he witnesses a massacre of Captain Cordoba's Mexican Army troops by the bandit chief Aguilar and his gang, who steal the soldiers' uniforms and a machine gun. Dressed in a Union Army uniform, the Stranger greets Aguilar and his dominatrix right-hand woman, Maria \\"Maruka\\" Pilar, and informs them that an attachment of Union soldiers, led by Captain George Stafford, will soon be arriving to deliver two bags of gold coins to Captain Cordoba's troops. In return for identifying Aguilar as Cordoba to Stafford, the Stranger requests a share of the gold. The plan succeeds, despite Stafford's scepticism. Preparing to leave, the Stranger demands a half-share of the gold from Aguilar, who refuses, giving him only a single coin for his troubles. The Stranger creates a diversion by shooting the candles of the saloon, and steals the gold. Despite holding off Aguilar's men and escaping, he is forced to surrender the gold when they take Chica hostage. The Stranger later returns to recapture the gold, but he is ambushed and beaten by Aguilar's men, before being left to the attentions of Maruka, who becomes increasingly aroused by him. Eventually killing her by bashing her head against a stone floor, the Stranger distracts Aguilar and the gang by setting off an explosion, allowing him to steal the gold and save Chica, who has been abused by Aguilar. After tending to his wounds, Chica gives the Stranger a shotgun and a sack of shells; he gives her several gold coins - hiding the remainder in a fountain - and advises her to leave town with her baby. Before she can do so, Aguilar and his men track her down and threaten to kill her baby so that she can reveal the location of the gold. The Stranger saves them by shooting one of the bandits, Marinero; in a prolonged battle, he eliminates the gang members one by one as they search for him throughout the town. Confronting and beating Aguilar, the Stranger kills him in a shotgun- versus-machine gun duel, and places a gold coin between his teeth. Stafford's troops, aware of who the Stranger is, arrive to recover their gold; Stafford, whose real name is Ted Harrison, agrees to allow him to keep half of the gold as bounty for killing Aguilar's gang. Bidding \\"George\\" farewell, the Stranger is watched by Chica as he rides out of town.  Cast  * Tony Anthony as The Stranger * Frank Wolff (Frank Wolf) as Aguilar, the \\"Fair Man\\" * Jolanda Modio (as Yolanda Modio) as Chica * Gia Sandri as Maria \\"Maruka\\" Pilar * Raf Baldassarre as Corvo * Aldo Berti as Marinero * Lars Bloch as Captain Ted Harrison/\\"George Stafford\\" * Salvatore Puntillo as Priest * Fortunato Arena as Captain Cordoba * Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia (Ivan Scratt) as Aguilar Henchman Reception In his one-star review of the film, Roger Ebert parodied westerns of the film's type with his description of a critic who did not want to think of the film after he saw it but had a hard time forgetting about it. His then-rival at the Chicago Tribune, Clifford Terry, said the film was \\"not exactly a prime candidate for the Welcome Wagon\\" and adding that Anthony \\"looks like Audie Murphy might look if he were old enough to not shave [‚Ä¶] perspires more than Louis Armstrong on an August night, apparently believes that cheroot smoking is hazardous to his health, and has the distracting characteristic of walking more like a hairdresser than a gunslinger.\\" Paul Mavis, of DVDTalk, reviewing the 2015 Warner Archive Collection DVD release of The Stranger Collection, wrote, \\"While they're not in the league of Leone (what is?), Anthony's grimy, sneaky little punk killer is an intriguing addition to the genre. Tony Anthony did some very interesting things with the spaghetti Western genre, including, perhaps, presaging the Trinity movies, while certainly \\"inventing\\" the West-meets-East subgenre.\\" In his analysis of the Spaghetti Western genre, Alex Cox was highly critical of the Stranger films, which he felt were \\"brain-dead\\" and had \\"nothing at all to recommend them\\", and of Anthony, who he described as an \\"unappealing\\" actor who was \\"talented at nothing beyond sticking around for sequels\\". Writing specifically about A Stranger in Town, Cox described the film as \\"entirely routine and derivative\\" of Sergio Leone's films, and bemoaned the film's \\"tedious\\" pacing and \\"dull\\" violence. He felt that Frank Wolff, \\"a good actor of good guys\\", was miscast as Aguilar, finding Aldo Berti to be more convincingly villainous as Marinero. Cox also criticised the \\"inglorious\\" revelation of the Stranger as an army spy, the \\"endlessly repeated\\" score and the mostly \\"unimpressive\\" camerawork. However, he praised the contrasting use of light and dark in two scenes: a shootout lit only by gunshots, and Aguilar's gang revealing themselves to the Stranger by lighting matches.

It is notable for being situated in the city of Aberdeen itself yet containing an estate and gardens that are more commonly found in rural country houses. Friendville house is a category B listed building and the oldest residential property still in use in Aberdeen. It is one of Aberdeen's most valuable properties.\\"The stuff dreams are made of\\". Press and Journal. 11 October 2011. Retrieved 13 December 2012. History Friendville was built for Robert Balmanno in 1773 in the area of land known at the time as Balmanno's Field which was acquired a year early by Balmanno from the Rubislaw Estate and cultivated as farmland. Friendville was built at the edge of this land as a private residence for Balmanno where he stayed until 1798, when the house was purchased by Arthur Dingwall Fordyce.Brodgen, W. Aberdeen: An Illustrated Architectural Guide. Rutland Press; 4th Revised edition (May 1998). In the period between 1798 and 1952 Friendville changed hands a number of times but always remained a residential property, during this time large areas of the house were neglected and were allowed to deteriorate, particularly the grounds and the gardens of Friendville which became an eyesore in the affluent Mannofield neighborhood. In 1943 the estate was purchased by William Bell a well known antiques dealer in Aberdeen who undertook a project to restore Friendville. Under the guidance of architect Fenton Wynness, the house and grounds were renovated in an attempt to bring the house back to its original standard whilst maintaining the Georgian architecture and Victorian interior.Wyness, F. Aberdeen Century of Change. Impulse Books; 1st edition (Nov 1971). Architecture Friendville house was built in the late 18th century before the mass expansion of the oil industry when Aberdeen was still sparsely populated and land was vast and relatively easily obtainable, as such Friendville was built as a country manor and the city of Aberdeen grow around it, particularly in the early 20th century as the oil industry grew to prominence. The architectural style of Friendville reflects the freedom of the countryside, the house is built with eloquent Georgian masonry and the 2 acres of garden inside the grounds of Friendville are segregated as was common in the Victorian era. The interior also reflects Victorian design, containing wooden beams and a feature wooden staircase in the main hall. Present day Today, Friendville operates as a commercial venue available for private hire. It is operated by Oakhill Apartments.

Retrieved 2013-11-20. Mercedes- Benz's first eight-cylinder passenger car. Designated model W 08 was by the factory,Oswald, pp 231 & 262 it remained in production with various modifications and upgrades until the later summer of 1939, the longest lived Mercedes-Benz model of the 1920s and 1930s.  Typ N√ºrburg 460 1928‚Äì1929  The car was developed by Ferdinand Porsche, who had transferred to Daimler from the firm‚Äôs Austrian affiliate in 1923. Porsche was the board member with responsibility for new product development. The company‚Äôs objective with the new eight cylinder Mercedes-Benz was to come up with a serious competitor to the Horch 8,Oswald, pp 214: That Horch was the manufacturer's principal competitor in the German big car market was not without irony, since the Horch 8 was the car that Paul Daimler, son of the Daimler founder, had wanted to develop as a Daimler. Paul had been over-ruled and left the company in acrimonious circumstances to work for Horch, while new product development for the newly merged Daimler-Benz company was taken over by Ferdinand Porsche who transferred from Austro-Daimler. and Porsche‚Äôs work on the new car appears to have been very rushed.Oswald, p 231 The result was a car with a traditional ‚Äúoverslung‚Äù (‚ÄúHochbett‚Äù) chassis with the longitudinal chassis members directly above the axles, at a time when newer designs increasingly favored ‚Äúunderslung‚Äù (‚ÄúTiefbett‚Äù) chassis layouts on which the axles sat directly above the load bearing chassis beams. The 1928 Mercedes-Benz W08 therefore looked unfashionably tall even at the time of its launch. The engine was a 4,622cc straight-8 side-valve unit for which maximum output was given as at 3,400 rpm which translated into a top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). The wheels were suspended from rigid axles supported by semi-elliptical leaf springs at the front and at the back. Braking applied on all four wheels using a mechanical linkage supported by a Bosch-Dewandre vacuum suction device.Oswald, p 233 The car was close in size to the Horch 8 which had effectively been benchmarked for its design. The 1928 ‚ÄúPullman-Limousine‚Äù bodied version of the Horch came with an overall length of and a weight of 2,100 kg (bare chassis weight 1400 kg). The 1928 ‚ÄúPullman-Limousine‚Äù bodied version of the Mercedes- Benz N√ºrburg 460 was long which increased to when the detachable rear boot/trunk was added: the Mercedes weighed in at 2,150 kg (bare chassis weight 1550 kg).Oswald, pp 163 & 233 Both cars had an imposing height in this standard bodied form of even though the Horch had since its 1926 launch incorporated an ‚Äúunderlung‚Äù chassis. The cars‚Äô respective widths were and .Oswald, pp 163 & 233 In addition to the ‚ÄúPullman-Limousine‚Äù bodied car, priced by Mercedes-Benz at 15,000 Marks, buyers of the 1928 W08 could choose a Torpedo bodied 6 seater ‚ÄúTourenwagen‚Äù for 14,000 Marks or a 4-door ‚ÄúCabriolet D‚Äù for 17,500 Marks.Oswald, p 233 There is also mention of a reduced wheelbase 2-door cabriolet, although it is not clear whether any of these were produced based on the 1928 W 08. The big old fashioned and very expensive Mercedes-Benz W08 of 1928 found few customers, and had to be replaced the next year with a more stylish version, now using an ‚Äúunderslung‚Äù chassis. Technical Director Porsche‚Äôs contract was not renewed at the end of 1928 which was followed by two years of acrimonious litigation between the company and its former Technical Director, while there are reports that it took six years for Mercedes-Benz to sell off, at discounted prices, the already accumulated inventory of 1928 model N√ºrburg 460s.  Typ N√ºrburg 460 1929‚Äì1932  For 1929 the company‚Äôs first eight-cylinder model was extensively reworked by the newly appointed Technical Director Hans Nibel.Nibel had been Technical Director with Benz in 1926 when economic pressures had enforced the fusion of Benz with Daimler. Porsche had come from the Daimler side of the merger, and when his contract was not renewed in 1928, Nibel was his natural successor The result was a car with a modern ‚Äúunderslung‚Äù chassis whereby the longitudinal chassis beams were located below axel height. This made it easier for people to step into the car as well as allowing for a range of lower and more elegant car bodies to be fitted. The wheelbase was unchanged, however.Oswald, pp 231 & 233 The engine and most other technical details were carried over unchanged from the 1928 car including the ratios chosen for the four speed manual transmission. Synchromesh was not included at this stage. A newly available transmission option for 1929 was an additional ‚Äúoverdrive‚Äù ratio.Oswald, p 233 A shorter, if still substantial wheelbase version was available from 1931 for two door cabriolet body work, although as far as is known Mercedes-Benz themselves offered no ‚Äústandard Sindelfingen built\\" body of their own for this shorter chassis.Oswald, p 231 The standard bodies offered for the standard wheelbase 1929 cars covered the same possibilities as the 1928 body range.Oswald, p 233 It is clear from surviving examples that many customers preferred to buy the car in base chassis form and have a bespoke body added by an independent coachbuilder, however.Oswald, p 232 & 233 Despite the extensive makeover applied in 1929 the Mercedes-Benz W08 was still comfortably outsold by the Horch 8 which evidently was well entrenched at the top end of the German passenger car market at this time, and which in most body configurations was a little less overwhelmingly expensive than the eight cylinder contender from Mercedes-Benz. On the other hand, with this model Mercedes were able to ensure that the market place dominance of the big Horch was no longer completely unchallenged.Oswald, pp 163, 231 & 233 A Mercedes- Benz N√ºrburg 460 was gifted to the Pope in 1930.  Typ N√ºrburg 500 1931‚Äì1933  In 1931 the wheelbase car became available with an enlarged 4,918cc engine which now also featured a twin downdraft carburettor. Maximum output was now listed as at 3,100 rpm and claimed top speed increased to 110 km/h (69 mph). A wider range of standard bodies was also now listed including a six-seater ‚ÄúPullman-Cabriolet F‚Äù priced at 21,800 Marks, along with two and four door ‚ÄúCabriolet C‚Äù and ‚ÄúCabriolet D‚Äù models.Oswald, p 233  Typ 500 (1932‚Äì1936)  In 1932 the W08 lost the ‚ÄúN√ºrburg‚Äù name, being sold simply as the Mercedes- Benz Typ 500. The 4,918cc side-valve engine with its twin downdraft carburettor was unchanged, as were the four speed optional overdrive transmission, wheelbase, and list of standard body types.Oswald, pp 260, 262 & 263 Styling was changed slightly, the most obvious aspect of which was a slight raking of both radiator grill and windscreen.Oswald, p 260 Despite the same stated maximum output of engine compression ratio was slightly raised, as were transmission gear ratios and maximum torque. With slightly larger wheels the Typ 500 could reach 120 km/h (75 mph).Oswald, p 263  Typ 500 (1936‚Äì1939)  1936 saw an increase in claimed maximum output from the engine to at 3,300 rpm. The cylinder capacity at 4,918cc was unchanged, but there was a marginal raising of the compression ratio. The claimed top speed was now raised further to 123 km/h (76 mph).Oswald, p 263 Visually the 1936 cars can be differentiated from the increased rake of the front grill and windscreen. By this time the rival from Horch, the Horch 8, had disappeared from the scene (in 1935) and Mercedes-Benz production of their own 8 cylinder cars had slowed to a trickle. Between 1931 and 1935 the annual volume of passenger car sales in Germany more than tripled,Oswald, p 531 but these very large cars did not share in the general auto-market expansion of the 1930s. The W 08 remained in production till 1939, annual production volumes for 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939 falling to 87, 54, 50 and 51 cars.Oswald, pp 206 & 207 The model was discontinued in 1939 without any immediate successor, twenty-four years passing before the next 8-cylinder engined Mercedes-Benz appeared, the (Mercedes-Benz 600) in 1963. During its final years the W 08 was the only model in the manufacturer's range still featuring rigid axles and wooden wheels. The Mercedes-Benz W08 was never intended or expected to sell in massive volumes, and production totaled 3,824 cars during its eleven-year run between 1928 and 1939. Its less expensive and exclusive rival, the Zwickau built Horch 8, sold approximately 12,000 cars between 1926 and 1934.

Early life Haller was born in Altdorf, Switzerland, in 1923. He is half French on his mother's side and half German. His father was manager of a factory and loved food, and as a young boy Haller loved to cook. His mother planted a large kitchen garden, and as a child Haller would fetch fresh vegetables from the garden and watch as she cooked them. It was his father who encouraged him to be a chef. Haller recalls that when he was 14 years old, his father said, \\"Henry, why don't you be a chef? You can travel all over the world. And you will never have to worry about a job. People everywhere have to eat.\\" Haller, like all Swiss schoolchildren at the time who wished to enter a trade or profession, enrolled in an apprenticeship when he was 16 years old, and trained at the famed Park Hotel in the ski resort town of Davos, Switzerland. After graduating from high school at the age of 18, he served in the Swiss Army, and although World War II was raging he never saw combat. Discharged at the age of 20, he spent several years working at the exclusive Hotel Des Balances in Lucerne, where he attended the Hotel Training School‚Äîconsidered one of the best cooking academies in the world. He then moved to the five-star Hotel Belle-Vue-Palace in Bern, and then the Grand Hotel in B√ºrgenstock. While working there as chef tournant (filling in as needed on stations in the kitchen), the hotel owner asked if he would move to Canada to cook at another company-owned property, and Haller readily agreed. Move to America Haller had longed to follow other European chefs and live in the United States, but he first emigrated at the age of 25 to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1948, where he practiced his skills as the chef entremetier at the exclusive Ritz-Carlton Montreal, preparing appetizers, soups, vegetables, pastas, potatoes, and eggs. Haller emigrated to the United States in 1953, where he worked as the chef saucier at the Royal Palms Inn in Phoenix, Arizona. After a year, he took a position as the chef de cuisine (executive chef) at the Dellwood Country Club in Rockland County, New York (near New York City). He worked there for four years before becoming chef de cuisine at the Ambassador Hotel (later known as the Sheraton- East Hotel) in New York City. After three years, Haller moved to the Hotel Hampshire House in Manhattan. White House Haller (far right) working on the Nixon-Cox wedding cake in 1971. Lyndon B. Johnson had stayed at the Ambassador Hotel when he was Vice President of the United States, and enjoyed Haller's cooking. Johnson became President of the United States in November 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The White House Executive Chef at that time was Ren√© Verdon, who had been hired by the Kennedys. Verdon resigned at the end of 1965 in a dispute with President Lyndon B. Johnson over the cuisine being offered at the White House. Haller applied for the position, and was interviewed on January 1, 1966, in the White House by First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. Haller's appointment was announced on January 20, 1966. His first day on the job was February 1, at which time he made $10,000 a year. Haller was a probationary chef for the first six months of his tenure at the White House. During this time he lived on the third floor of the White House. Haller had oversight over three White House kitchens: The main kitchen on the ground floor, the family kitchen on the second floor, and a sous-kitchen on the mezzanine level of the sub-basement. (A stove existed in what used to be a former kitchen on the Third Floor as well, although it was rarely used.) He had a staff of seven or eight, two of which worked in the sous-kitchen. During his tenure at the White House, Haller oversaw the planning, preparation, and cooking for three First Family weddings: The marriage of Luci Baines Johnson to Patrick Nugent in August 1966, the marriage of Lynda Bird Johnson to Chuck Robb in December 1967, and the marriage of Tricia Nixon to Edward F. Cox in June 1971. He oversaw the design and preparation of wedding cakes for all three events. In 1976, Haller oversaw food preparation for White House events in honor of the United States Bicentennial. For much of 1976, the Ford administration had a normal schedule of one or two state dinners a month. But in June and July, Haller was preparing three or four state dinners each week. Because the federal government shifted the start of its fiscal year from May to October, Haller had little money to bring on additional staff to assist with the preparations and cooking. At the state dinner for Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Haller prepared a state dinner for 250, which was served on the South Lawn of the White House under a marquee. One of Haller's more difficult events was the dinner in September 1978 on the South Lawn to celebrate the signing of the Camp David accords. Haller was given just a week to plan, prepare, and cook a dinner for 1,300 people, an event which Rosalynn Carter's press secretary, Mary Holt, called \\"a nightmare\\". Retirement By 1987, Haller was making $58,000 a year. He announced his retirement on June 6, 1987, effective October 1, just in time for his 65th birthday. In retirement, Haller developed recipes for the liquor company Cointreau, and briefly advised the Grand Union supermarket chain regarding the development of fresh and frozen store-brand gourmet meals. Personal life While working at the Dellwood Country Club, Haller met Carole Itjen, a dining room worker at a hotel on Martha's Vineyard. The couple married, and had four children.

Albanese (born August 29, 1949) is a politician from New York City. He served as a New York City Council member, and ran unsuccessfully for several other public offices including New York State Assembly, United States Congress and Mayor of New York City. Personal and professional life Albanese was born in Mammola, Calabria, Italy. He came to New York City when he was eight years old and attended Our Lady of Peace Grammar School and John Jay High School. He received his Bachelor of Arts in Education from York College, City University of New York in 1972. After graduating from York, he taught in the New York Public School system at his alma mater, John Jay High School, for eleven years. Concurrently, he earned a Master of Arts in Health from New York University in 1976. Albanese was elected to the New York City Council in 1982. During his tenure, he earned a J.D. from Brooklyn Law School in 1990 and became a member of the New York State Bar. After leaving public office in 1998, he became Marketing Director for INVESCO and then Managing Director of Institutional Sales & Marketing for Mesirow Financial. He currently holds Series 7 and 63 Financial services licenses. Albanese resides in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn with wife of 40 years, Lorraine. The couple has two adult daughters, Danielle and Laura. Following a failed bid for Mayor in 2013, Albanese returned to practicing law as Of Counsel at Allegaert Berger & Vogel LLP. Political career In 1978, Albanese ran for New York State Assembly in the 50th District, losing 44.25% to 55.75% to Republican Florence Sullivan. Four years later, he ran for City Council and defeated Angelo J. Arculeo 51.44% to 48.57%. Arculeo was a 21-year incumbent and Republican-Conservative Minority Leader. Albanese won reelection four times and represented the 43rd District in the City Council until 1997, when he became a candidate for Mayor of New York City. He received 21% in the Democratic primary in 1997, coming in third place. In 1992, Albanese ran for United States Congress in the New York's 13th congressional district. He was defeated by Susan Molinari, who won 56.13% of the vote to Albanese's 38.24%. He returned to his work in the City Council thereafter. As a Council Member, Albanese was a member of the Council‚Äôs Public Safety, Education, and Transportation committees. He drafted laws requiring mandatory drug testing for school bus drivers and overhauled the previously- failing High School of Telecommunications. He supported increasing police presence in under-patrolled neighborhoods through community policing. He also initiated legislation requiring police to publish response times to emergency calls and led a successful effort to update the City's antiquated 9-1-1 system. Despite objections from Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Albanese passed the New York City Living Wage Bill in 1996, which \\"required some city contractors to pay higher minimum wages to their employees.\\" He was also the original sponsor of a Campaign Finance Reform Bill, stating that \\"If the present system stays in place, you will continue to have a city run for a few wealthy interests and by big business.\\" He famously voted against the proposed 1995 and 1996 budgets, arguing that they \\"balanced [the budget] on the backs of the middle class, poor, elderly and the youth of this city.\\" In the 1997 New York City mayoral election, Albanese ran for Mayor of New York City, placing third in the Democratic Party primary election. He earned 21.02% of the vote compared to Al Sharpton's 32.05% and winner Ruth Messinger's 40.19%. In 2000, he briefly entered the Mayoral race for a second time before bowing out early, citing the high cost of fundraising. In 2008, he was part of then-Senator Barack Obama's New York delegation to the Democratic National Convention. On December 14, 2012, Albanese opened a campaign for mayor in the 2013 New York City mayoral election. He placed eighth out of nine candidates in the Democratic Party primary, receiving 0.9% of the vote. Albanese again ran for mayor in the 2017 New York City mayoral election. He finished second in the Democratic primary with approximately 15% of the vote, but secured the Reform Party's nomination and appeared on the general election ballot where he placed third behind incumbent Bill de Blasio and a Republican challenger.

It existed during the \\"transitional\\" period before the Hollywood studio system centralized film production. The United States Motion Picture Corporation made one reel silent films in the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area from 1916 through 1919.  Business history  Incorporated in New Jersey on March 2, 1915, The United States Motion Picture Corporation established its main office in the Savoy Building in downtown Wilkes-Barre. Its studios were located across the Susquehanna River in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania, on Slocum Street near Wyoming Avenue. The company's studio, established in Forty Fort by the summer of 1915, was a glass and steel building that looked somewhat like a greenhouse, designed to allow maximum light for filming The United States Motion Picture Corporation was founded by James O. Walsh, who was its president, Fred W. Hermann, who was the vice president, and Daniel L. Hart, who was its treasurer and is also listed as its scenario editor in one newspaper account. Hart, an award-winning playwright, would later serve as the mayor of Wilkes-Barre from 1920 to his death in 1933. Black Diamond Comedies Between October 2, 1916 and November 12, 1917, the United States Motion Picture Corporation produced and released twenty-seven Black Diamond Comedies. \\"Black Diamond\\" referred to anthracite coal, deposits of which had made Wilkes-Barre and the surrounding area a center of the mining industry and contributed to the region's wealth. The one-reel silent films were the first comedies distributed by Paramount Pictures, which was then based in New York. Paramount advertised these comedies widely in 1917, sometimes alongside those of Fatty Arbuckle, another Paramount comic artist. The films often followed a comic character named Susie, portrayed by USMPC‚Äôs leading lady Leatrice Joy, through mishaps and blunders. The films' advertisements that appear in The Moving Picture World magazine note the use of comic special effects with stop action and film speed experimentation. After the company ended its contract with Paramount Pictures in 1917, USMPC released six additional one-reel comic films as Unique Comedies, which were distributed by the Arrow Film Company of New York. These include \\"His Neglected Wife,\\" which also stars Leatrice Joy and other actors who appeared in Black Diamond Comedies. The United States Motion Picture Corporation also released Rainbow Comedies, one-reel comic films distributed by the General Film Company, in 1918 and 1919. These films often starred Lillian Vera and Eddie Boulden and were directed by Joseph A. Richmond. Company end The United States Motion Picture Corporation stopped producing films in 1919. The company's studios in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania were subsequently used by the Serico Company, which filmed its serial A Woman in Grey in 1920.

It is more commonly referred to as Hansa Haus.  History  Since the late 18th century, German settlers have been among the most dominant cultural groups settling and developing Ontario's southern regions. A portion of Germans emigrating their home country post World War II settled in southern Ontario's Brampton and the surrounding areas. At that time Brampton and Peel County had many nurseries and farms where they found employment, or started their own businesses in trades they had learned in Germany before immigrating. Early Years A restaurant on third line and Queen St. West in Brampton, Ontario became a meeting place for many of those immigrants. Over time an idea emerged to establish a German Cultural Centre in the region. Because of the unfamiliarity with Canadian laws among most of these largely new immigrants, a more seasoned member of these social gatherings, Mr. Gerhard Neud√∂rffer, was asked if he was willing to approach authorities. The law at the time stated that only a Canadian citizen could be President of such an organization. Since he was the only one who could give satisfaction to all the requirements of the law, he was asked to spear-head this endeavour. During the winter of 1957/58 the efforts to establish a cultural centre were intensified and in March 1958, the German Canadian Club Hansa was officially registered. Until the purchase of the clubhouse in 1962, the meetings of the newly founded organization were held at the home of the Neud√∂rffer's family. It was also used as storage for everything concerning the club. In addition, a sizable parcel of land was bought adjacent to the newly acquired club house on Highway 10. Once all was settled the activities of the club moved to its new home. From 1966 to 1973, due to limited space at the club's facility, dances were held in various nearby Halls in Brampton. One of the club's first - and therefore oldest - under groups was the Ladies Auxiliary who made sure that the stomach came to its right during social events. Much of the credit that the Hansa Club became an institution in and around Brampton is due to this group. The Ladies Auxiliary organized traditional German Christmas parties and Easter egg hunts which remain a cultural highlights for the members and their children. During the early years the Hansa Haus Club became very active not only in social but also in community affairs. For instance, Peel Memorial Hospital was one of the beneficiaries, because the proceeds of one social dance per year were donated to the hospital. The club also sponsored a Pee Wee Baseball and Minor Hockey team and support was given to the Senators Drum and Bugle Corps. The Hansa Club took active part in the annual Flower Festival and the highlight was when the Hansa Club received first prize with a replica of the Hansa Haus at the parade. Furthermore, the Hansa Club was the first to organize a \\"Biergarten\\" during the Flower Festival, which became a favourite place to soak parched tongues and rest tired feet after the parade. With the acquisition of the property on Highway 10, the club developed tremendously spawning a wealth of under groups who all offered social, sporting and cultural events not only to its members, but also the community within its region. There were soccer teams, a choir, and folk dance groups, to name only a few. To highlight the Hansa Haus's integration into its multicultural Canadian society the club's members organized Mardi Gras dances from the early 1960s. In spring 1966 the Hansa Mardi Gras Society was formed and took over the responsibility to contributing to the naturally colourful Mardi Gras Season. Growth Profiting from the economic success of its members the German Canadian Club Hansa underwent a phase of heavy investment in its facilities. culminating in the opening of a new club house named \\"Hansa Haus\\" in November 1973. It was also the beginning of a changed structure of the club. Gradually the social club became a combination of club, business and cultural centre. The main purpose of the club, however, remained to keep German tradition and culture alive and share it with its diverse Canadian friends of non-German origin German traditions and culture. Having this in mind, the Hansa Club and the \\"Historical Society of Mecklenburg Upper Canada\\" agreed to convert the second floor of the now old clubhouse into a German Heritage Museum. It opened in the fall of 1983.  Present  The board rekindled the long-standing Hansa Haus Christmas Market tradition and intends to expand its annual \\"Hansa goes Classic\\" event of classical music, opera, operetta and musical theatre. The current board remains committed to keeping Hansa Haus events open to the general public in an effort to showcase the German contribution to the rich cultural fabric of Ontario. The membership has swelled to more than 500+ members, and countless other individuals, groups and major corporations of all facets, now enjoy the facilities that have been built by the members of the German Canadian Club Hansa to celebrate their own milestones of 60 years. It was featured in Masterchef Canada's season 3 with the contestants serving gourmet sausages at an Oktoberfest festival hosted by Hansa Haus.

Unlike a modern judge, the asega gave in most cases only an expert opinion on the law itself rather than on the facts of the case.Karl Otto Johannes Theresius Freiherr von Richthofen, Untersuchungen √ºber friesische Rechtsgeschichte Part 2, volume 1 Upstalsbom, Freiheit und Grafen in Friesland, Berlin: Hertz, 1882, , p. 458 As can be seen from the legal system known as Oudere Schoutenrecht, in the Old Frisian legal system with its formal approach to evidence, there was little room for appreciation of the facts of the case. Nevertheless, in exceptional circumstances, when there was a need for interpreting old sources of law in arriving at an appreciation of the case, the asega was asked for his opinion. The court could however refuse to accept his interpretation, simply arriving at its own verdict. During the Middle Ages, the asega's role became superfluous and his function was discontinued, in most areas towards the end of the 13th century.A. L. P.

In Amstelland asegas were used as part of the legal system until 1388. According to a Frisian legend recorded in the 14th century, twelve asegas were originally given the Lex Frisionum, the written law of Friesland, by the god Fosite after Charlemagne had demanded they recite their law and they were unable to do so, having only custom.von Richthofen, pp. 459-64.Hilda R.

Following the final draft of the 2012 electoral review, 64 councillors were elected from 61 electoral divisions which returned either one or two county councillors each by first-past-the- post voting for a four-year term of office. No elections were held in the City of Derby, which is a unitary authority outside the area covered by the County Council. The Labour Party won back control of the council by a landslide victory, taking forty-two of the authority's sixty-four seats. All locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election. Background The previous election ended 28 years of Labour control, giving the Conservatives an overall majority of two seats and control of the council. However, their majority was eroded by the suspension and defection of two Conservative councillors, leaving the council hung.http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/elections/default.asp/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Councillor- Robin-Baldry-enter-plea-expenses- case/story-16193114-detail/story.html#axzz2SA4iRkE3http://www.newsrt.co.uk/news/heage- tory-councillor-defects-to-ukip-1491567.html Election results Derbyshire County Council ‚Äì Results by District Amber Valley Borough (10 seats, 9 electoral divisions) = Alfreton and Somercotes = =Alport and Derwent= =Belper= = Duffield and Belper South = =Greater Heanor= =Heanor Central= =Horsley= =Ripley East and Codnor= =Ripley West and Heage= Bolsover District (6 seats, 6 electoral divisions) =Barlborough and Clowne= =Bolsover North= =Bolsover South= =Shirebrook and Pleasley= =South Normanton and Pinxton= =Tibshelf= Chesterfield Borough (9 seats, 9 electoral divisions) =Birdholme= =Boythorpe and Brampton South= =Brimington= =Loundsley Green and Newbold= =Spire= =St Mary's= =Staveley= =Staveley North and Whittington= =Walton and West= Derbyshire Dales District (6 seats, 6 electoral divisions) =Ashbourne= =Bakewell= =Derwent Valley= =Dovedale= =Matlock= =Wirksworth= Erewash Borough (9 seats, 9 electoral divisions) =Breadsall and West Hallam= =Breaston= = Ilkeston East = = Ilkeston South = =Ilkeston West= =Long Eaton= =Petersham= =Sandiacre= =Sawley= High Peak Borough (8 seats, 7 electoral divisions) =Buxton North and East= =Buxton West= =Chapel and Hope Valley= =Etherow= =Glossop and Charlesworth= =New Mills= =Whaley Bridge= North East Derbyshire District (8 seats, 7 electoral divisions) =Clay Cross North= =Clay Cross South= =Dronfield East= =Dronfield West and Walton= =Eckington and Killamarsh= =Sutton= =Wingerworth and Shirland= South Derbyshire District (8 seats, 8 electoral divisions) =Aston= =Etwall and Repton= =Hilton= =Linton= =Melbourne= =Swadlincote Central= =Swadlincote North= =Swadlincote South= By-Elections between May 2013 ‚Äì May 2017 By-elections are called when a representative Councillor resigns or dies, so are unpredictable.

(The Department of Biological Sciences was formed from the merger of the Department of Botany and the Department of Zoology at the start of the 2013 academic year). The Animal Demography Unit, popularly known as the ADU, was responsible for the management of the First and Second Southern African Bird Atlas Projects SABAP1 and SABAP2. The unit has submitted over eight million georeferenced biodiversity records to GBIF. History The Animal Demography Unit (formerly the Avian Demography Unit), or ADU as it is mostly known in the vernacular, is a research unit of the University of Cape Town. Initially it was built on the nucleus of the South African Bird Ringing Unit (SAFRING) and the Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP). The ADU was established in December 1991 within the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Cape Town. Over the years, the ADU has grown far beyond its starting point. The concept on which the ADU is based can be traced back to 1983, when a workshop was held in Johannesburg on the establishment of a Bird Populations Data Bank for South Africa. This workshop was held in conjunction with a \\"Birds and Man\\" symposium which had been organised by the Southern African Ornithological Society (now BirdLife South Africa). The ADU has continued to be closely associated with BirdLife South Africa. and has a formal partnership relationship with that organization, with the objective of fostering the development of further ornithological projects. This close association is appropriate because much of the research of the ADU continues to focus on large scale demographic studies in which participation by amateurs is a vital element. Over the past years, the ADU has expanded the range of projects for which it is responsible. This website provides information on them, and the people who undertake them.

Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 pp194-5 Despite his vigorous efforts, he failed to gain further promotion, but his second son John, Lord Annaly, became Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Life He was the second son of Sir Arthur Gore, 1st Baronet of Newtown, County Mayo and his wife Eleanor, daughter of Sir George St George, knight, of Carrickdrumrusk, County Leitrim, and Katherine Gifford. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and the University of Dublin, where he matriculated in 1691 and received a degree of Doctor of Laws in 1709. He entered Middle Temple in 1698 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1700.Ball p.194 He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Longford Borough and was made Attorney General in 1714. He accepted a place on the Court of Common Pleas in 1720, apparently due to an asthmatic complaint, which made his previous office too onerous. Almost at once he began to lobby for the Chief Justiceship of whichever court first became available. He had the support of William King, the influential Archbishop of Dublin who, on the return to England of Sir Jeffrey Gilbert, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1722, wrote to the Government pointing out that death, retirement, illness and overwork had reduced the Irish judiciary to \\"a pitiful condition\\" and arguing that Gore would fill the office of Chief Baron well.Ball p. 94 In the event he was passed over in favour of Sir Bernard Hale, nor despite his best efforts was he ever promoted to the rank of Chief Justice. Elrington Ball believed that the reason for his failure to achieve promotion was his lack of legal ability: he was much loved by his friends, but none of them praised his judicial qualities.Ball p. 93 In the 1740s his health, which had never been good, failed and he retired in 1745. The retirement itself was a matter of controversy since Gore insisted on being replaced by his nephew Robert French, the son of his sister Anne Gore French; the Government was most unwilling to make this appointment, since French was a poor lawyer and extremely unpopular, but it reluctantly agreed. Gore married Bridget Sankey, daughter and co- heiresss of John Sankey of Tenelick, County Longford and his wife Eleanor Morgan of County Sligo, and acquired great wealth through his marriage. They had eight children, including the following three sons and one daughter:Translation by Rev. James Lyster, Rector of Tashinny 1848‚Äì1854, with corrections by J. R.

Although still commercially available, the Windows version has not been developed recently so has largely historical significance only. It is known for its high level of strength and as a trainer engine to help beginners improve their chess techniques. Playing strength The playing strength of Chess Tiger is inferior to better known programs such as Fritz and Shredder. In 2001 Chess Tiger won a tournament in Buenos Aires ahead of a number of top grandmasters, and achieved a rating performance of 2788 Elo rating. Chess Tiger won the French and Dutch Chess Computer Championships three times each. Chess Tiger won the first Berliner Emanuel-Lasker Computerchess-Tournament in October 2001. Playing style Chess Tiger is designed to be particularly aggressive in its style of play. While most chess engines tend to avoid gambits and sacrifices Chess Tiger actually prefers them. Chess Tiger calculates very quickly even in relatively weak hardware environments which implies that the evaluation function is fairly 'light' and that therefore the balance between speed and positional understanding is weighted in favour of the former.

Early years John Filmore was born around 1788. He joined the navy as a boy, enlisting as a midshipman on HMS Sirius under Captain William Prowse, in which he fought in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. During that battle he was sent on board one of the disabled ships that had been captured, taking charge of the vessel. He was made a Lieutenant on 16 January 1808. He soon became First Lieutenant of the Crocodile under Captain E.H. Columbine, assigned to the African station. In an expedition of 1809 against Senegal he served under Columbine on the Solebay frigate. When Columbine died in 1811 he assumed command of the Crocodile. Filmore was appointed Commander with seniority as of 18 June 1811. In the summer of 1822 he was appointed to the Ordinary at Plymouth. African station Filmore was sent again to the African station to command the Bann, a sloop of war. He was appointed to this command on 30 May 1823. Sir Robert Mends, Commodore of the African Station, died at Cape Coast on 4 September 1823, and Lieutenant Pringle Stokes took charge of the ship. Filmore arrived as a passenger on the Swinger gun-brig in October 1823. On hearing of the death of the commodore Filmore appointed himself to command the station and transferred to the frigate Owen Glendower. Stokes returned to England. On 4 December 1823 Captain Percy Grace, who had been the senior commander on the African Station, returned from a long cruise in the Cape Verde Islands and received an order from the Admiralty, sent to him by Filmore, ordering him to return to England. Grace decided not to dispute the order, and after a stormy passage reached England on 7 February 1824. In 1824 Filmore was made acting Captain of the Owen Glendower pending the appointment of his replacement, Captain Hood Hanway Christian, in September. After twelve months, debilitated by fever, he resigned and returned to England. Later years The Admiralty did not confirm Filmore and promote him to Captain until August 1824, after his return to England. He never fully recovered from the illness. Filmore wife, Kate, died in London in 1837. Filmore died on 24 May 1839 at the age of 50.

The film is about Lawrence White who returns to his hometown of Owell Rock with his sister to avenge the father's death at the hands of a gang. The leader of the gang, Doc Lester ahs recently appointed himself the gunslinger Boyd as the new sheriff. La morte non conta i dollari was Freda's only Western he directed. Co-written with Giuseppe Masini, it was shot in Rome with actors Mark Damon and Luciano Pigozzi. Second unit director Yves Boisset suggested that Freda had shot the film without caring for the production and that a stuntman had even died on set. Actor Stephen Forsyth had denied any death occurring while filming. Plot Lawrence White returns to his hometown and reopens the investigation about the murder of his father. At the same time arrives Boyd, who frequently gets into fights. Doc Lester, who is the one behind the murder, hires Boyd and makes him the sheriff to stop White. However, it turns out that \\"Boyd\\" is the real Lawrence White, while ‚ÄùWhite‚Äù is a friend of his. Rustlers kill Major White, and a witness who reports to the sheriff is later shot and has his tongue cut out. Many years later the son of major White returns in a stagecoach. It is stopped by some military, but another passenger, Boyd, discloses them as false, and they ride off. When White arrives people say that this will mean trouble for major Lester. White now tries to reopen the murder case of his father and gets into a fight with Lester's men. White's sister, on the other hand, advocates vengeance. Boyd gets into several fights and is recruited by Lester, who has him appointed the new sheriff when the old one is killed. Elisabeth, a girl he has acquainted, now rejects him and asks him to find the murderer of her father, who has been killed by men of Lester, because he intended to help White. When he visits the widow of the former land officer, White is caught in a trap by Lester's men. She explains that they would have tortured her otherwise. Lester sends Boyd to make White confess to murder, but instead he unties White. Some Lester men now appear saying that Lester did right to check him. They start beating Boyd when the widow appears with a rifle. She is shot but Boyd gets a gun and kills them. We now learn that Boyd is the real son of major White, while \\"White\\" is his friend, a federal lawyer from Washington. White follows a lead and finds judge Warren's daughter as a prostitute in Mexico. He now can convince the judge top reopen the case. Lester's gang ambush White, but the stage is manned with dolls and explodes, and the rest of the gang is killed in the ensuing gunfight. Lester is arrested. White stays on as sheriff united with Elisabeth, while his friend leaves with White's sister.

Production After returning to the Italian film industry, Freda collaborated with scriptwriter Giuseppe Masini. Freda stated that for the script, he took inspiration from Prosper M√©rim√©e's Carmen. Second unit director Yves Boisset stated that he tried to get Klaus Kinski for the leading role in the film, but the producer did not take his suggestion. Mark Damon got the lead role in the film, having previously starred in other Italian Western's including Johnny Oro (1966) and Johnny Yuma (1966). The film was predominantly shot in the hills around Rome. Actor Stephen Forsyth stated that Freda took care of the whole shooting noting that \\"in general it would be unusual for any scenes with dialogue and principal actors to be done without the director present.\\" Boisset described Freda's attitude towards the film while directing as indifferent, stating that \\"during shooting everybody ceased to care. Freda was not the only one responsible for that; there was also the climate of vulgarity on the part of the producers, but he accommodated. I think Riccardo got enguled in a ghetto by himself, working with third-rate producers and actors.\\" In his autobiography, Boisset recalls directions of scenes such as the filming of a saloon brawl which are not in the film and claims that the film was shot at the same time as another production with the same cast and crew. Forsyth stated that \\"two films being shot together is news to me\\" Boisset also recalled a fatality on set involving a stuntman, which Forsyth also denied happening. Italian film historian Roberto Curti stated that no other sources outside Boisset reported the death. Release La morte non conta i dollari credits have Freda using the alias George Lincoln. Freda has stated that his edit of the film was \\"destroyed\\" by censors and that \\"I had little resources, and they cut the most violent scenes....But I insist, I wrote the scenario, it was a cruel film.\\" Despite Freda's accusations, the board of censors only cut six seconds from the film on its release. The film was distributed theatrically in Italy by Warner Bros. on July 21, 1967. The film grossed 151 million Italian lire domestically in Italy. Curti described the film's reception as \\"almost unnoticed\\" in Italy. Freda also disliked the title of the film, feeling that it \\"doesn't mean anything., neither in French, nor in English, and not even in Italian!\\" On the film's release in Denmark, it was released as Johnny Yma vender tilbage, a sequel to Romolo Guerrieri's Johnny Yuma which also starred Damon. The film has been released in the United States under various titles, including Death at Owell Rock, No Killing Without Dollars and Death Does Not Count the Dollars.

In 1958, he was Vice-President of the General Board of Members of ICEA (Institute of Economic Sciences and Autonomous-Management), and Vice-President I of the ANHC (National Association of Cuban Sugar Mill Owners), where he presided on 2 occasions during the 1940s, and in 1951-1956. Consulting Counselor, 1952-1955. de Pando was declared by the Castro government as the most influential leader in the Cuban sugar industry.  History  In 1917, the maternal side of his family, the Armand-Roches, became co-owners of the Romeli√© sugar estate, along with the Brooks family heirs. The Brooks family was English, and owners of several sugar estates in the Guant√°namo region, along with the McKinleys. They were partners from 1905 until the mid-1920s when the de Pando family became the sole owners of Romelie. In the 1940s, de Pando entered into an agreement with Julio Lobo Olavarr√≠a and with Dr. Delio Nu√±ez Mesa, for the purchase of more sugar interests. Later, in March 1944, de Pando and Julio Lobo participated in the purchase of the ‚ÄúTinguaro‚Äù sugar estate for $1,650,000,(approx $14.6 M in today's dollars) along with Rafael √Åguila Sarduy and others. De Pando was an advisor and minority shareholder of the \\"Banco Atl√°ntico\\" from its founding in 1951 until its sale in April 1954 to ‚ÄúThe Trust Company of Cuba.‚Äù In 1953, de Pando was a member of the board of directors of ‚ÄúThe Cuba Company.‚Äù  Philanthropy  In 1956, he established with a generous donation, the General Pando Legacy. This foundation in honor of his father, General Luis Manuel de Pando, was intended to honor Spanish military survivors and the museum of engineers. It was to be managed by the association of engineers.  Personal life  De Pando married Emma Ramsden y de la Torre, daughter of Frederick Wollaston Ramsden, former British Consul General and Susana de la Torre. Their only son, Luis Manuel de Pando y Ramsden later married Mar√≠a Victoria Quiroga and had four children. Luis Manuel was a Vice-President of the sugar estates. On September 21, 1961, de Pando and his family were forced into exile when the Castro government announced the expropriation of all the family property and holdings. They settled in Key Biscayne, Florida. De Pando divided his time between there and Madrid until his death in Madrid in 1977.

He was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and initially played classical percussion in the Adelaide Conservatorium of Music, before teaching himself the guitar. In 1967 Peek formed a Psychedelic pop, progressive rock group, James Taylor Move but left by May 1968, moving to London. He returned to Adelaide, Australia, to join a newly formed rock band Quartet which, despite a contract from England's Decca Records, proved artistically unsuccessful. An Australian single \\"Now\\"/\\"Will My Lady Come\\" [Decca Y-8977] was released in 1969. The A-side is credited to Terry Britten; the B-side to Trevor Spencer, Alan Tarney and Peek. For a time, following their move to London, he and his fellow Adelaide-born bandmates‚Äîguitarist Terry Britten, bassist Alan Tarney, and drummer Trevor Spencer‚Äîmade their livings as session musicians together, playing with everyone from the New Seekers and Mary Hopkin (Earth Song, Ocean Song) to Cliff Richard, whose regular backing band they became on stage and on record during the 1970s. Peek also worked with Manfred Mann, Lulu, Tom Jones, Jeff Wayne (War of the Worlds), and Shirley Bassey, among others. He wrote the music for the internationally broadcast \\"Singapore Girl\\" television advertisements for Singapore Airlines. In 1979, he joined the classical/progressive rock quintet Sky. In association with classical guitarist John Williams, keyboardist Francis Monkman, bassist Herbie Flowers, and drummer Tristan Fry, Peek played on seven studio albums with the band, before departing in 1985. Peek recorded three albums‚ÄîGuitar Junction, Awakening, and Life & Other Games‚Äî but achieved greater prominence through his work with Sky and his session work with Olivia Newton-John, Kiki Dee, Sally Oldfield, the Alan Parsons Project, and the London Symphony Orchestra (in association with Francis Monkman on their Symphonic Rock: British Invasion releases). He also played on various soundtracks, including Monkman's music for The Long Good Friday. Peek was jailed for three years in 1994 for 28 counts of fraud over a scheme in which he admitted faking information provided to factoring financier Scottish Pacific. Following a failed business venture and bankruptcy, in 2010 he was again prosecuted in Perth, Western Australia on two counts of making a false statement to deceive or defraud. A full trial was originally scheduled for 2011, later adjourned until 2012\\"Former rock guitarist Kevin Peek to fight $8 million fraud charges\\" - article by Phil Hickey in Perth Now, 2 November 2011. and ultimately never took place. Peek died of melanoma in a Perth hospice on 11 February 2013, aged 66 years.

Cabell on his Fayetteville raid in April 1863.Arkansas Historical Quarterly, Vol. LIV, No. 3 (Autumn 1995) Confederate Brigadier General Cabell departed Ozark, Arkansas, with 900 cavalry and Hughey's Battery with the intent of dislodging the Union from Fayetteville, Arkansas. Approaching the city from the south, the Confederates captured nine Union soldiers near West Fork, Arkansas, at night on April 17. The following morning the Confederates climbed East Mountain and Hughey's Battery fired south into the city. Cabell's cavalry rushed the city streets around 6:00 am intending to attack the Tebbetts House which held the Union command. The attackers halted and waited for cannon fire from the Hughey's Battery stationed on the mountain to damage the headquarters. Confederates pressed their attack into Fayetteville, capturing Union soldiers and destroying a supply train before the Union rallied and repelled the Southern troops. Union soldiers began approaching the Hughey's Battery upon East Mountain under cover. By this time the battery was under attack and out of ammunition forcing its withdrawal. General Cabell described the battery's effect: During the Action a Fayetteville, the battery suffered two horses killed, two horses wounded, one man killed and several wounded. William Hughey was himself wounded in the arm in the battle of Fayetteville.

Kirby Smith, commanding the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, issued Special Orders No. 290, organizing the artillery of the department into battalions. The component batteries rarely, if ever, operated together. They were usually assigned individually to an infantry or cavalry brigade to provide fire support. In this reorganization, Hughey's Battery, armed with 4 guns, and commanded by Capt. John G. Marshall was re-designated as the 8th Arkansas Field Battery and assigned to the 2nd Artillery Battalion, commanded by Major J. H. Pratt. Surrender The battery surrendered with General Kirby Smith on May 26, 1865. The date of the military convention between Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith and Union General Edward Canby for the surrender of the troops and public property in the Trans-Mississippi Department was May 26, 1865, however, it took a while for parole commissioners to be appointed and for public property to be accounted for.

His research interests include biocomplexity and sustainability in prehistoric human ecology (particularly with respect to Arctic cultures), warfare and inequality in prehistory, the application of Darwinian theory and evolutionary psychology to archaeology, GIS in archaeology, isotope analysis and virtual museums and repositories. Maschner was a professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1993‚Äì1999), Idaho State University (1999‚Äì2015) and the University of South Florida (2015‚Äì2017). He resigned his professorship following controversy over his sexual harassment of a student at ISU and complaints about his conduct at USF. Career Maschner studied at the University of Wyoming and at the University of New Mexico under Lewis Binford, graduating in 1980 with a BS in Anthropology. He received a master's degree in archaeology from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks in 1987 with a thesis entitled Site Structure, Site Use, and Site Reuse of an Ahtna (Na Dene) Spring Camp and a PhD in Anthropology from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1992 with a dissertation entitled The Origins of Hunter-Gatherer Sedentism and Political Complexity: A Case Study from the Northern Northwest Coast. His PhD dissertation advisors included Brian Fagan and Napoleon Chagnon. After a brief stint at UC Santa Barbara, Maschner was appointed Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, a post he held from 1993 to 1999. He then moved to Idaho State University, where he was Research Professor in the Department of Anthropology. He created and directed the Center for Archaeology, Materials, and Applied Spectroscopy. Maschner was also affiliated with the Idaho Accelerator Center and was the Director of the Idaho Museum of Natural History between 2010 and 2015. In 2015 he moved to the University of South Florida as the director of the Center for Virtualization and Applied Spatial Technologies (CVAST), and a professor in the Department of Anthropology and School of Geosciences. In 2016, following the revelation that he had been reprimanded for sexual harassment in his former position at ISU, Maschner was demoted from his post as director of CVAST. He resigned from USF entirely in 2017, following further complaints about his conduct and a formal review.http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/college/usf-scientist-resigns- ending-a-short-tenure-filled-with-turmoil/2335142 Maschner was the keynote speaker for the Arctic Section of the 2003 conference of the American Association for the Advancement of the Sciences.

He serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of World Prehistory and the Alaska Journal of Anthropology. Research Maschner's research interests include complex systems analyses of the North Pacific Rim and Western North America, particularly the eastern Aleutian region, Northwest Coast, western sub-Arctic, and Idaho. Maschner's archaeological exploration of this geographic region is multidisciplinary and synthesizes both human and environmental factors to present a holistic understanding of the areas in question.

He was her supervisor at the time. According to Pokorny, he engaged in inappropriate conduct and showered her with unwanted attention for several months, culminating with him assaulting her in her office on October 25, 2013. Maschner allegedly entered her office, closed the door, grabbed her by the buttocks, and kissed her on the lips. Pokorny filed a sexual harassment complaint with Idaho State University's Human Resources Office three days after the assault. Both the ISU Human Resources Office and Opportunity Office conducted investigations and determined that she was telling the truth. ISU issued a final report on January 9, 2014, concluding that her claim and statement of facts were credible, that Maschner's counterclaim and statement of facts were meritless, and that Maschner violated ISU's sexual harassment policy. Maschner was issued a formal reprimand and was suspended for two weeks without pay. He was also ordered to attend sexual harassment training, but he left Idaho State to begin work at South Florida before completing the required training. ISU's final report recommended that she be allowed to return to work as education coordinator at the museum with a different supervisor. Maschner requested on January 29, 2014, that the investigation of the original sexual harassment claim be reopened by the university. After further investigation, the equal opportunity office at ISU again reaffirmed the veracity of the sexual harassment claims against him.  Lawsuit  On 18 February 2015 Pokorny filed a lawsuit seeking monetary damages against Idaho State University for violations of the Idaho Human Rights Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Sixth District Judge Robert Naftz earlier rejected ISU's request to kill the case, writing that the original investigation by the school found the woman's claims credible and Maschner's claims meritless.  Employment at USF  Maschner took a position at the University of South Florida in August 2015. He did not inform his employer about his sexual harassment finding until more than a year later, when it became apparent that an Idaho newspaper was publishing an article about it. According to USF Maschner was not hired like other applicants and the university was not aware of the sexual harassment. In response, USF stripped him of his position as director of CVAST, although he remained employed as its tenured \\"chief scientist\\".http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/college/report-usf-faculty- complained-of-a-hostile-sexist-boorish-boss/2328288 The following year, USF initiated a legal review of Maschner's conduct following complaints that he was a \\"hostile, sexist, boorish boss\\". The review concluded that Maschner was \\"hostile with many subordinates\\", but did not find evidence that his behaviour was discriminatory. Maschner resigned from USF shortly after the report was published. Selected publications Monographs *Archaeology of the Sapsuk River, Alaska.

It was created to haul finished lumber from timber lands to market. It was acquired by the Michigan Central Railroad. History David Ward (died May 29, 1900), a land holder owning 70,000 acres of timber lands in the Northern Michigan counties of Otsego, Crawford, Antrim, Charlevoix, and Kalkaska, needed a way to economically access his timber holdings and ship the harvested timber to sawmills located in Bay City, Michigan. In 1893, Ward began construction of the Frederic & Charlevoix RR Co., a logging railroad interconnected at Frederic, Michigan with the Michigan Central Railroad Mackinac Division and extended 42.66 miles to East Jordan, Michigan, formerly known as South Arm on the shores of Lake Charlevoix, formerly known as Pine Lake. In 1897, the last three miles into East Jordan were removed for an unknown reason. Death of David Ward On May 29, 1900, David Ward died, leaving his timberlands to his six children with the provision that for 12 years after his death, his son Willis C. Ward, his grandson Franklin B. Ward and his son-law George K. Root should have full authority to manage, harvest and control said timberland, with profits being divided equally among his surviving six children. After 12 years, the entire estate would be divided equally between the surviving six children.WARD'S ESTATE. Appeal of WARD et al. (Supreme Court of Michigan. April 1, 1908), published by the Michigan Secretary of State This created a huge incentive for the Ward executors to conduct a massive clearcutting of the timberlands to monetize the timber holdings, since dividing the 70,000 acres equitably between the six children would be difficult. Establishment of Detroit & Charlevoix Railroad The estate executors determined that shipping 70,000 acres of harvested timber to Bay City was not efficient. The most efficient method would be to build a modern sawmill close to the timber and upgrade the logging railroad to accommodate Class I railroad rolling stock so the finished lumber could be shipped to the large markets like Chicago.THE AUBURN BULLETIN, FRIDAY. JANUARY 25, 1901, published by Auburn Publishing Co Cayuga County, New York On January 1, 1901, the estate executors, Willis C. Ward, Franklin B. Ward and George K. Root, organized a corporation, under the general railroad laws of the State of Michigan, named the Detroit & Charlevoix Railroad Company, with an authorized capital stock of $525,000 to which all equipment and right-a-way property of David Ward‚Äôs Frederic & Charlevoix RR Co. were transferred. At this time, the road had three steam locomotives equipped with air brakes, 25 Russel Logging Cars and 29 platform cars rated to 60,000 lbs with air brakes, two snow plows and two passenger cars. The executors planned to improve the line to accommodate interstate railcars, rebuild the line into East Jordan, Michigan, and extend the line to Charlevoix, Michigan, 13 miles to the northwest. In winter 1901, the executors began the construction of a 600-horsepower, steam-driven, double-band sawmill plant at the site called Deward near the headwaters of the Manistee River 11 miles from Frederic, on the line of the logging railroad, and about 30 miles from East Jordan. This sawmill had an annual capacity of 20 million board feet. In addition to the sawmill, a railroad switch yard, mill pond, tramways, boarding houses, machine shops, barns, offices, school, general store, railroad station and houses were constructed. The buildings were constructed of milled lumber and tarpaper.History of Fredric, Michigan Crawford County, May 15, 1977, published by the Friends of the Fredric Community Library By 1912, all 70,000 acres of the Ward estate had been clearcut and there was no more timber for the sawmill. The sawmill was dismantled and sold. The town of Deward began its return to nature. Michigan Central Railroad On May 1, 1907, the Michigan Central Railroad purchased all the capital stock of the Detroit & Charlevoix Railroad.Moody‚Äôs Manual of Railroads and Corporate Securities Issue 1918, Volume 19, Part 3, published by Poor‚Äôs & Moody‚Äôs On September 27, 1912, The Detroit & Charlevoix Railroad was merged into the Michigan Central. They valued the cost of acquisition at $518,735.86 and showed an operating loss of $5,428.91 for 1916.\\"SEVENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS for THE MICHIGAN CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY TO THE STOCKHOLDERS\\", December 31, 1916, published by the Michigan Central Railroad Company. The Detroit & Charlevoix Railroad name was dropped and the line was known as the East Jordan Branch.

Benton in Shreveport and Bossier City in northwestern Louisiana. In operation from at least 1897, it ceased publication in 1991. History The name The Journal was adopted on February 17, 1897. Previously the publication had been known for several years as The Judge. William E. Hamilton, another of several early owners, obtained the newspaper about 1900 and held it until 1911, when it was acquired by the Journal Publishing Company, with A. J. Frantz as the president and Douglas F. Attaway, Sr., as secretary. By 1918, Attaway had acquired controlling interest; in 1925, he became the president and publisher. Upon the senior Attaway's death in 1957, his son, Douglas F. \\"Doug\\" Attaway, Jr., succeeded his father as both the president and publisher. Attaway graduated with a journalism degree from the University of Missouri in Columbia. From 1966 to 1979, he was also the chairman of the board of KSLA-TV, the CBS affiliate established in 1954 and the first television outlet in Shreveport. Attaway sold KSLA to Viacom. He was also a former chairman of the board of Newspaper Production Company and the Attaway Newspaper Group, Inc.John Andrew Prime, \\"Former Journal publisher dies at age 83\\", Shreveport Times, February 22, 1994 In 1972, Attaway wrote an article on a total eclipse, the phenomenon in which the moon totally blocks the rays of the sun, which occurred on July 10 of that year. Attaway and his long-term photo editor, Jack Barham, journeyed to New York City to observe the two-minute eclipse, having found their desirable spot of view under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. In 1974, Attaway recruited Stanley R. Tiner from the rival Shreveport Times to become the editor of The Journal. A Webster Parish native reared in Shreveport, Tiner graduated with a journalism degree from Louisiana Tech University. In 1976, Attaway sold The Journal to the Shreveport industrialist and philanthropist Charles T. Beaird, who had served in the late 1950s as a Republican for one term on the former Caddo Parish Police Jury. Tiner and Beaird moved the editorial position of The Journal to the political left, whereas it had been clearly conservative and earlier segregationist under Attaway and a previous editor, George W. Shannon.\\"Tiner announces candidacy for post representing District 4\\", Minden Press-Herald, December 15, 1987, p. 10 The Times and The Journal once shared a building at 222 Lake Street, although they were separately owned and editorially independent. The Times remains at the Lake Street location, but has moved operations to an adjacent building in recent years. Closure in 1991 On January 29, 1991, Beaird announced that The Journal would terminate its daily operations two months later on March 30. The publication had steadily lost circulation and hence critical advertising revenues during the preceding decade. Readership dropped from a peak of nearly 40,000 to barely 16,000. \\"There just comes a time when it becomes uneconomical to go on. It was a very tough, sad decision,\\" Beaird said.\\"Shreveport Journal ends publication after 96 years\\", Minden Press- Herald, March 31, 1991, p. 1 Though The Journal had closed as a daily paper in 1991, Beaird contracted an agreement with The Times to carry on its op-ed page called \\"Journal Page\\", which permitted continuing editorial comment approved by Beaird and managed by his editor, Jim Montgomery (1945‚Äì2013), also a native of Webster Parish. The \\"Journal Page\\" finally ended its run on December 31, 1999. Under Beaird, The Journal won several important prizes, including the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Coverage of the Disadvantaged by the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Mass Media Gold Medallion for stories on African American history, and the Scripps-Howard National Journalism Awards for Editorial Writing. \\"Journal Page\\" was a finalist in 1994 for a Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Writing for a series on decriminalization of narcotics.Beaird obituary, Shreveport Times, April 20, 2006 Years later in 2006, Stanley Tiner's staff at The Sun Herald in Biloxi-Gulfport, Mississippi, won a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its reporting of Hurricane Katrina the previous year.The Pulitzer Prizes for 1970 Notable people In addition to the aforementioned George Shannon, Stanley Tiner, and Jack Barham, other notable Journal staffers include: *Craig Flournoy, reporter in the 1970s *Bob Griffin, travel author in the 1960s and 1970s while sports editor at KSLA-TV *Bill Keith, former city editor, later Shreveport Times investigative reporter, and member of the Louisiana State Senate *Robert \\"Bob\\" Mann, reporter (early 1980s); currently holds the Douglas Manship Chair of Journalism at LSU in Baton Rouge; inductee of the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame *Rupert Peyton, city editor of The Journal from 1925 to 1940; former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives; strongly anti-Long politicianWilliam McCleary, \\"Remembering Rupert Peyton (1899‚Äì1982) Journalist and State Representative, North Louisiana History, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Winter 2009), p. 22 References Category:Defunct newspapers published in Louisiana Category:Newspapers published in Louisiana Category:Publications established in 1897 Category:Publications disestablished in 1991 Category:Caddo Parish, Louisiana Category:Mass media in Shreveport, Louisiana ","title":"Shreveport Journal"},{"id":"37913170","text":"Chahu-ye Sharqi (, also Romanized as ChƒÅh≈´-ye Sharqƒ´) is a village in Dulab Rural District, Shahab District, Qeshm County, Hormozgan Province, Iran.

It is mentioned in dance manuals from France and Italy, and is mentioned in sources from Spain and England, as well,Julia Sutton, \\"Canary,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 50. including in plays by William Shakespeare.Alan Brissenden, Shakespeare and the Dance (Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1981), pp. 38-39, 53. The dance, which is most often choreographed for a single couple, has been characterized as \\"a fiery wooing dance\\" with either Canary origins or at least a Canary flavor from its \\"rapid heel-and-toe stamps\\" and distinctive music.Sutton, \\"Canary,\\" vol. 2, p. 50. It was also called frogs legs, because it was an energetic dance that featured jumps, stamping of the feet and violent movement, accompanied by music with syncopated rhythms. While there are choreographies for the canario as a stand-alone dance in the dancing manuals of Fabritio Caroso, Cesare Negri, and Thoinot Arbeau,Thoinot Arbeau, Orchesography, transl. Mary S. Evans, ed. Julia Sutton (New York: Dover, 1967), pp. 179-181. it most frequently appears as a section of a larger dance or suite of dances.Sutton, \\"Canary,\\" vol. 2, pp. 50-52. Several Baroque composers (notably J.S. Bach) used the distinctive rhythm of the canary in a few pieces, such as the gigue of the French Suite in C Minor, and it also appears in one of the Goldberg Variations (Variation 7).

He was a founding member and first president of the Exposition Cotton Mills, which was founded in 1882. By 1890, it had 500 employees and had spun fifty million yards of yarn. Along with his brothers he was an investor in the Atlanta Steel and Hoop Company, later known as Atlantic Steel. It was Atlanta's first steel hoop mill. Hugh founded clothing manufacturer Inman, Smith and Company with his son, Edward, in 1896. By 1902 it had 300 employees and was producing 1000 pairs of pants per day. Hugh and son, Edward, provided financial support and were vice- presidents of Atlanta Woolen Mills, which had 450 employees in 1902 and did yearly business amounting to $500,000. He owned the Kimball House Hotel in downtown Atlanta which he gave as a wedding gift to daughter Annie and son-in- law John W. Grant. His son, Edward Hamilton Inman, owned the Swan House (Atlanta). At the time of his death he had amassed an estate exceeding $2,000,000 (approx. $54 million USD in 2019 adjusted for inflation) making him the wealthiest man in the state. In August 1910 he went to a sanitarium in New York City suffering from neurasthenia and died there three months later of pneumonia.

She was the first female member of a New Zealand hospital board. Early life Stewart was born in Sydney in 1840. Her parents were Martha Piotti and Stephen Carkeek, the commander of the revenue cutter Ranger. In 1842 the family moved to Nelson, New Zealand, where her brother Arthur Carkeek was born, and they moved again to Wellington in 1849 when her father was promoted to collector of customs. In 1865, she married the engineer and surveyor John Tiffin Stewart. In 1870 the Stewarts moved to Foxton, where Frances gave birth to five daughters and five sons. Advocacy Stewart was a prominent social activist who advocated for numerous causes, particularly women's rights and children's health and education. After John Stewart retired in 1889, the family moved to Wanganui, where both Frances and John became important members of the community by hosting parties, fundraising, and leading community organisations. Frances Stewart was involved in the founding of the Protestant- run Wanganui Orphanage in 1889 and, following her infant grandson's serious illness and successful treatment in 1909, dedicated their house to children's healthcare; it became the Stewart Karitane Home. She also donated land to establish the Wanganui Girls' College and was appointed the superintendent of a system of Sunday schools in Wanganui. Stewart fought for women's right to participate in public activities, including politics, education, and church affairs. In 1896 she nominated herself for election to the Wanganui Borough Council with a view to ultimately being elected to the Wanganui Hospital Board. Although she was not elected to the council, in 1897 and 1898 she was appointed to the Wanganui and Marton Hospital Boards, making her the first female member of a hospital board in New Zealand. Although she retired in 1899, citing the difficulty of achieving progress as the lone woman board member, she was reappointed to the Wanganui board for a year in 1903. In 1910, the first year that board members were elected rather than appointed, she ran again, and although she was unsuccessful she later said: \\"I consider myself a pioneer for my own sex, hoping that other women will have the courage to come forward the next time there is an election.\\" She was a frequent letter writer to local newspapers, often using pseudonyms such as \\"A Mother\\", \\"Indignant Mother\\", and \\"Vox\\". Although Stewart was a suffragist, she believed that the vote should not be granted indiscriminately to all women, that women's education should focus on preparing them to be decent wives and mothers, and that granting women economic independence would lead to \\"plenty of domestic unhappiness\\". Later years in Whanganui Stewart House was the home of John Tiffin Stewart and Frances Ann Stewart and is located in Plymouth Street Whanganui. It is now a private home but it is remembered as the Karitane Home and later as the boarding residence for secondary school students. Death Stewart died in her Wanganui home on 12 November 1916.

It is an attempt to add some isochronous capability to the kernel by hinting at what time a packet should be sent out. When sending a packet to socket, an additional bit (MSG_LAUNCHTIME) is specified in the \\"sendto\\" flags field. If this bit is set, then the buffer passed to the socket includes the desired send time or \\"launch time\\". The sendto syscall will shave off the launchtime from the packet and add it to the msghdr passed to the lower layers of the network stack. The UDP + IPv4/IPv6 are planned to be extended to support this, and if launchtime is requested, they will try to call a new send message routine in the network driver which allows passing the launchtime parameter, in addition to those of the normal send message present in the driver. Before Launch time is used the network driver will have to be initialized using an ioctl. Support Very few network controllers support launchtime today. The Intel i210 Gigabit Ethernet controller does, but there is no support in the igb driver as of December 2012. Launch time can be supported in FPGA based network cards, but it is not common for TCP/IP Offload Engines to support launch time.

After being performed on tour and released on multiple live albums, a studio recording was released for the first time on Wrecking Ball in 2012. The song was written prior to the 1999‚Äì2000 E Street Band reunion tour, and appeared on the Live in New York City album from that tour. It was also used as the theme song of the MLB on TBS coverage for the postseason in the 2012 Major League Baseball season. History The song's origins date to 1998 or early 1999, when it was first written, although the mandolin riff first appeared on the song \\"Labor of Love\\" on Joe Gruscheky's 1995 album American Babylon that Springsteen played on. It came during the close of a decade in which Springsteen had parted ways with the E Street Band, gotten married again and had children, and had released very little new music in a rock vein. He later said, \\"I was having a hard time locating my rock voice. I knew I didn't want it to be what it was, but I didn't know ... I'd made some records over the past years, I made one in '94 that I didn't release. Then I made a series of demos, kind of in search of that voice. And I was having a hard time finding it. And there was a point I said: 'Well, gee, maybe I just don't do that now. Maybe that's something that I did.'\\" But after writing \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", he felt it was \\"as good as any songs like this that I've ever written. It was like, there's that voice I was looking for.\\" The song was first heard by outsiders in March 1999 during preparations for the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour. During a series of private rehearsals at Asbury Park, New Jersey's Convention Hall, several dozen of the Springsteen faithful, eager with anticipation at what the long-awaited reunion might bring, stood outside the hall on the cold and windy boardwalk and beach to hear what they could from inside the walls and reporting their findings on several Springsteen Internet forums. It was during one of these rehearsals that fans first heard run-throughs of what they called \\"The Train Song\\" or \\"This Train\\". When the first public rehearsal performance at Convention Hall was given on March 18, 1999, and then when the tour actually opened on April 9 at Barcelona's Palau Sant Jordi, the song became the tour's closing epic \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\". Indeed, the one newly written song to be featured during most of the tour, and closing the shows for much of it, was \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\".Marsh, Bruce Springsteen On Tour, pp. 230, 234. Musically based in part around The Impressions' \\"People Get Ready\\", written by Curtis Mayfield, but set to a loud guitar churn with a sometimes-heard mandolin riff from Steven Van Zandt, lyrically it was a deliberate inversion of the traditional American gospel song first recorded in the 1920s, \\"This Train\\", also known as \\"This Train Is Bound for Glory\\".Marsh, Bruce Springsteen On Tour, p. 235. (The song is often associated with Woody Guthrie, as the inspiration for his 1943 autobiography Bound for Glory, but to music writer Dave Marsh, Springsteen's song was based more off of Sister Rosetta Tharpe's rendition.) In Springsteen's take, all are welcome on the train - not just \\"the righteous and the holy\\" of the original, but \\"saints and sinners\\", \\"losers and winners\\", \\"whores and gamblers\\" - you just get on board.Springsteen: Saint In The City: 1949-1974 by Craig Statham. Soundcheck Books, 2013. . Stretched to eight or more minutes, with several false endings, \\"Lohad\\" (as it soon became known to fans in shorthand) represented the culmination of the tour's message of rock and roll revival. :Well, you don't know where you're goin' now :But you know you won't be back :I said this train ... :Dreams will not be thwarted; :This train ... :Faith will be rewarded Entertainment Weekly called the song \\"pure secular gospel\\", helping to promote the outing \\"as much [of a] traveling tent revival as reunion tour,\\" and suggested that churches would be lucky to have as feverish an audience response as Springsteen received in his concerts. While it was unusual for almost every show on the tour to end with a new, unreleased song, The New York Times felt it \\"was a very appropriate and telling conclusion to the show, a happy ending of sorts to the preceding tales of characters trying to navigate their way through a morally, financially and emotionally uncertain world, weighing their dreams against their reality and trying to decide which path to follow.\\" \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" represented a thematic strain in Springsteen's work. Author Louis P. Masur wrote that in a sense, the song represented a return to the motifs of the 1975 Born to Run album with the \\"But you know you won't be back\\" line, but that overall the song had a more optimistic view.Masur, Runaway Dream, p. 167. Author Jimmy Guterman traced it back even further, to the all-is-forgiven, magical-city universe of 1973's \\"New York City Serenade\\", and forward to the 2002 album The Rising.Guterman, Runaway American Dream, p. 77. Author Eric Alterman wrote that the song \\"somehow seemed to encapsulate twenty-five years of Springsteen songwriting\\" and in particular a moral from 1978's \\"Badlands\\": \\"It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive.\\"Alterman, It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive, pp. 274‚Äì276. 2000 live recording \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" was recorded during a performance at Madison Square Garden on July 1, 2000. Running 9:22 in length, this rendition was featured on the HBO film Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: Live in New York City, first broadcast on April 7, 2001. As an audio recording, it was included on accompanying CD release of the same name, on March 27, 2001, which reached number five on the Billboard 200 U.S. album chart. In reviewing the release, Entertainment Weekly said that the song \\"is Springsteen at his most movingly idealistic, with a gospel train replacing the old, youthful promise of escape on a motorbike.\\" Then, following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the same recording was included on the God Bless America charity album, released on October 16, 2001. The album, composed of a variety of patriotic, spiritual, and inspirational songs, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Finally, the performance was included in the DVD release of Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: Live in New York City on November 6, 2001. This live recording was reissued again as B-side for \\"The Rising\\" single in July 2002. Once more, it was included as the final track on the November 2003 compilation The Essential Bruce Springsteen, which reached number 14 on the Billboard 200 and number 28 on the UK Albums Chart. Subsequent live performance history On the 2002‚Äì2003 Rising Tour, the second encore of shows was a thematic one that typically centered around \\"My City of Ruins\\", \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", and a benedictory \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\". A performance of the song at Palau Sant Jordi from this tour on October 16, 2002, while not part of a live television broadcast of the first half of the show, was included on the November 2003 Live in Barcelona DVD release. The song was not played during the 2007‚Äì2008 Magic Tour, but returned during the first, North American leg of the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour. Those shows consistently featured \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" in the encore, immediately followed by Springsteen's other reunion-era encore epic of American struggle, survival and hope, \\"American Land\\". By now the usage of these songs had been so commonplace that The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that the pair together \\"were spirited, even if they're starting to feel like overused leftovers from previous tours.\\" Partway through the second, European leg of the tour, \\"Lohad\\" was dropped from the setlist, and appeared only rarely through the rest of the tour. The song was performed during Jon Stewart's final episode of The Daily Show as Stewart's \\"Moment of Zen\\". The Springsteen on Broadway acoustic live version was released as a single.https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/land-of-hope-and-dreams-springsteen- on-broadway-single/1440063456 First studio version A studio version may have been originally recorded in 2002 during the sessions for The Rising album, although if so, it was never released. Springsteen's 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6, 2012. Three songs previously only available as live versions, including \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", appear on the album. However, none of the studio work was able to include longtime saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who died in June 2011. For \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", producer Ron Aniello used a live recording of Clemon's saxophone solo and inserted it into a new studio recording. Springsteen commented that as he first heard the combined version being played back, \\"When the solo section hit, Clarence's sax filled the room. I cried.\\" That it was possibly Clemons' last appearance on a Springsteen album was seen as a tribute to the departed foil. Writer and broadcaster Will Hermes said, \\"It's an object lesson in the sort of hard-bitten pop optimism that Springsteen's made into a secular religion, and it's also a fitting farewell to a friend.\\" The track contains religious themes and more hopeful outlook with its uplifting lyrics and chorus that use an extensive train metaphor to express Springsteen's take on the American dream. \\"This train/dreams will not be thwarted/this train/faith will be rewarded,\\" he sings. The song ends with a gospel choir singing excerpts from The Impressions' \\"People Get Ready\\" and Springsteen repeating \\"you just get on board/you just thank the Lord.\\" Compared to its previous live version, which the E Street Band has been performing since 1999, it has been re-worked in a somewhat more compact version and now features electronic drums and the aforementioned use of a gospel choir. Not everyone was pleased. The Washington Post wrote upon the album's release that \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" came across as a pose, and that \\"Cartoonishly austere American clich√©s, all aboard!\\" Similarly, Entertainment Weekly saw the song as having a similar issue as the rest of the album: \\"The images are so broad ‚Äì every song's got a rising flood or a train of sinners or a dead man's moon ‚Äì you'll be dying for a detail that's anchored in the real world, circa 2012.\\" So did The Guardian: \\"There's something equally improbable about Wrecking Ball as a whole. On paper, it all looks a bit much, and occasionally it is ‚Äì a sense of 'oh do give it a rest' sets in around the sixth overwrought minute of 'Land of Hope and Dreams' ...\\". Political, charitable, and other use Going back to 2004, John Kerry had used \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" as introductory music for his presidential campaign, including at the July 2004 rally where he introduced John Edwards as his running mate. It was also used as the theme song of the MLB on TBS coverage for the postseason in the 2012 Major League Baseball season. Springsteen and the E Street Band performed \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" as the closing number of a one-hour telethon called Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together on November 2, 2012, which aired on NBC and many other channels. Rolling Stone commented that the song had by then \\"become the rock & roll ambassador's default tune for the dispossessed.\\" On December 12, 2012, Springsteen and the E Street Band opened the 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief benefit with the same song, presenting what the Associated Press called \\"a roar and call to arms\\". Rock writer and Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh calls one of his Sirius XM Radio shows the political talk show Live From the Land of Hopes and Dreams, airs Sunday afternoons on Sirius Left, channel 146 and America Left, channel 167 on XM Satellite Radio. Springsteen and the E Street Band performed the song on the final episode (Stewart's final 'Moment of Zen') of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in 2015. A recording of the song was played after the end of President Barack Obama's farewell address in January 2017. In the live performance of this song on 27 January 2017 at the Perth Arena, Springsteen added the line \\"this train carries immigrants\\". At the time Donald Trump was reviewing his stance on immigration from Muslim countries.

The IBA is an important breeding site for south polar skuas The Cierva Point and offshore islands Important Bird Area is a 6540 ha tract of land and sea on the Danco Coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Description The Important Bird Area (IBA) lies 50 km to the east of Brabant Island, with Cierva Point forming both the northwest extremity of Sladun Peninsula and the south side of the entrance to Cierva Cove. The IBA is defined by the same boundary as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 134) which includes Cierva Point, Midas Island, Sterneck Island, Moss Islands and other offshore islands as well as the intervening sea and intertidal zone. At Cierva Point the south-facing slopes are glaciated, whilst the north- and west-facing slopes are ice-free. The land rises to over 500 m at the coastal cliffs. The Argentine Primavera Station lies close to the IBA boundary on the northern tip of Cierva Point. Flora and fauna The site was designated an ASPA for the great scientific value of its unusual biodiversity, including many species of plants, birds, and invertebrates. The unique topography, with the abundance and diversity of the vegetation, have created favourable conditions for the formation of numerous microhabitats. The extensive coastal vegetation includes lichens, mosses and grasses, with Antarctic hairgrass and Antarctic pearlwort. The mineral soils contain cyanobacteria and diatoms. Terrestrial arthropods and non-marine microalgae are abundant. Birds The site has been identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports about 500 breeding pairs of south polar skuas. Other birds recorded as nesting there include imperial shags, southern giant petrels, chinstrap and gentoo penguins, Wilson's storm petrels, Cape petrels, snow petrels, kelp gulls, Antarctic terns and snowy sheathbills.

Polyploidy (wholesale genome duplication) is common in plants and constitutes an important method of speciation.Werth, C. and M. Whindam (1991) A Model for Divergent, Allopatric Speciation of Polyploid Pteridophytes Resulting from Silencing of Duplicate Gene Expression. American Naturalist 137: 515-526 When a polyploid species arises, its genome contains homeologs, duplicated chromosomes with equivalent genetic information. However silencing of redundant genes occurs rapidly in new polyploids through genetic and epigenetic means. This primarily occurs because redundancy allows one of the two genes present for each locus to be silenced without affecting the phenotype of the organism, and thus mutations that eliminate gene expression are much less likely to be deleterious or lethal.Pikaard, C. S (2001) Genomic change and gene silencing in polyploids. Trends in Genetics 12:675-677 This allows mutations that would be lethal in diploid populations to accumulate in polyploids. Reciprocal silencing refers to the specific pattern of silencing where equivalent loci in are both silenced and expressed in a reciprocal manner. This phenomenon is observed on two distinct scales. Reciprocal silencing between populations  Allopolyploids are species whose increased complement of genetic material is the result of hybridization of two closely related species. Thus homeologous chromosomes in allopolyploids are equivalent, but not identical. These differences mean that the precise pattern of silencing and expression can have important phenotypic effects. Reciprocal silencing on the population level refers to the case where two populations are each descended from the same allopolyploid. In one population, one of the two equivalent locci (A) is expressed while the other (B) has been silenced, while in the other population the reciprocal pattern occurs, with B being expressed and A silenced. It is important to note that this refers to equivalent loci, specific locations within the genome, rather than the entire homeologous chromosome. Reciprocal silencing on the population level has been proposed as a means of allopatric speciation following a polyploid event. Allopatric speciation occurs when two populations of the same species become spatially separated and accumulate enough genetic differences to lose the ability to interbreed. As redundant genes are silenced in allopolyploids there is the potential for rapid genetic differences to accumulate through reciprocal silencing. These differences can lead to the loss of ability to interbreed between separated populations at a faster rate than other methods of speciation, given the relative speed with which genes are silenced following a polyploid event. Faster still, redundant genes can be silenced through epigenetic means, although the importance of this phenomenon is not fully understood. Reciprocal silencing between tissues Reciprocal silencing on the tissue level refers to the same pattern of silencing and expression of homeologous loci. However in this case, the differences in silencing and expression occur between two types of tissue within the same individual, rather than in individuals of different populations. This is an example of neofunctionalization, a process where duplicated genes that were once at equivalent loci evolve to carry out two separate functions.Chaudhary, B. Flagel, L. Stupar, R. Udal, J. Verma, N. Springer, N. and J. F. Wendel (2009) Reciprocal Silencing, Transcriptional Bias and Functional Divergens of Homeologs in Polyploid Cotton (Gossypium). Genetics 183: 503-517 Since different tissues require different genes to be expressed, reciprocal silencing can occur between tissues. Importantly, while the pattern of gene expression is the same as in the population case, the genetic means by which this pattern is achieved are very different. While silencing mutations are thought to be the main source of reciprocal silencing at the population level, at the tissue level only epigenetic factors are in play, since expressible copies of both homeologous loci must exist in all cells in an individual if different tissues express different homeologs.

SELM is a hybrid approach utilizing an Eulerian description for the continuum hydrodynamic fields and a Lagrangian description for elastic structures. Thermal fluctuations are introduced through stochastic driving fields. The SELM fluid-structure equations typically used are : \\\\rho \\\\frac{d{u}}{d{t}} = \\\\mu \\\\, \\\\Delta u - abla p + \\\\Lambda[\\\\Upsilon(V - \\\\Gamma{u})] + \\\\lambda + f_\\\\mathrm{thm}(x,t) : m\\\\frac{d{V}}{d{t}} = -\\\\Upsilon(V - \\\\Gamma{u}) - abla \\\\Phi[X] + \\\\xi + F_\\\\mathrm{thm} : \\\\frac{d{X}}{d{t}} = V. The pressure p is determined by the incompressibility condition for the fluid : abla \\\\cdot u = 0. \\\\, The \\\\Gamma, \\\\Lambda operators couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian degrees of freedom. The X, V denote the composite vectors of the full set of Lagrangian coordinates for the structures. The \\\\Phi is the potential energy for a configuration of the structures. The f_\\\\mathrm{thm}, F_\\\\mathrm{thm} are stochastic driving fields accounting for thermal fluctuations. The \\\\lambda, \\\\xi are Lagrange multipliers imposing constraints, such as local rigid body deformations. To ensure that dissipation occurs only through the \\\\Upsilon coupling and not as a consequence of the interconversion by the operators \\\\Gamma,\\\\Lambda the following adjoint conditions are imposed : \\\\Gamma = \\\\Lambda^T. Thermal fluctuations are introduced through Gaussian random fields with mean zero and the covariance structure : \\\\langle f_\\\\mathrm{thm}(s)f^T_\\\\mathrm{thm}(t) \\\\rangle = -\\\\left(2k_B{T}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\mu \\\\Delta - \\\\Lambda \\\\Upsilon\\\\Gamma\\\\right)\\\\delta(t - s). : \\\\langle F_\\\\mathrm{thm}(s)F^T_\\\\mathrm{thm}(t) \\\\rangle = 2k_B{T}\\\\Upsilon\\\\delta(t - s). : \\\\langle f_\\\\mathrm{thm}(s)F^T_\\\\mathrm{thm}(t) \\\\rangle = -2k_B{T}\\\\Lambda\\\\Upsilon\\\\delta(t - s). To obtain simplified descriptions and efficient numerical methods, approximations in various limiting physical regimes have been considered to remove dynamics on small time-scales or inertial degrees of freedom. In different limiting regimes, the SELM framework can be related to the immersed boundary method, accelerated Stokesian dynamics, and arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method. The SELM approach has been shown to yield stochastic fluid-structure dynamics that are consistent with statistical mechanics. In particular, the SELM dynamics have been shown to satisfy detailed-balance for the Gibbs‚ÄìBoltzmann ensemble. Different types of coupling operators have also been introduced allowing for descriptions of structures involving generalized coordinates and additional translational or rotational degrees of freedom.

Career Dallow joined the New Zealand Police in the late 1940s. He commenced duty as a constable in Police street patrols in Auckland and noticed how high the number of MƒÅori offenders was and how much Police work was devoted to them.Susan Butterworth, p. 254. In 1969, Dallow, as Superintendent, was appointed as the Police representative on the joint committee of Government Officials and the New Zealand MƒÅori Council to discuss the interaction of the Police and the MƒÅori Wardens established under the Maori Welfare Act 1962. This resulted in increased cooperation between the bodies.Susan Butterworth, p. 242. In the 1970s, Dallow, as Chief Superintendent, was a member of the Police National Headquarters planning team for the 1973 Springbok tour (which in the end did not take place). He saw the possibility of utilising the training in crowd control for that tour to deal with increasing levels of street violence, especially in Auckland, which followed the extension of liquor-licensing laws from 1968. \\"Operation Cleanstreet\\" was set up to test these techniques.Susan Butterworth, pp. 161, 192 and 193. Following on from this, in 1974, Dallow was instrumental in setting up the Task Force to deal with street disorder among the large MƒÅori and Pacific communities that had migrated to South Auckland.Susan Butterworth, p. 247. In 1977, Dallow was placed in charge of the new Public Affairs Directorate in Police National Headquarters.Susan Butterworth, p. 248. In 1981, Dallow, then Assistant Commissioner of Police and having responsibility for Police training and personnel, introduced martial arts into the training of the New Zealand Police. He was a martial arts practitioner himself.Susan Butterworth, p. 200. After his retirement, Dallow was a keen exponent of ballroom dancing, especially the Tango, and he taught dancing in Wellington.Wellington Tango School (Retrieved 23 January 2014) In the 1979 New Year Honours, Dallow was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

Sections The sections of the novel found on Bola√±o's computer were organized into four numbered folders each with a title and page count: # Amalfitano and Padilla, 165 pages # Rosa Amalfitano, 39 pages # Pancho Monje, 26 pages # J.M.G.

Another folder titled \\"Cowboy Graveyard\\" contained 8 more chapters.Carolina L√≥pez, \\"Editorial Note\\", Woes of the True Policeman, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012. page 249. In the published novel the material was arranged into five sections: I. The Fall of the Berlin Wall To avoid a scandal involving his homosexual relationships with the poet Padilla and others, √ìscar Amalfitano is forced to resign from the University of Barcelona and moves with his daughter Rosa to Santa Teresa, Mexico. While the general outline is similar to Amalfitano's story in 2666, there are major differences including his being a widower (in 2666 his wife had run off), his alienation from his daughter, and his homosexual tendencies. II. Amalfitano and Padilla Amalfitano settles in Santa Teresa, meets the painter Castillo, and exchanges letters with Padilla. III. Rosa Amalfitano Rosa's new life in Santa Teresa. IV. J.M.G. Archimboldi A review of Archimboldi's life and works, including a bibliography, summaries of 7 novels, and short chapters on his friendships, epistolary relationships, hobbies, and enemies. There are significant differences between this character and 2666's Benno von Archimboldi, not the least of which are their different nationalities (French and German, respectively). V.

In a list produced by convicted fraudster Chris Fay, several prominent British men were alleged to have engaged in sexual abuse and child grooming at the Guest House in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Labour MP Tom Watson, having heard testimony from Carl Beech, suggested in an October 2012 statement to the House of Commons that a paedophile network which had existed at this time may have brought children to parties at the private residence. During 2014 and 2015, allegations against several leading politicians of the period, mostly now deceased, were made public in the British press. Many of these claims were examined and discredited in an October 2015 episode of the BBC current affairs television programme, Panorama. The role of the guest house became the subject of a Metropolitan Police Service investigation known as Operation Fairbank in late 2012. The purpose of this \\"scoping exercise\\" was to assess Watson's claims. As a result of allegations arising from Operation Fairbank, a full criminal investigation called Operation Fernbridge was launched in February 2013. No evidence of abuse connected to the Elm Guest House was uncovered, and the operation was closed in March 2015. Another investigation, Operation Midland, was set up to examine claims of possible homicide. A subsequent inquiry found that those investigated by Operation Midland had been victims of false allegations. In November 2016, the then- Metropolitan Police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, made a personal apology to the innocent parties involved. In May 2019, Beech was placed on trial, charged with perverting the course of justice and fraud, which he denied. Beech was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years in jail in July 2019. Elm Guest House The three-storey Elm Guest House was in Rocks Lane, close to Barnes Common in southwest London. It had eight guest rooms, and its facilities included a sauna, solarium and video studio. The Edwardian house has since been converted into two-bedroom apartments, and the current occupants are not connected to the allegations. In the 1970s, Elm Guest House owners Haroon and Carole Kasir allowed male prostitutes to take their clients to the establishment. A party was raided by the police in 1982 and the Kasirs were charged with running a disorderly house. The identities of the men who attended the party are not known and have been the subject of much speculation in subsequent years. By 2012, The Independent described the house as a \\"conspiracy theorist's dream\\". Carole Kasir died in 1990 at the age of 47; an inquest found that the cause of Kasir's death was suicide due to an overdose of insulin. Background History of claims In 1990, according to journalist James Hanning, Chris Fay, a Labour councillor, convicted fraudster and a campaigner for the National Association of Young People in Care, claimed on oath that former Home Secretary Leon Brittan had been involved in abuse and that in March 1990 he had seen a photograph of Brittan with a young boy. He said the picture had been shown to him by Carole Kasir, co-owner of the Elm Guest House, who died weeks later. Fay alleged that children from the Grafton Close Children's Home in Richmond, southwest London, had told him they had been trafficked to Elm Guest House. He drew up a list of public figures that he said victims had told him had stayed at the Elm Guest House. The list included former government ministers, senior MPs, top police officers, judges, pop music stars, and people with links to the Royal Households. It was uploaded to the internet. In the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal in October 2012, Labour MP Tom Watson said in the House of Commons he had evidence that there was a \\"powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and Number 10\\". Watson made his comments after having been passed information from the investigative news website Exaro. With the public upset that Jimmy Savile was never properly investigated over his alleged crimes, the Metropolitan Police launched Operation Fairbank as a scoping exercise to examine Watson's claims. Watson set up a meeting with Fay, journalist Eileen Fairweather and child protection officer Peter McKelvie to discuss the allegations in 2013; Fay was dis-invited before the meeting after concerns were raised about his reliability. After the meeting, Watson was warned about the reliability of the accusations. In July 2014, a journalist from Exaro introduced Watson to Carl Beech, who falsely accused Brittan and others of abuse. Watson wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions to reopen a separate rape investigation into Brittan that police had previously closed after finding no evidence to support the claim and \\"glaring inconsistencies\\" in the accuser's account. Police ultimately decided that Brittan would face no further action but he was never told he would not be charged before his death in January 2015. After Brittan's death, Watson wrote a newspaper column in which he quoted Beech, calling Brittan \\"as close to evil as a human being could get\\". Claims are challenged and discredited In an edition of Panorama broadcast on 6 October 2015, a former Elm Guest House prostitute was interviewed who claimed that he was unaware of any MPs visiting the brothel. UK journalist John Oakes told them he had investigated Chris Fay's claims, but had never been able to find any \\"solid\\" information nor trace of photos Fay said he had seen. A man named Mark stated that he had been an abuse victim at Grafton Close but had never been to Elm Guest House and had never spoken to Fay. Another person interviewed by Panorama said they named Brittan as their abuser only after being pressured by Fay.BBC Panorama - The VIP Paedophile Ring: What's the Truth? (6 October 2015) - 14:49 to 20:38; iPlayer link The Daily Telegraph later reported that Fay had been jailed for fraud in 2011. Fay said he regretted starting a \\"witch-hunt\\".Evans, Martin (7 October 2015). \\"Man behind Leon Brittan allegations regrets 'witch-hunt'\\". The Daily Telegraph. London. Retrieved 2 September 2017. In late 2015, Watson was criticised for consistently refusing to comment after it was revealed that the police had been pressured into investigating rape allegations against Brittan by Watson. That November, Watson apologised to Brittan's widow and her family for the distress caused by the investigation. Metropolitan police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe issued an apology of his own in February 2016 for mishandling the investigation. Criminal investigations Operation Fairbank The police investigation known as Operation Fairbank was first set up under conditions of secrecy. The Independent on Sunday reported that it focused on claims of sexual abuse and the grooming of children, involving parties for men at the former Elm Guest House. Police also investigated allegations that in the early 1980s a \\"paedophile ring of VIPs\\" abused boys from the Grafton Close Children's Home. According to The Daily Telegraph, Operation Fairbank caused much speculation on the internet but made little progress in exposing the alleged paedophile ring. Operation Fernbridge A full criminal investigation, Operation Fernbridge, was launched as a result of allegations that arose from Operation Fairbank. Operation Fernbridge investigated allegations concerning both Grafton Close children's home and Elm Guest House. Two men connected to the Grafton Close children's home: Tony McSweeney, a Catholic priest from Norwich, and John Stingemore, a former children's home manager, were arrested on suspicion of sexual offences and questioned by child investigation officers from Operation Fernbridge in February 2013. A trial against Tony McSweeney started at Southwark Crown Court in February 2015. However, John Stingemore was found dead at his home in January 2015 whilst still awaiting trial. McSweeney was later convicted of his charges and sentenced to prison. Although arrests from Operation Fernbridge did result in a conviction stemming from Grafton Close children's home, it did not expose abuse related to Elm Guest House. After McSweeny's conviction, Operation Fernbridge was closed and investigations related to Elm Guest House were taken over by Operation Athabasca. Operation Midland In July 2014, Exaro began publishing articles in which Carl Beech, then known publicly under the pseudonym \\"Nick\\", falsely accused prominent men of having abused him. Four months later, Beech told Operation Fairbank detectives that he had been abused by a VIP gang of paedophiles for over a decade at various locations, including at the Elm Guest House and Dolphin Square, and that he had witnessed them murder three boys. The murders of Vishal Mehrotra, Martin Allen and another boy were subsequently investigated as part of Operation Midland. Based only on Beech's claims, Operation Midland investigated Edward Heath, Leon Brittan, Edwin Bramall, Harvey Proctor and others. An inquiry conducted by Richard Henriques found that those accused had been victims of false allegations and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Hogan-Howe subsequently apologised to the living suspects (Bramall and Proctor) and Brittan's widow. In May 2019, Beech was placed on trial, charged with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud, which he denied. Before his trial started, Beech pleaded guilty to child pornography offences. Beech had been viewing, downloading and creating child abuse images during the same period in which he had been lying to police. On 22 July 2019, Beech was found guilty of making up the Westminster VIP paedophile ring. He was jailed for 18 years on 26 July.

The killings occurred after Yugoslav troops withdrew from the region in the aftermath of the Kosovo War, and was the worst single crime in Kosovo since the conflict ended in June 1999. The perpetrators of the killings have never been captured. Background The Kosovo War ended on 11 June 1999 with the Yugoslav army (VJ) agreeing to withdraw its forces from Kosovo after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign. As many as 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers subsequently left Kosovo and were replaced by an estimated 50,000 NATO troops, while 170,000 Kosovar Serbs fled to Central Serbia. Although the village of Staro Gracko, with a population of 300, was predominantly inhabited by ethnic Serbs and was home to eighty Serb and two Kosovo Albanian families, surrounding villages were inhabited by ethnic Albanians. Massacre On 23 July 1999, at approximately 9:13pm, British KFOR troops heard gunfire and contacted a NATO reaction-force which hurried to the scene. The NATO soldiers subsequently discovered the bodies of thirteen Serbs next to a combine harvester by an open field. A fourteenth body was discovered lying on a tractor nearby. The farmers had been returning home after a day of harvesting wheat. When their corpses were discovered, it was reported that the men had been grouped together in a circle and shot dead. The bodies of some victims appeared to have been mutilated and disfigured with blunt instruments. The farmers had requested NATO protection seven days prior to the killings, but their pleas were ignored. Aftermath Massacre memorial After the fourteen bodies were discovered, Canadian troops cordoned off the village. The bodies were then taken to a hospital in Pristina to be identified. The United Nations stated that women and children were among the victims. Reaction Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Tha√ßi condemned the killings, calling them \\"[a] crazy act designed to wreck the improving relations between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs.\\" Bernard Kouchner, the head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), said that he was \\"horrified\\" by the massacre and promised to bring \\"the perpetrators to justice without delay.\\" Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), said that she was \\"gravely concerned\\" and called for \\"an immediate investigation into the massacre.\\" Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá blamed international peacekeeping forces for the massacre, while VJ General Neboj≈°a Pavkoviƒá threatened to send Yugoslav troops back into Kosovo if the United Nations were not able to control the province.

The group was led by the drug lords Jes√∫s Pe√±a (alias \\"El 20\\"), Jos√© Rodrigo Ar√©chiga Gamboa (alias \\"El Chino √Åntrax\\"), Ren√© Vel√°zquez Valenzuela (alias \\"El Sargento Phoenix\\"), among others, and they are responsible for a number of homicides and for providing armed security services to Ismael El Mayo Zambada. The gang operates in the capital city of Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, where its members conduct homicides and violent attacks. Etymology The name of the group is inspired from the bacterium spores anthrax, although the Sinaloa state authorities have never officially recognized the group's existence. History Los √Åntrax works as the security force of the drug lord Ismael El Mayo Zambada, who leads the Sinaloa Cartel along with Joaqu√≠n El Chapo Guzm√°n (now arrested). Several homicides have been attributed to the gang, which was led by a drug trafficker named Rodrigo Arechiga Gamboa (El Chino Antrax), who recently escaped U.S. custody, and his right-hand man Jesus Pe√±a (El 20). Pe√±a escaped from a prison in Sinaloa on March 16, 2017 with four other suspects, including alleged √Åntrax member Rafael Guadalupe F√©lix N√∫√±ez (alias \\"Changuito √Åntrax\\") and Juan Jos√© Esparragoza Monz√≥n, son of Juan Jos√© Esparragoza Moreno. Tubutama, Sonora shooting A fierce gunfight between members of the Sinaloa Cartel (with the backing of Los √Åntrax) and the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel (with the support of Los Zetas) left about 30 dead in the town of Tubutama, Sonora in northern Mexico on 1 July 2010. The drug gangs clashed just a few miles across the international border with the U.S. state of Arizona ‚Äì an area notorious for being a smuggling route for narcotics and human trafficking. Eleven late- model, bullet-ridden vehicles were found at the scene, along with dozens of high caliber assault rifles. Some of the vehicles had \\"X\\" painted on their windows, a method often used by the Mexican drug trafficking organizations to distinguish the vehicles of rival drug cartels during armed confrontations. Mexican Army torture allegations Los √Åntrax gained public attention on 26 May 2011, when a squadron of the Mexican Army that was patrolling a neighborhood in southern Culiac√°n spotted three vehicles with armed assailants. The encounter prompted a gunfight, but the Mexican forces managed to neutralize three members of Los √Åntrax; they also liberated three kidnapping victims from a safe house in the area (a woman; a man who had his toes and ears mutilated; and a 5-year-old girl). Although preliminary reports indicated that the three gunmen killed by the army ‚Äì Jes√∫s Humberto Corona Guill√©n, Franklin Olgu√≠n Vel√°zquez and Pedro Valenzuela Meza ‚Äì had died from gunshot wounds during the shootout, the post-mortem reports indicated that the gunmen had been beaten and tortured by the soldiers before being killed, even though the official account of the event was that they \\"died in a gun battle.\\" Assassination of Arce Rubio On 1 November 2011, during an indoor football game in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, an armed commando interrupted the game and killed Francisco Arce Rubio, the leader of Los √Åntrax. According to police reports, several armed men carrying AK-47s and handguns interrupted the soccer game at the Deportivo Jimmy Ruiz stadium and forced all of the players to lie face down on the field at around 11:00 p.m. Once they had subjugated everyone on the field, the gunmen executed one of the team's managers, and then went on to kill Arce Rubio (aged 30). After the double-homicide, the gunmen departed. Arce Rubio was reportedly killed by rival members of Los Mazatlecos, a gang headed by Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, nicknamed El Chapo Isidro. Arce Rubio was also reportedly responsible for assassinating two nephews of Amado and Vicente Carrillo Fuentes in Sinaloa. Meza Flores and his gang are reportedly part of the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel, which disputes the drug trafficking corridors with the Sinaloa Cartel in western Mexico. The weekend Arce Rubio was killed, the state of Sinaloa experienced at least 20 homicides possibly linked to the drug lord's death. In one incident, gang members hung three bodies from a bridge in the town of Guam√∫chil. In another incident at a volleyball court in Culiac√°n, unidentified gunmen killed 8 people and injured several others. Several other bullet-ridden corpses were found throughout the state that same weekend. Chino √Åntrax's arrest, death and other events El Chino √Åntrax was arrested by Dutch police on 30 December 2013 at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands at the request of the United States, which contacted Interpol to arrest him for charges relating to drug trafficking. On 20 February 2014, Mexican authorities arrested Jes√∫s Pe√±a (alias \\"El 20\\"), in Culiac√°n following a massive operative carried out to capture \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada. On 23 May 2014, Melesio Beltr√°n Medina (alias \\"El Mele\\") was killed in the Morelos neighborhood in Culiac√°n. Following the arrest of Chino Antrax, some British sources claimed that Claudia Ochoa F√©lix was the new leader of the group. This information was not officially confirmed and she has denied her involvement in organized crime. Ochoa F√©lix was found dead in her private residence in Culiac√°n on the 14th of September 2019, due to apparent pulmonary aspiration caused by a drug overdose. The previous night she had been seen going home with an unidentified man after attending a party in the city centre. The morning after the unidentified man raised an alarm due to F√©lix not responding, she was pronounced dead at the scene. On 3 March 2020, Chino Antrax was released from prison and transferred to house arrest.https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-18/chino-antrax- confirmed-dead On May 9, however, his probation office reported him as missing. https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2020-05-09/one-time- leader-of-sinaloa-cartel-hit-squad-vanishes-from-probation On 15 May 2020, Chino Antrax was found dead in Sinaloa, after being murdered alongside two other people, including his sister.https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/drug-cartel-hitman-el- chino-antrax-killed-mexico-70754962 See also *List of gangs in Mexico References Category:Gangs in Mexico Category:Sinaloa Cartel Category:Mexican drug war Category:Culiac√°n ","title":"Los √Åntrax"},{"id":"37914881","text":"Helmut Adalbert Mahlke (27 August 1913 ‚Äì 26 December 1998) was a highly decorated Oberstleutnant in the Luftwaffe during World War II, and a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, the highest award in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II.

It is located in the city of Troms√∏. It is the church for the Elverh√∏y parish which is part of the Troms√∏ domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H√•logaland. The church was built in its current location in 1974 and it now seats about 435 people. History Elverh√∏y Church Sanctuary This church building was originally built in 1803 on the site of the present Troms√∏ Cathedral. The church, then simply known as Troms√∏ Church served the whole city of Troms√∏. In 1844, the new Diocese of H√•logaland was established and Troms√∏ was to be the seat of the Bishop. A new cathedral was commissioned and in 1861, the new Troms√∏ Cathedral was completed. This new cathedral was on the same site as the Troms√∏ Church, so that church was dismantled and moved a few hundred meters south of the city boundary. It was located outside the city and was then known as the Landkirke (meaning rural church) and later it was renamed the Troms√∏ysund Church. During that time, it was the parish church for the municipality of Troms√∏ysund. After the new Tromsdalen Church was built in 1965 as the new \\"main church\\" for Troms√∏ysund, this church was eventually closed, dismantled, and moved once again. In 1974, this church building was reopened as Elverh√∏y Church, about west of the city centre of Troms√∏ on the island of Troms√∏ya. A full basement was built for its present location, making room for a parish hall, kitchen, cloakroom, and bathroom facilities. It is now somewhat different than its original design. Now, the red, wooden church is a cruciform design constructed with cog jointed timber and the siding is vertical panelling. There is a large steeple over the main entrance now that was not originally present when it was built in 1803.

She won a number of awards, including national awards, and her work is exhibited across the northeast U.S. Introduction Cleo Hartwig belongs to a line of 'direct carvers' (taille direct) which includes both Jose de Creeft, with whom she studied, and Vincent Glinsky, her husband. With this technique the artist carves directly into the materials, without the use of intermediary steps. The conception and execution of the work is influenced by the density, veining, color, texture, and shape of the material. Hartwig belongs to the generation of the 1930s and 1940s who advanced opportunities for women artists. She was an early member of the National Association of Women Artists (eventually serving as Vice President), and the New York Society of Women Artists (eventually serving as Recording Secretary). She is regarded as a member of The New York School,Rubinstein, Charlotte Streifer, American Women Artists, Avon, NY, 1982 and her work was featured in the TV documentary, Women of the First Wave; Elders of the Century.

Her rural upbringing had a lasting influence on the development of her art. She was passionately interested in every detail of plant and animal life‚Äîfrom form to function‚Äîand observed nature with a mix of scientific attention and artistic observation. ‚ÄúGrowing up in rural Michigan before the days of mass media entertainment,‚Äù Hartwig once wrote, ‚Äúthere was ample time to explore the countryside, search for birds‚Äô nests, raise caterpillars until they spun cocoons and hatched into moths or butterflies, find frogs‚Äô eggs in the ponds and watch them develop into tadpoles. These first-hand observations and experiences are among my happiest and sharpest memories, and probably account for the many nature form subjects in my sculpture. There is such rich and endless variety in nature that one could, it seems, design nothing except bird forms and never exhaust the possibilities of interpretation.‚Äù Archive, Estate of Artist Hartwig attended Portland High School between 1921-25, and entered Western State Teachers College (now Western Michigan University) in 1926. She interrupted her studies to teach art at Holland Junior High School (1926-29), and take summer art classes at Chicago Art Institute (1930, 1931). She returned to WSTC to graduate with an A.B. in 1932. After graduation she settled in New York City, finding employment as a teacher at The Town School (1934-36). During the summer of 1935 she studied art in Poland, Hungary, Rumania, and Germany. Hartwig then taught at the Ecole Francaise (1936-39) in New York, and exhibited for the first time in New York at The National Academy of Design (113th Annual, 1938). In 1939 she made a summer trip to France to study art, but returned home hastily because of the growing hostilities. Hartwig took up residence at Patchin Place, the historic Greenwich Village cul-de-sac, home to many famous artists of the early 20th century. (She remained at that address until her death). She joined the faculty of the Lenox School (1939-42), and exhibited her work in group shows at the Clay Club, National Academy of Design, Syracuse University, and Mt. Holyoke College. She was also part of the 1942 ‚ÄúArtists for Victory‚Äù exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. After summer art study in Mexico (1941), Hartwig began to incorporate gestures from that country‚Äôs culture into her work. \\"Her carvings from the 1930s and early 1940s,‚Äù noted Ilene Fort, of the LA County Museum of Art, ‚Äúare characterized by compact, massive forms, crisp outlines, and minimal details. In their blockiness, extreme simplification of shape, and coarse surfaces they especially echo Mesoamerican sculpture.\\"Fort, Ilene Susan, The Figure in American Sculpture; A Question of Modernity University of Washington Press, 1995 During World War II Hartwig did drafting at Bell Telephone Laboratories (1942‚Äì43), and technical illustrating at the Jordanoff Aviation Corp in NY (1943‚Äì45). During this time she held her first solo New York exhibition (Clay Club, 1943), and became active in many arts organizations. She was an early member of the National Association of Women Artists (eventually becoming Vice President), and the New York Society of Women Artists (Recording Secretary). At that time she also began her long association with the Sculptors Guild (Exec. Dir., Exec. Bd., Exec. VP), Audubon Artists (VP for Sculpture, Exhibition Committee), and New York Society of Ceramic Artists (Sculpture Jury). The National Association of Women Artists (NAWA) awarded Hartwig the Anna Hyatt Huntington Prize for her Mandolin Player in 1945. That same year she exhibited with the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, National Academy of Design, National Association of Women Artists, Audubon Artists, and New York Society of Ceramic Artists. She also became a sculpture instructor at Cooper Union in New York and the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey. In addition, she completed an important work for the architect Kenneth B. Norton: a \\"Family Group\\" for the Continental Companies Building on Williams St. in downtown Manhattan. For that commission Hartwig created an 8-foot-high bas- relief of a mother, father, and child, which was cast in aluminum and installed on the front of the building. In 1951 Hartwig married fellow sculptor, Vincent Glinsky (1895-1975). Their son, Albert Glinsky, was born the following year. Throughout the 1950s she continued to teach, complete commissions (S.S. United States), and win prizes (including several from NAWA; Artists Equity; Audubon Artists; Munson Proctor Institute). In addition, Western Michigan University awarded her an Honorary master's degree (1951). During the 1960s Hartwig participated in the annual shows of the Sculptors Guild, exhibited her alabaster ‚ÄúSea Foam‚Äù at the 1964 New York World‚Äôs Fair, and took part in the Bryant Park outdoor exhibits in midtown Manhattan. She worked with reproduction houses (Alva Museum Replicas, Sculpture Collectors, Collectors Guild) and executed a commission for the All-Faiths Memorial Tower in NJ (now George Washington Memorial Park). Her sculptural methods were examined in a feature article in American Artist magazine.Bell, Enid. The Compatibles: Sculptors Hartwig & Glinsky. American Artist, Summer 1968. In the 1970s Hartwig continued to collect honors: she was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Academician (1971) and received an Honorary Doctorate from Western Michigan University (1973). That same decade her work won awards from the National Sculpture Society, Sculptors Guild, National Association of Women Artists, Audubon Artists, and National Academy of Design. She had a solo show at the Montclair Art Museum (1971) and two joint shows with her husband, Vincent Glinsky (Sculpture Center, NY, 1972; Fairfield University, CT, 1974). During the last decade of her life (1980s) Hartwig exhibited in more shows than in any previous decade‚Äî58 in all. Her \\"Owlet,\\" shown at the New York Botanical Garden's Conservatory, was also featured in The New York Times.The New York Times, May 7, 1981, C3. \\"Sculpture to Grace a Garden Is Shown.\\" She was invited to serve on juries around the country, including the 4th North American Sculpture Exhibition, for which she was co-juror with Francisco Z√∫√±iga. She received more awards, gave masterclasses, and continued to sculpt until just months before her death. Cleo Hartwig died on June 18, 1988 in New York City.The New York Times, June 20, 1988.

He worked as the cartel's assassins chief under the tutelage of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada and as the regional leader of the cartel in the states of Baja California and Sonora. His base of operations was in Mexicali, where he coordinated marijuana and cocaine shipments through the Calexico‚ÄìMexicali border region. On 18 December 2013, Inzunza Inzunza was killed in a shootout with Mexican authorities in the resort area of Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora. Before the gunfight was over, several of his gunmen took the corpse of the drug lord with them. Early life Inzunza Inzunza was born in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, Mexico on 17 August 1971. His father Ren√© Inzunza was from La Vuelta, a rural community close to Culiac√°n; like many others who lived in the Sinaloan countryside, his father was involved in the drug trade, but he died when Inzunza Inzunza was still a teenager. Born into a middle-class family, Inzunza Inzunza attended grade and middle school at Colegio Sinaloa, a religious institution. He committed his first homicide when he was 19; one night during a party at his house, he shot a man dead after the man laughed at him. He fled thereafter to the state of Sonora and got involved in drug trafficking and organized crime. Sinaloa Cartel tenure Inzunza Inzunza worked for the drug lord Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada as his assassins' chief, and operated in Culiac√°n and in other regions across Sinaloa. The Mexican authorities believe that he may be responsible for over 80 murders during his tenure in Sinaloa, including the killings of at least a dozen police officers. Throughout his career, Inzunza Inzunza was able to avoid going to prison several times and intimidate law enforcement; one time in the late 1990s, two patrol cars from the Federal Ministerial Police (PFM) went into a neighborhood where Inzunza Inzunza was staying to carry out an arrest warrant. Though the police were going after a person who was not involved with the drug lord, his gunmen stopped the PFM cars and ordered them to call their boss. When the police commander arrived at the scene minutes later, Inzunza Inzunza walked up to him and smacked him several times, telling him he had no permission to be in his territory and to never stop by again. When the drug lord ordered them to leave, his gunmen took away their weapons for a couple of days. On 12 November 2002 in Culiac√°n, the Federal Preventive Police (PFP) intercepted a convoy of gunmen in which Inzunza Inzunza was traveling. A shootout eventually broke out, resulting in the death of four policemen and one gunman. However, Inzunza Inzunza managed to escape the scene. Three years later in April 2005, Inzunza Inzunza intimidated several police officers who were patrolling his neighborhood and forced them to return to their headquarters. On 5 May 2005, Inzunza Inzunza travelled to Mazatl√°n to attend a rehab center for his drug addiction. While heading there, he was arrested by the Mazatl√°n Municipal Police with eight of his men. The police confiscated several assault rifles, handguns, grenades, and grenade launchers. The arrest of Inzunza Inzunza was initially reported by a photojournalist who managed to take a picture of him, but the drug lord never made it to prison; unconfirmed reports stated that he bribed the police to avoid going to jail. He escaped with Ismael Bernal Cristerna (alias \\"El Mongol\\"), an individual who was later killed by Inzunza Inzunza in 2013 because Inzunza Inzunza feared betrayal. Cartel infighting The decline of Inzunza Inzunza's hegemony in the Sinaloa Cartel began in May 2008 when √âdgar Guzm√°n L√≥pez, son of \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, was killed by gunmen in Culiac√°n. During that time, the Sinaloa Cartel was engaged in an internal power struggle with the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel. Alfredo Beltr√°n Leyva was captured by the Mexican Army in January 2008, and his brothers Arturo, Carlos, and H√©ctor had suspicions that Guzm√°n had tipped authorities to Alfredo's whereabouts. In an apparent revenge attack, the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel reportedly killed Guzm√°n's son. However, there are also reports that Inzunza Inzunza might have possibly killed Guzm√°n L√≥pez after confusing him with a member of a rival cartel. This episode complicated Inzunza Inzunza's business relationship with \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, who turned his back on him and refused to give him protection. Around 2010, he was transferred by the top echelons of the Sinaloa Cartel to the states of Baja California and Sonora. His base of operations was in Mexicali, where he coordinated drug trafficking activities. He oversaw Mexicali alongside Cenobio Flores Pacho and/or Luis Fernando Castro Villa (alias \\"El Checo\\"), a Sinaloa Cartel associate. The drug lord also oversaw the areas of San Luis R√≠o Colorado, Puerto Pe√±asco, Nogales, Sonoyta, and Caborca in Sonora. His operational capacity also reached the states of Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Nayarit, Jalisco, and Sinaloa. With the help of his brother, who is identified by Mexican authorities by his alias \\"El Peque\\", Inzunza Inzunza received large quantities of narcotics in Sinaloa from South America. He also had three major smuggling routes across Mexico that he oversaw to move narcotics to the United States. The first route was through a smuggling network that started in Venezuela, crossed through Honduras, Costa Rica, and ended in Sinaloa. The second route started in Chiapas and connected that state with Acapulco, Mexico City, Jalisco, and ended in the U.S. The third and final route started in Sinaloa, crossed through Sonora, Mexicali, Tijuana and ended north of the U.S.-Mexico border. Inzunza Inzunza was known for using violence to exercise control in the territories he oversaw for the Sinaloa Cartel to move marijuana and cocaine through the Calexico‚ÄìMexicali corridor. Aside from coordinating drug trafficking shipments, Inzunza Inzunza was responsible for stopping incursions and fighting off rival drug trafficking organizations in Sonora. In particular, the drug lord commanded his forces against the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel, which was undergoing a gradual resurgence. In early 2011, Inzunza Inzunza fled the area of Mexicali and relocated in Baja California after Manuel Torres F√©lix (alias \\"The Crazy One\\") wanted him dead for the \\"unapproved\\" murder of Paulo Osorio Pay√°n (alias \\"El Pablo\\"), one of his associates. From his safe house in Tijuana, Baja California, the drug lord gave orders in Mexicali. When Torres F√©lix was killed in a gunfight with the Mexican Army in Sinaloa in October 2012, Inzunza Inzunza returned to Mexicali to help his business partner \\"El Checo\\". Inzunza Inzunza's tenure in Mexicali was disrupted in 2012 by a group known as \\"Los Garibay\\", which was controlled by Jos√© Manuel Garibay F√©lix (alias \\"El Manuel√≥n\\" and/or \\"El Gordo\\"), a drug trafficker from the Sinaloa Cartel who joined forces with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) while serving prison time in Jalisco. The infighting resulted in multiple killings in Mexicali and the surrounding areas that year. On 23 February 2013, however, Mexican authorities discovered the corpse of Garibay F√©lix on a highway near Guadalajara, Jalisco. His body bore signs of torture and a bullet hole in the head, usual signs to distinguish common murders from killings committed by organized crime. His death caused the CJNG to break away from its loose connection with the Sinaloa Cartel and operate independently in Jalisco in efforts to fight the Sinaloans for the control of the drug market in the state. Bounty Inzunza Inzunza, also known by his aliases of El Macho Prieto, El MP, El Once, Gonzalo Inzunza Araujo, and/or Bernab√© Le√≥n Andrade, was placed on the most-wanted drug traffickers list under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act by the U.S. government on 1 June 2011, along with Manuel Torres F√©lix, another high-ranking lieutenant of the Sinaloa Cartel. This act prohibited U.S. citizens from doing any kind of business deal with the drug lord and froze its assets. The Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica (PGR) offered up to $3 million Mexican pesos ($USD 230,000) for information leading to their arrests. Inzunza Inzunza was among Mexico's 122 most-wanted criminals, according to the list provided by the PGR database. He had three arrests warrants in Mexico and a provisional detention request with extradition purposes from the U.S. government for pending drug trafficking charges. Death Inzunza Inzunza was killed in a gunfight with Mexican Marines in Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora, on 18 December 2013. The Sonora authorities confirmed that the shootout, which occurred at around 04:00 A.M. that day, left a total of five dead and three vehicles incinerated. Authorities confirmed that two gunmen were killed on the scene during the firefight, while two others died by wrecking their vehicle while attempting to flee the crime scene; the remaining gunman died of gunshot wound complications. Preliminary reports stated that gunmen held several hostages at a hotel during the raging gunfire, but the Sonora authorities denied the authenticity of these initial reports. The shootout was reported to have lasted at least four hours. An eye- witness close to the crime scene said to the press that a police helicopter was involved in the fire exchange from mid-air with the gunmen, who fired at the chopper from the ground. According to initial reports, the incident began when the Mexican authorities chased a white Chevrolet pick-up truck in Sonoyta, Sonora following a reported homicide; the police later caught up to the vehicle in Puerto Pe√±asco after the men in the vehicle opened fire on them. Other reports issued a few days after the shooting stated that Mexican authorities raided the property where the drug lord was staying after they had tracked down his location. Following the shootout, the local authorities ordered the school district of Puerto Pe√±asco to suspend classes for the day. The U.S. Consulate in Nogales, Sonora, issued a travel warning through Twitter advising U.S. tourists to stay indoors until the gunfire was over. Puerto Pe√±asco (known in English as \\"Rocky Point\\") is Sonora's major tourist attraction and a common hotspot for U.S. citizens given its 50 mi (80.4 km) proximity from the U.S.-Mexico border. Investigation and aftermath On 19 December 2013, Mexican authorities confirmed in a press conference that the corpse of Inzunza Inzunza was stolen by alleged gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel during the shootout. Investigators, however, identified the drug lord due to the DNA tests conducted at the crime scene. Authorities were also able to intercept the phone call lines of the criminals involved in the shootout and confirm that the drug lord was killed. The Pe√±asco city spokesman confirmed a couple of days later that the shootout begun precisely inside the Bella Sirena complex, a beachfront villa where Inzunza Inzunza was possibly staying for the holidays. He insisted that neither the drug lord nor any of his men involved in the shootout lived in Pe√±asco. Mexican authorities also provided more details of the shootout in the days following the gunfight; they confirmed that two Black Hawk helicopters were used in the operation, and that there were at least 10 vehicles of the alleged gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel present during the fire exchange. The police confirmed that they found 14 high-calibre assault rifles at the scene. They also confirmed that five criminals were killed in the shootout (not six, as stated by other sources) and two officers were wounded. The authorities also confirmed that they had an undercover federal agent staying at the complex where Inzunza Inzunza was hiding for about 15 days prior to the shooting. By spying on him throughout the day and passing that information to his counterparts, authorities were able to use those intelligence reports to hunt down the drug lord. Investigators believe that some of the top leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel might have tipped off the authorities as to Inzunza Inzunza's whereabouts. This line of investigation alleges that during his time in the cartel, Inzunza Inzunza killed \\"people of his same company\\" and then denied culpability. Therefore, investigators believe that given the drug lord's disobedience in the eyes of his leaders, the cartel gave the order to execute him in the first days of December 2013. The leaders reportedly decided to oust Inzunza Inzunza by betraying his whereabouts to the Mexican government in a plan to get him arrested or killed.

She hosted Breaking the Set on the Russian network RT America from 2012 to 2015. In 2015, Martin launched the investigative documentary and interview series The Empire Files, originally hosted by Telesur.  Early life  Born in Oakland, California, Martin was raised in Pleasanton, where she attended local public schools. She graduated from Amador Valley High School in 2002. After high school, Martin began painting and photography; some of her works were exhibited around California. She became interested in journalism when her old high school boyfriend enlisted in the military after the September 11 attacks in 2001. \\"I didn't want him going to war, let alone fighting in one... I began to critically ask 'What is really going on? By the time she was a sophomore at San Diego State University, Martin began to look into what she called the \\"selling\\" of the Iraq War by the media. She received an undergraduate degree in political science and minored in Spanish. Martin canvassed for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and participated in the Occupy movement, but eventually became disillusioned with the Democratic Party. (Event occurs from 1:58‚Äî3:26.) She worked for a San Diego-based online news site until moving back to Northern California.  Career   9/11 conspiracy theories  In 2008, Martin was part of the 9/11 Truth movement, starting her own 9/11 Truther group in San Diego. In a 2008 video of a 9/11 truth movement demonstration, she said: \\"I‚Äôve researched it for three years and every single thing that I uncover solidifies my belief that it was an inside job and that our government was complicit in what happened.\\" Shortly after beginning her show on RT, Martin stated in an interview with Mark Crispin Miller that \\"the media dismisses things that are too controversial as conspiracy theory\\". In March 2014, Martin told the Associated Press that she \\"no longer subscribes\\" to the theory that 9/11 was an inside job, as she had earlier. Breaking the Set and work for RT  From 2012 to 2015, Martin hosted her own show, Breaking the Set, on RT America. Bidder's article also appeared in other news outlets, such as The program described itself as \\"a show that cuts through the false left/right paradigm set by the establishment and reports the hard facts\\".Breaking the Set: About. YouTube Channel. Retrieved January 16, 2014. The original opening credits depict Martin applying a sledgehammer to a television tuned to CNN. Martin's show promoted conspiracy theories including the claim that water fluoridation was a government plot to poison unwary Americans. On RT in February 2013, she commented that Israel uses \\"Hitler's methods\\" to sustain a \\"Jewish majority\\". In 2014, Martin gained attention for her criticism of RT's coverage of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Martin closed her show on March 3, 2014 with a minute-long statement condemning the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Glenn Greenwald compared Martin's statement favorably to the unquestioning behavior of the United States media during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Critics of Martin argue that she appeared to be reading from a teleprompter, implying that her remarks were made with the consent of the show's producers. RT issued a statement saying: \\"Contrary to the popular opinion, RT doesn't beat its journalists into submission, and they are free to express their own opinions, not just in private but on the air.\\". RT added: \\"[W]e'll be sending her to Crimea to give her an opportunity to make up her own mind from the epicentre of the story.\\" Martin declined the offer, saying \\"I am not going to Crimea despite the statement RT has made.\\" The New York Times wrote that RT notified Martin that what she had said about Ukraine was \\"not in line with our editorial policy\\". Martin left RT in February 2015. Speaking for RT, Anna Belkina told BuzzFeed: \\"Abby decided that this is the time for her to try something new. We are proud of the great work she has done as the host of Breaking the Set.\\" James Kirchick commented that \\"Thanks to her paymasters in the Kremlin, she had three years to use the network‚Äôs airwaves and wildly popular YouTube channel to broadcast paranoid diatribes that would otherwise have languished in anonymity on the Internet fringe.\\" Martin called the charges of foreign control over her and Tulsi Gabbard \\"neoMcCarthyist hysteria\\" typical of the New Cold War. She said that the \\"campaign to malign RT\\" by \\"the corporate media\\" had resulted in a chilling effect over legitimate dissident reporters. She said that she had \\"complete editorial control\\" over her RT show, as did other American RT journalists like Chris Hedges and Lee Camp. She had earlier refused RT's offer to send her on a tour of Crimea, saying she didn't want a \\"vetted PR experience.\\" In January 2017, an Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) report released following Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election described Breaking the Set as being overwhelmingly focused on criticism of the United States and Western governments, stating that it had been promoting \\"radical discontent\\".  The Empire Files  Abby Martin interviewing a member of the Green Cross during the 2017 Venezuelan protests In September 2015, Martin launched The Empire Files, an interview and documentary series. She has hosted guests such as Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky, Richard D. Wolff, Ralph Nader and Jill Stein. The show was originally hosted by Telesur English, a media outlet sponsored primarily by the government of Venezuela. Martin told Ben Norton writing for AlterNet: \\"The show is totally independent of Telesur. We merely sell them the content; they have zero control over anything we do\\". In 2018, Telesur stopped funding The Empire Files due to increasing US sanctions on Venezuela, according to a press release published by Martin's Media Roots website. In August 2018 the show moved to a donation model in order to continue production. The show has since become exclusively a web series, with episodes being uploaded to her website, YouTube and Vimeo. In May 2019, Martin released her feature film documentary, The Empire Files: Gaza Fights for Freedom, about the Gaza‚ÄìIsrael conflict. The documentary was shown across the US, UK and Australia at independent theatreshttps://mediaroots.org/gaza- fights-for-freedom-uscanada-screening-tour-with-abby-martin/  Free speech lawsuit  In February 2020, Martin's booking to speak at a conference at Georgia Southern University on Critical Media Literacy was cancelled when she refused to sign a pledge not to boycott Israel as required by law in the State of Georgia. Martin, represented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, filed a free-speech lawsuit against the State of Georgia. The conference was later cancelled.  Reception  Millennial Magazine said that Martin was an \\"unfiltered\\" media representative for the Millennial generation who reports \\"stories that deserve public recognition\\".Hysen, Britt (July 28, 2014). RT Host Abby Martin Takes On Corporate Media. Millennial Magazine. Retrieved July 28, 2014. Journalist Michael C. Moynihan states that \\"Martin‚Äôs politics are odious and frequently incoherent\\" for claiming to lament \\"lost American freedom\\" while ignoring the multiple brutalities of the Russian government before its invasion of Crimea and her defence of Hugo Ch√°vez against the charge of tyranny. Martin has been criticized for her past support of the 9/11 truth movement. In 2014 New York Times columnist Robert Mackey contrasted Martin's critical remarks on the occupation of Crimea with her conviction \\"that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were part of a government conspiracy.\\" Author and media consultant Chez Pazienza criticized Martin for being a 9/11 Truther. David Cromwell, British media campaigner of and co-editor of Media Lens, states that Martin is a \\"superb independent journalist ... who has risked her life to report what the corporate media is not telling you about Venezuela\\". Regarding her work on Venezuela, libertarian journalist and author John Stossel states that Martin \\"does government-funded propaganda for Telesur\\".  Personal life  Martin and Empire Files co-producer Mike Prysner became engaged in August 2018 and later married. Martin gave birth to their first child on May 31, 2020.

Regular season After the second worst season in Doug Mills tenure as the head coach of the Fighting Illini, the ongoing war created even more havoc with the 1944-45 season. The Illini were required to play games close to home which meant they played certain teams multiple times. For example, the team played Great Lakes three times, Chanute Field, in nearby Rantoul, Illinois, two times and George Mikan and the DePaul Blue Demons two times as well. As the season progressed, Mills experimented with several lineups, including a 19 player barrage versus Nebraska. These varied lineups allowed Mills to play an impressive freshman, Johnny Orr, playing his only season for Illinois prior to rejoining his high school coach, Dolph Stanley, at Beloit College in Beloit, Wisconsin. The Big Ten Conference season was unusual as well. The Illini dropped their opening game to Michigan followed by a seven-game winning streak then concluding with four consecutive losses. The heaviest load fell on the hands of sophomores Walt Kirk and Howard Judson with freshman Walt Kersulis, Jack Burmaster, and Orr also being major contributors. Kirk would be named a Consensus All-American for his performance during the season. The team completed their season with an overall record of 13 wins and 7 losses with a conference mark of 7 and 5 for a third-place finish. They finished with a 7 - 3 record at home and a road record of 5 - 4. The starting lineup consisted of Walton Kirk, Howard Judson, Johnny Orr, Jack Burmaster, Don Delaney and Walt Kersulis.

Canada's Health Care System.Archives Canada. Royal Commission on Health Services fonds. Originally implemented on July 1, 1958, with five participating provinces, by January 1, 1961, all ten provinces were enlisted. The federal funding was coupled with terms and conditions borrowed from the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan, introduced in 1947 as the first universal hospital insurance program in North America. In order to receive funding, services had to be universal, comprehensive, accessible and portable. This stipulation was dropped in 1977 with the Established Programs Financing Act and then reinstated in 1984 in the Canada Health Act. Widely acknowledged as the foundation for future developments in the Canadian health care system, the HIDS Act was a landmark example of federal-provincial cooperation in post-war Canada.Taylor, Malcolm G. (1978). Health Insurance and Canadian Public Policy, McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal. Background Prior to World War II, health care in Canada was privately funded and delivered, with the exception of services provided to the sick poor that were financed by local governments. The experience of the 1930s left many Canadians in challenging financial situations. As personal financial situations deteriorated, the municipal governments were overwhelmed. Though the provinces provided relief payments for food, clothing, and shelter, additional medical costs were beyond the capacity of most of the provincial budgets. Many Canadians were not receiving adequate medical care, and those that did were overwhelmed with the associated costs. As such, preventable diseases and deaths were still common occurrences. Ten years of depression, followed by six years of war, formed the social context of the ambitious federal Green Book proposals. In a bid for unprecedented cooperation between the federal and provincial governments, these initiatives formed the foundations of a national program for social security, including provisions for health insurance. However, the failure to come to a consensus on the required allocation of tax resources at the Dominion-Provincial Conference in August 1945 precluded adoption and delayed subsequent action. Although the Green Book proposals were not adopted, they effectively created an appetite for government-funded health services.Canadian Museum of Civilization (2010). Making Medicare: The history of health care in Canada, 1914‚Äì2007. Cooperative Commonwealth Federation Party banner Despite a lack of commitment for federal funding, Saskatchewan proceeded with a plan for provincial hospital insurance. From the collective efforts of the \\"wheat economy\\" came a cooperative movement towards efficient agencies to deliver services to Saskatchewan‚Äôs sparse population. Strong local engagement contributed to the creation of the union hospital system and municipal hospital care plans. However, a solution to the problem of providing medical and hospital services to a population reeling from the devastating effects of the depression required a greater provincial contribution. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation won their first majority government in 1944. Continuing the Liberal health insurance platform that introduced \\"A Bill Respecting Health Insurance,\\" Tommy Douglas, as the new premier, signalled his commitment to the provision of health services by assuming the role of Health Minister as well. By 1947, Saskatchewan introduced the first universal hospital insurance program in North America. Saskatchewan's decision to launch the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan accelerated and influenced the development of other provincial insurance plans. The British Columbia Hospital Insurance Service was passed in early 1948 and followed soon after by the Alberta insurance system. The success of these provincial plans combined with the volume of illness and associated costs, in addition to provincial disparities in health coverage, fuelled debate on the topic of a federally funded health service. There was much disagreement as to the appropriate scope, funding allocation, and administration of such a plan. After several years of debate between the stakeholders, including Canadian medical professional associations and the provincial governments, the federal government made an offer to fund approximately one half of the national cost of diagnostic services and in-patient hospital care for provinces that implemented insurance plans. Five provinces, namely British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Newfoundland, accepted the proposal, laying the groundwork for a Canadian health insurance plan. Overview On May 1, 1957, the HIDS Act was formally legislated in Canada in response to the increasing pressures for national comprehensive health insurance. Under the Act, the federal government agreed to fund approximately 50% of the costs of provincial or territorial insurance plans for hospital and diagnostic services.Turner, J. Gilbert (1958). The Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act: Its impact on hospital administration, Canadian Medical Association Journal, 78(10), 768-770. Formally, federal funding comprised 25% of the per capita costs for hospital services in Canada plus 25% of the per capita costs for hospital services in the province or territory multiplied by the number of insured persons in that jurisdiction. Funding was made available to any province or territory that agreed to make insured hospital services available to the region under uniform provisions.Manga, Pran, Broyles Robert W., & Angus, Douglas E. (1987). The determinants of hospital utilization under a universal public insurance program in Canada, Medical Care, 25(7), 658-670. Provisions Participating provinces and territories were obligated to satisfy four funding conditions as follows: *Comprehensiveness: All- encompassing in-patient and out-patient hospital services as well as diagnostic services were to be made available under the insurance plan. *Universality: Services were to be made available to all residents of the province or territory. *Accessibility: Services were to be made reasonably accessible to insured persons in a manner that did not preclude or impede access either directly or indirectly. *Portability: Provincial plans were to provide coverage for out-of-province Canadian residents who were insured by home provincial or territorial plans. Provinces and Territories were also obligated to limit co-payments and other \\"deterrent\\" fees to ensure that patients were not placed under financial burden at the point of care. Though there was no other explicit provision preventing provinces and territories from demanding financial contribution for services from patients, such charges would have reduced the federal contribution since, under the cost-sharing arrangement, federal funding was proportional to provincial and territorial contributions.Parliament of Canada. The health of Canadians ‚Äì The federal role. Retrieved December 7, 2012. Therefore, the Act intrinsically deterred provinces and territories from charging patients for services. Coverage Provincial and territorial insurance plans were to cover acute, convalescent, and chronic care of patients, including diagnostic services and in-patient drug administration in hospital facilities. However, coverage was not provided for hospitals for tuberculosis, mental hospitals, nursing homes, capital expenditures, or administrative costs. Funding Each province and territory was to be responsible for administering its own plan; therefore, each had the right to decide how to raise its proportion of funding for the insurance program, either through insurance premiums or taxation. Delivery Under the Act, insured services could only be delivered by hospitals, most of which were private entities. Hospital employees including physicians, laboratory technicians, and radiologists were to be paid via a fee-for-service model negotiated with the provincial or territorial administrative body. The passage of the HIDS Act was the first milestone in the evolution of national health insurance in Canada and provided the foundation for all future Canadian Health legislation. Outcomes By 1961, almost all Canadians were entitled to comprehensive hospital care benefits, protecting them from large hospital bills. The HIDS act enabled hospital operations that were not previously feasible and facilitated access to care for who could not otherwise afford it. Lester B. Pearson The HIDS Act laid the foundation for other notable developments in the Canadian health care system. One of the criticisms of the Act was that it did not cover medical services, which in 1955 comprised approximately 40% of national healthcare costs. Following the adoption of the HIDS Act, then, extending health insurance to cover additional medical services was next on the federal agenda. At the Federal-Provincial Conference in July, 1965, the decision for Medicare was made. Then, on July 1, 1967, the governing Liberals under Lester B. Pearson introduced the Medical Care Act, covering 50% of physician costs outside of a hospital. Together, the HIDS Act and Medical Care Act brought hospital and physician services to all Canadians, regardless of their ability to pay. Though criticized for imposing federal priorities on provincial jurisdiction, provincial governments were left with no option other than to meet the federal provisions or forgo supplementary funding altogether. To address these concerns, the Established Programs Financing Act was passed in 1977, transferring the responsibility of the program to the provinces by decoupling the amount of the federal transfer from the provisions. Some provinces levied user charges and authorized extra-billing, which threatened universal and free access to healthcare.Madore, Odette (2005).The Canada Health Act: Overview and options. The federal government, then, enacted the Canada Health Act in 1984 to re-instate the provisions of the HIDS Act and also the Medical Care Act.

Uncharacteristically for the band, the album's title comes from an album track, as the second track shares a title with the album. The album was released on March 5, 2013 on Idlewild Recordings -- the band's independent imprint -- with Megaforce Records in the US. The album was also separately released on March 8 in Australia through Breakaway Records and on March 11 in Europe, through Lojinx. One week before its physical release, Nanobots was released digitally for streaming in its entirety through the band's SoundCloud, announced by Rolling Stone. Prior to this, \\"Call You Mom\\", \\"Black Ops\\" and \\"Lost My Mind\\" were released through the advance digital Nanobots EP in January 2013. The EP, released through Amazon.com and iTunes, was met with fairly positive responses. Production The album, which contains 25 tracks and runs approximately 45 minutes, was recorded in Manhattan and produced by Patrick Dillett. The relatively short run time is accounted for by the fact that the album includes many of what band member John Flansburgh describes as \\"extremely short songs\\". Flansburgh adds that \\"...the songs kind of stand alone. When you listen to the album alone, it has this manic pacing to it with the short songs. It makes for a different kind of listening experience.\\" John Linnell commented that these songs were naturally written as short songs to avoid over-populating them with unnecessary verses and choruses. This distinguishes them from the \\"Fingertips\\" suite of songs under one minute long on Apollo 18, as those songs were written specifically with brevity in mind, and were described by Linnell as having been \\"hyper- arranged\\". Artwork Artwork for Nanobots was designed by Paul Sahre, using collages by artist Sam Weber. Throughout the album artwork, four of Weber's collages are used: Ingres, Hansel, Jester(clown), and Blue Beard 2. The same style was used for the promotional Nanobots EP. The collages were described by Christopher R. Weingarten for Spin as \\"Max-Ernst-gone-Saw\\".  Promotion  Before the release of the full album, two tracks from the album were released digitally. \\"Call You Mom\\" and \\"You're on Fire\\" were made available through Rolling Stone and Stereogum, respectively, in the winter preceding the album's release. A full week before the album's official release date, the entire album was also uploaded to TMBG's SoundCloud. Further emphasizing the availability of free music via the Internet, the band also released a mobile app for iOS and Android devices. The app, which is updated daily, allows the user to stream five They Might Be Giants tracks at a time. They Might Be Giants played an international tour in support of Nanobots. The tour included shows in North America and Australia. The band also performed in the United Kingdom and Germany during the tour.  Reception  Nanobots has garnered generally positive reviews from critics. It has received an aggregate score of 69 (based on 8 reviews) on Metacritic. Both Heather Phares, writing for Allmusic, and Steven Arroyo for Consequence of Sound indicated approval of the album's selection of tracks that run under a minute long. Reviewers also found Nanobots to be similar to some of the band's earlier material. In particular, the album was compared to Apollo 18, which featured \\"Fingertips\\", a series of 21 songs, almost all under 30 seconds long. Longtime music critic Robert Christgau described \\"Tesla\\" as \\"strong as‚Äë-and more soulful than‚Äë-anything in their catalogue\\", and also cited \\"Black Ops\\" and \\"Replicant\\" as highlights. The album debuted at #57 on the Billboard 200. The album also spent a few weeks on the CMJ Radio 200 chart, peaking at #13 in April.

ACS Techs perform multiple aircraft maintenance activities on and off the aircraft, such as sheet metal repair and fabrication, aircraft refinishing, industrial sewing, machining, and composite work. ACS techs can further their skills by applying for Occupational Specialty Qualification courses (OSQ), which can include Quality Assurance Special Metals Welding, advanced composite repair, Helicopter Rotor Blade Repair, and special purpose machining. ACS techs may also be employed to conduct Elementary Aircraft Servicing tasks such as aircraft towing, aircraft starts, aircraft jacking, before flight check (B-Check), after flight checks (A-Check), as well as replenishing aircraft systems including fuels, lubricants, hydraulics, and all aircraft technical administration (paperwork). Eligibility and educational objectives ACS techs must have successfully passed the 13-week Basic Military Qualification (BMQ) course at the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. After graduating from BMQ, potential ACS techs will then conduct a 4-week Developmental Phase 2 (DP2) \\"Common Core\\" Course at the Canadian Forces School of Aerospace Technology and Engineering (CFSATE) as well as a 4-week \\"Basic Electrical Training\\" (BET) course. Upon completion of the aforementioned courses, potential Aircraft Structures (ACS) Technicians will attend a 65-week-long course at CFSATE located at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Borden, Ontario. This course covers everything they will need to perform their job once they are assigned to a Unit. The course is designed to provide the technician with the basic skill set required to perform elementary tasks. Some of the topics covered are; user maintenance on tools and equipment, aircraft servicing duties, corrosion control, protective coatings and markings, textiles, machining, welding, aircraft structural repairs, and composites and plastics. Maintenance authorizations Upon completion of the ACS course, ACS techs will be posted to a Royal Canadian Air Force Unit and begin their apprenticeship. The apprenticeship will last between 18 and 24 months, where they will have to complete their Apprenticeship Log Book. The Log Book consists of 22 task areas with numerous sub tasks that must be completed before they achieve Performance of Maintenance (POM). Due to the inexperience of all new apprentices, ACS apprentices must be supervised by a qualified peer or supervisor while they are conducting aircraft maintenance repairs. Performance of Maintenance (POM) is the ability to be able to work by yourself and \\"sign\\" for your work, however, all POM work projects must be inspected and the paperwork can then be closed by the qualified technician. POM's are also the working force of the trade. After 4 years of working on aircraft, showing confidence, and the ability to perform aircraft maintenance properly, POM's can be recommended for Level \\"A\\" authorization. \\"A\\" Level is the authorization that allows a POM to sign for work and apprentices work. Level \\"A\\" Signatories typically tend to do more paperwork than hands on work as they are required to inspect all POM paperwork. The Level \\"A\\" signature certifies that the POM conducted a safe repair and that the associated paperwork is filled out completely and properly. As the Level \\"A\\" personnel are the only ones who can be granted the assessors authorization, they are also the teaching force for ACS Apprentices. Assessors are the only personnel who can sign off apprentice sub tasks as well as task areas, thus assessing their development as a technician. A CFSATE Student Applying Aircraft Stencils Working environment ACS techs typically work in shops and on hangar floors, but can also find themselves on ships, in the field, or on deployment to the Arctic or throughout the World. Repairs for some Aircraft Structures can be difficult to access, so aircraft stands, awkward positions, or confined space entry may be required. ACS techs are required to lift and move heavy stock, materials, parts and equipment, and are regularly required to work long hours in a standing position, sometimes wearing full chemical suits with boots, gloves, and respirator, inside a heated paint booth. Tail sections students of CFSATE practice their skills on Occupational Hazards ACS techs regularly come in contact with hazardous chemicals and materials, which include: Polyurethane paints, Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), Zinc chromate paint primers, oils, jet fuel, paint strippers, and paint thinners. ACS techs are also exposed to noise, fumes, dust, odors, carcinogenic materials, and UV (welding) flashes. ACS techs use personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of injury, but additional medical tests are used to monitor a technicians health above what is standard for most other Canadian Forces trades. An ACS Tech in an ACS Machine Shop Conclusion ACS technicians are a vital part of the Royal Canadian Air Force Aircraft Maintenance platform. They are always having to adapt their skills with the advancements in the Aerospace Industries. ACS techs are currently in the process of taking over the Aircraft Life Support Equipment (ALSE) from the Aviation Technician Trade in an attempt to be more deployable. By doing this the trade is almost doubling its numbers from 460 to 860 technicians Forces wide.

The diameter of an object measured with a caliper is sometimes called the caliper diameter; it is the same as Feret diameter. Feret diameter applied to a projection of a 3D object. The Feret diameter or Feret's diameter is a measure of an object size along a specified direction. In general, it can be defined as the distance between the two parallel planes restricting the object perpendicular to that direction. It is therefore also called the caliper diameter, referring to the measurement of the object size with a caliper. This measure is used in the analysis of particle sizes, for example in microscopy, where it is applied to projections of a three- dimensional (3D) object on a 2D plane. In such cases, the Feret diameter is defined as the distance between two parallel tangential lines rather than planes. Mathematical properties From Cauchy's theorem it follows that for a 2D convex body, the Feret diameter averaged over all directions („ÄàF„Äâ) is equal to the ratio of the object perimeter (P) and pi, i.e.,„ÄàF„Äâ= P/. There is no such relation between„ÄàF„Äâand P for a concave object. Applications Feret diameter is used in the analysis of particle size and its distribution, e.g. in a powder or a polycrystalline solid; Alternative measures include Martin diameter, Krumbein diameter and Heywood diameter. The term first became common in scientific literature in the 1970s and can be traced to L.R. Feret (after whom the diameter is named) in the 1930s It is also used in biology as a method to analyze the size of cells in tissue sections.

Facts Dame Joan Young (n√©e Joan Wadham, sister and a co-heiress of her brother Nicholas Wadham) and Thomas Saunger received a writ from the Exchequer, directing the Sheriff of Dorset to round up 400 loose swans from the rivers of the county. Swans were Royal fowl, however, and a wild swan was considered the property of the monarch.Sir Edward Coke, The reports of Sir Edward Coke in thirteen parts.J. Butterworth and Son, 1826 page 83Joseph Chitty, A treatise on the game laws and on fisheries. W Clarke 1812 page 834 The right to these swans in Dorset had since time immemorial been held by the local abbot, who lost the right along with the abbey to Henry VIII at the dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry then granted the estate to Giles Strangways, Dame Joan's deceased first husband, whose heir gave them a right to the swans for one year. The new Queen, Elizabeth I, now sought possession of the swans. Judgment The question was whether the swans were Strangways's to grant or remained the Queen's. Sir Edward Coke, as Solicitor General, represented the Queen. The Court held that the swans that are ferae naturae, or wild animals, cannot be given by transfer or taken by prescription.

The 266th was formed three times during the war. It was first formed in July 1941 from an NKVD division and destroyed during the later stages of the Battle of Smolensk in August. It was reformed in December and destroyed in the Second Battle of Kharkov in May 1942. The 266th was formed for a third time in August 1942, and fought in Operation Little Saturn, the Donbass Strategic Offensive, the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin. Postwar, the division briefly remained in Germany before being withdrawn to Stalingrad, where it became a separate rifle brigade. In 1953 it was expanded into the 68th Mechanized Division, and in 1957 it became the 117th Motor Rifle Division. In 1965 it was renumbered the 266th Motor Rifle Division, and a year later transferred to the Soviet Far East. The division was based in Amur Oblast until it was reduced to a storage base in 1989.  History   First formation  The 266th was first formed between 26 June and 2 July 1941 at Kaluga in the Moscow Military District as the 26th NKVD Mountain Division. It had a cadre of 1500 NKVD officers and men, and was to complete its formation as an NKVD unit by 17 July. By 2 July, it was transferred to the Red Army as the 266th Rifle Division, and consisted of the 1006th, 1008th, and 1010th Rifle Regiments, the 832nd Artillery Regiment, 557th Sapper Battalion, 379th Reconnaissance Company, and the 451st Truck Company. In early August, the 266th joined the 21st Army of the Bryansk Front. It attempted to hold the southern flank of the front and counterattack against Heinz Guderian's 2nd Panzer Group and the German 2nd Army south of Smolensk. In late August, the 2nd Panzer Group advanced south across the Desna River, breaking through the 21st Army. At this time the division was part of the army's 66th Rifle Corps and suffered heavy losses. It was disbanded on 30 August, but some of its units continued to fight under the army, and the division was still reporting its status to the army command as late as 14 September.  Second formation  The 467th Rifle Division started forming in the Stalingrad Military District on 14 December 1941. On 22 December the division was redesignated as the 266th Rifle Division at Kuybyshev in the Volga Military District. It included the 1006th, 1008th, and 1010th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 832nd Artillery Regiment, 360th Anti-Tank Battalion, 575th Sapper Battalion, 369th Reconnaissance Company, the 81st Anti-Aircraft Battery, 215th Communications Company, 295th Medical Battalion, and 451st Truck Company. After it was redesignated, the division was moved a short distance west to the Volga River area near Stalingrad. It remained there, forming and training under the Stalingrad Military District, until April 1942, when it was assigned to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK). In late April, the 266th joined the Southwestern Front's 6th Army. On 12 May, when the Kharkov offensive in the Second Battle of Kharkov began, the 266th was an assault unit and had the most success in its initial attacks. As a result, it was farther into the pocket when the German counterattack surrounded the army in the Izyum Pocket in late May. The division never made it out and the pocket was mopped up between 26 and 28 May. The 266th was officially disbanded on 30 May. Its former commander, Alexander Tavantsev, was captured and became an officer in the Russian Liberation Army.  Third formation  A map showing the battles of the division's third formation (not to scale) The 266th was reformed for a third time on 26 August 1942 in Kuybyshev Oblast, part of the Volga Military District. It included the same basic order of battle as the previous formation. The division included 10,373 men, including cadres from the Barnaul and Saratov Infantry Schools, men from other Volga Military District units, convalescent wounded, and 780 non- commissioned officers and veterans transferred from the Far Eastern Front. It was commanded by Major General Leonid Vetoshnikov, a veteran of World War I and the Russian Civil War, who previously had been chief of the operations department of the Southwestern Front. The 266th remained in the district until October, when it was assigned to the 4th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On 10 November, the division went to the front with the army, which became the 2nd Guards Army and was assigned to the Southwestern Front. Just before it fought in Operation Little Saturn in December, the division included 10,163 officers and men, who were equipped with 7,229 rifles, 931 submachine guns, 250 light machine guns, 81 heavy machine guns, 188 mortars, 30 45mm anti-tank guns, and 44 76mm cannon or howitzers. The 832nd Artillery Regiment was formed without its authorized 122mm howitzers, and as a result was completely equipped with 76mm guns, like other divisions formed in mid-1942. Around this time the division transferred to the 3rd Guards Army's 14th Guards Rifle Corps. In late February 1943, the division was with the 5th Tank Army. By the end of March 1943, it was back with the 3rd Guards Army. After April, the 266th was part of the 32nd Rifle Corps. On 5 September, the division fought in the recapture of Artemovsk during the Donbass Strategic Offensive, and it was later awarded the honorific \\"Artemovsk\\". In late October, the army became part of the 4th Ukrainian Front. On 13 February 1944, the division was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class. In late February, it was transferred to the 3rd Ukrainian Front's 6th Army with the 32nd Rifle Corps. The 266th became part of the 46th Army in March and transferred to front reserves in May. In June, it joined the 5th Shock Army. It fought in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive with the army and moved into the RVGK with the army in September. While in reserve, the 215th Communications Company was expanded into the 728th Communications Battalion and the 360th Anti-Tank Battalion was reequipped with SU-76 self-propelled guns and became the 360th Self-Propelled Battalion. By 1 October, the division had a total of 80 guns and howitzers of all types, 72 82mm and 120 mm mortars, 12 SU-76s, 141 Anti-Tank rifles, and 374 machine guns. In late October, the division transferred with the 26th Guards Rifle Corps to the 1st Belorussian Front, where it fought for the rest of the war. In January 1945, during the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, the division loaded 30 men into each of its 18 US 2.5 ton trucks, added enough ‚Äúcollected vehicle‚Äù to motorize most of the 1006th Rifle Regiment heavy weapons, and used this improvised motor rifle force to support tank units pursuing retreating German troops across Poland. By this time most of the division artillery had been motorized with half-tracks, including both Lend-Lease US M3A1s and captured German vehicles. The division fought in the Battle of Berlin from April 1945. In the battle, it was with the 5th Shock Army's 26th Guards Rifle Corps, part of the 1st Belorussian Front. During the fighting in the Oderbruch and the Battle of the Seelow Heights in mid-April, the division was hit by friendly fire from its own artillery as it reached the tree line. The division ended the war with the honorifics \\"Artemovsk‚ÄìBerlin Red Banner Order of Suvorov\\".  Postwar  The division remained with the 5th Shock Army's 26th Guards Rifle Corps in eastern Germany. By the northern hemisphere summer of 1946, it was withdrawn to Stalingrad in the North Caucasus Military District, where it became part of the 29th Rifle Corps and was downsized into the 18th Separate Rifle Brigade. The brigade was soon transferred to the 6th Rifle Corps. Between 1949 and 1953, the corps was part of the Don Military District. In October 1953, it was expanded into the 68th Mechanized Division, part of the 6th Rifle Corps. On 4 June 1957, the division was converted into the 117th Motor Rifle Division with the 6th Army Corps (the former 6th Rifle Corps). On 19 February 1965, it was renumbered as the 266th Motor Rifle Division, restoring its original World War II designation. In September 1966, the 266th Motor Rifle Division was transferred from Volgograd to Raychikhinsk in Amur Oblast, and was replaced by the 82nd Motor Rifle Division at Volgograd. The division became part of the 35th Army at Raychikhinsk in 1969. In the late 1980s, the division headquarters, the 430th Motor Rifle Regiment, and the 832nd Artillery Regiment were at Raychikhinsk, the 155th Motor Rifle Regiment at Obluchye, the 785th Motor Rifle Regiment at Arkhara, and the 376th Tank Regiment at Zelvino. On 25 October 1989, it was converted into the 5508th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base.

It is a slow-growing tree and grows best in loose, unconsolidated soils. It is adapted to survive flooding at a minimal level, but can sometimes last in deeper floods.Theobroma bicolor (Macambo) at www.rainforestconservation.org. In the central Amazon region, the tree produces fruit from March to November, and flowers from July to September. Similar to its close relative, the cacao tree, the mocambo tree's seeds are edible, high in calories, and rich in protein and fiber. The seeds are also high in Omega 9 and contain caffeine. Cultivation and use T. grandiflorum, T. bicolor, T. speciosum, and T. cacao, photo by Roy Bateman Theobroma bicolor was historically cultivated by the Aztecs alongside T. cacao for production of chocolate, although when chocolate was introduced to the Spaniards, they considered the product of T. bicolor to be of a lower quality.Pataxte and cacao in Mayan ethnobotany, iconography, and art history by Nicholas M. Hellmuth, at www.maya-archaeology.org. Its seeds can also be eaten fried or in soups, and the seed pods when emptied are used as planters and containers. The pulp which surrounds the seeds can be eaten fresh, and has a sweet, mild taste. When the fruit is ripe, it naturally detaches from the tree branches and falls to the ground; the general method of harvesting is collecting the fallen fruit. Mayas placed a high value on the buttery foam crowning beverages of cacao and maize, according to descriptions from the time of the Conquista, and it appears that a thick, stable foam can be produced using fruits of T. bicolor as source of cacao, but not with T. cacao fruits.Judith Strupp Green. 2010.

He was also an Auckland local-body politician. Early life and family Dallow spent his childhood in Auckland and was educated at St Peter's College, Auckland.St Peter's College Magazine 1960, p. 83. He was the younger brother of Graeme DallowSusan Butterworth, p. 247. and the father of Simon and Matthew Dallow.\\"Wendt awarded top New Zealand honour\\", Stuff News, 5 September 2013. (Retrieved 5 September 2013) He was the grandson of Ernie Asher (Te Keepa Pouwhiuwhiu), a rugby union and rugby league football player of the early 1900s. In 1956, Dallow won the New Zealand under-19 men's discus throw title, representing Auckland, with a throw of . Police career Dallow was a significant personality in the management of race relations in the Auckland Police District in the 1970s. As inspector, he was originally in charge of the task force that Graeme Dallow had set up as a temporary expedient to deal with street disorder among the large MƒÅori and Pacific communities that had migrated to South Auckland. Later Ross Dallow headed the Community Relations Co-ordinators for five years. As leader of both units, Dallow worked on improving communications with MƒÅori and Pasifika leaders. For example, he took Assistant Race Relations Conciliator Pita Sharples out with the Task Force one night to show him the problems on the street, and won the influential support of the Conciliator's office. In 1976 Dallow promoted the expansion of Police education programmes in secondary schools. Hitherto such programmes were aimed at acquainting pupils with the role of the Police in society and creating a sense that the Police were trustworthy and approachable. Dallow believed that the Police had to introduce more sophisticated programmes because pupils were acquiring knowledge of law-related issues from \\"radical and civil liberties types who enter the schools under the guise of 'liberal studies' \\".Dallow quoted in Susan Butterworth, p. 240. After he became a superintendent, Dallow, in the face of the reluctance of many of his colleagues, spent much of his time addressing opinion-formers and cultivating a positive relationship with the media in relation to race relations and other police issues in Auckland.Susan Butterworth, pp. 247‚Äì248. Dallow was District Commander in West Auckland and the length of his police career was 36 years. In 1979, Dallow was one of the police team who served at the mortuary at Auckland University School of Medicine, where bodies recovered in the aftermath of the crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 on Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica, on 28 November 1979 were taken when they were returned to New Zealand. He was subsequently awarded the New Zealand Special Service Medal (Erebus). Local government Dallow was a member of the Waitakere City Council. In 2010 he was elected as an independent councillor on the Henderson-Massey Local Board of Auckland cityAuckland Council, Henderson Massey Local Board, Members (retrieved 14 December 2012) after an election campaign in which he was criticised for his use of police colours on his election placards and his comments on the \\"browning\\" of New Zealand at a West Auckland citizenship ceremony. Dallow did not stand again for the Auckland Council after his term expired in 2013. Dallow was a long-standing board member (1992‚Äì2016), of the Waitakere Licensing Trust, which owns and operates a chain of wholesale liquor outlets and public bars in West Auckland. He was chair of that board for eight years (1997‚Äì2005). He was re-elected as a member for a three-year term in the 2013 New Zealand local elections.Wayne Thompson, \\"Name change no help to success in elections\\", NZ Herald, 14 October 2013 (Retrieved 21 October 2013) Athletics coaching and administration Dallow was involved in athletics as a coach for over 30 years, enjoying considerable success. Athletes he trained set eight New Zealand records and won 31 national titles, and he was the manager of the Auckland team to the national track and field championships on many occasions. Serving on the committee of the Waitakere City Athletic Club, Dallow was instrumental in the fund-raising effort to build The Trusts Arena and Douglas Track and Field in Henderson, and his contributions were recognised with the West Auckland Legacy Award at the 2015 Sport Waitakere Excellence Awards.

Launched on March 1, 2009, Google Chrome Experiments is an official Google website that was originally meant to test the limits of JavaScript and the Google Chrome browser's performance and abilities. As the project progressed, it took the role of showcasing and experimenting latest open-source web-based technologies, such as JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, Canvas, SVG, CSS, and some others. All the projects on Chrome experiments are user submitted and are made using open source technologies. As of February 24, 2015, there were 1000 different Chrome projects posted on the website. History Google's Chrome Experiments was launched in March 2009 with 19 experiments The main reason for its inception was to demonstrate and test the abilities of JavaScript and Google's V8 JavaScript engine. With time it also started featuring other open source web-based technologies such as HTML5, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), WebGL, Web Audio, and Canvas element. The focus of the project throughout has been on open source technology and thus does not feature proprietary software such as Adobe Flash. The website is steadily gaining popularity along with the number of featured experiments. The number of experiments increased to 50 by August 2009, to 100 by July 2010, and to 500 by September 2012. As of August 2013 the number of experiments on the website were way over 600. The earliest projects featured on the site were mainly visualizations, interactive toys, and simple online games. The earliest contributors (according to Google's official blog) were made by artists and programmers like Casey Reas, Ricardo Cabello (Mr.doob), Ryan Alexander, Joshua T. Nimoy, and Karsten Schmidt (Toxi). Since its inception and launch, Chrome Experiments has featured only user submitted projects on their site, with a few exceptions of projects submitted by Google's teams. However these submissions are first curated by the Chrome Experiments team and then posted on the site for reviews and comments. It is also important to note that the user submitted projects are not hosted on the Google site; Google Chrome Experiments only posts a verified link to the developer's website. Major technologies used Google Chrome Experiments was originally started to demonstrate the usability of JavaScript alone, but with time it has now become a platform to showcase capabilities of some other open-source web based technologies such as WebGl, HTML5, SVG, and Canvas element. JavaScript JavaScript is a scripting language that is mainly used for creating for implementing dynamic website pages and enhanced user interfaces for web browsers. Highly influenced by programming languages such as C, Java, Self, and Scheme, JavaScript supports object oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles. Even though its name has Java in it, it is an entirely different language from Java. JavaScript is the main area of focus on Google Chrome Experiments, so nearly all of the experiments showcased on the site use JavaScript in some form or other. HTML5 HTML5 logo Hyper Text Markup language or HTML is the most used markup language for displaying web pages and the backbone language for internet itself. HTML5 is the 5th revision of HTML standards. It facilitates playing of audio and video elements in the browser itself, usage of Scalable Vector Graphics, and with the help of JavaScript or CSS3 programmers can even design animations. All Google Chrome experiments are browser based, thus all have some relation to HTML, and because of new Canvas element unique to HTML5, nearly all of the paint and design tools on the site along with some games, utilize HTML5 and Canvas 2-D element. Cascading Style Sheets Cascading style sheets (CSS) is style sheet language that is used to format the structure and look of a webpage written in markup languages such as HTML and XHTML. Along with markup languages it can also be used to format XML documents. CSS allows developers to move formatting attributes such as font color, font style, font size, background color, borders, section sizes, and other elements, to be moved in a single separate file resulting in much simpler code and much flexible handling of final rendering. Because of this feature, CSS is heavily used in nearly all Chrome experiments. WebGL WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API used for rendering 3-D and 2-D graphics and animations in the web browsers itself without any additional plugin. The web browser should be compatible with the API. WebGL is an open source API that is based on Open Graphic Library Embedded systems (OpenGL ES) and draws inspiration from Canvas 3-D element. WebGL is currently supported by Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, along with limited support by Safari and Opera. Internet Explorer, however, has no inbuilt support for WebGL until now but a user can view WebGL content on IE using additional browser plugins. Utilized by 529 experiments out of 1127, WebGL is one of the most commonly used technologies on the site. The technology has also gained active use in famous and useful online apps such as Google Maps, and Zygote Body (formerly Google Body) . HTML5 Audio Web audio or HTML5 audio, is the high level JavaScript API that is used for processing and playback of audio content on the browser itself, without any additional plugins. All experiments on the Google Chrome Experiment site are designed to be interactive and attractive, thus Web-audio is an integral part of most of these projects. Mobile On February 7, 2012, Google launched its first beta release of chrome web browser for mobiles, and on June 27, 2012 Google added a new section on the Google Chrome Experiment website dedicated to only mobile based applications. As of August 2013, there are 22 applications on the site. The major technologies utilized by these applications include JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

The railway is currently closed but a community based not-for-profit Society has been formed to try to save the railway and reopen it to the public. The Ida Bay Railway Preservation Society Inc has approached the Tasmanian Government (owner of the railway) with a funded plan for the staged reopening of the line. Early history of the area Tasmanian aborigines have occupied the island for a time still not precisely measured but confirmed as tens of thousands of years. The traditional owners of the land through which the railway runs were the Lyluequonny people. This clan of the South East nation occupied an area centred on what is now called Recherche Bay. In 1793 French scientists on the d‚ÄôEntrecasteaux expedition encountered the Lyluequonny. For a period in January 1793, with apparent goodwill and mutual respect, the two groups interacted and bemused each other. Because of the French journals kept at the time more is known about the Lyluequonny clan than any other in pre-European Tasmania. Following on from the arrival of the British in Tasmania in 1803, whalers, sealers and convicts were the first non- aboriginal inhabitants of the Far South. By 1822 the first land grant was made at Hythe (now Southport). The area south of Dover was reserved for timber. Convict probation stations were established at Dover and Hythe in the 1840s. By the early 1850s timber leases were made available and mill towns emerged, including at Lune River, Ramsgate (now Cockle Creek), Hastings and Leprena. This was the start of tramways in the area initially with timber rails and horse power.  Ida Bay Railway  Around 1919 an abandoned timber tramway of the Lune River mill (Huon Timber Co.) was improved and extended by the Hydro Electric Power and Metallurgic Company. The purpose was to transport limestone from a quarry at Marble Hill just south of Hastings Cave to a jetty at Brick Point, Ida Bay. The limestone was then loaded onto river ships, taken to Electrona in North West Bay south of Hobart and used in the preparation of calcium carbide. This was mainly used for the production of acetylene gas. During 1975, freight operations ceased. Following strong community action in support of keeping the railway operating it was purchased by the Tasmanian Government in 1977 and leased to private operators as a tourist attraction. Various lease holders ran the railway for years struggling to make a profit. After a period of closure, in 2004 the line re-opened and operated until a derailment in 2018. The line is not presently at the required standard for safe operation and extensive remediation is needed to reach benchmarks set by the National Rail Safety Regulator.  Present situation  In September 2018 a train derailment highlighted the poor state of repair of the rail line, and the Ida Bay train has not run since. The lease held by the operator has been terminated and the site has reverted to control and ownership by the Tasmanian Government. The Minister for Environment and Parks is directly responsible for the site and assets of the railway at this time. Little has been done to prevent further deterioration of the line, rolling stock and buildings and urgent maintenance and restoration of this heritage listed railway is needed. An Ida Bay Railway Preservation Society Inc has been formed and is pressing the Government to allow it to save the railway for future generations.

Zero-inflated Poisson One well-known zero-inflated model is Diane Lambert's zero-inflated Poisson model, which concerns a random event containing excess zero-count data in unit time. For example, the number of insurance claims within a population for a certain type of risk would be zero-inflated by those people who have not taken out insurance against the risk and thus are unable to claim. The zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model mixes two zero generating processes. The first process generates zeros. The second process is governed by a Poisson distribution that generates counts, some of which may be zero. The mixture is described as follows: : \\\\Pr (Y = 0) = \\\\pi + (1 - \\\\pi) e^{-\\\\lambda} :\\\\Pr (Y = y_i) = (1 - \\\\pi) \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^{y_i} e^{-\\\\lambda}} {y_i!},\\\\qquad y_i = 1,2,3,... where the outcome variable y_j has any non-negative integer value, \\\\lambda is the expected Poisson count for the ith individual; \\\\pi is the probability of extra zeros. The mean is (1-\\\\pi) \\\\lambda and the variance is \\\\lambda (1-\\\\pi) (1+\\\\pi \\\\lambda) . Estimators of ZIP Parameters The method of moments estimators are given by : \\\\hat{\\\\lambda}_{mo} = \\\\frac{s^2+m^2}{m} - 1, : \\\\hat{\\\\pi}_{mo} = \\\\frac{s^2-m}{s^2 + m^2-m}, where m is the sample mean and s^2 is the sample variance. The maximum likelihood estimator can be found by solving the following equation : m(1- e^{-\\\\hat{\\\\lambda}_{ml}}) = \\\\hat{\\\\lambda}_{ml} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{n_0}{n} \\\\right). where \\\\frac{n_0}{n} is the observed proportion of zeros. A closed form solution of this equation is given by : \\\\hat{\\\\lambda}_{ml} = W_{0}(-s e^{-s})+s with W_0 being the main branch of Lambert's W-function and : s = \\\\frac{ m }{1 - \\\\frac{n_0}{n}} . Alternatively, the equation can be solved by iteration. The maximum likelihood estimator for \\\\pi is given by : \\\\hat{\\\\pi}_{ml} = 1 - \\\\frac{m}{\\\\hat{\\\\lambda}_{ml}}. Related models 1994, Greene considered the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model. Daniel B. Hall adapted Lambert's methodology to an upper-bounded count situation, thereby obtaining a zero- inflated binomial (ZIB) model. Discrete pseudo compound Poisson model If the count data Y is such that the probability of zero is larger than the probability of nonzero, namely : \\\\Pr (Y = 0) > 0.5 then the discrete data Y obey discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution. In fact, let G(z) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n = 0}^\\\\infty P(Y = n)z^n be the probability generating function of y_i. If p_0=\\\\Pr (Y = 0) > 0.5 , then G(z) \\\\geqslant p_0 - \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i = 1}^\\\\infty p_i = 2p_0-1 > 0. Then from the Wiener‚ÄìL√©vy theorem, G(z) has the probability generating function of the discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution. We say that the discrete random variable Y satisfying probability generating function characterization : G_Y(z) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n = 0}^\\\\infty P(Y = n)z^n = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha_k \\\\lambda (z^k - 1)\\\\right), \\\\quad (z \\\\le 1) has a discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution with parameters : (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots ) = (\\\\alpha_1 \\\\lambda,\\\\alpha_2 \\\\lambda, \\\\ldots ) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\infty \\\\left( \\\\sum_{k = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha _k = 1, \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha_k < \\\\infty, \\\\alpha_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R},\\\\lambda > 0 \\\\right). When all the \\\\alpha_k are non- negative, it is the discrete compound Poisson distribution (non-Poisson case) with overdispersion property.

She also won two medals for the same category at the Mediterranean Games. Background Del Din started shooting as her sporting discipline at the age of 16. She first competed for San Marino at the 1989 ISSF World Shooting Championships in Montecatini, Italy, where she placed fourth in trap shooting. Shortly after the championships, Del Din relinquished the sport to focus on her personal life and career as an accountant. Leaving retirement In 2005, Del Din finally came out of retirement, when she captured her first medal in trap shooting at the Mediterranean Games in Almer√≠a, Spain. Two years later, she was ranked number three in the world by ISSF, after winning silver and bronze medals at the ISSF World Shooting Championships in Nicosia, Cyprus, and at the final ISSF World Cup in Belgrade, Serbia, respectively. She also scored 68 points at the fourth meet of the World Cup in Maribor, Slovenia, finishing only in thirteenth place. Her top-level success at the shooting competitions allowed Del Din to qualify for the Olympics. The following year, Del Din added her second silver medal at the World Cup in Suhl, Germany, finishing behind Rossi by just a single point in the final. At age thirty-seven, Del Din made her official debut for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where she became the nation's first female flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Del Din competed for the women's trap shooting, where she placed fifteenth out of the twenty shooters in the qualifying rounds, behind France's Delphine Racinet by three targets in the final attempt, with a total score of 62 points.

The film is about three Chinese men traveling in Thailand: two competing scientists searching for their boss, and a tourist eager to explore the country. The film is Xu's directorial debut. The film grossed more than US$200 million at the Chinese box-office, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time in China when it was released. It was the first movie in China to earn over a billion yuan, overtaking Titanic which earned around 975 million yuan in theatrical release. Plot The story begins with a scientist, Xu Lang (Xu Zheng), who invented a solution (youba, lit. Oil Master, translated as \\"Supergas\\") which has the power of increasing the volume of any liquid to which the solution is applied. Such a solution implies great potential profitability if applied to gasoline or any precious liquid. However, he needs the authorization of Mr. Zhou, the biggest shareholder, in order to get further funding from an investment fund. Gao Bo (Huang Bo), who was the classmate of Xu in college and his partner at the workplace, wants to sell the invention to a French company instead. Upon the discovery that Mr. Zhou is in Thailand, Xu Lang immediately embarks on a trip to Thailand, constantly tailed by Gao. On the plane, Xu meets a young man named Wang Bao (Wang Baoqiang), who is going to Thailand to fulfill a list of dreams (including fighting a Muay Thai master, planting a cactus). Wang owns a scallion pancake store in Beijing, and claims that the famous actress Fan Bingbing is his girlfriend. Not wanting to be bothered by Wang, Xu keeps trying to get rid of him, but events unfold in such a way that the two become a team. The two go on a hunt to find Mr. Zhou. The interaction between the savvy businessman and the pious, simple-minded chef is a source of most of the dialog in the film. Two to undergo major culture shock in Thailand, while Wang is frustrated with the progress in finding Mr. Zhou. Attempting to blame Wang for the whole mishap, Xu finds cash in Wang's wallet. Considering that Wang lost all his money earlier in the trip, Xu Lang suspects that he is a spy for Gao and tears apart Wang Bao's diary. Xu goes on to read Wang's diary and discovers that Wang is writing tourist diaries attempting to cheer up his mother, who has Alzheimer's Disease, is a fan of actress Fan Bingbing, and wishes that Wang was in a relationship. Moved by Wang's diaries, Xu regains his trust for Wang. Finally finding the temple where Mr. Zhou is supposed to be located, Wang encounters a Buddhist layman who brings a case which contains the authorization letter. The layman goes on to say that Mr. Zhou has indicated that it is up to them what they want to do with the letter. Gao shows up with a Muay Thai master (Saichia Wongwirot) and starts fighting to gain control of the case. Gao and Xu go on to fight frantically for the case, while Wang is overpowered by the Muay Thai master. Xu lets go of the letter and ultimately decides to fulfill Wang's wish of taking a picture of defeating a Thai boxer instead. Xu comes over and lies down and serves as his takeoff board. Stepping on Xu's chest, Wang flies up into the sky and defeats the Muay Thai master with a massive kick to the head. Upon reading the letter, Gao goes on to find out that they need to cosign the authorization letter to validate it. At this point, Xu discovers that he does not care about the letter anymore, and he feels guilty for not having given enough attention to his wife (Xu Zheng's real-life wife Tao Hong) and daughter. Through the trip, Xu goes through a metamorphosis from a callous, manipulative businessman to an epiphany of what is really important in life. Wang, on the other hand, inadvertently fulfills every single one of his dreams during the trip in Thailand. Towards the end, Xu reunites with his wife and brings the family back from the brink of divorce. Wang actually meets with the real Fan Bingbing through Xu's arrangement. Fan is moved by Wang's love for his mother, and agrees to take pictures with Wang inside a studio. Gao, still trapped in Thailand due to the loss of his passport which was stolen by Wang earlier, is happy hearing his wife giving birth to their baby over the phone. The story ends on a positive note. Release The film premiered on December 12, 2012. On January 1, 2013, the film crossed over the 1 billion yuan mark, the first Chinese film to do so. It had previously beat James Cameron's 3D re-issue of Titanic which grossed RMB975 million and previous Chinese record holder Painted Skin: The Resurrection which had grossed RMB727 million. Cameron's Avatar still holds the record as China's highest grossing film, with RMB1.39 billion (US$223 million) on release in 2010 but Lost in Thailand has already overtaken the 3D film by number of tickets sold. Reception Variety wrote that the film is \\"lightweight entertainment\\" and \\"is no masterpiece, but has proven a refreshing antidote to the year-end glut of blockbusters\\" and it is \\"unexpectedly well honed for a debut feature.\\" Derek Elley of Film Business Asia gave the film an 8 out 10, and states \\"The chemistry between leads Xu Zheng and Wang Baoqiang that made Lost on Journey (2010) one of the most delightful sleeper hits of its year survives happily intact in Lost in Thailand\\", and \\"Thailand is in every way a much more commercial package. There's less depth to the new characters, the humour is more overstated and less grounded in reality, and overall the movie packs less of an emotional punch in its latter stages; but it's more slickly tooled and less digressive in its construction, halting on its path only briefly to review the plot and the central relationship.\\" According to Wall Street Journal, \\"The film‚Äôs success has shaken up the landscape of the movie industry in China, where big- budget historical epics and martial-arts and action films often dominate the box office.\\" Following the movie's release, tourism from China to Thailand skyrocketed, growing 60% in both 2012 and 2013.  Lawsuit  The film bears similar name to Lost on Journey in Chinese, and shares the same lead actors. It is, however, not a direct sequel to the 2010 movie as the two movies are produced by different companies and have different directors. In March 2013, Wuhan Huaqi Media, the production company for Lost on Journey, filed a lawsuit against the four companies involved in Lost in Thailand before Beijing High People‚Äôs Court claiming that the production and release of Lost in Thailand involves copyright infringement and unfair competition by exploiting the success of Lost on Journey without its producer‚Äôs authorization. The court ruled against Lost in Thailand and ordered Beijing Enlight Pictures to cease all unfair practices and pay Huaqi RMB 85 million in damages.

He holds numerous national records in the 200 and 400 m freestyle, and had represented his nation San Marino in two editions of the Olympic Games (2004 and 2008). Nicolini made his first Sammarinese team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where he competed in the men's 400 m freestyle. Swimming in heat one, he came home strongly at the final stretch to post a third-place time and forty-second overall in 4:08.28, just seven seconds behind the winner Miguel Mendoza of the Philippines. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Nicolini swam the first heat of the 200 m freestyle, against Georgia's Irakli Revishvili and Macedonia's Mihajlo Ristovski. He closed out a small field to last place with the slowest prelims time of 1:59.47, finishing two seconds behind the winner Ristovski. Nicolini, however, failed to advance into the semifinals, as he placed fifty-seventh in the overall rankings.

The Invasion of Umuahia occurred during the final stages of the Civil War and happened within 15 days of Biafran surrender. Background Ever since the early stages of the Nigerian Civil War, both sides had been fighting for control of the Imo State. The Imo State was particularly important due to its capital, Owerri. Owerri was first invaded by the Nigerians on September 17, 1968, during Operation OAU and it was kept under Nigerian control until the Capture of Owerri in early 1969. Oguta had been attacked many times before and it became an important city during the war. It lay directly in the path of Owerri but it was heavily fortified by Biafran soldiers. Many roads connecting Oguta and Owerri to Nigerian-controlled cities were purposely destroyed by Biafran soldiers to delay attacks by the Nigerian army. After the large Nigerian loss at Owerri, Col. Benjamin Adekunle was replaced by Col. Olusegun Obasanjo. Since Oguta had been gained and lost two times in the last year, Nigerian Head of State Yakubu Gowon ordered a final attack on Oguta and Owerri. Battle In May 1969 Murtala Muhammad and Mohammed Shuwa made their ways towards Oguta. Biafran President Odumegwu Ojukwu ordered Col. Omorowa, Adgara Ike, and Joseph Achuzie to defend the city. Before the arrival of the Nigerians Joseph Hannibal was able to destroy the Port Harcourt ‚Äì Owerri road and the Owerri ‚Äì Onitsha road. In late May 1969 Mohammed Shuwa arrived with a large force of men in downtown Oguta. A large gun battle ensued and ended with the retreat of Shuwa's men and over 500 dead on both sides. Olusegun Obasanjo arrived with Murtala Muhammad in July 1969 with over 30 tanks and over 10,000 men. Obasanjo's men surrounded the city and began shelling the city. Over 30% of the city's population fled with over 2,200 civilians killed or wounded in the crossfire. The Biafrans managed to keep Oguta under their control for another 3 months but lost it when Olusegun Obasanjo invaded the city with full force on October 9, 1969. Even though Oguta was captured by the Nigerians they were unable to capture Owerri. Aftermath The war remained at a stalemate until the invasion of Umuahia on December 24, 1969. The Biafran capital was moved to Owerri and there it stayed until the surrender of the country to the Nigerians on January 15, 1970.
