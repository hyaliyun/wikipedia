It was also screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. In January 2015, the film received three nominations at the 20th Lumi√®res Awards and also two nominations at the 40th C√©sar Awards. Plot Charlie (Jos√©phine Japy) is a teenage high school student whose parents are breaking up. At school she is assigned to take care of new student Sarah (Lou de La√¢ge) who has recently moved from Nigeria, where her mother works, to live with her aunt. The two quickly become inseparable. During All Saints' Day Sarah tells Charlie that her mother is unable to visit and she'll be alone. Charlie invites Sarah to spend time with her mother and her mother's friends for the holiday. Sarah's attitude towards Charlie abruptly changes when they are on vacation when Charlie introduces Sarah as a classmate and not as a friend. Sarah then alternates between being warm to Charlie and being cold and freezing her out. When they return from their vacation Sarah ignores Charlie and Charlie practices asking her what is wrong when she sees her at school. However, when Sarah gets to school Charlie warmly embraces her acting as though nothing is wrong. Charlie continues to grow suspicious of Sarah and the way she acts. In front of their group of friends she points out inconsistencies in Sarah's stories about her mother. Sarah casually threatens to tell Charlie's friends about her abusive father, which Charlie confided to her in secret. In order to find out the truth about Sarah, Charlie follows her home from school where she learns she lives in a rough part of town with her alcoholic mother. At a New Year's party Charlie tells Sarah that she saw her mother and that she, Sarah, isn't really mean. Sarah threatens to kill her if she tells anyone, and the two stop being friendly. After Charlie hears Sarah telling another one of their friends that Charlie never lost her virginity with her ex Lucas because she cried too much, she threatens to tell everyone about Sarah's mother. In retaliation Sarah graffitis \\"Charlie is a whore\\" all over the school. Though her friends try to rally around her, Charlie does nothing to stop Sarah's abuse. Eventually Sarah shows up at Charlie's house crying because her mother hit her and she felt she had nowhere else to go. Charlie readily forgives her, telling her that she is only upset when they're apart. However, the next day at school Sarah once again ignores her, even giving a necklace she was given by Charlie's mom to another girl as a present. Charlie lashes out by attacking the girl. Sarah comes by Charlie's place to collect her things after school is out for the summer. They sit on Charlie's bed, and Sarah taunts Charlie by saying that Charlie is an abuser playing a victim. Sarah tells Charlie that she plans to move to Paris with another friend to attend college while Charlie will be stuck in their small town for the rest of her life. Charlie cracks and pushes Sarah, who hits her head on a drawer. Sarah climbs back up and falls back onto the bed and begins laughing. Enraged and extremely distraught, Charlie suffocates her with a pillow. When Charlie's mother returns home, Charlie cries an apology, telling her mother that \\"She is upstairs,\\" before having a panic attack. Her mother goes upstairs and screams upon finding Sarah's body. Charlie manages to slow down her breathing and looks directly into the camera before it cuts to black.

Metate Modica Chocolate traditional ingot bar The specialty was introduced in the County of Modica by the Spaniards, during their domination in southern Italy. The Spaniards probably learned from the Aztecs the technique of processing cocoa beans through the use of metate, but it is however known that the Aztecs were not aware of the existence of sugar and consumed cocoa in liquid form, therefore it is not possible to state that Modica Chocolate (which also contains sugar in addition to cocoa, which has the characteristic ingot shape and is presented in a solid state) derives from an Aztec Recipe. Modica Chocolate is cold processed and has no cocoa butter added, at 45 degrees celsius sugar does not dissolve;that's why it has a different texture. According to the age old Modica cold working process all the beneficial properties of cocoa are kept intact. Modica chocolate often has a white patina and tends to crumble. The cocoa butter blooming alters the traditional organoleptic properties of the product. Since 2009 a festival named \\"Chocobarocco\\" is held every year in the city.

History Little of the original church remains but it is known that in 1748 Nathaniel Ireson, a local architect built and paid for a new chancel, which has been removed in subsequent renovations, and carved several of the memorial tablets. In 1793 the tower was raised by making it high, five bells were cast and a sixth added. Because of the state of the roofs, which are under repair, the church is included on the Heritage at Risk Register. Architecture The stone building has almost flat lead roofs behind parapets. It consists of a nave, chancel, north aisle and a double width south aisle, organ chamber, lady chapel, and north porch. The porch which was built in 1891 has a cavalry scene above the arch. The three-stage tower is supported by diagonal offset buttresses and a corner stair turret. The east window has stained glass by Clayton and Bell which was installed in 1889. Churchyard The churchyard includes a self designed and carved monument to Nathaniel Ireson who died in 1769. The statue in 18th century costume faces south west and stands on a square plinth inscribed to Nathanial Ireson and his family. The pedestal has been replaced since the original statue was erected. Another memorial, erected early in the 19th century is to Elliot Grasset Thomas and his family. Only the plinth with his coat of arms survives from the original structure. The stone walls and gateways around the churchyard were built in 1818. The north east gateway is the largest of several entrances to the site.

It is located on the banks of the New River near the community of Fosters Falls. The site has clear evidence of occupation during the Late Woodland period, and offers evidence of older occupation. Finds at the site include pottery sherds, stone tools, ceramic and shell trade items, and grave sites. Located on the New River floodplain, the site is protected by extensive alluvial deposits; it was cultivated for many years, but the river deposits are deep enough that the village site was never reached by the plow. Only an accident revealed the site: the resident, William Martin, was developing a campground on the site in May 1970 and encountered human bones while placing a septic tank. Local law enforcement quickly deemed the bones a prehistoric site, and an archaeologist from Richmond arrived within a few days to begin examining the location. Excavation began in July.MacCord, Howard A. \\"The Martin Site (44WY13), Wythe County, Virginia\\". Quarterly bulletin of the Archeological Society of Virginia 53.4 (1998): 171-203 Large numbers of Late Archaic and Early Woodland projectile points were found at the site, leading the excavators to deem it a long-used village, but it was most densely occupied by the Dan River culture during the Late Woodland period, at which time it comprised a collection of circular houses possibly surrounded by a palisade. Most of the artifacts at the site, including more than sixteen thousand sherds, are attributed to the Dan River occupation, although radiocarbon dating provided a date of 1440 BC for one of the earlier cultures present at the site. As well as the human bones discovered by the owner, non-human bones are also plentiful, with deer being the most common, and typical New River mollusks, including clams, mussels, and Polygyra periwinkles. Because no European-produced trade goods are present at the site, occupation is believed to have ended before 1600. It may be contemporary with the Cornett Site about to the west near Austinville.

It overlooks a portion of Howe Reservoir located south of the road, and has fine views of Mount Monadnock. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, end chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the main entrance. The entrance features Federal style sidelight windows and a semi-oval transom. A single-story hip-roof porch extends across the front, supported by square posts. The house was built between 1825 and 1830 by Samuel Allison, a captain in the local militia and later town selectman. Allison established a sawmill nearby in 1830, but sold it in 1848 when he moved to Marlborough. The front porch is a later 19th- century addition. The subsequent house owners also operated the sawmill; one of them was Micah Howe, for whom the reservoir is named. The house is stylistically similar to the Rufus Piper Homestead.

Alexander said that she fired a warning shot after her husband attacked her and threatened to kill her on August 1, 2010, in Jacksonville, Florida. Alexander was released on January 27, 2015, under a plea deal that capped her sentence to the three years she had already served. Incident Alexander was in the home of her estranged husband Rico Gray, when Alexander stated that Gray threatened to kill her via texts on Alexander's phone. Gray had previously abused Alexander, giving her reason to believe that her life was in danger. According to Alexander, she tried to escape through the garage, but the garage door would not open. This account was confirmed by Gray in a sworn deposition, although investigators found no problem with the door. According to all accounts, Alexander then retrieved her gun from her vehicle and went to the kitchen. Alexander fired a \\"warning shot\\" towards Gray with his children nearby, which hit the wall near Gray at the height of his head, then deflected into the ceiling. The single shot did not injure anyone. According to one source, Alexander had fired the warning shot because of Florida's stand-your-ground law, a law that allows self-defense, such as lethal force, in life-threatening situations, but a warning shot was not legal at that time. Trials Alexander, who had a history of suffering domestic violence from Gray and obtained a restraining order because of it, sought self-defense immunity prior to trial but was unsuccessful. State Attorney Angela Corey met with the defendant and offered her a three-year plea deal. Asserting that she acted in self-defense within the bounds of the law, Alexander rejected the offer and took her case to trial. A jury convicted her in twelve minutes, and because of the Florida 10-20-Life mandatory minimum statute, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Alexander was also requested to stay away from Gray as part of a court order. On September 26, 2013, an appellate court ordered a new trial, finding that the jury instructions in Alexander's trial impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense.Opinion in Marissa Alexander v. State of Florida Alexander was released on bail on November 27, 2013 and required to stay under house arrest. Corey announced that she intended to re-prosecute Alexander, this time aiming for three consecutive 20 year sentences, amounting to a mandatory 60-year sentence if Alexander is found guilty in a second trial. On January 27, 2015, Alexander was released from a Jacksonville jail under a plea deal that capped her sentence to the three years she had already served. She pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated assault for firing a shot in the direction of her husband. She also agreed to serve two years of house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor. She will be allowed to work, attend classes and take her children to school and medical appointments. Her case helped to inspire a new state law permitting warning shots in some circumstances. Criticism of prosecutor Angela Corey Corey was criticized for her handling of the case by Democratic Florida Congresswoman Corrine Brown, who argued that Corey overcharged Alexander and the result of Alexander's case was a consequence of institutional racism. Mariame Kaba, Rev. Jesse Jackson, anti-domestic violence advocates, civil rights groups, and others also supported the call for Alexander's release from prison. Several groups such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the national advocacy group Color of Change petitioned to ask for Corey's removal from this case. NOW called for Corey to resign over the case, saying Corey was \\"misusing her office and endangering domestic violence survivors.\\" Color of Change stated that they would attempt to collect 100,000 signatures to remove Corey from the case. Corey has defended herself by saying that she believes Alexander fired the weapon out of anger and not fear, and that she endangered the lives of Gray's two children in the process. Corey said, \\"She discharged a gun to kill them.\\" Aftermath In March 2017, Alexander expressed support for reducing minimum sentencing laws and speaking on behalf of women who suffered domestic abuse. She also spoke in favor of strengthening the Stand Your Ground law with the intent of making it more \\"fair\\" and that it can be made \\"more balanced\\".

Somatosensory afferent fibres  There are four main types of sensory fibres responsible for somatosensation: AŒ±, AŒ≤, AŒ¥ and C fibres (more details can be found at the axon page). The AŒ≤ fibres are from cutaneous mechanoreceptors and respond to touch stimuli; the AŒ¥ and C fibres are nociceptor afferents which respond to painful stimuli. The touch fibres have a larger diameter than the pain fibres, which means that they transmit their action potentials much faster than the smaller diameter fibres.  Gate Control Theory  = Melzack and Wall = The Gate Control Theory of Pain, first proposed in the 1960s by Melzack and Wall, states that the concurrent activation of tactile afferent nerve fibers inhibits activation of nociceptive afferent fibres. Melzack and Wall suggested that a gating mechanism is present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. They suggested that both touch and pain afferent fibres synapse on to 'projection cells' and inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. It is the projection cells which then travel up the spinothalamic tract to the brain. Interactions between these connections is thought to mediate the perception of painful stimuli: # With no input, the inhibitory interneuron stops signals being sent to the brain from the projection neuron, i.e. the gate is closed. # Stimulation of large tactile afferents leads to somatosensory input. The inhibitory interneuron and projection neuron are both activated, but the inhibitory interneuron stops signals travelling to the brain via the projection neuron, i.e. the gate is closed. # Nociception occurs if there is greater stimulation of the smaller pain afferents. The interneuron becomes inactivated, so that the projection neuron can send signals to the brain leading to pain perception, i.e. the gate is open. The theory shows that rubbing a painful site leads to stimulation of somatosensory input to projector neurons, which reduces the intensity of pain perceived. = Development of the Gate Control Theory = More recently neurophysiological studies in animals have indicated that the wide range dynamic neurons (WDR neurons) in the dorsal horn are the homologue of Wall and Melzack's proposed projector neurons and inhibitory interneurons. The neurons are multimodal (respond to both touch and pain input), with an inhibitory surround receptive field. Experiments looking at the WDR neurons in animals have shown that a strong tactile stimulus in the peripheral inhibitory field could reduce the response to a painful stimulus to the same extent as a weak tactile stimulus closer to the centre of the receptive field. These data show the Gate Control Theory of Pain was correct in the prediction that activation of large tactile afferent fibres inhibit the nociceptive afferent signal being transmitted to the brain.  Interactions between touch and pain  The interactions between touch and pain are mostly inhibitory (as is predicted by the Gate Control Theory). Research shows that there both acute and chronic pain perception is influenced by touch, with both psychophysical changes and differences in brain activation. = Touch and acute pain = The intensity of pain reported is consistently reduced in response to touch. This occurs whether the touch is at the same time as the pain, or even if the touch occurs before the pain. Touch also reduces the activation of cortical areas that respond to painful stimuli. = Touch and chronic pain = Individuals suffering from chronic pain tend to show reduced tactile sensitivity in the affected area. This means that they find it more difficult to distinguish whether there is one or two tactile points on the skin surface when the points are very close together. If patients are trained on the task of discriminating between two tactile points, it is shown that participants report reduced intensity of chronic pain.

ShortStraw is currently signed to their independently formed publishing label Boosh Records in South Africa, with digital distribution by Sony Music. History The band was formed in 2007 as a two-piece consisting of Oliver Nathan (drums and backing vocals) and Alastair Thomas (lead vocals and guitar). Jason Hartford (guitar and keyboard) joined the band in 2008 and Phil Brierley (bass) later joined the band in 2009. In 2011, Jason Hartford and Phil Brierley left the band and were later replaced by Gad De Combes (keyboard and backing vocals), Tom Revington (lead guitar) and Russell Grant (bass). Jake Rubinstein replaced Oliver Nathan on drums in June 2013 to complete the current line-up It wasn't until the recording of their first EP, We Slept Through it All in late 2008 that the group realised they needed a bassist to replicate the EP live. To solve this problem they recruited Phil Brierley in 2009 to complete the original line-up. After playing various shows across the country for the next two years, Jason Hartford and Phil Brierley left the band in 2011 to pursue personal interests. They were replaced by Gad De Combes, Tom Revington and Russell Grant to transform the band into a five-piece outfit. Shortstraw's debut album, You're Underfed, I'm Wonderful was written, recorded and produced by the original line up in 2011 along with friend Chris Brink who mixed and mastered the album. Tom, Gad and Russell joined the band just before the album was ready for release. The album was well received across South Africa and the video for their single \\"One Long Day\\" went to number 1 on the MK Top 10 Music Videos Chart. The band won a grant to produce a music video for their song, Waterworks through the MK Music Video Project. The Song \\"One Long Day\\" was featured in the then new Nissan X-Trail advertisement in late 2012. In 2013, the band won the Best Indie MK Award for their music video for One Long Day. In April 2013 the band released their second album Good Morning, Sunshine. The album was recorded at High Seas Records in Rosebank, Johannesburg. It was produced by Jacques du Plessis and Marc de la Querra from High Seas Records. Grammy Award winning producer Darryl Torr had some production input on the track called \\"Gimme My Fix\\" and Cape Town based producer Teejay Terreblanche was involved with \\"Bikini Weather\\". Singer Shane Durrant from popular South African band Desmond and the Tutus, as well as local hip hop star Zubz made guest appearances on the album. This was the first album where all tracks were written and recorded by the new five-piece line-up. This resulted in a more mature and well-rounded sound for the band. The band was described as one of the highlights of the Cape Town 'Up the Creek' festival in February 2014. Good Morning Sunshine won best album at the 2014 MK awards, Couch Potato reached no. 4 on 5FM's top 40, Good Morning Sunshine reached no 3 5FM's top 40 and Bikini Weather no 19 5FM's top 40. The Good Morning, Sunshine music video also went to number 1 on the South African MTV Rock Chart. The band won best video at the 2014 MK Awards for their 2011 release Waterworks from their first album You're Underfed, I'm Wonderful. Youthless was Released 5 January 2015.

Superconducting computing is a form of cryogenic computing, as superconductive electronic circuits require cooling to cryogenic temperatures for operation, typically below 10 kelvin. Often superconducting computing is applied to quantum computing, with an important application known as superconducting quantum computing. Superconducting digital logic circuits use single flux quanta (SFQ), also known as magnetic flux quanta, to encode, process, and transport data. SFQ circuits are made up of active Josephson junctions and passive elements such as inductors, resistors, transformers, and transmission lines. Whereas voltages and capacitors are important in semiconductor logic circuits such as CMOS, currents and inductors are most important in SFQ logic circuits. Power can be supplied by either direct current or alternating current, depending on the SFQ logic family.  Fundamental concepts  The primary advantage of superconducting computing is improved power efficiency over conventional CMOS technology. Much of the power consumed, and heat dissipated, by conventional processors comes from moving information between logic elements rather than the actual logic operations. Because superconductors have zero electrical resistance, little energy is required to move bits within the processor. This is expected to result in power consumption savings of a factor of 500 for an exascale computer. For comparison, in 2014 it was estimated that a 1 exaFLOPS computer built in CMOS logic is estimated to consume some 500 megawatts of electrical power.Kogge P (2011). \\"The tops in flops\\", IEEE Spectrum, vol. 48, pp. 48‚Äì54, 2011. Superconducting logic can be an attractive option for ultrafast CPUs, where switching times are measured in picoseconds and operating frequencies approach 770 GHz.Courtland R (2011). \\"Superconductor Logic Goes Low-Power\\", IEEE spectrum, 22 June 2011Holmes DS, Ripple AL, Manheimer MA (2013). \\"Energy- efficient superconducting computing‚Äîpower budgets and requirements\\", IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond., vol. 23, 1701610, June 2013. However, since transferring information between the processor and the outside world does still dissipate energy, superconducting computing was seen as well-suited for communications-intensive tasks where the data largely stays in the cryogenic environment, rather than big data applications where large amounts of information are streamed from outside the processor. As superconducting logic supports standard digital machine architectures and algorithms, the existing knowledge base for CMOS computing will still be useful in constructing superconducting computers. However, given the reduced heat dissipation, it may enable innovations such as three-dimensional stacking of components. However, as they require inductors, it is harder to reduce their size. As of 2014, devices using niobium as the superconducting material operating at 4 K were considered state-of-the-art. Important challenges for the field were reliable cryogenic memory, as well as moving from research on individual components to large-scale integration. Josephson junction count is a measure of superconducting circuit or device complexity, similar to the transistor count used for semiconductor integrated circuits.  History  Superconducting computing research has been pursued by the U. S. National Security Agency since the mid-1950s. However, progress could not keep up with the increasing performance of standard CMOS technology. As of 2016 there are no commercial superconducting computers, although research and development continues. Research in the mid-1950s to early 1960s focused on the cryotron invented by Dudley Allen Buck, but the liquid-helium temperatures and the slow switching time between superconducting and resistive states caused this research to be abandoned. In 1962 Brian Josephson established the theory behind the Josephson effect, and within a few years IBM had fabricated the first Josephson junction. By the mid 1970s IBM had constructed a superconducting quantum interference device using these junctions, mainly working with lead-based junctions and later switching to lead/niobium junctions. However, the program was shut down in 1983 because the technology was not considered competitive with standard semiconductor technology. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry funded a superconducting research effort from 1981 to 1989 that produced the ETL-JC1, which was a 4-bit machine with 1,000 bits of RAM. In 1983, Bell Labs created niobium/aluminum oxide Josephson junctions that were more reliable and easier to fabricate. In 1985, the Rapid single flux quantum logic scheme, which had improved speed and energy efficiency, was developed by researchers at Moscow State University. These advances led to the United States' Hybrid Technology Multi-Threaded project, started in 1997, which sought to beat conventional semiconductors to the petaflop computing scale. The project was abandoned in 2000, however, and the first conventional petaflop computer was constructed in 2008. After 2000, attention turned to superconducting quantum computing. The 2011 introduction of reciprocal quantum logic by Quentin Herr of Northrop Grumman, as well as energy-efficient rapid single flux quantum by Hypres, were seen as major advances. The push for exascale computing beginning in the mid-2010s, as codified in the National Strategic Computing Initiative, was seen as an opening for superconducting computing research as exascale computers based on CMOS technology would be expected to require impractical amounts of electrical power. The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, formed in 2006, currently coordinates the U. S. Intelligence Community's research and development efforts in superconducting computing.  Conventional computing techniques  Despite the names of many of these techniques containing the word \\"quantum\\", they are not necessarily platforms for quantum computing. =Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) = Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) superconducting logic was developed in the Soviet Union in the 1980s.Likharev KK, Semenov VK (1991). \\"RSFQ logic/memory family: a new Josephson-junction technology for sub- terahertz-clock-frequency digital systems\\", IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, Vol. 1, No. 1, March 1991, pp. 3-28. Information is carried by the presence or absence of a single flux quantum (SFQ). The Josephson junctions are critically damped, typically by addition of an appropriately sized shunt resistor, to make them switch without a hysteresis. Clocking signals are provided to logic gates by separately distributed SFQ voltage pulses. Power is provided by bias currents distributed using resistors that can consume more than 10 times as much static power than the dynamic power used for computation. The simplicity of using resistors to distribute currents can be an advantage in small circuits and RSFQ continues to be used for many applications where energy efficiency is not of critical importance. RSFQ has been used to build specialized circuits for high-throughput and numerically intensive applications, such as communications receivers and digital signal processing. Josephson junctions in RSFQ circuits are biased in parallel. Therefore, the total bias current grows linearly with the Josephson junction count. This currently presents the major limitation on the integration scale of RSFQ circuits, which does not exceed a few tens of thousands of Josephson junctions per circuit. =LR-RSFQ= Reducing the resistor (R) used to distribute currents in traditional RSFQ circuits and adding an inductor (L) in series can reduce the static power dissipation and improve energy efficiency.Yamanashi Y, Nishigai T, and Yoshikawa N (2007). \\"Study of LR- loading technique for low-power single flux quantum circuits\\", IEEE Trans.

Supercond., vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 1701104, June 2013. =Energy-Efficient Single Flux Quantum Technology (ERSFQ/eSFQ)= Efficient rapid single flux quantum (ERSFQ) logic was developed to eliminate the static power losses of RSFQ by replacing bias resistors with sets of inductors and current-limiting Josephson junctions.Mukhanov OA (2011). \\"Energy-Efficient Single Flux Quantum Technology\\", IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, vol.21, no.3, pp.760-769, June 2011.DE Kirichenko, S Sarwana, AF Kirichenko (2011). \\"Zero Static Power Dissipation Biasing of RSFQ Circuits\\", IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, vol.21, no.3, pp.776-779, June 2011. Efficient single flux quantum (eSFQ) logic is also powered by direct current, but differs from ERSFQ in the size of the bias current limiting inductor and how the limiting Josephson junctions are regulated.Volkmann MH, Sahu A, Fourie CJ, and Mukhanov OA (2013). \\"Implementation of energy efficient single flux quantum (eSFQ) digital circuits with sub-aJ/bit operation\\", Supercond.

RQL uses reciprocal pairs of SFQ pulses to encode a logical '1'. Both power and clock are provided by multi-phase alternating current signals. RQL gates do not use resistors to distribute power and thus dissipate negligible static power.Herr QP, Herr AY, Oberg OT, and Ioannidis AG (2011). \\"Ultra-low-power superconductor logic\\", J. Appl.

Quantum computing techniques  Superconducting quantum computing is a promising implementation of quantum information technology that involves nanofabricated superconducting electrodes coupled through Josephson junctions. As in a superconducting electrode, the phase and the charge are conjugate variables. There exist three families of superconducting qubits, depending on whether the charge, the phase, or neither of the two are good quantum numbers. These are respectively termed charge qubits, flux qubits, and hybrid qubits.

History The area where the park stands today used to be part of the Zhongdu Industrial Area during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the area became the center of plywood factories. After many of the factories closed down in the 1980s because of moving out from Taiwan, the area was left idle and not maintained, including all of the wood storage ditches. It became the breeding ground for dengue fever and crime. The Kaohsiung City Government then made a decision to revitalize the area by allocating NT$3 billion of budget. The construction of the park marked the beginning of improvement in the overall value of the region in 2009. Old buildings were demolished, the advantages were relocated and a wetland was established. The aim was to change the appearance of Zhongdu region and solve the environmental problem troubling the area in the past 4 decades. The construction of the park commenced on 15 January 2010 and completed on 24 April 2011. Also constructed around the park are a 30-meter parkway and the Zhongdu Vision Bridge. Geology The park is located along the Love River and covers an area of 12.6 hectares. It connects the waterfront green and open spaces along the river to form a network of ecological wetland corridor. Ecology Currently there are 39 species of birds, 3 species of reptiles, and 9 species of beetles. Architecture The design of the park is based on the establishment of mangrove forest environment. The remains of the wood storage ditches were expanded into a circular waterway that is connected to the Love River. At the enter of the park lies the Central Ecological Islet. The park also features a visitor center, activity areas and outdoor ecological classrooms. Transportation The park is accessible within walking distance northeast of Gushan Station of Taiwan Railways.

The description was created by the Pilotage Act 1987, at which point a CHA had to be one whose harbour was wholly or partly within a pilotage district where at least one act of pilotage had been performed, or where a pilotage exemption certificate had been in force, between 1984 and 1987. However, the act provided a procedure by which other harbour authorities could be assigned CHA status and some harbours have taken advantage of this process. The Marine Navigation Act 2013 amended the Pilotage Act to provide a reverse process, so that harbour authorities could be relieved of CHA status.

BRRM is a water-based technique in which therapist-assisted strengthening and mobilizing exercises are performed while the patient lies horizontally in the water, with support provided by rings or floats around the neck, arms, pelvis, and legs.  Background  The Bad Ragaz Ring Method (BRRM), originally developed by physiotherapists in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland, is an aquatic therapy treatment approach that uses a water-based strengthening and mobilizing resistive exercise model. BRRM is based on proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). PNF is commonly used in physiotherapy to enhance both active and passive range of motion, with the ultimate goal being to improve neuromuscular function using patterns of movement and therapist- assisted resistance. Therapy is performed while floating horizontally in the water, with rings or floats supporting the neck, arms, pelvis, and knees. The extremities are used as levers to activate the trunk muscles.Dutton, M. 2011. Orthopaedics for the physical therapist assistant. Page 187 Bad Ragaz ring method.

The Bad Ragaz Ring Method. In: Becker, BE and Cole, AJ and (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. . Bad Ragaz Ring Method (BRRM) gets its name from the famous Bad Ragaz natural spring and wellness spa in eastern Switzerland. \\"Ring\\" refers to the rings or floats that are used to support the patient at the water surface. BRRM combines early techniques of aquatic exercise, developed in the 1930s by German physician Knupfer, with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques developed in the 1950s and 1960s by American neurophysiologist Herman Kabat and his assistants Margaret Knott and Dorothy Voss. Dr Knupfer originally adapted land exercises to water, using floats to support the patient while the therapist acts as a fixed point for movement. Knott and Voss applied PNF extensively for therapeutic exercise and began presenting their techniques in workshops in the 1950s; PNF courses began to be taught at major universities during the 1960s; and subsequently PNF became a widely accepted technique used extensively by physical therapists, other health professionals, and athletes.McAtee RE and Charland J. 2007. Facilitated stretching: PNF stretching and strengthening made easy, 3rd ed. (Chapter 2. Focus on facilitated stretching, pp 11-18). Human Kinetics. . Adaptation of PNF for use in aquatic therapy took place between the early 1960s and 1990 at Bad Ragaz, initially by Dr W.M. Zinn and Nele Ipsen, and later by Bridget Davies and Beatrice Egger.Ainslie, T. 2012. The concise guide to physiotherapy - 2-volume set: Assessment and Treatment. pp 1096-1106, Bad Ragaz Ring Method. Elsevier Health Sciences. .  Technique  BRRM involves an aquatic therapist working one-on-one to guide a patient through specific patterns of movement and resistance, with the effect of muscular elongation and relaxation and associated pain modulation, and with the goal of improving proprioception and neuromuscular functioning. The method uses various properties of water for therapy, in particular turbulence and resistance, to restore anatomical, biomechanical, and physiological movements of joints and muscles in functional patterns. As with land-based PNF, BRRM recruits weak muscles by overflow from strong muscles and stimulates sensory awareness to rehabilitate neuromuscular function. BRRM differs from land-based PNF in various technical details. In particular, on land the therapist moves around the patient and controls resistance; whereas in water, the therapist acts as a fixed point, while the patient controls resistance by varying the speed of movement. Neck, pelvis, arm, and leg rings or floats provide support and correct positioning as the patient lies supine in waist to shoulder-depth water. The therapist stands with hips and knees slightly flexed and guides the patient through specific exercises. Exercises are focused on increasing joint range of motion, increasing mobility of neural and myofascial tissues, and improving muscle function.  Applications  Therapeutic applications include orthopaedic and rheumatology conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, spondylosis, osteoarthritis, including pre- and postsurgery, fibromyalgia, and ankylosing spondylitis); post fracture (e.g., spine, pelvis and lower limb); soft tissue injuries; thoracic or breast surgery; and neurological conditions (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, spinal injury, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, head injury).

The song is notable for its playful use of Banglish. Reception The song received a mixed reaction in Bangladesh. It was widely criticized on the grounds that the lyrics and the subsequent music video in particular, did not adequately capture the essence of Bangladeshi culture and heritage. Despite this, the song became hugely popular in a short while due to its catchy tune and energetic beat. A competition held by the ICC, which invited university students from the three host cities (Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet) to create and submit their own dance videos, helped to further popularise the song. The competition gave rise to flashmobs and performances in a number of major cities in Bangladesh. Eventually, the trend continued in other cities and even spread abroad to New York City, London, China and Russia well after the deadline for the competition had passed.

This was the result of the efforts of environmentalist groups, and dovetailed with the construction of the MRT Red Line. The Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation footed the bill for the conversion. In February 2014, it came to light that city officials had privately come to an agreement with a charitable organization founded on behalf of a deceased lumber tycoon to pave over a wooded area at the northwest corner of Central Park and erect a public library bearing the name of said individual. A wide array of local citizens have arisen to oppose the proposed partial paving over of Central Park. Features Kaohsiung Literature Library Central Park includes Kaohsiung Literature Library, Scenic Lake, Middle Island, Speech Square, Water Square, Hedgerow Labyrinth and Outdoor Terrace. Water Square offers 20-minute-long \\"water dances\\" several times a day. Transportation The park is accessible from Central Park Station of Kaohsiung MRT.

In 2012, she curtailed her formal membership of the troupe to branch out on her own. Biography Born in Busan, Kim began to study ballet when she was 12, completing her training at the Bolshoi Ballet School in 1998. The same year she joined the Korean National Ballet where she soon gained the distinction of prima ballerina. Kim has contributed significantly to Korean ballet taking leading roles in Giselle, Swan Lake, Don Quixote and Jean-Christophe Maillot's Romeo and Juliet. Between 1998 and 2012, Kim performed approximately 100 times a year, practicing three or four different programs at a time. Semi-nude photos of her in Vogue and a photographer's exhibition in 2007 were considered controversial. Despite several offers from foreign troupes, she continued to dance with the company until 2012 when she branched out on her own, hoping to devote more of her time to musicals, pop art and fashion. After 15 years, she left the national ballet although she continues to dance with KNB as a guest principal dancer. Her first new assignment in June 2012 was to perform in Poise, a contemporary ballet production, followed in 2013 by her own production of Marguerite and Armand. In 2014, Kim will perform in ‚ÄúTwo in Two‚Äù, a collaboration with her rival from the KNB, Ji-Young Kim, which incorporates tango, flamenco, ballet and contemporary dance. The two principal ballerinas had shared the role of princess Nakrang in the KNB show \\"Prince Hodong\\" in 2011 at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, Italy. During 2016 Vivaldi‚Äôs Orlando finto pazzo production at the Korea National Opera, Kim did a cameo as princess Angelica. In that occasion she was asked by director Fabio Ceresa to dance a choreography in less than 1 square meter. Of her various awards, she has been the recipient of the Rookie award from the Korean Dance Association (2001), bronze medallist at the Moscow International Ballet Competition (2001), and Prima Ballerina Award of the Korean Dance Association (2002).

The typhoon did an estimated $1 billion in damage and killed thousands of people. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. A similar bill was sponsored in the United States Senate by Senator Mazie Hirono at the same time as this House version. The bill became law on March 25, 2014. Background Map of damaged houses by municipality showing track of storm, from the United Nations, as of November 18, 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, on November 8, 2013. It is the deadliest Philippine typhoon on record, killing at least 6,201 people in that country alone. Haiyan is also the strongest storm recorded at landfall, and unofficially the strongest typhoon ever recorded in terms of wind speed. As of January 2014, bodies were still being found. The cyclone caused catastrophic destruction in the Visayas, particularly on Samar and Leyte. According to UN officials, about 11 million people have been affected and many have been left homeless. The United States government gave the Philippines $52 million worth of aid and deployed the United States Marines, United States Navy and United States Air Force in order to assist with the humanitarian operations. This was seen by observers as part of the Asia pivot that the United States government had previously announced. The Philippine government had been discussing with the U.S. plans regarding the deployment of U.S. military troops within the country. Aid contributions of the U.S. was seen as a sign of goodwill in order to further strengthen relations. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act would treat cash contributions made after January 1, 2014, and before March 1, 2014, for the relief of victims in the Republic of the Philippines affected by Typhoon Haiyan as having been made on December 31, 2013, for purposes of the tax deduction for charitable contributions. The bill would deem such a contribution as meeting the recordkeeping requirements of the Internal Revenue Code if the taxpayer produces a telephone bill showing the name of the donee organization and the date and amount of the contribution. Procedural history The Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on December 12, 2013 by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D, CA-15). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means and the United States House Committee on the Budget. On March 20, 2014, The Hill reported that the bill was expected to be considered the following week under a suspension of the rules. The House voted to pass the bill with a voice vote on March 24, 2014. The United States Senate voted to pass the bill by unanimous consent on March 25, 2014, and it was signed into law later that day by President Barack Obama. Debate and discussion Rep. Swalwell argued in favor the bill, which he introduced, saying \\"Typhoon Haiyan devastated many parts of the Philippines and we should make it as easy as possible for Americans who want to assist those affected by the storm.\\" Swalwell saw the bill as providing \\"another incentive for Americans to donate and donate now - when their help is needed most.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Income tax in the United States *Acts of the 113th United States Congress Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3771 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3771 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3771 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3771 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3771 Category:United States federal taxation legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States federal income tax ","title":"Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act"},{"id":"42266853","text":"A US soldier guards German prisoners in Remagen Camp (Lager Remagen) The Golden Mile () was an Allied POW camp in 1945 on the fertile Rhine plain known as the Golden Mile near Remagen in Germany.  History  Towards the end of the Second World War, US troops established prisoner of war camps along the River Rhine for the detention of German soldiers. During the conquest of the Rhineland 250,000 German soldiers were captured and, following the destruction of the Ruhr Pocket, another 325,000 joined them. From mid-April 1945 around 660,000 Germans Overmans, a.a.O. p.260 were held in these camps. After the collapse of the Western Front, the Americans ‚Äì themselves suffering from supply shortages ‚Äì had to accommodate and care for German prisoners of war as well as two million of their own soldiers. The so-called Rheinwiesenlager (\\"Rhine Pasture Camps\\") were intended as transit camps, offering temporary accommodation for the prisoners. The Golden Mile was one of these camps.  The camp  The camp occupied the area between Remagen and Niederbreisig. On 8 May 1945 it was occupied by 253,000 prisoners. Built for the most part by the prisoners themselves, the camp was surrounded by barbed wire and divided into two separate areas: the first allocated to town of Remagen, the second to the town of Sinzig. Both camp areas were bounded on the east by the Rhine and on the west by the embankment of a railway line. Inside the camp, individual \\"cages\\", separated from one another by barbed wire, held the prisoners in groups of fifty, hundred or a thousand. The Golden Mile near Remagen. Above left: Dattenberg. Above centre: Leubsdorf. Right: Sinzig. Foreground: the River Ahr  Care and housing  The care and housing of prisoners was extremely poor. There were initially neither wooden huts or shelters nor appropriate washing and toilet facilities. Only a few prisoners were allowed to keep a strip of canvas or a coat. The rest were exposed to the hardships of the April weather, with its frequent rain. Some prisoners dug holes in the ground using their hands and primitive tools to seek shelter from the rain. Many died in the temporary dwellings or were buried alive when their burrows collapsed. There was an issue of food once a day. This was initially barely enough to survive. Only after weeks did food for the prisoners improve. Even the drinking water supply was a problem to begin with, and prisoners had to queue for hours to get a little, strongly chlorinated, Rhine water.  Closure of the camp and aftermath  On 11 July 1945, the camp was taken over by the French, who finally closed it on 20 July. Many of the prisoners were transferred to other camps or to France and some were not released until one or two years later. During the time that the camp was in existence, 1,247 inmates died of dysentery, undernourishment and exhaustion. In spite of this relatively low death rate of under 1%, many survivors returned from imprisonment traumatized by their experience.  Commemoration sites  Memorial in Sinzig Today, the prisoners are commemorated by the Black Madonna Chapel in Remagen, a monument in Sinzig, the war cemetery in Bad Bodendorf and an exhibition room in the Remagen Bridge Peace Museum.http://www.bruecke- remagen.de/ausstellung/5_de.htm  References   Literature   * *  Sources  * Wolfgang G√ºckelhorn: Das Ende am Rhein ‚Äì Kriegsende zwischen Remagen und Andernach, Aachen, 2005 * Karlheinz Grohs: Die schwarze Madonna von Remagen ‚Äì 1945: Kriegsgefangen am Rhein ‚Äì Gedenken und Erinnerung,Remagen, 1993  External links  *Kurt Kleemann: 'Geplanter Tod in der Goldenen Meile?

Background After training as a biologist in New Zealand at Auckland University College and Otago University, Trevarthen researched infancy at Harvard in 1967. Work Trevarthen has published on brain development, infant communication and emotional health. He believes that very young babies rapidly develop proto- cultural intelligence through interacting with other people, including in teasing fun play. For instance he has demonstrated that a newborn has an innate ability to initiate a dialogic relationship with an adult, and then build up this relationship through eye contact, smiling, and other holistic body functions rhythmically and cooperatively. He studied successful interactions between infants and their primary care givers, and found that the mother's responsiveness to her baby's initiatives supported and developed intersubjectivity (shared understanding), which he regarded as the basis of all effective communication, interaction and learning. He has applied intersubjectivity to the very rapid cultural development of new born infants. and used the term ‚Äòprimary intersubjectivity‚Äô to refer to early developing sensory-motor processes of interaction between infants and caregivers.Trevarthen, C. B. 1979. Communication and cooperation in early infancy: A description of primary intersubjectivity. In M. Bullowa (ed.), Before Speech. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press He believes babies are looking for companionship (including the sense of fun and playfulness), engagement and relationship (rather than using the term attachment), and that companions can include mothers, fathers, other adults, peers and siblings; he has said \\"I think the ideal companion ‚Äì and it can be a practitioner or not ‚Äì is a familiar person who really treats the baby with playful human respect.\\" In later years his work has focused on the musicality of babies, including its use in communication. He is a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. Video interaction guidance In the 1980s Harry Biemans, in the Netherlands, applied Trevarthen's research using video clips and created video interaction guidance (VIG), which is used for instance with mothers and young babies in attachment-based therapy. Quote Stephen Seligman said Trevarthen \\"has distinguished himself for more than four decades as one of the most inventive and rigorous explorers of infant development and its implications. Among the infant research cognoscenti, he ranks... in breaking misleading assumptions of the varied disciplines to see what mothers and babies really do.\\"Seligman, 2009, \\"Anchoring intersubjective models...\\" Psychoanalytical Dialogues 19, p504, quoted in Video Interaction Guidance, Kennedy.

Innocenzio enrolled to obtain a classical education at the College of Florence. However, he inclined towards painting and the arts. In Florence, he briefly worked with Father Alberigo de Vellano, a priest who had trained with Ottaviano Dandini and Sebastiano Conca. Patronage with various ecclesiastical and diplomatic figures allowed him to trave through Italy. In 1772, he traveled to Rome, where he became a follower of Anton Raphael Mengs.

Provisions Clauses 1 to 7 aimed to curtail faggot voters by requiring a rentcharge property qualification for the franchise to be either over ten pounds or else held for over one year prior to the election. This restricted temporary conveyancing of parts of a freehold from its true owner to multiple fictitious owners. These provisions were an uncontentious technical amendment of an act passed in 1745 (19 George II c.11). The oath required of electors under the 1745 act was amended by clause 5 of the Newtown Act to reflect the changed property restrictions. The revised oath restated unchanged the portion which prohibited Irish Roman Catholics from voting: :I am not a Papist, or married to a Papist, nor do I educate, or suffer to be educated, any of my children under the age of fourteen years in the popish religion. Clause 8 was controversially appended to the bill at a late stage. It explicitly permitted non-residents to become burgesses (members of the corporation). Burgesses were the sole parliamentary electors in corporation boroughs, and in freeman boroughs they were also crucial since they had the power to grant or refuse freeman status. The patrons of pocket boroughs ensured the burgesses were loyal placemen. Permitting non-resident burgesses was necessary as only members of the established Church of Ireland could be burgesses, and many boroughs were rotten boroughs or otherwise underdeveloped places where few Protestants were willing to settle. This provision was stated to apply to boroughs other than those with city status. The 1835 Report of the Commissioners on Municipal Corporations in Ireland questioned whether it was applicable in the case of Armagh and Tuam, both being episcopal sees and hence \\"cities\\" in William Blackstone's definition in Commentaries on the Laws of England. In fact, non-residents had served on both corporations.Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl p.671‚Äì2 \\"City of Armagh\\" ¬ß10Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl p.432 \\"Borough of Tuam\\" ¬ß13 Enactment The act's common name comes from Newtownards in County Down, where the Newtownards constituency was the subject of litigation between Brabazon Ponsonby, 1st Earl of Bessborough and Alexander Stewart. In 1744 Stewart bought from Bessborough's unstable stepson Robert Colvill the manor of Newtown (later renaming its seat Mount Stewart). Bessborough had been managing the borough within the manor for Colvill, and Stewart set about replacing Bessborough's appointees on its corporation, giving him control of its two MPs. Bessborough launched a court case in 1747, arguing that Stewart's burgesses were ineligible as they were not resident in the borough. This action prompted the addition of clause 8 to the bill. The heads of the bill were reported by the Committee of the Whole House of Commons on 17 December 1747. The heads were then sent for pre-approval, as required by Poynings' Law, to the Privy Council of Ireland in January 1748 and then the Privy Council of Great Britain in March 1748, both of which debated it strongly and made amendments. Petitions were considered from Stewart and from The Irish Society. The amended bill was returned to the Commons on 28 March and sent to the Irish House of Lords on 31 March. Historical opinion The act's negative reputation is ascribed by A. P. W. Malcomson to James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont, who called it \\"the most outrageous and unconstitutional that ever was enacted\\" in his 1783 memoirs, which present clause 8 as instigated by Stewart solely to win his court case. William Lynch in 1831 was also critical, stating that all ancient boroughs in Ireland were de jure potwallopers, under the common law as \\"enforced by the statutes of 10th Hen. VII. ch. 7,\\"An Act that none be admitted Alderman, Juror, or Freeman in no Town, but if he have been Prentice or Inhabitant in the same.\\" Statutes at Large v.1 pp.46‚Äì47 and 33rd Hen. VIII\\";33 Hen. 8. Sess. 2. c. 1 \\"An Act for the Adjournment of the Parliament and the Place to hold the same, and what Persons shall be chosen Knights and Burgesses.\\" Statutes at Large v.1 pp.205‚Äì207 in this view the 1748 act was one of a series of encroachments on an ancient right. Malcomson argues that Charlemont's account is coloured by political bias and that clause 8 was \\"only simplifying and making more intelligible the legal position as it already stood\\". Malcomson accepts the court case as the motivation for clause 8, but suggests that MPs were not acting in Stewart's particular interest but from \\"dread and uncertainty\\" of a decision's effect on their own constituency. Stewart's case was decided in his favour in 1758, without reference to the Newtown Act. Malcomson suggests the act did not apply to the case as clause 8 was not retroactive, and that the clause's only effect was between 1748 and 1758, during which time it forestalled any copycat cases being started. The allowance of non-resident burgesses has been presented as a worsening of the Irish House of Commons' unrepresentativeness, and as intended solely to increase the hold of patrons over their boroughs. Malcomson disputes this, suggesting the patron's hold was tight in any case: \\"what was wrong with the burgesses ... was not that they were non-resident but that there were too few of them\\". Malcomson posits disadvantages of restricting the franchise to residents, including the exclusion of progressive gentry living near but outside the borough, and the difficulty of determining a prospective voter's residency in cases where a borough's boundaries were irregular or uncertain. The act's guarantee of the franchise to non-residents resulted in a transfer of power from the local gentry and bourgeois to the larger regional landholders. The latter were interested mainly in controlling the borough's MPs, and not in its municipal affairs, causing an \\"ossification\\" in town government that lasted until the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840.Johnston-Liik 2006, p.202 Amendment and repeal The Catholic Relief Act 1793 implicitly amended the Newtown Act, permitting Catholics to vote and specifying a different electoral oath. Clauses (sections) 1‚Äì7 of the Newtown Act were repealed by an act of 1795 (35 George III c.29). The Acts of Union 1800 disenfranchised most Irish boroughs, and the corporations of many of these became defunct; clause 8 of the Newtown Act continued to apply to the remainder. In 1826, Sir John Newport tried unsuccessfully to introduced a bill to repeal clause 8. The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 abolished most corporations and reformed the remainder. This rendered the Newtown Act obsolete. Section 8 was repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878. The entire act (only the title and preamble remained) was not formally repealed in the Republic of Ireland until the Statute Law Revision Act 2007.

Jonas' sons were Leon C., Huntley N. and Rolland H., of whom Huntley N. and Rolland H. would serve as governors of New Hampshire. Geography North Rochester is located in the northern corner of the city of Rochester. The Salmon Falls River, which forms the border between New Hampshire and Maine, runs along the eastern edge of the community. The town of Milton, New Hampshire, is directly to the north. New Hampshire Route 125 (Milton Road) runs through the center of North Rochester, leading north to the center of Milton and south to downtown Rochester. The Spaulding Turnpike (New Hampshire Route 16) runs along a hillside on the western edge of the community.

At the time of Jonas' investigation the rippling water of the Salmon Falls River at the Cottles mill site was a feature on a pleasant day's buggy ride that followed a loop. Ruth HowlandRuth Howland, \\"Great New Industry ‚ÄìRochester History\\". Article provided to J. M. Snyder by Rochester Historical Society; Martha Fowler Letter January 31, 2007 reported that the buggy ride would begin in Rochester with a drive up the Milton Road to North Rochester then a cross over the Salmon Falls River was made into Maine. The rippling water at the Cottles Mill site would be viewed on this crossing. The loop would then continue on the Maine side of the Salmon Falls River to East Rochester, there crossing the river to return to Rochester. Jonas decided this would be a good site and started construction on a second leatherboard mill on the Salmon Falls River. The first phase of the project was the construction of a canal with masonry walls. The canal ran and was wide. The masonry walls were thick. The next phase of construction was building a solid masonry mass square where the mill wheel was placed (see photo). Next, a dam was built on the Salmon Falls River that was long from abutment to abutment. The dam created Spaulding Pond on the river, which extends north for a mile into Milton. The factory building constructed for the mill measured and was four stories high (see postcard photo). Mammoth timbers were used in finishing this solidly constructed mill. When the North Rochester mill started up it, like Milton, would have a Leatherboard capacity of about 7 tons a day. In 1900, before the North Rochester leatherboard mill was completed, Jonas Spaulding died. Leon C. Spaulding became President of J. Spaulding & Sons Company. With the completion of the mill in North Rochester the Spaulding brothers acquired and started several auxiliary businesses to use and convert the company's leatherboard. In 1900 after the startup of the North Rochester mill, the brothers added to the plant special machinery that was designed to produce shoe counters. In 1898 Spaulding Brothers Company had been assigned US Patent 606,375 for Counter-Cutting Machine from Daniel L. Chandler of Ayer, Massachusetts. In 1902 the brothers acquired Kennebunk Manufacturing Co in Kennebunk, Maine, which company had been making fiberboard lunch boxes since 1898. Later Kennebunk would manufacture violin cases and radio speaker horns. Also in 1902 the Spaulding brothers started a subsidiary, Spaulding Perkins, which manufactured fiberboard receptacles. Spaulding Perkins was the nucleus of Spaulding's material handling division which survives today as Bayhead Products Company. Also in 1902 Leon, Huntley, and Rolland Spaulding (Jonas' sons) brought the Spaulding Brothers (Jonas & Waldo) operations in Townsend Harbor, Massachusetts, under the banner of J. Spaulding & Sons Company. In 1906 the brothers purchased a cutdown machine that could be used to produce products made of multiple plies of fibreboard. It was installed in the North Rochester plant. From this purchase the vulcanized fibre operation in Tonawanda, New York, would develop. Bronze plaque on masonry that enclosed mill wheel at J Spaulding & Sons Company Mill in North Rochester The company name changed to Spaulding Fibre Company in 1924. The first of the three Spaulding brothers to die was Leon, in East Sebago, Maine, on September 11, 1924Inscription Spaulding Mausoleum on the Rockcraft Lodge Estate grounds in East Sebago, ME. while overseeing an expansion of the Tonawanda plant that included the addition of a continuous vulcanized fibre- making line. Leon split his time while he personally managed the plant in Tonawanda between the Statler Hotel in Buffalo, New York, and his summer estate in East Sebago. Leon had fallen ill with heart problems five months before his death. On March 14, 1942, Rolland died at the Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester, an institution that benefited from the philanthropy of the Spaulding family.Florence H.

Historical Society of the Tonawandas When the mill was rebuilt it was designed to make transformer insulation board. At the time of its reopening it was hailed as the most modern fibreboard plant in the world. The plant in North Rochester served as the center for the Spaulding Brothers, and the company's corporate offices remained in Rochester until after Huntley's death on November 11, 1955, after which they were relocated to Tonawanda in 1960. After Huntley's death, Spaulding Fibre Company became part of a charitable trust that Huntley and his only sister Marion S. Potter had set up to disperse their remaining wealth within 15 years of the last to die. Marion S. Potter followed her brother in death on September 27, 1957.

The dominant language of the album's lyrics is Italian. The album, with its lyrical and classical elements, was characterized as reflecting a radical change in Yanni's style. Despite the album's use of opera singers, Yanni emphasized the album was \\"not opera.\\" Yanni collaborated with tenor Pl√°cido Domingo and producer Ric Wake to match Yanni‚Äôs songs to the respective vocalists. In part because of the distinguished vocalists' schedules, the project is said to have required four years to complete.

A U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction requiring the state to recognize the marriages of the plaintiffs, three same-sex couples. The court found the equal protection analysis used in Bourke v. Beshear, a case dealing with a comparable Kentucky statute \\"especially persuasive.\\"Tanco, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 769. On April 25, 2014, that injunction was stayed by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Tanco was appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which reversed the district court and upheld Tennessee's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions on November 6. On January 16, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court consolidated this case with three others and agreed to review the case. Oral arguments were heard on April 28, 2015. District court proceedings On October 21, 2013, local attorneys supported by the National Center for Lesbian Rights filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on behalf of four Tennessee same-sex couples seeking to require Tennessee to recognize their marriages. They argued that the state's policy constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and violates their rights to due process and equal protection, as well as their right to travel. One of the couples married in California in 2008 and the other three married in New York in 2011. They contended that Tennessee's refusal to recognize their marriages was a unique departure from its rule that \\"a marriage valid where celebrated is valid everywhere\\". The suit named as defendants Governor Bill Haslam and 3 other state officials.Complaint, One of the couples married in New York left the case and the number of defendants was reduced by one. =Preliminary injunction granted= On March 14, 2014, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger granted a preliminary injunction requiring the state to recognize the marriages of the three plaintiff couples. She wrote: \\"At this point, all signs indicate that, in the eyes of the United States Constitution, the plaintiffs' marriages will be placed on an equal footing with those of heterosexual couples and that proscriptions against same-sex marriage will soon become a footnote in the annals of American history.\\"Tanco, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 772. =Stay denied= The state immediately filed a motion to stay this ruling, but on March 20, Judge Trauger denied the request, reasoning that unlike the stay ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court in Kitchen v. Herbert \\"the court's order does not open the floodgates for same-sex couples to marry in Tennessee ... [and] applies only to the three same-sex couples at issue in this case.\\" The Tennessee Attorney General filed an interlocutory appeal in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, asking the circuit court to stay the injunction that forces the state to recognize plaintiffs' marriages. The attorney general cited the stay granted by the U.S. Supreme Court in January in another same- sex marriage case, Kitchen v. Herbert. Court of Appeals proceedings On April 25, 2014, the Sixth Circuit, in an unpublished per curiam order, issued a stay of the district court's decision in Tanco, and ordered that the case be assigned to a panel of judges on the Sixth Circuit for expedited consideration on the merits. The effect of this order is to stay the preliminary injunction awarded to plaintiffs by the district court, meaning that the state of Tennessee will no longer have to recognize the legally consummated same-sex marriages of the six named plaintiffs in the Tanco case until after the appeal is decided. The Sixth Circuit said that its decision to stay the order is based on the \\"unsettled\\" nature of the law, as well as the public interest and the interests of the parties. The Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments on August 6. On November 6, the Sixth Circuit ruled 2‚Äì1 that Tennessee's ban on same-sex marriage does not violate the constitution. It said it was bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1972 action in a similar case, Baker v. Nelson, which dismissed a same-sex couple's marriage claim \\"for want of a substantial federal question.\\" Writing for the majority, Judge Jeffrey Sutton also dismissed the arguments made on behalf of same-sex couples in this case: \\"Not one of the plaintiffs' theories, however, makes the case for constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place it has been since the founding: in the hands of state voters.\\" Dissenting, Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey wrote: \\"Because the correct result is so obvious, one is tempted to speculate that the majority has purposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split regarding the legality of same-sex marriage that could prompt a grant of certiorari by the Supreme Court and an end to the uncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threatens.\\" Supreme Court proceedings On November 14, the same-sex couples filed an application for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. They asked the court to consider whether the U.S. Constitution protects a \\"fundamental right to marry\\", whether Tennessee's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions unlawfully restricts their right to travel, and whether the Supreme Court's dismissal of Baker v. Nelson (1972) is binding precedent in this case. Tennessee officials filed a brief in opposition to the plaintiffs' petition on December 15. On January 16, 2015, the United States Supreme Court consolidated this case with three others and agreed to review the case. It set a briefing schedule to be completed April 17. The court asked the parties to address two questions: \\"1) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex? 2) Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?\\" The plaintiff-petitioners told the court that Douglas Hallward-Driemeier of the law firm of Ropes & Gray would represent them at oral argument. On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case, which had been consolidated with three other cases from Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky, in Obergefell v. Hodges. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, the Supreme Court held that state bans on same-sex marriage are a violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf This ruling extended the right to same-sex marriage to the entire United States and required that states recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states. The ruling continued Justice Anthony Kennedy's legacy as a top jurist for gay rights in America, having now written four high court opinion favoring gays and lesbians; June 26, 2015 was the 2-year anniversary of the decision in United States v. Windsor, which overturned part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, and the 12th anniversary of the decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which overturned anti-sodomy laws in the United States. Kennedy issued his first major gay rights decision in 1996 in Romer v. Evans.

Elsa is the daughter of Mercedes Castillo de N√∫√±ez and Ram√≥n Antonio N√∫√±ez. Her mother was a high school teacher, and her father served as a general in the Dominican military. Elsa's parents had 12 children and raised them in a strict Catholic environment during the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship. \\"During her years in college, where she studied philosophy, Nu√±ez joined student-led political movements while, during the military intervention, her brother was killed. Nu√±ez‚Äôs work has run the gamut of artistic styles, from expressionism to abstraction, but the underlying themes remain constant. Sometimes Nu√±ez turns outward, toward the social conditions of everyday workers in the Dominican Republic or pays tribute to the women who toppled the Trujillo dictatorship. The acrylic painter also envisions female figures and their turbulent inner minds.\\" Education N√∫√±ez studied at Colegio Mar√≠a Auxiliadora, which was led by Salesian nuns, and in 1955, the Salesian sisters urged N√∫√±ez's father to enroll her in the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. N√∫√±ez's artistic gifts influenced the school's director and reputed painter Gilberto Hern√°ndez Ortega (1924‚Äì1979) to enroll young Elsa in the academy. N√∫√±ez graduated from Instituto de se√±oritas Salom√© Ure√±a in 1961 with her high school diploma. She studied art at the National School of Fine Arts, graduating in 1962 as a drawing teacher. She attended Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo, where she graduated with a degree in Philosophy. In 1970, she moved overseas to Madrid, Spain, where she completed a post-graduate at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. Career N√∫√±ez's first solo exhibition appeared in 1963 and received warm praise from local critics. That same year, she joined the Grupo Los Tres (1963‚Äì1965) with artists C√°ndido Bid√≥ (1938‚Äì2011) and Lepe (Leopoldo P√©rez, 1937), a collective that paid tribute to Grupo Los Cuatro, which had been formed years before by her professors Colson, Gausachs, Hern√°ndez Ortega, and Clara Ledesma (1924‚Äì1999). \\"Her early work starting in the first decade of her professional career is characterized by powerful subjects that evoke the human condition, the nature of being, life‚Äôs fragility, death, social contrasts, poverty, despair, abuse of power, and the dark outlook of her generation.\\" While living in Madrid for her postgraduate studies during the 1970s, she modeled for photographer Cristina Garc√≠a Rodero and met her husband, Dominican painter, actor and filmmaker, Angel Hach√©. They married in 1973. N√∫√±ez taught painting and drawing at the National School of Fine Arts, Colegio Dominicano de la Salle, la Universidad APEC. Along with her husband, Angel Hach√©, she directed the Children's Creativity Workshops at the Casa de Teatro, Museo de Arte Moderno y Muse de las Casas Reales. In 1979 she was awarded a scholarship with her husband by UNESCO to visit Children's Creativity Workshops throughout Spain and France, to study the methods of cultural activities that apply in those countries. \\"Her experiences during the 1970s were reflected in her work through the incorporation of the white color, a reduction of black tones, greater attention to landscapes, musical references, tropical flora and fauna, and painterly qualities reminiscent of the Romantics.\\" During the 1980s, Elsa's work expanded \\"its chromatic richness with an emphasis on shades of blue and earth colors, as well as in the textures that shift between realism and abstraction.\\" Her work appeared in 'Homenaje a Vivaldi' (1980), 'Paisajes y figuras' (1984), 'Canto a la primavera' (1984), 'Mi tierra desde su centro' (1985), and 'Exaltaci√≥n de la mariposa' (1987). N√∫√±ez illustrated the novel Mutanville by Dominican author Arturo Rodr√≠guez Fern√°ndez (1948‚Äì2010) in 1980 and the poetry volume Viacrucis by the esteemed Dominican bard M√°ximo Avil√©s Blonda (1931‚Äì1988) in 1983. During the 1990s, N√∫√±ez intensified \\"her scrutiny of the land as a nurturing mother, the expressive possibilities and meaning of matter and color, increasing the symbolism of her work.\\" She was a contributor to 'Homenaje a las Hermanas Mirabal' (1997), a public art project that was painted on the obelisk located on the seafront road along the coastline of the city of Santo Domingo. From 1996-1998, Nunez served as president of the Colegio Dominican de Artistas Pl√°sticos (CODAP). Mar√≠a Elena Ditr√©n, Director Museum of Modern Art, described Elsa Nu√±ez's work as a reflection of the turbulent '60s, which were characterized by fear, anxiety and terror of the Trujillo dictatorship and the Revolution of April 1965.

It was his first album without songs that were previously recorded by other artists. The title track is one of the album's four ballads that, along with four of the remaining six up-tempo tracks, delve into the subject of relationships, but it is the synth- driven \\"Step by Step\\" and the anthemic \\"Hold On\\" on which Mathis take a break from the usual focus on love songs. The former offers the hope that can be found in change that comes gradually until \\"I can see the way free from yesterday to a new beginning\\". The latter stresses the importance of being oneself: \\"Life is a party. Why don't you come the way you are?\\" Even though the title track was used on the ABC soap opera Ryan's Hope,. the album did not make it onto Billboard magazine's Top Pop Albums chart. The song \\"Right from the Heart\\" did reach number 38 during its two weeks on the magazine's list of the 40 Hot Adult Contemporary songs of the week in the US in May that year.. Ryan's Hope cameos In 1985, Mathis guest starred on the daytime drama Ryan's Hope in the April 9 and May 1 episodes, the latter of which included a performance of the song \\"Right from the Heart\\". In the plot of the show, Dave Greenberg (Scott Holmes) has written the song, and Katie Ryan Thompson (Julia Campbell) \\"takes the song to Mathis in the hope he'll record it\\". Mathis lip syncs to his recording of the song as he pretends to be recording the song in a recording studio while the characters look on from the control room. Reception People magazine gave the album a mixed review, noting the up- tempo songs, \\"such as \\"Touch by Touch\\", on which Mathis forces it a little\\". Lamenting the lack of duets, the reviewer wrote that \\"he has had such success doing them\\", and this is his first studio album since 1977 that has not included one. The reviewer does praise the title track as \\"vintage Mathis\\" and asserts that \\"there's still nobody better when it comes to creating a warm, relaxed, mellow mood\\".

In his career as a detective between 1923 and 1947, Broderick built a reputation for physical courage, for assaulting gangsters like Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond and \\"Two-Gun\\" Crowley, and for facing down armed gunmen in a prison break at The Tombs prison. Broderick was a \\"celebrity detective\\" whose exploits were a favorite of gossip columnists and the press. He and his sometime partner Johnny Cordes were probably the best known officers in the NYPD in the era between the two world wars. A character based on Broderick was the subject of the 1936 film Bullets or Ballots, with the Broderick character played by Edward G. Robinson. He was also portrayed in a comic book about police, and a film, TV series, and Broadway musical based on his life were once contemplated. Broderick won eight medals for valor during his career, but he was dogged by accusations of excessive force. The Industrial Squad under his command was accused of corruption and brutality toward strikers, with Broderick himself accused of taking bribes, and he once beat a prisoner in his custody so badly that he was permanently crippled. He would sometimes beat up innocent people, and brutality complaints against him were futile. He was finally forced into retirement by Mayor William O'Dwyer for associating with gangsters. Early life John Joseph Broderick was born on Manhattan's East 25th Street, in the impoverished Gashouse District, the son of Margaret Kendall and Michael Broderick. At the age of 12 he left parochial school to drive a brick truck, and then a coal truck, to support his mother after the death of his father. He served in the U.S. Navy in World War I and worked as a bodyguard for Samuel Gompers, the labor leader. He joined the New York City Fire Department in April 1922, but found that boring. Having taken both the Fire and Police Department examinations, in January of the following year he joined the New York City Police Department. In their 2001 book NYPD, James Lardner and Thomas A. Reppetto describe Broderick as a \\"Gashouse district tough guy\\" and \\"former labor slugger.\\" Career Times Square in 1943, when Johnny Broderick patrolled the area. Broderick joined the NYPD on January 16, 1923, and he became a detective third grade on April 2 of that year, obtaining in less than four months a promotion that would usually take five years. The New York Herald Tribune called his swift appointment as detective \\"extraordinary luck or influence or both.\\" He continued to rise rapidly in rank. He was promoted to detective second grade in May 1925 and detective first grade in March 1926. The Daily News reported years later that \\"no few of Detective Broderick's contemporaries [felt] that he plainly had an angel somewhere in the city.\\" In 1934 it was reported that before joining the police department he was a chauffeur for a coal merchant who was close to chief inspector William J. Lahey, who was believed to be Broderick's sponsor in the department. Broderick was put in charge of the Industrial Squad, a plainclothes unit was created in 1917 to monitor the labor movement, to keep it free from political radicals, Communists and racketeers, and to suppress violence during strikes. Broderick \\"had little patience with labor militants,\\" according to one history of the NYPD in that era, and he led the Industrial Squad in violent confrontations with the fur workers' union, which was led by Communists, and railroad workers insurgents in 1926 and 1927. Strikes in the city's Garment District also turned violent, and in August 1925 Broderick's nose was broken when he tried to disperse a crowd of striking garment workers. In November 1926 the Gangster Squad was absorbed by the Industrial Squad, with Broderick in command. While commander of the Industrial Squad, Broderick received acclaim for his role in quelling an attempted prison break at The Tombs, the Manhattan prison, on November 3, 1926. He faced down two armed convicts, one of them mobster Hyman Amberg, in the Tombs yard after they had already killed two prison officials. Police said that the convicts, who were already wounded, committed suicide as Broderick approached. He remained in charge of the Gangster and Industrial Squad until 1928, when he received what The New York Times described as \\"lesser assignments.\\" After Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor in 1934, Broderick and other police officers fell out of favor for connections with the Democratic Tammany Hall political machine. In 1934, by then assigned to the Manhattan District Attorney's office, he was reduced in rank to patrolman, his pay was cut by $1000 and he was transferred to Long Island City by police commissioner John F. O'Ryan. Syndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler said at the time that Broderick \\"has been busted and sent out to walk a beat because he has enjoyed for some years the endorsement and assistance of some of the most pernicious Tammany politicians in the city. He was reinstated as detective third grade by O'Ryan five months later after meeting with Broderick, saying that the original demotion was a result of \\"vague criticism regarding their political connections,\\" and that he was viewed by his current commander as a \\"model cop.\\" He was promoted to detective second grade in 1935 and detective first grade in 1939. On the Broadway beat, Broderick swiftly gained a reputation for violence. His fists were once described as \\"huge lethal pistons that could beat a man senseless in half a heartbeat,\\" and to \\"broderick\\" became Broadway slang for being knocked out by a single punch. His knuckles were broken many times. Once he knocked out the gangster Francis \\"Two Gun\\" Crowley with a single punch, even though Crowley was pointing a gun at him. At the time Crowley was captured by police in May 1931, Broderick attempted to break into the apartment where he was barricaded. He failed, and had to be hospitalized. He was said to have demanded that hoodlums tip their hat to him, and once was said to have gone to the funeral of a member of the Hudson Dusters gang and spat in his eye. Broderick would wrap a lead pipe in a newspaper, which allowed him to beat gangsters while it looked like he was giving them a friendly swat with a rolled-up newspaper. Broderick's exploits were widely reported in the New York media, gaining him celebrity status. His tenth anniversary on the police department was commemorated by a dinner in his honor in January 1933 at the Della Robbia room of the Vanderbilt Hotel, attended by politicians and civic leaders including Tammany Hall district leader James J. Hines. Entertainment was provided, gratis, by Bill Robinson, Bert Lahr and Harry Richman. Hines was subsequently convicted of racketeering for protecting Harlem numbers rackets run by Dutch Schultz. Broderick's exploits were a mainstay of the New York newspapers. He tossed hoodlums who had been bothering women through a plate-glass window, one by one, and then arrested them for malicious destruction of property, for which they were sentenced to 30 days in jail. He also disarmed a man who was robbing a crowded restaurant at Columbus Circle with two guns and a knife. He once reputedly responded to a threat from gangster Legs Diamond by emptying a trash bin over his head, and forced him to crawl away. Other accounts of the confrontation hold that Broderick dumped Diamond in the trash bin head-first, while others say that Broderick knocked out Diamond with a single blow, with one account claiming that Diamond was left unconscious for 20 minutes. Broderick's reputation for toughness was such that Jack Dempsey, the heavyweight boxing champion, once said of Broderick that \\"He's the only I wouldn't want to meet in a fight outside the ring and its rules.\\" He would offer himself as an informal protection service for crime victims, especially young women, and personally beat up offenders. Broderick worked often with Johnny Cordes, a two-time winner of the department's medal of honor, and Barney Ruditsky, whose exploits inspired the 1959 TV series The Lawless Years. Broderick was often selected as a bodyguard for visiting celebrities. President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested that Broderick be his special bodyguard when he visited New York for the 1936 World Series, and he also was bodyguard for Queen Marie of Romania and King Albert of Belgium. Allegations of misconduct Throughout his career, beginning with his days in the Industrial Squad, Broderick was a subject of allegations of misconduct, and the Industrial Squad under his command was accused of violence toward strikers and corruption. He sometimes beat up people who were totally innocent, and lawsuits and complaints of brutality were futile because of his public image, honed by favorable media coverage, and connections. Reporting on Broderick's brief demotion to patrolman in 1934, columnist Westbrook Pegler said that the demotion would do him some good, that he \\"was excessively tough at times and there were occasions when, pining for action, he bounced around people who were in not particular need of bouncing around.\\" Pegler said that Broderick was selective in whom he would harass, that \\"there were many low characters in the city, notorious for their activity in the rackets, who were walking right past Detective Broderick on the street and in the lobby of [Madison Square] Garden, whom he did not find any occasion to bounce around.\\" Pegler said he found that \\"strange.\\" Fiorello LaGuardia accused the Industrial Squad of extorting payoffs from labor and management In July 1926, Broderick and the Industrial Squad were accused by the American Civil Liberties Union of clubbing and beating striking Interborough Rapid Transit Company workers, injuring 20. Broderick denied the charges, saying the police were acting in self-defense. The squad was accused by the Teamsters Union of beating striking drivers, and it was accused of brutality against striking paper-box makers in 1926. The following year, Broderick's squad was accused of attacking fur industry strikers. In 1928, Broderick and officers from his squad were accused of beating two spectators at a Madison Square Garden bicycle race, sending them to the hospital with broken jaws and internal injuries. In this incident Broderick's career was rescued by favorable press coverage. In 1927, a furriers union official, Isidor Shapiro, told a special committee of the American Federation of Labor that his union paid the police $3800 a week in bribes for protection during a 1926 strike. Union officials claimed that non- union workers were beaten while police officers \\"stood idly by.\\" Shapiro claimed that the \\"Industrial Squad chief\\" was paid $100 a week and that ten men in the squad were paid $50 a week. Broderick and the other officers were cleared after an inquiry by a judge. The charges were revived in 1939, when a former Communist, Maurice L. Malkin, accused Broderick and other officers of corruption in testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Malkin testified that the furriers union, which was controlled by Communists in the 1920s, borrowed $1.75 million from racketeer Arnold Rothstein to finance the 1926 strike, and that $110,000 of that went to Broderick and other members of the Industrial Squad, including Barney Ruditsky. The amount that Broderick received was said to be $45,000 and $50,000. No action was taken against Broderick or the other detectives. As a mayoral candidate in 1929, Fiorello LaGuardia accused the Industrial Squad of extorting payoffs from labor and management, and that \\"instead of preserving order, this agency has done more to create disorder than anything else.\\" The squad was disbanded in 1933. In 1937, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court freed a prisoner who had been arrested for parole violation and beaten by Broderick, saying that \\"the police of the City of New York beat him so badly that he will be a cripple for life. I think this man has more than expiated his crime.\\" The prisoner sustained fractures to the knee and ribs, his jaw was dislocated, and he was not given medical attention while in police custody. Broderick's superiors found no reason to discipline the detective. Retirement controversy In September 1946, Broderick was assigned to the office of Mayor William O'Dwyer in an unannounced confidential capacity, a move that many in city government found surprising. After a few months he was abruptly transferred to the Main Office Division, and in July 1947, he retired from the police department. In 1949, he sought to become a Democratic leader in the Broadway district on Manhattan's west side. One of the two incumbent district leaders Broderick was challenging, Gerald V. Murphy, accused him of having been forced out of the department for associating with gangsters. The charge was confirmed by Manhattan's District Attorney, Frank Hogan, who disclosed that Broderick was forced to retire by Mayor William O'Dwyer after Hogan's office learned that in November 1946 he had accompanied a gambler and ex- convict, Ben Kaye, to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he \\"associated with\\" mobster Owney Madden. Broderick denied the charge, conceding that he was on the same plane as Kaye but that it was a \\"coincidence.\\" He admitted that he knew Madden and \\"every gangster in New York. That was my job.\\" His bid to become a district leader failed in the September 1949 primary elections. In an editorial, the New York Herald Tribune pointed out that the circumstances of Broderick's forced retirement only came to light because he was seeking a new career in politics, and that \\"voters may wonder how much they are really told about city government, when the Broderick incident demonstrates how discreetly a little embarrassment can be obliterated.\\" Personal life In 1931 Broderick was 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighed 170 pounds, and \\"dresses like Beau Brummel.\\" He neither smoked nor drank, worked out at a gymnasium every day, and kept in top physical condition. At the time of his demotion in 1934 he was described as having an affluent lifestyle. Though drawing a salary of $4,000 a year, cut to $3,000 as a result of the demotion, he drove a Cadillac, dressed expensively and owned a home in Jackson Heights, Queens. Broderick was a devoted prizefighting fan, rarely missing a fight at Madison Square Garden. During his days as a detective, Broderick enjoyed listening to his wife play the piano and was described by his New York Times obituary as fond of \\"monogrammed, cream-colored silk underwear\\" and that off-duty he was \\"the gentlest of men.\\" He was said to be upset by his portrayal by Robinson in Bullets or Ballots because Robinson was shown drinking and smoking. After his retirement he sold his life story to RKO Pictures for $75,000, to be made into a motion picture titled \\"Broadway's One-Man Riot Squad.\\" A 1948 report said that the screenplay was to be by Herman J. Mankiewicz, who knew Broderick from his days as a newspaper reporter. The film, which was to star Robert Ryan, was never made, and plans to have a television series or musical made about his life persisted through 1959, but did not come to pass. He died of heart disease on his birthday at his farmhouse outside Middletown, New York, where he raised horses and dogs. He was survived by his wife, the former Marion McShea, his daughter, Marion Farinon, three sisters and nine grandchildren. He was buried in Pine Lawn Cemetery in Massapequa, Long Island. In 1933 it was reported that he had been married for 14 years at the time, and that he had two daughters, Margaret and Marion. Legacy The brutal methods used by Broderick and other officers were sanctioned by the police department during their era, and praised as \\"fearless.\\" Beginning in the 1960s, however, New York police sought to curb that kind of conduct. Training programs were established teaching officers to observe the civil rights of suspects and the public. By the 1980s, it was feared that the pendulum had shifted back toward brutality, as complaints of assaults by police climbed. Broderick was cited by The New York Times in 1985 as an exemplar of the old methods of policing. At the time of his death in 1966, Walter Henning, an assistant chief inspector and a colleague of Broderick's, called him a \\"man of his time,\\" and said that \\"under restrictions today, he'd have a difficult time doing the things he did.\\" But during Prohibition, he said, \\"when these people [gangsters] went in and out of court it was like a revolving door, they had rather be locked up than to meet Johnny.\\" In his 2011 book American Police a History, 1845‚Äì1945, Thomas A. Reppetto, a former Chicago detective commander and ex-president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said that despite his fearsome reputation Broderick was actually beaten up on several occasions. Broderick's image, he says, \\"rested to a great extent that Broadway show business figures relied upon him for informal protection,\\" as well as on \\"rave accounts\\" of his career by Ed Sullivan, Gene Fowler, Toots Shor and others. Reppetto observed that the \\"real strength\\" of Broderick and Cordes was that they \\"had what the gangster did not, the legal right to use deadly force and the practical power to slug hoods on sight.\\" References Category:1896 births Category:1966 deaths Category:New York City Police Department officers Category:People from Manhattan Category:People from Middletown, Orange County, New York Category:People from Jackson Heights, Queens ","title":"Johnny Broderick"},{"id":"42267315","text":"Mark Sanchez (born January 17, 1987) is a former American-Mexican professional basketball player.

Formed in 1963, it soon became the second largest opposition party in Northern Nigeria overtaking the United Middle Belt Congress. In 1966, the Party was proscribed along with other political parties by the military. History In 1963, an internal crisis within the government of Northern Nigeria led to the Abdication of the Emir of Kano, Sir Muhammadu Sanusi. This spurred a wave of Nationalist protest from young Kanoans who perceived the Governments actions as having infringed on the province's autonomy. In 1963 these protests turned into open political rebellion with Tijjaniyya Sufi's led by Abubakar Uba proclaiming the KPP and calling for complete Kanoan independence from Kaduna. Kano being the largest province in the region quickly gave the KPP a formidable foothold in Regional politics and sparked a wave of reprisal attacks from the NPC dominated Provincial Native Authority Before the 1964 election all but a few members of the Party's National Committee had been imprisoned or were facing trial this forced the party into an alliance with other Regional opposition parties in the Northern Progressive Front. Proscription By 1965 the KPP had withdrawn from the Northern Progressive Front and had decided to strictly pursue Kanoan independence, however in 15 January 1966, while preparations for the 1968 general elections were going on, Nigeria's First Republic was overthrown and all political parties in the country including the KPP were proscribed. Legacy In 1967, Kanoan Nationalism scored a reticent victory when The Kano Province was officially granted marginal autonomy as a state separate from the rest of Northern Nigeria and in 1982, the government of Kano under Abubakar Rimi and the People's Redemption Party ended the long Exile of Sir Sanusi.

This self-reflection, facilitated by information collected by embedded sensors, processed locally or communicated remotely for processing, must be considered from the earliest design stage. Embedded intelligence depends on a multidisciplinary approach for successful implementation.  Delivering smarter products, systems or services to industry  Embedded intelligence aims at delivering smarter products, systems or services to industry through their integration and purposeful use for a given application. This integration can be realised by: * Construction whereby integrated assemblies show a ... fusion of technologies, as for example in semiconductor integrated circuits and ‚ÄúMore than Moore‚Äù'More Than Moore' White Paper by the IRC, International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors: http://www.itrs.net/Links/2010ITRS/IRC-ITRS-MtM-v2%203.pdf systems that build directly upon semiconductor devices. * Combination of functions whereby products are allowed to exploit multiple capabilities for improvements in use. An example would be the touch screen that combines actuation with indication. * Connection whereby the propagation of information from one product sub-element, system product or service to another is carried by wires, radio, photonic or other communication media such as sound or chemical signatures. Embedded intelligence can serve many purposes: * The monitoring of the health and usage of products and high-value assets. * The ease of use of a product, system or service. * The market appeal and acceptance where a product becomes fashionable, an example of which would be the tablet which regained popularity by the addition of enhanced services, ergonomic design in terms of shape and functionality, and enhanced aesthetics. * The ability for a service, system or product to be used by ageing, disabled or previously socially excluded people. = An application of embedded intelligence: health of high-value assets = High-value products and assets are deployed across a myriad of industrial sectors, ranging from transport, aviation, power networks, etc. Such assets present significant challenges in terms of their design, operation and maintenance due to limitations in the visibility of the assets‚Äô health. The ability to monitor these assets is impeded by aggressive ambient conditions influencing sensor drift and failure, power management and communication issues. Today's networks for transport (infrastructure, signalling and services in for example train-lines), and power transmission (i.e. smart grid, network management, protection and control) require integrated sensors that can collect reliable information, transmit it securely, and turn it from data-to-knowledge into action to close the loop. That feedback allows the system/product to build resilience and agility. = Intelligent tags in car manufacturing = When car manufacturers embedded intelligent tags into the majority of their components, temperature, vibration and other essential data can be harvested throughout the lifecycle of a car. The interrogation of fuzzy Bayesian network ontologies would enable identification and prediction of faulty components that could be replaced and reengineered to ensure greater reliability. The ontologies could also determine the genres of cars that need to be recalled - given driving history - thus lowering recall costs and enhancing consumer experience.  UK government perspective and industry need  There is an industry need for trained engineers in electronics systems as further growth is strived for within the UK, as delineated in the recently published ‚ÄúElectronics Systems: Challenges and Opportunities‚Äù (ESCO Report). This report has brought industry leaders and government together to deliver ambitious growth targets that by 2020 will see a further 150,000 people employed in electronic systems, such as those this CDT aims to provide. The report states that the critical shortages in highly trained and skilled employees can be addressed in part by the provision of Centres of Doctoral Training (CDTs) to fund and train PhD students. The Technology Strategy Board‚Äôs (TSB) High Value Manufacturing study also identified strategic themes of ‚ÄúCreating innovative products, through the integration of new materials, coatings and electronics with new manufacturing technologies‚Äù and ‚ÄúIncreasing the global competitiveness of UK manufacturing technologies by creating more efficient and effective manufacturing systems‚Äù. The report identified the need for National Competencies, including ‚ÄúIntelligent systems and embedded electronics‚Äù. Additionally through the ‚ÄúElectronics, Photonics and Electrical Systems: Key technology area 2008-2011‚Äù report, the TSB are promoting Embedded Systems as a technology that the UK has high capability in and high market potential .

Ai Chi was developed in 1993 by Jun Konno (Aquadynamics Institute, Yokohama, Japan) as an exercise to prepare for Watsu. The term Clinical Ai Chi distinguishes a more specialized form used for specific therapeutic applications.Use of the term Clinical Ai Chi has been granted by Jun Konno to the International Aquatic Therapy Foundation (IATF), Switzerland.  Technique  Typically, Ai Chi is practiced standing in shoulder-depth water in group classes, one-on-one therapy sessions, or individually. Initially, Ai Chi focuses on deep breathing patterns. Simple breathing techniques are then combined with gentle movement in a progression from the upper extremities, trunk, lower extremities, and finally to involvement of the full torso, with a gradual narrowing of the base of support. Movement is slow and continuous, with attention to body alignment, and accompanied with deep diaphragmatic breathing and a calm meditative state of mind. Mental focus is on flowing movement, proper body alignment, and coordinated breathing, and can also involve attention to philosophical or aesthetic concepts. Ai Chi consists of 19 movements or katas, performed while breathing at a rate of about 14-16 breaths per minute. The first six arm movements are based on qigong, with a relatively static and symmetrical body posture. The subsequent movements are based on Tai Chi Chuan, with continuous shifting of the center of gravity. The progression moves through a series of \\"regulatory conditions\\" of increasing difficulty, from static to dynamic, symmetrical to rotatory and asymmetrical movement, and visual to non-visual (vestibular) control.

It was released in November 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the eighth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. It also has ties to Assassin's Creed Rogue which was released for the previous generation consoles, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on the same date. The plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The story is set in Paris during the French Revolution; the single- player story follows Arno Victor Dorian in his efforts to expose the true powers behind the Revolution. The game retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as introducing a revamped combat, parkour and stealth system. The game also introduces cooperative multiplayer to the Assassin's Creed series, letting up to four players engage in narrative-driven missions and explore the open world map. Assassin's Creed Unity received mixed reviews upon its release. Praise was directed towards its visuals, improved gameplay, customization options, multiplayer-oriented format, mission design, setting, characterization, and narrative. However, the game was criticized for a lack of gameplay-innovation, unrefined controls, and numerous graphical issues and bugs upon release. Because of the game's poor launch owing to the technical issues, Ubisoft issued an apology, and offered compensation. Assassin's Creed Unity was followed by Assassin's Creed Syndicate, which takes place in Victorian England, and was released in October 2015. Gameplay Assassin's Creed Unity features a crowd system that allows more than 30,000 non-playable characters to appear on-screen simultaneously. Assassin's Creed Unity is an action-adventure stealth game set in an open world environment. The game was meant to be rebuilt, with fencing being used as an inspiration for the new system. In addition to returning weapons from previous games, Assassin's Creed Unity introduces the Phantom Blade. The Phantom Blade uses the mechanics of a crossbow to fire a silent projectile at a great distance, while still serving the same role as the Hidden Blade in previous Assassin's Creed games. Navigation for the game was also overhauled: new \\"Free-run up\\" and \\"Free-run down\\" commands were added to make it easier for the player to scale buildings in either direction. Additionally, Arno learns new moves throughout the game, but the player can also purchase new skills as well. With the updated, larger crowds, new interactions with them are also available. The crowd regularly presents many activities, appearing organically, that the player can then choose to engage in at their leisure. Examples include scaring a group of bullies by pulling out a weapon, \\"settling\\" a disagreement between two civilians by killing one of them, which is usually a Templar, or chasing down a thief who has just pick pocketed somebody. Completing a set of these crowd events gives you either a monetary reward or a piece of armor. For the first time, the series allows players to customize the characters' abilities, adopting a skill tree that enables players to assign points earned through gameplay to improve their skills in stealth, melee, and ranged combat, and health. Players are also able to customise their weapons, armour and equipment to further complement their individual style of play. These weapons and armour have a level out of 5 and a few legendary pieces of armor. The higher quality your weapons and gear are the higher you level is. Players also have a wider selection of weapons available, including swords, axes, spears, rifles, pistols and throwable items, such as smoke bombs.\\"Weapons\\". IGN. Retrieved July 3, 2015. The expansion DLC, Assassin's Creed Dead Kings, adds the formidable guillotine gun. Assassin's Creed Unity also introduces cooperative multiplayer to the series. Players can enter taverns, which act as social hubs in the game, where you can see if any friends are playing the game at the current time. If they are currently in a mission, they will appear as a \\"ghost\\" version of their player, allowing you to approach it to request to join their mission. If accepted, you are transitioned to their game and both of you reset to the most recent checkpoint, and continue on from there. Up to four players can join together in this fashion. The player will take on the role of Arno, customized within their own game, with other players appearing as their own customized version of Arno in their own sets of equipment, weapons, and armor. Many missions and activities will be available for cooperative play (which the player can also complete on their own), but there are some story missions that are single player only. Assassin's Creed also brought back a steady source of income like the ones in the Ezio games. Arno is introduced to the Cafe Theatre and is given the opportunity to renovate it and receive its profits. The starting income of the Cafe is 20 francs in 20 minutes and you can store 80 francs. After doing all the renovations and Cafe missions your income will be at around 5000 francs and a storage of 15000 francs. Renovating all Social clubs and collecting all mementos will bring your income to around 10,000 francs and a storage of 40,000 francs. The Cafe Theatre is not introduced in the game and players are left to find it for themselves. The Cafe has Arno's room which after looking from the balcony of it will give you an achievement. Renovating more rooms will unlock secret rooms and ultimately a secret passage to the Assassin's hideout. There are significant tie-ins with the Assassins Creed Unity Companion App, a \\"freemium\\" click app with limited \\"direct ties to the overall story of Unity\\". There are a significant number of chests, assassination targets, and other collectibles that are visible to all players but only accessible to those who have completed certain goals within the app. Following an update in February 2015, this requirement is no longer necessary, meaning players who have downloaded the update, can now collect all the chests in the game without having to play the companion app.Nunneley, Stephany.

Synopsis =Characters= The main character of the game is Arno Dorian (Dan Jeannotte), a native Frenchman who was born in Versailles to an Assassin father. After his father is killed by Shay Patrick Cormac at the end of Assassin's Creed Rogue, Arno is adopted, unaware that his new family holds a senior position within the Templar Order, with his new father figure being the Templar Grandmaster. Arno blames himself when his adoptive father is murdered, and so sets out on a quest of redemption that brings him into the Brotherhood of Assassins, where he slowly rises through the ranks, much like Alta√Ør Ibn- La'Ahad and Ezio Auditore da Firenze as seen in previous games. Arno's love interest is a Templar named Elise De LaSerre (Catherine B√©rub√©), the daughter of the Templar Grandmaster who adopted Arno, who also sets out to investigate more about her father's death and its role in a growing ideological change within the Templar Order that threatens its core values. Additional characters include Marquis de Sade (Alex Ivanovici), Napoleon Bonaparte (Brent Skagford) and Maximilien Robespierre (Bruce Dinsmore). =Setting= Arno's story starts in Versailles as a child, but for most of the story he is in Paris. His adventure in Paris starts on the eve of the French Revolution in 1789, and extends up to the Thermidorian Reaction in 1794. The modern day setting focuses on the Assassins contacting the player and requesting their help to explore Arno in the past, as well as helping in the present. Co-operative multiplayer missions follow the development of the Brotherhood of Assassins during the French Revolution. In addition, \\"time anomalies\\" are introduced during the story. Accessing them takes Arno to various points of Parisian history, such as Paris' Belle √âpoque, or its occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II. =Plot= The \\"Initiate\\" is a player of Helix, a gaming device produced by Abstergo that allows access to many different genetic memories. The story begins with the player playing through a memory of the sacking of the Paris Temple, and the capture of Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay, in 1307. During the sack, de Molay entrusts another Templar with a magical sword called the Sword of Eden, and a book, both of which the Templar hides within a French crypt. Upon returning from the crypt, the Templar is killed by an assassin. The memory then fast forwards to de Molay's death at the stake, and his curse towards King Phillip IV and Pope Clement V. At this point, a member of the modern day Assassin Brotherhood, codenamed: \\"Bishop,\\" hijacks the memory sequence and implores the player to join them as an initiate. Bishop provides an internal Abstergo video memo, in which Abstergo describes the capture of a Sage who contains precursor DNA (which is in a triple‚Äìrather than a double‚Äìhelix). Abstergo goes into detail regarding the Phoenix Project, whereby Abstergo hopes to use the Sage to compile a whole precursor genome for unclear purposes. Bishop provides access to another memory segment and directs the new initiate to locate another Sage, whose corpse they hope to recover. The memory then segues to Versailles in 1776, as Arno Dorian, a French nobleman's son, meets Elise De La Serre, daughter of the Templar Grand Master. After his father is murdered at the palace, Arno is taken in by Grand Master De La Serre; while the Grand Master knows Arno's father was an Assassin, Arno is oblivious. The story then skips forward 13 years, to Elise's initiation into the Templar order in 1789. Arno is given a message to deliver to De La Serre, but puts it in his office in order to sneak into the party to meet with Elise. After meeting her, Arno sneaks out, and finds De La Serre murdered in a courtyard. Arno, mistaken to be De La Serre's killer, is captured by the gendarmerie and imprisoned in the Bastille. There, he finds apocalyptic writings on the wall and impresses a fellow prisoner, the Assassin Pierre Bellec, with his fighting skills. Bellec invites Arno into the Brotherhood when they escape during the Storming of the Bastille. Arno returns home first and is turned away by Elise, who reveals that the message Arno was supposed to deliver to her father was a warning of his impending murder, and reveals herself as a Templar. Arno joins the Brotherhood and begs for the opportunity to find and eliminate the other Templars involved in De La Serre's death to redeem himself, including Le Roi des Thunes (\\"The King of Beggars\\"). He is granted his request by the Assassin Mentor Mirabeau, who was attempting to broker peace between the Orders with De La Serre. During the course of his investigation, Arno rescues Fran√ßois-Thomas Germain, a silversmith being held hostage by the acting-Templar Grand Master Lafreniere. Germain convinces Arno to kill Lafreniere, who was actually the one trying to warn De La Serre. Realizing Germain organized De La Serre's murder, Arno races against time and saves Elise from an ambush. Lafreniere's death results in the Brotherhood council questioning Arno's loyalty, as he acts rashly in his pursuit of De La Serre's killer. Arno convinces Elise to parley with the brotherhood as the latter confesses that her own faction of Templars were being murdered by a schism led by Germain. Mirabeau agrees, hoping to gain a massive favor from the potential future Grand Master of the Templars. Arno and Elise later find Mirabeau dead on his bed. Upon an investigation, Bellec turns out to be the killer, who intended to purge the Assassin leadership for beginning to agree with Templar beliefs. Refusing to join him, Arno is forced to kill Bellec. While searching the Tuileries Palace for letters written by Mirabeau to King Louis, which the Templars could use as an excuse to purge the Assassins' agents across France, Arno crosses paths with Napoleon Bonaparte (then an Artillery officer), who helps him in escaping the Palace. Realizing that Germain's plot is intended to spark a mass revolt against the King of France, Arno assassinates two central figures: an officer organizing a prisoner revolt (Captain Frederic Rouille) and a merchant hoarding food (Marie Levesque), to create the impression that the nobility was squandering resources as France starved. Bonaparte helps Arno in taking down Rouille, who served under Bonaparte during the September Massacres of 1792. After assassinating Levesque, Arno and Elise escape from the food riots via a hot air balloon. Arno professes his love for Elise as they share a moment. With the Revolution in full swing, Arno tracks Germain to the execution of King Louis XVI, but chooses to stay and protect Elise rather than pursue him. Elise rejects him for the decision, and Arno is exiled from the Brotherhood for ignoring orders to pursue his personal vendetta, causing him to fall into a drunken depression. Arno languishes for several months before he is found in Versailles by Elise who convinces him to return as Paris is tearing itself apart during the Reign of Terror. Arno returns to Paris and, with Elise's help, discredits the reputation of Maximilien de Robespierre, whom Germain, now Grand Master of the Templars, had placed in charge of maintaining chaos during the Revolution. After Arno and Elise find Robespierre, who had locked himself in his office in an attempt to avoid arrest, Elise shoots Robespierre in the jaw and makes him write down the location of Germain. Arno confronts Germain at the top of the Temple, only to find he now has the Sword of Eden. The fight eventually ends in the same Templar crypt in which the game began, where Arno strikes Germain only to have the Sword blow him backwards and trap him under rubble. Elise first attempts to help Arno out of the rubble then goes ahead to take on Germain by herself, but as Arno gets the rubble off of him and runs to protect Elise the Sword explodes, killing Elise and mortally wounding Germain. Arno then kills Germain, who in his memories confirms he is the Sage and that he wanted to purge the Templar Order of all who had forgotten the teachings of de Molay. The game closes with Arno explaining how his understanding of the Creed has changed, and promising to watch over Paris and keep Elise's memory alive. Years later, Arno, having become a Master Assassin, recovers Germain's skeleton from the Temple and places it in the Catacombs of Paris, much to the relief of Bishop, who is now confident that Abstergo will not be able to find it. Dead Kings One week after Germain's death, Arno, still feeling devastated over Elise's death, finds refuge in Saint-Denis (at the time, known as Franciade). He is contacted by the Marquis de Sade at a tavern, who requests his help in finding the manuscript of Nicolas de Condorcet, hidden in the tomb of Louis IX beneath the city, in exchange for a ship that would take Arno to Egypt. During his search, Arno encounters a group of tomb raiders, led by Captain Philippe Rose, a subordinate of Napoleon Bonaparte, who wishes to retrieve the artifact located within a Precursor temple, buried under the city's church. He also finds that the manuscript has been stolen by a child thief, L√©on, who was captured by the raiders. Arno rescues L√©on and retrieves the manuscript, but declines to help him stop the raiders. His resolve softens after an encounter with a vision of Elise, as well as hearing L√©on's pleas. After discovering the location of the temple, and retrieving the key from one of Napoleon's officers, Arno finally manages to open the door to the temple. He is then ambushed by Rose, who attempts to take the artifact for himself. Arno survives the ambush, and makes it to the artifact before Rose and his men. After killing Rose, Arno retrieves the artifact, a head-shaped lantern containing a spherical Piece of Eden, and uses it to repel the raiders and escape the temple. He later meets de Sade at the tavern and delivers the manuscript as promised. Finally, Arno decides to stay in France, and contacts the Brotherhood to deliver the Piece of Eden to Egypt, far away from the reach of Bonaparte, who is arrested for desertion and treason. Development Development for the game began shortly after the completion of 2010's Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, with the core development team splitting off during the early stages of development on Assassin's Creed III. On March 19, 2014, early screenshots of the game were leaked, as well as its title Unity. The leak revealed that Unity would feature a new location and time period, Paris during the French Revolution, a new assassin, and that it would be released in late 2014 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On March 21, Ubisoft confirmed the game's existence, having been in development for more than three years, by releasing pre-alpha game footage. They also confirmed the game's release date of Q4 2014, and that it would also see a release on Windows. Ubisoft writer Jeffrey Yohalem revealed that the French Revolution setting for the game was deliberately teased, along with Assassin's Creed IIIs American Revolution setting, in symbols seen at the end of Brotherhood. Ubisoft Montreal is the lead developer for the project, with contributing work from the Ubisoft studios in Toronto, Kiev, Singapore, Shanghai, Annecy, Montpellier, Bucharest, Quebec, and Chengdu. At E3 2014, trailers were released for the game, demonstrating the game's cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players, a first for the series. The trailer featured Lorde's cover of Everybody Wants to Rule the World, which was produced by Michael A. Levine and Lucas Cantor. The development team was able to use the new power of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to improve the NPC crowds. Up to 1000 individual AI characters can appear in a crowd, each acting independently and reacting to each other as well as the player's actions. The PC version of the game uses Nvidia's GameWorks technology such as TXAA anti-aliasing, advanced DX11 tessellation and Nvidia PhysX technology, due to a partnership between Ubisoft and Nvidia. Lead game designer Benjamin Plich has said this game will be more difficult than previous entries thanks to the removal of the counter button and more aggressive guards. Plich also said that the game will feature synchronized Double Assassinations. In August 2014, Assassin's Creed Rogue was announced for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and was revealed to have ties to the story in Unity. The game is written in a combination of C++ and C#, totaling an estimated 15.5 million lines of code of the former, and five million of the latter. =Historical representation= On October 6, 2014, Ubisoft announced that they had enlisted the help of academic historians such as Laurent Turcot, professor at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res for daily life of 18th-century Paris and Jean Clement Martin professor at the Sorbonne, to revise the script. Like other games in the series, Unity portrays a large number of real world Parisian landmarks, including the Tuileries Palace and Notre-Dame Cathedral and, through the time anomalies feature, it also includes the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty, neither of which existed at the time of the French Revolution.http://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/2014/00075547-la-faille-temporelle-d- assassin-s-creed-unity.htm La faille temporelle d'Assassin's Creed Unity, Jeuxvideo.com Notre-Dame Cathedral was modeled down to the brick, a process that took Ubisoft artist Caroline Miousse two years to complete. Because of the detail that went into the recreation of the Notre-Dame Cathedral for the game, some believe the game may help in the reconstruction of the Cathedral following the April 2019 fire that destroyed some of the building. Ubisoft donated ‚Ç¨500,000 to the reconstruction of the cathedral and also provided Unity as a free download for the week following the event so as to give everyone a chance to explore the cathedral as they had modeled it in game. Release The game was originally intended to be released worldwide on October 28, 2014. However, on August 28, 2014, it was delayed until November 11, 2014, in North America; November 13, 2014, in Europe and Australasia; and November 14, 2014, in the United Kingdom. On the delay, Vincent Pontbriand, senior producer at Ubisoft, said, \\"As we got close to the finish, we realized we were near the target but still needed a bit more time to hone some of the details to make sure Assassin's Creed Unity is exceptional.\\" Additionally, the game received a day one patch with further updates to the game.  Reception  = Critical reception = Assassin's Creed Unity received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Matt Miller from Game Informer gave the game 8/10, praising the detailed environment and architecture, decent voice acting, strategy-required missions, challenging gameplay and well-paced story missions, but criticizing the controls and balance, as well as game-breaking technical issues. He also stated that both the navigation system and the combat system still needed to be improved. Louise Blain from GamesRadar gave the game 4/5, praising the dense and atmospheric game world, character-focused mission design, overhauled free-running mechanics, in-depth character customization and satisfying combat. However, she criticized the game's framerate and poor enemy AI design. Chris Carter from Destructoid gave the game 7/10, praising the new movement system, likable lead characters, iconic setting, smooth animation and improved draw distance. New additions such as character customization and huge crowds were also praised. However, he criticized the predictable story, technical issues, and the mission design of co-op multiplayer, as it is impossible to play some missions solo. He stated that \\"Unity feels like a step back. ... It lacks that grand sense of roaming the uncharted seas in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, or even the open-ended feel of the wilderness in Assassin's Creed III, but it's a journey worth taking if you're already into the series.\\" Tom Bramwell from Eurogamer gave the game 7/10, praised the setting, rich content, inspiring story and interesting side-missions. However, he criticized the over-familiar and unimaginative mission-design, overzealous auto-correct system in the free-running mechanics and the lack of weapon customization. He described the game as a \\"missed opportunity\\". Marty Silva from IGN gave the game 7.8/10, praising the recreation of Paris and ambitious ideas presented in the multiplayer, but criticizing the unrefined stealth, weak story and lack of a strong lead character. He stated that \\"the true new-gen Assassin's Creed game is a gorgeous, entertaining, and successful proof of concept for what lies ahead for the series, though it isn't what I'd call revolutionary.\\" Tom Senior from PC Gamer gave the game 65/100, saying that \\"Unity could become a perfectly enjoyable part of the Assassin's Creed canon. It's a solid campaign elevated by quality assassination missions and an extraordinary setting that might just push the big number at the bottom of this review into the 80s, but with a big selling point out of operation, a raft of technical issues, performance problems, microtransactions and stilted combat and free-running systems, Unity‚Äîin its current state‚Äîcan only be considered a failed revolution.\\" Sam Prell from Joystiq gave the game 2.5/5, saying that \\"It's hard not to appreciate everything that it [Unity] gets right, and you'll have a good time if you can wrangle some friends for co-op, but it's impossible to ignore where Unity falls tragically short.\\" PC World stated that the game \\"is a new low for the Assassin's Creed series.\\" The review also criticized Assassin's Creed Unity for its small scale, poor gameplay, and high minimum system requirements. Similarly, CNET stated that \\"[w]hile it will likely suffice for Assassin's Creed core fans, Unity stumbles throughout and never really finds its footing.\\" In December 2015, Game Informer ranked the game as the eighth best game in the Assassin's Creed series to date. = Ubisoft's responses = Ubisoft Montreal CEO Yannis Mallat apologized on behalf of the studio with regard to the poor launch of Unity, stating that the \\"overall quality of the game was diminished by bugs and unexpected technical issues\\", and prevented users from \\"experiencing the game at its fullest potential\\". In response to the issues, Ubisoft announced that it would halt sales of the game's season pass and Gold Edition, and offer the game's first DLC campaign, Dead Kings, for free. As compensation, those who bought the season pass received a free digital download of one of six Ubisoft games (Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, The Crew, Far Cry 4, Just Dance 2015, Rayman Legends, or Watch Dogs), and would also \\"continue to have access to a variety of additional content [for Unity], including Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China\\". To claim the game, however, users had to forfeit their right to sue Ubisoft with regard to the game and the devaluation of the season pass. In February 2016 Ubisoft announced that it would not be announcing any additional Assassin's Creed games for the rest of the year, citing the many issues of Unity and stating that, \\"we've learned a lot based on your feedback.\\" In this statement, Ubisoft pledged its commitment to evolve the game's mechanics in order to create \\"more enjoyable games\\". This news has possible connections to Ubisoft's third quarter financial report, which was released on the same day, and states that Assassin's Creed Syndicate had a \\"slower launch than expected.\\" = Criticism by French Left Party = The French Left Party and its frontman Jean-Luc M√©lenchon criticized the historical interpretation the game was conveying about the French Revolution, depicting Robespierre as \\"a blood-thirsty monster\\" and Marie Antoinette as \\"a poor little girl\\". He has described Ubisoft's version of the historical period as \\"propaganda\\" that builds upon the growing sense of self-hatred spreading throughout France. M√©lenchon has expressed his criticisms in multiple media appearances, telling the New York Times that, \\"Smearing the great revolution is dirty work that aims to instill the French with even more self-loathing and talk of decline. If we continue like this, no common identity will remain possible for the French besides religion and skin color.\\" Alexis Corbi√®re, national secretary of the Left Party, said that \\"the game was conveying all the counter-revolutionary clich√©s that have been forged for two centuries\\".¬´ ... reprend √† son compte tous les poncifs contre-r√©volutionnaires forg√©s depuis plus deux si√®cles ¬ª article on French newspaper lefigaro.fr He added \\"To everyone who's gonna buy Assassin's Creed Unity, I wish you a nice time. But I also tell you that having fun doesn't prevent you from thinking. Just play it, but don't let yourself be manipulated by the propaganda\\".¬´ √Ä tous ceux qui vont acheter Assassin's Creed Unity, je leur souhaite un moment agr√©able, mais je leur dis aussi que le plaisir de jouer n'emp√™che pas de r√©fl√©chir. Jouer oui, mais ne vous laissez pas manipuler par ceux qui font de la propagande ¬ª article on French newspaper lefigaro.fr Without mentioning the criticism specifically, in an interview published on October 6, 2014, by Time, the game's creative director Alex Amancio said \\"What we actually try to do, and I think this is just a personal belief that we have, is to avoid reducing history... We try very hard to portray things as factually as possible.\\" Despite this, game producer Antoine Vimal du Monteil answered that, ultimately, \\"Assassin's Creed Unity is a mainstream video game, not a history lesson.\\"¬´ Assassin's Creed Unity est un jeu vid√©o grand public, pas une le√ßon d'histoire ¬ªArticle on French news website Arr√™t sur images.net = Sales = , Ubisoft has shipped a combined 10 million copies of Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Rogue. From April 17 to 25, 2019, Ubisoft made the PC version available free of charge with a message encouraging donations to restore Notre Dame de Paris following the fire there on April 15, 2019. Thanks to this, Ubisoft donated ‚Ç¨500,000 to help with the restoration and reconstruction of Paris' historic landmark. Controversies =Gender options in cooperative mode= After the cooperative multiplayer mode was revealed at E3 2014, additional information about the mode was revealed by creative director Alex Amancio and technical director James Therien. Amancio stated that the mode did not include the ability to play as a female avatar, due to \\"the reality of production\\". Amancio added by saying, \\"It's double the animations, it's double the voices, all that stuff and double the visual assets. Especially because we have customizable assassins. It was really a lot of extra production work,\\" which was echoed by Therien. Level designer Bruno St-Andr√© expanded on this by stating that an estimated 8,000 additional animations would have had to be recreated for a female avatar. This caused dissatisfaction in some video game community outlets. Brenna Hillier of VG247 noted how there were nine development teams working on the game, and said \\"Ubisoft has here trotted out a tired, stupid, constantly refuted excuse for why it has perpetuated the cycle of sexism and under-representation in the games industry.\\" Tim Clark of PC Gamer made note \\"that previous Assassin's Creed games have had playable women as part of the multiplayer component, and that Brotherhood had you supported by on-call assassins, many of whom were female, so it's hardly like it can't be done.\\" Clark also looked to the way Amancio and Therien answered the question and felt how they referenced \\"how much the team wanted to include playable female characters suggests... that this is probably a decision which hasn't gone down well internally.\\" Former Assassin's Creed designer Jonathan Cooper responded by saying, \\"In my educated opinion, I would estimate this to be a day or two's work. Not a replacement of 8,000 animations.\\" He also revealed that Aveline de Grandpr√©, the female protagonist of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation, \\"shares more of Connor Kenway's animations than Edward Kenway does.\\" Fans also created petitions urging Ubisoft to change their stance. Additionally, former Assassin's Creed game designer Patrice D√©silets commented that Amancio's reasoning was valid, but that Ubisoft should put in the effort to let players have gender options. Amancio attempted to clear up any confusion, by stating, \\"I understand the issue, I understand the cause, and it is a noble one, but I don't think it's relevant in the case of Unity. In Unity you play this character called Arno, and when you're playing co-op you're also playing Arno ‚Äì everybody is. It's like Aiden Pearce in Watch Dogs... Arno has different skills - you select skill points in the game, there are gear elements that have an impact and all these weapons that make the character you make your own. But you're always playing Arno... The reason we're just changing the face and keeping the bodies is we want people to show off the gear that they pick up in the game through exploration. That's why we kept that.\\" It is of note that on July 5, 2020 Tommy Fran√ßois the Vice President for Editorial & Creative Services was put on disciplinary leave and later let go amid allegations of sexual misconduct. He was the right hand man of Chief Creative Officer Serge Hasco√´t. The next day Maxime B√©land Vice President Editorial resigned. Both had been accused of sexual misconduct but were promoted after complaints to HR. B√©land had been accused of choking a female employee in 2014 a week after Unity was launched. A week later, in a press release, Ubisoft stated that three more of the top executives had chosen to resign from the company. This included Hasco√´t, Yannis Mallat Managing Director of Ubisoft Canada and C√©cile Cornet the head of Global HR. The allegations from current and former staffers claimed that complaints to the HR had been ignored for several years. It allegedly described Ubisoft as a boy's club with the business meetings happening at strip clubs. The staff openly made misogynist comments and were encouraged by the senior leaders through their behavior. In a report by Jason Schreier in Bloomberg News the issues with Hasco√´t had gone back several years and had affected the creative development on the Assassin's Creed series and the use of female protagonists. Per the report later games that did feature female protagonists at the release, were later altered to diminish the female protagonists in online play. This was due to an ingrained belief by Hasco√´t that female characters did not sell video games. =Platform parity= In October 2014, Ubisoft's senior producer Vincent Pontbriand made a statement that all console versions of the game would be locked at the same resolution of 900p. This was done \\"...to avoid all the debates and stuff.\\" Many readers took this in reference to how the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are constantly compared in the media for raw power, presuming that the PlayStation 4 version of the game's resolution was lowered to reach parity with the Xbox One's, but Ubisoft later denied that this was the reason. Instead, Pontbriand stated that the decision for parity came from the limitations of the consoles' CPUs. The number of NPCs and general amount of AI was paramount to keeping the game locked at 30 frames per second.

They offer many programs for community development and organization, such as art, culture, and human services for the neighborhood. They hope to empower the growing Latino community in Boston's South End, most notably the Villa Victoria section. __TOC__  History  IBA began in South End, Boston as a grassroots movement to fight the Boston Redevelopment Authority's urban renewal plan. In 1968, a year after forming the IBA, they had established their own housing plan given to the Boston Housing Authority and renamed themselves the \\"Emergency Tenants Council.\\" A year later, they were given the rights to develop on the parcel of land that is now Villa Victoria, and changed their name to \\"Inquilinos Boricuas en Acci√≥n\\", or \\"Puerto Rican Tenants in Action\\". This was considered a large accomplishment in terms of affordable housing, community organizing, and civil rights as they gave birth to a new community of not only Puerto Rican tenants, but Latinos of all cultures.  Mission  The goal of IBA is to empower to the residents of the neighborhood through arts, education, workforce development, and affordable housing communities that are vibrant and brightly colored to liven up the neighborhood. IBA aims to preserve safe and culturally diverse housing communities so the members are able to reach their full social, economic, or political potential. In order to achieve these goals, the group lives by a few different rules. They look for community involvement and direct representation, great leadership and planning, reinforcement of cultural pride, and effective organization around community needs. IBA uses these guidelines to go about their business.  Villa Victoria  Thought to be one of the major accomplishments in Boston's urban housing developments, Villa Victoria, or Victory Village, is located in Boston's growing South End neighborhood. It is a housing community that contains 435 low income housing units, as well as various commercial and community spaces such as restaurants, community centers, markets, and retail stores. The development was done by 1976 in four different phases; Victoria Apartments, Viviendas Apartments, South End Apartments, and Casas Borinquen Apartments. The properties in Villa Victoria have been renovated in the past ten years using funds from the Low- Income Housing Tax Credit program and the Section 8 Mark Up To Market program.

USA Today questioned if bullies should be treated as criminals in reference to Weishuhn and his suicide and announced: \\"Tragic suicides such as K.J.'s have galvanized educators into a zero-tolerance stance on bullying, and a recent analysis by the U.S. Department of Education shows that state lawmakers nationwide are increasingly willing to criminalize bullying behavior, even as experts wonder whether doing so will have the intended effect: to curb the behavior and improve the learning atmosphere.\\" The Des Moines Register wrote \\"Kenneth Weishuhn‚Äôs name has been invoked far and wide in the struggle to stem bullying and advance gay rights\\" and reported on singer Madonna flashing Weishuhn‚Äôs photo on stage in the middle of her European concert tour. Weishuhn's mother has said she was unsure if she wants to pursue charges against the school or the bullies. She stated \\"I really don‚Äôt want to ruin somebody else‚Äôs life, or take someone else‚Äôs son or daughter from them. But, I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs going to take to get it to stop.\\" Later in 2012, prosecutors could not find sufficient evidence to prosecute anyone for specific criminal acts. As laws in Iowa do not cover bullying, O'Brien County Sheriff Michael Anderson said he agreed with the decision not to file charges. =Family troubles= Weishuhn's suicide was hard on the family, with sister Kayla stating she was \\"traumatized\\" by events and still had to attend school with the bullies through the remainder of her high school years.

It was a combined Royal Navy and British Army expedition under the command of Captain Home Popham (R.N.) and Major-General Eyre Coote. The British destroyed their objectives, but the army contingent was captured by the French. History As Coote held the Dover army command, he was appointed to command the troops employed in the expedition, which Sir Home Popham had planned to cut the sluices at Ostend and thus flood that part of the Netherlands which was then in the possession of the French. The troops were only 1,300 in number. The Navy successfully disembarked them and they succeed in cutting the sluices as proposed on 18 May. They also destroyed the lock-gates of the Bruges‚ÄìOstend Canal, which made canal navigation between Holland, Flanders, and France impossible. This meant that any movement of barges had to be by sea, leaving them vulnerable to attack by the Royal Navy. A high wind off the land then sprang up, and the ships could not come in to take the troops off. French troops were hurried up, and the small English force was completely hemmed in. After a desperate resistance, in which he lost six officers and 109 men killed and wounded, Coote, who was himself severely wounded, was forced to surrender (although he was shortly back in command at Dover after a prisoner exchange).

Biography He was a decorated participant in the Soviet war effort during World War II, having been given a medal for his volunteer work as a boy during the war. Vladlen Pavlenkov was a history teacher in Soviet- bloc East Germany during 1953-1956. Returning to Gorky, he became a principal of high school, and then became a college teacher. He was married to Svelana Pavlenkova (Gerasimova) in 1957. He was arrested in 1969http://hts.memo.ru/chr5.htm, accused of propaganda and agitation. He served seven years in a Soviet labor camp, and upon his release was under pressure from KGB to emigrate from USSR. During his term in prisons, and labor camps, he continued the struggle for human rights, and was eventually put Prison #1, Vladimirskij Tsentral, for the last year and a half of his term. Pavlenkov emigrated to the United States in 1979 and, speaking little English, found work as a security guard. In 1982 he founded the non-profit organization Freedom of Communications Committee (FC), whose aim was to promote personal communications between Americans and Soviets through postal mail, telephone and telegraph. Accomplishments One of the first serious study of Soviet underground economy, \\"2x2=4\\" was written by him in sixties. All of the copies were searched for, and stolen by KGB. Whule Vladlen was against the distribution of flyers, once he was given up by the students who did so, he went to KGB building for the interrogations, occupied an office and burned the protocols of the criminal case while inside KGB building. He became the last one arrested on this charge, ending the prosecution attempts to arrest even more people from among the Gorky's intellectuals. Through his FC organization, Pavlenkov published Advice to Mailers in both English and Russian, to help ordinary citizens assure that their personal communications were delivered as intended, as well as a periodical newsletter Mail to the USSR. Pavlenkov and his organization were also instrumental in introducing five amendments to the Universal Postal Union Congress of 1984, and four more amendments in 1989. After his death on January 30, 1990, his book of autobiographical novels \\"Izbrannoe\\" was published by FC-Izdat, Arlington, MA, USA. The book consists of three novels. The first is written before the author emigrates in 1979, the second, in 1984, and the third, in 1989.

She was the mother of Ranjit's reputed son, Maharaja Sher Singh, who briefly became the ruler of the Sikh Empire from 1841 until his death in 1843. Mehtab Kaur was the senior-most of Ranjit Singh's wives and according to historian Jean-Marie Lafont, the only one to bear the title of Maharani (high queen) while his other wives bore the lesser title of Rani (queen). After her death, the title was held by Ranjit's youngest widow Jind Kaur, who served as regent of the Sikh Empire (after Sher Singh's death) from 1843 till 1846 and was the mother of Maharaja Duleep Singh. Family Mehtab Kaur, the only child of Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya (Sandhu) and his wife Sada Kaur, was born in 1782. Although Punjabi Jat Sikh, she bore the Persian name \\"Mehtab\\" (ŸÖŸáÿ™ÿßÿ®) which means 'moonlight' or 'splendor of the moon' in Persian. Her father, Gurbaksh Singh, was the only son and heir of Jai Singh Kanhaiya(a Sandhu Jat), the founder and chief of the Kanhaiya Misl. The Kanhaiyas, who had replaced the Bhangis as the most powerful misl, disputed Ranjit Singh's father's (Maha Singh) right to plunder Jammu, and in one of the many skirmishes between the two misls, Gurbaksh Singh was killed in battle against Maha Singh in February 1785. Mehtab Kaur's mother, Rani Sada Kaur, an intelligent, high spirited and ambitious woman, used to lend support of the Kanhaiya misl to Ranjit Singh till 1821, when she developed differences with him and as a consequence lost her territory to him. Marriage Jai Singh disagreed to betroth his granddaughter, Mehtab Kaur, to Maha Singh's son, Ranjit Singh. The Kanhaiya chief died shortly afterwards in 1789, leaving his estates to his widowed daughter-in-law, Sada Kaur, who took over the leadership of the Kanhaiyas. As a teenager, Ranjit Singh took hardly any interest in the affairs of the state, making his mother, Raj Kaur, anxious for his future. She felt that marriage might bring him around to the responsibilities of life. She approached Sada Kaur to fix the nuptial date. Ranjit was fifteen years old when he left Gujranwala for Batala, the chief town of the Kanhaiyas, to wed Mehtab Kaur in 1796. This alliance between the two important Sikh families was a major event for Punjab. All the leading Sikh chiefs were present at the wedding. After entering into a matrimonial alliance with the Kanhaiya Misl, Ranjit Singh wanted to consolidate his position further which could only be done by drawing some other misl to his side. He made suggestions to head of the Nakkais and early in 1798 took a second wife, who was the sister of Nakkai Sardar. The marriage turned out to be more successful than the first. His second wife bore his mother's name: Raj Kaur. She was renamed Datar Kaur and was warmly known as Mai Nakain and turned into Ranjit's most loved wife. Ranjit's second marriage gave Mehtab Kaur an excuse to return to Batala and from there on she made only occasional appearances at her husband's home. It likewise soured Sada Kaur; however she accommodated herselaf to Ranjit's polygamous wander in light of the fact that she had set her heart on greater and better things and was resolved to see that for her own particular purpose and the purposae of her exclusive tyke (and her offspring in the event that she had any), Ranjit Singh do the arrangements that she had set for him. =Issue= Maharaja Sher Singh (r. 1841 - 1843) Sada Kaur kepta on trying to bring Ranjit Singh closer to her daughtera and felt happy when Mehtab bore Ranjit his second son (and her first child) in 1804. Thanking God (Ishwar) the child was named Ishar Singh. The princea died in infancy - at the age of one and a half years. Mehtab Kaur was pregnant again in 1807 and gave birth to twin sons, Sher Singh and Tara Singh in Batala. Ranjit was near Jawalamukhi awhen he received the news of their birth, he rushed to Amritsar to pay a thanksgiving visit to the Golden Temple there. The birth of his sons was celebrated greatly. There was cheering in the illustrious camp and when Ranjit returneda to Lahore, he gave away vast entire-ties in philanthropy and the city was enlightened for a few nights. Historians differ over whether Sher Singh and Tara Singh were Ranjit Singh's biologicala sons. During March 1837, on the occasion of the marriage of Kanvar Nau Nihal Singh, Henry Edward Fane, the nephew and aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief, India, General Sir Henry Fane, who spent several days in Ranjit Singh's company, reported that the Maharaja never thoroughly acknowledged Sher Singh. The contemporary historian, Joseph Davey Cunningham, who attended the 1838 conversations between Ranjita Singh and Lord Aukland, also recorded that the Maharaja had doubts. However, Khushwant Singh, writing in 1962, considered that the rumours regarding the parentage of Sher Singh and Tara Singh were inaccurate and had been spread by Kharak Singh and his mother, Datar Kaur, in order to reduce the possibility of Ranjit Singh preferring Sher Singh, who was fast becoming his father's favourite. Despite his doubts, Ranjit Singh gave Sher Singh commands in the army and conferred honours on him, although Kharak Singh remained his favourite. However, no honours were bestowed on Tara Singh and he was not permitted to appear in court.Fane, page 121 Death After suffering from a failing health, Mehtab Kaur died in 1813. At the time of her death, Ranjit Singh was at Amritsar, where the death of the former had taken place. Ranjit Singh did not go to the incineration and other condolatory functions. After a ton of claims and influences, Dewan Mokham Chand could take the Maharaja to Sada Kaur's derah, where he played out a portion of the critical functions of condolence.

It is an authoritative description of modern English, a successor to A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language (ComGEL) published in 1985 and a predecessor of the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (CamGEL) published in 2002. The authors and some reviewers consider it a complement rather than a replacement of the former since it follows ‚Äì with few exceptions (for example in the typology of adverbials) ‚Äì the grammatical framework and concepts from ComGEL, which is also corroborated by the fact that one of LGSWE's authors, Geoffrey Leech, is also a co-author of ComGEL. Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English represents a large-scale corpus-based grammar focussing in its grammatical description of English mainly on \\"functional interpretation of the quantitative findings\\" (p. 41). These interpretations and findings are presented consistently throughout the book, with an emphasis on four major registers (functional styles), conversation, fiction, news, and academic prose, occasionally supplemented by examples from two supplementary registers: general prose (non-fiction) and non-conversational speech (e.g. lectures, sermons). Covering both British and American varieties of English in all of these registers but the last one,Only British English data form the basis for the non-conversational register (p. 25). the descriptions in LGSWE are based on a language corpus exceeding 40 million words and as such this grammar has been widely praised as a new milestone in corpus-based grammatical studies.McEnery, T., Xiao, R. and Tono, Y.: Corpus-based Language Studies: An Advanced Resource Book, Oxon/New York: Routledge, 2006, p. 85. While targeting \\"English language students and researchers\\" (p. 45), an abridged version of the grammar was released in 2002, Longman Student Grammar of Spoken and Written English, together with a workbook entitled Longman Student Grammar of Spoken and Written English Workbook, to be used by students on university and teacher-training courses.

Bush used the law to create five monuments * President Barack Obama has used the act ten times as of March 24, 2014 Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 to subject national monument declarations by the President to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The bill would prohibit: (1) the President from making more than one such declaration in a state during any presidential four-year term of office without an express Act of Congress, or (2) such a declaration from including private property without the informed written consent of the affected private property owner. The bill would require such a declaration: (1) to be considered a major federal action under NEPA if it affects more than 5,000 acres; (2) to be categorically excluded under NEPA and to expire three years after the date of the declaration (unless specifically designated as a monument by federal law) if it affects 5,000 acres or less; and (3) to be followed by a feasibility study that includes an estimate of the costs associated with managing the monument in perpetuity, including any loss of federal and state revenue. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 24, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1459 would amend the process of designating new national monuments. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to declare landmarks, structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are on federal land to be national monuments. H.R. 1459 would require an environmental review of any potential monuments that are greater than 5,000 acres. The designation of a national monument would expire after three years for any monument less than 5,000 acres unless the monument was designated by a change in the law. Under the bill, every designation would be followed by a feasibility study of the costs of managing the monument. The legislation also would limit the number of designations the President could make to one per state during a four-year term. Based on information provided by the National Park Service, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 1459 would cost about $2 million over the 2014-2018 period. Over the past 10 years, 16 national monuments have been established. The CBO estimates that the additional studies required under the legislation would increase the cost of designating a new monument by about $300,000. Enacting H.R. 1459 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 1459 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 10, 2013 by Rep. Rob Bishop (R, UT-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. It was reported by the committee alongside House Report 113-221 on September 20, 2013. On March 21, 2014, it was announced that the bill was scheduled to be considered on March 26 or 27, 2014. Debate and discussion The sponsor of the bill, Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), argued that \\"the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President.\\" His new bill, he insists, would ensure \\"that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input.\\" Supporters are reacting to President Barack Obama's actions to expand the California Coastal National Monument, something he did after the House had passed legislation, the California Coastal National Monument Expansion Act of 2013, to the same effect on July 22, 2013. Opponents of the bill, such as the Center for American Progress argue that the President's power to declare national monuments without lengthy review is needed because Congress is too slow at pass land conservation bills. According to senior-fellow Matt Lee-Ashley, \\"there is a widening gap between American families who want more parks and open spaces to get outdoors and a Congress that slashed conservation budgets, shuttered parks and blocked nearly every community-led effort to protect lands for future generations,\\" all of which requires the President to be able to take more immediate action. Opponents point to a set of 10 land conservation bills that have been reintroduced in Congress after Congress without becoming law, collectively introduced 52 times in 30 years. =Media reaction= Several media outlets, including MSNBC and the International Business Times, incorrectly reported that the bill would limit a president to only one newly declared national monument per four-year term. In fact, the bill says in Section 2(a)(3) that the limit is that \\"no more than one declaration shall be made in a State during any presidential four-year term of office without an express Act of Congress.\\" The Congressional Research Service concurs, saying in its summary that the bill would prohibit \\"the President from making more than one such declaration in a state during any presidential four-year term of office\\" (emphasis added).

He is best known as a pioneer in the field of pen computing and tablet computers. He is the founder of numerous companies, including GO Corporation, whose technology was used to develop the first smartphone and tablet PC. Kaplan is the co-founder of OnSale, the first B2C online auction site launched in 1994, five months prior to eBay. He is a recipient of the 1998 Ernst & Young Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year Award and author of the best-selling book Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure. He has been featured in major news publications, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Red Herring, and Bloomberg Businessweek. Kaplan is also the author of the 2015 book Humans Need Not Apply: A Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. Additional companies he has co-founded include artificial intelligence company Teknowledge, Inc. and social game website Winster.com. Kaplan was briefly a Fellow at the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics. Early life and education Kaplan who is Jewish attended the University of Chicago where he received a Bachelor's Degree in history and philosophy of science in 1972. He then studied computer science at the University of Pennsylvania where he graduated in 1979 with a Doctorate in computer and information science. Career While at the University of Pennsylvania, Kaplan wrote the software for the first all-digital keyboard instrument, the Synergy, sold by Digital Keyboards, Inc. In 1980. The Synergy was used by Wendy Carlos to compose Digital Moonscapes. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Kaplan joined the computer science department at Stanford University. He was a research associate with Stanford between 1979 and 1981. While at Stanford he wrote the database backend for the first personal computer natural language query system that became the first product of Symantec, called Q&A.; In 1981 he co-founded the company Teknowledge, Inc., a publicly traded artificial intelligence company. Kaplan was hired by Lotus Development Corporation to develop and design software based on Al techniques, working as the company's principal technologist. While at Lotus he developed Lotus Agenda, an early DOS-based personal information manager along with Ed Belove and Mitchell Kapor. He got the idea for another venture while riding in a plane with Kapor and discussing computer technology and the need for a notebook type computer. This idea led to the founding of GO Corporation. Jerry Kaplan lecturing at Stanford University in 2013. Kaplan co-founded GO Corporation in 1987. He believed the next generation of computers would be hand-held digital notepads which people would use a pen to write on the screen instead of typing. The company focused on developing a new type of operating system for tablet computers with touch sensitive screens. The flagship product of GO Corporation, which survived the company by many years, was PenPoint, winner of Byte Magazine's Byte Award for best operating system 1992. Go Corporation was famous for pioneering pen computer technology as well as being one of the most well-funded start-up companies during the late 1980s. The technology developed by the company was a precursor to early portable computers including the Palm Pilot and the Apple Newton, and most recently in iOS products such as Apple's iPad. AT&T; Corporation became a major investor in the company, using GO's technology to develop the EO Personal Communicator, the world's first smart phone. GO Corporation was later sold to AT&T; Corporation. Kaplan later authored Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure, a book about the history of the company in which he details his experience with company investors as well as pitching the idea to Microsoft and Apple who began to develop their own tablets as opposed to investing in GO. The book was selected as one of the Top Ten Business Books of the Year by Businessweek and was translated into Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese. Kaplan is also the co-founder of OnSale, an online auction website that he co-founded in 1994 and launched in 1995, five months prior to eBay. The site was one of the busiest in the mid 1990s with approximately 2 million hits per day. OnSale auctioned items primarily in the computer sector, namely products from manufacturers that included AT&T;, Apple, Packard-Bell, Sony, Compaq, and Dell. In 1996, Kaplan announced that he would be taking the company public. The company expanded its offerings to include sporting goods, jewelry, clothing, artwork, electronics and specialty foods. The company was later purchased by Egghead Software in 1999 for $400 million. Kaplan's original patents for OnSale were later acquired by eBay and Amazon.com.

In 2004, Kaplan launched a new venture called Winster, Inc., a social gaming website with multi-player casual games. Players on the site are encouraged to work with other players to win as opposed to competing against each other, creating a social community leading to friendship amongst players. It received its first funding from U.S. Venture Partners in 2007 and received a total of $5 million in funding as of 2011. Kaplan is still involved with Stanford University, the school where he began his career.

He came to national and international prominence after the publication of a book entitled Hamish McHamish of St Andrews: Cool Cat About Town. Hamish built up a following on social media, with a dedicated Facebook page and Twitter account set up by fans.  Early life  Hamish was born in 1999 and was initially owned by Marianne Baird, a retired BBC producer, with whom he lived during his first year. During this time he became increasingly nomadic, often spending days away from home, being fed and watered at various homes in the town. He was known to spend most of his time in and around the houses and businesses on South Street, St Andrews, close to his original home. Throughout Hamish's life, Ms. Baird cared for his well-being by ensuring he attended a veterinary surgeon every year for a health check and vaccinations.  Rise to fame  Home to the University of St Andrews, St Andrews has a large population of tourists and students who had encountered Hamish throughout the years. Hamish had several regular spots where he spent his days. These were primarily local businesses near the Holy Trinity Church and Church Square in St Andrews. The creation of a Hamish McHamish Facebook profile, with in-character messages supposedly composed by the cat, raised his profile further; he had nearly 5000 Facebook friends, accessed 05/04/14 and visitors to the town specifically sought him out to be photographed with him. A local bookshop had a \\"Hamish recommends\\" section, with cookbooks for fish and fiction featuring cats. The interest created by visitors, students and townsfolk led to the publication of a book about his everyday activities. Hamish McHamish of St Andrews: Cool Cat About Town was written by Susan McMullan. In January 2014, Hamish was chased by two dogs and escaped by climbing a tree. He was later helped to safety by students of the university and of staff a hairdressers he frequented (where he was often seen sleeping in the waiting room and would enjoy getting his hair combed). This incident encouraged Jim Leishman, Provost of Fife, to ask dog owners to ensure their pets were kept on a lead while near Hamish. He had been featured on BBC television's The One Show, and his story also appeared in a number of newspapers from across the world.  Statue  thumbHamish McHamish statue St Andrews On 5 April 2014 a bronze statue of Hamish by David Annand was unveiled in Logies Lane by Jim Leishman. The funding for the statue was raised by a public donation campaign started by Flora Selwyn, the editor of St Andrews in Focus.St Andrews In Focus magazine, an independently owned & edited bimonthly magazine.

Having completed the West Midlands Ministerial Training Course, she was made a deacon in the Church of England at Petertide 1991 (30 June) by Keith Sutton, Bishop of Lichfield, at Lichfield Cathedral. From 1991 to 1994, she served as the parish deacon of St Matthew's Church, Wolverhampton. She was ordained a priest on 23 April 1994 (by Sutton, at Lichfield Cathedral), in the first few weeks that the Church of England ordained women to the priesthood. Remaining at St Matthew's Church, she served her curacy from 1994 to 1995. From 1995 to 1998, she was assistant curate of St Andrew's Church, West Bromwich. During this time, she also worked with the Committee on Black Anglican Concern. It was founded after the Faith in the City report was published in 1985 and worked to combat racism in the Church of England. It has since been replaced by the Committee for Minority Ethnic Anglican Concerns. In 1998, she took up the role as vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Dalston, and All Saints Church, Haggerston, an inner-city parish in Hackney, London. She was appointed a Chaplain to the Queen in 2008. In 2010, she was appointed Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons in addition to her parish work. In March 2013, she was installed as a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral in recognition of \\"her service to the Church, community and most recently as Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons\\". In October 2014, it was announced that she was to become priest-in-charge of St Mary-at-Hill, City of London. She moved to her new parish in November 2014, while maintaining her additional appointments. Since November 2014, she was priest-in-charge of St Mary-at-Hill, City of London, until late 2019, additionally holding the role of Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, as well as priest vicar at Westminster Abbey and a Chaplain to the Queen. In 2012, she was tipped as likely to be one of the first women to become bishops in the Church of England. On 28 June 2019 she was announced as the next Bishop of Dover, to run the Diocese of Canterbury on behalf of the Archbishop of Canterbury. On 19 May 2018, she was one of several religious leaders to lead prayers at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. =Bishop of Dover= On 28 June 2019, it was announced that Hudson-Wilkin was to become Bishop suffragan of Dover. As a suffragan bishop, the Bishop of Dover has authority delegated by the Archbishop of Canterbury to oversee the Diocese of Canterbury as if the diocesan bishop; she took up her see immediately before her consecration, which was scheduled for 19 November 2019 at St Paul's Cathedral.https://www.canterburydiocese.org/rose-hudson-wilkin- named-bishop-of-dover/#more-27217 Press coverage of the announcement noted that she would be the first black woman to become a Church of England bishop;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-48802255 Guli Francis- Dehqani was the first ethnic minority woman to become a bishop, in 2017. On 19 November 2019, Hudson-Wilkin was consecrated a bishop by Archbishop Justin Welby at St Paul's Cathedral. She was installed as Bishop of Dover during a service at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 November 2019. Hudson-Wilkin was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for \\"services to young people and the Church\\". She was also listed in the 2020 Powerlist, of the 100 the most influential people in the UK of African/African-Caribbean descent.  Public attention  After taking up her parish role in Hackney, Hudson-Wilkin staged a rooftop protest on the church with her curate to highlight the need for funds to repair the fabric of the building. Speaking on Desert Island Discs in January 2014, she said that with so much development going on in Hackney, she was trying to draw attention to the plight of the church, which had a leaking roof, adding that she wished she could have stayed a little longer on the roof as the protest attracted donations for its repair. Hudson-Wilkin came to wider attention as the first black female to hold the role of Queen's Chaplain. When she was appointed to the Commons some people alleged that this was an act of political correctness on the part of the Speaker John Bercow. Ultimately, the traditional role was split in two with Hudson-Wilkin remaining in her Hackney parish and attending to the Commons via daily prayers and services in St Mary Undercroft, while Andrew Tremlett took up the post of Canon of Westminster and Rector of St Margaret's, Westminster. Hudson-Wilkin processing in Parliament behind the Speaker In an interview in The Observer a year after her appointment to the Commons, Hudson-Wilkin commented that she would like to see a more civil attitude among MPs: \\"That's my secret prayer actually: the world is looking on and I just believe that I would like to see a change there in the way they handle listening to each other and the way they speak to each other.\\" Hudson- Wilkin has updated the traditional 17th-century prayers before parliamentary debates by introducing mention of topical events, also saying a prayer on behalf of International Women's Day in 2010 that reportedly attracted complaints to the Speaker by some MPs. A critic of what she has described as institutional racism in the church, she has also spoken on the subject of gay marriage, telling The Times that the church is \\"obsessed with sex\\" and there are many more important issues. During her interview on Desert Island Discs, Hudson-Wilkin was asked about the proposed ordination of women as bishops and said: \\"I believe that we hold certain prejudices about certain things and we believe them to be true ... What I want is for people to be open to the possibilities that their minds might be changed.\\" She added: \\"I think the church has been the poorer actually for not having the gifts of women ‚Äì men and women ‚Äì in its leadership.\\" In an episode of the BBC programme The Big Questions aired January 2015, discussing the lack of legal recognition for humanist marriages, Hudson-Wilkin repeatedly characterised humanists as \\"anti- religion\\" and expressed bewilderment that humanists would want to get married, saying \\"Marriage is a sacred act. We see it as a gift from God, so it is not something we think anybody just gets up and, stands in front, and says I‚Äôm marrying you. If humanists are anti-religion I don‚Äôt understand why you want to keep and do all of the things that religion does.\\" Personal life She met her husband, the Revd Kenneth Wilkin, when she was training at the Church Army College. He currently serves as chaplain to HM Prison Downview near Banstead in Surrey. The couple have two daughters and a son.

It sells tickets through its website and via its smartphone app which is available on iOS and Android platforms. It was founded in 2006 by brother and sister Jamie and Kate Andrews, and started trading in 2012 from its headquarters in London. Loco2 website and apps were rebranded Rail Europe in November 2019. Functionality Raileurope.co.uk provides coverage for approximately 25 countries in Europe and is integrated with multiple rail operators, including the Rail Delivery Group in the United Kingdom, SNCF in France, Eurostar, Deutsche Bahn in Germany, SNCB in Belgium, Renfe in Spain and both Italo and Trenitalia in Italy. The company sells fares for all major high-speed rail services in Europe, such as TGV, ICE, Eurostar, AVE, Thalys, Frecciarossa, and Italo. The company's original name is both an abbreviation of the phrase \\"low CO2\\" as well as a reference to locomotive travel. Rail Europe focuses on rail travel in the UK and mainland Europe, as well as some international bus journeys. Raileurope.co.uk continued to have a carbon count facility built into its journey booking process, promoting rail travel's ability to reduce a traveller's carbon footprint by up 90%. Rail Europe acts as an alternative to traditional rail booking systems by aggregating multiple reservation systems into its service, allowing users to search for and book fares across multiple countries within one transaction. Rail Europe users can access standard rate fares as well as the discounted fares associated with each operator, such as such as Renfe's Turista Promo, Deutsche Bahn's London Sparpreis and Europa Sparpreis, as well as SNCF's Prems fares and the Rail Delivery Group's range of discounted Advance Fares. History Loco2 was founded in 2006 by Kate Andrews during her final year as an undergraduate at Sussex University. The goal initially was to launch a low- carbon travel company, specialising in grounded travel. As the company‚Äôs focus moved to European rail specifically, she was joined by her brother Jamie Andrews and Technical Director Jon Leighton, a leading contributor to Ruby on Rails. From 2011 onwards, Loco2 began to integrate with the booking systems of Europe‚Äôs major rail operators (and, since 2018, buses too). thumb thumb The company integrated with the following booking systems in Europe: In 2013, the company partnered with The Guardian to launch \\"Guardian Trains,\\" a Guardian- branded version of Loco2's train ticket booking application. In 2014 Loco2 added Vimal Khosla, previously a board member of lastminute.com, to its board. In 2016, the company underwent a full redesign, updating their logo, colourway and user platform. It also released its first smartphone apps, with an iOS version launched in April and an Android version available from July. For its apps, Loco2 launched an icon-only version of the company logo, suitable for iOS devices. In 2017, Loco2 was acquired by e-Voyageurs Groupe, the parent company of OUI.sncf, a subsidiary of SNCF. In December 2018, the founders Jamie Andrews and Kate Andrews announced their departure from the organisation, describing the decision to leave as bittersweet. In November 2019, Loco2‚Äôs website and apps were rebranded as Rail Europe. Rail Europe has been part of OUI.sncf group since 2013 selling rail products across 30 countries and 25,000 destinations. By joining forces with Loco2, both now form the newly expanded international arm of e-voyageurs SNCF. Awards * 2013 Winner PEA Awards Responsible Travel Category 2013 * 2018 British Transport Awards: Bronze award for Best European Rail Booking Website * 2018 National Transport Awards: Transport Supplier of the Year Ownership and funding Loco2 was founded as a private company, limited by shares. Its owners include founders Jamie and Kate Andrews as well as members of their family and friends. Additional investment has been secured from individuals and consortiums of angel investors. Shareholders include Ed Gillespie, founder of sustainability strategy and creative agency, Futerra, and author of Only Planet, which documents a low-carbon journey around the world. The company received a total of ¬£1 million in funding over a number of investment rounds from private angel investors. As part of its investment raising activities the company was featured on the BBC News website in a piece focusing on the \\"real life Dragons' Den\\". On 5 July 2017 Loco2 was bought by e-voyageurs Groupe, which also owns OUI.sncf. At that time, Loco2 co-founders Kate and Jamie Andrews remained with the business. Kate Andrews said it would continue to operate as an independent company, but the new owner would provide the investment needed to develop its search and booking technology while strengthening Voyages-sncf.com's position in the European online rail ticket retailing sector. Call for open data In 2011, Loco2's CEO and founder Jamie Andrews called for rail operators to provide \\"better (and fairer) access to rail data.\\" Andrews argued that a move to standardise data across Europe's different operators would serve to protect passenger rights. In 2013 the company held a ‚Äúhack day‚Äù at Google Campus in London, showcasing what could be done with open rail data in the UK. In 2017 co-founder Kate Andrews illustrated how companies such as Loco2 have made booking a train almost as easy as booking a flight by creating what is in effect a single European Rail platform.

Born 1981 in Ajdabiya as the son of Sayyid Jidran, Ibrahim was arrested in February 2005 for organizing an armed group to oust Muammar al-Qaddafi. After spending six years in Libya's Abu Salim prison with his four brothers, He was released from prison in 2011 and subsequently participated as a rebel commander in the 2011 Libyan revolution In 2012, after the revolution, Jadhran was named a commander of the Petroleum Defense Guards, the government force protecting the national oil facilities. Jadhran became dissatisfied with the actions of the central government, accusing it of corruption and incompetence, and demanded more autonomy for the eastern provinces that hold the rich oil fields. He declared that he opposes the Muslim Brotherhood that holds the central power in Tripoli, while detractors tried to link him to jihadists. He favors a federal relationship of the various provinces of Libya, where provinces would control their own resources, and the central government manages the military and foreign affairs. In 2013, Jadhran set up the Cyrenaica Political Bureau and secured control of eastern ports, namely Sidra, Ras Lanuf and Zueitina. In August 2013, Jathran issued the ‚ÄúRas Lanuf Declaration‚Äù, the declaration asks for the right to ‚Äúgovern our own affairs‚Äù. By October 2013, Jathran‚Äôs militia, the Cyrenaica Self-Defense Force, was estimated to number 17,500 men. In 2014, Jadhran attempted to sell oil excluding the central government. The MV Morning Glory was loaded with crude oil at Sidra and broke through a weak government blockade. As a result, Ali Zeidan, the Prime Minister of Libya, was ousted by the parliament led by a Muslim Brotherhood coalition. However, Jathran‚Äôs success was short-lived. The US Ambassador, Deborah K. Jones declared Jadhran‚Äôs actions to be a ‚Äútheft from the Libyan people.‚Äù At the behest of the Libyan government, US forces took control of the ship on March 16, 2014, making it unlikely that Jadhran can sell oil without the permission of the central government. On 10 September 2015 Ibrahim Jadhran accused the LNA of trying to assassinate him. In September 2017, after being released from a Libyan Prison in Nalut, Ibrahim reportedly arrived in Algeria.

He is the founder of the architecture office Vigliecca & Associados established in S√£o Paulo. Among the prominent projects are OUC Mooca-Vila Carioca (Tamanduate√≠ Neighborhoods), integrated studies in the area of 1.600 ha in S√£o Paulo (SP), Castel√£o Arena, one of the venues of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Deodoro Olympic Park, the largest Olympic area of the Rio-2016, and Parque Novo Santo Amaro V, social housing project reference; Vigliecca is known due to participation in national and international competitions, which resulted in 50 prizes and inspired the book ‚ÄúHypotheses on Reality‚Äù (2012), gathering public competition projects designed between 1971 and 2011. He is also the author of \\"The Third Territory - Collective Housing and City (2014)\\" and one of the authors of \\"Arena Castel√£o - Governador Pl√°cido Aderaldo Castelo (2014)\\" about Arena Castel√£o.  Biography  Arena Castel√£o, 2013 Graduated from the Universidad da La Republica ‚Äì UDELAR (1968), under the mentorship of Antonio Cravotto in Montevideo, he participated, while still at the University, in a study group called N√∫cleo do Sol (Center of the Sun), that was ideologically against the concepts of the Athen‚Äôs Letter and believed in the lessons of Team X, in other words, the recovery of the streets, the continuous structure with well-balanced densities and mixed uses. The N√∫cleo do Sol invested in projects related to its surroundings that were socially engaged. After graduation, he spent three years in Europe, between England, Germany, Spain and Italy, where he earned a post-graduation degree in Urbanism at the Universit√† degli Studi di Roma. Once he returned to Montevideo in the early 70‚Äôs, he was a member of the ideal-office Est√∫dio 18, later on called Est√∫dio Reconquista (Reconquer Studio). This studio enabled several multiple punctual associations, characterized by a permanent critic sense and a constant exchange of ideas, all taking place in a very fraternal atmosphere. The Bulevar Artigas Complex, residential complex for the Uruguayan Cooperative Center (CCU) was designed during this phase by H√©ctor Vigliecca, Arturo Vilaamil, Ramiro Bascans and Thomas Sprechmann. This project is part of the exhibition ‚ÄúLatin America in Construction: Architecture 1955-1980‚Äù (29 March till 19 July 2015)at the MoMA, in New York, and belongs to the permanent collection of the museum. In 1975, Hector moved to Brazil. In S√£o Paulo, he worked with the architect Joaquim Guedes (participating in the Novotel project in Morumbi) and was head of the Nacional Architecture Consortium of Contracting Engineers (CNEC) ‚Äì the golden ages of the Brazilian engineering firms ‚Äì where we developed large-scale projects such as the construction of new cities flooded by damns. Right after, he inaugurated the office Padovano & Vigliecca Architects, that stayed active for seven years and in 1996, he founded Vigliecca and Associados ‚Äì still active. In parallel to his professional career, he has been active in the academic realm since the 70‚Äôs. He was a professor at the UDELAR Architecture School in Montevideo and also at the Mackenzie and UNIP Universities in S√£o Paulo (from 1992 ‚Äì 2012). He still acts as a special guest professor and lecturer.  Prizes  Maquete da OUC Tiet√™ II, 2007 H√©ctor is one of the most awarded architects in Brazil. Amongst his main distinctions are ‚ÄúBest of 2012‚Äù, in the ‚ÄúUrbanity‚Äù category, awarded by the Paulista Association of Art Critics), ‚ÄúDistinction Award‚Äù at the S√£o Paulo International Architecture Biennial (1993 and 2003), ‚ÄúThe Best of Architecture‚Äù from Abril Publishers, for the Oscar Freire Street reurbanization project and the Heli√≥polis Favela social housing and reurbanization project, both in 2008, and the ‚ÄúMedalla de Oro‚Äù awarded by the Sociedad de Arquitectos de Uruguay (SAL) in 1977. In 2010 he received three prizes from the Brazilian Institute of Architects (IAB-SP) all at once: the ‚ÄúJoaquim Guedes Special Prize ‚Äì Best Built Work (reurbanization of the √Årea de Portais, Osasco-SP), 1ST Prize in the Urbanism category (Urban Operation Consortium Tiet√™ II Project ‚Äì Osasco-SP)and Honorable Mention on Social Housing (Parque Novo Santo Amaro V). He was recognized by the S√£o Paulo City Hall, ‚ÄúHonor to Latin-American urbanists that contributed to the construction of the city of S√£o Paulo‚Äù (2011) and was nominated for the international awards by the Marcus Foundation Prize and the Mies van der Rohe prize, the latter being one of the most relevant architecture prizes in the world. His name is mentioned of ‚ÄúPremio Mies Van der Rohe de Arquitectura Latinoamericana‚Äù book. His project entry for the international public competition for the Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo received an honorable mention (2003). This was the largest international competition done in the last two decades with an unprecedented number of 1.557 participants, involving many of the great names in the international architecture scene, from which 20 were chosen on the first phase in order to award only ten on the final phase. Hector‚Äôs team was the only non-European team select, an accomplishment that guaranteed him as a star architect of the 21 st century and also gave him an unmatched experience of developing this substantial project for over a year, visiting the site three times. The architect was honored by his home country, Uruguay, for his contribution to international football to carry out the project of Arena Castel√£o. The ceremony was held during the World Cup in Brazil in the Football Museum. H√©ctor Vigliecca and his team won the 1st Prize on the National Library Foundation Building Annex Competition. The result was announced on November 14, 2014.  Main Projects  Parque Novo Santo Amaro V, 2012 Croqui do Parque Novo Santo Amaro V, 2010 H√©ctor Vigliecca is known for introducing a new way of thinking about social housing in Brazil. He stands out as he raises questions and specific solutions for each theme, avoiding pre-conceived models and for his way of dealing with the natural landscape, respecting and recognizing the features of the environment and the pre- existing human experience. The Parque Novo Santo Amaro V project is an example. More than just housing families who used to live in precarious conditions, the project brought urban improvements to the low income community living on the borders of a water shore in the Southern part of the city of S√£o Paulo. The project is inserted in the urban landscape, enhancing its qualities. Another example is The S√≠lvio Baccarelli Residential Project (finished in 2013) but known as the Heli√≥polis Gleba H. The reurbanization and housing project in Heli√≥polis, one of the largest Brazilian favelas located in the South zone of S√£o Paulo, is the second project done by the office in this area. Complex and innovative, this project reorganizes and shapes empty spaces left between pre-existing COHAB (S√£o Paulo Metropolitan Housing Company) buildings in the same block, integrating them into a great new urban complex. In 2001 he began to develop social housing Project for two municipal government programs: Renova SP ‚Äì Per√≠metro do Morro S4 (S4 Hill Perimeter) in S√£o Paulo and Morar Carioca/Morro dos Macacos in Rio de Janeiro. Amongst the projects for which he was awarded first prize in competitions and public bidding contests are the Mooca-Vila Carioca Urban Operation Consortium, one of the largest urban plans in S√£o Paulo (2012 ‚Äì to date), and the Deodoro Olympic Park, one of the stages for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, with an area of 2,5 million square meters, where competitions in 11 Olympic and four Paralympic sports will be held at Games time. Another large-scale project done by H√©ctor and his team was the Castel√£o Arena, in Fortaleza, third largest stadium in Brazil and one of the 12 chosen to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil ‚Äì in addition to hosting the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. It was the only stadium to spend less than the estimated budget, the first one to be finished (December 15, 2012), the most affordable one of the last four World Cups, and the first South American arena to receive the international sustainability LEED certification. It is also worth mentioning the SESC Nova Igua√ßu, in Nova Igua√ßu, Rio de Janeiro. It is one of the most significant Brazilian projects of his time. This project is among the 30 most significant projects of Brazilian Architecture. This project was the one responsible for his nomination to the Mies van der Rohe award in 1998. Amongst his greatest international achievements are his Honorable Mention for the Grand Egyptian Museum and the finalist project for the Mexico National Library, both in 2003. It also was awarded an ‚ÄúHonorable Mention‚Äù for the competition Plan Nueva Alameda Providencia (2015) in Santiago Chile. Parque Novo Santo Amaro's Social Housing Project, from Vigliecca & Associados, is considered one of the most expressive projects from Americas. It is one of the 36 ‚ÄúOutstanding Projects‚Äù selected from the 225 Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize (MCHAP) nominees. The award is conducted by the Faculty of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). H√©ctor Vigliecca has participated of \\"La Biennale di Venezia\\" 2014 with two projects: Parque Novo Santo Amaro V and Jardim Vicentina.  Architectonic Work  Principles introduced by Team X such as the abandonment of the abstract city in favor of the specific city, increasing the value of pedestrian space in detriment of the road system and the recovery of the street as a place for diversity and exchange were adopted and improved in the architecture of H√©ctor Vigliecca. Through the analysis of his projects, it is possible to revisit many of the problems faced by architecture as well as issues that the city has been facing in these last four decades. It is also possible to revisit current theoretical references, with which the architect maintains a constant architectural debate. His influence coincides with an important period in which Brazil as changing the way it was facing the urban reality, including the complexities of informal occupations.

Biography After graduating from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1977, Rich moved to New York City and became a prot√©g√©e of designer Roy Halston Frowick, better known simply as Halston. They fell in with the fashion crowd of the time: Andy Warhol, Truman Capote, Liza Minnelli, and Calvin Klein, and Rich took a job as an assistant publicist for Studio 54. A 1995 New York Magazine article described the scene at Studio 54, quoting Rich: \\"One night, P.R. agent Matthew Rich watched a model spy a rolled-up $100 bill between some cushions on a sofa in Studio's celebrities-only basement.

Rich was Jackie Onassis' press agent for her last public appearance at Grand Central station for the hundredth anniversary of the Municipal Art Society. Onassis said of his ability to get reporters out of her way: \\"Matthew, you commanded those press just like a field marshal!\\" In 1989, Rich founded the boutique firm PlanetPR. The New York Post has called him a \\"p.r. powerhouse.\\" Today, he includes among his clients Stephen Baldwin and Rachel Hirschfeld. He ceased work as Victoria Gotti‚Äôs press agent after she pretended to have breast cancer for publicity's sake, a move he did not endorse. Since 1997, Rich has worked as a consultant for Donald Trump's Miss Universe Organization. He frequently accompanies Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA to red-carpet events.

The incident was allegedly witnessed by a group of children, with other members of the local community, including civil servants, claiming to have seen the craft only. The area has been popular with UFO-hunting tourists.  Allegations  The story reported by the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) claimed that a group of children had spotted a small ball in the park whilst playing (now Yuzhny Park), which quickly morphed into a disc, which landed near them. Witnesses then reported a \\"three-eyed alien\\" and a robot exiting the craft. The alien stared at a horrified onlooker, freezing them in their tracks, before departing and returning five minutes later to abduct a 16-year-old boy, using what was described as a 50 cm-long \\"pistol tube\\". Though the children were the only ones claiming to have witnessed the aliens, Lieutenant Sergei A. Matveyev of the Voronezh district police station claimed to have seen the craft. The Interior Ministry said they would dispatch troops to the area should the craft reappear.  Reports  On 17 September 1989, TASS reported that a correspondent had spoken to \\"10 or 12 youths\\" who claimed to have seen a flying saucer. The original article quoted Dr. Silanov, of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory, as confirming the location of the landing using biolocation. Silanov denied that he had ever made such a remark, or carried out such an experiment. The report was the most publicized of a series of UFO claims made by official government media, and were promoted as part of the government's new \\"openness\\". It was noted that, unlike in America, the reported beings were completely apolitical and did not even speak during their 'visit'. In the immediate aftermath of the alleged incident, hundreds of UFO reports began appearing, with a reporter from Komsomolskaya Pravda even claiming to have an exclusive interview with alien beings from Red Star. To this end, the Soviet Scientific Commission ordered an official inquiry into the alleged incident. Though the area was found to have an above-average presence of the radioactive isotope cesium, the vice-rector of the University of Voronezh quickly dispensed with the idea that this was significant. In the immediate aftermath of the supposed event, only Sovietskaya Kultura and TASS attempted to pass the story off as non-fiction, with the official Communist newspaper defending its decision, saying: \\"[I]ts coverage was motivated by 'the golden rule of journalism: the reader must know everything.\\" The newspaper was repeatedly asked whether the report was in jest and were repeatedly assured it was not. The description of the incident was very similar to stories that appeared in the American magazine Saga, but TASS reporters stated that the witnesses \\"probably haven't read it.\\" Outside of print media, the U.S. show A Current Affair also sent a crew to report on the alleged event. In a work published by Socialist Industry slightly after the alleged incident, a self-proclaimed UFO specialist asserted the marks left by the supposed landing were simply scorch marks from a burnt hay-bale.

It is situated above the small South Palatine town of Annweiler.  Geography  The hill castle lies in the forest estate of the municipality of Leinsweiler at a height of 489 metres on a rocky hill with a rounded summit, typical of the Wasgau region, as the southern part of the Palatine Forest and the adjoining northern part of the Vosges is called. Scharfenberg and its sister castles, Trifels and Anebos are known as the Trifels Group and are the symbol of Annweiler, which sprawls beneath them in the valley meadows of the River Queich. In the immediate vicinity lie the sites of two other castles, the Fensterfels and the Has.  Description  The landmark of the castle is a 20-metre-high bergfried, whose walls are made of rusticated ashlars from the Hohenstaufen era. In addition, parts of the well tower and enceinte may still be seen.  History  = Chronicle = Scharfenberg Castle was built in the first half of the 12th century under the Hohenstaufen king, Conrad III, who died in 1152. It was initially probably used as a state gaol. After its subsequent owners, a ministeriales family, had been named Scharfenberg, it became the seat of the most important member of the family in the early 13th century, the Bishop of Speyer and Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire, Conrad III of Scharfenberg. Since its destruction during the Peasants' War in 1525, the castle has lain in ruins. = Popular name = Its popular name, M√ºnz, is often thought to relate to the right of coinage (M√ºnzrecht) which was granted to Annweiler in 1219 together with its town rights. It was suspected that the town had its coins minted at the castle. However, this would have been very inconvenient and full of risk due to the isolation of the castle and its distance from the town. Its name is more likely to be derived from the Latin word munitio, which means \\"fortress\\" or \\"stronghold\\". Many other buildings in the Palatinate bear this name without having been connected with a mint.Rudolf Post: Pf√§lzisch. Einf√ºhrung in eine Sprachlandschaft.

He is the monomaniacal captain of the whaling ship Pequod. On a previous voyage, the white whale Moby Dick bit off Ahab's leg, and he now wears a prosthetic leg made out of whalebone. The whaling voyage of the Pequod ends up as a hunt for revenge on the whale, as Ahab forces the crew members to support his fanatical mission. When Moby Dick is finally sighted, Ahab's hatred robs him of all caution, and the whale drags Ahab to the bottom of the sea. Melville biographer Andrew Delbanco calls Ahab \\"a brilliant personification of the very essence of fanaticism\\".Delbanco (2005), 166 Scholar F. O. Matthiessen calls attention to the fact that Ahab is called an \\"ungodly god-like man\\". Ahab's \\"tragedy is that of an unregenerate will\\" whose \\"burning mind is barred out from the exuberance of love\\" and argues that he \\"remains damned\\".Matthiessen (1941), 457 n.5 Writer D. H. Lawrence felt little sympathy for Ahab and found that the whale should have \\"torn off both his legs, and a bit more besides\\".Lawrence (1923), 157 The character of Ahab was created under the influence of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's lecture on Hamlet and figures in biblical and classical literature such as Shakespeare and Milton. His prosthesis, for instance, has been taken for an allusion to the Oedipus myth.Sweeney (1975), 73‚Äì4. Ahab is firmly established in popular culture by cartoons, comic books, films and plays. Most famously, he provided J. M. Barrie with the model for his Captain Hook character, who is obsessed not with a whale but a crocodile.\\"Moby-Dick ‚Äì a modern tragedy.\\" The Telegraph, 27 October 2008.David Park Williams (1965).\\"Hook and Ahab: Barrie's Strange Satire on Melville.\\" PMLA, December 1965. Retrieved 25 March 2014.Barbour (1986), 16  Biography  Ahab was named by his insane, widowed mother, who died when he was twelve months old. It is interesting to note the etymology of the name Ahab derives from the Hebrew and meaning \\"to love\\" or \\"beloved\\" as cited in Strong‚Äôs Concordance no. 157 & 160\\\\. At 18 years old, Ahab first took to sea as a boy-harpooner. Less than three voyages ago, Ahab married a sweet, resigned girl, with whom he has a young son. He has been in colleges and among the cannibals, and has seen deeper wonders than the waves. He has fixed his lance, the keenest and surest on the isle of Nantucket, in stranger foes than whales. Years ago, Peleg, now the co-owner of Pequod, sailed as mate under Ahab. During that voyage, a typhoon near Japan swung her three masts overboard. Every moment the crew thought the ship would sink, the sea breaking over the ship. Yet instead of thinking of death, Captain Ahab and Peleg thought of how to save all hands, and how to rig temporary masts in order to get into the nearest port and make repairs. Before the ship sails from Nantucket, Ishmael encounters a man named Elijah who tells him about some of Ahab's past deeds. According to Elijah, Ahab once lay near death for three days and nights near Cape Horn, took part in a deadly battle against Spanish forces before an altar in Santa, and spat into its silver chalice. Ahab lost his leg during his most recent whaling voyage, leaving him with a grim disposition and a strong desire for revenge against Moby Dick. In addition to the prosthetic leg, Ahab bears a pale white mark that runs from his hairline and down one side of his face and neck, disappearing under his clothing. The mark and its origins ‚Äì whether a birthmark, the scar from a wound, or otherwise ‚Äì are rarely mentioned or discussed. Ahab's leg includes a small flat patch that he uses as a slate for making navigational calculations. The deck planks of Pequod have been bored with shallow holes, the same diameter as the lower end, to allow him to steady himself against the motion of the ship. While at sea, he turns to the ship's carpenter and blacksmith to fashion a replacement leg and fittings after damaging the one he wears. Ahab is 58 years old at the time of Pequods last voyage. Peleg and Bildad pilot the ship out of the harbor, and Ahab first appears on deck when the ship is already at sea. Instead of embarking on a regular whaling voyage, Ahab declares he is out for revenge and nails a doubloon on the mast by way of reward for the crewmember who first sights Moby Dick, the white whale. When Moby Dick is eventually sighted, a disastrous three-day chase begins. Entangled by the line of his own harpoon, Ahab falls overboard and drowns as the whale dives and takes him along. Peleg refers to Ahab respectfully as a \\"grand, ungodly, god-like man\\" but he is also nicknamed \\"Old Thunder\\". Concept and creation According to Melville biographer Leon Howard, \\"Ahab is a Shakespearean tragic hero, created according to the Coleridgean formula.\\"Howard (1940), 235 The creation of Ahab, who apparently does not derive from any captain Melville sailed under, was heavily influenced by the observation in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's lecture on Hamlet that \\"one of Shakespeare's modes of creating characters is to conceive any one intellectual or moral faculty in morbid excess, and then to place himself ... thus mutilated or diseased, under given circumstances.\\"Cited in Howard (1940), 231. Howard's italics Whenever Moby-Dicks narrator comments on Captain Ahab as an artistic creation, the language of Coleridge's lecture appears: \\"at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half-wilful over-ruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature.\\" All men \\"tragically great,\\" Ishmael says, \\"are made so through a certain morbidness.\\" All mortal greatness \\"is but disease.\\"Cited in Howard (1940), 231. Howard's italics. Ahab's speech combines Quaker archaism with Shakespeare's idiom to serve as \\"a homegrown analogue to blank verse.\\"Milder (1988), 435 Ahab's death seems to be based on an actual event. On May 18, 1843, Melville was aboard The Star which sailed for Honolulu. Aboard were two sailors from the ship Nantucket who could have told him that they had seen their second mate \\"taken out of a whaleboat by a foul line and drowned, as is Captain Ahab of Moby-Dick.\\"Heflin (2004), 189  Ahab allegorically regarded  Ahab's character is shaped by mythic and literary patterns that overlap and reinforce each other in such a complementary way that \\"the apparent irony of one allusion is frequently the truth of another.\\"Sweeney (1975), 14 For instance, allusions to Oedipus, which flesh out Ahab's ignorance and lack of self-knowledge, are complemented by references to Narcissus, which evoke the psychological causes for his ignorance.Sweeney (1975), 72 Ahab's use of a spade for a crutch in Chapter 70, \\"The Sphinx,\\" reminds the reader that he is lame, like Oedipus, and also wounded, like Prometheus.Sweeney (1975), 73 However, Ahab should be considered both in relation to the allusions and in contrast to the other characters.Sweeney (1975), 15 =King Ahab (Old Testament)= Ahab is named for the Biblical story of Ahab in the Books of Kings 16:28‚Äì22:40, the evil idol-worshipping ruler. This association prompts Ishmael to ask, after first hearing Ahab's name: \\"When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?\\" He is rebuked by one of Ahab's colleagues, who points out that \\"He did not name himself.\\"Moby-Dick Chapter 16. \\"The Ship\\" For Melville's allegory the single most important thing was that Ahab \\"did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him\\" in 16:30‚Äì31.Mansfiel and Vincent (1952), 637 The Biblical Ahab foreshadows the tragic end of Captain Ahab and the essential duality of his character. Both Ahabs are shrewd in their secular associations. The captain is successful in whaling, with a record of forty years. \\"The very evidence of this success,\\" Nathalia Wright observes, \\"is fantastically like that in King Ahab's story: Captain Ahab, too, lives in an ivory house, 'the ivory Pequod' as it is often called, tricked out in trophies of whale bones and teeth from profitable voyages.\\"Wright (1949), 62 The ship's last voyage, however, is not entirely commercial: from the moment Ahab attaches the golden doubloon on the mast, it becomes a pursuit of a perceived enemy, under a captain unable to compromise. King Ahab, an able politician but a patron of foreign gods, offended Jehovah by introducing Baal as a god. Jehovah tolerated no other gods and contrived with false prophets to destroy King Ahab.Wright (1949), 63 Like his eponym, Captain Ahab worships pagan gods, particularly the spirit of fire. Fedallah the Parsee, his harpooner, is a fire-worshipping Zoroastrian. Fedallah contributes to Ahab's death by forecasting that: * before Ahab dies, he must see two hearses: one not made by human hands and one made of American wood (the whale itself is eventually one hearse as it carries a dead body, and the Pequod the other when it sinks); * he promises to precede his captain as a pilot; * he assures Ahab that only hemp can kill him. These prophesies, accurate as they may be, deceive Ahab, who perceives them to be an assurance of victory.Wright (1949), 65 =King Lear (Shakespeare)= Charles Olson mentions three modes of madness in King Lear, the King's, the Fool's, and Edgar's, allegorized in the book, with Ahab taking the role of Lear and Pip the roles of both the Fool and Edgar.Olson (1938), in Higgins, ed., 273 Melville makes his points by way of contrasts to Shakespeare. Olson identifies the typhoon in chapter 119, \\"The Candles,\\" with the storm in Lear. \\"Ahab, unlike Lear,\\" Olson observes, \\"does not in this night of storm discover his love for his fellow wretches. On the contrary, this night Ahab uncovers his whole hate.\\"Olson (1947), p.60 Later, in chapter 125, \\"The Log and Line,\\" Ahab says to Pip, in Lear's words to his Fool, \\"Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou are tied to me by chords woven of my heart-strings.\\" Olson (1947), p. 60. While Sweeney endorses Olson's identification, he finds exaggerated the claim that Ahab learns from his cabin-boy just as Lear does from the Fool. Ahab learns \\"little or nothing\\" throughout the book.Sweeney, 1975, 43. =Satan (Milton)= Milton's Satan is \\"not the least element of which Captain Ahab is compounded,\\" says Nathalia Wright.Wright (1949), 64 The words with which Ishmael and Starbuck portray him‚Äîinfidel, impious, diabolic, blasphemous‚Äîdescribe him as a towering rebel. In \\"The Candles\\" (Ch 119) Ahab's harpoon is called a \\"fiery dart.\\" The phrase is taken from book XII of John Milton's Paradise Lost, as Henry F. Pommer recognized, where Michael promised Adam \\"spiritual armour, able to resist/ Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts\\" (XII, 491-2).Cited in Pommer (1950) 93. Pommer's italics. Pommer argues that Milton's work was more immediate than Shakespeare, because while some of Melville's soliloquies appear to find their prototypes in Shakespeare, \\"there is a slight step from dramatic monologue to fictional thought,\\" and Milton \\"had already taken that step, using, in his own extended narrative, soliloquies precisely like Melville's.\\"Pommer (1950), 55. Allusions that identify Ahab with Satan include the scene in Milton's Hell in which the following image appears: \\"Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit/Chew'd bitter ashes, which the offended taste/With spattering noise rejected\\" (X, 565‚Äì567).Cited in Pommer (1950), 66 In chapter 132, \\"The Symphony,\\" Ahab, \\"like a blighted fruit-tree he shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.\\"Cited in Pommer (1950), 67 (Pommer's italics), and 93 On the last day of the chase, Ahab muses in terms of the Creation: \\"\\"What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summerhouse to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.\\" On that day Moby Dick, \\"seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven,\\" sinks the ship. Tashtego hammers a sky-hawk to the mast: \\"And so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upward, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven with her, and helmeted herself with it.\\" Yet Pommer finds \\"most impressive of all\\" evidence the Latin in chapter 113, \\"The Forge,\\" with which Ahab baptizes his crew in name of the Devil: \\"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli.\\"Pommer (1950), 93 Ahab's scar may have been modeled on the description of Satan's face in I, 600‚Äì601, which \\"Deep scars of thunder had intrench'd.\\"Mansfield and Vincent (1952), 641 The greatness and woe of both Satan and Ahab lies in pride. \\"The proud person,\\" Pommer explains, \\"believing that he deserves treatment appropriate to his self-inflated dignity, is quick to anger when he receives a less welcome treatment. At the exaltation of the Messiah, Satan 'could not bear/Through pride that sight, and thought himself impair'd.'\\" Satan's \\"sense of injur'd merit\\" is reported in his first speech in Hell. Ahab's story, caused by Moby Dick biting off his leg, follows the same psychological pattern of being spiritually and physically impaired.Pommer (1950), 95 =Prometheus (Aeschylus)= Overlapping with Lear, the typhoon scene in \\"The Candles\\" also seems to be Melville's recreation of the mythic theft of fire. Prometheus accomplished his theft by the stealthy hiding of the divine spark in a fennel stalk. In contrast, \\"Ahab's theft is a boldly defiant deed, set amidst elemental nature in furious eruption.\\"Sweeney (1975), 37 The whole business of whaling is a theft of fire, for the sperm whale's oil is used as fuel for flames. The hunt for the White Whale, described by Ishmael as \\"the fiery hunt,\\" thus represents a conflict with a deity‚Äîhence the references to Moby Dick as a god.Sweeney (1975), 37 Ahab waving the fiery harpoon is Melville's \\"modified equivalent of Prometheus's smuggling from heaven the fire-laden fennel stalk.\\"Sweeney (1975), 38 Both Prometheus and Ahab try to alter or reverse \\"the supernatural design, and herein lies the acme of their tragic hubris.\\" Prometheus, mistakenly convinced that Zeus planned the destruction of man, stole fire in order to contravene the will of the god; Ahab, thinking his mind can penetrate the mystery of evil, is convinced that killing Moby Dick will \\"expel evil from the cosmos.\\"Sweeney (1975), 41‚Äì42 In a tragedy a hero has a mad counterpart: Prometheus has Io, Moby-Dick has Pip. The madness of Io and Pip is caused by their unintentional contact with the primal elements or with the deity. \\"The Pip who dances and shakes his tambourine before Queequeg's coffin,\\" Sweeney compares, \\"is clearly a maniac, completely detached from his former personality.\\" Likewise, Io, tortured by the gadfly, \\"bursts upon the stage in a wild dance...While on the stage, Io speaks with a disjointed frenzy much the same as Pip's.\\"Sweeney (1975), 43 =Oedipus (Sophocles)= In \\"The Candles,\\" Ahab is temporarily stricken by blindness, an allusion to the Oedipus myth.Sweeney (1975), 75 In the chapter \\"The Sphynx,\\" Ahab stands before a sperm whale's head hanging from the side of his ship: \\"it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert.\\" Ahab orders the head to \\"tell us the secret thing that is in thee.\\" Here Ahab resembles Oedipus and the monster of Thebes, the more for his using a spade alternatively as both a crutch and as a tool with which to dissect the whale. Oedipus' staff, Sweeney notes, is both \\"a walking tool and the murder weapon with which he killed his father.\\"Sweeney (1975), 73 The Promethean and Oedipean sides of Ahab connect in this chapter by way of the crutch. In addition to this, blindness is alluded to. Oedipus and Ahab are intelligent and ignorant at the same time, excessively proud, and both face a riddle (the mystery of evil).Sweeney (1975), 74 = Narcissus (Ovid) = The opening chapter contains an extended allusion to \\"that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned\\" (Ch. 1, \\"Loomings\\"). Ahab does not realize that the malice he sees in the White Whale is his own, \\"wildly projected.\\"Sweeney (1975), 84 His Narcissistic self-delusion (he is unaware that he sees himself in the whale) complements \\"his Oedipean self-ignorance\\" (he does not know who he really is). The Narcissus myth also explains why Ahab, unlike Oedipus, remains self-ignorant. While two messengers enlight Oedipus and separate him from his obsession, Narcissus and Ahab are never interrupted from theirs. The contrast between Narcissus and Ahab is that the first contemplates a beautiful image which he loves, while Ahab projects an evil image which he hates, which Sweeney calls \\"an ironic reversal on Melville's part.\\"Sweeney (1975), 85 In several ways Ahab and Moby Dick resemble each other: * both are described with images of royalty, divinity, and archeology. * both share physical features, they are scarred or wounded, and each has a prominent brow or forehead. * both share the same internal characteristics: isolated, stubborn, vengeful, quickly enraged. * Finally, both are \\"ultimately unknowable.\\" According to Ishmael in \\"The Nut,\\" all things that are mighty wear \\"a false brow to the common world.\\"Sweeney (1975), 86 Ahab hates the mask as much as he does the thing itself.  Fedallah as Echo  A subtle connection between Ahab, Moby Dick and Fedallah is formed by the imagery of the brow and forehead. According to Sweeney, Fedallah is \\"clearly an external projection of Ahab's own depravity\\" and at the same time a double of what Ahab finds most evil in the whale.Sweeney (1975), 87 Fedallah is several times described using \\"phantom\\" imagery in the chapter \\"Ahab's Boat and Crew. Fedallah.\\" In Ovid's myth Narcissus has an airy counterpart in the speech-deprived nymph Echo, who can only repeat the sounds she hears. Echo is an auditory complement to the visual reflection and a foreshadowing of Narcissus' death. In the same way Fedallah, who only says what Ahab wants to hear, is an auditory reflection of Ahab's evil, of which Moby Dick is the visual reflection. Fedallah foreshadows Ahab's death.Sweeney (1975), 88  Reception  = Critical = When the book was first published, reviewers mostly focused on Ahab and the whale. According to George Ripley in Harper's New Monthly Magazine for December 1851, Ahab \\"becomes the victim of a deep, cunning monomania; believes himself predestined to take a bloody revenge on his fearful enemy; pursues him with fierce demoniac energy of purpose.\\"Cited in Lee (2001), 331 Ripley admires the creation of Ahab, who \\"opens upon us with wonderful power. He exercises a wild, bewildering fascination by his dark and mysterious nature.\\"Cited in Lee (2001), 332 During the onset of Melville's rediscovery there was no change of emphasis on Ahab and his struggle with the whale.Sealts (1997), 64 During the 1950s and 1960s literary scholars shifted their attention to narrative technique and point of view, which for Melville studies meant that the spotlight switched from Ahab to Ishmael.Sealts (1997), 66  In popular culture  = Films, television and video = John Barrymore as Ahab Ceeley in The Sea Beast The first two film adaptations show \\"the radical surgery that Hollywood performed on Herman Melville's masterpiece.\\"Stone (1975), 179 The first was a silent movie, The Sea Beast, a romantic love story in which the character of Ahab (John Barrymore), is transformed into \\"a handsome young sailor\\"Stone (1975), 172 a New Bedford harpooner who has little in common with Ahab, not even his full name, which is extended to Ahab Ceeley. Though in the book Ahab has already lost his leg, in the film a \\"crude papier mache monster\\" bites it off.Inge (1986), 697 When the movie opened on Broadway it made $20,000 a week and ran longer than any Warner film up to that time.Inge (1986), 699 Barrymore is also Ahab in the 1930 Moby Dick, this time with his voice. Ahab is \\"shrieking in pain\\" as the ship's (called Mary-Ann) blacksmith holds a fiery, hot-bladed tool against his stump.Stone (1975), 176 Again, the whale is just a means to separate lovers. In another diversion from the book, Ahab's sweetheart is the minister's daughter, Faith Mapple. Once again, it became a hit at the box office.Inge (1986), 701 In 1955, Orson Welles played Ahab in a filmed production of his play Moby Dick Rehearsed; however, this film is considered \\"lost\\". Warner Brothers' third effort was directed in 1956 by John Huston, with a script by Ray Bradbury, the first serious attempt to follow the book.Stone (1975), 180 Completion of the script took a year, filming another year, and editing and scoring a third year. Gregory Peck's Ahab is a \\"stern authoritarian Lincoln in black.\\" The otherwise positive reviews agreed that Peck was unsuited for the part.Inge (1986), 703‚Äì5 There have been two French film versions of Moby Dick: Capitaine Achab (2004), starring Fr√©d√©ric Bonpart and Capitaine Achabin (2007) starring Denis Lavant. Ahab has been portrayed on television, beginning with Victor Jory's portrayal in 1954 on the Hallmark Hall of Fame and including portrayals by Patrick Stewart in the 1998 mini-series and William Hurt in the 2011 mini-series. In films that were released directly to video, Captain Ahab was played by Barry Bostwick in a 2010 modern-age re-imagining of Moby Dick, and by Danny Glover in the 2011 film Age of the Dragons, a fantasy-themed re- imagining. = Comic books = Ahab appears quite frequently in humorous comic strips and cartoons. Without effort an entire anthology of this material (caricature, gag cartoons, editorial cartoons) could be assembled. The one strip that most often refers to Melville is Peanuts by Charles Schulz.Inge (1986), 716‚Äì7 The futuristic comic book superhero Ahab uses harpoons. = Games = In Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, the story of Venom Snake (initially introduced as Ahab) also appears to be somewhat inspired by the fate Captain Ahab. In addition, the transport helicopter regularly used by the player is referred to as Pequod. In This Is the Police, the main character Jack Boyd is frequently compared to Ahab. The first boss in the indie game Noitu Love 2 - Mordecai Fluke - is based on Ahab. = Music = The song \\"Beneath the Waves\\" (in the 2005 album Touched by the Crimson King of the metal band Demons and Wizards) sings about Ahab's will of revenge. The alternative metal band Mastodon and their album Leviathan references him in one of their songs, with the album being based on Moby-Dick. German doom metal band Ahab is named after the character. Singer Bob Dylan references the character in his 1965 song \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" from the album Bringing It All Back Home. Singer Tom Waits also references the character in his song \\"Shiver Me Timbers\\" on his 1974 album The Heart of Saturday Night. Notes References Sources * Barbour, James.

It only accepted students that already possessed Doctor of Medicine degrees, making it a post-doctorate school. Training consisted of two courses of lectures in dentistry. A year after opening, the school changed its name to the Chicago College of Dental Surgery. Background In the early part of the 1800s dentistry was perceived to be a mechanical activity requiring only manipulative dexterity to extract an offending tooth. In many cities the role of dentist was the domain of the barber, watchmaker, blacksmith, etc. In the middle of the century dental training had become more formal and there was considerable debate whether dentistry was a separate profession or a part of the medical field. By the end of the 1800s it had been decided that dentistry was a separate profession that included some medical training (basic science and anatomy). Discussions among the dentists in Chicago about starting a dental school began in the 1860s. On January 26, 1864 staff members of Rush Medical College held the first meetings about founding a dental school, this would be followed by several more meetings over the next 5 years. Rush Medical College decided to start a dental department and on March 12, 1869 a charter was issued to found the Chicago Dental College, but all attempts to put this charter in to operation failed. In 1875-76 a small number of Chicago dentists (Oliver, Danforth, Henry Palmer Wadsworth and Balney) began providing a series of dentistry related lecture in the evenings, three or four times a week. They were attended by 12 to 15 dentists among them E D Swain, C P Pruyn, R E Koch, J W Wassell, Truman W. Brophy, A W Harlan, Frank H B Gardner and Edmund Noyes. These lectures have been referred to as the beginning of dental education in Chicago. Rush Medical College, having failed to establish a dental school, appealed to the Chicago Dental Society to look into the matter and in September 1876 a committee was appointed to do so. They concluded that the educational environment at the time was not favorable for organizing a dental school. Another meeting among dentists in 1880 also did not produce a school. In the summer of 1882 the situation had changed and progress was made in establishing Chicago first dental school. On February 20, 1883 a charter was issued for the Chicago Dental Infirmary, Collegiate Department. History When the Chicago Dental Infirmary opened on March 12, 1883 its initial faculty included G V Black, W L Copeland, W T Belfield, L L McArthur, L P Haskell, Truman W Brophy, Edmund Noyes, and A W Harlan. Generally salaries were not paid for lecture courses as the honor, pleasure and other indirect benefits of an association with an educational institute was considered sufficient compensation. On June 30, 1884 the school was rechartered and the name changed to Chicago College of Dental Surgery. The school also dropped its requirement that all students already have a Doctor of Medicine degree and changed it to a requirement that students need only be matriculating in such a degree, this eventually lead to the dropping of any medical degree requirement. Antecedence As the Chicago College of Dental Surgery an affiliation was developed with the Lake Forest University in 1890. This arrangement resulted in the school being referred to as the Lake Forest University Dental Department. This affiliation was dissolved in 1902 and the Chicago College of Dental Surgery operated unaffiliated for a couple of years until it affiliated with Valparaiso University in 1905. In 1918 this affiliation ended when World War I forced Valparaiso University into bankruptcy. The school remained unaffiliated until it merged with the Loyola University Dental School in 1926.

American doctor and neuroscientist Ted Fielding (Will Forte) has received a grant to accompany Conor to his home and stay with the family to document Conor‚Äôs recovery and his unfolding interactions with his family. Dr Fielding‚Äôs grant funds provide a source of funds to the family as Conor is now unable to produce commercially viable pieces and is compulsively obsessed with manufacturing wooden spheres. Vanetia struggles with the invasiveness of living under Ted's ever present video camera and scientific observations. Eventually, Vanetia comes to appreciate Dr Fielding's adult company. Dr Fielding‚Äôs natural uptight and formal nature begins to soften in the presence of Vanetia's free-spirited, fun-loving and optimistic personality and his video cam increasingly captures footage of Vanetia at work about the house. The movie centers on the tensions that emerge between Vanetia and Dr Fielding, Vanetia and her now-childlike husband and Vanetia and her two children. Unfolding events trigger a deadline for Vanetia to make some significant family choices for how and with whom she will live in this new post-stroke environment.

It was the last type of gun to be fitted to British submarines, finally being retired in 1974. Development and service Development of the Mark XXIII began in 1942, as a lighter replacement for the QF 4-inch gun Mark XXII, which was based on a gun introduced in 1911. It was too late to see service in World War II, but was fitted to Amphion-class submarines that completed after October 1945. It was also fitted to some T-class submarines. Between 1955 and the early 1960s, the Amphion-class boats were modernised with new streamlined conning towers and casings. This work included the removal of the deck gun, although the underlying supports for the gun mountings were retained in case they were required. This facility was put to use during the British involvement in the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation from 1962 to 1966, when the flotilla of Amphion-class submarines which were deployed in the conflict were again fitted with Mark XXIII guns.

History It was built as part of a six-storey block in about 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach and Horses and Ben Caunt's Head. As well as being Grade II listed by Historic England, the interior is on CAMRA's National Inventory as being \\"an historic pub interior of national importance\\", due to the quality and opulence of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork. The \\"SS\\" motif that can be seen etched into the glass and in a few places is because the pub was originally called the \\"Salisbury Stores\\". The use of the word \\"Stores\\" was not uncommon in pub names of that era. Other fittings include art nouveau bronze nymphs holding long-stemmed flowers with light bulbs in the middle of the flowers, which are said to be original. The pub is named after Lord Salisbury (1830‚Äì1903), who was the British Prime Minister three times between 1885 and 1902. The Cecil family still owns the building's freehold, and the Cecil family coat of arms lies between two angels supporting a canopy above the door on the corner. Nearby Cecil Court is also named after the family. Notoriety The Salisbury was well known as a gay-friendly pub from Oscar Wilde's time up until the mid-1980s. The 1961 British suspense film Victim, directed by Basil Dearden and starring Dirk Bogarde and Sylvia Syms, includes scenes inside and outside The Salisbury and was the first English language film to use the word \\"homosexual\\". In 1979, the British serial killer Dennis Nilsen attempted to murder Andrew Ho, a student from Hong Kong that he had met in The Salisbury. Although Ho went to the police and Nilsen was questioned, the student chose not to testify, so no charges were brought against Nilsen. Nilsen had already killed once, and went on to murder another fourteen young men.

They have released an EP (Inside A 7-Track Mind, 2011) and an album (November, 2013). Grace & Tony have toured nationally, headlined the historic Crockett Theater (in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee), appeared at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and performed twice on the Daytrotter Sessions, as well as performed for BalconyTV, Jimmy Lloyd's Songwriter Showcase, and Knoxville, Tennessee's Blue Plate Special programs. In addition, two of their videos (\\"Let You Down,\\" ‚ÄúNovember\\") have received regular rotation on The Country Network, as well as airplay on CMT Edge and GAC. In April 2014, the pair launched a new video series entitled Grace & Tony Greenroom Sessions. The sessions feature performance clips filmed backstage with fellow musicians shot on an iPhone. Partner site TheBoot.com world premieres session clips, which have included performances with Malcolm Parson (Carolina Chocolate Drops), Christian Lopez Band, and Misty Mountain String Band. Background Both Grace (n√©e Shultz) and Tony grew up in Lawrence County, Tennessee. The pair was exposed to music early on in their lives by their musical families (Grace's liked the Southern styles from gospel and bluegrass all the way to rock, while Tony learned from his brother, John Paul White of The Civil Wars fame). Grace used to sing in church when she was younger, was in high school chorus, and was taught to play the guitar by her grandfather starting at the age of 8. She eventually ended up playing bluegrass music, performing on mandolin, banjo, and acoustic guitar. Tony, who began playing guitar at age 15, was playing punk music before he met Grace. In Grace & Tony, he plays both acoustic guitar and baritone ukulele. Becoming a duo They met November 21, 2010. After developing a crush on Grace, Tony asked her to jam when he was between bands, and the \\"punkgrass\\" sound that evolved was a natural fusion of their music backgrounds: playing punk rock tunes on acoustic instruments such as guitar, banjo, mandolin, and ukulele. Typically Tony leans toward the melodic side of songwriting while Grace leans toward the lyrical. Discography =Inside A 7-Track Mind= Grace & Tony honed their new-found brand of music on the sidewalks of downtown Nashville, Tennessee, and ended up working with Lloyd Aur Norman and Stephen D. Jones of Villain Place in Nashville to record their debut EP, Inside A 7-Track Mind. The EP was released in 2011 and is an acoustic recording. Track Listing # 911 Away # Stacked to Kill # Parting Gifts # Let You Down # Clipped My Wings # If You‚Ä¶ # One for the Trail =November= As part of preparation for a full- length release, Grace & Tony launched a successful Kickstarter campaign and the resulting November was released on November 11, 2013. Accompanied by a full band to fill out their unique sound, they worked again with Lloyd Aur Norman and Stephen D. Jones at Villain Place in Nashville to record the album. Their songs tend to feature non-traditional stories, including lyrical tales of murder, addiction, and lost love. A lover of English literature and old- style murder mysteries, Grace's influence on the album is evident, with songs about heroic protagonists in a variety of settings taking on evil mastermind kidnappers, electromagnetic bombs, and schizophrenia. The title track, \\"November,\\" is about Grace & Tony's love story. Additional performers on the album include Robert Jones (drums/percussion), David Follis (drums, percussion), Tori Hundley (bass), Jason Dietz (bass), John Judkins (lap steel), Nikki Oliff (accordion) and Daniel Kenney (trumpet). Track listing: # Hey Grace, Hey Tony # Holy Hand Grenade # November # The Chameleon # Can We Save This? # Electricity Bomb # Where Emma Meets John # Resonate # Grassphemy # From Me To Me # La Carrera Touring Grace & Tony have shared the stage with artists such as The Lone Bellow, Billy Joe Shaver, Dom Flemons, and Carolina Chocolate Drops, as well as hitting the high seas on the Cayamo music cruise (February 2014), playing alongside the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Ricky Scaggs, Bruce Hornsby, and Lyle Lovett. In addition to US touring, they have played a string of dates in the UK. Personal life The pair married in July 2013. Grace graduated from nursing school in late 2013.

Life  Nothing is known about the parentage or ancestry of Rodrigo Mu√±oz de Guzm√°n. The onomastic customs of that time dictate that, given his patronymic Mu√±oz, he must have been the son of a Munio (Mu√±o) or Nu√±o. He was a patron of several monasteries, including the Monastery of San Cosme and San Dami√°n in Covarrubias and of the Monastery of San Crist√≥bal de Ibeas situated in San Mill√°n de Juarros which had been founded by √Ålvaro D√≠az de Oca and his wife Teresa Ord√≥√±ez, the maternal grandparents of his wife Mayor. Rodrigo and Mayor were buried there. On 20 February 1151, Gutierre Fern√°ndez de Castro with his wife Toda, and Rodrigo and his wife Mayor, Toda's sister, donated several properties that the sisters had inherited from their maternal grandparents, to the abbot of the monastery. Rodrigo Mu√±oz probably died shortly after 29 January 1186, the date when he last appears in medieval charters. Marriage and issue  Atrium and tower of the Colegiata de San Cosme y San Dami√°n de Covarrubias He married before 1150 Mayor D√≠az, daughter of Diego S√°nchez, who died in the Battle of Ucl√©s, and of Enderquina √Ålvarez, daughter of √Ålvaro D√≠az de Oca and his wife Teresa Ord√≥√±ez. At least nine children were born of this marriage: * √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n (died in 1187), governed, as tenant-in-chief, Mansilla, a toponymic which he adopted as his cognomen and as such he appears confirming several charters as √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez de Mansilla. He also governed La Pern√≠a and Li√©bana. In another document dated 1167, he mentions his brothers and sisters: Pero, Fernando, Rodrigo, Urraca, Sancha and Teresa. √Ålvaro married Sancha Rodr√≠guez de Castro, daughter of Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Castro, the Bald and Eylo √Ålvarez with whom he had Fernando and Eylo √Ålvarez, as well as Elvira and Toda √Ålvarez de Guzm√°n, the latter married to √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n, son of Rodrigo Guti√©rrez Gir√≥n. * Fernando Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n, who, according to genealogist Luis de Salazar y Castro, was the husband of Juana de Aza and father of Saint Dominic, although there is no documentary proof whatsoever sustaining this filiation. * Nu√±o or Munio Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n, who probably died young, shortly after August 1151 when he last appears confirming a donation made by King Sancho III of Castile. * Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n (died on 18 July 1195 at the Battle of Alarcos). Appointed mayordomo mayor of King Alfonso VIII in April 1194. Around May 1174 he married Mahalda, as confirmed in the donation made by King Alfonso VIII in casamento (as a wedding gift). The couple had several children, including Nu√±o P√©rez de Guzm√°n who was the head of the house of Guzm√°n, and Guill√©n P√©rez de Guzm√°n, the father of Mayor Guill√©n de Guzm√°n, mistress of King Alfonso X of Castile, the parents of Beatrice of Castile, queen consort of Portugal due to her marriage to King Afonso. * Rodrigo Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n, mentioned by his brother √Ålvaro in 1167. * Urraca Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n (died after 1189), who married Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Castro. Both appear together in 1189 when they donated Villasila and Villamelendro to the Order of Santiago, confirming as ego Petrus Roderici de Castro cum uxore mea Urraca Roderici (I, Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Castro with my wife Urraca Rodr√≠guez) * Sancha Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n, mentioned by her brother √Ålvaro in 1167. * Mar√≠a de Guzm√°n, was the first wife of Rodrigo Guti√©rrez Gir√≥n. * Teresa Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n, also mentioned by her brother √Ålvaro in 1167.

Life The second son of Captain Thomas Lawrence, R.N., by Elizabeth, daughter of Gabriel Soulden of Kinsale, and widow of a Colonel Piers, Lawrence was born in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster, on 25 May 1711. He was grandson of another Dr. Thomas Lawrence (died 1714), a royal physician who was nephew of Henry Lawrence. Accompanying his father when appointed to the Irish station about 1715, he was for a time at school in Dublin. His mother died in 1724, and his father then left the navy and settled with his family at Southampton. He attended Southampton grammar school, and in October 1727 was entered Trinity College, Oxford as a commoner. He graduated B.A. in 1730, and M.A. in 1733. Lawrence chose medicine as profession, and moved to London, where he attended the anatomical lectures of Dr. Frank Nicholls, and the practice of St. Thomas's Hospital. He graduated M.B. at Oxford, 1736, M.D. 1740, and succeeded Nicholls as anatomical reader in the university, but resided in London, where he also delivered anatomical lectures. Admitted a candidate of the London College of Physicians in 1743, Lawrence was a fellow in 1744. After filling a number of college offices he was elected president in 1767, and was annually re-elected for seven consecutive years. After 1750, finding he had competition from William Hunter, he abandoned his lectures, and concentrated on medical practice, without great success. About 1773 Lawrence's health began to fail, and he first perceived symptoms of angina pectoris, which continued. In 1782 he had an attack of paralysis, and in the same year moved from London to Canterbury, where he died on 6 June 1783. He was buried in St. Margaret's Church, and a tablet, with a Latin epitaph, was placed in Canterbury Cathedral. Works Lawrence's works were all written in Latin, and were: * Oratio Harv√¶ana, London, 1748. * Hydrops, disputatio medica, London, 1756, in the form of a dialogue between William Harvey, Sir George Ent, and Baldwin Hamey, based on the doctrines of Georg Ernst Stahl. * Pr√¶lectiones medic√¶ duodecim de calvari√¶ et capitis morbis, London, 1757. * De Natura Musculorum pr√¶lectiones tres, London, 1759. * Life of Harvey prefixed to the college edition of his Opera Omnia, London, 1766. * Life of Dr. Frank Nicholls, \\"cum conjecturis ejusdem de natura et usu partium humani corporis similarium\\", London, 1780, privately printed. Family On 25 May 1744 Lawrence was married in London to Frances Chauncy (2 January 1780), daughter of Dr. Chauncy, a physician in Derby; they had six sons and three daughters. Sir Soulden Lawrence was one of the sons. Another went to the East Indies, an occasion commemorated by Samuel Johnson, a personal friend and a patient, with the Latin alcaic ode, Ad Thomam Laurence, medicum doctissimum, cum filium peregre agentem desiderio nimis tristi prosequeretur. Lawrence had met Johnson through Richard Bathurst.

There is evidence that the disease is caused by infection with a gammaherpesvirus, equine herpesvirus 5. The disease affects usually adult horses reducing the ability to exercise as a result of the formation of nodular lesions in the lungs.  Signs and symptoms  Signs of equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis are mainly weight loss, fever, respiratory distress and depression. Unwillingness to move, mild cough and intermittent tachypnea have been reported. When the disease progresses, the general condition of the horse usually deteriorates, showing possible signs as severe dyspnea, hypoxemia or nasal discharge.  Diagnosis  Generally EMPF has been categorized as an uncommon disease in horses with idiopathic in origin. Comparing to other interstitial fibrosing lung diseases in horses, the lesions in EMPF differ remarkably due to their nodular pattern. In histologic examinations, a sharp border may be discerned between the fibrotic and intact lung tissue. Integrative fact among horses with EMPF has been frequently established to be an infection of EHV-5. Diagnosis is based on the PCR results and pathomorphological findings from lungs. The disease has been reported as part of the granumalomatous process in an apparent silicate pneumoconiosis. Among horses with diagnosed EMPF, thoracic radiography have shown several changes. Generalized mixed interstitial and nodular pattern in the lung parenchyma, large radiodense opacity in the caudodorsal area of the lung and thickened peribronchial walls. Thoracic ultrasonography have demonstrated a bilaterally generalized pleural roughening, several comet tails and multiple, hyperechogenic scattered areas.  Pathology findings  Based on a study of 5 horses by T. POTH, G. NIEDERMAIER and W. HERMANNS (2009) as well as on a study of 24 horses investigated by WILLIAMS et al. (2007), there are significant pathomorphological findings in lungs with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis. In gross findings can be noticed pulmonary induration in all lung lobes as well as lesions restricted to the lungs and the bronchiolar lymph nodes. The distribution between two patterns can be seen as a large, whitish until tan and firm nodules of fibrosis. There are noticed histological findings, such as fibrosis and inflammation in different stages and degrees. In alveolies accumulation of neutrophils can be identified, and enlarged, vacuolated macrophages with several multinucleated giant cells. In addition hypertrophy of type II pneumocytes, formation on abnormal cystic airspaces and viral eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in intraluminal macrophages.  Treatment and prognosis  Different treatments have been experimented with horses diagnosed EMPF, but the prognosis of EMPF is tentative to unfavourable.

The former Grand Trunk Railway station closed in 1969 and the building was first moved to the north-east corner of Victoria and Henry Streets for use as an art gallery and in 2004 moved across the road to its current location in Whitby Iroquois Park. History The station served as a junction with the Port Whitby & Port Perry Railway just a short distance to the east. (The Port Whitby & Port Perry became part of the Midland Railway of Canada on March 10, 1882, itself becoming part of the Grand Trunk in 1884, though the amalgamation wasn't authorized until 1893.) An additional track was added by the Grand Trunk running from the station to the location of the junction to allow trains to travel to and from Whitby Junction to Lindsay and points beyond. The station originally had its name spelled out in paint on the sides of the roof along the tracks, with an additional hanging sign mounted on the eaves under the roof (added sometime before 1920). The painted name on the roof would be gone by the 1950s. The station was closed and slated for demolition in the 1960s. A group of local arts enthusiasts had founded a community art gallery in 1967; this group purchased the former railway station in 1969 and it was moved to Henry and Victoria Streets in 1970. The building became The Station Gallery and has served as a community art gallery since then. The building was moved to Henry Street in 2005 with expansion designed by Phil Goldsmith of Goldsmith, Borgal and Company. It re-opened in 2006. The building has been protected under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since 2006. The designation by-law applies to the exterior of the station as built in 1903 and also to the boxcar (, originally from the London and Port Stanley Railway) located outside the building. The station was a product of the Grand Trunk's Building Department, designed in Railway Style,' a style whose hallmark was a copious overhanging roof which usually skirted the entire building to give protection for passengers on the platforms and entranceways. Reflecting also an acceptance of the rational and picturesque system of High Victorian design, the internal functions of this low, turreted structure are readily identifiable from the exterior.\\" This station building replaced another (now demolished) structure located on the north side of the tracks, along the Grand Trunk's line between Toronto and Montreal. It was finally closed in 1969. \\"By this time, abundant supplies of cheap gas, a vastly improved network of highways coupled with the greater flexibility of road transport, consumer preference for the automobile had rendered the station redundant.\\" =Murder at the station= Billy Stone, a 21-year-old telegraph operator, was shot and killed at the Station on December 11, 1914. One hundred years later, his murder remains unsolved. Stone was working the night shift on December 11, when a single shot rang out in the station at 12:37 am. Stone was able to call the local Bell Telephone switchboard, saying he had been shot. He was unable to identify the shooter; when help arrived, he had succumbed to the gun shot, which managed to penetrate his heart. Nothing was missing at the crime scene and no cash was taken. A bloody handprint was found at the scene; it was noted that Stone's hands were clean. An inquest was called in January 1915 but all leads turned out to be dead ends. Billy's father William Stone Sr. was examined by the inquest; feeling that he had become the prime suspect, Stone Sr. ended his life by lying down on the tracks and was run over by a passing train. The ghost of the dead telegraph operator is said to haunt the old station and has been seen by some passing through walls in the building. Police gathering evidence at the scene explained that there was no powder on the victim's clothes, indicating he had been shot from a distance, likely from the station waiting room. Stone usually extinguished the lights in the station at midnight; the only light in the station was a small lamp over the operator's desk at the time. The last person to see him alive was an accountant from the local asylum that walked past the dispatcher's office at 12:05. The three most-discussed reasons for Stone Jr.'s murder are that his father killed him for money, that he was killed over an alleged affair or that he was killed over a potential gambling debt.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 11, 2014. It was written by David H. Steinberg and directed by Michael Polcino. In the episode, Marge worries that she is setting a bad example for her daughter when Lisa declares that she does not need friends. Plot Marge makes a cake for a block party, but when the cake batter splatters everywhere in the kitchen, she is forced to get a store bought cake. At the block party, Marge places her store bought cake on the table at the same time a new neighbor places his store bought cake. Despite her initial anxiety, Marge feels at ease meeting Booth Wilkes John, a British man, who invites Marge over to adult game night with his wife. Marge wants to go, but fears that Homer will ruin another adult game night for her. She talks to Homer in bed about not having any friends, yet Lisa chimes in with being okay with not having friends herself, which makes Marge extremely uncomfortable. At the new neighbor's home, Marge and Homer mingle with the guests. The game begins with role play based on Clue, and Homer unknowingly reveals the murderer in the story, prompting the host to kick the Simpsons out. Depressed over not having friends, Marge decides to have a party for Lisa and invite everyone who knows her in order to make friends. Only one boy shows up, so Marge and Homer throw a quick party for the kid and send him off with party favors just in time as Lisa arrives home. At Springfield Elementary, Marge tries to figure out why Lisa does not have any friends. Miss Hoover tells Marge that no one in the class likes her for being too overbearing around everyone or trying to force her ideas on others. When the class has to practice square dancing, Lisa is left without a partner until Tumi, an outside student, steps in to save the day. Tumi has the same interests as Lisa, but Bart is clearly suspicious and concerned for Lisa being duped. When Bart follows Tumi to the Krusty Burger play area, he learns the truth when he witnesses Marge handing over some cash to her. Feeling betrayed and sickened by her actions, he immediately delivers the photographic evidence to Lisa, who angrily confronts Marge for her actions. Lisa tells her mother that she would have found a friend in a decade, if she waited. When Marge tries to apologize, Lisa refuses to forgive her and retreats in her room. While Marge mopes around, Grampa reveals that he paid Lenny and Carl to befriend Homer in the sandbox and to this day they are still friends. When Lisa intends to tell every psychiatrist about her ordeal, her mother is in tears, which makes Lisa secretly happy that she has found a new tactic to get what she wants from Marge. However, seeing Marge sobbing makes Lisa apologize and wish her a Happy Mother's Day. Homer and Bart flee, clearly aghast that they have forgotten Mother's Day. The next day, Tumi apologizes to Lisa for her behavior and why she accepted the bribe for payment on a new belt. She also admits she does like being friends with Lisa. Lisa forgives her, but asks for her to be more honest with her from now on. However, Lisa leaves her when Tumi admits to not being a vegetarian and eating horsemeat. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying \\"With some tinkering, 'Pay Pal,' the penultimate episode of this season, could have been something special. The central story, about Marge desperately trying to ensure that Lisa doesn‚Äôt grow up without friends, is the sort of family-centered plot that often produces the best Simpsons episodes. There are some good gags and a few affecting moments, and the Marge/Lisa relationship remains a fruitful one. It‚Äôs just that, like so many episodes this season, 'Pay Pal' frontloads too much establishing plot, forcing the emotional core of the story into a mad rush before the final credits.\\" The episode received a 1.6 rating and was watched by a total of 3.66 million people, making it the second most watched show on Animation Domination. David Steinberg was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 67th Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.

Life He was born in Aveiro, Portugal, on 4 November 1722. He seems to have been brought up at Lisbon, where he became a monk of the order of St. Augustine, and was pursuing his studies in the Portuguese capital when the city was destroyed by the earthquake of 1755. At age 40 Magellan abandoned the monastic life. About 1764 he appears to have reached England and was in communication with Da Costa of the Royal Society in 1766. For some time he acted as tutor on continental tours, and made the acquaintance of leading scholars of the day, especially in the Netherlands. Magellan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1774, and was a corresponding member of the academies of science in Paris, Madrid, and St. Petersburg. Astronomical clock made by Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan, now in Helsinki In June 1778 Magellan was at Ermenonville, the seat of the Marquis de Gerardin, and there, with M. du Presle, he visited Jean-Jacques Rousseau a few days before his death on 2 July. He added a postscript describing his visit to Du Presle's Relation des derniers Jours de J. J. Rousseau, London, 1778. Magellan settled in London soon afterwards. He was for some time engaged in superintending the construction of a set of astronomical and meteorological instruments for the court of Madrid, which he described in 1779. He devoted his last years to the construction of instruments including thermometers and barometers. He made a clock for the blind Louis Engelbert, 6th Duke of Arenberg, which indicated by bells the hours and other readings. Among Magellan's friends was the Hungarian count Maurice Benyovszky. About 1784 the count borrowed a large sum from Magellan, and was soon afterwards shot as a pirate by the French in Madagascar. Magellan never recovered the money. He died on 7 February 1790, after more than a year's illness and was buried in Islington churchyard. Although there are claims that, due to his laxity and unorthodoxy, he renounced his faith, his correspondence and other sources confirm he never gave up Catholicism.The Private Life and Character of Physicist John Hyacinth de Magellan (1722-1790) http://www.sbhc.org.br/arquivo/download?ID_ARQUIVO=54 Works Magellan's major works were: * Collection de diff√©rens Trait√©s sur des Instrumens d'Astronomie, 1775‚Äì80. * Description des Octants et Sextants Anglois, dedicated to Turgot, 1775. * Description of a Glass Apparatus for Making Mineral Waters, 1777; 3rd edit. 1783. * Description et Usages des nouveaux Barom√®tres pour mesurer la Hauteur des Montagnes et la Profondeur des Mines, 1779. * Essai sur la nouvelle Th√©orie du Feu √©l√©mentaire, et de la Chaleur des Corps, 1780. * An Essay towards a System of Mineralogy, 1788. * M√©moires de Maurice Auguste, Comte de Benyowsky. Magellan also wrote articles in the Journal de Physique, 1778‚Äì83. On the title-page of his translation of Axel Fredrik Cronstedt's System of Mineralogy, 1788, he assumed the appellation \\"Talabrico-Lusitanus\\". Magellan gave Count Benyovszky's memoirs to William Nicholson, who published them in English in 1790. Magellan's French version of the memoirs appeared after his death, and letters of Magellan to Benyowsky were published in M√≥r J√≥kai's edition of the count's memoirs.

Blue Morpho, established in 2002, is located on the Iquitos‚ÄìNauta Road at kilometer 53, one hour away by road from the city of Iquitos, Peru.  About  Blue Morpho was founded by its owner, Hamilton Souther, as a center for shamanism 300 kilometers from the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon rain forest. Blue Morpho currently has two master shamans (maestros) working in the camp, Hamilton Souther, and Don Alberto Torres Davila, as well as several apprentice shamans and a staff of over ten native Peruvians. Blue Morpho maintains its connection and roots to traditional shamanic practices through the presence of Don Alberto Torres Davila. He heads the mesa of shamans (group of shamans from the same lineage) which includes Hamilton Souther. Hamilton Souther was trained under master shamans Don Julio Llerena Pinedo and Don Alberto Torres Davila, starting in 2001 through 2006, at which time he was granted the status of maestro by his mentors. Don Julio is deceased and has passed his legacy to Don Alberto. Hamilton and Don Alberto have practiced together for over 10 years. The center consists of 13 buildings of traditional native architecture, all constructed by locals using raw materials from the jungle.  History  Hamilton Souther Hamilton Souther completed a degree in anthropology from the University of Colorado in 2000. In 2001, he left his California home and traveled to Peru. Later that year, he studied ayahuasca shamanism under various Peruvian shamans on the Aucayacu River in the Amazon rain forest, approximately 24 hours away from Iquitos, Peru, by boat. Then, in 2002, Souther began apprenticing with Don Alberto Torres Davila and Don Julio Llerena Pinedo, two medicine men in the area. Souther constructed a camp nearby, where he would live during his studies. It soon became clear to him that many Westerners would benefit from similar spiritual work, so he established Blue Morpho, named after the bright blue Amazonian butterfly of the same name. With its inception, Souther began guiding guests on the 24-hour trip by boat from Iquitos deep into the jungle. As more guests arrived, he added greater infrastructure to accommodate their needs.

Educated at the University of California, Berkeley, he held professional appointments at the United States Geological Survey, Yale University, and Stanford University. He was primarily a petrologist and mineralogist, though later in his career contributed to geochronology. He performed much of his field work in the western United States, investigating mineral deposits in Alaska, the Boulder Batholith in Montana, and the Gold Country of California. Knopf was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as President of the Geological Society of America in 1944 and received its Penrose Medal in 1959.Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America ‚Äî Life History of a Learned Society: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America Memoir 155, 168 p., . His second wife, Eleanora Knopf, was a notable geologist and frequent collaborator. Early life Knopf was born December 2, 1882, in San Francisco, California, to German American immigrants. His father was a building contractor. He grew up with his family on a ranch near Woodside, California. Career Knopf entered the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a student of petrology under Andrew Lawson. He earned a bachelor of science degree in mining geology in 1904 and a master of science degree in 1905. That same year he spent the first of six summers surveying the mineral deposits of Alaska for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). In 1906 he moved to Washington, D.C., to work for the USGS full-time. The Alaskan Division, of which Knopf was one of about a dozen members, was considered the best geologic group in the USGS at that time. Knopf's work on tin deposits in the Seward Peninsula became the basis of the dissertation for his Ph.D., which he received from Berkeley in 1909. In Alaska he also discovered the minerals hulsite and paigeite. In 1911 Knopf was promoted from assistant geologist to geologist. Over the next nine years he undertook a series of field projects for the USGS, beginning with the mining district in Montana that includes the Boulder Batholith and continuing to other western states including Nevada and California. In the latter state he surveyed the Gold Country. After discovering that universities on the eastern seaboard were paying about double the USGS salaries, Knopf left the USGS for a teaching position, and a number of his colleagues followed suit. Knopf began at Yale University in January 1920. He encouraged students to work with the USGS as he had done; this helped mitigate the agency's brain drain following the departures. Knopf began at Yale as an associate professor but was promoted to full professor in 1923. He was named the Silliman Professor of Geology in 1937 and a Sterling Professor in 1938. He was Director of Graduate Studies from 1933 until his retirement from Yale in 1951. Upon retiring he returned to his native Woodside, California, settling not far from his family's old ranch. There he accepted a visiting appointment at the Stanford University School of Earth Sciences, where he remained until his death in 1966. Knopf's field work continued through his Yale and Stanford appointments, again with a focus on western states. He continued his work in the Boulder Batholith and investigated intrusive igneous rock bodies in the Spanish Peaks in Colorado. He also contributed to the emerging field of geochronology, putting lower bounds of 2 billion years and later 4.5 billion years on the age of the Earth. Knopf was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1931. He was also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the Geological Society of America. He was President of the Geological Society of America in 1944, and he received the Penrose Medal in 1959. In 1937 he was Vice President of the Society of Economic Geologists. Personal life Eleanora Knopf, geologist and second wife of Adolph Knopf. In 1908 Knopf married Agnes Burchard Dillon. They had three daughters and one son, though one of the daughters died in infancy. Agnes died in 1918 in that year's flu pandemic. In June 1920, Knopf married fellow USGS geologist Eleanora Frances Bliss, who as Eleanora Knopf became a frequent collaborator and travel companion. When Adolph moved to Yale, which did not then hire women, Eleanora worked out of Adolph's office, teaching private classes and still accepting USGS assignments. When they moved to California, Stanford hired her as a research associate. Legacy Knopf died November 23, 1966, in Palo Alto, California. In his will he endowed a chaired professorship at Yale. The sitting Adolph Knopf Professor of Petrology is Shun-ichiro Karato. Adolph and Eleanora Knopf also endowed a graduate fellowship in petrology at Stanford. Mount Adolph Knopf in Juneau Borough, Alaska is named after him.

History The German surgeon Wilhelm Alexander Freund undertook the first ever abdominal extirpation of a cancerous uterus on January 30, 1878. The first radical hysterectomy operation was described by John G. Clark, resident gynecologist under Howard Kelly at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1895. In 1898, Ernst Wertheim, a Viennese physician, developed the radical total hysterectomy with removal of the pelvic lymph nodes and the parametrium. In 1905, he reported the outcomes of his first 270 patients. The operative mortality rate was 18%, and the major morbidity rate was 31%. In 1912, Wertheim reported on his first 500 operations and had his name assigned to the operation. In 1944, Meigs repopularized the surgical approach when he developed a modified Wertheim operation with removal of all pelvic nodes. Meigs reported a survival rate of 75% for patients with stage I disease and demonstrated an operative mortality rate of 1% when these procedures were performed by a specially trained gynecologist. Scope and indications The Wertheim‚ÄìMeigs operation is used to treat stage IA2, IB1, IB2 and IIA cervical cancers, stage II adenocarcinomas of the endometrium, upper vaginal carcinomas, uterine or cervical sarcomas, and other rare malignancies confined to the area of the cervix, uterus, and/or upper vagina. It is one of the most comprehensive gynecological interventions. It consists of the following measures: * Radical hysterectomy, the total removal of the uterus and the ligaments that hold it in place in the pelvis * Lymphadenectomy with removal of the connective and adipose tissue including the pelvic lymph nodes on both sides in the course of the arteria et vena iliaca communis, arteria et vena iliaca externa and arteria et vena iliaca interna . *Removal of surrounding the vaginal tissue from the obturator foramen to the pelvic floor. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are typically left intact, although this decision is made on an individual basis. Complications The morbidity associated with the Wertheim‚ÄìMeigs operation is substantial. The most important complications are ureteral, ureterovaginal, and vesicovaginal fistulae, appearing during the immediate postoperative convalescence period or later mainly in patients who received subsequent radiotherapy. Other complications are described: intraoperative hemorrhage due to pelvic large vessel lesion, ureter or bladder accidental section, abdominal wall dehiscence, ureteral obstruction causing hydronephrosis and renal exclusion, disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, vesical atony, often accompanied by urinary tract infection and hematuria.

On 6 November 1820, he was promoted to acting 1st Lieutenant and after the campaign he was transferred to the port of Buenos Aires as a staff officer, where he established the headquarters of the navy's Service of Hygiene.Argentina. Departamento de Estudios Hist√≥ricos Navales, 1989, pp. 142  Cisplatine War  ARA Sarand√≠On 4 December 1825, on the outbreak of the Cisplatine War, Pinedo was appointed full 1st Lieutenant and given the command of the schooner ARA Sarand√≠ in the squadron commanded by Admiral William Brown.Rodr√≠guez et al, 1999, pp. 176 Sarand√≠ took part in the unsuccessful attacks on the fortress of the Colonia del Sacramento in February and March 1826. Despite heavy losses, Brown continued with an offensive strategy and decided to attempt the capture of the Frigate Nictheroy, the flagship of Admiral James Norton (a former Royal Navy officer in the service of the Brazilian Navy). Learning that the Nictheroy was in the harbour of Montevideo, Brown assembled a squadron that included the Sarand√≠ and attempted to infiltrate the harbour on April 10. The attack was compromised by an encounter with a Brazilian launch and Brown fled pursued by the Brazilian squadron. After a ruse to separate the Brazilian squadron by scattering and then regrouping failed, Brown engaged the Brazilian squadron damaging the Nictheroy until he could escape under the cloak of darkness. Brown did not give up and resolved to try again on April 27 but by mistake the Frigate Emperatriz was attacked. Brown ordered the Sarand√≠ to move on the Nictheroy before she could reach Montevideo, but Pinedo disobeyed his orders. As part of Brown's continued aggressive campaign, on May 2, Pinedo participated in the Battle of the Ortiz bank and in the same month exchanged fire with the Macei√≥ and on May 23 his ship was hit flush with the waterline.Rodr√≠guez et al, 1999, p. 422 Pinedo participated in the convoy which resulted in the battle of Los Pozos on 11 June 1826. After Pinedo failed to engage until late in the action at the Battle of Quilmes on 29‚Äì30 July 1826 Brown relieved Pinedo of command. He was the given command of the Sin Par and cruised the coast of Brazil capturing 30 vessels, 7 of which were transferred to Buenos Aires. On 4 August 1827 he was promoted to captain, taking command of the privateer R√°pido and went on to capture two more Brazilian ships. Eventually he was taken prisoner and taken to Rio de Janeiro and released after the peace of 1828, returning to Argentine in the brigantine Riobamba.  The Falkland Islands  On 27 October 1829, Pinedo was promoted to Major and appointed once more as commander of the Sarand√≠.Rodr√≠guez et al, 1999, p. 180 The Sarand√≠ was mainly employed in the area of Carmen de Patagones and Bah√≠a Blanca. In 1831, the Sarand√≠ under Pinedo was part of the squadron under the command of Jonas Halstead Coe (). Following the USS Lexington raid of 1831, Luis Vernet refused to continue as military and civil commander in the Falklands Islands.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 61 Governor Juan Rosas conferred upon Major Esteban Mestivier the appointment of interim military and civil commander on 10 September 1832. The announcement provoked a protest from the British minister in Buenos Aires, Henry Fox, on 28 September 1832, which like the protests of 1829 against Vernet's appointment, went unanswered apart from a brief acknowledgement. This, combined with the Lexington raid of 1831 spurred the British to send a naval patrol to re-assert sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 59 ARA Sarand√≠ was tasked with taking Mestivier along with a garrison of twenty five men together with their wives and children. This small garrison included criminals sentenced to serve in the army. On 23 September 1832, the ARA Sarand√≠ left for the Falkland Islands. Some of Vernet's men also took passage including William Dickson and Henry Metcalfe, Vernet's deputy Matthew Brisbane acted in the capacity of pilot for the Sarand√≠.Pepper, 2011, pp. 368‚Äì369 On 10 October 1832, Mestivier performed a ceremony formally claiming the islands for the United Provinces. On 21 November 1832, Sarand√≠ departed on patrol around the Falkland Islands, where she encountered the American sealer The Sun under the command of T.P.Trott on 7 December 1832. After firing on The Sun and boarding her, the captain was ordered to quit the Falklands. Trott returned to Montevideo and addressed the American legation there seeking protection from an American warship. In Montevideo, Trott was instructed to return to the islands and to ignore the warning, whilst the USS Lexington was prepared to return to the islands and if necessary seize the Sarand√≠. Mestivier was a harsh disciplinarian, which resulted in a mutiny against his authority whilst the Sarand√≠ was absent on patrol. The exact circumstances of Mestivier's death are not certain. What is known is that on 21 November 1832, the Sarand√≠ departed on patrol and on 30 November 1832 Mestivier was shot and then bayoneted to death by four of the mutineers. The mutiny was suppressed by armed sailors from the French whaler Jean Jacques, whilst Mestivier's widow was taken on board the Rapid (a British sealer). The Sarand√≠ returned on 30 December 1832 and Pinedo took control. Pinedo's investigation of the mutiny was interrupted on 2 January 1833 by the arrival of HMS Clio under the command of Captain Onslow. Onslow had been sent to reassert British sovereignty over the islands and sent a note requesting that the Sarand√≠ and garrison leave the islands. > His Majesty's sloop Clio, Berkeley Sound, 2d January, 1833.

He had twenty five soldiers at his disposal,Cawkell, 2001, pp. 60 although nine men had been implicated in the mutiny as had the adjutant, captain Juan Antonio Gomila (Mestivier's second-in-command).Dest√©fani, 1982, pp. 90 This compared with the complement of twenty Royal Marines aboard the Clio. One concern was that a large number of his crew were British mercenaries, which was not unusual in the newly independent states in Latin America, where land forces were strong, but navies were frequently quite undermanned. Despite this Destefani reports that Pinedo released Gomila instructing him to arm and prepare the men, with Gomila arming the garrison. Pinedo also prepared the ship and spoke to the crew who indicated their willingness to fight but Pinedo lost his nerve and decided to offer no resistance. Pinedo's list of passengers returning aboard the Sarand√≠Pinedo protested verbally and refused to lower the Argentine flag. The British forces disembarked on 3 January and switched the flags, delivering the Argentine one to Pinedo. The British schooner Rapid departed on 5 January 1833 taking the mutineers to Buenos Aires. There is some confusion over the date of the sailing of the Sarand√≠, official protests indicate that the Sarand√≠ sailed on 5 January and modern accounts repeat this. However, the trial transcript from Pinedo's court martial indicate that the Sarand√≠ sailed a day earlier. Argentina now claims that Vernet's colony was also expelled at this time, though many historians contradict this, stating that the colonists were encouraged to remain initially under the authority of Vernet's storekeeper, William Dickson and later his deputy, Matthew Brisbane. On returning to the River Plate, the Sarand√≠ was observed by the Americans as the USS Lexington was being prepared to sail to the Falklands to protect American interests.Letter from John Mendenhall, US Legation secretary in Montevideo, to Slacum, 16 January 1883, enclosed in Slacum‚Äôs letter, 13 July 1833, to US Secretary of State Louis McLane in \\"Capt. McKeever is preparing to set sail immediately for the Islands, to give the necessary protection to our Countrymen, thus again interrupted in the exercise of their just rights, and in doing which effectually he conceives he may be even under the necessity of capturing the Sarandi\\" As a result, there was no further action by the Americans. On his return Pinedo was the subject of a Court-martial for failing to resist the British in accordance with the Argentine Military Code. He argued that he did not receive specific instructions from Buenos Aires on how to react in case of a British military expedition. He was found guilty with a split decision between execution and being expelled from the service being decided by the Judge Advocate in favour of expulsion. However, the verdict was annulled due to irregularities in the proceedings and Pinedo given another command four months later.  War against Uruguay  Pinedo was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 3 July 1833. He commanded the Brig General RosasRodr√≠guez et al, 1999, pp. 96 between April and June 1834 patrolling the River Plate before transferring to the Schooner San Martin until September, when he joined the squadron of colonel Tomas Espora, which patrolled the Paran√° river against any attempts of infiltration by the Paraguayan fleet, after threats made by Paraguayan dictator Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia. In 1835, he commanded the schooner Federaci√≥nRodr√≠guez et al, 1999, pp. 85 patrolling between Bah√≠a Blanca and Patagonia. On 29 September 1838 he was appointed colonel. Between January and May of that year he commanded the brig RepublicanoRodr√≠guez et al, 1999, pp. 100 (the former schooner General San Mart√≠n). During the French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata Pinedo, once more under the command of William Brown, engaged several French launches. On 25 February 1841 Pinedo relieved John King of command of the Brig Vigilante then part of a squadron fighting against the squadron of Fructuoso Rivera.Rodr√≠guez et al, 1999, pp. 447 Between July and December 1841 Pinedo commanded the schooner Libertad conducting patrols in the River Plate. In January 1842, he became commander of the schooner Restaurador and the General Echag√ºe (formerly the Cagancha and later renamed Republicano).Rodr√≠guez et al, 1999, pp. 69 With this small flotilla Pinedo once more under the command of William Brown). Pinedo participated in riverine action against the forces of the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose squadron was eventually destroyed at the battle of Costa Brava. Later in 1842 he organised a squadron under Republicano to operate in the Uruguay River to protect the province of Entre Rios.  Later years  In 1844, he was the military commander of Paysand√∫. He was accused of abusing his authority and admonished by General Antonio F. D√≠az, Minister of War under Manuel Oribe. Pinedo openly rebelled and was removed from office, a decision ratified by Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. The dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas ordered that he was relieved of his command and placed under arrest despite the influence of his brother General Agust√≠n de Pinedo. Pinedo later served again in the Argentine Navy, being tasked to organise a squadron by Rosas as part of a naval academy, he hoisted his flag in the schooner Julio in 1850. Pinedo instructed midshipmen until the academy was dissolved in 1851. After the Battle of Caseros in February 1852, Pinedo was discharged from the Navy, but this decision was reconsidered on 17 July 1852. Pinedo joined the blockading squadron of the Argentine Confederation based in Buenos Aires, commanding a Brig but on 20 June 1854 he defected along with his vessel into the fleet of the state of Buenos Aires led by Jos√© Murature.Moreno, pp. 740 The following day Commodore John Halstead Coe followed suit, both receiving an award of two million pesos in ounces of gold, to be distributed among the officers.Scobie, pp. 89‚Äì90 In 1864, he became an inspector in the corps of invalids.Argentina.

In a rifled barrel the projectile will spin around the bore axis as it goes through the barrel. Bore-to-sight distance The AR-15 is an example of a weapon system where the sights are high over the bore. Browning BAR is an example of a weapon system where the sights sit low and close to the bore. The distance between the bore axis and the sight axis, also known as the sight height, is an important factor to consider due to parallax principles. It is normally desirable to keep the sights of a firearm as close to the bore as possible, since a firearm with a large bore-to-sight distance will require more sight adjustment when shifting between shooting at different targets at close ranges. On the other hand, a firearm with a short bore-to-sight distance will need less sight adjustment when changing between targets at close ranges. At longer ranges the bore to sight distance will be of less importance, since gravity has affected the projectile so much that the height difference between the bore axis and the sight axis has far less impact compared to the bullet drop. Traditional bolt hunting rifles usually have had the optical center of about above the bore, while AR-type rifles and modern bolt action rifles usually have their optical center about above the bore.AR Rifles And Optics By Bryce M. Towsley On firearms with a picatinny rail, the distance from the bore to the optical axis can be divided into distance from bore axis to top of rail, and distance from top of rail to center of the optical axis. For example on an AR-type rifle, the mil-spec distance from center of bore to top of rail is 1.211 inches, or approximately . The mount height itself, that is the distance from the top of rail to center of scope, varies, but typically lies around (higher and lower mounts are also readily available). In total, this gives a typical scoped AR-style rifle a height over bore of around . Recoil control The Chiappa Rhino is an example of a pistol with a low bore axis. The Sig Sauer P226 is an example of a pistol with a high bore axis. The recoil from a fired cartridge (and the action movement) exerts a rearward impulse along the bore axis, which is commonly above the center of mass of the gun. Meanwhile, the gripped areas of the gun, where the user will exert a reactional forward push countering the recoil, is almost always below the gun's center of mass. This force couple creates a rotational torque around the mass center and make the gun pitch upwards after each shot ‚Äî a phenomenon known as muzzle rise. This is more prominent in shorter-barreled weapons such as handguns due to less frontal weight available to counter the upward lifting of the muzzle, and how high the bore axis sits above the gripping hand will also affect the degree of muzzle rise. A lower bore axis will align more of the recoil directly into the hand, creating less couple torque and thus less muzzle rise. Among other things that affect muzzle rise and felt recoil is the weight of the pistol frame and tuning of recoil springs. The presence of buttstock in long guns will also help negate the effect of muzzle rise by shifting the pivot of the muzzle rise more posteriorly towards the butt end, thus utilizing the entire gun's weight with a longer lever to counter the rise.  Bore axis in pistols  Handguns lack a buttstock to aid in recoil control, so design elements that reduce felt recoil or muzzle flip are considered highly desirable and numerous manufacturers claim their handgun design has a low bore axis, although few offer measurements to prove this claim. While a lower bore axis does typically yield reduced felt recoil and muzzle flip, shooters intent on reducing these features as much as possible (such as competitive sport shooters) will typically seek out handguns with heavy steel frames, as increasing the weight of the gun's non-reciprocating mass (the frame) yields greater reductions in felt recoil and muzzle flip than any difference in bore axis height can typically achieve. Handguns such as the CZ-75, which combine a heavy steel frame with a low bore axis (relative to other hammer-fired guns) achieve twofold reductions to felt recoil and muzzle flip, and are popular choices in many competitive shooting disciplines. Striker-fired handgun designs are typically able to achieve a lower bore axis than their hammer-fired counterparts since strikers travel straight forward, rather than up and forward like a typical hammer mechanism.

In later life Adams held satsang with a small group of devotees in California, US. He mainly advocated the path of j√±ƒÅna yoga with an emphasis on the practice of self-enquiry. Adams' teachings were not well known in his lifetime, but have since been widely circulated amongst those investigating the philosophy of Advaita and the Western devotees of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. A book of his teachings, Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams, was published in 1999.  Biography  = Early life = Robert Adams was born on January 21, 1928 in Manhattan and grew up in New York City, USA. Adams claimed that from as far back as he could remember, he had had visions of a white haired, bearded man seated at the foot of his bed, who was about two feet tall, and who used to talk to him in a language which he did not understand. He told his parents but they thought he was playing games. He would later find out that this man was a vision of his future guru Sri Ramana Maharshi. At the age of seven, Adams's father died and the visitations suddenly stopped. Adams said that he then developed a siddhi whereby whenever he wanted something, from a candy bar to a violin, all he needed to do was say the name of the object three times and the desired object would appear from somewhere, or be given to him by someone. If there was a test at school, Adams would simply say 'God, God, God' and the answers would immediately come to him; no prior study was necessary. = Awakening = Adams claimed to have had a profound spiritual awakening at the age of fourteen. It was the end of term finals maths test and Adams had not studied for it at all. As was his custom he said 'God' three times, but with a phenomenal and unintended outcome: Not long after this experience, Adams went to the school library to do a book report. While passing through the philosophy section he came across a book on yoga masters. Having no idea what yoga was, he opened the book and for the first time saw a photo of the man he had experienced visions of as a young child, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. Paramahansa Yogananda = Journey to the Guru = At the age of 16, Adams' first spiritual mentor was Joel S. Goldsmith, a Christian mystic from New York, whom he used to visit in Manhattan, in order to listen to his sermons. Goldsmith helped Adams to better understand his enlightenment and advised him to go and see Paramahansa Yogananda. Adams did so and visited Yogananda at the Self-Realization Fellowship in Encinitas, California, where he intended to be initiated as a monk. However, after speaking to him, Yogananda felt that Adams had his own path and should go to India. He told him that his satguru was Sri Ramana Maharshi and that he should go to him as soon as possible because Ramana Maharshi's body was old and in ill-health. Sri Ramana Maharshi lived at Sri Ramanasramam at the foot of Arunachala in Tamil Nadu, South India. = Ramana Maharshi = With $14,000 of inheritance money from a recently deceased aunt, Adams set off for India and his guru Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1946: Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi Adams stayed at Sri Ramanasramam for the final three years of Sri Ramana Maharshi's life. Over the course of this time he had many conversations with Sri Ramana Maharshi, and through abiding in his presence was able to confirm and further understand his own experience of awakening to the non-dual Self. In the first of these conversations, Ramana Maharshi told Adams they had been together in a previous life.Robert Adams - The Collected Works - Transcript 57 'You Have to Have Bhakti' 28th April, 1991 p. 734. After Sri Ramana Maharshi left the body in 1950 Adams spent a further seventeen years travelling around India and stayed with well known gurus such as Nisargadatta Maharaj, Anandamayi Ma, Neem Karoli Baba and Swami Ramdas to name but a few. He also spent time with less well-known teachers such as Swami Brahmadanda \\"the Staff of God\\" in the holy city of Varanasi. = Later years = In the 1960s Adams returned to the United States and lived in Hawaii and Los Angeles before finally moving to Sedona, Arizona in the mid 1990s. He was married to Nicole Adams and fathered two daughters. In the 1980s Adams developed Parkinson's disease, which forced him to settle in one location and receive the appropriate care. A small group of devotees soon grew up around him and in the early 1990s he gave weekly satsangs in the San Fernando Valley, along with other surrounding areas of Los Angeles. These satsangs were both recorded and transcribed. After several years of deteriorating health, Adams died on March 2, 1997 in Sedona, Arizona, where he was surrounded by family members and devotees. He died at the age of 69 from cancer of the liver. = Controversy = None of Robert Adams claims of visiting India or Ramana Ashram have ever been verified by anyone except himself. His claims of living in Arthur Osborne's house have been questioned by Katya Osborne and Michael James and found to be likely made up.https://nothingrealized8.wixsite.com/robertadams1 Also Ramana Ashram's The Mountain Path has concluded Robert Adams was never there: http://www.sriramana.org/ramanafiles/mountainpath/2020%20II%20April.pdf His claim to remember crib age experiences is regarded as fantasy. The earliest age of memory recall is 2 years old even for major events like hospitalization and a sibling birth. https://www.zmescience.com/research/why-we-cant-remember- before-age-3-05435/ = Related Teachers = In 1992, Ramana Maharshi's nephew V. Ganesan had a chance encounter at an airport in Los Angeles, where a student of Robert Adams approached him to ask if he would like to attend Satsang. V. Ganesan eventually met Robert Adams on multiple occasions and acclaimed him to be a fully realized Jnani. H.W.L. Poonja, a direct disciple of Ramana Maharshi who was a vehement critic of most contemporary teachers, liked Adams' teachings enough to read them out during several of his own Satsangs. Rupert Spira, the Advaita teacher, author and potter visited Robert Adams two days before Adams' death in 1997, where he learned about his then to be teacher Francis Lucille, who had previously met Adams. Many of Adams' students went on to become teachers, including Ed Muzika, Luis De Santiago, Stuart Schwartz, Pamela Wilson and John Taylor.  Teachings  = Confessions of a Jnani = Adams did not consider himself to be a teacher, a philosopher or a preacher. What he imparted he said was simply the confession of a jnani. He said he confessed his and everyone else's own reality, and encouraged students not to listen to him with their heads but with their hearts. Adams' way of communicating to his devotees was often funny, and with interludes of silence or music between questions and answers. He stated that there was no such thing as a new teaching. This knowledge could be found in the Upanishads, the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures. = Silence of the Heart = Adams did not write any books himself nor publish his teachings as he did not wish to gain a large following. He instead preferred to teach a small number of dedicated seekers. However, in 1992, a book of his dialogues was transcribed, compiled and distributed by and for the sole use of his devotees.Muzika, Ed, (1992) Photographs of First Edition - Silence of the Heart - First Edition In 1999, a later edition of this book, Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams, was posthumously published by Acropolis Books Inc. As conveyed by the title of these dialogues, Adams considered silence to be the highest of spiritual teachings: = Advaita Vedanta = Although Adams was never initiated into a religious order or spiritual practice, nor became a renunciate, his teachings were described by Dennis Waite as being firmly based in the Vedic philosophy and Hindu tradition of Advaita Vedanta. Advaita (non-dual in sanskrit) refers to the ultimate and supreme reality, Brahman, which according to Ramana Maharshi, as interpreted by some of his devotees, is the substratum of the manifest universe, and if describable at all, could be defined as pure consciousness. Another term for Brahman is ƒÄtman. The word ƒÄtman is used when referring to Brahman as the inmost spirit of man. ƒÄtman and Brahman are not different realities, but identical in nature. Adams used a metaphor to explain this: Those in search of liberation from the manifest world will gain it only when the mind becomes quiescent. The world is in fact nothing other than the creation of the mind, and only by the removal of all thoughts, including the 'I' thought, will the true reality of Brahman shine forth. Adams taught self-enquiry, as previously taught by Sri Ramana Maharshi, in order to achieve this. = Self-enquiry = Sketch of Robert Adams in 1996. In his weekly satsangs Adams advocated the practice of self-enquiry (ƒÅtma-vichƒÅra) as the principal means of transcending the ego and realising oneself as sat-chit-ananda (being-consciousness-bliss). After acknowledging to oneself that one exists, and that whether awake, dreaming or in deep sleep one always exists, one then responds to every thought that arises with the question \\"Who am I?\\": = Four Principles of Self-Realization = Adams rarely gave a sadhana to his devotees, however, he did often have visions, and in one such vision he gave a teaching as the Buddha. He visualised himself sitting under a tree in a beautiful open field with a lake and a forest nearby. He was wearing the orange garb of a Buddhist renunciate. All of a sudden hundreds of bodhisattvas and mahasattvas came out of the forest and sat down in a semi-circle around Adams as the Buddha. Together they proceeded to meditate for several hours. Afterwards, one of the bodhisattvas stood up and asked the Buddha what he taught. The Buddha answered, \\"I teach Self-realization of Noble Wisdom.\\" Again they sat in silence for three hours before another bodhisattva stood up and asked how one could tell whether they were close to self-realization. In reply, Adams as the Buddha, gave the bodhisattvas and mahasattvas four principles, which he named The Four Principles of Self-Realization of Noble Wisdom:Godman, David (2008, June 5th), Arunachala and Sri Ramana Maharshi Blog - Robert Adams On Self- Enquiry Adi Shankara with Disciples, by Raja Ravi Varma, 1904. *First Principle: You have a feeling, a complete understanding that everything you see, everything in the universe, in the world, emanates from your mind. In other words, you feel this. You do not have to think about it, or try to bring it on. It comes by itself. It becomes a part of you. The realization that everything you see, the universe, people, worms, insects, the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, your body, your mind, everything that appears, is a manifestation of your mind. *Second Principle: You have a strong feeling, a deep realization, that you are unborn. You are not born, you do not experience a life, and you do not disappear, you do not die ... You exist as I Am. You have always existed and you will always exist. You exist as pure intelligence, as absolute reality. That is your true nature. You exist as sat-chit-ananda. You exist as bliss consciousness ... But you do not exist as the body. You do not exist as person, place or thing. *Third Principle: You are aware and you have a deep understanding of the egolessness of all things; that everything has no ego. I'm not only speaking of sentient beings. I'm speaking of the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom, the human kingdom. Nothing has an ego. There is no ego ... It means that everything is sacred. Everything is God. Only when the ego comes, does God disappear ... When there is no ego, you have reverence for everybody and everything ... There is only divine consciousness, and everything becomes divine consciousness. *Fourth Principle: You have a deep understanding, a deep feeling, of what self- realization of noble wisdom really is ... You can never know by trying to find out what it is, because it's absolute reality. You can only know by finding out what it is not. So you say, it is not my body, it is not my mind, it is not my organs, it is not my thoughts, it is not my world, it is not my universe, it is not the animals, or the trees, or the moon, or the sun, or the stars, it is not any of those things. When you've gone through everything and there's nothing left, that's what it is. Nothing. Emptiness. Nirvana. Ultimate Oneness. = Imaginative Story Teller = Although Robert Adams' stories of staying at Ramana Ashram and having personal talks with Ramana have been regarded by some as entertaining, Kitty Osborne (longtime Ashram resident) and others have noted that the stories appear to come from someone who had almost no idea about the actual situation at Ramana Ashram or Ramana‚Äôs habits. https://nothingrealized8.wixsite.com/robertadams1/integrity-451 For example Robert Adams recalls staying at the ashram for over eight months attending all of Ramana‚Äôs meetings yet was never seen, noted, or remembered by anyone who was actually there, when in actuality Westerners were always noted, written about and photographed by the Ashram, as a visit from a Westerner was highly unusual and always well documented. Robert claimed to have personal English conversations with Ramana without a translator apparently not knowing that Ramana generally never spoke English without a translator. Robert told one such story at length during his August 2, 1992 satsang about a chat at the Osborne house in which he says the two talked about various things such as self-enquiry, the maturity and sincerity of seekers, and a number of other topics. https://nothingrealized8.wixsite.com/robertadams1/integrity-451 Kitty Osborne noted the unlikelihood: Robert Adams claimed to have private personal visits with Ramana inside the Osborne house when in actuality Ramana never went inside a grihasta (householder‚Äôs) home after 1896 and did not leave the ashram front gates after 1929 except on two well noted occasions, neither of which involved going to the Osborne house. https://nothingrealized8.wixsite.com/robertadams1/integrity-451 In his Aug. 9th 1992 satsang, Robert told a story of sadhus rolling boulders down the hill from the caves above Skandashram attempting to murder Ramana, apparently unaware that there are no caves above Skandashram despite previously claiming to have lived there for years. Something that would have been noticed in minutes by anyone who was actually there. Many of Robert‚Äôs fictional stories involved money that did not take into account for the monetary inflation that happened in India between the 1940s and 1990s such as his story of Henry Wells: Apparently Robert failed to realize the unlikelihood of a Scotsman donating dollars and the fact that $40k in 1950 could have likely bought the entire town of Tiruvannamalai and most certainly would have at least been noted by someone at the ashram itself. https://nothingrealized8.wixsite.com/robertadams1/questions-for-kitty-osborne Robert claimed to have donated a jeep to the Ashram when no jeep or car was ever possessed by the ashram until 2018. http://www.wearesentience.com/biography-of-a-sage.html https://nothingrealized8.wixsite.com/robertadams1/integrity-451 According to Ed Muzika in his Yoga Journal article of Jan/Feb 1998, https://books.google.bg/books?id=JOoDAAAAMBAJ&lpg;=PA83&ots;=Xd5xyMcnRN&dq;=yoga%20journal%20the%20mysterious%20sage%20of%20sedona&pg;=PA83#v=onepage&q;=yoga%20journal%20the%20mysterious%20sage%20of%20sedona&f;=false Of course Ramana never treated anyone as special or claimed to have been waiting for them to finally arrive. Mr. Adams claimed Ramana used to cover himself with mud and tell visitors that Ramana doesn't live here anymore in order to get rid of them, when in fact Ramana never lied about anything, always was scrupulously clean, and always warmly welcomed all comers to the ashram, Pundits or not. https://nothingrealized8.wixsite.com/robertadams1/questions-for-kitty-osborne While events in many of Robert's stories were claimed to have happened to him, they could actually be found in various Hindu texts. Others were highly imaginative descriptions meant to contain some type of parable or spiritual truth which he apparently made up on the spot and told entertainingly as \\"first-person\\" accounts.

Other distinguished owners of the property included Victorien Sardou, the French dramatist and one-time mayor of the Parisian suburb of Marly-le-Roi. The Ch√¢teau du Verduron is located on Place Victorien Sardou in Marly-le-Roi, a commune in the department of Yvelines. Initially a simple one-story structure, it passed through a succession of owners following its original construction. In the early 2000s, it was purchased by SCI Le Verduron. This company commissioned COGEMAD to completely restore the building under the direction of Emad Khashoggi, who also managed the Ch√¢teau Louis XIV project in Louveciennes and the restoration of the Palais Rose in V√©sinet.  History  The history of this property is rich and complex. In the Middle Ages, the current site of the Ch√¢teau du Verduron was occupied by the . The property passed through a succession of owners. Legend has obscured details of the site's history, in part due to some confusion between J√©r√¥me Blouin and his brother Louis, the head valet of King Louis XIV. Some scholars believe that Louis XIV gave a portion of the former seigneurial domain to Louis Blouin, his head valet and the governor of Versailles and Marly, the two major royal castles of the period.Louveciennes et Marly, Victorien Sardou, 1986, p. 59. Others think that Louis Blouin acquired this property from L√©on Bierry, the king's close advisor, who also held the important financial office of contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des rentes in the H√¥tel de Ville.Marly-le-Roi et son histoire (697-1904), Camille Piton, 1904, p. 303. The GRAHAL study of 2002, which was based on notarized documents found in the National Archives and the Departmental Archives of Versailles, refer to Blouin as the owner of the property only after 1726, later than Louis XIV‚Äôs death Prior to that date, the property was occupied by the daughter of L√©on Bierry and her husband, named Fresson, who was an attorney serving in the parliament of Versailles. The couple apparently made substantial additions to the existing property. In 1722, Fresson‚Äôs heirs sold the domain to C√©sar- Pierre Landais de Soisel, Louis XIV‚Äôs councilor and secretary. He in turn provided a lifetime lease on the property to Blouin in 1726. Blouin left a strong mark on this monument‚Äôs history, whatever the precise details of his occupancy there. Described as ‚Äúthe king‚Äôs favorite‚Äù and ‚Äúthe little patron,‚Äù Blouin was considered to be a man of taste and culture. He loved to surround himself with ‚Äúeverything of distinction in the world of arts and letters.‚Äù A visitor to the property in Marly would have encountered prominent figures of the era, including Coysevox, Racine, Boileau, Girardon, and Mignard. After Blouin died in 1729, the Comtesse de Feuqui√®res, the daughter of the painter Mignard and Blouin's mistress, occupied the property until her own death in 1742.Here again, opinions diverge. It is important to make a distinction between owners and tenants, and we can no doubt find common ground between the GRAHAL study and C. Piton‚Äôs work. We refer to the latter interpretation here rather than the history of ‚Äúownership‚Äù in the legal sense of the term. The Comtesse de Vass√© purchased the property in 1751 and lived there until she died in June 1768. In 1769, the Comte de Jaucourt, the heir of the Comtesse de Vass√©, sold the ch√¢teau to Augustin-Louis-Marie Rouill√©, the chevalier and seigneur of Vaugien. That same year, Rouill√© sold the usufruct of the property to Madame de Saint-Martin, whose husband obtained the right to exploit the ice ponds in the surrounding park. Subsequently, in 1781, Rouill√©, ruined financially, also sold the bare ownership of the property to the Villemoriens. In 1784, they obtained full ownership by purchasing the rights of usufruct from the heir of the widowed Madame de Saint-Martin. Monsieur de Villemorien, the Farmer General, and his wife, herself the daughter of a Farmer General, owned land separated from the Ch√¢teau du Verduron by a road through the Forest of Marly, a royal domain. They received permission to build a covered bridge over the road and thus enlarge their property. The residence was famed for the hostess's opulent festivities and the distinguished guests who attended them, including Saint-Aubin, who immortalized these gala celebrations in his engraving Le Bal par√©. Madame de Villemorien, who had been widowed and subsequently remarried, sold the Ch√¢teau du Verduron to Charles-Michel Trudaine de la Sabli√®re in 1792. He was arrested during the French Revolution and perished on the scaffold shortly thereafter. Sixteen heirs contested the estate, particularly the property in Marly. Ultimately, Citizen Augustin d‚ÄôHerblez and his wife prevailed by purchasing the shares of the other heirs. The Ch√¢teau changed hands again in 1797, bought by Marie-Joseph Bourgouin. The unoccupied residence was imperiled until its purchase by the Parisian banker Pierre-Antoine Ravel in June 1802. An anecdote from this period tells of the hunting expedition of Napoleon Bonaparte, then the First Consul, who had the gates of the abandoned park opened so that his company could ride through the chateau's salon in pursuit of a stag. Ravel's heir sold the property one last time in 1838 to Anne-Elie-Marie de Montmorency-Luxembourg, a distant descendant of the . She occupied the properties of her ancestors under the Restoration, but only very briefly. Fearing death on the scaffold, she was bullied out of her ownership rights by her politically liberal neighbors, who were closely allied to Marly‚Äôs mayor. Upon her death, the property was retroceded by her heir to his relatives, Madame and Monsieur B√©thune-Sully. They used the ch√¢teau as a private hospital for Madame B√©thune-Sully, who suffered from dementia. In 1863, ‚Äúa wanderer, mounted on a donkey that bore him through the woods at will, suddenly had his steed halt at the edge of a broad hollow covered with an abundance of tasty thistles. Our wanderer, enchanted by the spot‚Äôs cool air and solitude, urged his mount through the lofty trees that edged the far side of the ditch, eager to discover what their dense foliage would reveal.‚Äù This ‚Äúwanderer‚Äù was none other than the dramatist Victorien Sardou. He was captivated by the place. Ardently longing to own it, he achieved his goal in August 1863. He altered the appearance of the property, filling it with his collections and the gifts bestowed on him by admirers. A celebrated playwright, he surrounded himself with a circle of performers and artists who flattered him and enthusiastically attended the lavish receptions he hosted in his residence in Marly. Victorien Sardou also became involved in the daily life of the commune of Marly, but he met his match when he attempted to organize a genuine ‚Äúcounter-revolution.‚Äù Despite this setback, he kept his beloved Ch√¢teau des Sphinx. When he died in 1908, the usufruct of the property was granted to his wife, while the bare ownership went to his four children. They recovered the right of usufruct when their mother died and sold the property to Bertrand-Louis-Eug√®ne Mir. When Mir died in 1930, his nieces inherited. At the conclusion of the division of the estate, only the Marquise de Gonet received ownership of the property. In 1940, the marquise divided the property into two lots, which she gave to her two daughters. One of the parcels was designated the ‚ÄúCh√¢teau des Sphinx‚Äù and the other the ‚ÄúOrangerie.‚Äù In 1970, the Ch√¢teau des Sphinx was sold to the insurance company AXA, which undertook the building's restoration in the 1970s. Other companies subsequently owned the residence until it was purchased by its current owner, SCI Le Verduron.  Architecture  Details of the architectural history of the Ch√¢teau du Verduron are also somewhat unclear. The original core of the building dates from 1665, and is attributed to a certain Guillaume, a well-off Parisian. This original structure was initially modified when occupied by the Fressons. According to C. Piton, a specialist in the history of Marly-le-Roi, the structure was unchanged between the time of its construction until the reign of Louis XIV, except for a few interior modifications during that king's era. However, most writers speak of a simple original core structure that was enlarged by subsequent owners. In 1720, the residence was described as a ‚Äúcountry home.‚Äù It consisted of a ground floor, a main floor, and an attic. The building was apparently enlarged during Blouin's tenancy, no doubt in accordance with the provisions of his life-time lease. Blouin was evidently authorized to transform the house ‚Äúinto a real little country chateau.‚Äù Again, there are conflicting architectural attributions. Some writers claim that Louis XIV commissioned Mansart himself to carry out the enhancements.Louveciennes et Marly, Victorien Sardou, p. 59. But this seems unlikely given the date given for the tenancy. Others believe that the alterations were based on plans by Lemoine. All agree that the dwelling boasted a ‚Äúsecond pavilion in front.‚Äù Further enlargement of the Ch√¢teau du Verduron is thought to have occurred under the ownership of the Comtesse de Vass√©. She apparently added a new residential structure adjacent to the main building. Madame de Villemorien subsequently altered the domain by connecting the Ch√¢teau du Verduron and another of her properties with a covered bridge above the road through the forest. She also restored the outbuildings. Finally, she linked the entry pavilion to the main part of the house, creating a space to serve as a library for her apparently extensive collection of books. But her single greatest transformation was the park, which had been a classically designed formal jardin √† la fran√ßaise. In contrast, she designed a more naturalistic jardin √† l‚Äôanglaise.The jardin anglais is attributed by Le Patrimoine des Communes des Yvelines to Anne-Elie-Marie de Montmorency- Luxembourg. Left abandoned and on the brink of collapse by Marie-Joseph Bourgouin, the property was restored by Pierre-Antoine Ravel, who converted it into ‚Äúa comfortable bourgeois residence.‚Äù He apparently added ‚Äúpicturesque‚Äù features to the park, including a thatched cottage and a grotto. The property suffered additional indignities after the Restoration, when it was wrested from its owner by liberal party sympathizers. Anne-Elie-Marie de Montmorency was able to recover land by buying new parcels put up for sale by the municipality. However, the park and structures were profoundly altered in the process. The next round of modifications was initiated by Victorien Sardou. He undertook some expansion and restoration work in the house, but devoted himself primarily to the park. He is to be credited for the new entrance with its monumental gate and the garden walk known as the ‚ÄúAll√©e des Sphinx‚Äù that gave the property its name of ‚ÄùCh√¢teau des Sphinx.‚Äù The impressive metal gate was given to Victorien Sardou by the Com√©die Fran√ßaise; it is a copy of the one in front of the Orangerie in Versailles. The ten granite sphinxes that line the all√©e leading from the gate to the house were purchased by Sardou from the Sultan's Pavilion in the 1867 Exposition Universelle. He also built a new Orangerie at the southwestern edge of the property. Mir once again modified the ch√¢teau's appearance by constructing a new entrance rotunda surmounted by a dome on the secondary fa√ßade. This rotunda and dome are prominent features in the current appearance of the Ch√¢teau du Verduron. SCI Le Verduron undertook a major campaign to restore the ch√¢teau, under the direction of the architect Andr√© Contenay. During the 1970s, the ch√¢teau had been completely renovated by the insurance company AXA, which then occupied the premises. As was standard practice at the time, this work was carried out at the expense of authentic decorative elements that still existed at that time. Sculpted panels, cornices, and other moldings were eliminated in favor of more contemporary d√©cor. Between 1999 and 2001, COGEMAD, under the direction of Emad Khashoggi, was commissioned to carry out a complete restoration of the Ch√¢teau du Verduron. The building recovered its former appearance, reflecting the principles of seventeenth century architecture. That era's noble materials have been restored, and the building now boasts marbles, gilding, sculpted wood paneling, parquet floors in the manner of Versailles, and fine masonry work.

Saltwater Slavery: A Middle Passage from Africa to American Diaspora. Harvard University Press, 2007. Print. is a book by Stephanie E. Smallwood and the 2008 winner of the Frederick Douglass Book Prize.\\"Frederick Douglass Book Prize\\", The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.\\"Historian Stephanie Smallwood wins Frederick Douglass Book Prize\\", UW Today, University of Washington, October 2, 2008. The book attempts to tell the story of enslaved Africans through the accounts of the Royal Africa Company (RAC) from 1675 to 1725.  Themes  = European Alteration of the Economy of West Africa = Smallwood demonstrates that Europeans altered and exploited the economy and political structure of West Africa. The market economy created by demand for slaves created an environment in the West African littoral that, for those marked for forced labor, became an inexorable march towards the slaving ships. European market demands created expansionist policies in the emerging states of West Africa. By supplying these states with guns and access to wealth, Europeans allowed certain groups to establish and maintain hegemony over other groups. These continued conflicts provided captives who were sold to European slave traders, which funded further wars and captures. = Commodification = One of the most important threads running through Smallwood's book is the process of commodification. This project begins in the introduction, where she contrasts the African slave experience with other migrant experiences: \\"In place of the networks that link origins and departures, and transform the emigrant into an immigrant, for African captives in the Atlantic system reverberated the traumatic echo of commodification\\" (18). While other immigrants are allowed to maintain links to their cultures, systems, and geographies, African slaves were deprived of all these. The commodification became complete when slaves were subjected to deprivations that tested the limits of human endurance‚Äîall in the name of maximizing profit for the RAC. Using the slave traders' ledgers, Smallwood shows how the great human drama of the slave trade was reduced to notes and \\"quantitative 'facts.'\\" These accounting instruments, packaged as they are in the form to be transmitted to headquarters in London, both conceal and reveal the underlying stories. In order to keep alive the fiction that slaving is no more messy than other forms of commodity-trading, bookkeepers needed the instruments of ledgers and quantities, and they needed to believe in the fungibility of human life. \\"People, tobacco, gold, and gunpowder, all mutually exchangeable against one another, were able to pass smoothly across transactional lines that separated one account from another\\" (84). = The Middle Passage = Another of the projects at play in Saltwater Slavery is a troubling of the very notion of the \\"middle passage\\". Smallwood closes the book with an account from a slave named Sibell, noting: > \\"Sibell's remembered experience cannot fit into the neat temporal and > spatial categories that frame my narration of the 'middle passage,' with its > orderly narrative progression from African captivity through Atlantic > commodification to American slavery...Sibell's narrative suggests that the > slave ship charted no course of narrative continuity between the African > past and American present, but rather memorialized an indeterminate passage > marked by the impossibility of full narrative closure\\" (164). To the African on a slave ship, there was nothing about the ordeal on a slave ship that implied linear progression to a known end. Rather, every moment was a rupture‚Äîa complete disintegration of previously understood experience. She calls the slaves' time on the ship an \\"experience of motion without discernible direction or destination\\" (122). Slaves had little idea where they were being taken or what was to be required of them when they arrived. Thus, to talk about the Atlantic slave ship experience as the \\"middle passage\\" does not correspond to the lived experiences of slaves themselves. = Diaspora = Smallwood reveals the stop-and-start nature of early diasporic attempts by African slaves. In the process of being removed to the Americas, slaves were deprived of the kin relations through which many African societies established the identities of their component members. Without connection to their kin structures or their ancestors' homelands, these Africans were unable to create a continuity of their lives with those of their ancestors. In addition, these Africans, especially the early slaves that Smallwood speaks of in the period 1675‚Äì1725, were unable to raise children of their own in the New World. She writes, \\"Their only heirs were those who trailed after them on the returning slave ships, to take the place of dead and departed saltwater laborers‚Ä¶\\" (160). Deprived of the ability to put down roots in the New World, these slaves were doubly robbed of identity: that of the one they left behind and that of the one they could not create in the Americas. Not until the 1720s were slaves able to raise American-born children and establish a surviving, sustainable community.  Form  Smallwood's text engages with the most fundamental difficulty for any person who attempts to write the history of the Atlantic slave trade: very few accounts of the slaves themselves are extant. Instead, we must use the accounts of Europeans in order to attempt to reconstruct the lived experiences of African slaves. Using the body of data (both numerical and anecdotal) that European slave traders left behind, Smallwood rescues some of the static \\"stages\\" used to describe the Atlantic slave trade‚Äîthe African Gold Coast, the middle passage, and the American slave market‚Äîby bringing to life the forces that defined these arenas.

His brother, Edward (1861-1949), was also a painter. He attended a trade school until 1870, then entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. His teachers included Polydore Beaufaux, Jozef Van Lerius and . In 1887, he took a study trip to Vosges and Alsace. In 1898, he visited England and spent some time at Lowestoft. When World War 1 broke out, he returned to England, via Ostend and spent the war years in Worcester Park, Surrey where he produced many landscapes and portrayals of country houses. For some unknown reason, he did not participate in exhibitions of Belgian artists in exile that were given at Kingston upon Thames and Oxford in 1915. He and his family returned to Belgium in 1919. From 1898 to 1914 he was an art teacher at the church school on Lange Leemstraat in Antwerp. He took up that position again in 1919 and remained until 1925. He was also a Professor of Drawing at the Antwerp Academy.MacConnal-Mason Gallery He died in 1929 in Remich. Work The Joke Portielje specialized in genre scenes in a variety of social settings, generally filled with people who might be described as \\"characters\\". They are often humorous (occasionally suggestive), and there is usually a sense that something is about to happen. The clothing and accessories point to the early nineteenth century, rather than his own times. He is particularly noted for his attention to fine detail. His paintings were usually priced according to the number of people they contained. He worked in close cooperation with many well-known art dealers in New York and London. One of those dealers, Albert D'Huyvetter, often had him produce paintings in collaboration with other artists. He was commissioned to create posters and brochures for the 300th Anniversary of Anthony van Dyck's birth and designed advertisements for \\"Elixir d'Anvers\\", an herbal liqueur with purported medicinal properties.

In 1986 it was added to the official ISHM listing of historical monuments. The Palais Rose in V√©sinet should not be confused with the ‚Äúother‚Äù Palais Rose, which once stood on the Avenue Foch and was razed in the early 1970s. The two buildings did however share a number of features. Both structures were designed around 1900 in the ‚ÄúGrand Trianon‚Äù style. The Palais Rose in V√©sinet was built for the shipowner Arthur Schweitzer. Some ten subsequent owners, including notables such as Comte Robert de Montesquiou and the Marquise Luisa Casati, contributed to the fame of this dwelling, organizing lavish receptions there. Various owners succeeded one another until the property was purchased by an individual. It was then comprehensively restored in the 2000s under the direction of Emad Khashoggi, head of COGEMAD, who was also responsible for the Ch√¢teau Louis XIV project in the forest of Louveciennes.  History  Following the sale of the Forest of V√©sinet to the Soci√©t√© Pallu et Cie, known as the ‚ÄúSoci√©t√© des Terrains et des Eaux du V√©sinet,‚Äù by the Ministre d‚ÄôEtat de la Maison de l‚ÄôEmpereur, the shipowner Arthur Schweitzer, cousin of Dr. Albert Schweitzer, purchased two adjacent parcels overlooking the Lac des Ibis between 1899 and 1900.The construction date of the Palais Rose in V√©sinet is not certain. La curieuse Histoire du V√©sinet suggests that the Palais Rose in V√©sinet was built before the one on Avenue Foch, and sets the date of its construction as 1897. However, most sources seem to indicate that this Palais Rose was built after the one on Avenue Foch and dates from 1899 or 1900. The GRAHAL study commissioned in 1999 was based on notarized documents and appears to be quite a reliable source. It suggests that the Schweitzer residence was built around 1900, following the couple‚Äôs purchase of the second parcel of land. He commissioned a residence in the ‚ÄúGrand Trianon‚Äù style, which he later named the ‚ÄúPalais Rose.‚Äù Schweitzer and his wife had little opportunity to enjoy the property. The shipowner declared bankruptcy and the Palais Rose was sold at auction on July 19, 1906. Ratanji Jamsetji Tata, an Indian Parsi businessman, was the winning bidder. Legend has it that he funded the purchase ‚Äúby selling two pearls and an emerald.‚Äù He never occupied his prize. However, there was no question of bankruptcy in his case. Having gotten no use from the building in two years, Tata agreed to part with it, selling the property to a man of letters who had instantly fallen in love with the Palais Rose. In 1908, the poet Robert de Montesquiou first saw the house and declared: ‚ÄúIf this house ‚Äì which is not for sale and which my modest means would never allow me to buy ‚Äì if this improbable, impossible, and nevertheless real house isn‚Äôt mine tomorrow, I‚Äôll die!‚Äù The deed of sale was signed on October 29, 1908. The house's occupancy by the Comte de Montesquiou was among the longest and best documented periods in the history of the Palais Rose in V√©sinet. The count was a stylish figure, who lived in the Palais Rose for almost twenty years until his death in 1921. A great collector, with ‚Äúa hereditary sense of magnificence,‚Äù (to quote his own words), he furnished the dwelling with an array of exotic objects. These included rich furnishings, paintings, and objets d‚Äôart. A separate building called ‚Äúl'Ermitage‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Hermitage‚Äù) was built to house his impressive collection of books. The resident of the Palais Rose was also famed for his magnificent receptions.According to La Curieuse Histoire du V√©sinet, one of the most extraordinary gatherings was held on June 12, 1912. Its fame was not due to the crowds it attracted ‚Äì on the contrary, Le Figaro had forecast bad weather. Montesquiou had organized an evening in honor of Verlaine and had staged Les Uns et les Autres with two famous actresses of the day. The preparations were worthy of a gathering at Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV. Although he enjoyed his own festivities, the Comte de Montesquiou took a dim view of the municipal celebrations organized right next to his property in the All√©e des F√™tes. He deemed these gatherings to be noisy and too ‚Äúpopular.‚Äù Although visitors were not as frequent as they had been when the poet resided in the Pavillon des Muses in Neuilly ‚Äì V√©sinet was more distant from Paris ‚Äì he still received many distinguished guests. Some were friends of the moment, or not yet well- known; others were young people mentored by the aging poet. Among them were Gabriele d‚ÄôAnnunzio, Ida Rubinstein, Claude Debussy, Colette, Rodin, Sarah Bernhardt, Maurice Rostand, Jean Cocteau and C√©cile Sorel. When Montesquiou died, all his property ‚Äì including the Palais Rose ‚Äì was left to his secretary, Henry Pinard. He sold most of the furniture and objects before selling the property itself in May 1923 to Luisa Amman, the separated wife of the Marquis de Casati.The GRAHAL study alludes to Louise Amman, alias the Marquise Casati. The website page of the Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôHistoire du V√©sinet on the Palais Rose is similarly inclined. The Revue Municipale du V√©sinet and La Curieuse Histoire du V√©sinet mention a Marquise Casati. The Revue Municipale even speaks of a Camille Casati. La Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôHistoire du V√©sinet explains that Louise Amman was the separated wife of Marquis Camillo Casati.‚Äù Fascinated by animals, Marquise Luisa de Casati collected snakes and birds. She dedicated a winter garden near the west wing's grand salon to shelter her scaly and winged prot√©g√©s. She also owned a ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù stuffed panther that leaped and emitted flashes of light. She also loved disguises and dyed her hair in an era where the practice was uncommon. Her predecessors‚Äô festive gatherings had been remarkable, but the parties given by the Marquise de Casati left their own luminous memories It is said that she arranged dinners that were illumined by nothing but bulbs she wore as a necklace. Her homage to the magician Cagliostro is also recorded in the annals. She is remembered for a costume gala based on the theme of Louis XIV‚Äôs reign. All these festivities came at a price, bringing about the marquise‚Äôs financial ruin. She was forced to abandon her furniture and home to creditors in 1934. The furnishings were sold at auction, which gave the Ch√¢teau de Versailles the opportunity to recover an enormous pink marble tub that had been purchased by Montesquiou and placed in his ‚ÄúPavillon de l‚ÄôAmour‚Äù in the garden. The house was handed over to Auguste-Eustache Lepr√©vost, a creditor of Luisa Amman (the Marquise de Casati), who was ostensibly acting on behalf of the Soci√©t√© civile du Palais Rose.Not to be confused with the current SCI Le Palais Rose. The company attempted to resell the Palais Rose to the municipality of V√©sinet. This effort failed in 1936. In order to settle the marquise's debts, the Soci√©t√© civile du Palais Rose decided to divide the domain to maximize its options, and the property was split into eight lots.This version is supported by the GRAHAL study in 1999. On this point, it contradicts the article in the Revue Municipale du V√©sinet published in 1982, where it is claimed that the division plan failed and that the Palais Rose was bought in 1938 by Olivier Scrive. Lot no. 1, comprising the Palais Rose and the Ermitage, was purchased by Olivier Scrive in 1938. Together with his family, he attempted to reconstitute the property, restoring it to the state in which it was left by the Comte de Montesquiou in 1921 by buying four additional lots. In 1948, Olivier Scrive sold the Palais Rose to the Soci√©t√© Nouvelle du Palais Rose, of which he was the majority shareholder. He kept the Ermitage for his own use. At the beginning of the Battle of France, G√©n√©ral de Gaulle, en route to take command of the Fourth Armored Division, accepted Mr. Scrive's hospitality. The general stayed at the Ermitage of the Palais Rose from May 12 to 15, 1940. A plaque mounted on the building and visible from rue Diderot commemorates this occasion. During the 1950s, the plan for the municipality of V√©sinet to purchase the property was revived by , the wife of the famous painter Maurice Utrillo. She proclaimed to anyone who would listen that the municipality was about to acquire the property for the couple's use; in exchange, they would bequeath Maurice Utrillo‚Äôs paintings to the town. Due to failures of communication between the parties concerned, the plan never came to fruition.On this subject, see La Curieuse Histoire du V√©sinet. When Olivier Scrive died in 1955, the Ermitage remained jointly owned by his heirs until they sold it in 1972 to Arnaud d‚ÄôAboville. It seems that Josephine Baker was among the ranks of potential purchasers, but she died before the sale. The Palais Rose itself, owned by the Soci√©t√© Nouvelle du Palais Rose, was sold to Maurice Blumental and Genevi√®ve Leroy in May 1981. They also bought the Ermitage in April 1982, thus almost reconstituting the property as it had been in the days of Robert de Montesquiou. The Palais Rose was purchased in the late 1990s by SCI Palais Rose. With the aim of restoring the complex, which had been registered as an historical monuments, this company requested the agency GRAHAL to perform a study. This work inaugurated an immense project during which Emad Khashoggi, heading up his company COGEMAD, completely restored and enlarged the Palais Rose. He scrupulously preserved the high quality of the site as recorded in the ISMH, the listing of regional historic monuments, on July 11, 1986.  Architecture  The name of the original architect of the Palais Rose in V√©sinet is unknown. The residence was built in the style of the Grand Trianon, and was inspired by that palace's architecture. Each subsequent owner contributed distinctive touches to the monument. Initially, when the Schweitzers were in residence, the main fa√ßade overlooking the Lac des Ibis on the east side of the building seems to have been particularly faithful to its model. Rectangular in shape, with just one level, it has two wings and a broad staircase with the same number of steps as in the one in the Grand Trianon. The facade features nine arched French windows separated by Ionic style pilasters of pink marble. There is also a similar entablature bordered by a balustrade. This ground floor consists of an enfilade of formal rooms (salons, dining room, and library). The owners‚Äô private apartments (bedroom, boudoir or antechamber, and bathroom) were on the north side. The rear fa√ßade had nothing in common with the Grand Trianon. It was built over a sub-basement and provided various service areas (kitchens, laundry room, boiler room, and servants‚Äô bedrooms). To connect the upper and lower parts of the building, there were two intermediate level areas in the structure's wings, which overlook the garden. The main floor originally had reception rooms with fifteen foot ceilings richly ornamented with boiseries and moldings. The dwelling's only master bedroom was also on this level. A very steep little staircase located in one of the halls gave access to a lower level where service areas such as the kitchen and laundry room had ceilings scarcely 7 feet high. All these lower rooms were provided with very tiny windows opening onto the garden. This architecture remained virtually unchanged until the 1980s. The modifications to the structure made by its various occupants were confined to interior decoration and redesign of the park until that date. Tata evidently made no changes to the residence or the park. This is scarcely surprising, since he never occupied the residence. Robert de Montesquiou‚Äôs influence is more in evidence. A number of interior ornaments suggest that the poet left his mark on the house. The furnishings and decorative objects played a primary role in creating a personalized atmosphere, and he also added his family coat of arms. The ‚ÄúM‚Äù that adorns the fireplace over-mantel in the grand salon is one conspicuous example. He also redesigned the park. Having purchased a pink marble tub that had served as Madame de Montespan's bath, Montesquiou built a ‚ÄúPavillon de l‚ÄôAmour‚Äù in the garden modeled after the Petit Trianon‚Äôs pavilion. He located this temple at the intersection of two perpendicular all√©es that crossed the park, making the structure the garden's principal attraction, set picturesquely amidst the green lawns and foliage.The article in the Revue Municipale du V√©sinet was particularly valuable in providing information on the alterations to the park made by the Comte de Montesquiou. It refers to an article written by Gabriel Mourey in 1913, which was published in the Gazette illustr√©e des amateurs de jardins. He also had the park adorned with statues and busts honoring French poets. Jean de La Fontaine could be found there, along with Verlaine, during the f√™te described above. In 1912, he enlarged the property with the acquisition of an additional parcel that was to become the site of the Ermitage; it was here that he built the library. The Marquise de Casati adapted the residence to accommodate her menagerie of exotic snakes. In the west wing's winter garden, she installed two heated glass cages. Perhaps regrettably, the creatures did not survive. There are also hints of the delight she took in lavish entertaining. She should probably be credited for the backlit marble and alabaster sun that decorates the floor of the grand salon. On the other hand, she evidently did not make any changes to the park; it is unclear whether she continued to use the Ermitage as a library. There were no substantial changes to the Palais Rose until it was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Blumental in the early 1980s. (At this point, it was separate from the Ermitage.) The couple commissioned the Parisian architect Jean-Louis Cardin for the work. He modified the north, south, and west fa√ßades, as well as the building's interior layout. He eliminated the mezzanine levels in the west wing, completely altering the arrangement of the rooms and remodeling the private apartment. On the exterior, he redid the balustrade, and restored the masonry, removing its gold patina. He applied stone surfacing to the base of the building to ‚Äúemphasize its massiveness, which was necessary to display the main floor to the best advantage.‚Äù When the Blumentals purchased the Ermitage in April 1982, they again commissioned Jean-Louis Cardin to carry out the restoration. In 1999, SCI Palais Rose began restoration and renovation on an unprecedented scale. The work was not completed until 2005. Emad Khashoggi, a specialist in the restoration of historic monuments, directed this project undertaken by his company COGEMAD. The very extensive work performed resulted in a number of significant modifications, while conserving the portion of the building registered in the list of historic monuments. * The ceiling height of the lower level (ground floor) was increased from less than 7 feet to almost 11 feet by lowering the floor. All the windows were enlarged and converted to double French doors. This level now houses the private apartments, which were formerly located on the upper floor. * There was additional excavation to add a basement level, lit by skylights. This area is now used as recreational space and includes an exercise room, a film theatre, a swimming pool, a game room, and a garage. * The residence was comprehensively modernized, with new electrical, heating, plumbing, and home automation systems. * The former interior decoration was restored by specialized artisans from the Monuments Historiques organization. Highly skilled gilders, sculptors, cabinetmakers, marble workers, and masons refurbished the interiors using the traditional techniques of each craft. * A monumental 270 square foot staircase now connects the various levels. * The Ermitage has been modernized and is now a freestanding three-level structure that can accommodate guest apartments.  Literary anecdotes  * The Palais Rose was used as the setting for one of the adventures of the famed gentleman thief Ars√®ne Lupin: La Cagliostro se venge. * The Palais Rose in V√©sinet has a significant role in the last novel by Camille de Peretti, published by Editions Stock in+- 2011, which tells the extraordinary tale of the Marquise de Casati.

She was known as the \\"lady crazy about film\\".Bl√°hov√°, Jind≈ôi≈°ka: Thea ƒåervenkov√°. In Jane Gaines, Radha Vatsal, and Monica Dall'Asta, eds. Women Film Pioneers Project. Center for Digital Research and Scholarship. New York, NY: Columbia University Libraries, 2013. Web. 27 September 2013. Retrieved 2014-03-19. Early life Thea ƒåervenkov√° was born to butcher's family living on Klicperova (Z√°h≈ôebsk√°) Street in Vinohrady in Prague. It is assumed that she studied abroad, possible at director Max Reinhardt's. There is no other extant evidence of her youth, connected to her private or professional life. Career At first, ƒåervenkov√° was interested in literary work. She worked for a theatre, she dramatized literary artworks, for example her dramatization of novel H≈ô√≠ch pan√≠ H√Ωrov√© by V√°clav ≈†tech was performed by Prague theatre Uranie in 1915. She wrote also a memory book, Toulky moravsk√Ωm Slovenskem, in 1917. The sources differ about the fact, when and how ƒåervenkov√° entered the film business. One version says that she shot together with her later frequent co-worker cinematographer Josef Brabec (1890‚Äì1977) a movie L√°ska a d≈ôev√°ky (Love and Wooden Shoes) as early as in 1914. But the movie is not preserved and as a director is credited only Josef Brabec. Other version is that ƒåervenkov√° and Josef Brabec founded together the film company Slavia in June 1918. After the coup for Czechoslovakian independence in October 1918, ƒåervenkov√° sold Slavia to the Austrian firm Sascha-Film but remained being director in the company. The most probable version (according to Brabec's words) is that ƒåervenkov√° got her first job in film business in Pragafilm company as a scriptwriter and editor of subtitles. There she met Brabec, who also worked for the company. After the 1918 coup, the branch renamed to Slaviafilm. At that time, Slaviafilm operated at film market as a film distributor, but soon it became also a film production company. ƒåervenkov√° helped initiate this change and became responsible for directing and scriptwriting. =Slaviafilm period= Shortly before outbreak of the coup, ƒåervenkov√° wrote for Slaviafilm her first script according to story by Jaroslav Kruis to a short movie L√°sko t≈ôikr√°t svat√° (Love Sacred Three Times, dir. Karel M. Klos, 1918). Immediately after coup, she was accused of unpatriotic behavior by press because of shooting the coup in the streets of Prague for purposes of the Austrian company. Her first movie as director was a short film comedy N√°mƒõs√≠ƒçn√Ω (Sleepwalker, 1919). After that, she wrote a story and script to comedy Ada se uƒç√≠ jezdit (Ada Learns to Drive, dir. Ada Karlovsk√Ω, 1919). In the same year she directed further short comedies or grotesques: Monarchistick√© spiknut√≠ (The Monarchist Conspiracy), Zlodƒõj (The Thief) and Byl prvn√≠ m√°j (On the First of May). Zlodƒõj and Byl prvn√≠ m√°j are the only ƒåervenkov√°'s extant films from this period. In Zlodƒõj ƒåervenkov√° also played a small role of a housemaid who was drugged by baron, whose intention was to have a free access to her landlady.official distributor text: Zlodƒõj.ƒåSFD.cz. Retrieved 2014-03-19. =ƒåervenkov√° as a journalist= During the years 1919‚Äì1920 ƒåervenkov√° contributed to trade film magazine ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω film, for example Film, jeho v√Ωznam a n√°rodnost (Film, Its Meaning and Nationality), Na≈°e filmov√° dramaturgie (Our Film Dramaturgy), Prv√° ƒçeskoslovensk√° soutƒõ≈æ na dom√°c√≠ libreta (The First Czechoslovakian Competition on National Librettos). In her articles is obvious ambition for increase the level of Czechoslovak film. She realized how important cinema could be for a nation: ‚ÄúFilm is a deep well of knowledge, film will become more influential than press, film is an art which mustn‚Äôt be profaned by flag-waving or turned into a cash cow‚Ä¶ But film is also a national credo, a declaration‚Ä¶ and this mustn‚Äôt be forgotten.‚Äù =Filmov√Ω √östav period= Conviction of the value of the film as art and the need for development ‚Äúhigher artistic film that would be adaptation of valuable literary works‚Äù led to the establishment of Filmov√Ω √∫stav. Filmov√Ω √∫stav was founded by ƒåervenkov√° and Brabec in the second half of 1919, after they left Slaviafilm. It is possible that it was caused also by change of Slaviafilm only to a distribution company. Filmov√Ω √∫stav was a family-character production company. ƒåervenkov√° built workshop, studio and laboratory in her family house in Vinohrady, in the backyard of the house were shot interiors of her movies. ƒåervenkov√° and Brabec did not have a commercial plan with their company, they only wanted to earn money for their next movies. Filmov√Ω √∫stav produced ƒåervenkov√°'s films: Babiƒçka (The Grandmother, 1921), Ko≈°ile ≈°≈•astn√©ho ƒçlovƒõka (Happy Man Shirt, 1921), Ty pet≈ô√≠nsk√© str√°nƒõ/ Bludiƒçka (The Slopes of Pet≈ô√≠n, 1922) and Paliƒçova dc√©ra (The Arsonist's Daughter, 1923). The company stood also behind documentaries about national figures and cultural features, for example Havl√≠ƒçek, jeho ≈æivot a liter√°rn√≠ v√Ωznam (Havl√≠ƒçek, His Life and Significance in Literature) and K≈ôest sv. Vladim√≠ra (Baptism of St. Vladim√≠r). Most of the documentaries were shot by ƒåervenkov√°. In Filmov√Ω √∫stav debuted also directors J.T. Shaw (Ryt√≠≈ô bled√© r≈Ø≈æe/ Knight of Light Rose, 1921) and V√°clav Wasserman (Kam s n√≠m?/ Where to with Him?, 1922). The most important ƒåervenkov√°'s movie was Babiƒçka. It was the first film adaptation of popular Czech literary classic by Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√°. But ƒåervenkov√°'s movies were not popular, neither commercially nor among critics. She was criticized mainly because of fast and low-budget production and lack of film education. But ƒåervenkov√°'s contribution to early Czechoslovak film business is obvious ‚Äì at first, as journalist who enforced perception of moviemaking as part of creating national identity, and also was one of the pioneers who adapted literary and theatre works for movies. From this period are two movies extant: Babiƒçka and Pavliƒçova dc√©ra. Filmov√Ω √∫stav finished its activities because of economic crisis in 1923. ƒåervenkov√° left to Brasil to her brother's. Since then, there is no evidence about her life and activities, either about her only son. She died in S√£o Paulo in Brazil in 1961 (or in 1957, as some sources state).

Lebanese & Syrians & Kurds accused of desertion were executed, and some 300,000 of the Lebanese & Syrians & Kurds who had stayed behind had died of famine by 1916, as Lebanon & Syria lost 75 to 90 percent of its crop production. Prostitution or cannibalism were mentioned in reports or memoirs written after the end of the war.  Terminology  The Ottoman Turkish word (seferberlik) is a compound of the Arabic noun (safar, \\"campaign\\"), the Persian suffix (-bar, \\"-carrier\\"), and the Ottoman suffix (-lƒ±k, forming abstract nouns), and refers to 'mobilization.'\\" The Modern Turkish expression has been translated into Arabic as (an-nafƒ´r al- øƒÅmm, \\"the general call to arms\\"). As explained by Najwa al- Qattan, > Originally an Ottoman Turkish term, seferberlik was part of official state > discourse referring to wartime mobilization either during the second Balkan > war or World War I which followed it. Announcements calling for mobilization > were posted in public areas in Ottoman towns and distributed to local > leaders, and the word seferberlik was prominently printed on top. Ahmen Amin Saleh Murshid, a historian of Al-Medina, and Zakarya Muhammad al- Kenisi, a historian who specialized in old Ottoman Turkish, disagree over the general meaning of the term Seferberlik. Saleh Murshid believes the term connotes the meaning of a collective deportation, especially in the context of the inhabitants of the city of Medina under the leadership of Fakhri Pasha. In addition, Saleh Murshid argues that historians should not rely exclusively on dictionaries and documents to translate Ottoman Turkish terms into Arabic. Lived experiences and popular understandings of these terms are crucial in explaining these terms.Al-Taweel, K.

History  The Seferberlik went on with resistance; young men in Lebanon & Syria did not feel related to or concerned by the rationale for Ottoman wars. When the Seferberlik was announced they sometimes hid during the process or fled during battles. As a countermeasure to the escaping from conscription or desertion from war fronts, the government sent bounty hunters to roam city streets and catch young men and deserters. It has been said that officials carried ropes with them to encircle, tie up and carry off boys and men on the run.Al-Qattan, N. (2004). Safarbarlik: Ottoman Lebanon & Syria and the Great War. In T. Philipp & C. Schumann (Eds.), in From the Lebanon/Syrian Land to the States of Syria and Lebanon The Syrian journalist Abd al-Ghani al-Utri in his book I‚Äôtirafat Shami ‚Äòatiq; sira dhattyya wa suwar dimashqiyya (translated: Confessions of an old Damascene, Biography and Damascene pictures) suggests that Syrians have sanctified bread even since the Great War. The diary of a Palestinian Ottoman soldier, Ihsan Turjman, during WWI clearly describes the scarcity of foodstuffs and the overpricing sugar, rice and grains.Tamari, S., & Turjman, I. S. (2011). Year of the Locust: A Soldier‚Äôs Diary and the Erasure of Palestine's Ottoman Past (p. 214). University of California Press. In al- Ghazzi‚Äôs book Shirwal Barhum (translated: The Pants of Barhum), during Seferberlik people were depicted as fighting over lemon and orange rinds while children pick watermelon rinds from the mud. Siham Turjman tells the account of her mother who was then 14 years old and tells that during the Seferberlik everything was expensive, people would line up in front of the bakery at midnight to buy the following morning coal-like, burnt, and overpriced bread. Seferberlik is associated with cannibalism during the war‚Äôs famine. Memoirs and reports published shortly after the end of the Great War gave an account of the horrific scenes of famine that filled Lebanon‚Äôs streets. In Antun Yamin‚Äôs Lubnan fi al-Harb--a two-volume history published in 1919‚Äî a section entitled \\"Stories that Would Shake Rocks\\" gives a detailed report of moments when people attacked corpses of dead animals and children and ate them.

In his diary entry for April 29, 1915, a common soldier in the Ottoman military headquarters in Jerusalem, Ihsan Turjman (1893‚Äì1917), mentioned his encounter with a prostitute in the streets of the city, the sight of whom filled him with concern for all the women who \\"found that they could not survive without prostituting themselves.\\" Yusuf Shalhub, the famous Zajal poet, lamented the deterioration of living conditions during the War, which led many women to sell their bodies in exchange for bread. = Seferberlik in Medina (Saudi Arabia) = In Medina's memory of the war, Seferberlik refers to the collective deportation of the city's inhabitants by the famous Hijaz train. According to current research on the topic in Medina, Seferberlik for the original inhabitants of the city invokes memories of humiliation and the destruction of social and familial structure.ŸÖÿ±ÿ¥ÿØ, ÿß. ÿ£. ÿ£., & ÿßŸÑÿ∑ŸàŸäŸÑ, ÿß. ÿß. ÿÆ.

According to the same source, only 140 people remained in the city and they suffered from food shortages caused by the Ottoman military leader Omar Fakhr eddin, also known as Fakhri Pasha.  Seferberlik in Arabic literature, filmography, and historiography  Seferberlik and the memories associated with it constitute an important element in Arabic literature. Poets and Authors whose parents endured the hardships associated with the Seferberlik received first-hand accounts of war experience and the means by which the war impacted the society in Greater Syria. These authors and poets have used the material of the Seferberlik in various contexts. Some authors used it in novels such as Nadia Al-Ghazzi, Hanna Mina...etc. In addition to the literature, authors of cities or villages popular history during the early 20th century mentioned the Seferberlik in regards to the war, and it was depicted as an essential event in the history of this period. A substantial amount of historical books were produced, including ·π¨arƒÅ ºif wa-·π£uwar min tƒÅrƒ´kh Dimashq (Anecdotes and pictures from the history of Damascus) by HƒÅnƒ´ Khayyir and Siham Turjman's book Ya Mal el-Sham (The Daughter of Damascus). Novelists, journalists, and playwrights used the oral accounts of those who lived and experienced WWI, and the miseries of the Seferberlik that they described to produce an impressive body of literary and drama production. The Seferberlik scenes report on the miserable circumstances people lived through. In the 20th century Arabic's literature and Arab history accounts of the period the Seferberlik became a synonym for the famous famine that overran the Levant, especially Mont Lebanon, in 1916 during World War I. In the same context, the term Seferberlik was used to refer to the event of the war itself. In Siham Turjma‚Äô s book Daughters of Damascus chapter on \\"The Seferberlik,\\" tells the memories of her father who, according to his tale, was conscripted \\"to go to the Seferberlik\\" i.e. the war and worked as a telegrapher and communication officer on the front lines. Also Abdul Fattah Qal'aji wrote his book Urs ·∏§alabƒ´ wa-hikƒÅyƒÅt min Safar Barlik (Aleppine wedding and stories from the Seferberlik). The Seferberlik in this book is a synonym for the war and its events. The Seferberlik has also emerged as a theme in Arab films and television programming. The Lebanese Rahbani brothers produced the war film Safar Barlik in the 1960s. The Syrian drama series Ikhwat al-Turab (Brothers in Soil), directed by Najdat Anzour in the 1990s, shows soldiers being separated from their families and loved ones because of the Seferberlik.

The film serves as the inspiration and pilot for the miniseries Over the Garden Wall, which premiered in 2014. In the filmwhich is narrated by Warren BurtonWirt (Elijah Wood), his brother Gregory (Collin Dean), and Beatrice (Natasha Leggero), a bluebird, head to the big city in search of an arcane book of all known things, meeting a vegetable man along the way. McHale initially pitched the idea to Cartoon Network as a three- season television series, but was asked to develop it into a feature film for Cartoon Network's planned feature film department. He had trouble rewriting the series into a feature, and it was ultimately put on hold when McHale went to work on Adventure Time. Several years later, Cartoon Network asked McHale for another pitch. He reworked his pitch for Tome of the Unknown, which was accepted as a pilot and made into a short film. Released in 2013 to multiple film festivals, Tome of the Unknown has received several accolades. Plot synopsis In a large forest simply called the \\"Unknown,\\" Wirt and his brother Gregory walk with Beatrice (Natasha Leggero; later voiced by Melanie Lynskey in the miniseries), a bluebird who has gained the ability to speak. The three are on their way to the big city, in search of a book titled The Tome of the Unknown, which ‚Äì according to legend ‚Äì contains every forgotten thing. When their legs tire, Greg suggests they ride a goose, but Wirt doubts they could find one big enough to carry them. Greg wanders off and discovers a car made from vegetables, which fascinates and confuses Wirt. The car's owner, John Crops (C. W. Stoneking), is likewise a vegetable humanoid. Crops wallows over his loneliness, wishing like the others to go the city. Wirt offers, in exchange for Crops letting them keep the car, to drive Crops to the city, where he can hopefully find a soulmate. A murder of giant crows attacks the vegetable car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer off into a cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops reveals that they have arrived at the \\"big city,\\" which turns out to be an old-fashioned small farm community in the middle of the cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops to explore the city's gazebo garden party, where Crops bumps into a woman made of cabbage. An announcement declares that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled, and Greg suggests that Crops should perform instead. The cabbage woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Meanwhile, Wirt has trouble fixing the vegetable car until Beatrice tells him what to do. When they start the engine and try to leave, they knock over the scarecrow. This summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman, unaware of the chaos around him. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg jumps out of the car and wanders into the cornfield, where he finds a goose big enough for the group to ride. Wirt and Beatrice find him soon after, guided by his loud, happy screaming. Greg's screams scare off the birds, and Crops returns home with the cabbage woman. Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and their new companion Goose, continue to travel onwards, deeper and deeper, into the Unknown. Production Patrick McHale, the film's director Tome of the Unknown is a short film written and directed by Patrick McHale, who also wrote and storyboarded it. Not long after he graduated from college, McHale pitched the idea for the film, among other concepts, to Cartoon Network. At the time, the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films, though this never came to fruition. McHale was asked if it was possible to adapt the idea for Tome of the Unknown to feature length. This proved unsuccessful as he felt it needed to be episodic, laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons. The project was placed on the backburner when McHale was recruited as creative director for Pendleton Ward's Adventure Time, also a Cartoon Network production. Several years later, around 2011, the network asked McHale to pitch an idea. Although he had made several short student films and had worked in animation for other people, he had never created a professional piece of his own. As a result, McHale did not anticipate the network to have it go further than the short. The short was positively received and was accepted for production into a miniseries. Initially conceived as an eighteen-episode miniseries, time constraints forced the series to be cut down to only ten episodes. The plot was retooled from the pilot and retitled Over the Garden Wall, and announced in May 2014. Nick Cross, who worked as a background painter with layout designer Chris Tsirgiotis on Tome of the Unknown, was hired as the art director for the series. Release and reception Cartoon Network released Tome of the Unknown to several film festivals starting in 2013, including the 20th anniversary of the Austin Film Festival on October 24, 2013, and the International Children's Film Festival at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in May 2014. At the Ottawa International Animation Festival, the film won an honorable mention as one of the best short animations for children on September 21, 2013. A Bruce Corwin Award for animation was given to the film at the 29th annual Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February 2014, where it was screened in the previous month. Regarding its screening in Boston, Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe called the film marked by the presence of connections by celebrities, particularly Wood, while noting McHale for his work on Adventure Time. The film saw digital distribution as part of the DVD release of the miniseries on September 8, 2015. The network previously released the film on their official website in May 2015. R√≥bert Kov√°cs-Cohner of the Hungarian IGN gave it a high recommendation, calling the story beautiful as it occurs over the backgrounds. For their work on these backgrounds, Cross and Tsirgiotis earned juried Emmy Awards, as part of the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

During the late 1920s, as deputy head of the Palestinian Department of Health, Dr Macqueen was involved in the establishment of the first infant welfare centres in Jerusalem's Old City and Bethlehem. It was part of a government program to reduce infant mortality which at that time was 201.27 per 1,000 births. By 1929 there were 27 such centers across the country, mostly funded by non-government bodies. Macqueen complained about the absence of financial support from municipalities, specifically Bethlehem and Bayt Jala.Shepherd, Naomi (1999) Ploughing Sand. British Rule in Palestine 1917-1948.

Trachoma affected more than 60% of the population, with many sufferers being treated by the St Johns Eye Hospital, Jerusalem. Leprosy was disappearing, and there were vaccines for the other infectious diseases found in Palestine: rabies, cholera and smallpox.

Another area of concern was the lack of care for mental patients. There was only an asylum in Bethlehem and a section of Acre prison being maintained by the state; a total of around 160 beds. In 1942 there was a critical fall in conditions in privately run mental hospitals in Tel Aviv when the municipality stopped funding them.

Four months later, the network passed on the series as it did not fit their target demographic; it was soon after picked up by Fox Broadcasting Company. Boomer based the series on his own life. He called the central family a \\"gigantically exaggerated and self- serving version\\" of his family and childhood: \\"My mother was very no-nonsense [...] Who could blame her? She was working while trying to keep up with four destructive and always hungry boys.\\" = Casting = The title character Malcolm was initially written as being nine years old. While auditioning, the- then 13-year old Frankie Muniz thought that he would not get it, believing he was \\"too old\\". However, the producers were impressed with Muniz, so he was cast, and the character was aged up. In the season, Malcolm's age is intentionally not mentioned, with the revelation only that he attends middle school, \\"not the actual grade level.\\" Aaron Paul was interested in auditioning for the role of Malcolm's eldest brother Francis, but the producers were not interested in casting him; the role went to Christopher Kennedy Masterson, who was cast after a single audition. Jane Kaczmarek initially did not want to play the matriarch of the family Lois, even after receiving the script, but then wondered, \\"Wow, they really love me [...] Maybe I should read this.\\" After reading the script, she found that \\"there was something undeniably quirky and endearing about Lois\\", so she accepted. Justin Berfield was cast as Malcolm's older brother Reese, despite Berfield being younger than Muniz, while Erik Per Sullivan was cast as the youngest brother Dewey, and Catherine Lloyd Burns as Malcolm's teacher Caroline Miller. The character of Hal, the patriarch of the family, was initially underwritten, and described by Boomer as \\"a writer's conceit that just lay there on the page like a turd\\". During Bryan Cranston's audition for the part, he had to simply be \\"listening to a fight between the mom and one of her sons\\" as required. At that time, Cranston put a pipe in his mouth and watched the fight, causing Boomer to fall from his chair while laughing. Boomer recalled that Cranston \\"just had this vast inner life going on.\\" He described Cranston's look at that time as a man who \\"looks like he's listening, but he's actually building a rocket ship in his head\\", and Cranston was cast immediately. = Filming = Much of the filming for the season was done on location. Unlike other sitcoms, the makers avoided including laugh tracks or studio audience, and cinematography was done with single-camera to achieve a more \\"cinematic look\\". A privately owned home, located at 12334 Cantura Street in Studio City, California, was rented for upwards of $3,000 a day to film as Malcolm's house. School scenes were filmed at Colfax Elementary School. For the episode \\"Rollerskates\\", Cranston learned how to skate and performed most of his skating scenes, while a stunt double was used for the more complicated skating scenes. During \\"The Bots and the Bees\\", he wore a suit of live bees as required for the role. He was covered in 10,000 bees, but only got stung once, during which he did not flinch. In \\"Stock Car Races\\", when Hal and the boys are entering a race track, the billboard behind the entrance displays the place as Irwindale Speedway, a real race track in Southern California. The season finale was filmed at a water park called Wild Rivers located in Irvine, California.

He developed a model for training aircrew during World War II. In 1949 he became the first chair of the National Trades Certification Board. Early life Caradus was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1885. His paternal grandparents, James and Elizabeth Caradus, had emigrated to New Zealand in 1842 on the ships Jane Gifford and Duchess of Argyle. Between 1897 and 1902 Caradus was educated at Auckland Grammar School, where he won a scholarship to attend Auckland University College. In 1904, while at university, Caradus was awarded the Sir George Grey Science Scholarship in chemistry. He graduated from Auckland University College with a Bachelor of Science in 1906. Caradus joined the Waihi Grand Junction Gold Mining Company in Waihi as an analytical chemist in 1906, but in 1908 decided to pursue a career in education. George Douglas Robb was one of his early pupils and commented in his autobiography that chemistry, presented by Caradus in a didactic way, fired his imagination.Medical odyssey, Sir George Douglas Robb, Collins, 1967, page 15 Caradus taught at Wellington College from 1909 to 1913 before becoming senior science master at Auckland Grammar School (1913‚Äì22) and first assistant at Nelson College (1922‚Äì26). He was appointed an inspector of secondary schools in 1926. In 1937 he was promoted to senior inspector and in 1941 he became the chief inspector of secondary schools. Caradus was a member of the University Entrance Board and assisted the University of New Zealand to review the results of University Entrance and University Entrance Scholarship examinations. He later made study of examination procedure and technique in relation to the New Zealand University Entrance examinations, which was published in about 1960. World War II In 1938 Caradus was the educational advisor to the Air Department. In 1942, during World War II the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) appointed Caradus as its director of educational services with the rank of wing commander, while he also continued to work as senior inspector of secondary schools. Caradus was charged with the responsibility of ensuring a steady flow of appropriately educated young men, who would go on to train as aircrew with the RNZAF and the RAF. In 1941 he was appointed chief inspector of secondary schools, but in 1943 the government decided his position of director of educational services was required on a full-time basis, and he was placed on leave from his chief inspector's role for the duration of the war. Many potential pilots and navigators did not have the required education, but a lowering of standards would have been dangerous. Caradus devised and prepared a pre-entry course of educational training which covered elementary navigation, mathematics, elementary science and some service subjects. After a few weeks, however, it was found that men who were nominally up to standard were at a disadvantage on entering their service training in comparison with those who had done the pre-entry course. It was therefore decided that all except those with very high qualifications should take the course. The scheme was a great success and saw a vast increase in the number of graduates. The importance of the aircrew pre-entry education scheme to New Zealand's war effort was acknowledged by the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser. The scheme was adopted by the Royal Australian Air Force and served as a model for similar schemes in Britain and other countries of the then British Empire. Throughout his time in this position Caradus was also a member of the RNZAF Aircrew Selection Committee. By mid-1944 the focus of Caradus' role had changed from initial training to rehabilitation of returning airmen and sailors to the normal workforce. Royal New Zealand Navy personnel had also been brought under Caradus' purview. In the 1946 New Year Honours, Caradus was appointed an Officer of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire. Later life After the war Caradus resumed his position as chief inspector, secondary schools. At the same time, Caradus continued to act as director of educational services for the RNZAF, when required. He held both positions until his retirement in 1948. He also continued to represent the air force and naval interests on the education committee of the Rehabilitation Board. In November 1946 Rex Mason, Minister of Education, set up a consultative committee to examine the Education Department's technological examinations. There had been problems with these for some time and a fresh approach had become necessary. Caradus was appointed committee chair. The committee consisted of six educationalists and six industry representatives. The committee recommended setting up a National Trades Certification Board. The Government adopted the committee's recommendation and Caradus was appointed first chairman of the board in 1949. In 1947, while attending a science conference in Perth, Australia, Caradus was invited by A.J. Gibson to address a royal commission into management, control and working of an Australian mechanical workshop. During his retirement, Caradus taught chemistry for two years part-time at Wellington East Girls' College, and was on the boards of several organisations, such as the Rehabilitation Board, the Wellington Hospital Board and the Horowhenua Power Board. In 1957, Caradus came out of retirement and accepted the position of Headmaster at Scots College, Wellington, New Zealand, for a period of two years. The Caradus Shield for the winners of the annual best house competition was named in his honour. Caradus died on 15 February 1969, and his ashes were buried in Karori Cemetery, Wellington.

History of the terms  The posthumous names of the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE) founders, King Wen and King Wu, represent the two terms as standing in the \\"father-and-son\\" relationship. Since the conquest of Shang and creation of the Zhou imperial order were the most discussed events of the classical era, the two impersonated terms had very broad currency. However, their origin is presently impossible to pinpoint.McNeal, 13-14.

Should you possess the civil but lack the > martial, you will have no means to awe those below. Should you possess the > martial but lack the civil, the people will fear you but not draw close.

He finished his secondary studies in P√©cs, where he joined Royal Hungarian Honv√©d as a volunteer. He became a reserve Lieutenant at 44th Regiment. After that he attended Hochschule f√ºr Bodenkultur in Vienna, then he went on an economical study tour to abroad.

Tisza assassination attempt Former Prime Minister (1903‚Äì1905) and incumbent legislative speaker (1912‚Äì1913) Istv√°n Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian Army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. In contrast, Independence Party was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Hungarian language of command in the army). Tisza strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the police force to force out numerous opposition representatives, including Kov√°cs. Tisza managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal of some members of the opposition party on 4 June 1912. As a result, the enraged Kov√°cs, attempted to assassinate Tisza in the Hungarian Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. He had yelled, while jumped off the journalists' gallery: \\"There is still a member of the opposition!\\", and fired three times at Tisza. His shots, however, missed and the marks are still visible in the Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov√°cs tried to kill himself, but he survived without a permanent head injury.Tisza, Katolikus lexikon, Budapest, 1933 Tisza then continued the session. Later, Kov√°cs was tried but acquitted, referring to \\"deeper disturbance of consciousness\\".P√∂l√∂skei, Ferenc: Tisza Istv√°n. Gondolat Kiad√≥, Budapest, 1985. p. 160.

His sister, Lady Isa Louise Bennet, was married to John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie. His elder brother, Charles, Lord Ossulton, the heir apparent, died, unmarried, of cholera in India 29 June 1879, while serving with the Rifle Brigade.

At that time, California educational law prohibited Native American children from attending a public school if a separate government run Indian school was established within three miles of the public school. Alice Piper along with six other Indian children sued the district for the right to attend. Piper sued on the grounds that her 14th Amendment rights had been violated knowing full well that she was not receiving the same education that the newly built public school afforded. The local Indian day school only offered education up to the 5th grade level, was underfunded, and lacked many basic resources. Furthermore, the District trustees had previously agreed to allow Indian students to attend the school if their parents voted for a measure that would fund the construction of the school. Although the measure passed, the board of trustees did not honor their agreement. As a local resident recalled, \\"It was an exciting morning when the request was made, all the mothers and fathers of children of school age, Indian and white, were on the street to hear the answer of the district trustees. When the request was denied, the Indians immediately took court action pressing their case in the name of Alice Piper, a beautiful, intelligent, Indian girl.\\" Inyo Independent. May 10, 1946. The California Supreme Court unanimously ruled in her favor in the case Piper v. Big Pine (1924), thus opening the door for herself and other Native American children to attend public schools in the state of California. Legacy Piper's court victory became a turning point in the struggle for Native American education and ended the practice of sending Indian children who qualified for public school to separate government-run Indian day schools. Piper v. Big Pine was later cited by Chief Justice Warren as a precedent in the Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ruling that ended the practice of segregated schools in the United States.Blalock-Moore, Nicole. Piper v. Big Pine School District of Inyo County: Indigenous Schooling and Resistance in the Early Twentieth Century . Alice Piper stands as an early civil rights hero who championed equal educational opportunities for Native Americans, opening the door for equal access to education for all children regardless of race. Says Ada Wardle Robinson, the Inyo County Superintendent who held the office years after the Piper case decision had been handed down, \\"And as each year as both eighth grade and high school students graduate, we are reminded that the development of our youthful citizens is not confined to the white race and we are thankful to those Indians who years ago insisted that their children be given an equal chance.\\" In 2009, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe and Big Pine Unified School District agreed to commemorate Piper's victory with a statue placed in front of the school in her honor. The statue was dedicated on June 2, 2014, on the 90th anniversary of Alice Piper's victory in front of the school steps on the same ground in which the board of trustees had denied Alice Piper the right to attend in 1923. This date also marks the day in 1924 that president Grover Cleveland signed the Indian Citizenship Act, which declared all Indians, regardless of membership in a tribe, citizens of the United States. As of 2014, 56% of the students who attend Big Pine high school are Native American. Alice Piper, (~age 15).

Early life Zena Rommett was born Angelina Buttignol on May 19, 1920 in the Veneto Region, Italy and immigrated to America with her mother in 1925. Zena's father, Antonio, had immigrated to America two years earlier. The family settled together in Elmsford, New York. Rommett studied ballet with leading ballet teachers in New York City, including Anatole Vilzak, Chester Hale, Ludmilla Schollar, and Elisabeth Anderson-Ivantzova. Professional dance career Rommett began her professional career as a member of an adagio dance trio. She performed with the U.S.O. during World War II. She made her Broadway debut in December 1944 in the original cast of Billy Rose's \\"Seven Lively Arts\\" with major ballet numbers choreographed by Anton Dolin. She danced in Broadway musicals \\"Song of Norway,\\" choreographed by George Balanchine, and \\"Paint Your Wagon,\\" choreographed by Agnes de Mille. Rommett's aspirations soon turned to pedagogy and she was invited by Robert Joffrey to teach at his American Ballet Center in New York City in 1965. Her combined teaching experience and professional dance background inspired her to create her unique Floor-Barre method for training and rehabilitating dancers. Dance school In 1968, Zena Rommett Dance Association, aka Zena Rommett Floor-Barre Foundation, was founded by Rommett and founding board members Robert Joffrey and Howard Squadron, and Rommett founded her own school which was located at 70 West Third Street, in New York City. The school became Rommett's laboratory for developing the Floor-Barre, as she helped ballet, modern, jazz and musical theatre performers to overcome injuries and develop and refine their technique. Rommett discovered that working with the legs in a parallel position was an effective way to train and correct a dancer's placement. Rommett explained that \\"one day to experiment I had the students bring their legs into parallel. Then and there I discovered the beautiful secret of my technique. By working in parallel, I could correct the body alignment for a perfect turnout.\\" Rommett later said that \\"when you work in parallel on the floor, the connection of the ankle to knee to hip is so correct that the leg remains aligned when you turn out again\\" and cautioned that \\"it must be done meticulously to be effective.\\" Floor-Barre technique Rommett conceived and developed her technique by bringing dancers away from a traditional ballet barre and onto the floor to do their dance training exercises. By taking the effort of standing out of the equation, Rommett's technique took the weight-bearing pressure off the ankles, knees, and hips. Rommett's application of ballet barre exercises performed using the floor as the source of support became known as the Floor-Barre, the first approach of its kind. Floor-Barre enables the practitioner to efficiently and effectively strengthen joints and muscles, correct alignment, release tension, and prevent and rehabilitate injuries. Known for her \\"patient, persuasive, and quiet voice,\\" Rommett's quiet directed movements create a rhythmic flow which stills and focuses the mind and centers the body. This technique facilitates the development of beautiful lines, smooth transition and fluidity of movement. \\"What I do,\\" said Rommett, \\"is define, refine, and fine-tune movements so that they can be performed more correctly and easily. The muscles become lengthened and strengthened, and energy is not dissipated but directed. It all comes from the basics taught in a pure manner.\\" Rommett and her daughter, Camille Rommett, began offering annual teacher certification courses in 1998 and today her Floor-Barre Technique continues throughout the world by devoted teachers who have been certified to teach Rommett's technique. In 2006 Floor-Barre was trademarked. Camille Rommett continues Rommett's work as the Executive Director of the Zena Rommett Floor-Barre Foundation and orchestrates two Floor-Barre certification courses each summer in Europe and New York City. Notable students Rommett's teaching style drew students from all over the world. Rommett's students were dancers, musical theatre artists, athletes and non-dancers. Some notable students of Zena Rommett were Melissa Hayden, Tommy Tune, Patrick Swayze, Judith Jamison, Lar Lubovitch, John Curry, and Ulysses Dove. Ms. Hayden and Ms. Jamison have said that Rommett's Floor-Barre was critical to their rehabilitation following severe injuries. Family Rommett was married to artist Alexis Nicoli Romanovich. They had two daughters, Melissa Romanovich and Camille Rommett Mouquinho. Zena's husband died in 1968. Robert Joffrey gave Zena the surname Rommett in 1965. Some other family members also adopted the surname Rommett. Final years Rommett taught Floor Barre classes at Steps Studio in New York up until three months before her death. On November 10, 2010, Rommett died of cancer at the age of 90.

The volcanic character of the Araratian peak and its earthquakes may have suggested its association with the Vishap. Sometimes with its children, the Vishap used to steal children or toddlers and put a small evil spirit of their own brood in their stead. According to ancient beliefs, the Vishap ascended to the sky or descended therefrom to earth, causing thunderous storms, whirlwinds, absorption of the sun (causing an eclipse). The dragon was worshipped in a number of Eastern countries, symbolising the element of water, fertility and wealth, and later became a frightful symbol of power. According to ancient legends, the dragon fought Vahagn the Dragon Slayer.

Opened in 1936, the restaurant is located in downtown Bend and is one of the city's best known landmarks. The main dining room was built around two large ponderosa pine trees for which the restaurant is named. Both the main dining room and the restaurant's outdoor garden dining area overlook the Deschutes River. Today, the Pine Tavern is the oldest restaurant in the city of Bend.  History  In 1919, Maren Gribskov and Eleanor Bechen opened a restaurant in downtown Bend called the O.I.C Cafeteria.\\"Bend Business Changes Hands\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 7 December 1967, p. 55.Morris, Elizabeth, and Mark Morris, \\"Bend\\", Moon Handbooks Oregon (seventh edition revised by Judy Jewell and Bill McRae), Avalon Travel Publishing, Emeryville, California, p. 432. In 1936, the two partners decided to move to a new location overlooking Mirror Pond on the Deschutes River. They named the new restaurant the Pine Tavern because of two large ponderosa pine trees that grew in the middle of the restaurant's back patio.\\"History of the Pine Tavern Restaurant\\", Pine Tavern Restaurant, Bend, Oregon, 15 March 2014.Anderson, John Gottberg, \\"Restaurants: Best outdoor dining\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 1 June 2012.\\"The pine in Pine Tavern At more than 150 years old, famous tree is in reasonable health\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 9 November 2013. Despite the economic hardships caused by the Great Depression, the Pine Tavern was a success, especially popular with local timber workers and their families. During World War II, the restaurant became popular with soldiers from nearby Camp Abbot. After the war, word-of-mouth recommendations brought tourists, travelers, and skiers to the Pine Tavern. In 1957, a major renovation expanded the dining area, incorporating the two giant pine trees into a new dining room. In 1967, the Pine Tavern was sold to Dallas \\"Tex\\" Carter, a retired furniture manufacturer from Tacoma, Washington. In the early 1970s, Carter sold the restaurant to Winifred Roley. She operated the Pine Tavern for a decade before selling it to Bert Bender and Joe Cenarrusa in 1982. Bender was an experienced restaurateur, having operated well-known dining establishments in Sun Valley and Ketchum, Idaho, before taking over the Pine Tavern. In the 1990s, Bender and Cenarrusa redesigned the garden and patio dining area that overlooks the Deschutes River. Cenarrusa was killed in an airplane crash in 1997. However, Bender continued to operate the restaurant until his death in 2009.Doran, Tim, \\"New owner knows restaurant well Pine Tavern's Justine Bender Bennett has been involved since childhood\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 7 December 2010. After Bender died, his wife, Christine, and his daughter, Justine Bender Bennett, took charge of the Pine Tavern. In 2010, the front dining area was remodeled, removing a large booth and replacing it with tables to open up the interior space. In the following year, bathrooms were renovated and the interior was updated with new carpet and upholstery.  Landmark  Garden patio overlooking Mirror Pond The Pine Tavern is the oldest restaurant in the city of Bend. According to the Bend Bulletin newspaper, the restaurant's success is the result of its unique character, picturesque location, and long-standing reputation for good service and quality cuisine.Johnson, Julie, \\"Pine Tavern dishes up taste of Bend history\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 31 December 2002.Anderson, John Gottberg, \\"Bend's Pine Tavern still going after 74 years\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 27 August 2010. The two large ponderosa pines in the restaurant's main dining room give diners the feeling of being in an outdoor terrace with a view of the Deschutes River from large windows on three sides. The smaller of the two pine trees that are the centerpiece to the Pine Tavern's main dining room, was killed by mountain pine beetles in 1983. The lower part of that tree's trunk still rises through the dining room roof, giving the impression of a living tree. However, the upper part of the tree has been removed. The larger pine tree is estimated to be up to 300 years old. It is healthy and still rises through the roof of the main dining room to tower above the restaurant. The Pine Tavern's garden overlooks Mirror Pond, an impoundment of the Deschutes River. The garden's brick patio is open for dining in the summer. The garden area is covered by maple and birch trees and landscaped with hostas and geraniums. There is also a large birdhouse built to look like the Pine Tavern in a corner of the garden. Dining in the garden area is very popular with both tourists and local guests. Over the years, the Pine Tavern has been a popular venue for special events. It has hosted local civic groups,\\"AAUW Sets Bend Forum\\", News for and about Women, The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 20 April 1964, p. 27.\\"Bend Plans Celebration\\", Citizen-Veteran News, The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 17 October 1937, p. 7. wedding receptions and anniversary dinners,\\"MacPherson-Rademacher\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 10 May 1966, p. 12. political gatherings,Hauser, Paul, \\"Douglas McKay Appear At Lord‚Äôs Acre Auction\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 4 November 1956, p. 20.\\"Victory Seen By Morgan\\", Society News Section, The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 3 October 1954, p. 2. museum fund raising events,\\"Dinner Benefits Museum\\", Sunday Oregonian Magazine, The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 14 May 1982, p.

Menu  The Pine Tavern's menu is based on locally produced foods and ingredients. For example, prime rib and the flat iron steaks served at the restaurant are from Oregon Country Beef, a Central Oregon ranching operation that raises hormone-free cattle. The restaurant's lamb is from a sheep ranch near Shaniko, Oregon, north of Bend. Their salmon is line-caught chinook from the Columbia River. The chef uses Oregon hazelnuts for the crust on brie appetizers while pears, apples, and marionberries served in various dishes are from Pacific Northwest orchards and berry farms. As a result, the Pine Tavern's menu helps to support local ranchers and farmers as well as serving dinner guests.  Location  The Pine Tavern is in downtown Bend, Oregon. It is at the end of Oregon Avenue with Brooks Street passing in front of the restaurant. The front of the Pine Tavern looks directly up Oregon Avenue while the back overlooks Mirror Pond.Pratt, Gerry, \\"Bend Finds Winner In Recreation Boom\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 7 March 1967, p. 16.

Once an important port on the Mississippi River, nothing remains of the original settlement. History The town was founded in 1820 by C. L. Moore, who operated a ferry to Helena, Arkansas, located on the opposite side of the river. The site was called \\"Glendale Landing\\" until 1846, when Captain John Trotter bought land there and changed the name to \\"Trotter's Landing\\". Trotter Landing was a busy riverport where agricultural products were produced and transported downriver. The town's importance, however, did not grow beyond that of a riverport. In 1870, the Ohio Statesman reported that the steamboat Kenton, traveling from Cincinnati to New Orleans, struck a snag at Trotter Landing and was lying on its side on the river bank. The steamer was \\"probably a total loss\\". Trotter Landing was the terminus of a branch of the now-abandoned Mobile & North Western Railroad, constructed in the 1870s. The line traveled west to Trotter Landing from Lula, Mississippi. The 1910 Glidden Tour--an annual cross-county driving event sponsored by the American Automobile Association--crossed the \\"Father of Waters\\" at Trotter Landing. The Board of Trade in Helena sent large barges to the town to carry all the vehicles, and a portion of the levee had to be temporarily cut away. In 1915, the ferry from Trotter Landing to Helena was included as part of the route of the Southern National Highway. Decline Factors contributing to the demise of Trotter Landing's included the widespread construction of railways following the American Civil War, which greatly reduced the reliance on the Mississippi River as a method of transportation. The need for ferry crossings on the river was also impacted by bridge construction, such as the Frisco Bridge in nearby Memphis, opened in 1892. The Mississippi River, moreover, changed course and moved west of the Trotter Landing, leaving the town some distance inland from the river. Today Trotter Landing is significant to canoeists and paddlers on the Mississippi River. The town was located at the entrance to \\"Old River Chute\\", a historic oxbow lake described as \\"a primeval world \\", accessible by small water craft from the Mississippi River.

As a true freshman in 2010, Easley played sparingly, playing in six games and totaling four tackles. In 2011, he started all 12 regular-season games, before suffering a torn ACL against Florida State. He recorded a total of 37 tackles on the season, finishing tied for fifth on the team with 7.5 tackles for a loss. In 2012, he played in and started eleven games, missing two games due to injury. He collected 26 tackles on the season, including 8.5 tackles for a loss and a team leading four quarterback sacks, while adding a fumble recovery. In 2013, Easley's senior season was cut short after tearing his ACL in practice leading up to the Kentucky game. He totaled five tackles, including two for a loss. On September 30, 2013, just a few days after it was reported he would miss the rest of the college football season, Easley announced he would forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the NFL Draft. Professional career =New England Patriots= Easley was selected by the New England Patriots in the first round (29th overall) of the 2014 NFL Draft. The team signed him to a four-year contract on June 23, 2014. According to Ian Rapoport, the contract is for $7.3 million. On September 7, 2014, Easley played in his first NFL regular season game, a 33‚Äì20 road loss to the Miami Dolphins. He would record his first career interception (off former Patriot Matt Cassel) the following week during a 30‚Äì7 win over the Minnesota Vikings. On December 17, the Patriots placed Easley on injured reserve. In 11 games of his rookie season, Easley finished with 9 tackles, 1 sack, 1 pass defended, and 1 interception. Without Easley, the Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX after they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks 28‚Äì24. After the departure of longtime starter Vince Wilfork, Easley began the 2015 season as one of the Patriots' starting defensive tackles. On December 15, 2015, the Patriots placed Easley on injured reserve once again, ending his season. He ended the season with 15 tackles and two sacks. In an unexpected move, the Patriots released Easley on April 13, 2016. =Los Angeles Rams= On May 17, 2016, Easley signed a one- year contract with the Los Angeles Rams after working out with the team. He played in all 16 games for the Rams in 2016, recording 35 tackles, 3.5 sacks, one pass deflected and two forced fumbles. On March 7, 2017, the Rams placed an original round (first-round) tender on Easley. On May 4, 2017, Easley signed his tender with the Rams. During training camp, Easley suffered a torn ACL, his fourth in his football career and second time in the NFL; he was then ruled out for the 2017 season. On March 19, 2018, Easley signed a one-year contract to remain with the Rams. On October 3, 2018, Easley was placed on injured reserve after undergoing another knee surgery. Without Easley, the Rams reached Super Bowl LIII where they lost 13-3 to Easley's former team New England Patriots. Personal life Easley's mother is of Haitian descent. Dominique has one older brother David Easley and one younger sister Destinee Easley who is a student at the New York Film Academy in Burbank, CA. Easley is a Muslim. He declared on his Twitter account that he converted to Islam on March 13, 2015.https://twitter.com/DominiqueEasley/status/576475323182678017 See also * List of Florida Gators in the NFL Draft * List of Los Angeles Rams players * List of New England Patriots players References External links *Los Angeles Rams bio *New England Patriots bio *Florida Gators bio Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Staten Island Category:Players of American football from New York (state) Category:American football defensive tackles Category:American sportspeople of Haitian descent Category:American Muslims Category:Florida Gators football players Category:New England Patriots players Category:Los Angeles Rams players Category:Under Armour All-American football players Category:Curtis High School alumni Category:Super Bowl champions ","title":"Dominique Easley"},{"id":"42272456","text":"The MBM scandal was an American political scandal of the 1970s which involved members of the Massachusetts Senate extorting money from McKee-Berger- Mansueto, Inc. (MBM), the consulting company supervising the construction of the University of Massachusetts Boston campus at Columbia Point. MBM contract On April 22, 1970, the Bureau of Building and Construction awarded the contract to supervise construction of the University of Massachusetts Boston's new campus at Columbia Point to MBM. Their fee was to be 1.53% of the approved budget for Phase I of the project, which was an estimated $2,295,000. The contract was approved by Commissioner of Administration and Finance Donald R. Dwight. =Criticism= On February 8, 1971, Wendell Woodman, a writer whose State House column appeared in many suburban newspapers, released the first in a five-part series of articles that attacked MBM's contract as a \\"sweetheart deal\\". According to Woodman, the Bureau of Building and Construction (BBC) \\"never negotiated the contract in any way, and that the McKee-Berger proposal was accepted intact by the Commonwealth before the state had seen it...The contract indicates there was collusion between the BBC and McKee-Berger, and possibly conspiracy\\". On February 11, Senator Joseph DiCarlo and Representatives Ralph Sirianni and William F. Hogan filed an order for the creation of a joint committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding the awarding of the contract to MBM. Extortion On February 18, MBM President Gerald McKee and the firm's attorney, Endicott Peabody, met with DiCarlo. According to McKee and Peabody, DiCarlo told them he was going to use the investigation to embarrass Dwight (who by then had been elected Lieutenant Governor), whom he viewed as a potential opponent in a future gubernatorial election, and would not consider the case on its merits. Anthony Mansueto, one of the company's senior vice presidents, then sought the help of Senator James A. Kelly, Jr. On March 17 the two met in Palm Beach, Florida. According to Mansueto, Kelly told him that he had talked with DiCarlo and \\"For $100,000, MBM's problems could be solved\\". The company did not pay the money and chose to let the matter pass. On March 29, 1971, a joint legislative committee was formed. DiCarlo was named the Senate Chairman and Sirianni was named the House Chairman. Senators DiCarlo, George V. Kenneally, Jr., and Robert Cawley and Representatives Sirianni, Paul Menton, J. Laurence Golden, J. Hilary Rockett, and James F. Hart were named to the committee. The committee held four hearings between May 5, 1971, and July 29, 1971. After the final hearing, McKee was afraid that his company would lose its contract. William Harding, MBM's head of sales, then talked to his friend, Senator Ronald MacKenzie, about the probable results of the investigation. According to Harding, MacKenzie told him that a favorable committee report would cost between $30,000 and $40,000. McKee and Mansueto concluded that the only way for MBM to keep their contract would be to pay the money. Harding made the first payment on October 11. Because the company was having cash flow problems, the payment was only $5,000. After the payment was made, MacKenzie gave Harding a draft copy of the committee's report, which he gave to McKee. McKee found the report to be ambiguous and dictated a memo about the good work MBM had done on the project, which Harding delivered to MacKenzie for inclusion in the final report. The next month, the committee issued its report, half of which was McKee's memo. A second $5,000 payment was made by Harding on November 20. McKee made a $10,000 payment on January 20, 1972. Harding made the fourth payment ($10,000) on February 18 and Jack Thomas, head of MBM's Boston office, made the final payment (also $10,000) on May 12. All of the payments were made to MacKenzie, several of which were made at a bar near MBM's Boston office. On July 6, DiCarlo and MacKenzie visited McKee in his New York City office. According to McKee, DiCarlo chastised him, saying that \\"They shouldn't have to chase MBM like creditors\\" and that the delayed payments had caused him \\"difficulty and embarrassment because he had to share them with others\\". Investigation, indictment, and trial In the spring of 1975, Federal investigators were looking into corruption in Pennsylvania. While under interrogation by a Federal prosecutor during a grand jury, an MBM official was asked if he knew of any similar corruption in any other state. He replied that he was aware of corruption in Massachusetts. The testimony was then forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Boston field office. Special Agent in Charge James O. Newpher assigned Agent Robert Sheenhan to the case, who investigated it in conjunction with U.S. Attorney James N. Gabriel. On August 13, 1976, a grand jury indicted DiCarlo and MacKenzie on charges of extortion, conspiracy, and other related offenses. Kelly was named as an unindicted co- conspirator, however the judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to link Kelly to the conspiracy and ordered that all references to him be removed from the indictment (Kelly's name was replaced with \\"John Doe\\" in the indictment). DiCarlo and Mackenzie were charged with violating the Hobbs Act, which forbids extortion by public officials, and the Travel Act, which forbids crossing state lines for the purpose of extortion. On August 20, DiCarlo and Mackenzie pleaded not guilty and were released on $1,000 bail. The trial began on January 24, 1977, in United States District Court in Boston. Walter Jay Skinner was the presiding judge. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Lee was the prosecuting attorney. Walter J. Hurley and Robert V. Mulkern were the defense lawyers. After a twenty-three-day trial, DiCarlo and MacKenzie were found guilty on all eight counts of corruption. They were sentenced to one year in prison and fined $5,000. Senate Ethics Committee investigation On February 28, DiCarlo and MacKenzie resigned their leadership positions (DiCarlo was Majority Leader and MacKenzie was Assistant Minority Whip). However, they refused to resign from the Senate. As a result of the scandal, the Senate created a standing committee on ethics. The committee consisted of three Democrats and two Republicans appointed by Senate President Kevin B. Harrington in consultation with Minority Leader John F. Parker. Senators Chester G. Atkins, John Olver, Robert E. McCarthy, William L. Saltonstall, and John Aylmer were the committee's first members and Watergate prosecutor James Vorenberg served as its first legal counsel. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was tasked with investigating the conduct of DiCarlo and MacKenzie. On March 31, MacKenzie resigned from the Senate. The following day the committee recommended that DiCarlo be expelled from the Senate. On April 4 the Senate voted 28 to 8 to expel DiCarlo. It was the first time in the Senate's 196-year history that a member had been expelled. Ward Commission In 1978, Representatives Philip W. Johnston and Andrew Card filed legislation to create the Special Commission Concerning State and County Buildings. The committee was granted the power to issue subpoenas and offer immunity in exchange for testimony. Governor Michael Dukakis chose Amherst College President John William Ward to chair the committee. The commission spent two and a half years investigating the awarding of architectural and construction contracts in Massachusetts over the previous two decades. It issued its final report on December 31, 1980. It found that Governors Endicott Peabody, John A. Volpe, and Francis W. Sargent routinely awarded state design contracts in exchange for political contributions. According to the report, $7.73 billion of the $17.1 billion spent on public construction jobs had been spent on projects with severe defects. Among the defects were leaking roofs and defective walls at Cape Cod Community College, the inability of the Salem State College library to support the weight of the books it was built to hold, the inability to see the stage from a third of the seats in the Boston State College auditorium, faulty heating and ventilation system at UMASS Boston, bricks falling from the facade of the UMASS Boston library, and a malfunctioning locking system at the Worcester County Jail. The report also found that $48.7 million had been spent on projects that were designed, but never built. Aftermath Due to the open-ended nature of the contract, MBM received $6 million for the UMASS project. After his expulsion, DiCarlo announced that he would run in the special election to regain his seat. He lost the Democratic primary to Frank J. Mastrocola, Jr., a 24-year-old one- term Alderman from Everett who ran on the slogan \\"If DiCarlo Wins, Massachusetts Loses\\". Before going to prison, DiCarlo named a number of other politicians who received money from MBM, including Harrington, Kelly, Speaker David M. Bartley, and Boston Mayor Kevin White. All denied accepting money, but Harrington's political career was effectively over due to the scandal. In December 1977 he admitted to cashing a $2,000 check from MBM. After this disclosure he abandoned plans to challenge Governor Michael Dukakis' renomination in 1978. On July 31, 1978, he resigned as Senate President. William Bulger, who succeeded DiCarlo as Majority Leader following his resignation succeeded Harrington as president. Bulger went on to become the Senate's longest tenured President. DiCarlo served ten months at the Federal Correctional Institution in Allenwood. After his release from prison, DiCarlo was unable to find employment for six months, but eventually accepted a job with a Revere construction company. He started out hauling wheelbarrows of cement, but was later moved to doing estimates. MacKenzie also served ten months in Allenwood. After his release in October 1978 he did paralegal work in the offices of attorney Richard M. Riley and State Senator Michael LoPresti Jr. On August 19, 1981, the Burlington Board of Selectmen voted 3 to 2 to make MacKenzie the town's veteran's agent. In December 1983 the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners ruled that MacKenzie, who graduated from Suffolk University Law School in 1976, was eligible to be lawyer in spite of his conviction. Kelly was later convicted of extorting $34,500 from a Worcester architectural firm. He was sentenced to two years in prison. After his release he spent many years living in Florida and later moved to Colorado, where he died on August 9, 2013.

In 1997, she got transferred to the Department of Zoology, Aligarh Muslim University first serving as a Reader and then a full Professor. Research She has been carrying out numerous studies on taxonomy, biodiversity, and biology of soil and aquatic nematodes resulting in discovery and description of several new species of Nematodes from India. Most recently her group discovered an intermediate species between two different genera of Nematodes. (referring in turn to Tahseen, Ahlawat, Asif, Mustaqim, 2016) In view of the scarcity of reports on these groups from India, she undertook the challenging task of exploring Indian habitats and made critical observations on the structure and morphology of free-living nematodes using LM and SEM. She has described and revised a good number of nematode taxa and has addressed the taxonomic identification from different perspectives so as to adopt a holistic approach combining morphological, developmental and ecological characteristics for better scientific value instead of the lopsided shallow morphological study. Her lucid and critical analyses of species supplemented with Scanning Electron Microscopic details were commended by peers and her wide taxonomic skills have been accredited internationally as she remains so far the only Asian to receive ONTA Special Award for sustained excellence in Nematology. She has also conducted pioneering studies in India on nematode development while her ecological findings led to the understanding of shifts in subterranean food web.

Blurb of the book: It is a fact that Keoladeo National Park (KNP) has been the focus of many earlier studies and faunal surveys but the nematode faunal diversity has been the aspect virtually neglected in all such work. The second author thus conceived this problem and submitted a proposal to Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF), New Delhi. The present work has seen the light of the day due to the curious efforts of the second author who volunteered the pioneering study on the nematodes of the KNP. This book brings about a detailed account of the nematodes and their ecological relevance in the wetland‚Äôs subterranean food web. Thus the degree of disturbance or the enrichment and the maturity status of the environment have been evaluated using these cost‚Äêeffective biological models. Rehmat Jehan and Qudsia Tahseen (2018) Diversity of Order Rhabditida in an Indian State Blurb of the book: Diversity is a broad term that refers to morphological variations as well as ecological versatility in the environment. With the technological advancement, the environmental conditions (soil, air and water) are deteriorating day by day due to accumulation of contaminants and pollutants. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the role and response of microorganisms in the soil food web to such changing conditions. Nematodes are such unique organisms that are found in nearly all environments and exhibit many feeding guilds. Their presence in soil pores is an advantageous feature that enables them to detect even minor changes in the concentration of soil chemicals. The present work has been done to study morphological, developmental and ecological diversity in nematodes of Order Rhabditida in an Indian State. The composition of nematode communities in three different habitats in the districts of Western Uttar Pradesh has been studies as indicator of soil health. Since Rhabditida is a diverse group with few species highly tolerant to the disturbances whereas others specifically susceptible, such type of comprehensive study gives a holistic measure of biotic and functional status of soil.

Outside of her work at the nursery, Lundeen traveled to other cities to teach the principles of nursing care for premature infants. With Hess, she also co-authored an early textbook on premature baby care. Biography =Early life= Lundeen was born in Rockford, Illinois on February 15, 1900. She graduated from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. She then completed nursing school at Lutheran Hospital in Moline, Illinois, and she worked at the hospital after graduation. Early in her career, Lundeen read a paper at the annual meeting of the Illinois State Association of Graduate Nurses in which she suggested that private duty nurses were too educated to accept cases involving incurable patients; the paper was subsequently published in the American Journal of Nursing. =Career= Hess had established the first American premature nursery at the Sarah Morris Children's Hospital within Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital in 1922. In 1924, he hired Lundeen to head the nursery. Hess and Lundeen focused on three goals in the care of preterm infants: maintaining body temperature, avoiding infection and providing nutrition. The pair advocated for breast milk as the optimal nutrition source for the preterm baby. In their attempts to prevent infection, staff in premature nurseries of the time wore gowns, masks and caps, and they even excluded parents from visitation. Feedings were given by eyedropper. By 1940, Lundeen had overseen the nursing care of more than 4,000 infants. As premature nurseries began to appear in other cities, she traveled extensively to teach other nurses about the care of preterm babies. Historians credit Lundeen with shaping the role of nurses in neonatal care. According to American Nursing: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 3, \\"because premature infants required such constant and labor-intensive care, neonatal nursing, as devised by Lundeen, became one of the rare places in a hospital where all medical personnel deemed nurses at least as important as doctors, if not more so.\\" Author Jeffrey P. Baker wrote that Lundeen was \\"a tireless worker who oversaw every aspect of the nursery, developing standards of care and detailed protocols addressing virtually any situation that might arise. Under her direction, nurses assumed practical control of the nursery, often provoking resentment from younger physicians who sought to work with Hess.\\" =Later life= Lundeen worked at Michael Reese for 38 years, retiring in 1962. She died on June 29, 1963. Lundeen had suffered from a chronic heart-related illness.

The film stars Daniel de Oliveira, Richard Sammel, Sergio Rubini and Julio Andrade. The film follows the trajectory of some men from the landmine clearance unit of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force who after a panic attack are trying to get tempers and defuse the mined road that separates them from a village monitored by enemy forces.  Plot  = Background = During World War II Brazil became an ally of Soviet Union, United States, UK and Free France, among other Allies. In the second half of 1944, it sent to the Italian Campaign, in several stages, a military contingent formed mainly by an infantry division to fight the forces of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Almost all these soldiers came from rural and poor backgrounds, and with no previous military experience, they had to learn in practice to fight for survival at the front.  Main Plot  After suffering a collective panic in a non specified point of Gothic Line, the soldiers Guimar√£es (Daniel de Oliveira), Piau√≠ (Gaspar Francisco), Laurindo (Thogum) and their Lieutenant (J√∫lio Andrade), try to retreat of the site, but end up missing their company. So, they had to decide to return to their unit under risk of facing court-martial for dereliction of duty, or return to the position of night before at risk of facing a surprise attack by numerous forces of enemy. That's when a war correspondent, Rui (Ivo Canelas), tells them about an active minefield and they think this is a chance to redeem the mistake they committed, but much is yet to happen and the war is far from over.

Turiya is identified with ‚Äúthat goal which all the Vedas declare‚Äù - ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•á ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç ‡§™‡§¶‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø (Katha Upanishad I.ii.15), and whose characteristics are not dissimilar to those of the non-dual Brahman (Mandukya Upanishad 7). Background Philosophy, according to Gaudapada and Adi Sankara, is an interpretation of the totality of human experience (bhoga) or of the whole of life from the standpoint of truth, and the object it seeks is the happiness (sukham) and welfare (hitam) of all beings (sarva sattva) in this world (ihaiva). Experience is participation in an event or connecting with a product of one‚Äôs own activities; an individual creates the world of his own experiences (dristisristivada). Rishi Kutsa Angirasa (Rig Veda I.102.2) draws attention to the fact that no happiness can be derived as relating to the material world of objects without knowing each of the constituents of creation endowed with name, form and colour that have made all objects of faith and devotion. Rishi Kakshivan (Rig Veda I.116.11) points out the subtlety involved in these matters consisting in the fact that the happiness experienced or to be experienced is in the mind and not in the object of faith or pleasure. Participation involves work (effort) and knowledge. Therefore, a Rishi of the Rig Veda prays:- : ‡§Ü ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∂‡§µ‡§É ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏ ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§£‡§É  : ‡§∂‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡§∏‡•á  (R.V. I.v.7) : \\"May the objects possessed of active qualities required for accomplishing various aims and gains or results prove beneficial to those learned ones who are the doers of praise-worthy deeds, who factually know the objects as to their qualities, means or utility, and their scope.\\" Here, the Rishi refers to the experiencing of things (active qualities) and inevitable consequences (beneficial results), and also to the mental modes (factually know) . In a mantra (Rig Veda I.164.32), : ‡§Ø ‡§à‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§® ‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶ ‡§Ø ‡§à‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂ ‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡•Å‡§ó‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•Å ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç  : ‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡•Ä‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡•ç‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ã‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§∂  Rishi Dirghatamas tells us that he who is engaged in works alone does not know his own form, but he who does and sees actions and knows his form, nature etc., is different who remaining different re-enters protectively in his mother‚Äôs womb returns to earth and re-engages again and again in auspicious works and actions. In this manner the Rishi speaks of two distinct experiences ‚Äì one which is yet to be experienced and the other which is already being experienced repeatedly; the experience which is yet to be experienced is what the Creator does, who creates for creation sake without being concerned about the results of his actions because His actions do not bind Him to anything, who continues to behave as though He is not aware of anything else. The ancient concept of ·πöta expresses the idea of a regulative principle in nature and human society; the cosmic energies (Devas), hostile forces (Asuras) and different spirits (Gandharvas and Apsaras), all are subject to Rta. All actions contribute to maintaining the cosmic order in balance through liturgy; the cosmic order is the manifestation of the Ultimate Reality (Brahman) which is Truth (Satya). The Rig Veda (X.85.1-2) celebrates the relationship between truth and cosmic law (·πöta). The Rig Veda (VII.56.12) also gives the equation of cosmic law (·πöta) and truth (Satya), it was by observing the cosmic law the rishis reached the truth. Satya signifies that which is eternal, the supreme, Existence in its own form Sat; rtam signifies that which is evident or perceptible, manifested out of the satya, what has come to be in accordance with satya or that which represents satya. The entire philosophy of the Upanishads, is based on the direct experience of the Vedic people; it is concerned with that knowledge which is common to all experience, everywhere, and not only to some specialized exclusive area of experience. Gaudapada, who rediscovered the Philosophy of Experience and wrote his Karika on the Mandukya Upanishad, too emphasises upon the impossibility of reaching the highest truth unless the totality of human experience or knowledge are taken into consideration and that the experiences in the waking state are required to be matched with the experiences in the other states of consciousness so that the individual inquiry is extended to the possible source of all consciousness. Gaudapada‚Äôs interpretation of Maya Ajativada, doctrine that there is no birth or production of substantial or fully real things anywhere or at any time, and therefore no real objective world outside consciousness, is central to Gaudapada who holds that all sensory and mental experience, except the experience of content-less consciousness, is illusion or Maya, which doctrine of Maya is in conformity with the Vedantic reaches and conclusions regarding the sole ever-existing eternal real entity (paramarthatah), Brahman, which has nothing different from it, and none whatever outside it (advaita), whose reality can be known ('experienced') through the cultivated meditative experience of non-dual consciousness. He maintains the doctrine that the universe was not created at all but takes some cognisance at least of the world as real, though it may be for the perfection of mystical endeavour or ethical conduct even though, philosophically, he may regard it as not having been created at all. Gaudapada‚Äôs concept of experience Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (II.iii.4-5) tells us that the essence of that which is gross, mortal, limited and defined is the eye, which means that the mental mode associated with comparison is connected with the eye which perceives things and qualities and gives rise to duality and multiplicity i.e. separateness; the eye is the Sun which is the defined but the defined is that which moves within the eye. Gaudapada explores the transcendences by the Self of the three states detailed by the Upanishads and speaks about Vaishvanara, the all-pervading and met with the eye, experiencing the external things; Taijasa which is inside the mind, as experiencing the inner things and Prajna is the mass of consciousness in the space within the heart, all three interlinked by memory as \\"I\\". In this context, Sankara explains that on cessation of the activity called memory Prajna becomes free from diversity and there is no functioning of the mind; perception and recollection are merely vibrations of the mind; in the absence of these there is merely existence of an un-manifested state in the heart. Therefore, the indescribable state of Turiya, is neither a void nor an unreal illusion without a substratum, and is held to be the all-pervasive source of all entities. Vaishvanara and Taijasa are held to be conditioned by cause and effect; Prajna is conditioned by cause, but cause and effect do not exist in Turiya. Cause and effect spring into being so long as there is mental preoccupation with cause and effect; there is no origination of cause and effect when engrossment with cause and effect becomes attenuated. As long as there is mental preoccupation with causality so long does the worldly state continue; when engrossment with causality is exhausted, one does not attain the worldly state. Everything seems to be born because of the empirical outlook; therefore there is nothing eternal; from the standpoint of Reality, everything is the birthless Self; therefore there is no such thing as annihilation (Karika VI.55-57). Apparent manifestations of the self Gaudapada begins with the three apparent manifestations of the self ‚Äì 1) as the 'experiencer' of the external world in the Waking state (visva or Vaishvanara atman), 2) as the 'experiencer' in the Dream state (Taijasa atman) and as the 'experiencer' in Deep sleep state or susupti (Prajna) when there is no determinate knowledge, but pure consciousness and pure bliss or ananda; the person who knows these three as one is never attached to these experiences. He also describes the Fourth state of the self (Turiya) which is advaita ('non- dual') and the All. In the Waking state things are imagined as if existing outside, and in the Dream state, things are imagined internally, both of them are illusory creations of the self; truth is that reality which is perceived as the imagination-less cessation of all appearances (nirvikalpah prapancopasamah). The thing that has beginning and an end is false; the existing of things is illusory; things exist only as far as they merely appear or are related to experience and as merely thoughts with which fools are deluded. Gaudapada‚Äôs examination of the experience of the experiencing self Gaudapada points out that the unchangeable reality is the witness behind the three states of consciousness, waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep, in all these states the Self is ever-present, and though remaining unknown is the unaffected 'experiencer' of all actions and thoughts in these three states. In deep sleep the mind is withdrawn and does not know anything, but it is disciplined and not withdrawn in turiya, existent and all-seeing. When the individual self, sleeping under the influence of maya ('ignorance'), is awakened, it then realizes non-duality which is beginning-less and endless; this is the way to illumination within one‚Äôs own soul to realize supreme bliss. Gaudapada insists that the mind should not be allowed to enjoy the bliss that arises out of the condition of absorption. It should be freed from attachment to such happiness through the exercise of discrimination. When the mind does not lose itself in inactivity and oblivion, or is not distracted by desires, when the mind achieves quietness and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes Brahman. The waking and the dreaming states are equally real and equally unreal, real only in relative sense and unreal as compared with the transcendental in which there is identification with Reality, the unchangeable Self. There is no absolute reality of creation, the one infinite Existence appears to be the manifold universe which universe is not a reality but something superimposed upon the Atman. Bondage and liberation, the individual soul and the world, are all unreal. The supreme bliss is the very nature of the Atman, an absolute reality which persists. Patanjali‚Äôs concept of experience Patanjali tells us that experiences of pleasure and pain are the fruits of merit and demerit, respectively; pain is caused by false identification of the experiencer with the object of experience, and the pain which is yet to come may be avoided. The \\"experiencer\\" is the Atman, the real human nature, and the \\"object of experience\\" is the totality of the apparent world, including the mind and the senses; so long as the experiencer is falsely identified with the object of experience the Atman cannot be known. Patanjali states ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ ‚Äì ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§≤‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡§®‡§æ ‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ (Yoga Sutra I.10) that \\"sleep is a wave of thought about nothingness\\", which means sleep is a positive experience of nothingness, when the already perceived objects are not forgotten but as experiences unite themselves to the system which existed at the time of going to sleep, in that state there is continuity of experience and the function of remembering is not reduced to utter confusion. He explains that the mind having innumerable impressions and desires acts only to serve the Atman and is able to perceive because it reflects both the Atman and the objects of perception, it cannot act independently for its own sake. The man of discrimination ceases to regard the mind as the Atman, and moves towards liberation. Distractions due to past impressions may arise if the mind relaxes its discrimination, even a little but can be overcome in the same manner as obstacles to enlightenment, that is, by resolving the mind back into its primal cause through meditation. Patanjali tells us ‚Äì ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§ß‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ (Yoga Sutras II.27) that the experiencer gains the knowledge of the Atman in seven stages, advancing towards the highest beginning with - a) the realization that the source of all spiritual wisdom is inside us, and proceeding to b) when attachments and aversions lose their power, to c) complete realization of, and union with the Atman when the objective universe disappears, to d) when the man of illumination no longer identifies the external world with the Atman, to e) when the mind and the objective world ends their services to the experiencer, to f) when the stored-up impressions within the mind and the gunas fall away forever, and finally to g) when the state of eternal existence in union with the Atman is reached. Swami Prabhavananda in connection with Yoga Sutra II.50 tells us that Prana is the vital energy by which we live and all the powers of the body and all the functions of the senses and the mind are expressions of the force of Prana; when the Kundalini is aroused it produces various degrees of enlightenment experienced by the experiencer at seven centers ‚Äì according to Raja yoga when the mind is attached to worldliness, when it dwells in three lower centers, it has no higher spiritual ambitions or visions and stays immersed in the cravings of lust and greed; the fourth center is the heart dwelling wherein the mind makes one experience the first spiritual awakening and is filled with wonder and awe; the mind reaching the fifth center, the throat, makes one freed from ignorance and delusion; with the mind reaching the sixth center, the forehead, there is the direct vision of the Lord; and when the mind reaches the seventh center at the top of the head, Samadhi is attained. These are the seven gradual yogic experiences. Implication In response to his query ‚Äì \\"Which is the deity who experiences dream?\\" ‚Äì Surya was told - ‡§Ö‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•à‡§∑ ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‚Äì \\"In the dream state the deity, the mind, experiences greatness (consisting in assuming diverse forms of subject and object)\\" (Prasna Upanishad IV.5); the mind is the instrument of the perceiver in the matter of experiencing greatness, and Sankara explains that the individual soul conditioned by the mind only appears to experience things in its wakefulness and in the dream-state. The body and senses depend on ignorance, desire, and the result of past actions, when these become quiet the nature of the Self becomes non-dual, auspicious and calm. The common experience of Duality, which contains truth and untruth, is produced by the power of illusion (Maya), it is only through religious activities that are features of duality ‚Äì based experiences that the understanding and attainment of the supreme non-dual becomes possible. Gaudapada and Sankara relate mƒÅyƒÅ to the Vedic metaphor of hidden (g≈´dha) Brahman (Katha Upanishad (I.iii.12)). Gaudapada shows that it is only the existent that can appear, the non-existent cannot appear. Sankara tells us that the common experience depends on adhyasa (cognition of 'that' in 'not-that'), on something superimposed, and which is a transcendental error or avidya. Dvaita in whatever form is perceived by the mind, duality ceases when the mind ceases to exist and function as the mind. And, Sankara concedes that the Samadhi experience ('Transcendental Consciousness'), which describes the state devoid of cognitive functioning, will not be established, if the phenomenal self is not considered distinct from the cognitive faculty which faculty cannot be an agent. Sankara insists: :‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ò‡§æ‡§§‡•ã‡§Ω‡§™‡§ø ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§®‡§æ‡§π‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§¶‡•É‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§¶‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§∞‡§Æ‡§®‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á‡§® ‡§®‡§ø‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ø  :\\"Similarly be sure that you are not the complex of the gross and the subtle- bodies, and intelligently determine, by inference, that you, the ‚Äòseer‚Äô, are entirely distinct from the seen\\" (Vakya Vritti.Sl. 17) which means that a person should firmly ascertain that in himself he is something other than the gross and the subtle bodies. In his commentary on this statement, Swami Chinmayananda tells us that the misapprehension that the products of matter, such as body, mind and intellect, are the Self, is an experience caused by the non-apprehension of the Spiritual Essence; the non-apprehension of the Supreme Self in all its supreme transcendental resplendency, generates endless misapprehensions which are to be removed by invoking knowledge, the direct apprehension of the Self. Unlike Sankara, Ramanuja does not admit a distinction between illusory perception and true perception, for he declares that even in illusory perception, so-called, there is some perception of reality. Thus all experience has its validity. The immediate intuition of God is not the highest transcendental consciousness (Turiya) but rather it is the transcendental experience of God in which there remains the ego as distinct from him. R.D.Ranade states that the Upanishadic seers throw hints and suggest the way for realizing the Self, only too cognizant of the fact that any description of the great mystic experience by word of mouth would fall short of reality, as much as any mediate, intellectual, or expressible knowledge would fall short of immediate, intuitive, first-hand experience. There is the same gulf between the expression of an experience and the enjoyment of it, as there is between knowledge and being.

It has an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 8.50, having varied between magnitudes 7.35 and 8.58. Feinstein and colleagues reported in 1976 that it had decreased by 0.9 magnitude between 1969 and 1976, whereas it had only varied by 0.3 magnitude in the 70 years beforehand. Sometimes it could vary by up to 0.5 magnitude in a year or 0.1 magnitude in a night, and there did not appear to be any regular period to its variability. Astronomer Anatoly Miroshnichenko has made it the prototype of a new type of variable star, the FS Canis Majoris variables. These are hot blue- white stars that exhibit forbidden line emission and strong infra-red excess suggestive of very young (pre-main-sequence) stars yet they do not lie in star-forming regions. Nor did they appear to be stars that had evolved off the main sequence into giant or supergiant stars. It is now thought that they are main sequence stars that have absorbed or are absorbing matter, most likely from a companion star, and are surrounded by a compact dusty shell. These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust. Its spectral type has been previously classified as B2III to B2V and its bolometric magnitude as -4.89. However, investigation of its spectrum in 2006 showed that FS Canis Majoris is a binary system. The system is between 1250 and 8000 times as luminous as the Sun. One calculation has the masses of the primary and secondary at 9.3¬±0.5 and 4.8¬±0.9 solar masses and radii 6.6¬±0.5 and 2.9¬±0.6 times that of the Sun, and surface temperatures of 21,600¬±350 and 16,380¬±1670 K respectively.

The series was picked up by Crunchyroll for simulcast streaming with English subtitles. The anime has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks. Plot The story takes place in a world where two countries, Arandas and Ingelmia, have been warring against each other for a very long time. Tokimune Sumusu, a young man belonging to Independent Unit 8 of Arandas, saves a girl named Jamie when she is attacked by enemy forces. In order to survive, he pilots the new mech Argevollen and fights. The new mech Argevollen is defined by its U-Link system wherein the Argevollen molds to its pilot's mind and cannot be piloted by anyone else. This customization allows the pilot to use it by envisioning in his mind what he wants it to do, rather than physically moving and steering it.  Overview  A world in which aircraft cannot be used due to large-scale environmental and geological changes caused by the explosion of strategic weapons (SMMs) used in past wars.https://web.archive.org/web/20151128010514/http://www.argevollen.com/contents/world/index.html The war was still ongoing, centuries after the disaster, which occurred in A.O. (World Calendar) 2015. In addition to existing land weapons, the warring nations use humanoid mobile weapons called \\"Trail Kriegers\\". One of these, piloted by Tokimune Susumu, belongs to the independent eighth unit of the \\"Kingdom of Arandas alliance\\". Both Alandas and Ingelmia have long histories and corruption in their military. As the war between Arandas and the neighboring \\"Ingelmia Union\\" continues, the Great Wall, the fortress of Arandas that has long prevented the invasion of enemy nations, is finally on the verge of falling. In the midst of that, Independent Eighth Unit finds a civilian trailer chased by the Ingelmia army. Tokimune, angry at the unit's policy of abandoning it, jumps out alone and protects Jamie Hazaford, an engineer who was on the trailer. At Jamie's suggestion, Tokimune then enters the new trail krieger, \\"Argevollen\\", which was on the trailer. The Independent Eighth Unit, including Jamie and the prototype Argevollen, survived the retreat and returned safely. However, by default, Argevollen was only able to be activated by Jamie and piloted by Tokimune Jamie tries to leave the unit, but is forced to stay by her employer, the private company \\"Kibernes Manufacturing Company\\" which had developed Argevollen. Tokimune tries to find the truth of his dead sister. Jamie accompanies the unit while complaining about being in combat. Samonji Ukyo, the captain of the Independent Eighth Unit, discusses his thoughts on Argevollen. Ingelmia claims the royalty in Alandas is corrupt, as part of their propaganda. The Ingelmia army tries to obtain information from engaging with Argevollen. And an unknown company, Kibernes Manufacturing Company is selling weapons to both sides and using battles to collect data for making more powerful weapons. The battlefield where each thought intersects will enter a new phase. Characters =Kingdom of Arandas alliance= ; : :A young and reckless soldier who becomes the sole pilot of the new Trail Krieger prototype Argevollen.
