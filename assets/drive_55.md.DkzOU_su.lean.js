It began with 8 students in 1907, as an institution offering courses only up to the twelfth grade. Following a temporary closure in 1913 it resumed operations in 1919. In 1936 it was renamed West Indian Training College. As its offerings developed to include theology, teacher education, secretarial science, business, and natural sciences, it became a junior college. It achieved senior college status in the late 1950s when it began to offer the bachelor's degree in Theology and was renamed West Indies College in 1959. Since then, baccalaureate programmes in some twenty other disciplines have been added. In 1999 the college was granted university status by the Jamaican Government, and was renamed Northern Caribbean University. Currently the university offers graduate and post- graduate programs in the sciences, religion, business and education.

Special education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 322 pupils or 23.4% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Student Support Team/Evaluation Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may request a multidisciplinary evaluation in writing to the Special Education Department. In 2010, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Columbia Borough School District received a $1,176,993 supplement for special education services in 2010. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 28 or 2.04% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. The principal acts as the case manager for the referral process. A 60 calendar day time-line begins when the signed Permission to Evaluate form is received. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Through the strategic planning process, the Superintendent must ensure that Columbia Borough School District provides a continuum of program and service options to meet the needs of all mentally gifted students for enrichment, acceleration, or both. The district's program is based on student needs and provides differentiated curriculum using acceleration, enrichment and pull-out options. Bullying Policy The Columbia Borough School District Administration reported that there were no incidents of bullying occurring in the schools in 2009. The school board prohibits bullying by district students and employees. The Board directs that complaints of bullying and harassment shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007-2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 District administration are required to annually provide the following information with the district's Safe School Report: the board's bullying policy, a report of bullying incidents in the school district, and information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention or education programs. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2009, the district reported employing over 100 teachers with a starting salary of $36,892 for 180 days for pupil instruction. The average teacher salary was $53,924 while the maximum salary was $108,160. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. Additionally, Columbia Borough School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, reimbursement for professional development courses, 2 paid personal days, 10 sick days, 5 paid bereavement days and many other benefits.

In 2010, Conestoga Valley School District received an 18,51% increase, which was the highest increase in BEF among Lancaster County public school districts. Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010-11 school year. One hundred fifty school districts received the base 2% increase in 2010-11. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided Columbia Borough School District an 8.61% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $6,665,736. The state Basic Education funding to the district in 2008-09 was $6,137,298.55. The district also received supplemental funding for English language learners, Title 1 federal funding for low-income students, for district size, a poverty supplement from the commonwealth and more. Columbia Borough School District received the highest increase in Lancaster County for the 2009-10 school year at 8.61%. Among the 500 school districts in Pennsylvania, Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 746 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11 the Columbia Borough School District applied for and received $325,644 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the seventh year and for teacher training. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Columbia Borough School District received did not apply for funding in 2006-07 or in 2007-08. For the 2008‚Äì09, school year the district received $74,691. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards. Education Assistance grant The state's Education Assistance Program funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11 the Columbia Borough School District received $119,489.Pennsylvania Department of Education - Educational Assistance Program Funding 2010-2011 Fiscal Year School Improvement Grant In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal department of education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program.Pennsylvania Department of Education School Improvement information The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest-achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding.Pennsylvania School Improvement Grant Components_Stat_Requirements Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart - close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day.PA Department of Education School Improvement Federal Funds for School Reforms to Boost Student Achievement Awardees 2010 Two district schools qualified for this funding in 2010. Columbia Borough School District Administration did not apply for the grant.School Improvement grants 2010 =Federal Stimulus funding= The district received an extra $1,851,015 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was for the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-11 school years. Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district over one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Columbia Borough School Board chose to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement any of the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The Columbia Borough School Board set property tax rates in 2010-2011 at 25.3700 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Columbia Borough School District was $287 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,219 property owners applied for the tax relief. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Lancaster County, the highest property tax relief in 2009 was awarded to the approved property owners in School District of Lancaster at $446. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility to participate is set by school board policy By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

She was also a teacher, college administrator and a notable board member for the Arlington Public Schools, and the founder of WETA-TV, the first public television station in Washington, D.C. Early and family life Elizabeth Pfohl was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to a Moravian minister and a music teacher. She had a sister, Ruth, who survived her. Pfohl received her high school education at Salem Academy where she graduated in 1919. She then attended Salem College, a related institution, and received a bachelor's degree in education in 1923. She later received her master's degree in education from Columbia University. Pfohl married the trial lawyer Rev. Edmund D. Campbell Jr., a widower, in 1936, and moved with him to Arlington, Virginia, where she helped to raise his two children. The couple also had three children together. Campbell predeceased his long-lived mother, but the twins H. Donald Campbell and Rev. Benjamin P. Campbell and their sister Virginia Campbell Holt survived her, as did nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Educator and school board chair Pfohl returned to her high school to begin her education career, teaching girls at Salem Academy and, after two years, she began teaching college level courses. She then moved into education administration, as dean of Moravian College for Women in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for two years (although she was just 25 when appointed). Beginning in 1929, and during the Great Depression until 1936, Pfohl was dean at Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Virginia. In Arlington, as she raised her family, Campbell realized that Virginia's public schools had very real problems, in part due to underfunding, as well as policies of racial segregation which had been added to the state constitution early in the century. In 1947, Campbell was elected to the school board of Arlington County, Virginia, which was the first directly elected school board in Virginia. She was the first woman on a school board in the state of Virginia. While on the board (beginning in 1948, and including after her re-election in 1951), Campbell was instrumental in adding fine arts classes, as well as comparable facilities for African-American and white students. She also led efforts to secure higher teacher salaries and build new schools in the growing city. Campbell was the school board's chair from 1950 until 1956, when Arlington's elected school board was replaced by an appointed board during the state's Massive Resistance crisis. Beginning in 1954, Campbell helped pave the way to desegregate Arlington's public schools, despite opposition to the Supreme Court's decisions in Brown vs. Board of Education proclaimed by Virginia's U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr. and others. Her husband came to represent parents of students in Norfolk, Virginia who had been locked out of schools closed by the Byrd Organization rather than allow then to integrate pursuant to court orders. Both Campbells sought to work with parents across the state to resolve the crisis. On January 19, 1959, separate decisions of the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed racial segregation as unconstitutional, and parts of segregationists' workaround attempts as unconstitutional. Although the governor (and former attorney general) J. Lindsay Almond Jr. had initially supported Massive Resistance, he recognized judicial authority. Both Arlington's and Norfolk's schools peacefully desegregated in February 1959. Campbell was again elected to the school board later that year, and again was its chair from 1960 to 1962. WETA and Public Broadcasting Campbell had been intrigued by the power of television since the 1940s, believing that it could be used for educational purposes. In 1952, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorized Channel 26 to be designated for educational television and, in 1953, the Greater Washington Educational Television Association (GWETA) was created. Campbell joined the GWETA in 1956, initially as vice chairman, and became president a year later. While she was the GWETA president, Campbell worked hard to raise funds for a local educational TV station in Washington, DC. In 1961, an application was sent to the FCC to open WETA and, on October 2, the station went on the air. The station initially was on the air only during daytime hours on weekdays but, by 1966, it was on the air 86 hours a week, including weekends. WETA-TV today is on the air 24 hours a day and is the third largest public television station in the United States. In 1966, Campbell helped to expand WETA into the radio market, with a WETA radio station going on the air in 1970 at 90.9 FM, which plays mostly classical music and NPR news programming. Post-WETA work In 1971, Campbell retired from the GWETA and WETA-TV as its president, but held the position of vice president of community affairs, which she held until she died. During this time, she helped to launch the Children's Art Festival of the Washington, ,area and the Elizabeth P. Campbell Lecture Series, which presented broadcasting notables. Because of her groundwork for WETA as well as public broadcasting in general, Campbell was given high honors, including an Emmy Award in 1987, honorary doctorates from Washington and Lee University and Salem College. Campbell also won many awards in the Public Broadcasting community for her service, from PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Campbell continued to serve on other community boards, including the Northern Virginia Fine Arts Association, the YWCA, and as a board of trustees member for Salem Academy, where she organized a partnership between the school and WETA-TV which included internships for Salem students during their January term. Death and legacy On January 9, 2004, Campbell died in Arlington after a brief illness at the age of 101. The Virginia State Senate passed Joint Resolution No. 174 noting \\"with great sadness the loss of a unique and irreplaceable citizen\\". The Arlington Public Schools in 2017 named a new elementary school to honor her and her late husband,https://wamu.org/story/17/08/18/time-talk-names-schools-says- arlington-county-school-board/ and Arlington County had previously erected a historical marker and named \\"Campbell Lane\\" near WETA headquarters after the couple.

He is best known for his long association with Universal Studios, where his credits included Harvey, The Glenn Miller Story (1954), several Francis movies and the Tammy series. Biography He was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of an immigrant fisherman. One of seven children, a younger brother was the painter Edward Brodney and his older brother Max a doctor. Brodney attended both Boston University and Harvard College. He earned a law degree from the latter and became a lawyer. He began writing night club and vaudeville routines as a hobby and became a radio writer. =Early film career= Brodney was working as a \\"radio idea man\\" in 1941. He and writing partner Jack Rubin had submitted a number of stories to Hollywood studios and only got polite rejections. They pitched a vehicle for Charles Boyer called Appointment for Love to Universal producer Bruce Manning, who bought the story. He and Rubin became writers on Baby Face Morgan (1942) for the Producers Releasing Corporation, Brodney's first credit. He was then assigned to the musical When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1942) at Universal. Universal is where Brodney would work for most of his career. When Johnny Comes Marching Home starred Allan Jones who was in Brodney's next films, Moonlight in Havana (1942) and You're a Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith (1943) (he only provided the story of the latter). He did Always a Bridesmaid (1943) with the Andrews Sisters, an original of his; Rhythm of the Islands (1943) with Jane Frazee; and On Stage Everybody(1945). In 1945 he was reportedly working on a biopic of dance teacher Arthur Murray and Love Takes a Holiday for Joan Davis but neither were made. Brodney went over to RKO for What a Blonde (1945). Back at Universal he wrote She Wrote the Book (1946); Mexican Hayride (1948) with Abbott and Costello; For the Love of Mary (1948) with Deanna Durbin; and Are You with It? (1948) with Donald O'Connor. He sold a story to Linda Darnell called Flamenco and Three Cornered Honeymoon for Jack Oakie but these were not made. RKO used him again for If You Knew Susie (1948) the last movie of Eddie Cantor. At Universal he worked on Yes Sir, That's My Baby (1949) with O'Connor; Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff (1949), doing some uncredited work; The Gal Who Took the West (1949), based on a story he devised with William Bowers; Arctic Manhunt (1949); and Frenchie (1950) with Joel McCrea and Shelley Winters, based on his story. Brodney was one of several writers on the hugely popular Harvey (1950). He also wrote South Sea Sinner (1950) with Winters; Curtain Call at Cactus Creek (1950) with O'Connor; Comanche Territory (1950) with Maureen O'Hara; and Little Egypt (1951) with Rhonda Fleming. Universal put him on a Francis sequel, Francis Goes to the Races (1951) with O'Connor. He wroteKatie Did It (1951) with Ann Blyth; Double Crossbones (1951) a pirate comedy with O'Connor; Back at the Front (1952) with Tom Ewell; and Francis Goes to West Point (1952) with O'Connor. A proposed musical starring O'Connor, Son of Robin Hood, was not made. =Historical films= Brodney began working on more historical material with Scarlet Angel (1952) with Yvonne De Carlo and Rock Hudson. He was nominated for an Oscar for The Glenn Miller Story screenplay which he wrote with Valentine Davies in 1954. That year he signed a two-year contract with the studio, where he had been based since 1942, except for two years during the war. He wrote Walking My Baby Back Home (1953) and Francis Covers the Big Town (1953) with O'Connor, then returned to history with Sign of the Pagan (1954) with Jeff Chandler; The Black Shield of Falworth (1954) with Tony Curtis; The Spoilers (1955) with Chandler; Lady Godiva of Coventry (1955) with O'Hara; The Purple Mask (1955) with Curtis; and Captain Lightfoot (1955) with Hudson. He wrote a film No, No Nora which appears to have not been made. In March 1956 Brodney left Universal. He went to work at RKO on The Great Maestro a biopic of Ben Bernie that was never made. Brodney began working in TV on shows such as Lux Video Theatre, Casey Jones, General Electric Theater, Schlitz Playhouse of Stars and Studio 57. He continued doing features like A Day of Fury (1956) and Star in the Dust (1956), and had a huge hit with Tammy and the Bachelor (1957) at Universal for producer Ross Hunter. =Producer= In the late 1950s he began to produce movies, his first one being When Hell Broke Loose at Paramount in 1958, where he was co-producer. The movie starred Charles Bronson. He went to England where he produced and co wrote Bobbikins (1959), a vehicle for Max Bygraves at 20th Century Fox. Brodney continued to write for TV on such shows as Death Valley Days, The Alaskans, and Danger Man. Back in Hollywood he produced a vehicle for Pat Boone, All Hands on Deck (1961), and one for Frankie Vaughan, The Right Approach (1961), both made at Fox. He returned to Universal as a writer for Tammy Tell Me True (1961) and Tammy and the Doctor (1963). He also wrote The Brass Bottle (1964), I'd Rather Be Rich (1964) with Sandra Dee; and The Sword of Ali Baba (1965). A profile on I'd Rather Be Rich called Brodney \\"comparatively unsung\\" in Hollywood. He wrote a film It Comes Up Love that was meant to be filmed in Britain in 1967 but appears to have never been made. =Later career= Brodney's final credits include episodes of the TV series It Takes a Thief and the British film 1000 Convicts and a Woman (1971) aka Fun and Games. In 1971, he was working on a biopic of Babe Didrikson Zaharias. That year, he signed a two- picture deal with Robert Stone to write scripts, including one called Intrigue. Neither of these appear to have been made. His final credit was Ghost Fever (1987). Brodney died in 2008, six days before his 101st birthday. Some members of Brodney's family learned of his death through an update to this page, a story which is told in this blog post .

Earlier commentators have attributed this failure to such matters as weak slogans. Nunberg argues that the problem runs much deeper, in that the entire political discourse in the United States today has been shaped heavily by conservatives. According to Nunberg, ordinary words like values, freedom, patriotism, and indeed liberal itself have acquired connotations that conservatives favor and that even allegedly liberal newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post take for granted. Nunberg contends that conservatives have used these terms to paint a picture of elite liberals out of touch with the values of mainstream, middle-class Americans. This stereotype, which Nunberg considers inaccurate, is nonetheless so firmly entrenched in popular consciousness that Republicans need only mention a word like elite to conjure up the image of a stuffy, out- of-touch liberal. Democratic politicians have tried to reclaim some of these terms, such as when presidential candidate John Kerry styled his 2004 campaign \\"a celebration of American values.\\" But such efforts are ineffective, Nunberg argues, because they do little to unhinge the powerful quasi-populist narrative that conservatives have developed over several decades. Nunberg calls on Democrats to create an equally powerful (but, in their view, more truthful) narrative of their own through which they can weave together the many issues of advantage to them.

Tsankawi is a detached portion of Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, near White Rock. It is accessible from a roadside parking area just north of the intersection of East Jemez Road and State Road 4. A self-guided 1.5-mile loop trail provides access to numerous unexcavated ruins, caves carved into soft tuff, and petroglyphs.  Origin of the name  The name Tsankawi [s…ô≈ãÀ°k…ëwi] (Sa'ekewikwaje Owingeh) may mean \\"village between two canyons at the clump of sharp round cacti\\" or more simply, (san-ke-wii) \\"Opuntia sharp gap\\" in the Tewa language of the nearby San Idelfonso puebloans.  History  Cavate cliff dwellings (one walled up) with steps worn into the soft tuff. Tsankawi (san-KAH-wee) was built by ancient Pueblo Indians sometimes known as the Ancestral Pueblo People. Archeological evidence indicates that Tsankawi may have been constructed in the 15th century and occupied until the late 16th century‚Äîtoward the end of the Rio Grande Classic Period. It was occupied by Ancestral Pueblo people. Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) indicates that a severe drought occurred in the late 16th century. Traditions at a number of nearby Tewa Pueblos, including San Ildefonso Pueblo, Santa Clara Pueblo, Pojoaque Pueblo, and Tesuque Pueblo claim ancestral ties to Tsankawi and other nearby pueblo sites. Archeological evidence indicates that the Indians first settled the surrounding area in small communities during the late 12th century. Over time fewer, but larger communities were built. Tsankawi was one of these larger communities. The trail follows centuries-old paths through the area where the ancestral Pueblo people lived. According to Pueblo tradition, the people of Tsankawi spoke Tewa, while those in Frijoles Canyon, the main section of Bandelier, spoke Keres. While their languages were different, their religious beliefs, lifestyles, and worldviews were similar. Even today, active pueblos San Ildefonso, Cochiti, and others retain strong social and traditional ties with these two cultural sites. The 1.5-mile trail through Tsankawi takes you along centuries-old paths of the ancestral Pueblo people. In many areas, the trails have been worn into the rock 8 to 24 inches or more as the people traveled from the mesa tops to their farms in the canyons below. The trails also connected to other villages in the surrounding area. The natives either wore sandals or walked barefoot Much of the site has never been excavated, however Edgar Hewett did excavate at least 2 burial mounds near the main pueblo room blocks during his studies of the area in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Tsankawi village Pottery Shards Near Tsankawi The village was built out of tuff stone plastered inside and out with mud. It was roughly rectangular in shape with about 350 rooms and an enclosed central courtyard or plaza. Not only were the rooms used for cooking and sleeping, but for storage of food for the winter months or when crops failed. The architectural design with rooms surrounding a central plaza is still used by present-day Indians. The buildings were two or perhaps three stories high with roofs made out of wood and mud. But why have a village on the top of a mesa where, with the exception of rain collected into a small reservoir, water had to be hauled from the springs or rivers below. There has not been any archeological evidence of warfare, but further research is needed. The Tsankawi inhabitants were totally dependent upon the environment for survival. The climate was dry averaging 15 inches of rainfall a year, yet the inhabitants were able to develop an agricultural way of life. They made use of native plants such as the pinion pine, juniper, rabbit brush, saltbush, mountain mahogany, and yucca for food, dyes, medicine, and tools. They also cultivated corn, beans and squash. Yet in this sparse environment, natural resources were scarce, and over time the Puebloans depleted their resources. Firewood became hard to find and the soil became exhausted due to centuries of farming. During the 16th century an extended drought, indicated by tree ring dating, forced the inhabitants to move on. The pueblo at San Ildefonso, 8 miles away, have the tradition that their ancestors lived at Tsankawi and the surrounding area. The people of Tsankawi were not isolated. There were many villages on nearby mesas or in the canyons. The people traded tools, blankets, pottery, feathers, turquoise, seashells, and agricultural products. They joined together for religious activities. The village plaza may have been a gathering place for dancing and ceremonies. Since there was no metal, tools were made from local materials. Obsidian formed by the Jemez volcanoes was used to make arrow points, knives, and scrapers. Volcanic basalt was used as manos and metates to grind seeds and corn. It was also used to enlarge the soft tuff caves and to shape blocks used in building. After the inhabitants left in the late 16th century, the buildings fell into ruin. The roofs collapsed and the walls crumbled. Wind blown materials filled the cracks and crevices so that only mounds of rubble can be seen with pieces of pottery lying on the ground. Tsankawi cave dwellings Cavate Entrances, Tsankawi The ancient pueblo inhabitants of Tsankawi not only had a settlement on top of the mesa, but built their homes along the base of the cliffs. They dug caves into the soft tuff stone and extended the dwelling with walls made of talus rock mortared with mud. (Talus are the loose stones found at the base of a cliff.) The roofs were made with timber and mud. These dwellings are called talus pueblos. 354 talus pueblos have been documented on Tsankawi Mesa with most being located at the weak boundary between the Tshirege and Otowi members of the Bandelier Tuff that forms the bedrock of the mesa.Bloom, Ryan Alexander. The Forgotten Side of Bandelier - Archeology of the Tsankawi Ruins at Bandelier National Monument. 2019. Since the time that the talus pueblos were inhabited, the masonry walls have collapsed. The only thing that remains are caves, or cavates, carved into the cliffs and socket holes which were used to support timbers for the roof. Where not exposed to the elements, the caves are blackened from fires used for cooking and for heat during the winter months. The talus pueblos were built on the south facing side of the mesas. During winter months the afternoon sun would warm the southern cliffs melting the snow, but the northern facing cliffs frequently had snow all winter long. The walls were frequently plastered with clay perhaps for aesthetic reasons or to help prevent the walls from crumbling. Artwork along the walls can be seen in a number of the caves in the form of pictographs carved into the rock and painting remnants where clay still sticks to the walls. Tsankawi petroglyphs Tsankawi petroglyphs Numerous petroglyphs can be found around Tsankawi and for that matter throughout the southwest. Petroglyphs are designs carved into the stone. The ones presented here are located along the cliffs and in some of the cave dwellings. Unfortunately, the carvings were made in the soft tuff stone which easily erodes. Many of the drawings have become difficult to see or have disappeared altogether. Some of the meanings of the figures are known among modern-day Indians and are culturally significant to them. Other petroglyphs, we can only speculate about what the people were trying to say. Among the petroglyphs are figures of people, animals, birds, four pointed stars and other designs. Similar carvings in tuff stone can be found at Frijoles canyon and an extensive collection of petroglyphs can be found south of Bandelier National Monument at Petroglyph National Monument.  Duchess castle  Remains of Duchess Castle, looking toward the northeast. To the northeast are the remains of a home and school built by Madame (not actually a duchess but a baroness) Vera von Blumenthal and her friend Rose Dougan in 1918. They provided instruction to the potters of local pueblos on how to revive techniques with the intent of making the pottery more collectable, which would, in turn, provide income to the pueblo community.

Kadavas were related to the Pallava dynasty and ruled from Kudalur near Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. Hiranyavarman, the father of Nandivarman II Pallavamalla is said to have belonged to the Kadavakula in epigraphs. Nandivarman II himself is described as \\"one who was born to raise the prestige of the Kadava family\\". Chiefs bearing the Kadava title figure as feudatories of the Cholas as early as the 12th century. During the reign of Kulothunga Chola II, there was a vassal called Palli Alappirandan Elisaimohan alias Kulottungasola Kadavaradittan. The Kadava kingdom was at the height of their power briefly during the reigns of Kopperunchinga I and Kopperunchinga II. These two rulers were powerful enough to challenge the waning Chola dynasty during the reign of Rajaraja Chola III and Rajendra Chola III. The two Kopperunchingas have left a large number of inscriptions mostly in the North and South Arcot districts and in the Chingleput district. Origins The title Kadava is found among the several titles assumed by Mahendravarman I, Narasimhavarman I and Narasimhavarman II. The Kadava name with Kadavarayar and Tondaiyar, is found in Tamil literature to refer to the Pallavas. The relationship of the Kadavas to the main Pallava dynasty is documented in an inscription in Kanchipuram. The kings of the collateral line of the Pallavas who were descended from Bhimavarman, the brother of Simhavishnu, are called the Kadavas. The Pallava king Nandivarman II (Pallavamalla) is praised as \\"one who was born to raise the prestige of the Kadava family.\\"Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955).

Premiering on September 9, 1967, this 60-minute program included a series of six-minute adventures featuring various DC Comics superheroes. Overview Each episode consisted of new segments from the existing series, The New Adventures of Superman and The Adventures of Superboy, as well as outings for Aquaman and his sidekick Aqualad. Superman fans generally regard it as the second season of The New Adventures. As a part of The New Adventures, it is notable for containing some of the final work done by Bud Collyer, the voice actor who had originated the roles of Superman and Clark Kent on radio. It also included a rotating series of \\"guest star\\" cartoons featuring the Atom, the Flash and Kid Flash, the Green Lantern, Hawkman and new shorts from The Adventures of Superboy. The Justice League of America (Atom, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Aquaman and Superman) and Teen Titans (Speedy, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl, and Aqualad, but not Robin) were also featured in team adventures. Many of the shorts were penned and script-edited by DC Comics employees. Bob Haney and George Kashdan ‚Äî the writing-editing team who were then producing the original version of the Teen Titans comic book ‚Äî were prolific on the series, taking on nearly all the \\"guest star\\" cartoons. Mort Weisinger, editor of all Superman comic titles during the 1960s, served as script editor for the shorts featuring Kal-El. This use of comic writers on the television series tended to make them \\"a very faithful adaption to the comic book mythos.\\" Even so, there were some elements which were unique to the cartoons, such as secondary characters in the Hawkman, Green Lantern and Atom shorts. This series marked the animation debut of nearly all of its featured characters and teams. The exceptions were Superman and his supporting cast, who had been previously immortalized in the iconic 1940s Superman shorts (and later in The New Adventures of Superman), and the Superboy characters, seen in the previous season of The Adventures of Superboy. Legacy Due to the success of the show, Filmation had produced a Metamorpho pilot and planned pilots for Plastic Man and Wonder Woman. A DC Comics cartoon hour was also being developed, with concept drawings featuring Metamorpho, Plastic Man, The Flash, The Blackhawks, the Doom Patrol, B'wana Beast and the Metal Men. Plans were cancelled when CBS secured the animation rights to Batman in the wake of ABC's recent success with the Batman live action television series. Subsequently, in 1968, the series became The Batman/Superman Hour, with new Superman/Superboy and Batman segments. Previously-aired Aquaman shorts were repackaged into the 30-minute Aquaman, which also included the existing guest star segments from The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure. The series would be parodied in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"Classic Titans\\". Decades later, the show's format was copied by Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Bros. Television, which created The New Batman/Superman Adventures, a show which united episodes of Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series into one hour of episodes utilizing old episodes of both shows with new episodes. This show ran on The WB's Saturday morning block, Kids' WB, from 1997-2000. Influence The show continued to evolve a narrative format that had been started with the original Superman radio show, featuring a narrator who served to both compress and dramatize the storytelling. Whereas the first season of The New Adventures of Superman had featured longtime radio narrator, Jackson Beck, The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure was the first to feature actor Ted Knight, who had made his Filmation debut as the narrator of the Adventures of Superboy segments late in the previous season of The New Adventures of Superman. Knight would become the main voice used in the narration of DC cartoons for over a decade, and remained the unofficial \\"voice of DC\\" even during the first year the cartoons were produced by Hanna-Barbera under the Super Friends banner.

The highest peak in the range, it rises to 288 metres above sea level and overlooks Taupiri township immediately to its south. It is separated from the HƒÅkarimata Range to the south by the Taupiri Gorge, through which the Waikato River flows from the Waikato Basin to the Lower Waikato. The Mangawara Stream joins the Waikato River at the base of the hill. Mount Taupiri is a sacred mountain and burial ground for the Waikato tribe of the MƒÅori people. Until sometime in the 19th century a large MƒÅori village or town, Kaitotehe, stood on the flat land on the other side of the river, below the HƒÅkarimata Range. In early years it was the home of Paoa, brother of Mahuta, before Paoa moved to Hauraki. It became the headquarters of the NgƒÅti Mahuta people. Brothers Whare and Tapuae, grandsons of Mahuta and the leaders of NgƒÅti Mahuta, lived there. After the two brothers were killed, Tapuae's son Te Putu built Taupiri pƒÅ on the summit of a spur of Taupiri mountain, in the 1600s. When Te Putu was an old man in the 1700s, he was treacherously killed by NgƒÅtokowaru of NgƒÅti Raukawa at Te Mata-o-tutonga, his home outside the pƒÅ by the banks of the Waikato River. He was buried at the pƒÅ, which thus became tapu (sacred) and was abandoned. Early European travellers in the area were obliged by MƒÅori to cross to the other side of the Waikato River to avoid the sacred area. In the early 19th century Kaitotehe was the home of P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero, the paramount chief of NgƒÅti Mahuta who became the first MƒÅori King. English explorer and artist George French Angas visited Kaitotehe in 1844 and painted a scene depicting a hui (meeting) taking place in the village. Taupiri mountain is seen in the background on the other side of the Waikato River (which is not visible below the far palisade). The lower peak on the far right shows signs of the terraces of Te Putu's abandoned pƒÅ. To its left, in about the middle of the painting, is a still-lower bush-clad hill, which was the burial ground in Te Putu's time and below which his home of Te Mata-o-tutonga stood. The present-day burial ground is directly above State Highway 1 and the North Island Main Trunk railway line on a steep slope. Parking and access is difficult, because the road and railway lie largely on land at the foot of the slope that has been reclaimed from the river. Access is being improved by a bridge from the township over the Mangawara Stream, open in May 2020. The deceased MƒÅori kings and queen are buried in the highest part of the cemetery, on the summit where Te Putu's pƒÅ stood.

Reception The Allmusic review is quite positive, with reviewer Tracy Frey calling it \\"filled with the band's chaotic, twisted guitars and sarcastic, witty lyrics.\\" The tracks \\"Fractured (Like Chandeliers)\\" and \\"Tragic Carpet Ride\\" were singled out as \\"two amazing guitar songs\\" and \\"Every Holy Shroud\\" was compared to Pavement. Robert Christgau gave the EP a one-star \\"honorable mention\\" indicating \\"a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like\\", picking \\"Fractured (Like Chandeliers)\\" and \\"Every Holy Shroud\\" as highlights and writing: \\"how dark can it be if it's so full of guitars?\\" David Sprague's assessment of the release for Trouser Press is mixed to mildly positive, writing that \\"The energy level is a bit higher [...] but Bowie and Brylawski still noodle with virtually absolute tunnel vision. The fact that both concentrate on fractured chord disseminations (\\"progressions\\" is a bit too linear a description) rather than offer up any tangible leads can create a sort of eustachial whiplash [...].\\" He writes, however, that the \\"band is beginning to show flashes of proficiency at structuring songs\\" and that the EP is more stylistically consistent in comparison to their previous releases. Jon Pareles wrote for The New York Times: \\"where Sonic Youth is thoughtful, Polvo lashes out, surly and cynical. \\"Every Holy Shroud\\" [...] mocks rock critics as it declares, \\"I know who it sounds like, I hope they care,\\" amid guitar parts that turn tangles into snarls [...] Polvo's Sonic Youth roots are clear but unremarkable; Polvo takes the ideas in new directions.\\" Legacy Ryan Adams listed the EP as one of ten records that changed his life, writing: \\"Their first record was good, but this was better, because it was so scrappy. People said Polvo sounded like Sonic Youth, but I always thought they had their own thing going on. This was like music from a cartoon.\\" As of January 2019, Celebrate the New Dark Age is the second highest ranked EP and the 7th highest ranked release (including all formats) to be classified as math rock on the user-controlled database Rate Your Music.

Panama has gone to 4 preolympic tournaments, 5 pre-world championships, one world championship (Japan)in 2006, and one youth basketball olympics (Singapore 2010)since the year 2000. The local program is based in neighborhood leagues that collect talent and export it to the United States. This symbiotic philosophy produces back the talent for the National Team. Usually underrated and underestimated, Panama Basketball always manages to qualify to big tournaments and give stunning surprises, such as beating the United States in the Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2007. Its long basketball tradition dating back to 1904, and its street basketball mentality of fighting hard to the end in basketball games, has made this Central American basketball program a \\"Classic\\" in the international scene.

The following month, he competed at December to Dismember 1995, losing to Taz, and Holiday Hell 1995, where he lost to Bruiser Mastino.

He re-debuted on the August 16, 1998 episode of Sunday Night Heat under the name of \\"Abu\\" (later \\"Babu\\"). His gimmick was that of a manservant to Tiger Ali Singh. He was often seen doing degrading things for Singh. Although most of his stint in WWF was in a non-wrestling role, he did have a few televised matches: on the November 3, 1998 edition of Monday Night Raw, he was ordered by Tiger Ali Singh to wrestle Al Snow, though Singh reentered and won the match; on the December 6, 1998 edition of WWE Sunday Night Heat, he teamed with Singh to wrestle Kurrgan and Luna Vachon, with the match ending in a no-contest.

In 2003 and 2004, he wrestled for World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico and won their World Junior Heavyweight Championship three times. From 2005 to 2006, M√°rquez wrestled in the Puerto Rican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Association. M√°rquez currently wrestles, and teaches for the Main Event Training Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His first major storyline in CCW began when he got involved in a kayfabe fight confrontation between Cash Money Alex G, the head trainer of CCW's Bodyslam University, training facility, and several female graduates of the training program. When Alex G attacked the women, M√°rquez defended them, offering to train them himself. He also challenged Alex G to a match on September 29, 2007, in which he defeated Alex G.

Although a slaveholder, he was loyal to the Union during the American Civil War, raising the 9th Kentucky Cavalry for its defense. Due to his supporting the Democratic Party candidacy of George B. McClellan for the presidency in 1864, in addition to other differences, Kentucky Governor Thomas Bramlette ordered Jacob arrested by the Union commander and expelled from the state during the war, sending him to Richmond, Virginia. Jacob appealed to President Abraham Lincoln and was allowed to return to Kentucky. Background and early life Richard Taylor Jacob was born in Oldham County, Kentucky, to an influential family. His father, John J. Jacob (1770‚Äì1852), was a well-known businessman and real estate speculator; his brother, Charles Donald Jacob, eventually served three terms as mayor of Louisville; and his sister, Susan, married James Brown Clay, son of statesman Henry Clay. James Clay later was elected as a U.S. Representative from Kentucky. Richard Jacob studied law in 1825 and visited South America. He happened to be in California when the Bear Flag Revolt broke out. He joined the cavalry forces of General John C. Fremont and served as a captain. When Fremont was on trial in Washington, D.C. for his actions in California, Jacob appeared as a witness on the general's behalf. At that time, Jacob met Fremont's sister-in-law, Sarah Benton, a daughter of Senator Thomas Hart Benton; the couple married in January 1848. For a few years Jacob farmed in Missouri, his wife's home state. In 1855 Jacob bought a farm called \\"Woodland\\" on the Ohio River in Oldham County, Kentucky, and moved there with his family. He called the farm 'Clifton' while living there. Civil War In 1859 Jacob was elected as a Democrat to Kentucky's state legislature. In 1860, Jacob supported John C. Breckinridge for president. But when the American Civil War broke out, he remained loyal to the Union and worked to prevent Kentucky from seceding and joining the Confederacy. In 1862, he raised the 9th Kentucky Cavalry, a regiment of 1,244 men. Over the next year, he took part in several skirmishes and battles, including resisting Morgan's Raid in 1863. That year, Jacob was elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky, as the running mate of Thomas E. Bramlette. The partnership between the two men did not last long. Jacob attacked the Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1863, considering it unfair to those Kentucky slave-holders who remained loyal to the Union as it did not provide compensation for freeing slaves. Adding to Jacob's troubles, his wife Sarah died that year. In 1864 Jacob supported General George B. McClellan's candidacy for the presidency. General Stephen G. Burbridge, the Union commander of the district of Kentucky, had caused much controversy and opposition in the state for his heavy-handed tactics, including execution of suspected spies on flimsy evidence. Trying to ensure a Lincoln win in the state, Burbridge arrested Jacob for his attacks on the Lincoln administration and sent him through the Confederate lines to Richmond, Virginia. He also arrested Judge Bullitt. Jacob denied that he ever spoke against the Union and appealed to President Lincoln. Apparently, Lincoln believed Jacob, or at least sought to placate Jacob's supporters in Kentucky. The president allowed Jacob to visit Washington, DC and gave him a letter securing his release. Jacob returned to his home state. In 1865 he married again, to Laura Wilson. Later years Later, Jacob ran for Congress (1867) and for an appellate clerkship, but he lost both elections. In 1876 he was elected judge of the Oldham County court, but declined to run for a second term. At about this time, Jacob joined the Republican Party. From 1895 to 1899, he served as park commissioner of Louisville. Trivia * Richard Taylor Jacob's father, John Jeremiah Jacob (1770‚Äì1852), should not be confused with Richard's distant cousin, also named John J. Jacob (1829‚Äì1893), who served as Governor of West Virginia. * In 1996 Jacob's former farm, \\"Clifton,\\" became the site of a commercial bison farm.

The gelding was sired by Affirmed, the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing winner, out of the unplaced Lizzie Rolfe by Tom Rolfe, who was an exceptional racehorse but a better broodmare sire. He was retired at the age of 9 due to complications following exploratory surgery on an ankle. Breeding A dark brown gelding, The Tin Man was bred and raced by Ralph and Aury Todd (who live in California's Santa Ynez Valley). His sire never ran on grass, but his descendants proved themselves on the turf. Affirmed's daughter Flawlessly twice earned Eclipse Awards as Champion Grass Female, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame. One of his top sons, Charlie Barley, was a Canadian Turf Champion. The Todds bought a mare called Dancin' Liz, by Northern Dancer. She became a stakes winner and a stakes producer, with foals including the Grade II winner Oraibi, by Forli. She also dropped a Skywalker foal: the stakes-placed gelding Santero. Her filly by Tom Rolfe is The Tin Man's dam. The Tin Man was Lizzie Rolfe's ninth live foal. She died in 2000 giving birth to a full sister to The Tin Man. This sister is called She's a Rich Girl. Early career As a two-year-old, The Tin Man bowed both tendons, injuries that required surgical repair. This early injury sidelined him for a lengthy period. \\"He had some injuries that would've stopped some horses along the way,\\" said trainer Richard Mandella,. \\"His body must have a great ability to overcome them.\\" Mandella also decided to geld him. \\"I thought it might be a good idea to geld him for two reasons. First, it keeps them from developing that heavy chest, heavy neck, and that's 60 or 75 pounds of weight up front that you keep off. The second part was that he might behave himself better and have less chance to injure himself than a colt would.\\" At 4: He won the Grade I Clement L. Hirsch Memorial Turf Championship Stakes and the Grade II American Handicap. He placed in the Grade II Del Mar Handicap and came in third in the Grade III San Francisco Breeders' Cup. All of these races were on the turf. At 5: He won the Grade II San Luis Obispo Handicap and placed in the Grade I United Nations Handicap. These races were also on the turf. Later career Due to an ankle injury suffered in the Hirsch, thereby incurring major soft-tissue damage, The Tin Man was away from the races for fifteen months. He spent that time at River Edge Farm near Buellton, California, where the Todds board their mares. The owners often went to see him. \\"He's a dandy,\\" says Ralph Todd, \\"...we'd go to visit, and as soon as he saw us, he'd come right over.\\" Mandella said, \\"When we started him back, he just got better and better.\\" At 7: He won at Santa Anita Park in December 2005 in an allowance race in his first race back. At 8: In January 2006, he took the Grade IIT San Marcos Handicap. A runner up in the Grade I Dubai Duty Free Stakes in the United Arab Emirates, he then, ridden by Victor Espinoza, wired the Grade I Arlington Million on turf and won the Grade II American Handicap. After the Arlington Million, Mandella said he'd consider the 2006 running of the Breeders' Cup Turf. (The Tin Man had twice run fourth in the BC Turf.) Mandella's win in the Arlington was his seventh attempt. \\"I've been trying to win this race for a long time, and it's nice to finally win it,\\" said Mandella. \\"The Tin Man has been around for a long time. He's a pretty cool guy.\\" With his second win in the September 30, 2006, Clement L. Hirsch Memorial Turf Championship Stakes, The Tin Man reached $3,126,860 in earnings. He also beat John Henry's record as the oldest horse to win the Hirsch (known, in John's day, as the Oak Tree Turf). Richard Mandella opted to keep The Tin Man out of the Breeders' Cup Turf in 2006, saying he would start him in the Citation Handicap for the first time. But after some disappointing workouts, Mandella gave his horse the rest of the year off. In 2006, The Tin Man was under consideration for Eclipse honors. 2007 season In early February 2007, The Tin Man re-entered training. He won the Grade I Shoemaker Mile, Hollywood's Memorial Day feature, defeating Kip Deville for his fourth straight win. Sweeping wide from a position just off the pace entering the stretch, The Tin Man rallied and drew clear. With this win, he became the first horse in North America to win a Grade I stakes race at 9 since John's Call won two such races in 2000. \\"It's just phenomenal that he's stayed so good after all these years,\\" said Mandella after the victory. On June 30, The Tin Man finished second in the American Invitational Handicap, losing by a head to the Brazilian colt Out of Control. The Tin Man carried 10 more pounds, and Mandella said a key workout leading into the race had not gone well. \\"There was a loose horse on the track, and he didn't get much out of a work that he really needed.\\" The Tin Man was the defending champion when he returned to the Arlington Million on August 11, 2007. No other horse in the 25 yr old signature race at Arlington Park had ever won it back to back years, and only John Henry had won it at age 9. Going off as the betting favorite, he took the lead after the last turn, on the softer turf ground, but was overtaken by the Canadian gelding Jambalaya, losing by 3/4 of a length in a time of 2:04:76, paying $3.80 and $2.60, and elevating his career earnings to $3,613,780. His final start of 2007 - and final start of his career - took place in the Grade 1 Oak Tree $250k Clement L. Hirsch Turf Championship Stakes held at Santa Anita October 6 at 1 miles. As the 3-5 favorite, he lost by one length to six-year-old Artiste Royal, who had previously been 0 for 9 in starts in the US. The Tin Man's 2007 record was 4 starts 1-3-0 with the victory being a Grade 1 and his second-place finishes being 2 Grade 1s and 1 Grade 2. Surgery and retirement The Tin Man emerged from his final race on October 6 with body soreness. Despite his age, Mandella hoped that the horse could return in 2008 and race as a 10-year-old. He was taken out of training and his owners sent him in for exploratory tests. Among the test findings were suggestions of possible damage to an ankle, which resulted in an exploratory arthroscopic procedure. On October 25, 2007, The Tin Man underwent the procedure without issue. However, when coming out of anesthesia, he spooked and fractured his knee. The injury was serious enough for the owners and trainer to retire The Tin Man. They made the announcement on October 31, 2007. On April 14, 2008, The Tin Man arrived at Martin and Pam Wygod's River Edge Farm near Buellton, California. His movements are a bit constricted due to calcium deposits on his knee, but solutions were sought. \\"He's had trouble with that knee...it has definitely cramped his lifestyle a little bit, but he gets around fairly well,\\" said Russell Drake, River Edge farm manager. \\"Right now, I've got him out in a big, grass paddock, and his main thing is to just eat and be happy for a while. He's just one of those upbeat little guys that loves to eat grass, be in the sun, and have a good time.\\"The Horse: Veteran Campaigner The Tin Man Retired, Recovering from Fracture The Tin Man died in April 2015.

He is a left-handed batsman who bowls right-arm off break. He was born at Herning. Early career Having played cricket since he was nine and represented Denmark at Under-19 level, Pedersen made his full debut for Denmark in a List A match against Northamptonshire in the 2005 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy at Svanholm Park, Br√∏ndby. It was an unsuccessful debut for Pedersen, with him contributing 4 runs in Denmark's total of 56, before he became one of Charl Pietersen's six wickets. Later that year, he appeared in the ICC Trophy in Ireland. The International Cricket Council afforded List A status to these matches, with him making seven appearances during the tournament. Pedersen fared moderately with the bat, scoring 76 runs at an average of 19.00, with a high score of 26. In 2006, Pedersen joined the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketer's programme. The following year, he was selected as part of Denmark's squad for the World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia, making four List A appearances during the tournament. He struggled with the bat, scoring 34 runs at an average of 8.50. In 2009, he was selected in Denmark's squad for the World Cup Qualifier in South Africa, where he made seven List A appearances, including his final appearance to date in that format, against Oman. He scored 292 runs during the tournament at average of 41.71, with a high score of 121. This was his maiden List A century and came against the Netherlands. He also made two half centuries during the tournament and ended it as Denmark's leading run-scorer, ahead of his brother Carsten who made 234 runs. Despite this, Denmark failed to qualify for the 2011 World Cup and finished the tournament in 16th and last place. Danish captaincy In 2011, Pedersen was selected to captain Denmark's squad for the 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament in Hong Kong, having replaced Frederik Klokker in the role. He made six appearances during the tournament, scoring 164 runs at an average of 32.80, with a high score of 78 not out.

Later in 2011, he captained Denmark in the European T20 Championship Division One which was held in Jersey and Guernsey, which Denmark won to qualify for the World Twenty20 Qualifier in the United Arab Emirates. The qualifier took part in March 2012, with Pedersen retained as captain in Denmark's fourteen man squad for the qualifier. He made his Twenty20 debut during the tournament against Bermuda at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium. He made seven further appearances during the competition, the last of which came against Oman. He scored a total of 108 runs during the qualifier at an average of 15.42, with a high score of 38. He also took 2 wickets, at a bowling average of 63.00 and with best figures of 1/12. Denmark once again struggled during a qualifying tournament, finishing it in 16th and last place.

Most of the story seems to occur in and around Kilkenny; indeed the \\"Ballygran\\" referred to in the song may be the local Ballingarry coal mines. \\"Marble...black as ink\\" is also mined locally. It was first recorded, under the name \\"The Kerry Boatman\\", by Dominic Behan on an LP called The Irish Rover, released in 1965.\\"The Irish Rover\\", published by Doug Dobell, no. F-LEUT-2 An almost identical version was recorded afterwards by the Clancy brothers. Origins The origins of the song are unclear, but the melody has been traced to an Irish-language song, \\"Do Bh√≠ Bean Uasal\\" (\\"There Was a Noblewoman\\"), which is attributed to the poet Cathal Bu√≠ Mac Giolla Ghunna, who died in 1756 in County Clare. Music collector George Petrie obtained two settings of this melody from fellow collector Patrick Joyce. Joyce came from Ballyorgan in the Ballyhoura Mountains, on the borders of counties Limerick and Cork. Petrie wrote that he believed \\"Do Bh√≠ Bean Uasal\\" came from either County Clare or County Limerick, and was in any case a Munster song.George Petrie: Ancient Music of Ireland, M. H. Gill, Dublin, 1855 (re-printed 2005, University of Leeds, ) A version of the song appeared on a ballad sheet in Cork City in the mid nineteenth century in macaronic form. The Irish lyrics were about a man being cuckolded, a bawdy and humorous ditty. By contrast, the English lyrics are nostalgic. Robert Gogan50 Great Irish Love Songs. Music Ireland, 2008 suggests Carrickfergus may have evolved from at least two separate songs, which would explain why it does not have a consistent narrative. For example, the Ancient Music of Ireland, published by George Petrie in 1855, contained an Irish-language song called \\"An Bhean Uasal\\" which featured many but not all of the sentiments used in Carrickfergus. Gogan also refers to a recording of a song called \\"Sweet Maggie Gordon\\" which is kept in the Music for the Nation section of the US Library of Congress. It was published by Mrs Pauline Lieder in New York in 1880. It contains verses which are similar to Carrickfergus, but the chorus is closer to another Irish/Scottish folk song called \\"Peggy Gordon\\". In modern times, \\"Carrickfergus\\" became known after actor Peter O'Toole related it to Dominic Behan, who put it in print and made a recording in 1965. In his book, \\"Ireland Sings\\" (London, 1965), Behan gives three verses of which he says, that he obtained two verses from O'Toole and wrote the middle one himself. It is also referenced in the song, \\"Galway Girl\\" written and performed by Ed Sheeran on his 2017 album \\"Divide\\". Performances The song has been recorded by many well known performers. It is a popular request at folk festivals and concerts, and was played at the 1999 funeral of John F. Kennedy, Jr. The song was more recently performed by Loudon Wainwright III over the closing credits of an episode of HBO's series Boardwalk Empire.https://web.archive.org/web/20151226055910/http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk- empire/episodes/01/05-nights-in-ballygran/music.html Furthermore, the Russian singer-songwriter Aleksandr Karpov (a.k.a. \\"Aleksandr O'Karpov\\") translated the lyrics into Russian, recording a Russian version of \\"Carrickfergus\\", also titled ( - \\"Beyond the blue sea, beyond the ocean\\"). The song \\"The Water is Wide\\" has a similar tune and very similar lyrics in some lines. Recordings have been made by many people including Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, The Seekers and two former members of The Byrds, Roger Mcguinn and Chris Hillman, who both did solo versions. Bryan Ferry also did a version on his 1978 album The Bride Stripped Bare.

Many of the collection's mechanical instruments are rare; a number are among only a few manufactured, and a few are among the last in existence. Although the collection‚Äôs value cannot be measured, an offer for a sum of multiple millions of dollars was once rejected. History Dairy farmers Jake and Elizabeth DeBence began their collection in the 1940s in Grove City, Pennsylvania. The DeBences became avid auction attendees after purchasing two Tiffany style lamps for a low cost. The collection continued to grow and to this day donations are still accepted. When the DeBences retired to Franklin, Pennsylvania in 1965, they housed the collection in their barn a few miles outside of town and opened it to public viewing as the DeBence Music Museum. After Jake's death in March 1992, Elizabeth put the collection up for sale, and a Japanese interest offered her $13 million. Feeling that her husband would have wanted the collection to remain intact and in the area, she turned them down. She contacted the Chamber of Commerce and Local residents formed a non-profit organization (Oil Region Music Preservation Museum)that raised $1 million in a little more than seven months to buy the collection. The effort included selling wooden music notes for placement in storefronts and local yards as a show of support for keeping the collection in Franklin. The museum is housed in the location of the former G.C. Murphy five and dime store on Liberty Street. DeBence Antique Music World opened for tours in 1994. In addition to the musical instruments, the collection includes a large number of antiques the DeBences collected, and they are displayed along with other items that have musical or local significance. The DeBences' collection of more than 40 Tiffany-style hanging lamps provide the museum‚Äôs lighting. Collection * The Berry-Wood A.O.W. Orchestrion a nickelodeon that features 10 instruments played by a paper roll, is the last functioning one of its kind in existence. Built by the Berry-Wood piano company of Kansas, very few of this model were made. First introduced in 1912 the A.O.W. was the largest model made by Berry- Wood. Jake DeBence was once offered a large sum of money for it. * The 1850 Mandoline Basse music box from Switzerland, the collection's oldest piece, has enameled metal bumble-bees that strike bells, accompanying the music of a spinning metal cylinder. * The hand-wound 1901 Gem Organette, which cost $3.25 in the Sears catalog, was an inexpensive alternative to a music box and/or phonograph. The Gem Organette was one of the first music machines that was mass-produced. The music \\"cobs\\" cost 18 cents each, and the cobs and possibly a machine were available for free with the purchase of five pounds of flour. * The Regina Grand music box plays a melody from over one hundred years ago. As the music is played by the huge 27\\" disc, the music is beautifully resonated by a solid mahogany case. It also features a coin slot and built in storage compartment. * The Mills Novelty Company's Violano Virtuoso was so popular in 1911 that President of the United States William Howard Taft named it one of the eight greatest inventions of the decade. The machine features a violin played by rolls with piano accompanimen. The Machine is supposed to be held in tune by lead weights, but over time the weights have slipped. * Among the collection's Antique record Players, two models feature table top attachments that use power from the record to make dolls dance to the music. The figures are often worth more than the machines because they were considered toys and would often be destroyed. * The Artizan Air-Calio Calliope from 1927 is one of only three such machines ever manufactured; although there is no record of a third machine even being made, there are 3 in existence. It operates from a special style roll or WurliTzer APP Roll but only reversed. * The Wurlitzer Style 65 Band Organ is a one of a kind model in which no other was known to be produced. It is fully chromatic which means that it can play in every key. The organ was last publicly used on the Carousel at Cabana Beach Park in Washington, Pennsylvania. * The Wurlitzer 153 Band Organ was originally used on the Carousel at Idora Park, Youngstown in Ohio. The machine features metal bells on the front of the machine that accompany the music. This was one of the most popular models produced by the Wurlitzer company. * The Wurlitzer Pianino is one of the fewer than two dozen that remain. It has flute and violin pipes that accompany to 44 note half piano. These were one of the Wurlitzer company's first experiments into mechanical pianos. * The Cremona \\"J\\" Tall Case is one of only a few manufactured.

He is a child killer and a recurring villain in the series. Publication history =Kiddie Killer= In Spawn #5, Kincaid is released from a mental institution, where he had been placed because he was suspected of murdering several children. The most notable of the cases, and the only one Kincaid was actually charged with, was the disappearance and murder of a senator's daughter. In his previous life as Al Simmons, Spawn had been hired to kill Kincaid, but had arrived just as Kincaid was apprehended by the police and so was unable to complete the mission. Upon his release from the institution, Kincaid immediately goes back to kidnapping and murdering children by luring them into his ice cream truck. He kills a child before Spawn gives him a fitting, but gruesome death: stabbed with an ice cream scooper, and popsicle sticks, with a note pinned to his torso. Spawn hangs his bloody corpse in the precinct office of detectives Sam Burke and Twitch Williams, who had been investigating Kincaid, the note reading: \\"Boys screamed and girls screamed. So I made him scream, and scream, and scream...\\" Both Sam and Twitch are consequently blamed for the gruesome incident and put on probation, though this is eventually cleared. =In Hell= Kincaid wakes up in Hell, in a necro-tree pod. He meets a team of people and they travel together. As each are taken one by one by demons, until only Kincaid and a little girl is left. While trying to strangle the girl, she reveals herself to be The Vindicator, brother of The Violator. The Vindicator gives Kincaid a \\"tour\\" of Hell and the various spheres of Hell in a giant tower. He leads Kincaid to the Eighth Circle of Hell, the place where Al Simmons made a deal with Malebolgia to become a Hellspawn. Kincaid is fitted with K3-Myrlu, a necroplasm-based, female, symbiote suit, which The Vindicator says \\"likes\\" Kincaid. The suit sexually bonds herself to Kincaid. He is then informed that he is now an officer, in the service of Satan's Army. In Spawn #53, Spawn returns to Hell, where he battles the newly empowered Kincaid. It is a quick battle, as Spawn easily defeats Kincaid and severs his head. =Kincaid's Return= After a series of seemingly senseless and brutal crimes, Spawn (with the aid of Sam, Twitch, and his mentor, Cogliostro) discovers that Kincaid's ghost is forcing people into acting out their most violent impulses. These senseless crimes hit close to home, as a number of homeless people are savagely murdered. Spawn and the detectives are helpless to stop Kincaid as he jumps from body to body and continues to indirectly cause these senseless crimes. With each murder, Kincaid not only damns the innocent souls coerced into committing the crimes, but grows stronger himself. Eventually, Spawn leads Kincaid, inhabiting a police officer, into the Dead Zone, an area of the bowery where Heaven reigns supreme and Hell has no power. Now depowered, both Spawn and Kincaid fight each other hand-to-hand. During the melee, Twitch fires a single shot into the cop's forehead, killing the cop and the depowered Kincaid simultaneously. Kincaid makes another brief appearance as a denizen of Hell in Spawn #100, as Spawn passes him on the way to battle Malebolgia. =Issue #150= Kincaid reappeared in Spawn #150 to torment Christopher, the lost soul sealed within Spawn's heart. Christopher is given the form and powers of a Hellspawn by the mysterious Man of Miracles, and eventually runs afoul of Kincaid, who operates a toystore filled with Spawn action figures. In later issues, Christopher confronts Kincaid again at a diabolical carnival revealed to be a portal to Hell. Kincaid forces Christopher to watch every murder he commits. Christopher's eyes burn out of their sockets, and his female, necroplasmic uniform then tears Kincaid apart, protecting her beloved host. =Recent Activity= Kincaid returns in Issue 306 where he is plotting to kill spawn and Raptor with someone.In 307 it's revealed that Billy now shorted his name to just Kincaid reborn as a hellspawn once more. Appearances in other media * Billy Kincaid was featured heavily in the first season of the HBO animated series Todd McFarlane's Spawn. In the series (voiced by Ronnie Cox), he was a senator's son and was protected by his remorseful father and Jason Wynn. Clown gave Kincaid Cyan's address and he kidnapped her, and was later beaten by Spawn, who then takes Cyan home safely. At the end, Clown angrily kills the mortally wounded Billy with a gun after seeing Spawn leaving him for dead rather than kill him himself, much to Clown's frustration and dismay. * Kincaid is the subject of American metal band Iced Earth's song \\"Vengeance Is Mine\\".

Founded in 1971, it was among the first six tribal colleges and universities (TCU) in the United States, and the first established in California. It was not affiliated with a single federally recognized tribe or reservation, as are numerous other tribal colleges. The school ended its full-time class schedule in 2005 due to loss of accreditation. The Board of Trustees has been enlarged and continues to arrange activities to maintain its non-profit status. Students and instructors who remained on campus have continued to use the campus for classes, gatherings, and ceremonies, with annual powwows held through 2013. Annual Veterans Day powwows have continued to be held through the most recent Veteran's Day in 2017. Name The school was named by founders as Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University, after two great Native American leaders of the period before European contact, one from New York and one from Mexico.Hindery, Robin. \\"California's only tribal college close to collapse after 35 years\\", North County Times, 13 Aug 2006 (retrieved 30 Aug 2009) According to Iroquois leaders, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive because the first part of the name should be used only in an appropriate spiritual context. Therefore, it is usually referred to as D‚ÄìQ University to avoid offense. Iroquois tribal members, in certain circumstances, may use the full name. Mission At a time of rising American Indian activism, the college was founded to provide alternative ideas and methods of education to Native American and Chicano students. Among its goals were to preserve and strengthen traditional Native American values, practice and protect Native American religion and beliefs, establish a Native American Research Institute, develop field-based systems to provide education to Native Americans who could not attend classes at the campus, and maintain social and personal support systems for D-Q students and staff. History Founded in 1971, D-Q was the only college in California founded by and for Native Americans. The school was one of the first six tribal colleges and universities in the United States, all of which were founded between 1968 and 1972. It was the only one that was independent of a reservation. Those six colleges created the American Indian Higher Education Consortium in 1972. In the 21st century, the U.S. Department of Education recognizes 34 tribal colleges, the majority of which are two-year institutions located on reservations. They now enroll more than 30,000 students, and some institutions have formal agreements with four-year universities to enable students to pursue BA degrees. The site of D-Q was previously used as a United States Army communications facility, known at various times as the Sacramento Valley Radio Transmitting Station; West Coast Relay and Transmitter Station; U.S. Army West Coast Relay and Radio Transmitting Station; and the U.S. Army Strategic Communications Command - CONUS, Davis California, Facility. The site was also used at one time by the Department of the Army, Signal Corps, to support the Signal Corps Radio Station WVY. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw Native American groups 'occupying' federal lands (Alcatraz Island is the best-known Northern California example) as a form of protest, and the US Army high frequency transmit and control site near Davis was no exception. Conveniently for all parties, the US Army radio transmitter & control site mostly deactivated and operating in a caretaker status, as part of an military-wide reorganization of high frequency radio facilities (similar high-power Army HF radio stations in Kansas and the Washington DC area also had shut-down), so while the occupation may have provided a slight nuisance, the Army chose not to attempt to forcibly repel the occupiers, like they certainly would have been obligated to if the site was still performing an important mission and with expensive, classified materials stored on-site. As-of 2005, numerous items on the D-Q campus‚Äîsuch as chairs, tables, etc. still had US Army property markings, and the surrounding open fields (the former HF radio \\"antenna farm\\") still had 1.5\\" thick, armored coax-cables that used to connect the antennas with the transmitters buried in the soil, and graffiti from the early 1970s occupation was extant in some buildings.Per personal guided tour led by then D-Q U President & facilities manager for me, a military communications site historian. A group of Native American academics, including David Risling, Jack D. Forbes, Carl Gorman, Kenneth Martin, and Sarah Hutchison, all of whom were involved in the Native American Studies Department at UC Davis, created a Board of Trustees to apply for use of the site after the federal government decommissioned the site for military use. The University of California had also applied to use the site: for its new Native American Studies program, established in 1969, and a primate research lab. Organizers protested and UC Davis withdrew its application. The federal government conditionally granted the land to D‚ÄìQ University in 1971. The school opened in 1971, founded to serve both Native American and Latino students. It obtained accreditation in 1977. Most tribal colleges are affiliated with one federally recognized tribe and are generally located on reservations. Organizers of the college were drawn from Native American activists, many of whom were members of federally recognized tribes in California. They struggled to attract funding and faculty to set up and operate the college, at a time when mainstream universities were also recruiting Native Americans to new programs of studies. Loss of accreditation, 2005 With competition from the growth of Native American programs at other universities, as well as numerous tribal colleges, in the early 21st century D-Q suffered declining enrollment, a high rate of board of trustees turnover, and problems with funding. In 2003-2004, it lost funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs because of insufficient Native American enrollment as well as money from the Department of Education.\\"D-Q University Loses Accreditation, Funding\\", Tribal College/ Journal of American Indian Education, 15 May 2005 It lost its accreditation in 2005 and stopped offering classes. Disputes among the board of trustees were settled following a lawsuit. The university re-opened for some activities later that year, but the board dismissed the president in June 2006 due to continued lack of students and funds. Elders and teachers continued to occupy the University grounds through much of 2008, despite Board and police pressures to vacate the land. During several instances in 2008, students and supporters were arrested for occupying the grounds. The school's community continued to host community events, such as powwows. D‚ÄìQ University in September 2010, in conjunction with the Regenerative Design Institute hosted a Permaculture Design Course.Permaculture and Peacemaking .Peacemaking and Permaculture - Permaculture Design Certification IntensiveThe Aggie: Learn about sustainable living and peacemaking at D-Q University Native Americans and non-Natives collaborated on site development proposals for the campus. Annual powwows have been held through 2013, with representation from tribes across California, as well as from other parts of the United States and other nations. As of 2015, the Board of trustees has been enlarged from four to 14 members (recruitment continues for four positions), increasing the number with professional backgrounds. Members represent numerous tribes in California as well as people from outside the state. Among the committees formed is one for curriculum, with a broad-based effort to assess current needs of Native Americans in California.Patty Talahongva, \\"California Indians Seek to Establish a TCU\\", Tribal College, 2 May 2015 accessed 12 May 2015 The Board has arranged for seminars and other activities to retain the university's non-profit status, while working to improve its infrastructure and build a network of support in 2015 to re-open. In 2012 the Board signed a memorandum of agreement with the Inter-Tribal Council of California toward this goal. Representation in other media In the early 1990s, D-Q University was to be the subject of a feature- length documentary film, A Free People, Free To Choose.W.G.A.W. reg. No. 513853; an overview of the film project was presented and discussed at the D-Q U Board of Trustees' semiannual meeting on October 2, 1993. Distribution interest was in place before any footage was shot; in the 100 plus hours shot and assembled are lengthy interviews with David Risling and Jack D. Forbes. Jan Crull, Jr., the filmmaker, was interested in the college's history. He stopped the project when Morrison & Foerster, a law firm closely linked to D-Q U's legal battles, withdrew after some of the film's subjects became involved in mutual lawsuits. He had already shot more than 100 hours of footage, including interviews with founders and activists David Risling and Jack D. Forbes.

Left to right: Thomas Aquinas, Christ and Pope Pius IX Pastor aeternus (\\"First Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ\\"), was issued by the First Vatican Council, July 18, 1870. The document defines four doctrines of the Catholic faith: the apostolic primacy conferred on Peter, the perpetuity of the Petrine Primacy in the Roman pontiffs, the meaning and power of the papal primacy, and Papal infallibility ‚Äì infallible teaching authority (magisterium) of the Pope. Petrine and papal primacy There is general agreement among scholars on the preeminence that the historical Peter held among the disciples of Jesus, making him \\"the most prominent and influential member of the Twelve during Jesus' ministry and in the early Church\\". Stylianopoulos, Theodore. \\"Concerning the Biblical Foundation of Primacy\\", in Walter Kasper (editor), The Petrine Ministry (Paulist Press 2008 ), pp. 43‚Äì44 > It was to Simon alone, to whom he had already said You shall be called > Cephas, that the Lord,‚Ä¶spoke these words: \\"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona. > For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in > heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my > Church, and the gates of the underworld shall not prevail against it. I will > give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth > shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in > heaven\\".Pastor aeternus, Chapter 1, ¬ß2, July 18, 1870 The Primacy of Simon Peter is closely related to, and indeed essential to, the papal primacy, that is, the idea that the papacy, by divine institution, enjoys delegated authority from Jesus over the entire Church. The primacy of the Bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church, is derived from the pope's status as successor to Peter as \\"Prince of the Apostles\\" and as \\"Vicar of Christ\\" (Vicarius Christi). The First Vatican Council defined papal primacy as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. Magisterium In the Catholic Church, the word \\"Magisterium\\" refers to the teaching authority of the church. This authority is understood to be embodied in the episcopacy, which is the aggregation of the current bishops of the church, led by the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), who has authority over the bishops, individually and as a body, as well as over each and every Catholic directly. > That apostolic primacy which the Roman Pontiff possesses as successor of > Peter, the prince of the apostles, includes also the supreme power of > teaching. This Holy See has always maintained this, the constant custom of > the Church demonstrates it, and the ecumenical councils, particularly those > in which East and West met in the union of faith and charity, have declared > it.Pastor aeternus, Chapter 4, ¬ß1, July 18, 1870 =Ex cathedra= Literally \\"from the chair\\", a theological term which signifies authoritative teaching and is more particularly applied to the definitions given by the Roman pontiff.Pace, Edward. \\"Ex Cathedra.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 8 January 2019 There is a distinction between the Solemn Magisterium and the Ordinary Magisterium. When the Pope issues a dogmatic definition, he is speaking ex cathedra in an exercise of the Solemn Magisterium. The second form of Church teaching, the Ordinary Magisterium is continually exercised by the Church especially in her universal teaching regarding with faith and morals. For a Papal statement to be considered \\"ex cathedra\\" it must be made by the Pope as supreme teacher and pastor of the entire church; it must be on a matter of faith and morals; and it must be definitive, and applicable to the universal church. Sheen, Fulton J., The Mystical Body of Christ, Sheed and Ward, 1935, p. 128 Infallibility The infallibility of the pope was thus formally defined in 1870, although the tradition behind this view goes back much further. In the conclusion of the fourth chapter of its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Pastor aeternus, the First Vatican Council declared the following, with bishops Aloisio Riccio and Edward Fitzgerald dissenting: > ...We teach and define that it is a dogma Divinely revealed that the Roman > pontiff when he speaks ex cathedra, that is when in discharge of the office > of pastor and doctor of all Christians, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic > authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals to be held by the > universal Church, by the Divine assistance promised to him in Blessed Peter, > is possessed of that infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer willed > that his Church should be endowed in defining doctrine regarding faith or > morals, and that therefore such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of > themselves, and not from the consent of the Church, irreformable.Pastor > aeternus, Chapter 4, ¬ß11, July 18, 1870 According to Catholic theology, this is an infallible dogmatic definition by an ecumenical council. Because the 1870 definition is not seen by Catholics as a creation of the Church, but as the dogmatic definition of a truth about the Church Magisterium, Papal teachings made prior to the 1870 proclamation can, if they meet the criteria set out in the dogmatic definition, be considered infallible. Ineffabilis Deus is an example of this. Opposition and criticism The Catholic priest August Bernhard Hasler (d. 3 July 1980) wrote a detailed criticism of the First Vatican Council, presenting the passage of the infallibility definition as orchestrated. translation of Wie Der Papst Unfehlbar Wurde: Macht und Ohnmacht eines Dogmas [How the Pope Became Infallible], R. Piper & Co. Verlag (1979). Mark E. Powell, in his examination of the topic from a Protestant point of view, writes: \\"August Hasler portrays Pius IX as an uneducated, abusive megalomaniac, and Vatican I as a council that was not free. Hasler, though, is engaged in heated polemic and obviously exaggerates his picture of Pius IX. Accounts like Hasler's, which paint Pius IX and Vatican I in the most negative terms, are adequately refuted by the testimony of participants at Vatican I\\".Papal Infallibility: A Protestant Evaluation of an Ecumenical Issue, Published by William B.

Simulations can be run for free, or users can build custom teams consisting of players from any generation and join leagues with their friends for a fee. Results are based on each player's combined stats from previous seasons. The site won the 2005 Webby award as the best sports website and claims more than 600,000 users as of 2009. Company history Founded in 1999, WhatIfSports was a side project of a couple of sports fans working for a computer consulting company in Cincinnati, Ohio. After numerous lunchroom debates on which great historical baseball teams would win if they could play each other, a few guys decided to up the ante. At the height of the dot-com bubble, they decided to undertake the challenge of trying to write an advanced baseball simulator (along the lines of Strat-O-Matic and APBA) that would work on a website. An early version of the baseball simulator was up and running by fall of 1999. The next project was college basketball. Just in time for March Madness in spring of 2000, the college basketball simulator went online. This caught the attention of the local media when the simulator said the University of Cincinnati would have made the Final Four if one of its players, power forward Kenyon Martin, had not broken his leg. While continuing with the consulting work to pay the bills, WhatIfSports remained a side project until the company landed its first major license with Major League Baseball in 2001. The license put the baseball simulator on MLB.com and put WhatIfSports on the map. In the years that followed, the WhatIfSports project began earning more money than the computer consulting work, as more and more companies began trimming back their information technology budgets. In 2003 WhatIfSports was officially incorporated; a growing staff was able to introduce new simulators for football, NBA basketball, hockey, and stock car racing. After two more years of continuous growth, WhatIfSports was acquired by Fox Interactive Media in the fall of 2005. This was around the same time Fox bought other properties such as MySpace, IGN and Scout.com. Games =SimMatchup= The sites SimMatchup feature lets users pit any two teams against each other. The list of MLB teams goes back to the 1885, NFL football teams back to 1941, NHL hockey teams back to 1917, NBA basketball teams back to 1950, and NCAA basketball teams goes back to different years depending on the team. All simulators produce complete box scores and full play-by-play. =SimLeagues= The sites SimLeagues lets users draft their own teams consisting of any player in MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL history and join leagues with other people. All leagues play full seasons (by today's standards) with playoffs. Complete stats are tracked for all players and teams. =Dynasty games= The site has dynasty games for college football, college basketball, soccer and baseball where the user manages a team of fictional players over the course of several seasons. The user controls roster management, game planning, and in the college dynasties can advance from Division III schools up to Division I schools. In those games they have real colleges, but not players. There are other people who are also in the world with you.http://www.whatifsports.com/soccer Forums and other features The site offers extensive user forums for each of the major sports, along with more general discussions and a section called \\"The Pit\\" for trash talk and more mature themes. Generally, the most active forum is Baseball (Sim Baseball and Hardball Dynasty, along with MLB talk.) On August 14, 2007 a soccer forum was introduced to talk about all things soccer. The site also offers a section called \\"Beyond the Box Score\\" which are a series of columns which contain weekly NFL projections on games and individual fantasy football performers, as well as explorations of various \\"what if\\" scenarios. In March 2008, the simulator correctly predicted seven of the eight elite 8 teams, all Final Four teams, the runner-up Memphis and champion Kansas.Beyond the Box Score: Bracket Previewed For a short period of time the site had a Legends Chat. Well-known coaches or athletes would receive questions from users. The questions were screened and had to be submitted the day before the chat. There were only seven of these chats: Davey Johnson (11/28/06), Dan Reeves (12/5/06), Bobby Cremins (12/19/06), Jack Lengyel (1/23/07), John Robinson (2/1/07), John Chaney (2/14/07) and Jud Heathcote (3/7/07). Controversy Fox's acquisition of the site was controversial with some users. There was also a dispute involving copyright issues about Major League Baseball logos and player names and likenesses. When a lawsuit was filed by CDM Fantasy Sports against the Major League Baseball Players Association and Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLB's new media unit) over the use of such material, WhatIfSports eliminated MLB logos and player names and images, substituting generic descriptions of the players. This move generated some controversy with users, though the player names were restored after a federal court decision in favor of CDM Fantasy Sports. The logos have not yet been restored due to continuing copyright concerns.

Biography He was born on March 4, 1906, in Chicago, Illinois, to Charles Rudolph Walgreen and Myrtle Norton. He attended the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy and was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon. Walgreen Jr. started out as a buyer for the company. As head of the company he increased the profit and size of the drug store, encouraged new lines of products to be sold and changed the format from counter service to self-service. He relinquished his role in company in 1969 to his son Charles R. Walgreen III. He died in 2007 at age 100.

It is an east‚Äìwest route running just over from M-66 in East Jordan to US Highway 23 (US 23) in Alpena. It runs via Gaylord and Atlanta through forested terrain. There is one business spur for the highway that currently exists. The highway has been extended a few times during its history, once reaching both lakes Michigan and Huron. Although it is no longer a true \\"cross-peninsular\\" highway, it is close, and there are efforts being made to extend the road back to US 31, restoring the cross-peninsular status lost in 1974 when it was shortened away from Charlevoix.  Route description  M-32 starts at the corner of Lake and Water streets in East Jordan. From there it follows Water, Bridge, Mill and State streets through town. It finally turns south on Maple Street leaving town. The trunkline turns east on Rogers Road south of Patricia Lake and then runs southeast into Antrim County. There it joins US 131 along a concurrency before turning east through Elmira and running east toward Gaylord. North of the Alba Road intersection, M-32 passes a cluster of lakes that includes Lake 27. Continuing east, M-32 crosses through a retail corridor before it passes under Interstate 75 (I-75) and runs into downtown Gaylord with Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). Passing out of Gaylord, the highway runs southeasterly toward Johannesburg. The road passes Big Lake and turns south on Turtle Lake Road at the intersection with Beckett Road. The highway resumes its eastward path on McCoy Road into Johannesburg. It passes through the community and meets the county line in Vienna. There M-32 turns northwesterly to Atlanta. In town, M-32 meets and joins M-33. The two highways cross the Thunder Bay River before parting ways east of Atlanta in Avery Township. M-32 turns north by Fletcher Pond, which straddles the Montmorency‚ÄìAlpena county line. Outside of the village of Hillman, M-32 passes Business M-32 (BUS M-32). In western Alpena County, the trunkline runs to the north of Manning Hill and passes the south end of the Alpena County Regional Airport outside Alpena. In the city, M-32 follows Washington Avenue, then briefly turns onto a one-way pair with eastbound along Second Avenue and westbound along Third Avenue. The end of the highway is at US 23, blocks from the Thunder Bay of Lake Huron. All of M-32 consists of rural two-lane highway outside of the city of Gaylord. The highway passes through forest lands outside of the communities along the highway. From US 131 east to the eastern terminus at US 23, M-32 is listed on the National Highway System (NHS), a group of highways which are determined to be important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The exception is a portion in eastern Otsego and western Montmorency counties, between the corner of Beckett & Turtle Lake Roads, six miles (10 km) east of Gaylord to the crossroads known as Big Rock, five miles (8 km) west of Atlanta.  History  M-32 was formed as a state trunkline in 1919 along its present routing between M-13 (now US 131) and M-10 (later US 23, now M-65) near Lachine. In 1933, M-32 was extended westerly along M-131 and then to M-66 in East Jordan. The concurrency along M-131 would remain when US 131 replaced it in 1939. Another change in that year came on the eastern end when US 23 was realigned north of Alpena. M-32 took over the US 23 routing between Lachine and Alpena. M-32 was extended along M-66 to Charlevoix from 1964 until 1974. Bus. M-32 was disconnected from M-32 when the latter was realigned in Hillman in 1994.  Future  As stated above, a portion of M-32 is not on the NHS. Instead, the Federal Highway Administration map for the NHS in Michigan shows a proposed realignment that has not been built as of 2008. Municipal officials in the Village of Ellsworth have sought an extension of M-32 westward from East Jordan to end at US 31. Such an extension would restore M-32's status as a \\"cross-peninsular\\" highway, making it the 4th if extended.  Major intersections   Business spur  Business M-32 (Bus. M-32) is a business spur route running through Hillman, Michigan. There are markers present, but Bus. M-32 does not connect to M-32. It is the shortest business route in the state, and the second shortest overall trunkline. It is longer than M-212 in Aloha. The termini for Bus. M-32 are Hillman Road and Old M-32 south of Hillman and the northern city limit along Hillman Road. Bus.

It is notable for being the first non-pornographic American film to feature full female nudity. On its reissue in 1918, the film was renamed as The Perfect Model.  Plot  A young sculptor searches for the perfect model to inspire his work. He finds a poverty-stricken girl who he thinks is the one he has been looking for. When she wanders off, he visits all the famous statues in Manhattan hoping to find her again.  Cast  * Audrey Munson as The Model * Thomas A. Curran as The Artist * George Marlo as The Artist's friend * Bert Delaney as The Artist's friend * Carey L. Hastings * Ethyle Cooke * Louise Emerald Bates Release Inspiration was released on November 18, 1915. Thanhouser's publicity department issued a press statement titled \\"Inspiration, a Study in Thanhouser Ideals\\", an interview some newspapers captioned in terms that implied that the studio advocated nudity in motion pictures. Producer Edwin Thanhouser wrote a letter to the editor of The Morning Telegraph to correct that impression: \\"I wish to state that our five- reel Mutual Masterpiece Inspiration was viewed and passed on by the National Board of Censorship without a single alteration.\\" Issuing a pass on Inspiration resulted in changes to the Board. Although the Board had passed the film without any recommended cuts, members criticized the decision, charging the Board with laxness in that Inspiration had been approved too readily. At a meeting on February 24, 2016, the Board announced that, in the future, films with nudity would \\"receive the most critical consideration\\" and passed only if the nudity was \\"an essential element of a drama the nature of which warrants such presentation.\\" Reception Interior of the promotional brochure \\"Inspiration presents a decided novelty, for it is the first moving picture in which the nude figure of a woman has been used for artistic reasons only,\\" wrote The Morning Telegraph, which reported Munson's credentials as one of the most famous artist's models in the United States. \\"Miss Munson's classic beauty and her remarkable poise absolutely remove every suggestion of the objectionable,\\" wrote the reviewer. \\"George Foster Platt, who directed the picture, has used the utmost delicacy producing the picture, and it would have to be a very prudish person who could find any serious objection to the film. The story is too insignificant to sustain the interest for five reels, but the many beautiful poses of Miss Munson will do more than make up for the lack of a good plot. The picture will attract more than usual interest and the delicate and attractive way that a difficult subject has been filmed will no doubt receive the praise it deserves.\\" Likewise, a reviewer for The Moving Picture World regarded the story as \\"slight and conventional\\", while another credited the film for \\"presenting a conventional but reasonably diverting story. ‚Ä¶ Moreover, it may be noted in favor of Inspiration that it possesses an artistic, and at times, even an educational value. Good taste has been displayed in the handling of scenes that might easily become coarse.\\" Critics praised the third reel of the film, which details the difficult process of molding Munson's body in plaster for the casting of a sculpture. \\"At last true art has stepped into the motion field and it is all due to Audrey Munson, the Panama-Pacific model who has gained much fame about of late owing to her shapely figure,\\" wrote Variety. \\"There is a bit of a story. It is trivial, however. It is about an artist unable to get a satisfactory model. His friends find a country girl who never posed before. She needs the money. She is capable from the minute she starts and immediately wins fame for the sculptor. There is a bit of love mixed in with the model and artist being joined at the altar. After all the posing that girl did that boy took no chance whatever when he married her, for there was nothing hidden from him. It is one nude pose after another. Miss Munson is always the central and bare figure. The picture has an educational trend as well as being artful. This will make some dizzy, but bookers should get busy. It's a cuckoo.\\" Preservation No copies of Inspiration are listed in any film archives,Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Database: Inspriation suggesting that it is a lost film.

Being a prequel to Dark Reign: The Future of War and the expansion pack, Dark Reign 2's storyline focuses on what has come before the conflict in the first Dark Reign. Gameplay Dark Reign 2 features three modes: campaign, online multiplayer and an instant action mode. Multiplayer functionality allows up to 32 players at once, featuring four 'rulesets\\"; Gluttony, Protect HQ, Blood Bath, and Deathmatch. Blood Bath is a mode in which the first team to kill a certain number of units wins. Protect HQ (by far the most used) is a ruleset in which a player who loses their HQ for a certain period of time (about three minutes) loses. Gluttony is a condition where the first player to collect a certain amount of resources wins. Deathmatch is a ruleset in which a player who loses all of their units is defeated. Players are allowed to create custom mods for the game by making simple configuration files and using the packaging software which can be found on the original game CD. The game has a built-in map editor and there are several tutorials available on the internet to create your own terrains. Plot The two opposing factions introduced in Dark Reign 2 are the Jovian Detention Authority a.k.a. JDA (which evolve to be the Imperium faction) and the Sprawlers (which later evolve to be the Freedom Guard faction of Dark Reign). The two sides are caught up in a conflict spanning Earth's 26th (and final) century. In the Intro, a Sprawler Leader who interacts with the player in the Sprawler campaign quotes: The struggle between JDA and the Sprawlers is, at its heart, the struggle between authority and freedom, government and proletariat. As the earth reeled into ecological collapse, the JDA established large dome cities to protect the citizenry from the harsh conditions outside. However, they left behind all those who would not succumb to their dictatorial will: the Sprawlers. The disenfranchised Sprawlers are thus left in the outside world, bathed in the harsh conditions of a dying planet and fueled by the explosive rage of rebels fighting for a free life under the thumb of a cold overlord. Thus, the Sprawlers desperately fight to break into the dome cities, while the JDA desperately sally out into the decaying 'Sprawl' to keep them out and in a state of submission. The player can choose to play either the JDA or the Sprawlers campaigns, both with similarities and differences to the overall story. If the player chooses the JDA, he/she is a member of strike force, guided by the JDA central AI, \\"CYGNET\\". If the player chooses the Sprawlers, he/she is referred to as \\"Sirdar\\", a new member of the council eager to prove him/herself. Both sides are concerned with the massive increase in seismic activity around the world which is consuming it and each other. As the story progresses, both sides gain access to new units and structures which the player will need to use in order to proceed further and develop more powerful strategies. =JDA plot= Activity in the city is going wild with sprawlers making regular skirmishes and setting up anti-air batteries that harass air traffic. The situation in Sector 13 is the worst. After being shot down by one of the batteries, Strike Force's first objective is to rescue a base from destruction, push back Sprawler forces and clearing all the anti-air batteries in the area so that an air strike can be performed on the Sprawler base. Along the way, the first earthquake occurs, almost destroying the base Strike Force rescues. In the next mission, the JDA also discover Togra's shrine has been damaged in the quake. They wish to investigate. Strike Force captures a Voodun priest as a prisoner and force him to take them to the shrine. But along the way, powerful Togran pylons prevent movement up the hill without being destroyed. To deal with this, Strike Force deploys aerial infantry to destroy two Togran power generators in order to disable the pylons and proceed. At the site, they discover a strange mobile artifact, which resembles an ancient slab on a hovering platform. Cygnet indicates the higher up ranks wish to study the artifact and orders Strike Force to evacuate the artficat to a transporter. Shortly after, radio chatter shows the evacuation plans are in effect and there is a state of panic. In one jungle area, a large JDA force is evacuating without authorization and are primarily concerned with themselves. Their plans make them abandon their post at a large powered gate, which is meant to prevent hordes of Sprawlers from entering the zone. Strike Force is sent in to deal with the cowards before they can escape, which is followed by pushing back the Sprawlers and building power generators on the gate, reactivating it. With the JDA's grip on the sector regained, Strike Force is relocated. It is at that time found that there are three Togran artifacts. Strike Force is tasked with retrieving the second artifact hidden in a temple but along the way, encounter heavy resistance with suicidal cultists of unknown origin, as well as Baron Samedi's, traditionally a Sprawler power from the Shrine. Despite this, Strike force is able to locate and evacuate the artifact. Afterward, the challenge is on to find the third. This is achieved by a large offensive in Arctic mountains to capture Booda Shun, the Voodun High Priest, who reveals the location of the third artifact. Hidden in a city sector, Strike Force must find it before the Sprawlers do. The problem is not only pushing back the Sprawlers, but taking punishment from the frequent earthquakes in the zone. Toward the end, the evacuation plan is in the final stages. However, the JDA does not wish for the artifacts to be taken into the hands of the Sprawlers, along with the Sprawlers leaving with them. They try to destroy all three artifacts, but can't for three reasons. First, a large destructive force is required to destroy them. Second, they have to be destroyed at the same time. Finally, destroying the artifacts will bring about the end of the world. During the final stage, as the last JDA citizens are being evacuated, Cygnet requests that Strike Force sacrifice themselves by remaining behind and destroying the artifacts, achieving this by gathering them around a large number of atomic energy plants before detonating them. It ends with the defeat of the Sprawlers, the salvation of the JDA as the Imperium, the destruction of Earth and the loss of Strike Force. This brings the JDA Campaign to a rather sad and abrupt end. This is the canonical ending and sets the background for the prequel of Dark Reign: The Future of War and the expansion pack. =Sprawler plot= The Sprawlers are running low on numbers and have been on the defensive for a long time. The council heavily squabbles on going offensive or staying defensive, noting they can't stay on the defensive forever. A new Sirdar (the player) begins by aiding them in a more important offensive than the skirmishes of recent, hacking a communication centre feeding a city zone JDA propaganda so that the Sprawlers can spread their own message. They are the first to notice that seismic activity on Earth is increasing on a global scale and taking advantage by making a strike on a crippled base, bringing their first victory. During the quake, they discover that the door seal of Togra's shrine, the research lab of the great Togra himself, has opened despite only being openable by Togra. According to legends, the breaking of the seal signals the beginning of a chain of events. The Sirdar must then send forces through icey mountains to rescue the Voodun high priest, Booda Shun, from JDA captivity and take him to the shrine so he can examine the site. After interpreting the site, Booda Shun brings disturbing news. The breaking of the seal indicates that Earth's time is limited and \\"the planet is rolling toward a catastrophic collapse\\", which will bring the end of everything. During the previous mission, JDA forces were snooping around the site, which indicates they may have find something or are making plans. Sirdar is ordered to hack into the nearby Cygnet relay station to see what the JDA have in mind. After infiltrating the station despite heavy resistance before and after, the station is destroyed and the council reviews the information. The plans reveal the JDA are relocating massive numbers of citizens to the central dome. Activity in the area is increasing at phenomenal rates. The purpose is clear. The JDA are preparing to evacuate Earth, leaving the Sprawlers behind. The council is outraged. As one member says, \\"First they ruin the planet and then they leave us to die with it.\\" He declares death to the JDA and asks who is with him. With this, the whole council unites and puts their squabbling behind. But they find that the dome could have been assaulted easily years ago. Because of how much harder the direct way is to penetrate at the current time, they find the only possible way through is along the coast, which passes through two sub-factions, known as the Breks and the Judas. The Sirdar is charged with leading the way. After securing the river and earning the Breks trust, thanks to new aerial and water technologies, they find the JDA have a secret weapons facility not far ahead from intel by their new allies. A prototype mobile bomb sits outside. Sirdar, if careful, is able to make off with three copies of the prototype, though only one is required. Then the sprawlers aid the Judas in taking out JDA forces that are thinning their numbers, gaining their trust. With their forces built, the final missions involve storming the dome and preventing the JDA from being able to evacuate. If successful, the Sprawlers will become the dominant force and the JDA will be either severely crippled or destroyed. Reception Dark Reign 2 underperformed commercially, and journalists Mark Asher and Tom Chick noted that it \\"didn't even hit PC Data's charts\\". Writing for CNET Gamecenter, Asher reported in September 2000 that the game's sales in the United States had reached 9,770 units, which drew revenues of $443,406.

The team was formed under the name of Dianella Serbia in 1978, with the name changed to the current one in the 1990s to reduce the ethnic tension between former Yugoslav clubs, due to the outbreak of the Yugoslav War. In recent times, the club has seen a major influx of players and personnel who were refugees of the Yugoslav War, mainly from the Krajina region in Croatia, and from Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The club has had some success winning the Division 1 title in 1993 sending them into the state's top division for a brief stint. The club has since spent its time in Division 1 coming close to winning the league in 2013 and 2017; they are competing in the State League Division 2 in the 2020 season.  Club Colours, Crest and Song  The club's crest shows a soccer ball with the double headed eagle (the national emblem of Serbia) on a badge with the Serbian national colours of red, blue and white, in the background and serves as a reminder to the clubs ethnic roots. Although the club is extremely welcoming of other cultures it is expected that the players and staff respect the Serbian Heritage of the club. The club's song is called Igrale se Delije.  Rivalries  Dianella White Eagles have a fierce rivalry with Western Knights, due to the ethnic heritage of the club, Dianella being Serbian and Western Knights being Croatian. Western Knights did however have a long stint in the WA Premier league which did not allow for this fixture as the clubs were in different leagues. With Western Knights relegation, the rivalry intensified and deepened with regular fixtures each year. The most memorable encounters were in the 2013 season in which both teams were challenging for the league title.  Home Ground  Dianella's home ground is at Dianella Reserve, a public open space with many sporting facilities throughout. Dianella share their ground with Little Athletics WA who use the ground during the summer months. The local Serbian community also have built their own stand alone clubroom next to the existing clubrooms which used to be shared with the Little Athletics club. In 2017 club sources indicated that during the state elections that the club was promised funding by the local member to upgrade to their floodlights and change rooms. Upgrade to the floodlights was completed in 2019 and the change rooms upgrade will be completed in April 2020.  Playing history  = 2016 season = The 2016 season was a dark one for Dianella which saw them very nearly relegated from State League Division 1. Mauro Marchione who had control of the squad from the season before had lost almost all of the 2015 roster. The new squad consisted of almost exclusively visa players. Before the season opener tensions began to rise when some of the players and manager revolted against the club over a pay dispute. The manager had made promises to the players that the club could not fulfil and this almost saw the first match of the season against Gosnells not go ahead. in the week after almost the whole squad and Mauro had left the first team and Vesko Zmukic was tasked with the job to pick up the pieces with the few players who stayed he also brought in an array of players who he thought would be able to make an impact on what was going to be a long season. Heavy defeats to Ashfield and more critically, rivals Western Knights, set the tone for the season ahead and they were without a win until almost halfway through the season until they faced fellow strugglers, shamrock rovers. the 2‚Äì0 win galvanised the squad and when they faced Gosnells 2 weeks later they lifted themselves out of the relegation playoff spot. Nebojsa Marinkovic of the Perth Glory had been attending training sessions in an advisory role to help manage Vesko Zmukic. The bad results however returned until once again, shamrock visited Dianella Reserve. By this point of the season ex Socceroo Robbie Dunn had been providing Vesko Zmukic with assistance in training and going into the Shamrock fixture spirits had been lifted. Shamrock managed to go into half time with a 2‚Äì0 lead in a hugely important relegation 6 pointer. Dianella came out after the break and managed to score 3 goals to take all 3 points that all but saw them avoid automatic relegation. a draw against Rockingham and a final day win against Bunbury at home saw them into the relegation play-off with Joondalup city of Division 2. The first leg saw Dianella come out 3‚Äì0 victors and all but seal their continued status in Division 1. The tie ended 4‚Äì2 on aggregate. = 2017 season = In 2017, Robbie Dunn came in as full-time first team coach along with Steve Huxtable as his assistant. The squad assembled has thus far proved to be a strong one with a good showing in the 2017 night series indicating that 2017 will be a far more positive year for the club with talk of silverware very much back on the lips of the Dianella faithful. The club have been boosted by the return of striker Angel Andres who had previously been at Cockburn after an earlier stint with the White Eagles. Dianella made a great start in the 2017 FFA Cup Preliminary rounds in WA beating Ashfield, Forrestfield and ECU Joondalup of the NPL to progress to the quarter finals where they were scheduled to face Cockburn in late May. Sensationally after 2‚Äì2 draw with Gosnells on 1 May coach Robbie Dunn had to step away from full first team coach duties due to personal and work reasons leaving Vesko Zmukic in charge in his absence. The week after Robbie's departure the club had a top of the table fixture against Rockingham City of which the White eagles overcame them 2‚Äì0 to send them top of the league after 5 matches played. After only a week absent Robbie Dunn returned and oversaw Dianella's 2‚Äì2 draw with Joondalup City which saw them drop to third place in the table. On 21 May Dianella faced off against NPL opposition Cockburn City for a spot in the WA Cup Semi-finals. the match saw striker Angel Andres returned to his former club and he punished them with a hat trick as Dianella ran out comfortable 3‚Äì0 victors. This Equalled Dianellas best cup run which came in 1998 where they also made the State cup Semi- finals. Next up would be Sorrento in early June with the victor qualifying for the FFA Cup round of 32. Before the Semi-final Dianella would have back to back away trips to Canning City and Fremantle City. After a good start against Canning in which Dianella went 1‚Äì0 up early through a Stepanovski goal things took a turn in the second half with Canning hitting the lead. Andres Salvaged a point for Dianella in the final minute of the game to maintain their unbeaten start to the season. In the next match 2 days before the cup semi- final, it took a final minute goal from Ibrahim Hamad against Fremantle to steal an important win away to Fremantle this time, sending Dianella top of the table once more. With league duties over for the weekend focus turned to the Sorrento cup Semi-final. With several important players under an injury cloud and the departure of Musonda back to his native Zambia it was never going to be an easy task for the White Eagles. Stepanovski was left out as he was unable to recover in time from an injury sustained in the draw to Canning and Andres started from the bench after he was also injured against Fremantle. Captain Radinovic who was hamstrung since the Cockburn fixture, was available to start. After an early goal to Sorrento Dianella took control of the match and dominated possession of the ball and had Sorrento on the back foot for large parts of the game however the injuries to key attacking players may have been a telling factor as Dianella failed to snatch an equaliser giving Sorrento the 1‚Äì0 win. Following the cup semi-final the next Saturday saw the visit of Forrestfield to Dianella Reserve. After what seemed to be cup hangover Dianella were 2‚Äì0 down after 15 minutes but rallied to bang in 4 unanswered goals and win 4‚Äì2 and keep their undefeated run intact and remain at the top of the table. An eerily identical reverse result of Dianella's away trip to Forrestfield in the previous season where they let a 2‚Äì0 lead slip late on to lose 4‚Äì2. The same comeback heroics unfortunately were not present the following weekend at Ashfield. The White Eagles went 2‚Äì0 down and never recovered suffering their first league defeat of the season and in turn losing top spot. The next week Dianella would have the bye. The Following week the Match against UWA would be postponed due to weather conditions. Following the break was a hugely important match against Western Knights. the Yugoslav Derby produced an entertaining 1‚Äì1 draw in which western knights went 1‚Äì0 down and down to 10 men. Dianella looked to have the win secured only to concede late on. Dianella would then go on to suffer their second defeat of the season against South West Phoenix, again conceding late on to drop points. the weekend of 22 July saw Dianella play the catch up game against UWA and ran out 4‚Äì2 victors. looking to build on the 4‚Äì2 win Dianella would then travel to Gosnells seeking to capitalise on poor results from the other front runners, however a scoreless draw would be played out instead. Rockingham would next visit Dianella reserve and the White eagled came out 4‚Äì1 victors. This proved to give the side a boost as they beat Joondalup City the following week, 2‚Äì0, and returned to the top of the table putting the title chances in their own hands with four games remaining. Dianella then had momentum at a pivotal point in the season. Forrestfield, Western Knights and Bunbury were all keeping pace at the top and it would prove to be a tight end to a great season. Canning were next to visit Dianella reserve and after an early goal from Wanjiru the contest was a tight one until half time. The second half would prove to be a different story with Dianella coming out guns blazing. it was 2‚Äì0 10 minutes after the break and it was from here where the floodgates would truly open. Stepanovski was introduced after being sidelined for 3 months with an ankle injury and Dianella would pile on 4 more goals to take out the game 6‚Äì0. The result provided them with a huge boost to their Goal Difference which might prove to be worth an extra point come seasons end. With three games left Dianella were now on top by two points to Forrestfield and 3 points to both Knights and Bunbury, however Dianella had played a game more. Fremantle were next to visit Dianella Reserve. Fremantle had started the better and were 2‚Äì0 up. Dianella forced their way back into it and took a 3‚Äì2 lead in the second half however a hugely controversial decision or lack thereof by the referee allowed Fremantle to equalise and both teams left with a point. Forrestfield away was much the same with hopes of the title slipping away Dianella succumbed to a 4‚Äì3 defeat despite the hat trick efforts of their striker Andres. With the title all but gone the Ashfield game proved of little significance and although Dianella ran out 2‚Äì1 winners, it was a tale of a season that could have been. Dianella one of the highest scoring teams and losing the fewest games, it was the draws against the lower sides that had killed the title dream in the end. = 2018 and 2019 seasons and Relegation = The 2018 season saw the club start off strong with a bolstered squad full of name players around the WA football scene including the signing of South Sudan international Friday Zico. The initial results in the season were promising with Dianella sitting toward the top of the table after the first few rounds of the season. Things began to sour quickly though with a string of heavy defeats and key players moving on to clubs elsewhere in the league and NPL WA. The poor run of results and bad dressing room atmosphere lead to the resignation of coach Robbie Dunn. The rest of the season would prove to be extremely difficult and Dianella would not be able to escape relegation to Division 2. The 2019 season would require a massive rebuild and transformation of the squad. Dianella would find the first half of the 2019 season reasonably comfortable sporting a mid table position. However another mid season collapse would see them go on an abysmal run to finish 2nd last in Division 2 narrowly escaping possible relegation by 2 points. Another rebuild of the squad with a new manager would be required for the 2020 season.

It is situated in the comarca of Axarqu√≠a. As of 2005, it had a population of 1,398 inhabitants. The village sits at 928 meters above sea level. Alfarnatejo, a neighbouring village, is situated about 3.5 kilometers from Alfarnate. Topography The town's name seems to come from the Arabic word Al-farnat, meaning flour mill. In fact, it now appears as a documented reference to Alfarnate in the tenth century as a zone of high production of flour. In the neighboring village of Alfarnatejo, two flour mills that operated with water from the stream can still be seen and give an idea of what this area was like at that time. Alfarnate is usually characterized as a town of Axarquia, but actually it is a part of a border zone between Axarquia and the plain of Antequera. Along with Alfarnatejo, Colmenar and Casabermeja, Alfarnate is part of a sort of transition zone that has been called \\"Eastern Mountains of M√°laga.\\" Administratively it is often included within the Axarquia de Velez region, despite having almost nothing in common with the towns of Axarqu√≠a. Alfarnate currently belongs to the jurisdiction of the city of M√°laga, a city with which it has almost all commercial relationships with as well as most of the transportation. Traditionally, Alfarnate has maintained most road contact with Malaga, Granada and the nearby city of Loja. It also has a history with nearby towns such as Zafarraya (quas-colonized with Alfarnate in the nineteenth century) and Villanueva del Trabuco. Geography Pinewood in Alfarnate It is located in the northern province, is the highest village (the streets are located at 925 meters above sea level) and its end is completely surrounded by mountains belonging to the geological movement of the Subb√©tica. It has formations of dolomites and marls like the Sierra de Camarolos in the southwest, the Sierra del Jobo, whose peaks form the border for the west and northwest end, with the peak of Chamizo at 1,641 meters. The geographic north, also the port of Alazores, borders with the Sierra de Alhama that runs from north to southeast, with the formations of the Tajo de las Palomas (1,302 m), to meet at the Puerto del Sol (1,100 m) in the Sierra de Emmedio that defines the south with peaks like Vilo (1,415 m), Gallo (1,361 m) and Malinfierno Morr√≥n that protect the town from the south (1,077 m). In the midst of these mountains of considerable height, Alfarnate has a beautiful valley of more than 900 meters making it one of the rarest examples of mountain villages in Andalusia. =Hydrography= Its rivers of water, streams of Palancar and Morales, the latter known as the stream of Juan Lorca, come together at the south of the town to form the river Sabar. It also has numerous springs like Barrionuevo, Castillejo and Ejido that nurtures the Villa. History The name is Alfarnate, like its younger brother Alfarnatejo, is a term originally formed from Arabic Al-farnat meaning flour mill. It can also identify with the old adjective \\"alfarnate\\" meaning rascal or scoundrel. Both the term and the current settlement Alfarnate were inhabited since prehistoric times by the first settlers of the region, as is evidenced by the remains found in the terraces of the Palancar and Morales streams, and at the confluence of both, where lies the village, dating back to the Mousterian period. As early as the Neolithic period, flint workshops are documented around the port of Alazores and the first traces of stable settlements would endure until historic times.

Maidstone has both an 18-hole and 9-hole private golf course. History Maidstone Club The Club derives its name from the original name for East Hampton, which was Maidstone, named after Maidstone in England. It was founded as a 7-hole course in 1894 and expanded to eighteen holes in 1899. The Club was the summer retreat of New York City‚Äôs most wealthy and socially connected families. Maidstone is considered to be the most elite, prestigious and difficult to get into of all the clubs in ‚ÄúThe Hamptons‚Äù. Several notable people have inquired about membership over the years and were summarily prevented from joining the Club. In the 1950s, Groucho Marx was able to play as a member guest but was turned down as a potential member. George Plimpton and Diana Ross were also shunned. Ross was married to billionaire Norwegian shipping magnate Arne N√¶ss, Jr., a member at Maidstone, however he resigned when his wife was denied membership. Donald Trump was a temporary member in the early 1980s, but turned down as a permanent member. Willie Dunn laid out the first course in 1894; it was but a rudimentary 7-hole layout. Seth Raynor drew up re-design plans in 1921. Then in 1924 Willie Park, Jr. and his brother Jack designed the Gardiner Peninsula addition. The expansion resulted in the club having two 18-hole courses, but this was reduced to the current 27-hole layout by the hurricane of 1938. The Parks' routing on the 80 acres on Gardiner‚Äôs Peninsula and the remaining 50 acres introduces multiple hazards at various angles, including a marsh, Hook Pond, sand dunes, beach grass, reeds, well-placed bunkers, out of bounds and the ever-present wind. In 2014, Maidstone was ranked #37 in Golf Magazine's \\"Top 100 Courses in the U.S.\\" list, and #67 in their \\"Top 100 Courses in the World\\" list.Top 100 Courses in the U.STop 100 Courses in the World West Course scorecard Facilities The Maidstone Club features a private beach, pool, tennis house, and club house in addition to the golf course.

Muerte a Secuestradores has assassinated political opponents and community organizers, and waged counterinsurgency warfare against guerrilla movements such as the FARC-EP and the M-19. History =Origin= In the late 1970s, the illegal cocaine trade took off and became a major source of profit. Many of the drug barons began purchasing enormous quantities of land, in order to launder their drug money, and to gain social status amongst the traditional Colombian elite. By the late 1980s, the new class of drug traffickers were the largest landholders in Colombia. They used much of this land for grazing cattle, or left it completely idle as a show of wealth. They also raised private armies to fight off guerrillas who were trying to either redistribute their lands to local peasants, kidnap them, or extract the gramaje tax that was commonly levied on landed elites. =ACDEGAM= At the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982, members of the Medell√≠n Cartel, the Colombian military, the U.S.-based corporation Texas Petroleum, the Colombian legislature, small industrialists, and wealthy cattle ranchers came together in a series of meetings in Puerto Boyac√°, and formed a paramilitary organization known as Muerte a Secuestradores (\\"Death to Kidnappers\\", MAS) to defend their economic interests, to fight against the guerrillas, and to provide protection for local elites from kidnappings and extortion.Human Rights Watch, \\"II. History of the Military-Paramilitary Partnership\\", Colombia's Killer Networks The Military - Paramilitary Partnership and the United States, 1996 (accessed: August 23, 2010) By 1983, Colombian internal affairs had registered 240 political killings by MAS death squads, mostly community leaders, elected officials, and farmers.Santina, Peter \\"Army of terror\\", Harvard International Review, Winter 1998/1999, Vol. 21, Issue 1 The following year, the Asociaci√≥n Campesina de Ganaderos y Agricultores del Magdalena Medio (\\"Association of Middle Magdalena Ranchers and Farmers\\", ACDEGAM) was created to handle both the logistics and the public relations of the organization, and to provide a legal front for various paramilitary groups. ACDEGAM worked to promote anti-labor policies, and threatened anyone involved with organizing for labor or peasants' rights. The threats were backed up by the MAS, which would come in and attack or assassinate anyone who was suspected of being a \\"subversive\\". ACDEGAM also built schools whose stated purpose was the creation of a \\"patriotic and anti- Communist\\" educational environment, and built roads, bridges, and health clinics. Paramilitary recruiting, weapons storage, communications, propaganda, and medical services were all run out of ACDEGAM headquarters.Pearce, Jenny (May 1, 1990). 1st. ed. Colombia:Inside the Labyrinth. London: Latin America Bureau. p. 247. By the mid-1980s ACDEGAM and MAS had experienced significant growth. In 1985, the powerful drug traffickers Pablo Escobar, Jorge Luis Ochoa, and Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha began funneling large amounts of cash into the organization to pay for weaponry, equipment and training. Money for social projects was cut off, and was put towards strengthening the MAS. Modern battle rifles such as the Galil, HK G3, FN FAL, and AKM were purchased from the military and INUNDIL and through drug-funded private sales. The organization had computers and ran a communications center that worked in coordination with the state telecommunications office. They had thirty pilots, and an assortment of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. U.S., Israeli, British and Australian military instructors were hired to teach at paramilitary training centers.Democracy Now!, Who Is Israel's Yair Klein and What Was He Doing in Colombia and Sierra Leone? , June 1, 2000. =MORENA= By the end of the 1980s, the MAS had a significant presence in 8 of Colombia's 32 departments‚ÄîAntioquia, Boyac√°, Caquet√°, C√≥rdoba, Cundinamarca, Meta, Putumayo, and Santander. During this period, a stated goal of the groups was to kill members of the Patriotic Union or any political groups that opposed drug trafficking. At the same time, they began to more intensively involve themselves in municipal, regional, and national politics. In August 1989, the Movimiento de Restauraci√≥n Nacional (\\"Movement of National Restoration\\", MORENA) was formed by members of ACDEGAM. Misattributed violence Through an investigation, the Colombian government discovered that by 1983, several dozen murders attributed to MAS were done so mistakenly. Instead, these 59 murders were committed by on-duty agents of the government, including police officers and military personnel.

They are the domesticated form of the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) and are related to other game birds such as the pheasants, turkeys and partridges. Although the timing of their domestication is unknown, there is evidence that domestic guineafowl were present in Greece by the 5th century BC. They lay 25‚Äì30 eggs in a deep, tapering nest. Their eggs are small, dark and extremely thick-shelled. The hens have a habit of hiding their nests, and sharing it with other hens until large numbers of eggs have accumulated. The incubation period is 26‚Äì28 days, and the chicks are called \\"keets\\". As keets, they are highly susceptible to dampness (they are indigenous to the more arid regions of Africa) and can die from following the mother through dewy grass. After their first two to six weeks of growth, though, they can be some of the hardiest domestic land fowl. Sexing the birds is not as simple as telling a rooster from a hen chicken. When they are adults, the helmet and wattles of the male are larger than those of the female (Guinea-hen), and only the female makes the two-note cry imitated as \\"Buck-wheat!\\" or \\"Pot-rack!\\" while the male only has a one-note cry. Aside from that, though, the two sexes are mostly identical in appearance. As domestics, guineafowl are valuable pest controllers, eating many insects. They are especially beneficial in controlling the Lyme disease- carrying deer tick, as well as wasp nests. While they are rarely kept in large numbers, a few are sometimes kept with other fowl to be used as a security system against birds of prey. They will call with their loud, high shrieking voices if concerned about intruders. They are highly social birds and tend to languish when alone. Within the domesticated species, many color variations have been bred forth aside from the \\"pearl\\" or natural color of the helmeted guinea. These include white, purple, slate, chocolate, lavender, coral blue, bronze, pewter, buff dundotte, blonde, and various pieds. It can be cooked using any recipe that calls for chicken, but is considered to be more flavorful and, because of its higher cost, is generally served at special occasions. It is particularly common in French and Italian recipes. {  A three-day-old keet  An adolescent lavender guineafowl  Domestic guineafowl in India  A cooked guinea hen } References * Madge and McGowan, Pheasants, Partridges and Grouse *J.S.

Its mission is to improve health outcomes by facilitating the unification of data on human genetic variation and its impact on human health. Inception The HVP concept was conceived by Richard Cotton, a leader in the field of human genetic variation. His group, the Genomic Disorders Research Centre, based at the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital, has established a consortium that covers genomic variation and its health implications in a comprehensive form. This consortium has encouraged the creation and supported many of the 571 gene specific variation databases currently available on the internet. However, these databases are of varying completeness and individualistic, so the Human Variome Project was born to establish a central project to encourage the collection and sourcing of this data, verifying it and ultimately using it for improved health outcomes. Geneticists, Diagnosticians, Researchers and Bio-informatics scientists came together in June 2006 at the Human Variome Project Meeting, organized by Professor Cotton‚Äôs team, and agreed take on the task of organising data collection and unifying the systems of data access and storage. This initiative builds on substantial pilot work and achievements of the Human Genome Variation Society. The authority of those initiating this project is evidenced by the fact that major international bodies were present. These included WHO, OECD, European Commission, UNESCO, March of Dimes (US), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US), Google, representatives of two dozen international genetics bodies, numerous genetics journals, 20 countries and Australian State and Federal Governments. This major international project, a natural partner to the Human Genome Project, will require substantial funding to get it to a sustainable position. A five-year secure budget period of approximately US$12m per year has been proposed to initiate the project. This will enable the project to be organized and find operational funds for the tasks of system development, informatics, database curation and clinical access as well as collection systems that are open and accessible to all. The Human Variome Project seeks to provide open access to the full realm of genetic variation for the benefit of everyone. The Centre for Arab Genomic Studies (CAGS) has initiated efforts to proceed with the Arab Human Variome Project under the Human Variome Project. CAGS was one of the participants of the HVP meeting in Melbourne. Since then, several meetings have been held between officials of HVP and CAGS members to discuss the nature of work involved.

The game features 256-colour VGA graphics and background music in MOD format. Alien Carnage is composed of four episodes. The first episode was released as shareware, and the rest were distributed commercially. In May 2007, John Passfield and 3D Realms released Alien Carnage as freeware. In 2014, the game was re-released with Windows support. Plot The cartoon-style game features agent Halloween Harry, who has to save the world from aliens that want to take control of Earth by turning its population into green-skinned zombies. Some of the enemies reference Aliens, Gremlins, and Elvis Presley. Harry is helped by controller Diane, who gives him information via a video link. Gameplay Alien Carnage screenshot In the game, the player has to shoot zombies and aliens with his flamethrower and other weapons, rescuing hostages along the way. Instead of jumping, Harry uses a jetpack to reach higher platforms. His jetpack shares ammo with his flamethrower, which means it is best for the player to use both sparingly. Harry can eat and drink junk food to gain health (rescuing hostages also restores Harry to full health), and upgrade to different kinds of ammo by using ammo dispensers. The player needs to collect coins dropped by killed enemies to buy this ammo. They can also pick up other power-ups with various effects, including a wrapped gift (additional ammo for Harry's current weapon), a money bag (30 additional credits; coins dropped by enemies are worth 5 credits each), and a 1-up icon (an extra life, plus full health). The game progress can be saved through the use of computer terminals scattered across the levels. To advance to the next level, Harry needs to rescue all the hostages, then use the elevator. Development 200px Alien Carnage was originally titled Halloween Harry, and was released under this title for its first two versions. After v1.2, Apogee suggested to the developers that the title should be changed because it might be viewed as a seasonal Halloween- themed game, limiting sales during the rest of the year. They renamed it to Alien Carnage, and it was re-released as \\"Alien Carnage v1.0\\" in 1994. Along with the name change, missions one and three were switched, and with Apogee's shareware model, this meant that half of the game could be played for free. Halloween Harry was originally written and released commercially in 1985 by John Passfield as a game for the Australian Microbee computer system. Legacy In 1996 a sequel called Zombie Wars was released. This game takes place three years after the original story. The aliens return to Earth to try to enslave its population. Harry and Diane, who has been promoted to field agent and is now also a playable character, have to save the world again. A number of other friendly characters have been added as NPCs. Gee-Whiz Entertainment (formerly Interactive Binary Illusions) made plans for an animated cartoon based on the third, future Alien Carnage game. The cartoon was to include Harry and Diane, the NPCs, as well as probably recurring alien and zombie characters. The script was roughly based on the script for Zombie Wars, but both the game and the cartoon were never made.

It is a small gadfly petrel. The species is native to the North Pacific Ocean. Its secretive habits, remote breeding colonies and limited range have resulted in few studies and many aspects of the species' biology are poorly known. Description and taxonomy The Bonin petrel is a small gadfly petrel, 30 cm long with a wingspan of around 67 cm. It has a white head with a black cap and face markings; overall the head often has a scaled appearance. Its pale grey upperparts have darker primaries and wing coverts creating an \\"M\\" mark across the back. The underwing is white with dark edging and a patch at the carpal joint and across underwing coverts. The tail is dark grey, and the rest of the plumage is white, except for a dark half collar on the breast. Like the rest of the Pterodroma petrels the black bill is short and hooked. The legs and feet are pink with dark patches. The Bonin petrel is currently thought to be closely related to the mottled petrel and white-necked petrel in the subgenus Proaestrelata, based on a review of the whole genus Pterodroma looking at morphology, calls, breeding biology, diet and parasitic lice.Imber, M.J., (1985) \\"Origins, phylogeny and taxonomy of the gadfly petrels Pterodroma spp.\\" Ibis 127: 197-229 Despite the species having two remote and separate breeding localities the species is monotypic and no subspecies are recognised. Distribution and population 995,000 individuals, about 99% of the total population, breed on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, while 5,000 individuals (1% of the population) breed off the coast of Japan on the Ogasawara and Volcano Islands. Behaviour =Diet= The Bonin petrel and the closely related mottled petrel are the only Pterodroma petrels with a fish dominated diet. Principal prey items are fish from the family Myctophidae (lantern fish) and Sternoptychidae (hatchetfish). Squid from the family Ommastrephidae are also consumed.Harrison, C. S., T. S. Hida, M. P. Seki. (1983). \\"Hawaiian seabird feeding ecology\\". Wildl. Monogr. 85: 171. All of these prey are midwater residents that use photophores and migrate to the surface during the night to feed; thus it is assumed that Bonin petrels are nocturnal feeders that seize prey at the surface while resting on the sea or in flight. Bonin petrel eyes contain high levels of the pigment rhodopsin which aids nocturnal vision. The Bonin petrel is usually solitary at sea, but is occasionally seen in large multi-species flocks. Like all procellariids the Bonin petrel has a modified area of the gut known as a proventriculus which partly digests prey to create stomach oil, an energy rich oil which is lighter to carry than prey. =Breeding= A Bonin petrel trapped in the sand on Midway Atoll by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, before being rescued. The Bonin petrel breeds in dense colonies, on islands in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands; French Frigate Shoals, Laysan, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Reef, Midway Atoll and Kure Atoll; and on the Volcano Islands and Bonin Islands south of Japan. Colonies are only visited by birds at night, with birds usually arriving soon after sunset. Nesting occurs in the winter in order to avoid competition for burrows with other nesting procellariids. In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands the nesting season sometimes overlaps with the larger wedge-tailed shearwater, which will evict and even kill Bonin petrel chicks in order to use the nesting burrows. Both parents participate in digging burrows, which are usually dug in sand or hard coral substrate, and are between 1 and 3 m long. Pairs are territorial, and will defend an area of around 2 m around the burrow entrance. They also display philopatry, returning to the same burrow in consecutive years, redigging the burrow if it has collapsed. Burrows in harder coral substrate are less likely to collapse than those dug into sand. Bonin petrel chick The species is thought to mate for life (like other Procellariiformes); pairs undertake mating flights consisting of pairs chasing and calling at each other over the colony prior to laying. A single egg is laid by a pair each breeding season, if it is lost then no attempt is made to re-lay. Laying occurs in late January. Both parents incubate the egg, with incubation stints of eight days for the male and six days for the female. Hatching occurs after around 50 days, around mid-March. The chicks are semi-altricial at hatching, covered in light grey down, and are brooded by the adults for two days after hatching, after which both parents feed at sea and return at night to feed the chick. Chicks are fed stomach oil and small items of prey. Chicks fledge around 80 days after hatching, in early June. =Migration= After the breeding season both chicks and adults migrate northwards to the seas off Honsh≈´ and Sanriku in Japan. The timing of the migration is partly influenced by sea surface temperatures. Birds begin to disperse south and east again in August and begin to return to their breeding islands in September. During the breeding season birds feed in the waters surrounding breeding islands. The species has not been recorded in the east Pacific. Relationship with humans Prior to the arrival of humans the Bonin petrel nested on the main Hawaiian Islands, fossil remains have been found on Kauai, Oahu and Molokai. These bones have been found in association with human archaeology, strongly implying that they were a food source for Polynesian settlers, along with other seabirds. The species was extirpated from the main islands prior to the arrival of Europeans. The species is currently threatened by introduced species, particularly rats. Polynesian rats and black rats have devastated populations of Bonin petrels in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, primarily by taking eggs. Polynesian rats introduced to Kure Atoll were such a problem for Bonin petrels that for a five-year period in the 1960s not a single chick fledged (hatching success can be as high as 90% in the absence of introduced predators). Similar devastation occurred on Midway, where black rats introduced in 1943 (the same black rats that caused the extinction of the Laysan rail) reduced the population of Bonin petrels from 500,000 birds to 32,000 by 1995.Seto, N. W. H., and D. O‚ÄôDaniel. 1999. Bonin Petrel (Pterodroma hypoleuca). In The Birds of North America, No. 385 (A. Poole and F. Gill, eds.). The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA. Rabbits introduced to Lisianski Island destroyed nesting habitat and undermined nesting burrows. Habitat destruction limits breeding success on some islands, especially as it increases competition with more aggressive species like the wedge-tailed shearwater. Conservation measures are in place to protect the Bonin petrel and other seabirds that share the species' breeding islands. Island restoration projects are restoring native vegetation on Laysan and Midway, and rats and rabbits have been removed from all the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The species is currently classified as least concern by the IUCN.

Variations of the name, due to transliteration, include: Boustani as well as Boustany, Bistany, Bostany, Bustani, Besteni, and Bestene ( / ALA-LC: BustƒÅnƒ´). The name, a nisba, derives from the Arabic word for garden (a loanword from Middle Persian ‚Äúb≈çyestƒÅn‚Äù) and is thought to date back to at least the 15th Century. The family has its roots in a place named El-Bassatin, in the village of Jableh, near Lattakia, Syria. In the beginning of the 16th century, and after the Ottoman conquest of the Middle East, Muqim (Abu Mahfouz) left his home town and went towards Mount-Lebanon, stopping at Dahr Safra, then Bqerqacha, a village at the foot of the Cedars of Lebanon. Muqim had three sons, Mahfouz, Abd el Aziz and Nader. Abd el Aziz resided in Deir el Kamar. Nader and his family settled in the Chouf region, principally Deir el Kamar and Debbiy√©. Muqim and his eldest son Mahfouz went back to the northern regions of the country. His descendants still bear the name Mahfouz. Following social and political upheavals, the Boustanis settled in every single region of Lebanon ‚Äì in Giyeh, Marj, Jounieh, Tripoli, in the Koura and the Beqaa ‚Äì as well as in Syria (Damascus and Aleppo) Turkey and Egypt. Throughout the two last centuries, and especially in the beginning of the 20th, the great migration of the Boustanis towards Europe and the New World began. During the two last centuries, members of the family emigrated from different Lebanese cities to numerous countries around the world. However, the Boustanis who presently live in Lebanon, as well as those of the Diaspora, constitute one sole family. The Boustanis were a family of many talents, to which were born eminent archbishops, great statesmen, businessmen, writers and poets in Lebanon and in the Diaspora countries. Among the bishops were: Abdallah (1780‚Äì1866), Boutros (1819‚Äì1899) and Augustin (1875‚Äì1957).

Malone (August, 1844 ‚Äì January 1, 1905) was a professional baseball player in the 1860s and 1870s. He was the catcher for Athletic of Philadelphia in 1871, champion of the first professional league season. Born 1842 in Ireland, Malone was one of 4 Irish natives to play in the first National Association season and one of five in the first National League season. If we do not count the NA as a major league, he and Andy Leonard share distinction as the first major leaguers born in Ireland, by good fortune that their teams met in the first NL game, 22 April 1876. Leonard is alone first if we count the NA. Although a left-handed thrower, Malone was mainly a catcher with major teams, both amateur and pro. Physically it was a demanding position, no one using a face mask or regularly using a glove. (Doug Allison used buckskin mittens in 1870, but gloves and masks were only adopted for regular use by some catchers beginning in the late 1870s.) Malone was the primary catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics 1871‚Äì72, Philadelphia White Stockings 1873, and Chicago White Stockings 1874. In 1873‚Äì74, he was team captain, earning manager's credit today. He returned to the Philadelphia Whites and played in eight games in 1875, then returned to the Philadelphia Athletics for the inaugural National League season, catching 20 of 60 games. Malone was the highest paid player in professional baseball in 1874 with an annual salary of $2,800 (). Fergy Malone was 34 when the Athletics were expelled from the National League, which contracted from eight to six for 1877. He returned to the majors with the one-year Union Association in 1884, managing its Philadelphia entry and playing in one game. In 220 major league games Fergy Malone batted .274 with one home run, 160 runs batted in, and 200 runs scored. He was a player-manager for his teams in 1873, 1874, and 1884, recording a total of 47 wins and 66 losses. Malone died 1905 in Seattle, Washington at the age of 60. He is buried at New Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia. The Society for American Baseball Research list Malone as a Civil War veteran, having enlisted in a 100 days‚Äô regiment on July 15, 1864, and serving with Dick McBride as a private and corporal in Company A, 196th Pennsylvania.

Cobb with Sawyer Glacier in the background. Tracy Arm is a fjord in Alaska near Juneau (outlet at 57¬∞ 46' 40\\" N 133¬∞ 37' 0\\" W). It is named after the Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Franklin Tracy. It is located about south of Juneau and north of Petersburg, Alaska, off of Holkham Bay and adjacent to Stephens Passage within the Tongass National Forest. Tracy Arm is the heart of the Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness, designated by the United States Congress in 1990 Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness contains and consists of two deep and narrow fjords: Tracy Arm and Endicott Arm. Both fjords are over long and one-fifth of their area is covered in ice. During the summer, the fjords have considerable floating ice ranging from hand-sized to pieces as large as a three-story building. During the most recent glaciated period, both fjords were filled with active glaciers. Access The most common access is by boat using Stephens Passage and entering Holkham Bay and Tracy and Endicott Arms. Float planes from Juneau and Petersburg are also used as a means of access. Large tour vessels and smaller commercial cruise boats frequently use Tracy Arm as a tour destination or as a stop along their normal tour routes. Sawyer Glacier The twin Sawyer Glaciers, North Sawyer and South Sawyer, are located at the end of Tracy Arm. The wildlife in the area includes black and brown bears, deer, wolves, harbor seals, and a variety of birds, such as Arctic terns and pigeon guillemots. The mountain goats, which are usually found in the higher elevation areas, have been seen near the base of Sawyer Glacier. Deepwater Emergence A rockfish hides in a red tree coral (Primnoa pacifica). The deep passageways and thin continental shelf leads to unique connections between offshore and inshore waters. The colder water temperature, nutrient-rich upwelling, and strong currents allow for many species that live in deeper water to survive in the shallower waters. The corals in this area, such as Primnoa pacifica, have contributed to the location being labeled as Habitat Areas of Particular Concern. P. pacifica is typically a deep water coral normally found between and ; however, in the Tracy Arm it is found between and , offering a unique opportunity for research.

Banks' Florilegium is a collection of copperplate engravings of plants collected by Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander while they accompanied Captain James Cook on his voyage around the world between 1768 and 1771. They collected plants in Madeira, Brazil, Tierra del Fuego, the Society Islands, New Zealand, Australia and Java. During this voyage, Banks and Solander collected nearly 30,000 dried specimens, eventually leading to the description of 110 new genera and 1300 new species, which increased the known flora of the world by 25 per cent. Banks' and Solander's specimens were studied aboard the Endeavour by the botanical illustrator Sydney Parkinson. He made 674 detailed drawings of each specimen with notes on their colour, and completed 269 watercolour illustrations before dying of dysentery after the Endeavour left Batavia. When they returned to London in 1771, Banks employed five artists to create watercolours of all of Parkinson's drawings, and 18 engravers to create 743 copperplate line engravings from the completed watercolours at a considerable cost. The engraving work stalled in 1784, and the Florilegium was not printed in Banks' lifetime. On his death in 1820 he bequeathed the plates to the British Museum. Some of the plates were eventually printed. Between 1900 and 1905, James Britten and the British Museum issued prints of 315 of the plant engravings in black ink, under the title Illustrations of Australian Plants. Others were included in black and white in the 1973 book Captain Cook's Florilegium. The first complete full- colour edition of the Florilegium was published between 1980 and 1990 in 34 parts by Alecto Historical Editions and the British Museum (Natural History). Only 100 sets were made available for sale, some on a subscription basis. The plates were printed using a 17th-century technique known as √† la poup√©e where each colour was applied directly to the plate; colour accuracy was checked against Parkinson's notes and through consultation with the Museum's Botanical Editor, Chris Humphries. Each plate took from one week to two months to proof. Chris Humphries worked closely with his colleague, the Botany Librarian Judith Diment, as well as the printers led by Edward Egerton-Williams, the typesetters led by Ian Mortimer and colleagues at Alecto Historical Editions including Nigel Frith, Laurence Hoffman and Elaine Shaughnessy. Parts 1 to 15 consist of 337 plates relating to the Australian flora, parts 16 to 34 include Brazil, Madeira, New Zealand, Java, Society Islands and Tierra del Fuego. Banks‚Äô Florilegium is the world‚Äôs largest 20th-century fine art printing project and has been exhibited all over the world. A selection of 147 of the plates was printed at three-quarter scale by Thames and Hudson in 2018 as Joseph Banks' Florilegium, with commentaries by botanist David Mabberley and essays by art historian Mel Gooding. A documentary recounting the journey and the publication of the Florilegium, Banks' Florilegium: The Flowering of the Pacific, was released in 1984. It was narrated by Australian Robert Hughes. A book on the subject, The flowering of the Pacific: Being an account of Joseph Banks' travels in the South Seas and the story of his Florilegium, by Brian Adams was published by the British Museum in 1986.

Background In 1927 the Chinese Communists revolted against Kuomintang following a purge of its members in Shanghai by National Revolutionary Army commander Chiang Kai-shek, which marked the end of the KMT's four-year alliance with Soviet Union and its cooperation with the CCP during the Northern Expedition to defeat warlords and unify China.Wilbur, C. Martin (1983), The nationalist revolution in China, 1923‚Äì1928, Cambridge University Press. P.114 In 1931 the Japanese launched its invasion and subsequent occupation of Manchuria. Chiang Kai-shek, who led the central government of China, decided that China must avoid all-out war with Japan due to domestic turmoil and inadequate preparation. Therefore, he \\"pursued a strategy of appeasing Japan while struggling for real national unity and over time sufficient strength to confront the Imperial army. This appeasement policy lasted for another six years\\".Taylor, Jay (2009). The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press P.94 Even though his campaigns against the Communists resulted in their retreat and a 90% reduction in their fighting strength, he was unable to eliminate their forces entirely, and his policy of \\"internal pacification before external resistance\\" (:) was very unpopular with the Chinese populace, which caused widespread resentment against the ruling KMT leadership and its regional warlord allies. Xi'an Incident In 1936, Chiang Kai-shek assigned the \\"young marshal\\" Zhang Xueliang the duty of suppressing the Red Army of the CCP. Battles with the Red Army resulted in great casualties for Zhang's forces, but Chiang Kai-shek did not provide any support to his troops. On 12 December 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CCP. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT was forced to agree to a temporary end to the Chinese Civil War and the forming of a united front between the CCP and KMT against Japan on 24 December 1936.Ye, Zhaoyan Ye, Berry, Michael. (2003). Nanjing 1937: A Love Story. Columbia University Press. . The China Democratic League, an umbrella organization for three political parties and three political pressure groups, also agreed to take part in the united front formed by KMT and the CCP. Cooperation during the War of Resistance In July 1937, the Presidium of the Central Military Commission issued an order for the Red Army to reorganize into the National Revolutionary Army and stand by for the anti-Japanese front line. As a result of the truce between KMT and CCP, the Red Army was reorganized into the New Fourth Army and the 8th Route Army, which were placed under the command of the National Revolutionary Army. The CCP agreed to accept the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, and began to receive some financial support from the central government run by KMT. In agreement with KMT Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region were created. They were controlled by the CCP. After the commencement of full- scale war between China and Japan, the Communists forces fought in alliance with the KMT forces during the Battle of Taiyuan, and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the Battle of Wuhan. However, the Communists submission to the chain of command of the National Revolutionary Army was in name only. The Communists acted independently and hardly ever engaged the Japanese in conventional battles but proved efficient in guerrilla warfare. The level of actual coordination between the CCP and KMT during the Second Sino-Japanese War was minimal.Buss, Claude Albert. (1972). Stanford Alumni Association. The People's Republic of China and Richard Nixon. United States. Breakdown and aftermath In the midst of the Second United Front, the Communists and the Kuomintang were still vying for territorial advantage in \\"Free China\\" (i.e. those areas not occupied by the Japanese or ruled by puppet governments). The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938 as a result of the Communists' efforts to aggressively expand their military strength through absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind enemy lines. For Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance, the CCP would call them \\"collaborators\\" and then attack to eliminate their forces. For example, the Red Army led by He Long attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in Hebei in June, 1939.Ray Huang, ÂæûÂ§ßÊ≠∑Âè≤ÁöÑËßíÂ∫¶ËÆÄËî£‰ªãÁü≥Êó•Ë®ò (Reading Chiang Kai-shek's Diary from a Macro History Perspective) China Times Publishing Company, 1994-1-31 , p.259 In December 1940, Chiang Kai-shek demanded that the CCP's New Fourth Army evacuate Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces. Despite the intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders committed insubordination by marching in an unauthorized direction and also missed the deadline to evacuate, added to this were the attacks of the Communist Party to the Kuomintang Forces in Hebei in August 1939 and in Jiangsu in October 1940, so they were ambushed and defeated by Nationalist troops in January 1941. This clash, which would be known as the New Fourth Army Incident, weakened but didn't end the CCP position in Central China and effectively ended any substantive co-operation between the Nationalists and the Communists and both sides concentrated on jockeying for position in the inevitable Civil War.Schoppa, R. Keith. (2000). The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History. Columbia University Press. . It also ended the Second United Front formed earlier to fight the Japanese. Afterwards, within the Japanese occupied provinces and behind enemy lines the KMT and CCP forces carried on warfare with each other, with the Communists eventually destroying or absorbing the KMT partisan forces or driving them into the puppet forces of the Japanese. The communists under the leadership of Mao Zedong also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, land and tax reform measures favoring poor peasants; while the KMT allocated many divisions of its regular army to carry out military blockade of the CCP areas in an attempt to neutralize the spread of Communist influence until the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chiang Kai Shek and Mao Zedong attempted to engage in peace talks. This effort failed and by 1946 the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party were engaged in all-out civil war. The Communists were able to obtain seized Japanese weapons and took the opportunity to engage the already weakened KMT. In October 1949, Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China, while Chiang Kai-Shek retreated to the island of Taiwan.

The trunkline connects US Highway 127 (US 127) south of Lansing and US 23 north of Ann Arbor. The highway connects several smaller communities in the rural areas along its route. M-36 also runs concurrently with two other roadways, sharing pavement with M-52 and County Road D-19. According to traffic surveys in 2010, between 650 and 15,300 vehicles used the highway on average each day. The current highway to bear the M-36 moniker is the second to do so. The first was signposted in 1919 north of Pontiac until it was partially replaced by the modern M-24 in 1926. The M-36 designation was moved to the current roadway in 1930. It has been changed a few times since the highway was completely paved in 1940. The last change created the M-52 concurrency in 1969. Route description M-36 starts at an interchange with US 127 northwest of Mason. The highway follows Cedar Street southeast and southerly from exit 66 through commercial and residential areas to Ash Street near downtown. M-36 turns eastward along Ash Street through downtown. Outside of the city, Ash Street becomes Dansville Road north of Mason Jewett Field, the local airport. The highway continues eastward through mixed fields and woodland. The trunkline follows Mason Street through the village of Dansville. Just south of White Oak Township Park in White Oak Township, M-36 turns south to run concurrently along M-52 through Millville. At Topping Road, M-36 turns east again north of Lowe Lake. Crossing into Livingston County where it becomes Plainfield Road, the highway then passes the Plainfield Cemetery through community of the same name and turns southeasterly toward Gregory. M-36 in Hamburg, facing east North of town, M-36 turns south on Gregory Road. The highway continues as Main Street in the community to Carr Street; the highway turns back eastward on Carr Street in Gregory. As the highway runs easterly, it skirts the northern edge of the Pinckney State Recreation Area and the southern edge of the Timber Trace Golf Club. As Main Street in Pinckney, M-36 passes through the center of town. At Howell Street, County Road D-19 merges in from the south. The two designations run concurrently along Main Street to Pearl Street, where D-19 turns northward. At the intersection with Dexter Street, M-36 intersects the western terminus of D-32, the \\"Highway to Hell\\". East of Pinckney, M-36 passes between Rush and Bass lakes in the Pettysville area. Immediately east of there, the highway passes through woods between Oneida and Zukey lakes in Lakeland. The trunkline passes to the south of Buck Lake and then meanders through Hamburg southeasterly. M-36 ends as 9 Mile Road at exit 54 on US 23 in Whitmore Lake. M-36 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-36 were the 15,226 vehicles daily in Mason; the lowest count was 657 vehicles per day east of the M-52 concurrency. No section of M-36 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History =Original designation= On July 1, 1919, M-36 was routed along what is now M-24 between Pontiac and Burnside. In November 1926, this highway was redesignated as part of M-24 between Pontiac and Lapeer.

Philanthropist of the year 2004  The AstroPower Case  Barnett was involved in a financial fraud case along with Thomas Stiner, while he was the CEO of AstroPower Inc. The SEC filed a settled civil fraud action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Allen Barnett, the former CEO, and Thomas Stiner, the former CFO, of AstroPower Inc. According to the complaint, they had made material misstatements, engaged in fraudulent accounting practices, and signed filings made with the Commission that they either knew or were reckless in not knowing, contained substantially fabricated and false financial statements. The SEC charges that at the direction of Barnett and Stiner, AstroPower improperly recognized about $4 million in revenues from four transactions executed over the course of the second and third quarters of 2002. As a result of improperly recognizing revenue from these transactions, AstroPower‚Äôs net income was overstated by about $160,000 or 80 percent for the second quarter of 2002, and about $440,000 or 113 percent for the third quarter of that year, according to the SEC. Barnett and Stiner agreed to permanent injunctions. Along with other sanctions, they agreed to the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $65,000 and $40,000, respectively.

The population was 48,103 as of the 2005 Mexican census. One of the most interesting aspects of this town is the discovery of an early Mesoamerican skeleton commonly referred to as \\"Tepexpan man\\". Recent research tries to show that the skeleton was not that of a man but that of a woman. The woman was apparently trampled by a raging mastodon around 11,000 BCE. The proposition that Tepexpan Man was a woman has been advanced by one Mexican archaeologist based on DNA analysis. His peers at INAH have not accepted his conclusions and he has not submitted his analysis in a paper for peer review. Thus, until peer review confirms his work one must leave the matter as conjecture.

In zoology, automimicry, Browerian mimicry, or intraspecific mimicry, is a form of mimicry in which the same species of animal is imitated. There are two different forms. In one form, first described by Lincoln Brower in 1967, weakly-defended members of a species with warning coloration are parasitic on more strongly-defended members of their species, mimicking them to provide the negative reinforcement learning required for warning signals to function. The mechanism, analogous to Batesian mimicry, is found in insects such as the monarch butterfly. In another form, first noted by Edward B. Poulton in 1890, a less vulnerable part of an animal's body resembles a more vulnerable part, for example with deceptive eyespots or a false head that deflects attacks away from the real head, providing an immediate selective advantage. The mechanism is found in both vertebrates such as fishes and snakes, and insects such as hairstreak butterflies. Automimicry has sometimes been put to military use. The A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthog) was often painted with a false canopy on its underside, imitating itself, while the armoured recovery vehicle variant of the Churchill tank had a dummy gun, imitating an armed variant of the same tank. Mimicry of distasteful members of the same species Automimicry was first reported by the ecologist Lincoln Brower and colleagues, who found that monarch butterflies reared on cabbage were palatable to blue jays. However, monarchs raised on their natural host plant, milkweed, were noxious to jays - in fact, jays that ingested them vomited. Subsequently, Brower proposed the hypothesis of automimicry involving a polymorphism or spectrum of palatability: some individuals might be defended, and others palatable. It turns out that many species of insects are toxic or distasteful when they have fed on plants that contain chemicals of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some milkweed butterflies feed on milkweeds (Asclepias) which contain the cardiac glycoside oleandrin; this makes them poisonous to most predators. These insects are often aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that has sampled a toxic specimen even once is unlikely to risk tasting harmless specimens with the same aposematic coloration. Such acquired toxicity is not limited to insects: many groups of animals have since been shown to obtain toxic compounds through their diets, making automimicry potentially widespread. Even if toxic compounds are produced by metabolic processes with an animal, there may still be variability in the amount that animals invest in them, so scope for automimicry remains even when dietary plasticity is not involved. Whatever the mechanism, palatability may vary with age, sex, or how recently they used their supply of toxin. wagtail eating a moth, tend to avoid, or to taste and spit out, toxic insects, then mimicry of distasteful forms by harmless morphs of the same species should be favoured. The existence of automimicry in the form of non- toxic mimics of toxic members of the same species (analogous to Batesian mimicry) poses two challenges to evolutionary theory: how can automimicry be maintained, and how can it evolve? For the first question, as long as prey of the species are, on average, unprofitable for predators to attack, automimicry can persist. If this condition is not met, then the population of the species rapidly crashes. The second question is more difficult, and can also be rephrased as being about the mechanisms that keep warning signals honest. If signals were not honest, they would not be evolutionarily stable. If costs of using toxins for defence affects members of a species, then cheats might always have higher fitness than honest signallers defended by costly toxins. A variety of hypotheses have been put forth to explain signal honesty in aposematic species. First, toxins may not be costly. There is evidence that in some cases there is no cost, and that toxic compounds may actually be beneficial for purposes other than defence. If so, then automimics may simply be unlucky enough not to have gathered enough toxins from their environment. A second hypothesis for signal honesty is that there may be frequency-dependent advantages to automimicry. If predators switch between host plants that provide toxins and plants that do not, depending on the abundance of larvae on each type, then automimicry of toxic larvae by non-toxic larvae may be maintained in a balanced polymorphism. A third hypothesis is that automimics are more likely to die or to be injured by a predator's attack. If predators carefully sample their prey and spit out any that taste bad before doing significant damage (\\"go-slow\\" behaviour), then honest signallers would have an advantage over automimics that cheat. False head Many blue butterflies (Lycaenidae) such as this gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus) have a false head at the rear, held upwards at rest, deflecting attacks from the actual head. Many insects have filamentous \\"tails\\" at the ends of their wings and patterns of markings on the wings themselves. These combine to create a \\"false head\\". This misdirects predators such as birds and jumping spiders (Salticidae). Spectacular examples occur in the hairstreak butterflies; when perching on a twig or flower, they commonly do so upside down and shift their rear wings repeatedly, causing antenna-like movements of the \\"tails\\" on their wings. Studies of rear-wing damage support the hypothesis that this strategy is effective in deflecting attacks from the insect's head. Natural selection in favour of features that deflect predators' attacks is straightforward to explain: variants of patterns that more effectively deflect attack are favoured, since animals with ineffective variants are likely to be killed. Naturalists since Edward B. Poulton in his 1890 book The Colours of Animals have noted that butterflies with eyespots or other false head markings can be expected to escape with minor wing damage while the predator gets only \\"a mouthful of hindwing\\" instead of an insect meal. In Poulton's words: Pygmy owl (Glaucidium californicum) showing eyespots behind head A 1981 experiment confirmed the expected correlation between deceptiveness and survival in butterflies. Among vertebrates, snakes such as the rubber boa and the coral snake coil up and hide their head, instead displaying their tail as a false head. Some fishes such as the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots near their tails, and when mildly alarmed swim slowly backwards, presenting the tail as a head; however, various hypotheses for the function of such eyespots have been proposed. Several species of pygmy owl bear false eyes (ocelli) on the back of the head, misleading predators into reacting as though they were the subject of an aggressive stare. Military usage Automimicry has sometimes been used in military vehicles and aircraft. Among vehicles, specialised variants such as the British Second World War Churchill armoured recovery vehicle had no room for an actual gun, but was fitted with a dummy weapon, imitating the armed version of the same tank, to give it some protection. The ground attack A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthog) was sometimes painted with a camouflage scheme that included both disruptive coloration and automimicry in the form of a false canopy on the underside. This was intended to confuse the enemy about the aircraft's attitude and likely direction of travel.

He was head coach at Texas A&M; University from 1972 to 1978 and at Mississippi State University from 1979 until 1985. Bellard died on February 10, 2011 after battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) since the fall of 2010. Bellard is a member of the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. He was considered to have had one of the most innovative offensive minds in football and is credited for inventing the wishbone formation. Early life A native of Luling, Texas, Bellard was one of 12 children. His father was a geologist and driller who arrived in Central Texas in the late 1920s to take part in the emerging oil boom. Bellard graduated from Aransas Pass High School and went on to attend the University of Texas at Austin, where he played his freshman year under coach Dana X. Bible. Bellard broke his leg during his sophomore season and later transferred to Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University). Coaching career =High school= Bellard was a high school head coach for 21 seasons, where he achieved a record of 177‚Äì59‚Äì9 and won three state titles. During his time as a high school coach, he explored the idea of running an offense out of a three-back formation. Bellard began coaching at Ingleside High School, a Class B school in Ingleside, Texas. He guided the school to two consecutive regional wins (as far as Class B football went) in 1953 and 1954, and a street near Ingleside High School is named after him.http://hipcodes.com/78362/Coach_Emory_Ballard He was then hired to succeed Joe Kerbel at Breckenridge High School, then a state powerhouse in the second-highest UIL classification. Under coach Kerbel and his predecessor Cooper Robbins, Breckenridge won three 3A state championships in 1951, 1952, and 1954. Bellard continued that winning tradition with state titles in 1958 and 1959. In 1960, Bellard was selected over Gordon Wood to replace Bob Harrell as head coach at Central High School in San Angelo, Texas. San Angelo Central was playing in the highly competitive District 2-4A, nicknamed the \\"Little Southwest Conference\\", against perennial state champions such as Abilene and Odessa Permian. Bellard amassed a 59‚Äì19‚Äì2 record at San Angelo Central, winning a 4A state championship in 1966. He then left the high school ranks for the University of Texas at Austin. In 1988, Bellard returned to the high school level, coaching Spring Westfield High School near Houston, Texas, to a 41‚Äì22‚Äì5 record over six seasons. =College= Texas In 1967, Bellard was hired as the linebackers coach at the University of Texas at Austin and was moved to offensive coordinator in 1968. At this time, he developed and implemented the wishbone formation, a system inspired by the variations of the veer developed by Homer Rice and run by Bill Yeoman at the University of Houston. Texas A&M; Bellard became head coach at Texas A&M; in 1972, taking over head-coaching duties from Gene Stallings. In his seven years at Texas A&M;, he finished with a record of 48‚Äì27 and three top-15 finishes. Acting as his own offensive coordinator, Bellard hired former high school football coaches to assist him as backfield coaches, including Gil Bartosh (1973) and Chuck Moser (1974‚Äì1978). Both Bartosh and Moser had won Texas state championships. In 1975, however, Bellard hired Tom Wilson away from Jim Carlen's Texas Tech coaching staff to serve as the Aggies' offensive coordinator. For the defensive department, Bellard hired Melvin Robertson, one of the top defensive coaches, away from Bill Yeoman's coaching staff at the University of Houston. Robertson became defensive coordinator, and among his assistants were R. C. Slocum and Dan LaGrasta. Bellard's first two seasons at Texas A&M; were difficult, as his Aggies finished 3‚Äì8 and 5‚Äì6, respectively. In 1974, with a pair of his own recruiting classes suited to run the wishbone formation, the Aggies went 8‚Äì3, then followed it up with two 10‚Äì2 seasons, including a pair of wins over Royal and the Longhorns and three consecutive bowl games. After starting the 1978 season 4‚Äì0, Bellard resigned mid-season after two consecutive losses: 33‚Äì0 to Houston and 24‚Äì6 to Baylor. Mississippi State After A&M;, Bellard spent seven seasons as head coach at Mississippi State University. His best years as the Bulldogs head coach were in 1980 and 1981, when his team finished 9‚Äì3 and 8‚Äì4, respectively. Also, Bellard was the coach when Mississippi State defeated number 1, undefeated Alabama 6-3 in Jackson, Mississippi in 1980. However, the Bulldogs significantly regressed after 1981. In the next five seasons, he only won a total of five games in SEC play. Before the 1985 season, Bellard boldly predicted that the Bulldogs would rebound and win their first SEC title since 1941. They not only failed to do so, but went winless in SEC play. Bellard was fired after the season.

It premiered on August 6, 2006 and aired on Thai Channel 3. Much like each Super Sentai and Power Rangers series has an overall theme (mythology, dinosaurs, magic, etc.), Sport Rangers theme is sports, which each of the Sport Rangers has a specialty in. The second season of the show, titled Sport Ranger 2 (Thai: ‡∏Ç‡∏ö‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏™‡∏õ‡∏≠‡∏£‡πå‡∏ï‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏£‡πå 2), premiered on Channel 3 on February 5, 2012. Plot Starhunter is an alien tribe that steals all life energy on other planets, gathering the energy in the sixth dimension using \\"King Medal\\" and bringing it under their control. Soon they created \\"Knight Medal\\" when \\"King Medal\\" was not able to absorb all the energy. Hoping to conquer the Earth in one fell swoop, since they believed it would not offer much resistance, they brought along both medals. Fortunately, the ship carrying both medals got hit by crossfire in a war that was going on down on Earth. The medals were lost as the ship exploded in Siberia. Starhunter was forced to retreat and create new medals. One of the medals was broken into 5 pieces. The broken medal was taken by researchers headed by Dr. Earth, and the complete medal was taken by Dr. Heart. One day, Heart's research lab exploded and the medal was nowhere to be found. Later Dr. Earth realized that monsters that had begun to appear were humans that had absorbed the energy from the missing medal when the lab exploded. Upon further research, Dr. Earth created \\"SportDetector\\" to control the 5 broken pieces and special suits to utilize each piece's unique power. He gave five youngsters the suits to stop these monsters. Meanwhile, Starhunter is preparing their new invasion of Earth. At the end of the first season's finale, the three male Sport Rangers (Ace, Up, and New) sacrifice themselves to destroy the evil's palace.

Stennis (CVN 74) and USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) conducting dual aircraft carrier strike group operations and showing presence in the Indo-Asia-Pacific. A show of force is a military operation intended to warn (such as a warning shot) or to intimidate an opponent by showcasing a capability or will to act if one is provoked. Shows of force may also be executed by police forces and other armed, non-military groups. Function Many strike missions by aircraft over insurgency areas involve the use of flare drops and low-level passes only and are intended to intimidate suspected enemy forces rather than to be immediately used for attacks. Shows of force have historically been undertaken mostly by a military actor unwilling to engage in all-out hostilities, but fearing to 'lose face' (to appear weak). By performing a carefully calculated provocation, the opponent is to be shown that violent confrontation remains an option, and there will be no backing off on the principle that the show of force is to defend. Shows of force may be actual military operations, but in times of official peace, they may also be limited to military exercises. Shows of force also work on a smaller scale: military forces on a tactical level using mock attacks to deter potential opponents, especially when a real attack on suspected (but unconfirmed) enemies might harm civilians. As an example, most air \\"attacks\\" during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have been simple shows of force with jet aircraft dropping flares only while making loud, low-level passes. One recent 12-month report for Afghanistan noted 18,019 strike sorties by US military aircraft, with weapons use for only 3,330 of the missions. Notable examples * Operation Paul Bunyan, a dawn- period military raid by US and UNC forces into the Korean Demilitarized Zone, a reaction to the unprovoked slaying of two US Army officers by North Korean troops following the infamous \\"Axe Murder Incident.\\" * Operation Poomalai, on 4 June 1987, the Indian Air Force mounted a mercy mission to airdrop humanitarian relief supplies over the besieged town of Jaffna in Sri Lanka during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The mission was undertaken as a symbolic act of support for the Tamil Tigers two days after a previous unarmed effort which was mounted in the form of a small naval flotilla and was thwarted by the Sri Lankan Navy. * Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, was the effect of a series of missile tests conducted by the People's Republic of China in the waters surrounding Taiwan including the Taiwan Strait from 21 July 1995 to 23 March 1996. The first set of missiles fired in mid to late 1995 were allegedly intended to send a strong signal to the Republic of China government under Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as moving ROC foreign policy away from the One- China policy. The second set of missiles were fired in early 1996, allegedly intending to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate in the run-up to the 1996 presidential election. * Operation Restore Democracy in Gambia to remove the former president Yahya Jammeh.

With four chapters, and more than a dozen affiliates, it is one of the largest and oldest lighthouse organizations in the world. History Founded in 1984 by Wayne Wheeler and initially headquartered in San Francisco, California, one of the United States Lighthouse Society's first major projects was the purchase of the lightship LV605 in 1986 from a private individual. The organization subsequently invested $400,000 and more than 40,000 volunteer hours in the preservation and restoration of the vessel. In 2003 the society received the California Governor's Historic Preservation Award for its work on the ship. The society relocated from California to Hansville, Washington in 2008, siting its headquarters at the historic Point No Point Lighthouse, which it rented from Kitsap County (the county, in turn, leased the lighthouse from the U.S. Coast Guard, before ultimately purchasing it in 2012). Since 2008, the United States Lighthouse Society has been headquartered in the historic \\"Keeper's House\\" on the grounds of the Point No Point Light (shown here) in Hansville, Washington. In 2009 the U.S. Lighthouse Society was recognized as a \\"Preserve America Steward,\\" one of the first 11 cultural and historic organizations designated to receive the Bureau of Land Management-sponsored award in recognition of \\"a successful use of volunteer time and commitment.\\" The society launched a partnership with clothing brand Lands' End in 2014. Under the terms of the deal, Lands' End made a donation of $30,000 to support restoration of the Block Island Southeast Lighthouse in Block Island, Rhode Island. Activities =Preservation= The society actively raises money and organizes volunteers to preserve and restore four historic lighthouses: the Point No Point Lighthouse in Washington state, Hooper Island Lighthouse in Maryland, Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse in Maryland, and Lightship LV605, currently moored in Oakland, California. =Publications= The society publishes a quarterly print magazine, The Keepers' Log, about the history of lighthouses in the United States. A second quarterly publication, Lighthouse Bulletin, chronicles society activities and is distributed in PDF format via email. =Travel= The United States Lighthouse Society organizes several one-to-two-week tours of historic lighthouses during the spring and early autumn for members and non-members. In 2014 tours were scheduled in eastern Michigan, Massachusetts, Maine, the Outer Banks, Long Island, and along the St. Lawrence River.

It is also called Strawbreaker. Eyespot is more severe where wheat is grown continuously and when the weather is cool and moist. Treating crops against eyespot with fungicide costs millions to farmers and is complicated by the pathogen becoming resistant to the more commonly used fungicides. Severe cases of the disease can reduce yield by up to 40%. It is most common in temperate regions such as North and South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Africa.Hollmann, M. (n.d.). Eyespot of Wheat, Retrieved October 27, 2007, from Symptoms The eye-shaped elliptical lesions which give eyespot its name form on lower stem bases near to the soil surface. The lesions are straw yellow, often with black pupil-like dots in the centre, and are bordered by greenish-brown to dark-brown rings. In cases of severe infection stems are weakened at the point of infection which makes the host susceptible to lodging. This symptom is associated with the W-type (Oculimacula yallundae). Alternatively in other cases of severe infection the nutrient and water supply to the plant is disturbed, resulting in low quality grain and whitehead production due to early maturation. This is associated with the R-type (Oculimacula acuformis) Prescott, J.M., Burnett, P.A., Saari, E.E., Ranson, J., Bowman, J., Milliano, W., Singh, R.P., & Bekele, B. (n.d.). Wheat Disease and Pests: a guide for field identification. Retrieved November 2, 2007, from Development of infection It is more severe if wheat is grown continuously in same field over the same period. The fungus grows as mycelium which penetrates successive leaf sheaths throughout the growing season. High humidity, cool, and damp weather at the soil surface favours disease development. Whilst dry and hot weather causes the leaf sheaths of the plant to dry and fall off, taking the inoculum with it, thus lessening disease. Invasion of fungi Invasion of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides'\\" in wheat initiates with release of enzyme for breaking the plant cell wall. A specific sequence of enzymes is employed; without these enzymes the fungus would not be able to invade the plant cell. The process begins with breaking of the leaf cuticle by formation of appressoria which provide the mechanical force to break into the cell. Then Pectin, cellulase, hemicellulase and protease enzymes are released to enable invasion into the host cell. Now the fungus is present in the plant stem, it causes disease by affecting nutrient and water supply to upper parts of the plant, weakening the plant stem. In some cases beta, 1-3 glycan synthase is also released to penetrate the callose matrix.Vidhyasekaran, P. (n.d.). Fungal Pathogenesis in Plant and Crop: Molecular Biology and Host Defence Mechanisms. Retrieved November 3, 2007, from Plant defences Once the fungus penetrates the wheat cell wall, the fungal cell wall materials (i.e. chitin) act as elicitors which interact with plant receptors and induce the plant defence mechanism. One product of this is reinforcement of the cell wall in an attempt to stop the invasion. The plant starts forming the papillae - a callose matrix (cellulose, suberin, protein, gums, calcium and silicon) which provides extra resistance to penetration, however this barrier does remain effective for long if the level of micro-organisms present is high. Wheat cells also release hydroxyproline glycoprotein (HRGP) in their cell walls. Secretion of HRGP is dependent on the signal induced by the fungal elicitors stimulating the transcription of genes encoding HRGP accumulation in the cell wall. In the case of wheat HRGP is less accumulated allowing for more easy invasion by the fungus. Wheat also releases silicon when it is attacked by the fungus. This acts as a regulator of the plant defence mechanism. It can interfere with cationic co-factor of enzymes which influences pathogenesis related events. As a further defence mechanism wheat releases WGA which contains lectins and has a toxic effect on metabolism of fungi.Mishkind, M., Raikhel, N. V., Palvitz, B. A., Keegstra, k.

She has bright cinnamon wing bars and buff supercilia. Young birds are similar to the female, but have paler plumage and weaker wing bars. It has a dry pzeek call, and the male's song consists of high whistled notes ending with a buzz, chee shee shee shee paah. Habitat This is an uncommon bird at the edges and clearings of mountain forests, and in scrubby second growth, bamboo clumps, and bushy pastures from 1500 m altitude to the timberline. In the wet season it can descend to 1200 m altitude. Its numbers have reported to be high when the bamboo is flowering on favoured sites such as Cerro de la Muerte. Behaviour The finch is seen singly, in pairs, family groups or in mixed- species feeding flocks with other small birds such as warblers. =Breeding= The nest, built by the female, is a cup of plant material into which she lays typically four eggs. The female alone incubates for 12‚Äì14 days to hatching. =Feeding= It feeds on insects and spiders, grass and bamboo seeds. It will also squeeze nectar from flowers and juice from berries.

The former residence of businesswoman, socialite, philanthropist and collector Marjorie Merriweather Post, Hillwood is known for its large decorative arts collection that focuses heavily on the House of Romanov, including Faberg√© eggs. Other highlights are 18th and 19th century French art and one of the country's finest orchid collections. History As she arranged her divorce from her third husband, Joseph E. Davies, Post initiated a search for a new house. She wanted a stately home with fifteen- foot ceilings, sited on a large, thickly wooded spot. After the divorce was final, she bought Arbremont, a Georgian Colonial estate in northwest Washington on the edge of Rock Creek Park, rechristening it Hillwood, a name she had also used for her former property in Brookville, Long Island. Arbremont, with its 36 rooms, had been built in the 1920s by Mrs. Delos A. Blodgett for her daughter, Helen Blodgett Erwin. After Post acquired it from the Erwins, she hired the architect Alexander McIlvaine to gut and rebuild its interior. The renovations, which included moving the library doors to frame a view of the Washington Monument, were completed in 1956. Showcasing her collections including French, Asian and what Hillwood is most known for ‚Äì Russian art and religious objects. A view of the Lunar Lawn and Mansion During her marriage with Davies, who served as the second Ambassador to the Soviet Union in the mid-1930s, she acquired a vast collection of objects from the pre-Bolshevik Russia, including a chandelier from the Catherine Palace that hung in her breakfast nook, and Faberg√© art works including the Twelve Monograms Easter egg. Post had her first guests to the house in May 1957 and hosted her first big party there on July 7, 1957. Hillwood quickly gained a reputation as one of Washington's \\"most extraordinary estates.\\" As a tribute to Post after her 70th birthday, 181 of her friends built \\"Friendship Walk,\\" a path from Hillwood's rose garden to a crest overlooking Rock Creek Park. Concerned with Hillwood's fate after her death, Post arranged in 1962 to bequeath the estate, along with a $10 million endowment to maintain it, to the Smithsonian Institution so that it might be maintained as a museum. She made the bequest of Hillwood (as well as most of her other properties) contingent upon its being maintained and used according to her wishes (which included the condition that the estate not be used for dining), and she established the Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation of the District of Columbia to ensure compliance: any property improperly used would revert to the Foundation. Post was residing at Hillwood when she died on September 12, 1973. The Smithsonian declined to make the changes needed to convert Hillwood to a museum, and complained that by 1975 the endowment, producing $450,000 annual income, was insufficient to maintain the site. Accordingly, Hillwood and the majority of the collection was returned to the Post Foundation by April 1976. Hillwood is now maintained by the Post Foundation as the Hillwood Museum and Gardens, showcasing 18th and 19th century French art and art treasures from Imperial Russia. Collections Hillwood features over 17,000 objects from the original collection and selected objects collected after Post's death. Collection highlights include: The Duchess of Parma and Her Daughter by Jean- March Nattier * Portrait of Catherine the Great, a full-length portrait of Catherine II in her Russian elite finery. * Two Chests of Drawers designed by Jean-Henri Riesener, official cabinetmaker of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. * The Duchess of Parma and Her Daughter by Jean-Marc Nattier. * The Countess Samoilova and Her Foster Daughter by Karl Briullov, 1834. * A Boyar Wedding Feast by Konstantin Makovsky, 1883. * Imperial Easter Eggs, two House of Faberg√© that were gifts to Maria Fedorovna from her son Nicholas II of Russia. * Bleu Celeste Wares, from Manufacture nationale de S√®vres including a tureen from 1754. * Mrs. Post Portrait by Douglas Chandor, 1952. * Felonion, Russian Orthodox liturgical vestment worn by a priest during the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896. Additional highlights include tapestries from the 1730s, table services collected by Catherine the Great, Russian Orthodox Church objects such as icons and liturgical vessels, rare lace tablecloths, Wedgwood ceramics, bloodstone objects and jewelry by Harry Winston and Cartier.\\"Hillwood Estate, Museum and Gardens Tour,\\" 2010 Hillwood offers appointment-only access to their Art Research Library, which features a notable selection of Russian and European decorative art books and documents. Gardens and grounds In 1926, landscape architect Willard Gebhart designed Arbormont, creating a landscape molded around the twenty-five acres later owned by Post. When renovating Hillwood, Post incorporated many of the garden designs into her interior design. Creating the 'garden rooms' which feature touches unique to the Lunar Lawn and Rose Garden. Post's breakfast nook even includes an inside garden of orchids, bringing the outside in. =Motor Court= The first area of arrival for guests, who were escorted into the house by her butler. The elliptical shape of the area allowed for an easy stream of cars in and out of the property. Azaleas, dogwoods, and camellias surround the area. The center of the court features a statue of a young Eros surrounded by English ivy and boxwoods. Eros holds a goat and pulls an arrow from his quiver, representing fertility and love. The Motor Court was designed by Innocenti and Webel. =French Parterre= A view of the mansion from the French Parterre Following the tradition of parterre gardens, the Hillwood parterre is a formal garden with low detailed plantings that are divided with footpaths and walls of English ivy. Again designed by Innocenti and Webel, the garden was split into four areas using channels of moving water, gravel footpaths and a central pool that is lined with Italian glass tile. A terra- cotta sculpture of Diana overlooks the garden. She is accompanied by marble sphinxes, a cherub riding sea animals in the central pool, as well as outdoor furniture from Post's collection. This garden serves as a Post's tribute to 18th-century French aristocracy. =Rose Garden= In 1956 Post hired Perry Hunt Wheeler, who designed the White House rose garden, to update the rose garden to her current tastes. Each bed is planted with a single variety of floribunda rose which bloom in the summer. A wood and brick pergola travels through the rose garden with climbing roses and white wisteria, which is finished with boxwood. tulips and sweet alyssum also decorate the garden. The rose garden also serves as the location of Post's ashes, which are placed in the base of a pink granite monument that is topped with an antique urn made of deep purple porphyry. The monument features her coat of arms and the inscription, in Latin, that translates as \\"All my hopes rest in me.\\" =Friendship Walk= A simple English inspired garden walk was a gift to Post from her friends in 1957. Lined with boxwood, rhododendrons and azaleas. =Four Seasons Overlook= An additional gift from her friends in 1957, four statues representing the seasons stand in a circular overlook surrounded by trees such as magnolia, dogwood, cherry, and crape myrtle. Each statue base has a plaque with the names of friends who contributed the gift gardens. The center stone of the walkway features an inscription from a postcard by Tsarina Alexandra Feoderovna stating \\"Friendship outstays the hurrying flight of years and aye abides through laughter and through tears.\\" =Putting Green= A putting green, frequently used by Post, consists of closely cut bentgrass which is surrounded by Japanese holly. Magnolias and viburnum surround the area as well. The putting green =Lunar Lawn= Named after its crescent shaped design, the Lunar Lawn served as the scene of parties and special events during warm weather months at Hillwood. Events were hosted for the likes of the Boy Scouts of America and the National Symphony Orchestra. The Washington Monument is visible from the lawn, which is framed by American elms. Evergreen, false cypress, azaleas, camellias, dogwoods and magnolia are also found in the Lunar Lawn. Every season the horticulture staff rotates out flowers, a tradition set by Post. Tulips in the spring, annuals in the summer, chrysanthemums in the fall and pansies in the winter are planted. A large statue of a lion, dating from early 18th century England, rests towards the house. 1960s blue and white lawn furniture is placed on the lawn during warm weather months adding a modern twist to an often historical seeming outdoor environment. A gold gilt swan fountain is placed on one wall, and satyrs stand near the terrace. =Japanese-Style garden= Japanese-Style Garden The entrance to the Japanese garden features stone guard dogs and a tall granite lantern. A stream cascades along the hillside and pools appear as well, with stones placed in them to provide safe crossing. A figurine of Hotei, a small sculpture of a tortoise and small T≈çr≈çs are found throughout. Designed by landscape architect Shogo Myaida, the garden combines native and Japanese plants including Japanese pines, Colorado blue spruce, maples, azaleas, and false cypress. =Pet cemetery= Post lived with numerous pet dogs throughout her lifetime and chose to memorialize them on the Hillwood grounds. Dogtooth violets, sweetbox and groundcover surround limestone memorials of poodles, hounds and spaniels. The last burial that took place in the cemetery was in 1972, Post's schnauzer Scampi. =Dacha= Amongst the gardens and woods is a dacha built in 1969, representational of pre-Cold War Russian culture. Surrounded by rhododendrons and azaleas, the building features whole-log architecture and detail carvings around the windows and door. The building houses changing exhibitions. =Cutting garden and greenhouse= The cutting gardens serve as the Hillwood's main source for fresh flowers, as per Post's desire to have fresh flower arrangements throughout the house and grounds year round. The selection of flowers dates back to the 1950s, while the greenhouse was rebuilt in 1996 and looks as it did when Post was alive. The greenhouse serves as horticulture staff offices, work spaces, and home to Hillwoods famous collection of orchids. =Adirondack Building= Representative of Post's retreat, Camp Topridge in the Adirondack Mountains, the building, which was built ten years after Post's death, serves as a museum programming venue. Outreach The Hillwood established an advisory committee in 2001 for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community of Washington, D.C. The estate hosts events such as \\"Gay Day,\\" gay friendly concerts and film nights. Working closely with major events such as Gay Pride and numerous non-profit queer organizations in the region, the Hillwood serves as one of the few cultural institutions reaching out to the LGBT community. In 2007 the estate was awarded the Ally of the Year Award by the D.C. LGBT Chamber of Commerce. Hillwood Caf√© A contemporary cafe with European-inspired fare is located on the grounds, open for lunch and Sunday afternoon tea. The restaurant also provides free picnic blankets for dining on the garden grounds.

Situated on a border between The Ozarks and the Arkansas Delta, the park preserves the remains of the abandoned frontier town of Davidsonville. The town was one of Arkansaw Territory's first settlements when founded in 1815, serving as an important river port town on the Black River. The former townsite was made into a state park in 1957 and a monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History =Davidsonville= There is evidence that the site was occupied by French colonists prior to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Archeologists have discovered evidence of Native American use of the site as early as 4,000 BC. The 1822 courthouse was apparently built on top of an Indian mound which was built before 1,100 AD. Headstones in the Phillip-Reeve Cemetery, 2011. Davidsonville was founded in 1815 and rapidly became the most important town in northeast Arkansaw Territory, but was abandoned by the 1830s. The community served as a river port town on the west bank of the Black River, near the confluence of the Spring River and Eleven Point River with the Black River. The town was on important stop on the Southwest Trail and featured several important frontier establishments. In 1817 the first post office of Arkansas Territory opened in the town, followed in 1820 by the first federal land office of the territory. In 1822, the first courthouse of Arkansas Territory was built in Davidsonville. The town became the county seat of Lawrence County, which at the time comprised roughly the northern third of Arkansas. Shortly after the town's founding the Southwest Trail was rerouted onto higher ground, bypassing Davidsonville. New towns appeared along the trail's new route, diminishing Davidsonville's importance. In 1828 the land office was moved to Batesville, about southwest. In 1829 the county seat and courthouse began a series of moves to a number of other towns. Today there are very few remains above ground. The townsite, which had been a grid of streets with a central square where the courthouse stood, now looks like a grassy field with a few trees. Only upon closer inspection does one begin to see hints of the former town. The park's interpretive signs point out where certain buildings used to stand. There are two small cemeteries. By the time of Arkansas statehood in 1836, Davidsonville was essentially abandoned. =Park history= Monument marking the old town site of Davidsonville, 2011 Old Davidsonville State Park was created in 1957. The park offers interpretive programs, camping, hiking, fishing, and canoeing. Park facilities were originally built on the old townsite. The site was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as \\"Old Davidsonville State Historic Monument\\", also known as Lawrence-Davidsonville. During the 1980s the townsite was cleared in order to facilitate archeological studies. The park facilities are now located on nearby ridges. The first careful archeological study was conducted in 1972, and several others followed. Recreation Although one of Arkansas's historic state parks, there are opportunities for recreation at Davidsonville Historic State Park also. Fishing is available on the Black River, Eleven Point River, Spring River, and a small fishing pond within the park. An interpretive guide is available for tours of the original platted site year round. Picnic tables, screened pavilions, playgrounds, and a visitor's center with gift shop. Campers can utilize the 30 campsites (twelve class AAA, eight class A, ten tent).

It is named after Ralph Lloyd (1875-1953), a California rancher, oilman, and real estate developer who moved to and started the development of the area. The Lloyd District is bounded by the Willamette River on the west, NE Broadway on the north, NE 18th Ave. on the east, and Interstate 84 on the south. Adjacent neighborhoods are Eliot and Irvington to the north, Sullivan's Gulch (with which it slightly overlaps) on the east, Kerns on the south, and Old Town Chinatown (via the Steel and Broadway bridges over the Willamette) to the west. The area west of Interstate 5 is called the Rose Quarter, home of the Moda Center (originally Rose Garden Arena) and Memorial Coliseum. Prior to urban renewal in the 1950s, this area was an African American residential community, including many who had lost their homes in the Vanport flood of 1948.http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=0004CBF8-16F2-1ECD-A42A80B05272006C Most of the district lies east of I-5, where the Oregon Convention Center and Lloyd Center Mall are the principal landmarks. The area includes restaurants, shops, hotels, movie theatres, condominiums and apartments, and office buildings (the largest being the Lloyd Center Tower, standing at 20 floors and 290 feet). The neighborhood is accessible using public transportation. TriMet buses and MAX trains provide frequent service in the district, as well as a commuter express bus route form Vancouver via C-Tran. It is served by all four lines of the MAX light rail system. Four Blue Line and Red Line stations (Rose Quarter Transit Center, Convention Center, Northeast 7th Ave, and Lloyd Center/Northeast 11th Ave) and one Yellow Line station (Interstate/Rose Quarter) are within the district. The Portland Streetcar system began serving the district in 2012, with the opening of a new east-side line, originally called the Central Loop; this was renamed the Loop Service in 2015. From 2001 to 2012, TriMet's Fareless Square covered a narrow portion of the Lloyd District, making bus and MAX service free in the designated area (which included all four MAX stations within the district). However, free rides on buses were discontinued in January 2010, the fareless area being renamed the \\"Free Rail Zone\\", and even the free light rail service was discontinued effective September 1, 2012.  Redevelopment  The Lloyd District viewed from the northwest. Several high-rise apartment complexes are under construction along the Holladay Street corridor. The first development is the 657-apartment, Hassalo on Eighth, composed of three buildings on a superblock, and including over 1,000 bike parking spaces. It topped out in February 2015, and was completed in October 2015. Oregon Square, a 1,030-apartment development by American Assets Trust, is under consideration for across Holladay on the site of several low-rise office buildings. A public plaza would be constructed in the center of the block. Further East, 980 apartments are proposed for the site of the Regal Lloyd Center 10 movie theater. A 174-room Red Lion hotel, built in 1962 as the Cosmopolitan Motor Hotel, was purchased for $12.5 million in 2013 by Grand Ventures Hotel. After a $15 million renovation from 2013‚Äì2015, it reopened as the upscale Hotel Eastlund.

The name Muktasana (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡§®, Liberated Pose) is sometimes given to the same pose, sometimes to an easier variant. Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words siddha (‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß) meaning both \\"perfect\\" and \\"adept\\", and asana (‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®) meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The name Muktasana comes from ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ mukta meaning \\"liberation\\". Ann Swanson writes that the pose is called accomplished as it was the goal of all other asanas to ready the body to sit in meditation in this way. In Light on Yoga, B. K. S. Iyengar quotes several scriptures, stating that the yogin who contemplates Atman and practises Siddhasana for 12 years obtains the yoga siddhis, supernatural powers; and that once the pose is mastered, samadhi follows \\"without effort\\". Siddhasana is one of the oldest asanas, being described as a meditation seat in the 10th century Goraksha Sataka 1.10-12. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika praises the asana, implying it is the only one that practitioners would need, asking \\"When siddhasana is mastered, of what use are the various other postures?\\" Description From a seated position, one heel is brought to press on the perineum with the sole of the foot flat against the inner thigh. The body sits on top of this heel. Adjustments are made until the body is comfortable and the pressure is firmly applied. Then the opposite ankle is placed over the first, so the ankle bones are touching and the heels are above one another with the top heel pressing the pubis directly above the genitals. The genitals will then lie in between the two heels. The toes and outer edge of the top foot are pushed down into the space between the calf and thigh muscles. The toes of the bottom foot are pulled up into the similar space on the opposite side. The spine is held erect. A small meditation cushion or zafu is sometimes used to help align the back vertically. The same pose for women is sometimes called Siddha Yoni Asana. Variations Muktasana, Liberation Pose, is either exactly the same as Siddhasana, as stated in the 15th century Hatha Yoga Pradipika, or a variant with the feet close in to the perineum but resting on the ground. This variant is sometimes called Ardha Siddhasana (Sanskrit ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß ardha, half). Sukhasana, Easy Pose, has the legs crossed at mid-calf. The pose can be supported by sitting on a cushion.

It opened as a 190-bed facility on August 28, 2006. The hospital is operated by the state of Nevada.  Controversy  On April 22, 2013, San Francisco's, City Attorney Dennis Herrera, said that he opened an investigation into recent newspaper reports that a Nevada mental hospital was illegally busing hundreds of newly discharged psychiatric patients to California and other states. A Sacramento Bee investigative series documented what it described as rampant \\"patient dumping.\\" A former patient from the hospital, who was a hospitalized there three times between 2012 and 2014, said that it was common practice. During his stay, he saw patients discharged before recovery was reached if they would agree to go to another state. The patient said he observed this many times and that patients were discharged early were sent to other states, including Maine, California, Florida and Colorado. He said that during his time there, all patients were encouraged to reach out to family members in other states if they wanted to speed up their discharge. The Bee published a series of articles that revealed that the facility has, since 2008, discharged some 1,500 patients, some of them still mentally ill and indigent, with one-way Greyhound bus tickets to out-of-state destinations without adequate provisions for food, medication, housing, or medical treatment, a practice derisively termed Greyhound therapy. The report found that a third of the patients were sent to neighboring California, the bulk of them arriving in Los Angeles and 36 in San Francisco. Further investigation by Cynthia Hubert and Phillip Reese of the Sacramento Bee revealed that patients had been bused as far away as New York City, Chicago, Miami, and Boston. In February 2014, the Sacramento Bee journalists Cynthia Hubert and Phillip Reese received George Polk Awards for their coverage of the scandal, and were finalists for a Pulitzer Prize. On April 29, 2013, officials identified nine employees involved in the improper discharge of patients. Two of them were terminated, three were disciplined, and four others were no longer with the hospital. On January 9, 2014, federal officials warned Rawson- Neal and gave Nevada officials 90 days to correct federal EMTALA standards deficiencies or risk losing its CMS certification and federal funding. At an inspection, conducted on March 12, 2014, the state facility was found to be largely compliant with regulations and will continue to be reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. On August 7, 2019, The Nevada Current News released an investigative report about several mental health care professionals and psychologists claiming to be bullied by their boss, Dr. Shera Bradley. The anonymous employees quoted in the report claim to have left employment at the Rawson-Neal Hospital because of the alleged abuse. The lone source of record, Dr. Ben Adams, was dismissed from the hospital following his claims of abuse. All complaints of bullying made to the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health were investigated and found to be without merit. Witnesses Adams identified in his complaints were interviewed by the Current. They say they have not been contacted by either the Division of Public and Behavioral Health or the Board of Psychological Examiners. The article went on to state, \\"Mental Health America has ranked Nevada last in the nation for mental health access and treatment three years running. Nevada ranks almost last ‚Äî 48th in the nation, for the number of psychologists per capita, with 13.5 per 100,000 residents.

The thrust earthquake's epicenter was in Casiguran, Quezon (now part of Aurora province). A small non- destructive tsunami was generated and at least 207 people were killed. The majority of the deaths occurred in the collapse of a six-story building in Manila. Damage In Manila, many structures that suffered severe damage had been built near the mouth of the Pasig River on huge alluvial deposits. A number of buildings were damaged beyond repair while others only suffered cosmetic damage. 268 people were reported to have died during the collapse of the six-story Ruby Tower, located at the corner of Doroteo Jose and Teodora Alonzo Streets in the district of Santa Cruz. The entire building, save for a portion of the first and second floors at its northern end, was destroyed. Allegations of poor design and construction, as well as use of low-quality building materials, arose. In the district of Santa Ana, one person was injured by debris from a damaged apartment building. Two more people from Aurora sub province and Pampanga died as a direct result of the quake. Around the town of Casiguran, there were several reports of landslides, the most destructive one at Casiguran Bay. Aftershocks The aftershock sequence throughout the month of August included many moderate shocks, including fifteen over 5.0 . The strongest of these occurred on August 3 with a 5.9 event that produced intensities of III‚ÄìIV in Manila. Aftermath and legacy The former location of Ruby Tower in Santa Cruz district is now a memorial hall which stands today.

An animal track is an imprint left behind in soil, snow, or mud, or on some other ground surface, by an animal walking across it. Animal tracks are used by hunters in tracking their prey and by naturalists to identify animals living in a given area. Books are commonly used to identify animal tracks, which may look different based on the weight of the particular animal and the type of strata in which they are made. Tracks can be fossilized over millions of years. It is for this reason we are able to see fossilized dinosaur tracks in some types of rock formations. These types of fossils are called trace fossils since they are a trace of an animal left behind rather than the animal itself. In paleontology, tracks often preserve as sandstone infill, forming a natural mold of the track. Gallery Image:Ant trail.jpgAnt trail. Image:Pronghorn Tracks.jpgAntelope tracks.

Today, none of these facilities remain and the only public buildings are pubs and restaurants. This decline began in the 1940s and can be attributed to increasing household car ownership (in the early 1940s 90% of households did not own a car).

An Australia national rugby league representative , he played for the Sydney City Roosters, the St. George Dragons before they merged to form the St. George Illawarra Dragons, with whom he continued playing, becoming the National Rugby League's top try-scorer for three consecutive seasons from 1999 to 2001. Blacklock also played in the Super League for Hull FC, with whom he won the 2005 Challenge Cup. Background Born in Tingha, New South Wales, Blacklock went on to gain the nickname, Tingha Tornado. Playing career =1990s= Blacklock began his professional career in 1995 at the Sydney City Roosters, before moving to the St George Dragons where he played between 1997 and 1998. In 1998, playing for the St George Dragons, he scored 20 tries from 22 games, the second highest in the competition that year. From 1999 to 2002, he played for the newly formed joint venture St George Illawarra Dragons. He played on the wing for the Dragons in their 1999 NRL Grand Final loss to Melbourne. In 1999, Blacklock scored 24 tries from 24 matches, the highest that year. Blacklock was the top try scorer in the Australian National Rugby League competition for three consecutive seasons whilst playing for the St George Illawarra Dragons between 1999 and 2001. It was the first time since the 1920s in Australian rugby league that a player had topped the try scoring list for three consecutive seasons. Blacklock was the first ever player to score 20 or more tries in 4 consecutive seasons. =2000s= In 2000 Blacklock scored 25 tries from 26 matches. In 2001 he scored an incredible 27 tries from 28 matches, thereby completing his treble as top try scorer. At the end of the 2001 NRL season, Blacklock went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. Blacklock was first selected for the Australian team in 2001, scoring two tries in Australia's 54-12 win over Papua New Guinea. He played one further Test, the Third Test against Great Britain at Wigan in 2001. Blacklock was controversially omitted from the NSW Blues 2001 State of Origin team despite being the stand out winger of the competition. State selectors claimed that Blacklock's omission was necessary due to his small size and possible deficiencies in defence, because he would have to mark up against larger wingers such as Wendell Sailor or Lote Tuqiri. Ironically the NSW Blues lost the series 2-1 and were humiliated in game 3 at AAMI Stadium by 40-14, where QLD wingers Lote Tuqiri and Wendell Sailor, as well as QLD centre Chris Walker ran riot over the selected NSW wingers Adam MacDougall and Jamie Ainscough, Ainscough coincidentally Blacklock's Dragons wing partner. During the 2002 NRL season Blacklock was granted a release from his contract with the Dragons in order to play rugby union. Some speculate that this move was motivated by the disappointment Blacklock felt after not being selected for State of Origin, despite being the leading try scorer three years running. After a short stint playing rugby union with the New South Wales Waratahs, Blacklock returned to the Dragons during the latter half of the 2003 NRL season, where he again proved his worth by scoring 14 tries in 12 games. 2004 was an average year for Blacklock, where injuries kept him off the field for long periods of time. Blacklock returned to help the Dragons at the end of the year, which included scoring crucial tries in the Dragons' round 25 come from behind win against Manly, as well as their narrow loss to the Panthers during the first week of the finals. From 1997 to 2004, Nathan Blacklock played 137 first grade games for the Dragons, scoring 120 tries and 14 goals for a total of 508 points, giving Blacklock one of the best try scoring strike rates of any Rugby League player. In his entire playing career from 1995 to 2004, Blacklock played 142 career first grade games. During that time he scored 121 tries and kicked 14 goals for a total of 512 points. At the end of 2004, Nathan Blacklock left the NRL in order to play in the Super League for English team Hull F.C. In his first season with Hull F.C. he scored 22-tries in all competitions, including a hat-trick away to the Huddersfield Giants and at home to the Leigh Centurions. He played for Hull F.C. on the in the 2005 Challenge Cup Final victory against the Leeds Rhinos. In August 2006, it was announced that Blacklock would have to retire from all forms of football due to a chronic knee injury. Blacklock had been planning to retire from the game at the end of the season but when the extent of his injury was discovered, the club decided to release Blacklock from his contract as he was no longer able to play. After his retirement was announced, Blacklock came out and stated, \\"I'm disappointed I've had to call it a day, but I simply can't give the 100% I want to anymore because of injuries. I can't put my heart and soul into playing. Everyone at the club has been great to me and I wish the team all the best for the play- offs and the future.\\" Skysports.com article: Injury Forces Blacklock To Quit. URL retrieved 24 August 2006. At the time of the news, Hull F.C. were sitting second on the Super League table and were a real chance to reach the Grand Final at Old Trafford for the first time in the Super League era. Hull F.C. coach Peter Sharp added that \\"'Tingha' has enjoyed a marvellous career, he has achieved some things in rugby league that most people can only dream about. In 2009 Blacklock played two games for the Tuggeranong Vikings. Nathan also played for the Muswellbrook Rams in the group 21 league.

The film version was released in 1960. Background The Roosevelt family at Campobello (1920) The original Broadway production was presented at the Cort Theatre by The Theatre Guild and Dore Schary and directed by Vincent J. Donehue. It opened on January 30, 1958 and closed on May 30, 1959 running for 556 performances. It starred Ralph Bellamy as Roosevelt. Bellamy won a Tony Award for Best Actor. Others in the cast included Henry Jones as Louis McHenry Howe; Mary Fickett as Eleanor Roosevelt; Anne Seymour as Sara Delano Roosevelt and, in his Broadway debut, James Earl Jones. Bellamy repeated his role in the film version of the play, but was not Oscar-nominated for his performance, though Greer Garson was Oscar-nominated for her performance as Eleanor. The production won three other Tonys including Best Play (producers were Lawrence Langner, Theresa Helburn, Armina Marshall and Dore Schary), Best Director of a Play (Vincent J. Donehue) and Henry Jones won for Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Mary Fickett was nominated for Best Supporting or Featured Actress in a Play. FDR nominating Al Smith at the 1924 Democratic National Convention (June 26, 1924) Campobello Island was Roosevelt's summer home in New Brunswick, Canada. Early scenes in the play's actions take place there, where we see Roosevelt afflicted with paralysis of his legs, before the play's story shifts to Roosevelt's home in New York City, where he struggles to overcome the paralysis. The play ends with the 1924 Democratic National Convention speech, which catapulted him back into politics after an absence of several years. Adaptations Ralph Bellamy stars in the 1960 film adaptation of Sunrise at Campobello, released by Warner Bros. Dore Schary, who began his career in Hollywood, wrote and produced the film which, like the stage version, was directed by Vincent J. Donehue. Greer Garson co-stars as Eleanor, with Hume Cronyn as Louis Howe. The role of Sara Delano Roosevelt, FDR's mother, is played Ann Shoemaker, who succeeded Anne Seymour in the role in the original Broadway production. Despite it being perhaps Bellamy's most famous role, it was Garson who received the critical attention. She won the Golden Globe and National Board of Review Award for Best Actress. The film received four Academy Award nominations: Best Actress (Garson), Art Direction, Sound and Costume Design. Historical basis Roosevelt was diagnosed with polio in 1921, but his symptoms are more consistent with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome - an autoimmune neuropathy which his doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility.

It operated long-distance, tourist and suburban bus services and freight trucking and parcel services. Its name was New Zealand Railways Road Motor Service until mid-1936. History Back cover of a commemorative publication about Railway Road Services in New Zealand published 1976, showing the buses used from 1926 to 1976. The first bus operation by NZR began on 1 October 1907, between Culverden on the Waiau Branch and Waiau Ferry in Canterbury. By the 1920s NZR was noticing a considerable downturn in rail passenger traffic on many lines due to increasing ownership of private cars, and from 1923 it began to coordinate rail passenger services with private bus services. In November 1926, NZR purchased a private bus firm operating between Hastings and Napier in the Hawke's Bay region. NZR then acquired various other bus services in Dunedin and the Hutt Valley, and by 1928 was operating 56 buses. In 1931 Parliament passed the Transport Licensing Act, which regulated local bus services to ensure that services would not compete with NZR. This further increased acquisitions by NZR of small bus companies.Railway Road Services KiwiRail There was a certain amount of rivalry within NZR between NZRRS and the rail Traffic Branch and in many ways they competed with rather than complement each other. For example, many cities had bus terminals some distance from railway stations and many NZRRS routes ran parallel to and at similar times to trains. By 1954 the bus routes covered , but generally at higher fares than the railways. For example, the Christchurch-Dunedin return journey cost ¬£2 13s 6d by rail, but ¬£3 10s by bus and took 7hr 10min on the fastest train, but 9hr by bus. Fleet Australian and New Zealand Railways Commissioners, Auckland, February 17 1951 Volvo Roadmaster Road Services - Coaches c1985 Early years of the Road Services saw many different brands of buses acquired with the various constituent companies. From Ford Model T-based cars to Straker steam trucks, to various Albion, Cadillac, Dodge and Leyland buses. The builders of the bodies were many and various. Leading up to World War II, standardisation was the call. During the 1940s Ford V8 and Bedford truck chassis with New Zealand Motor Bodies (NZMB) became the standard NZRRS bus. During the 1950s NZRRS began to widely use the Bedford SB chassis fitted with NZMB bodies. So much so, that the Bedford SB was ordered right up until 1980. NZRRS eventually bought 1,240 of these chassis, which were used in suburban, local rural, and long-distance service. This was the largest fleet of Bedford SB buses in the world. During the late 1970s NZRRS, like many other operators, was having issues with the general reliability of their fleet. Orders were made to Volvo and Hino in an effort to find a better vehicle. Hino and Volvo buses and coaches were purchased right up until the end of the NZRRS. Restructuring Road Services - Freightmaster Parcels Van, Wellington c1985 In 1985 the land operations of NZRC was restructured into market-based bi-modal (road and rail) business groups, rather than branches based on mode of transport, and as part of the new Passenger Business Group, NZRRS was split into three brands: *InterCity - long-haul passenger services *Cityline - urban passenger services *Speedlink - parcels services The freight trucking business was combined with rail freight into the Freight Business Group, branded Railfreight Systems. Privatisation Road and rail services were separated in 1991 when the rail and ferry operations of New Zealand Railways Corporation were transferred to New Zealand Rail Limited and the road transport operations were sold: *InterCity buses was sold in 1991 to InterCity Management Limited, a group of seven of the largest private coach companies - Whangarei Bus Company, Bayline Group, Ritchies Transport, Tranzit Group, Pacific Tourways, Gutherys Coachlines and Nelson SBL *Cityline in Wellington and Auckland to Wellington City Transport and subsequently to Stagecoach; in Dunedin to Newton's Coachways; New Plymouth to Waitara taken over by Withatruck Coachlines *Speedlink Parcels was sold to New Zealand Post.

He was the first Archbishop of the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut and a much respected leader of the Maronites during the 1859‚Äì1860 conflict in Mount Lebanon. Life Tobia Aoun was born in December 1803 in a small village along the banks of the Damour River in Lebanon, under the Maronite Patriarchy of Joseph VII Peter Tyan. He had five brothers: Abboud, Sleiman, Nasr, Shehdan, Salhab. In 1815, at the young age of 12, he joined the Congregation of the Virgin Mary. Three years later, at the age of 15, he joined the monastic order of the Antonins \\"Lebanese Maronite Order\\", vowing chastity, poverty, and obedience. On 30 September 1823, upon the recommendation of the monks of the monastery, he was ordained a priest by Maronite Patriarch Joseph VIII Peter Hobaish. In 1827, the same Maronite Patriarch called upon him to become his personal secretary. Satisfied with his hard work and dedication, the Maronite Patriarch requested that Aoun manage the finances of the Maronite Patriarchy, including the administration of the Maronite colleges and orphanages. On 13 March 1841, Patriarch Hobaish nominated him Maronite Bishop of Saint-John-Acre in partibus infidelium and Vicar General of the Patriarchy. Bishop Boutros Abu Karam, Maronite Bishop of Beirut since 18 November 1819, had died on 15 January 1844 thus leaving the Archbishopric of Beirut vacant. On 31 December 1844, Tobias Aoun was elected Archbishop of Beirut and installed in this archeparchy on February 9, 1845. The Maronite Patriarch's representative in Rome and Constantinople, Bishop Nicolas Murad, had been actively lobbying to become the new Archbishop of Beirut, but the Maronite Patriarch clearly confirmed Aoun as the new Archbishop. The Pope, however, suspended this confirmation upon the advice of the Apostolic Delegate, believing that neither Murad nor Aoun were suitable candidates for the Archbishopric of Beirut. A petition signed by 519 Maronite dignitaries protested the appointment of Aoun as Archbishop of Beirut, especially since Murad, they argued, had received a two-thirds majority. The French Consul in Beirut believed that the major Maronite families \\"favoured Murad because of his patriotism and devotion to the cause of his coreligionists\\". Bishop Aoun finally took possession of his chair on June 10, 1847. He would remain Archbishop of Beirut until his death. Tobia Aoun, wearing the insignia of the French Legion of Honour and the Ottoman Order of the Medjidie Tobia Aoun Tobia Aoun photographed in Rome, 1869 Tobia Aoun's signature in Rome, 1869 Bishop Tobia participated in two Maronite synods in electing the Patriarchs of the Maronite Church. According to Maronite procedures, the Patriarch is elected by the Maronite archbishops and bishops reunited in a synod, whereby a two-thirds majority is needed for the election to be validated. With the death of Patriarch Joseph Peter Hobaish on 23 May 1845, a synod was convened but did not meet until August due to the sectarian violence destabilizing Mount Lebanon in the early stages of the Double Qaimaqamate government. Bishop Joseph Ragi El Khazen was elected Patriarch on 18 August 1845 in Dimane and confirmed by Pope Gregory XVI on 19 January 1846. Nine years later, with the death of Patriarch Joseph IX Ragi El Khazen on 3 November 1854, Bishop Tobia participated in the synod of 12 November 1854 which elected Paul Peter Massad as Patriarch. This election was confirmed on 23 March 1855 by Pope Pius IX. Eug√®ne Poujade, the French Consul of Beirut in the 1840s, writes the following description of Bishop Tobias in his memoirs: \\"The Bishop of Saint-John-Acre, Mautran Tobia (Mautran is the name the Maronites give to their bishops), was a man of roughly forty years, of an imposing figure. His eye was small but full of finesse, softness, and sincerity. He is one of the most distinguished men that I have met in the Near-East. He only speaks Arabic but his superior spirit has him realize the genius of Europe, and it is he who has played the most important role in the political affairs of Lebanon. He had once been a monk and led a rebellion against the abbot of the Convent of Saint Anthony. For his actions, he was exiled to the Isle of Cyprus by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. Since then, his exemplary conduct has allowed him to successively be named Bishop of Saint-John-Acre in partibus and Bishop of Beirut, one of the most important diocese of Lebanon due to it being the residence of the muchir (governor) and the European general consuls. I've rarely seen in a man the same high degree of simplicity, gentleness, firmness, wisdom, the elevation of the soul and genuine Christian humility\\". The British envoy to Lebanon Sir Hugh Rose made the following description of Tobia Aoun on 9 September 1844: \\"Bishop Tubia is a violent, ambitious person of a Fellah family in the mixed district. He has strong anti-Druze and Ottoman feelings...at one time I thought that he had patriotic feelings; but if he has them, they are strongly mixed up with self-interest\\". This of course did not stop Rose in supporting Aoun over Murad as Archbishop of Beirut; writing to Aoun upon his nomination: \\"I was greatly pleased to hear you have been appointed over the bishopric of Beirut\\". Rose, writing to Bishop Aoun, expressed the desire that \\"we will always be friends\\". An 1862 publication on the history of Lebanon describes Aoun as \\"pretentious and arrogant with some people, clever and shy with others\\". He is described as \\"a real tyrant with small feet, who appears strong only when shielded far away from his enemy\\". Travels to Rome, Paris, Constantinople On 8 June 1862, Archbishop Tobia Aoun travelled to Rome and joined over 4000 Catholic priests in the canonization ceremony of the twenty-six Catholic martyrs of Japan. He was personally received by Pope Pius IX who named him Assistant to the Pontifical Throne, awarding him a gold and silver medal. Tobia Aoun In becoming Assistant to the Pontifical Throne, Tobia Aoun immediately entered the Papal nobility as Count of Rome. In 1862, Bishop Aoun was received by Emperor Napoleon III in Paris and awarded the French Legion of Honour. That same year, he was received by Sultan Abdul-Aziz in Constantinople and awarded the Ottoman Empire's Order of Medjidjie (Nishan-i-Majidia). In 1869, Tobia Aoun returned to Rome as Council Father of the Vatican Council called upon by Pope Pius IX. The Council had just met when King Victor Emmanuel II attacked Rome and deposed Pope Pius IX. Pius IX suspended the Council indefinitely on October 20, 1870. Tobias Aoun eventually returned home, dying on Holy Week April 4, 1871. Role in 1840‚Äì41, 1845 Civil Wars Concerning the 1840‚Äì1841 and 1845 civil conflicts in Mount Lebanon which followed the Crisis of 1840, the British envoy to Lebanon Sir Hugh Rose declared to Her Majesty's Secretary Lord Aberdeen on 17 May 1845 : \\"As regards the Maronite clergy, it is sufficient to say that they have organized the war...Your Lordship is already acquainted with the pecuniary aid given by Bishop Tubia for the purchase of arms. Indeed, when it is known that the Maronite Patriarch threatens to excommunicate those who do not obey the summons to go to war, all is said\\". On 4 May 1845, Sir Hugh Rose wrote to the British Ambassador in Constantinople, Sir Stratford Canning, stating that \\"the Maronite Patriarch, Bishop Tubia, and the clergy have taken a most decided line to induce the Christians to take arms\\". He states in the same letter that \\"Bishop Tubia gave 3000 piastres the other day to a village now burnt to purchase arms\\", as well as \\"a bond for 9000 piastres more for the same purpose\\". Aoun was responsible for drawing up a petition, signed by the Maronites, that \\"stated that under no circumstances whatever, would they, the Christians, ever voluntarily consent to be governed by a Turkish governor\\". Sir Hugh Rose explains on 12 January 1842 that \\"Bishop Tubia assembled the Christian deputies, both lay and clerical, and made them sign on the 10th ultimo a \\"Hedj√©\\", a writing by which they bound themselves to petition the Porte for a Prince of the House of Shehab, taking, moreover, an oath, that whoever violated it should be answerable both with his life and his property to the remainder (an Arab formula)\\". Sir Colonel Rose, 9 March 1844 As attested by the British Consul in Beirut Mr. Wood to Her Majesty's Secretary Henry John Temple Viscount Palmerston, Bishop Tobia played an active diplomatic role in establishing a new governing body for Lebanon following the 1840‚Äì1841 Civil War. In a letter dated 7 September 1841, Mr. Wood states: \\"Soon after my arrival, I received the visit of the Maronite Bishop Tubia, who was sent by the Patriarch to felicitate me, and to communicate to me the prelate's sentiments respecting the new arrangement to be made and the concessions granted by the Sublime Porte to the inhabitants of Lebanon\\". On 2 September 1841, the Maronite Patriarch wrote to Mr. Wood: \\"I send you Monsignor Tubia to converse with you, and to discuss this matter...I have again written to him, recommending him to communicate to you the impossibility of accomplishing your wishes\\". On 27 March 1842, Sir Hugh Rose wrote to Lord Aberdeen that \\"Bishop Tubia, in January, on an alarm of his arrest by the Turks, requested an asylum in my house, should it prove to be correct\\". Further proof of Tobia Aoun's role as diplomatic representative of the Maronite nation is attested by Sir Hugh Rose in a letter to Lord Aberdeen dated 7 June 1844 in which Rose states that Aoun is \\"the agent of the Patriarch and the real agent of the Maronite people, recognized as such by his Patriarch and the Turkish authorities in the important matters of the Government of the Mountain and the indemnities\\". In working towards the creation of a viable government for Mount Lebanon, Bishop Tobia declared to the Ottoman authorities on 20 March 1844 that the Christian deputies he represented would never \\"accept the Druze government, that they would rather that their heads should be cut off than accept that Government\\". The British Ambassador to the Ottoman Porte Sir Stratford Canning was satisfied by the diplomatic efforts of Bishop Aoun, stating on 17 September 1843 that \\"the moderation of the Christian party, as expressed by Bishop Tubia, is highly gratifying to those who take a real interest in the pacification of Mount Lebanon\\". Bishop Aoun had also served as the Patriarch's representative in the 'Indemnity Divan' which sought to restitute financial losses and offer compensation to all claimants who had suffered material losses during the 1840‚Äì1841 Civil War. Sir Hugh Rose confirms on 28 April 1844 that \\"Bishop Tubia (he is not himself a claimant) and those claiming compensation in and about Djouni deny strongly that any indemnity whatever has been paid for shops or coffee-shops in Djouni\\". On 10 August 1843, Bishop Aoun assured Sir Hugh Rose that \\"it was not his wish to ruin the Druzes by any excessive payment, but they should give a reasonable satisfaction to the Christians\\". Sir Hugh Rose states that Bishop Tobia declared: \\"Let the Druze, as a first step, restore at once all the plundered personal and moveable property still in their hands; and, secondly, let them engage to aid the building of such houses as were burnt by them. Let them do this; let them give this proof of atonement, and I will engage that the indemnification in money shall not be made a matter of difficulty by the Christians\\". Due to the various misunderstandings that arose during these meeting, Bishop Aoun decided to resign from his position at the Divan. Sir Hugh Rose states that both he and Mr. d'Adelbourg, the Austrian consul in Beirut, approved the Bishop's decision to resign. Though the deputies of the Divan requested that Aoun be \\"re- appointed, stating that he had great influence over them, and was devoted to their interests\\", the Ottoman authorities refused this option altogether. Sir Hugh Rose applauded this refusal, believing that \\"the absence of a political and violent bishop, possessing entire influence over a number of political agitators, was certainly, in the present state of affairs, much more desirable than his presence\\". In conclusion, it cannot be said that Sir Hugh Rose esteemed Bishop Tobia or the Maronites very much. On 9 August 1844, Rose deplored to Lord Aberdeen the \\"want of principle of all Arabs, both clergy and laity\\", stating that \\"they all, nearly without exception, have their price; if it is not money, it is something else\\". Rose affirmed in the same letter that \\"Bishop Tubia has given indication that his sternness is pliable; there have been secret requests on his part for permission to import corn duty free for his own house\\". Role in 1860 Civil War Bishop Aoun's role in the 1860 Civil War and its aftermath were much spoken of in the press and memoirs of the European diplomats who witnessed these events. In genuine calculated colonial strategy, their sentiments often shifted according to geopolitical alliances, with the Protestant British often at odds with the Bishop, and the Catholic French applauding his humanitarian and diplomatic efforts. The Franco-Maronite alliance, over a thousand years old, reached a culminating point in 1860 when Napoleon III dispatched 6000 French soldiers to Beirut in protection of the Maronites, essentially occupying Mount Lebanon with the approval of the Ottoman authorities. Though the French military presence would not last very long, it heightened tensions in London where British politicians were seeing the direct dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire to their geopolitical disadvantage. The possible colonization of Mount Lebanon by the French, applauded by the local Maronite clergy, was obviously contrary to British interests in the area. Khurshid Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Sidon, claimed \\"that at the beginning of the war, Maronite priests stirred up their parishioners by promising them that the French fleet would come to their assistance\\". For the Ottomans, European agents and local Maronites were responsible for enticing the war, with the ultimate goal of re-establishing a strong pro-European Christian government for Lebanon. Ultimately, the Ottomans would have no choice but to work with Tobia Aoun and the Maronite clergy in solidifying their rule over Mount Lebanon. This is best exemplified by the fact that Aoun, though attacked by the British as the prime instigator of the war, was immediately sent to the warring villages of Mount Lebanon by the Ottoman Porte's envoy, Fuad Pasha, to restore absolute peace and order in his name. In Bishop Aoun's archdiocese, a total of 67 churches were destroyed and 3 priests murdered in the 1860 Civil War. According to American Protestant missionary Henry Harris Jessup in Fifty-Three Years in Syria, Bishop Tobia was \\"the man who next to the Patriarch had done more than any other Maronite to precipitate this awful civil war\\". He writes of him numerous times as the \\"notorious Maronite Bishop Tobia\\". In the Missionary Herald, the official paper of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Jassup writes of Aoun on 14 March 1865 : \\"The Notorious Maronite Bishop came to (Baabda) with a swarm of priests, dispensing indulgences in accordance with the Pope's encyclical letter\\". 1860 Lebanon Civil War Lord Dufferin, the United Kingdom's extraordinary envoy to Lebanon in 1860‚Äì1861, wrote to Her Majesty's Secretary of State Lord John Russell in his Correspondence Relating to the Affairs of Syria: \\"With regard to Bishop Tobia, who may be considered one of the chief causes of all the misery and bloodshed which has existed in the Lebanon, I would only say that his removal from the country is an absolute necessity. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to discover any direct evidence against him...(His) ambition and passion for intrigue verify one's conception of the worst specimen of a medieval ecclesiastic\\". Lord Dufferin, writing to Her Majesty's Secretary of State Lord Russell on 19 December 1860, stated that Tobia Aoun exercised a \\"sinister influence\\" in Lebanon, and that his \\"withdrawal from Beirut was insisted upon as a necessary preliminary to all chance of peace\\". In this dispatch, Lord Dufferin insinuates that Tobia Aoun is responsible for the 20,000 pistols imported directly into Lebanon between 1857 and 1860. He refutes the notion that the Maronites are \\"saintly martyrs\\" but rather \\"as savage and bloodthirsty in their traditional warfare as their pagan neighbours\\". On 18 January 1861, Lord Dufferin wrote Henry Bulwer, British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, that during the Civil War the rebel Maronite leaders \\"were encouraged and countenanced in their excesses by Bishop Tobia and some of his brother ecclesiastics\\". In the British \\"Journal of the Foreign Affairs Committees\\" dated 4 December 1861, Tobia Aoun and the Maronite bishops are described as \\"unprincipled, ambitious priests\\", guilty of \\"wickedness and audacious treason\\". The same journal states that \\"It is really humiliating to hear men who call themselves the servants of Christ bellow forth the first principle of the devil: murder!\\". On 16 September 1860, the French general Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot wrote of Aoun: \\"I received today the visit of a figure who has, for many years, played a great role in all the affairs of Lebanon: it is Mgr. Tobie, Bishop of the Diocese of Beirut\\". An 1862 publication on the history of Lebanon states that Bishop Tobia was responsible for the conversion to Catholicism of Medjid Shehab, grandson of the famed Prince Beshir II. Having gone into exile to Constantinople with his grandfather Bashir II, Medjid had returned to Lebanon and was supported by Aoun and the Maronites as a possible candidate for governor of Mount Lebanon. In 1876, the French author and diplomat Eug√®ne-Melchior de Vog√º√© wrote of \\"the savage and heroic figure of Bishop Tobias leading his flock to combat\\".

It was built in 1879. The capacity is about 3.5 million cubic metres. It can be found from the A59 road. The overflow from the reservoir feeds directly into the adjoining Swinsty Reservoir. Formerly, this overflow was encircled by a metal walkway from which floodboards could be lowered,Washburn Valley Yesterday Vol II by David Alred. but this has since been removed. The reservoir is the property of Yorkshire Water, which manages it for the benefit of walkers, anglers and wildlife. Situated in the charming Washburn valley, sharing an embankment with Swinsty Reservoir, Fewston is popular with walkers and runners. Cyclists and horse-riders can also make use of their own permitted tracks in the surrounding woodlands.  Construction  The reservoir was built by the Leeds Waterworks Company under the management of Robert Brooks. Consultants were Thomas Hawksley of Westminster and Edward Filliter of Leeds. Work began in 1874 and was completed in 1879.Lesser Railways of the Yorkshire Dales and the Dam Builders in the Age of Steam by Harold D Bowtell, Early in the work, Fewston Mill was demolished, as was West House Mill at Blubberhouses, with the stone going to build a wall around the reservoir.

Among the members of the cult of Asclepius, votive offerings found at ritual centres at Epidaurus, Pergamum, and Rome detail the perceived effectiveness of the method. Incubation was adopted by certain Christian sects and is still used in a few Greek monasteries. Modern practices for influencing dream content by dream incubation use more research-driven techniques, but they sometimes incorporate elements reflecting these ancient beliefs. A form of incubation was also used by ancient Greeks iatromantes. According to Peter Kingsley, iatromantis figures belonged to a wider Greek and Asian shamanic tradition with origins in Central Asia. A main ecstatic, meditative practice of these healer-prophets was incubation (·ºêŒ≥Œ∫ŒøŒØŒºŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ, enkoimesis). More than just a medical technique, incubation reportedly allowed a human being to experience a fourth state of consciousness different from sleeping, dreaming, or ordinary waking: a state that Kingsley describes as ‚Äúconsciousness itself‚Äù and likens to the turiya or samƒÅdhi of the Indian yogic traditions.

In the US, it is published by VIZ Media. It was serialized in Nemurenu Yoru no Kimyou na Hanashi (\\"Mysterious Stories for Sleepless Nights\\"), as stated in volume 1 of the English version of Dolls. Story The stories revolve around some special dolls, the Plant Dolls, and the people who buy them. The dolls choose their owners, and desperately need their owners' love; they often reflect their owners' personalities for better or worse. Each story is independent of each other, though there may be references to knowledge learned in previous stories. Some stories have a fairy-tale like quality: they are eerie fables meant to warn against certain actions. There are several non-Plant-Doll related stories included in the Viz-released volumes as well. Plant Dolls Plant Dolls are living dolls. They drink milk warmed to body temperature three times a day, and take sugar cookies or cake once a week as fertilizer. Each doll is unique, though the same \\"model\\" can be available. They are \\"so expensive the price will make your eyeballs pop out,\\" and the accessories and care do not come cheap either. Plant Dolls look like young girls, but given improper treatment, they can mature. This is especially true if they are given anything to eat or drink other than milk and cookies. When they cry, their tears become valuable jewels called \\"Tears of Heaven\\". Plant Dolls are shown to have very lovely smiles, often deeply touching those who see them. There are two known models of Plant Dolls: potpourri dolls and singing dolls. Potpourri dolls take perfume balls with their meals and soon a pleasant scent can come from them. One of the earliest known singing dolls was Olympia, but she was later deemed an irregular model because she wasn't nourished for over a week but stayed the same way. Volumes =Volume 1= *Milk at Mealtimes: A man spoils his Plant Doll, and it matures into a \\"woman\\". *Potpourri Doll: A mentally unbalanced man buys his daughter a Plant Doll, and starts to obsess over the \\"nauseating scent\\" coming from it. *Snow White, Part I: A jeweller tries to obtain Tears of Heaven from a Plant Doll named Snow White. *Snow White, Part II: A poor man takes in a Plant Doll and dies from the exhaustion of taking care of it.

It is an important quality measurement of crude oil. The TAN value indicates to the crude oil refinery the potential of corrosion problems. It is usually the naphthenic acids in the crude oil that cause corrosion problems. This type of corrosion is referred to as naphthenic acid corrosion (NAC). TAN values may also be useful in other industries where oils are used as lubricants to determine oxidation and the subsequent corrosion risk to machinery. TAN value can be deduced by various methods, including * Potentiometric titration: The sample is normally dissolved in toluene and propanol with a little water and titrated with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (if sample is acidic). A glass electrode and reference electrode is immersed in the sample and connected to a voltmeter/potentiometer. The meter reading (in millivolts) is plotted against the volume of titrant. The end point is taken at the distinct inflection of the resulting titration curve corresponding to the basic buffer solution. * Color indicating titration: An appropriate pH color indicator e.g. phenolphthalein, is used. Titrant is added to the sample by means of a burette. The volume of titrant used to cause a permanent color change in the sample is recorded and used to calculate the TAN value. * Spectroscopic methods: as with many chemical parameters, spectroscopy can be used to make fast, accurate measurements once calibrated by a reference method. Mid and near infrared spectroscopy are most commonly used for this purpose.

During macro photography, using an internal focus lens reduces the risk of the front of the lens accidentally hitting the subject during focusing as the front element does not move.\\"Measuring focal length\\" The physical size of an internal focusing lens does not change during focus, nor does the front of the lens rotate.

The show premiered on August 23, 2006, at 10:30 P.M. EDT and subsequently was broadcast weekly on Wednesdays at the same time. The show began on MTV Canada on September 7, 2006, at 10 P.M. EDT. Repeat episodes of the show are also shown on CMT, MTV's sister channel, at various times.

Rush Propst controversy Coach Rush Propst was the subject of intense pressure after an investigation of charges that grades for some football players were changed to allow them to meet eligibility regulations and also came under fire for using ineligible players, which resulted in the Alabama High School Athletic Association forcing Hoover to forfeit four games. Propst came under further fire because of allegations of personal indiscretions, including extramarital affairs. On October 30, 2007, Propst resigned from the head coaching position of Hoover High School effective at the end of the season, while admitting to extramarital affairs and living a double life. Propst revealed he was married to two women and had children with both. Propst's career officially ended on November 24, 2007, as Hoover lost to arch-rival Vestavia Hills in a state quarterfinal playoff game. In January 2008, Propst accepted the head coaching job at Colquitt County High School in Moultrie, Georgia. In 2013, Propst returned to Hoover as coach of the Colquitt High School Packers to face off against the Bucs. Hoover won the game, 24‚Äì10. Prior to the game, Propst was featured on ESPN's E:60 series, where he revealed his extramarital affairs cost him a job with Nick Saban's coaching staff at Alabama, and he recently survived throat cancer. Propst remains in Georgia with Stefnie (the woman he had an affair with) and their children. Both Rush and Stefnie called their relationship \\"love at first sight.\\"http://espn.go.com/espn/e60/story/_/id/9611293/the-confessions-rush- propst Season 3 As Hoover High School continued to struggle with controversy over allegations of wrongdoings in its athletic program and in Propst's personal life, Humidity Entertainment declined to exercise its option for a third season. Instead, it announced that a similar program called Varsity Inc. would be filmed at West Monroe High School in West Monroe, Louisiana. The program was to be aired on ESPN2 and would focus more on the football program and less on the private lives of its players and coaches. Music * The opening song was \\"The War\\" by Angels & Airwaves. * The closing song for Season 1 was \\"Everything I've Ever Wanted\\" by Day at the Fair. * The closing song for Season 2 was \\"Say Anything (Else)\\" by Cartel. Two-A-Days Basketball Edition In 2007, the producers of Two-A-Days decided to create a basketball spin-off version of the original series. They chose Ballard High School in Louisville, Kentucky as the most desirable location because of the school's strong basketball tradition as well as the state of Kentucky's love of basketball. The crew started filming at the school for a short time until the Jefferson County Public School board rejected MTV's contract on the grounds that it would be a distraction to the school. Elizabethtown High School in Elizabethtown also allowed film crews to document the lives of another basketball season, but this was discontinued due to similar issues that JCPS had.

Both killings were considered to have been self-defense. For four months he was a deputy sheriff in Tombstone, Arizona Territory for Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan. Stilwell owned interests in several mines and various businesses, including a saloon, a wholesale liquor business, a stage line, and at his death livery stables in Charleston and Bisbee. He was also a partner in a Bisbee-area saloon with ex- Texas Ranger Pete Spence. He was closely involved in the events leading up to and following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, and was suspected in the murder of Morgan Earp on March 18, 1882. Two days after Morgan's death, Frank Stilwell was killed by Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp in a Tucson train yard. Arrest warrants were issued for Earp and four others in his gang suspected of murdering Stilwell. Murder indictments were issued at Pima County for Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Warren Earp, Sherman McMaster and John Johnson. Earp agreed to turn himself in but instead fled the Arizona Territory for Colorado. Wyatt Earp admitted late in his life to killing Stilwell at close range with a shotgun. Early life Frank was the son of William \\"Henry\\" Stilwell and Charlotte B. \\"Sarah\\" Winfrey. Frank was born in Iowa in 1856 (as estimated from his self-reported age of 24 in the 1880 census). His family moved shortly afterward near Palmyra, Kansas Territory, on the Santa Fe Trail. In 1863 William and Charlotte divorced and William left with the three boys, Jack, Millard and Frank. Charlotte took the girls Elizabeth and Mary. Frank's father was a Private in the Union Army with Company B, 18th Missouri Volunteer Infantry, under General William Tecumseh Sherman and took part in Sherman's March to the Sea. His older brother Simpson \\"Comanche Jack\\" Stilwell was an Indian fighter, scout, Deputy U.S. Marshal, police judge, and U.S. Commissioner. Arrival in Arizona Frank and his brother Simpson traveled from Anadarko, Indian Territory to Prescott, Arizona Territory in 1877. =Acquitted for two murders= While in Prescott, Frank worked at nearby Miller's Ranch. On October 18, 1877, newly hired cook Jesus Bega brought Frank tea instead of coffee, and after an argument Frank shot Bega through the lung, killing him. Frank was later acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. When Frank's brother Simpson left Arizona for Fort Davis, Texas Frank remained in Arizona. He worked as a teamster for C. H. \\"Ham\\" Light. Frank later staked a claim and worked a mine in Mohave County and on November 9, 1879, got into an argument over claim-jumping with Col. John Van Houten. Van Houten was brutally beaten in the face with a rock and died. Frank Stilwell and James Cassidy were charged with his murder but escaped a grand jury indictment for lack of evidence. In the 1880 census he listed himself as 24 years old, and living in Charleston, occupation \\"keeping livery,\\" and reported that he had been born in Texas. = Named deputy sheriff = Stilwell was hired as an assistant deputy sheriff by Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan in April, 1881. Four months later, in August, Behan fired him for \\"accounting irregularities\\". = Arrested and acquitted for robbery = On September 8, 1881, a passenger stage on the 'Sandy Bob Line' in the Tombstone area bound for Bisbee, Arizona was robbed. The masked bandits robbed all of the passengers of their valuables and the strongbox of about $2,500. During the robbery, the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as \\"sugar\\", a phrase known to be used by Frank. Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with the sheriff's posse attempting to track the robbers. At the scene of the holdup, Wells, Fargo & Co. undercover agent Fred Dodge discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Frank Stilwell. When Stilwell arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp, Special Police Officer Wyatt Earp, and Cochise County Deputy Sheriff Billy Breakenridge arrested them for the robbery. Stilwell and Spence were arraigned before Judge Wells Spicer and posted $7,000 bond, paid by C.H. \\"Ham\\" Light. At the preliminary hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. The distinctive boot print and the use of the word \\"sugar\\" to describe money was not enough to convict Stilwell, and Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just as he had done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year. On October 13, two weeks after Frank was acquitted on the state charges, Virgil in his role as Deputy U.S. Marshal filed new federal charges against Stilwell and Spence for the federal crime of interfering with a mail carrier. Virgil took Stilwell and Spence to Tucson for arraignment where they were held at the territorial jail. While Virgil was in Tucson, he deputized Wyatt to act in his place as assistant city marshal in Tombstone. The Cowboys thought the new arrest was in regard to a separate stage robbery that had occurred five days before October 8 near Contention City, and saw the new arrest as evidence that Stilwell and Spence were being unfairly harassed and targeted by the Earps for any stage robbery. They let the Earps know they could expect retaliation. While Wyatt and Virgil were in Tucson for the federal hearing on the charges against Stilwell and Spence, Cowboy Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, Spence and Stilwell being friends of McLaury and his brother Tom. He told Morgan that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again. The Tombstone Epitaph reported \\"that since the arrest of Spence and Stilwell, veiled threats [are] being made that the friends of the accused will 'get the Earps.'\\" The newspapers misreported that Stilwell and Spence had been arrested for the different recent October 8 stage robbery near Contention City, probably helping to lead to the mistaken conviction that Stilwell and Spence were being persecuted by the law. =Murder of Morgan Earp= The day after Morgan Earp's assassination, Coroner Dr. H. M. Mathews held an inquest in which Pete Spence's wife, Marietta Duarte, stated that her husband and Frank Stilwell, Indian Charlie, Frederick Bode and an unnamed half-breed had returned home only one hour after the shooting, and that her husband had threatened her with violence if she told what she knew. Witnesses said they saw former Cochise County Sheriff's Deputy Frank Stilwell running from the scene. The Coroner's jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, a man named Fries, and Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" were suspected in Morgan Earp's assassination. Spence immediately turned himself in so that he would be protected in Behan's jail. Wyatt Earp felt he could not rely on the court system and decided to take matters into his own hands. He concluded that the only way to deal with Virgil and Morgan's attackers was to kill them. Stilwell's death in Tucson On March 20, Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp received information that Frank Stilwell, Ike Clanton, Hank Swilling, and another cowboy were watching the passenger trains in Tucson intending to kill Virgil Earp. Wyatt and his assistant deputies Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson, and Sherman McMaster accompanied Virgil and Allie to the rail head in Benson. Fearing another attack, they decided to stay with Virgil and his wife aboard the train to Tucson, armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. McMaster wore two belts of cartridges. Virgil said later that he had Allie wear his pistol belt where he could easily have access to the weapon if he should need it. Virgil and Allie were scheduled to catch a train in Tucson for Colton, California, where the Earp's parents lived. Upon their arrival in Tucson, the Earp posse spotted Stilwell and other Cowboys. \\"Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth\\", Virgil later told the San Francisco Examiner. \\"They fell back into the crowd as soon as they saw I had an escort, and the boys took me to the hotel to supper.\\" Watched over by the well-armed Wyatt and his posse, Virgil and Allie had dinner in Tucson at Porter's Hotel, then reboarded the train. As the train pulled away from the station, gunfire was heard. Witnesses said they saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone. Wyatt later told his biographers that he saw Frank Stilwell, and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton, armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar. When Wyatt and his men approached, the two men ran. Stilwell stumbled, allowing Wyatt to catch him. In a story published on May 14, 1893, Wyatt told a reporter for the Denver Republican he shot Stilwell as he attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Ike Clanton escaped. Afterward, he gave interviews to the newspapers in which he claimed that he and Stilwell had been in Tucson to respond to federal charges of interfering with a U.S. mail carrier, stemming from Stilwell's alleged participation in robbing the Bisbee stage on September 8, 1881. According to Ike, Stilwell disappeared from the hotel before he was found shot dead by the tracks several blocks away.Joseph Miller, Arizona:The Last Frontier, Hastings House, Publishers (January 1, 1956) Ike said they heard that the Earps were coming via train and had plans to kill Stilwell. Other accounts reported that Clanton and Stilwell went to the train depot to meet a witness named McDowell who was to appear before the grand jury. Only upon their arrival at the depot did they learn the Earps were in Tucson. Stilwell's body was found the next day alongside the tracks riddled with two rounds of buckshot, one in his leg and the other in his chest marked with powder burns, along with four other bullet wounds. His own pistol had not been fired. George Hand, who saw the body, said Stilwell was \\"the worst shot up man I ever saw.\\" =Earp's story= In a 1926 interview with biographer John H. Flood, Wyatt said that they spotted Stilwell and Clanton armed on a flatcar in the train yard, apparently waiting to ambush the Earps. Both men ran after being confronted by the armed Earp party. Stilwell dropped his weapon and stumbled as he ran in the dark train yard, and Wyatt caught up to him and killed him with a point-blank shotgun blast under the ribs as Stilwell tried to fend off Earp's weapon. Wyatt reported that Stilwell's last words were \\"Morg! Morg!\\", probably referring to Morgan Earp. Wyatt credited himself as the one who fatally shot Stilwell with a shotgun, although Holliday may have likely killed him as he was the only one documented to have carried a shotgun at that time. In a March 1882 interview with the Arizona Daily Star, Virgil Earp told the reporter \\"Before Stilwell died he confessed that he killed Morg and gave the names of those who were implicated with him. When my brothers were leaving Arizona they got dispatches from Tucson saying that Stilwell and a party of friends were watching all the railroad trains passing that way, and they were going through them in search of all Earps and their friends, carrying shotguns under their overcoats and promising to kill on sight. Our boys were bound to look out for themselves, and when they got near Tucson were very cautious. They found Stilwell near the track and killed him.\\" Originally published in the Arizona Daily Star on May 30, 1882. Frank's brother \\"Comanche Jack\\" Stilwell soon heard of his brother's death and went west with hopes of avenging him, but he never reached Tombstone and soon went back without doing so. =Coroner's jury investigation= J.W. Evans witnessed Doc Holliday getting off the train with two shotguns and walk towards the railroad station office and then return without them. He talked to Wyatt Earp at the Porter Hotel near the station and shook hands with Virgil when he arrived. He testified at the inquest that the Earps were not armed, but that he had seen Stilwell, and thought he saw a bulge under his coat that indicated a pistol. He also said he saw Ike Clanton at the depot. Witness David Gibson also saw the Earps and Doc Holliday at the station. He said that when they walked from Porter Hotel to the station, they appeared to be looking for someone. He said Holliday was carrying a pistol holster over his shoulder and the two Earps were each carrying a short messenger shotgun. He watched the Earps get on the train and one of them inspected the far side of the train, looking up and down the tracks. They first walked towards the rear of the train and then towards the front. Alman J. Hinckley witnessed the shooting from a distance. He saw gun flashes and six to ten men standing on the south side of the track at 7:30 p.m. near where Stilwell's body was later found. He did not see where the men went afterward. =Shot by five weapons= Dr. Dexter Lloyd examined Stilwell's body and found a bullet wound that passed through his entire body from arm pit through the upper portion of his lungs and out the other arm pit. A second rifle bullet wound had passed through his upper left arm. One round of buckshot left six holes within a radius of , and penetrated his liver, stomach, and abdomen, leaving powder burns on his coat. A second round of buckshot had hit his left leg, breaking the bone, and a rifle shot had struck the fleshy portion of his right leg. Either the shot through the lungs or the buckshot in the abdomen was sufficient to kill him. The coroner reported that Stilwell had been shot by five different weapons. =Earp prosecution sought= The Tucson court issued arrest warrants for Wyatt Earp, Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, Jack Johnson, and Sherman McMaster. On May 16, 1882, the sheriff of Arapahoe County, Colorado notified Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan that he had Wyatt and Warren Earp in his custody, along with Doc Holliday. Behan applied to the governor for money to go to Colorado to bring the Earps back, but Governor Fremont instead gave the funds to Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul. Paul had received word on the same day from Denver that the sheriff there had five of the Earp party in custody. When Paul arrived in Denver, he served a warrant for Doc Holliday's arrest on charges that he killed Frank Stilwell in Tucson. Wyatt Earp, also in Denver, feared for Holliday's life if he was returned to Tombstone. He asked his friend in Trinidad, Colorado, Sheriff Bat Masterson, to help get Holliday released. Sheriff Masterson appealed to Governor Frederick W. Pitkin and succeeded in getting Holliday released from jail. Paul knew of warrants for the Earps' arrest, but he was a friend of the men and never served the warrants. =Burial= The Tucson Weekly Citizen reported on March 28, 1882, that Stilwell \\"was buried this afternoon, the coffin being conveyed to the grave in an express wagon, unfollowed by a single mourner.\\" Stilwell was originally buried in the old Tucson City cemetery, but when the cemetery was moved, most of the residents were reburied in a mass grave in the Evergreen Cemetery in Tucson. In popular culture =Memorial statue= This is the location of the 1880s Tucson Depot. It was in this location where Frank Stilwell, suspected in the murder of Morgan Earp on March 18, 1882, was killed by Wyatt Earp in the company of Doc Holliday. The location is now part of the Amtrak Station which is located at 400 N. Toole Ave. in Tucson, AZ. Life-sized statues of both Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday stand at the approximate site of where Stilwell was encountered by Wyatt Earp and his posse, at the former Tucson Southern Pacific Depot, and began their pursuit of Stilwell. The buildings that are there now are not the ones that were at the station in 1882, and the building that is there where the statues are placed at is the former Railway Express building, but in 1882, it is where the Porter Hotel (later renamed San Xavier Hotel) building was. The hotel was destroyed in a fire just after the turn of the century, and the original depot itself was demolished shortly after the completion of the current depot and its buildings in 1907. The Southern Arizona Transportation Museum conducts tours of the site and the rest of the Historic Depot upon request. =Media portrayals= Stillwell was portrayed by John Baxter in Season 5 of the Television Show The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp starring Hugh O'Brien as Earp. The death of Stilwell is prominently featured in the 1993 film Tombstone, in which he was played by Tomas Arana. Stilwell was then portrayed by John Dennis Johnston in the 1994 film Wyatt Earp.

Takamine (born January 29, 1953) is an Okinawan-American Hawaii state senator and state representative (1984‚Äì2007). A Democrat, he represents the first district on the island of Hawai'i. Early life and education Takamine, the eldest of five children, was born January 29, 1953, and raised in the plantation community of Honokaa to Yoshito and Kimiko Takamine. Yoshito Takamine served in the Hawaii State House of Representatives from 1959 to 1984. Takamine attended Honokaa Elementary School and Honokaa High School where he excelled both athletically and scholastically. In 1971, Takamine graduated High School as class valedictorian. Takamine went on to earn a bachelor's degree in psychology while participating in the ethnic studies program at the University of Hawai\`i at Manoa (UH). Takamine subsequently studied law at UH and received his law degree from the William S. Richardson School of Law in 1978. Career After graduating, Takmine began practicing law in Honolulu. In 1983, he opened his own law office in Hilo, Hawaii as his father Yoshito Takamine resigned after 26 years in the Hawaii House of Representatives. The younger Takamine took his father's seat in 1984. Takamine maintains a house in Laupahoehoe but usually lives in Honolulu with his second wife who is a school official there. He has continued to practice labor law, focusing on workers' compensation cases. On behalf of the ILWU, whose ties to the Takamines go back decades, Takamine has pushed a lumber mill in Ookala, and a wood-burning power plant in Paauilo. Local residents are against both proposals. Takamine and his father played a key role in the controversial 1980s Kamehameha Schools (formerly Bishop Estate) decision to buy the Hamakua Sugar Company lands and then plant them in eucalyptus. Since 1984, Takamine served as the State Representative for the Big Island's 1st District until 2007 when he was elected as the State Senator for District 1. During one campaign he \\"went to bat\\" at the century-old local Kalanianaole Elementary and Middle School located on the Hamakua Coast. With the demise of the jobs of the sugar-cane industry, the school had declined when Takamine stepped in and revived interest. His roles in the legislature as a Representative have included serving as Chair of several committees, notably the Finance Committee from 1998-2006. He was deposed from this position on the Finance Committee during pre-2007-session faction fighting in the Democratic caucus. During the 2006 campaign, Takamine had co-hosted an official Akaka campaign rally at the Honokaa ranch of Larry Mehau. Takamine and numerous other Democratic elected officials and candidates were photographed there by Hawai'i Free Press photojournalists. In this time, different factions were supporting their respective leaders for chair positions. When his faction failed to seat their leader, he was subsequently stripped of his committee chairmanship. He then ran for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen Lorrane Inouye. Dwight Takamine was elected November 4, 2008, as a candidate for the State Senate District 1 which includes Hilo, Hamakua, and Kamuela. His opponent was Republican Ted Hong, a former member of the UH Board of Regents and the former state labor negotiator. Takamine campaigned for President Barack Obama. Personal Takamine is married to Carol who has focused her career on early childhood education. They have a blended family and three sons. Galen is a college student currently attending Azusa Pacific University, and Aaron and Trevor are in high school.

He was one of the most successful preachers of Jamaican Revivalism. Along with Joseph Robert Love, Bedward was one of the forerunners of Marcus Garvey and his brand of pan-Africanism. Early Life In his twenties, Bedward worked on the construction of the Panama Canal. Jamaican labourers were subjected to harsh working conditions, before being boarded up at night in shoddy, disease-ridden shacks. In addition, white American workers were paid significantly more than their black counterparts. This experience would have a profound effect on Bedward's later life.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. Bedward had charisma, an acute sense of theatre, a scorching sense of injustice, and unshakeable faith in the righteousness of his words and deeds.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. Native Baptist Preacher After spending time in Panama, he returned to Jamaica and was baptized by a local Baptist preacher. He became not merely leader of a Revival branch but of a new movement, the Bedwardites. White and mixed-race Jamaicans worried about the African influences on these Native Baptist interpretations of Christianity.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. In the 1880s, he started to gather large groups of followers by conducting services which included reports of mass healings. He identified himself with Paul Bogle, the Baptist leader of the Morant Bay rebellion, and he stressed the need for changes to the inequalities in race relations in Jamaican society. He reportedly said: ‚ÄúBrethren! Hell will be your position if you do not rise up and crush the white man. The time is coming! There is a white wall and a black wall. And the white wall has been closing around the black wall: but now the black wall has become bigger than the white.‚ÄùDaily Gleaner, 15 December 1920. Many Afro-Jamaican Christian churches sprung up in the aftermath of Emancipation. In 1889, Bedward became the leader of one of them, the Jamaica Native Baptist Free Church. He ministered to his flock by Hope River, and his congregation grew large and thrived. He warned that the government of the Colony of Jamaica was passing laws to oppress black people, and was robbing them of their money and their bread.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. By 1894, the Native Baptist Free Church was so thriving that it was able to commission a temple on the banks of the river, a confirmation in stone and slate that the Great Revival had produced genuine competition to the traditional centres of community power.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. In 1895, Bedward was arrested for sedition but sent to a mental asylum. Critics within the government succeeded in having Bedward sectioned in a mental asylum, but with the help of a sympathetic lawyer, Bedward secured his freedom.On release he continued his role as a Revival healer and preacher. He stressed his followers to be self-sufficient and at its height the movement gathered about 30,000 followers. He told his followers to sell their possessions including owned land and give him all the profits. Some of these followers did just that.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. Over the next quarter century, Bedward became an antiestablishment hero, preaching a message of black power. The crowds at Hope River grew larger, and increasing numbers committed to his regime of fasting and temperance. Events such as the First World War fitted into his message that God was punishing the white Western world for hundreds of years of avarice, corruption and brutality.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. Claimed he could fly Later Bedward proclaimed that he was a reincarnation of Jesus Christ and that, like Elijah, he would ascend into heaven in a flaming chariot. He then expected to rain down fire on those that did not follow him, thereby destroying the whole world. He and 800 followers marched in to Kingston ‚Äúto do battle with his enemies.‚Äù On New Year's Eve, in 1920, now an old man, Bedward told his followers that he had been called by the Lord to fly up to heaven. His ascent, he promised his followers, would hasten the Rapture; before the sun had set, he would be gone and they would be free.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. It is reported that thousands of his followers and critics turned up to see if his ascension would take place. He took to his chariot, which was a chair balanced in a tree, and declared that his ascension would take place at ten o'clock that morning. He later revised the time of his ascension to three in the afternoon, and then ten in the evening. But no ascension took place.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. Eventually, he climbed down from the tree, and went home.

In 1921, Bedward and his followers were arrested and he was sent to mental asylum for the second time where he remained to the end of his life. In 1930, he died in his cell from natural causes.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. Legacy and Garveyism His contemporary, Robert Love, the inspirational advocate of racial uplift via education and political engagement, always thought Bedward to be nothing more than a skilled showman whom a hysterical establishment had managed to turn into a martyr.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. Bedwardism planted a seed from which a culture of racial consciousness grew, and found its most emphatic form in Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). With Garvey‚Äôs rise to prominence in the 1910s, Bedward became convinced that God had only ever intended for him to be one of a sequence of prophets rather than a messiah ‚Äî Aaron to Garvey‚Äôs Moses is how he termed it ‚Äî paving the way for the younger man to deliver his people into the Promised Land. He led his followers into Garveyism by finding the charismatic metaphor: one the high priest, the other prophet, both leading the children of Israel out of exile.Edward White, Rise Up (5 October 2016) https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/05/rise-up/ Retrieved 30 July 2020. His impact was that many of his followers became Garveyites and Rastafarians, bringing with them the experience of resisting the system and demanding changes of the colonial oppression and the white oppression. Rastafari has taken the idea of Garvey as a prophet, while also casting him in the role of John the Baptist, by virtue of his \\"voice in the wilderness\\" call taken as heralding their expected Messiah, \\"Look to Africa where a black king shall be crowned.\\" Kei Miller wrote a novel about Bedward entitled \\"Augustown\\", published in Britain in 2016. One of the followers of Bedwardism was Robert Hinds, the second-in-command to Leonard Howell's nascent Rastafarianism. Songs Bedward is mentioned in an early Trinidadian recording of Jamaican mento classic Sly Mongoose by Sam Manning, who recorded it in December 1925 for the Okeh label (the song was recorded by many artists with changing lyrics). He is mentioned in Jamaican reggae artist Etana's \\"I Am Not Afraid.\\" He is also mentioned in the Jamaican folk classic \\"Dip Dem,\\" which was recorded by Louise Bennett for her 1954 album Jamaican Folk Songs. The famous refrain from the Jamaican folk went: ‚ÄúDip dem, Bedward, dip dem / Dip dem in the healing stream / Dip dem deep, but not too deep / dip dem fi cure bad feeling.‚Äù \\"Bedward the Flying Preacher\\" by Singers & Players featuring Prince Far I appears on the 1983 album Staggering Heights, and the 1985 compilation Pay It All Back Vol. 1, both on Britain's On-U Sound label.

Wright was born in Montreal, Quebec, and currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia. In addition to NoMeansno and The Hanson Brothers, both of which feature his brother John and guitarist Tom Holliston, Wright has composed and recorded an occasional solo act called Mr. Wrong where he sings and plays bass while performing in an authoritarian priest outfit. He has also recorded with Ford Pier, Itch and the instrumental progressive power-trio Removal (as the Mr. Wrong character in the latter.) In the late '70s and early '80s, Wright dabbled in record production, recording and/or producing many noted underground BC punk groups, most notably the Neos. As a bassist, Wright utilizes a distinct technique to create a sound that relies on frequencies traditionally associated with a guitar. He took the inspiration for his amplification (involving a Marshall solid state head through a Marshall guitar 4x12 cabinet) from Lemmy Kilmister of Mot√∂rhead, and has cited jazz bassists such as Jimmy Blanton and Paul Chambers as influential players. His hard-picked, fast-fretted playing is highly respected among bassists, and has been praised by Mike Watt of The Minutemen, among other musicians.

Etymology The name comes from the Sanskrit words ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ sukha, \\"pleasure\\", and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The 19th century Sritattvanidhi describes and illustrates the pose. The name, and the more general name Yogasana which may denote a variety of similar poses, is found in much older documents as a meditation seat, such as in the 4th century Darshana Upanishad. Description While opening the hips and lengthening the spine, the asana's relative ease on the knees makes it easier than siddhasana or padmasana for people with physical difficulties. Some schools do not consider it to be as effective for prolonged meditation sessions because it is easy to slump forward while sitting in it. For meditation, it is important that the spine be straight and aligned with the head and neck. But if the practitioner steadies the sukhasana pose by putting pillows or blankets under the knees to create a steadiness, it may be easier to sit longer in sukhasana for meditation without slumping forward. An additional blanket or pillow under the buttocks may also be beneficial and steadying.Rama, Swami, Meditation and its Practice, Himalayan Institute, 1992 The 20th century Jnana Yoga guru Ramana Maharshi advocated it as suitable for attaining Enlightenment.

The school first opened in 1927 and is operated by the Toronto District School Board. Prior to 1998, the school was part of the Board of Education for the City of York. Runnymede has a population of 500 students and has a variety of course offerings ranging from computer technology to co- operative education, from modern languages to music. The motto of this school is Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum (\\"No Steps Back\\"). History Runnymede Collegiate Institute was completed and officially opened on November 11, 1927, although classes had begun on September 6 for 250 students and a staff of 10 teachers led by Principal Bruce W. Clark. The original Collegiate Gothic building was designed by Charles Wellington Smith and consisted of eight classrooms, three science labs, an auditorium, a library, a gymnasium, a cafeteria and a locker area on three floors. Significant additions to the building were completed in 1928, 1958 and 1966. The building now includes over 30 classrooms, a swimming pool, two gyms, computers labs and a large cafeteria. The school was built on land, which had belonged to John Scarlett. His is estate was called ‚ÄúRunnymede‚Äù after the field of Runnymede, where King John of England signed the Magna Carta. The school's colours, red and white, derive partly from Scarlett's name, and also from the fact that the school opened in the year of Canada's Diamond Jubilee. Owing to their red school jackets, Runnymede students came to be known as Redmen in the 1930s. Over time an Indian head logo was adopted to go with the name. The Redmen name and logo were retired in 1994. Runnymede Collegiate Institute celebrated its 90th anniversary on Saturday, May 6, 2017. Hundreds of alumni, former teachers, and current students attended the reunion. There were \\"decade rooms\\" where former students from each decade would meet up with their classmates and teachers.  Clubs Runnymede Collegiate Institute offers a number of different clubs and extracurricular activities. To join a club, students must pay an initial \\"activity fee\\" of $30 and $15 thereafter for each additional clubs they join. Some of the activities are listed below: * Badminton Club * Baseball (boys and girls) * Basketball (varsity, junior and senior) * Black Students Association club * Cheerleading * Cross Country * Dance Club * Environmental Club * FIRST Robotics Competition (Robotics) Team 1310 * Hockey (co-ed) * International Club * Leadership * Math Club * Me to We Club * Mental Health and Wellness Club * Power Yoga * QSA Club * Right to Play * Soccer (junior and senior) * Swim Team * Tech Crew * Track and Field * Volleyball (Junior and senior girls, co-ed) * Yearbook Club The Robotics Team is the biggest club in Runnymede with over 60 students every year.

She wrote it when she was nine years old and part of its appeal lies in its juvenile innocence, and its unconventional grammar and spelling. It was reprinted 18 times in its first year alone.  Plot  Alfred Salteena, an \\"elderly man of 42\\", has invited 17-year-old Ethel Monticue to stay with him. They receive an invitation to visit Alfred's friend, Bernard Clark, which they readily accept. Bernard is \\"inclined to be rich\\". Shortly after their arrival, Ethel and Bernard become attracted to each other. Alfred seeks Bernard's advice on how to become a gentleman. Bernard is doubtful that this can be managed, but writes an introduction to his friend the Earl of Clincham. Alfred excitedly rushes off to London to visit the Earl, leaving Ethel alone and unchaperoned with Bernard. Lord Clincham lives, as many other aristocrats do, in \\"compartements\\" at the Crystal Palace. He agrees to assist Alfred and instals him in a subterranean \\"compartement\\", along with other \\"apprentice gentlemen\\". He invites Alfred to accompany him to a reception hosted by the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), introducing Salteena as Lord Hyssops. The Prince is impressed, and promises to assist the trembling and overjoyed Salteena. Bernard and Ethel fall in love and marry. Devastated by these events, Salteena marries a maid-in-waiting at Buckingham Palace. Lord Clincham also marries, but not very happily.  Composition and publication  Ashford wrote the novel in an exercise book at the age of nine in 1890. Full of spelling mistakes, each chapter was written as a single paragraph. Many years later, in 1917 and aged 36, Ashford rediscovered her manuscript languishing in a drawer, and lent it to Margaret Mackenzie, a friend who was recovering from influenza. It passed through several other hands before it reached Frank Swinnerton, a novelist who was also a reader for the publishers Chatto and Windus. Largely due to Swinnerton's enthusiasm for this piece of juvenilia, the book was published almost exactly as it had been written. J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan, agreed to write a preface.  Reception  The book was so successful that it was reprinted 18 times in its first year alone. After its publication rumours soon started that the book was in fact an elaborate literary hoax and that it had been written by J. M. Barrie himself. These rumours persisted for years.  Adaptations  A stage play of The Young Visiters by Mrs George Norman and Margaret Mackenzie was first performed in London in 1920 and transferred shortly afterwards to New York. The New York production, at the Thirty-Ninth Street Theatre, received generally good reviews; one reviewer stated that > The Young Visiters ... has been turned into a play by the simple use of a > pair of shears and a pot of paste. Probably no novel was ever so reverently > dramatized since the world began. A musical based on the book, by Michael Ashton and Ian Kellam, was produced in 1968, a feature-length film was made in 1984 starring Tracey Ullman and John Standing, and a television film version was made by the BBC in 2003, starring Jim Broadbent as Alfred Salteena, Lyndsey Marshal as Ethel Monticue and Hugh Laurie as Lord Bernard Clark. The screenplay was written by Patrick Barlow and it was directed by David Yates. The original manuscript of The Young Visiters is held in the Berg Collection of New York Public Library.\\"A Note on the text\\" in a 1989 edition of the book, Chatto & Windus, London Citations Evelyn Waugh mentions the book in his novel A Handful of Dust as part of the childhood reading of his hero Tony Last. The critic Edmund Wilson referred to the novel This Side of Paradise by his friend F. Scott Fitzgerald as \\"a classic in a class with The Young Visiters\\", meaning that Fitzgerald's book had a rather naive style.Mizener, Arthur (1965). The Far Side of Paradise: A Biography of F.

The character was played by Yaphet Kotto. He is based on Baltimore Police Department Shift Lieutenant Gary D'Addario, a member of the BPD homicide unit described in David Simon's book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets which served as the inspiration for the series as a whole. The character also appeared in the Law & Order episode \\"Baby, It's You\\". Biography Al Giardello ‚Äì nicknamed \\"Gee\\" after the only thing he could say when called to his first murder scene as a rookie as well as a reference to his last name ‚Äì is the commander of the Homicide unit shift followed by the series. Holding the rank of lieutenant, he encounters a number of opportunities for promotion during the series, only to have his hopes dashed by the political maneuvering of his superiors. At the end of the seventh season, Giardello is offered a promotion to Captain but turns it down, since the position would require him to transfer out of the homicide unit. He is introduced early in the series as a widower of mixed Sicilian American and African American heritage. He originates from Southeast Baltimore, where his father was from Baltimore's Little Italy and his mother was from a neighboring housing project known as the Perkins Homes. He played three sports and was Prom King when he was in high school. He takes a degree of pride in both heritages, speaking near fluent Italian and fraternizing with many of the BPD's African American and Italian American officers alike. According to the episodes \\"Black and Blue\\" and \\"Narcissus\\", he began his career in the department in 1968. Gee enjoys cooking and is an excellent Hearts player, as revealed in the episode \\"All Through the House\\". As Bayliss tries (and fails) to hustle him out of some easy cash during a slow night, he learns from Munch that Gee put one of his three children through college by playing Hearts for money. In the Season 6 episode \\"Lies and Other Truths\\", it is revealed that Gee has kept in touch with a former KGB agent who apparently held him captive at some earlier point in his life. The agent tried to brainwash Gee for four months, without success, and Gee eventually persuaded him to defect to the West with the help of a $300,000 bribe. A physically imposing, highly articulate man, Giardello's cultural attitude stands in sharp contrast to both his Baltimore upbringing and many other officers in the Department. Despite his authoritative nature, Gee is essentially a humorous, good-natured man who seems to see himself as a mentor and father figure to his detectives, who are tremendously loyal to him. He also has a particular fondness for children, manifesting itself in marked outrage whenever children are murdered, an attribute shared by many other detectives. Family Gee is introduced as a widower whose wife has been dead for at least seven years prior to the first season. According to the Season 7 premiere \\"La Famiglia\\", he has three children: two daughters, Teresa and Charisse, and a son, Michael (whom Charisse refers to as Al Jr.). He has one grandchild, Al, who was born to Charisse in January 1999.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"A Case of Do or Die\\", originally aired February 12, 1999. He also expresses missing his late wife in several episodes of the first four seasons as well as his devoted, if on occasion strained, relationship with his children. In Season 4, Gee delays his flight out of Baltimore for a daughter's wedding for so long that by the time he does get to BWI, the weather has made it impossible for him to fly to the event in San Francisco, and he is left devastated. In \\"La Famiglia,\\" Mike - an FBI agent - comes to Baltimore from Arizona to assist in the investigation of three murders in Little Italy. One of the victims is Gee's cousin Mario, whom Mike remembers fondly from his childhood and who was killed as a result of his decision to testify against a union boss 25 years earlier. Mike ultimately resigns from the FBI and joins the Baltimore Police Department in order to be closer to his father. In the series finale \\"Forgive Us Our Trespasses,\\" Teresa and Mike attend Gee's promotion ceremony. His paternal grandmother, Rosina Giardello (whom he called \\"Nonna\\"), was still alive at the time of his death in 2000. As commander Gee is generally supportive of his detectives and usually places their success or welfare over the desires of those above him. An early example of this concerned his discovery that his superiors were hiding the fact they were removing asbestos from the squad building. When someone under his command gets too far out of line, though, he can take them to task very sharply, at one point even forcing Bayliss to apologize to \\"the bosses\\" for making an angry phone call to them over a case. Curiously, at his most annoyed or angry, Gee expresses a kind of whimsical and \\"bubbly\\" attitude, but one that comes with threats or hints of menace. He is only rarely given to physical outbursts of rage, such as sweeping everything off his desk or attacking a storage cabinet with a baseball bat. Gee is also in many respects \\"old school\\"; at times he expresses nostalgia for the Baltimore of his youth. Although he is critical of the abuses he endured in his early days on the police force, he expresses a grudging respect for what he feels the harder approach accomplished, including the fact that in the old days, cop-killers would not survive to face juries and trials. Giardello also possesses an intense belief in loyalty among fellow police officers as a \\"brotherhood\\"; in the episode \\"Black and Blue\\", he disagreed with Detective Frank Pembleton's suspicion that a cop had committed a shooting, and implied that loyalty to other cops is above loyalty to the citizenry, including the African-American citizenry. This was relevant, as the shooting occurred in a mostly black neighborhood and had become a racially charged issue. However, Gee's commitment to the truth above all was proven here: after Det. Pembleton's interrogation led a man they both knew was innocent to confess to the shooting, he told his detective to carry on with the case, and this led to the arrest of a police officer. Giardello tends to allow his detectives to investigate murders in a manner that is more efficient but less discreet, very much unlike the preferred methods instructed by the department's upper command. Gee's command style allows for cases to be cleared and allows his subordinates a form of investigative freedom which may result in more negative press for the department than what the upper command wishes for. Gee's leadership style and earned respect from his detectives mirrored the real-life dynamic with Lt. Gary D'Addario, who had a recurring role on the show as SWAT team commander Lt. Jasper. Relationship with bosses Much of Gee's time is spent fighting against \\"the bosses,\\" which is a strong factor in his initial failures at advancement. Giardello is considered a renegade commander and a thorn in the bosses' side due to his tendency to alert the media about investigations and allow his officers to investigate in a way that, while effective, is not representative of the department's political objectives. Early in the series, Giardello finds conflict with George Barnfather, a college-educated bureaucrat who is less experienced on the street and more interested in appeasing those who outrank him. Giardello is particularly incensed when Barnfather refuses to grant Steve Crosetti an honor guard because his suicide would create bad publicity for the department. Despite their differing objectives, Barnfather eventually grows to work with and even respect Giardello following the African Revival Movement fallout. After Giardello finds that a department colonel has been stealing money from the department and forces him to resign, Barnfather is promoted and offers Giardello his support when he needs it. Giardello finds most of his trouble throughout the department, however, with Deputy Commissioner James C. Harris. At one point in Giardello's career, Harris proved to be a useful ally whom Gee could turn to; that relationship, however, deteriorates with Gee's growing acts of command-oriented rebellion. Harris had asked Detective Frank Pembleton to cover up a scandal involving congressman Jeremy Wade, which nonetheless resulted in a lost election. Despite having ordered Pembleton to leave him out of the cover up, Harris believed Giardello could have done more to protect the Congressman in the aftermath. To punish Gee, Harris purposefully promotes an incompetent and bigoted officer named Roger Gaffney to a captain's position that Gee had earned and expected. As Gaffney is a \\"fat Irish ass\\" very much like Gee's racist training partner Mickey Shea, Harris sends Gee a reminder that his days in the BPD will be subject to dealing with contempt from the department's upper command. Gee, however, gets the last word on Harris after the fallout with the African Revival Movement, in which Harris' one-time partner Burundi Robinson provides Gee with incriminating information regarding Harris and a drug case where a large amount of heroin went missing: Harris stole the drugs and sold them to a dealer, and when Robinson protested they decided to flip a coin, with the loser resigning and the winner burying the story. After Robinson's suicide, Gee leaks this information to the press, and Harris is forced to resign in disgrace, with the ever-pleasant Gaffney pretending that he's upset about Harris' \\"long and distinguished career\\" being ruined because he wants to anger Gee. Nevertheless, Gaffney thinks better of antagonizing Gee after this incident. Experiences with racism According to Gee's childhood associate Felix Wilson, there were few Black policemen in Baltimore when they were growing up. Giardello joined the BPD in 1968 during a racially turbulent era and was subject to working under a predominantly White department in a largely African American city. One of Gee's first experiences on the force dealt with the Baltimore riot of 1968, which occurred in response to the assassination of African American leader Martin Luther King Jr. Gee described the event to Detective Frank Pembleton as a test of his loyalty, in which Gee was forced to determine if he would side with his community or his department. Gee experienced racism first-hand at the orders of his training officer Mickey Shea, an Irish officer who had forced a young Giardello to ride in the back of the patrol car. Shea told Gee that he \\"wouldn't share the front seat of his car with a nigger,\\" intentionally trying to provoke Gee into assaulting him so that he could be brought up on charges and thereby kicked off the force. Gee had also found conflict by other African Americans both professionally and socially. Within the BPD, Gee is repeatedly passed over for promotion to captain by African American commanders Deputy Commissioner James Harris and Colonel George Barnfather for White officers Megan Russert and Roger Gaffney, both of whom are less experienced and less competent. Gaffney is specifically promoted over Gee as punishment from Deputy Commissioner Harris due to Gaffney's racist attitude, large frame, and Irish background that resembled Shea. Off the job, Gee claims that African American women have discriminated against him romantically on the basis of his appearance being \\"too black\\" (It is also noteworthy that Gee's African American supervisors are of a much lighter complexion than him and may hence practice similar discrimination). It is stated by his son Michael that Gee was one of the department's first Black Lieutenants and that the police department had a long history of hatred towards Baltimore's Black community. Michael says he was the first black lieutenant, but Gee is ranked by Black officers such as Deputy Com. Harris and Col. Barnfather. Normally this would indicate that they both made lieutenant before him, but given Giardello's known predilection of being impolitic with the brass (including being a known leak to the press to put media pressure on the department) and Harris and Barnfather being known political animals that would play ball with their superiors, it is of strong consideration that Giardello was passed over for Captain by both for that reason and not strictly racism by either whites or lighter skinned blacks. Barnfather's youth is another indicator that Giardello was passed over by the Bosses for not cooperating in a political manner. Despite the various racial setbacks, Gee nevertheless advances in the department, managing to find camaraderie amongst many of the department's officers while maintaining a supportive attitude of Baltimore's majority African American community. Near the end of the final season, Giardello is finally offered the Captaincy and he tentatively accepts. However, upon reflection he realizes that he would miss being a shift commander - overseeing cases and giving advice and direction to his detectives. As his promotion would result in him leaving Homicide, he simply doesn't show up for his promotion ceremony. The Movie In Homicide: The Movie, Gee has left the department and is running for mayor on a platform in favor of drug legalization, with a considerable lead in the polls. The events of the film lead to an attempt on his life, which in turn prompts all of his living former detectives to come together and find the shooter. He is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery, during which he is shot again and one of the doctors operating on him is also wounded.

This can result in uneven hoof wear, which is incredibly painful for the affected horse. If the leg joints are not set properly, there is a high chance that the back joints are also set incorrectly, resulting in a poorly conformed horse. Horses with sickle-hocks are at an increased risk of developing thoroughpin, curb and bog or bone spavins. Very severe cases of sickle-hocks can result in permanent lameness and may require euthanization to prevent further pain. However, many horses with sickle-hock are not affected to this degree, and may live a life with uneven wearing hooves. Corrective shoeing can help the horse's balance and strength. Horses with sickle-hocks should be monitored closely for signs of lameness, and if possible a veterinarian should be consulted before extensive exercise. In cases of breeding, it is generally considered unwise to continue breeding a mare or stallion with sickle-hocks, as the trait is often passed to the offspring. Other animals who have this condition include, but are not limited to, cattle, sheep, and other types of livestock.

She has held numerous leadership roles on Academic boards and public policy councils, and she has authored many publications in the social studies of science and technology.  Early life  Nowotny grew up in Vienna, Austria during World War II. In interviews, she has recalled first wanting to become a scientist at the age of 8, when she was sent to Vorarlberg, the westernmost province of Austria, and quickly learned the local dialect. Nowotny received her doctorate of jurisprudence at the University of Vienna in 1959. After completing her degree, she faced opposition to her application for an assistant professorship in the Department of Criminology there on the basis of her being a woman. She agreed with the hiring professor that if a more capable man applied for the position, he could have the job. In the end, she was hired to the position. It was there that she became interested in the sociology of science. In 1965, she moved to New York City with her husband, where she enrolled in a sociology doctoral program. There, she met Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton, who mentored her throughout her education. In 1969, Nowotny earned her Ph.D. in sociology at Columbia University, New York, where she completed her thesis on macrosociology and its methodology. She returned to Vienna to work as an associate professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies. Research and publications Nowotny's work in the 1970s and 1980s includes topics such as scientific controversies and technological risks, social time, coping with uncertainty, self-organization in science and gender relations in science, resulting in major monographs, co-edited and edited books and numerous articles. In 1989, she published the book Eigenzeit (English title: Time: The Modern and Postmodern Experience), which has since been translated into several languages. Between 1992 and 1995 Helga Nowotny has been President of the International Society for the Study of Time. From the 1990s onwards she focused her research activities on new topics in social studies of science and technology. She conducted an empirical study on the discovery of high-superconductivity research and its impact on research policy (with Ulrike Felt) and increasingly on the changing relationship between science and society. In 1994 Nowotny helped coin the term ‚ÄúMode 2‚Äù for a new mode of applied research focused on solving specific problems. By contrast, ‚ÄúMode 1‚Äù is basic research done within disciplines, initiated by the interest of the investigator, not from external demand. Research policy Nowotny at a public speaking event in December 2015. Next to her teaching and research activities, carried out at several universities and research institutions in Europe, Nowotny had always been intensely engaged in research policy. From 1985-1992 she was Chair of the Standing Committee for the Social Sciences of the European Science Foundation. She has been chair and member of the scientific advisory boards of numerous research institutions and policy- related committees throughout Europe. From 2001 until early 2006 she was Chair of EURAB, the European Research Advisory Board of the European Commission. Nowotny is one of the founding members of the European Research Council, which has been established to fund frontier research at EU level based on the sole criteria of scientific excellence and pan-European competition. There she served as the Vice President and in February 2010, Nowotny was unanimously elected to the position of President of the European Research Council after the resignation of the founding president, Fotis Kafatos. As president of the ERC, she promoted increases in research funding across Europe, and advised new EU member states to increase funding support for their own research programs to prevent a \\"brain drain\\". She held the position until December 2013. In 2014, Nowotny was appointed chair of the ERA Council Forum Austria, which advises the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research at the interface of European and national research policy. Currently, Nowotny is Chair of the International Advisory Board of the University of Vienna. In 2020, she was appointed by European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel to chair an independent search committee for the next president of the ERC.Commission appoints independent Search Committee and invites nominations and applications to fill the post of the next President of the European Research Council European Commission, press release of October 9, 2020.  Professional positions  In 1981-1982 and 2003-2004 Nowotny was a Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin and from 1992-1999 Permanent Fellow at Collegium Budapest/Institute of Advanced Study. Before moving to ETH Zurich, she was Professor and Head of the newly founded Institute for Theory and Social Studies of Science of the University of Vienna. From 1998 on, Nowotny was Director of the Collegium Helveticum at ETH Zurich. She was the founding director of the post-graduate fellowship programme based at ETH ‚ÄúSociety in science: the Branco Weiss Fellowship‚Äù until 2004, when she returned to her native Vienna. From 2008 to 2014, Nowotny was a member of the Holberg Committee, which awards the Holberg prize to scholars who have made outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law or theology.

Description Location of the hock An animal is cow- hocked when its hock is set inward, resulting in a splayed look in the back legs. This can result in the uneven wearing of hooves, which can end up in permanent lameness, and can prove to be a very serious condition. Permanent lameness usually results in the animal going for meat, as the cow will be in far too much pain to move, the milk in a cow will not be up to standard, and the animal could not be used in breeding, as this trait would pass on. However, most animals will not have too serious a condition, and will walk with a splayed-leg look. Another way of spotting cow-hock is when the hooves point outward as a result of the incorrect lineup of the joints in the leg. Another problem with cow-hocks is when the joints in the leg are not set correctly, the joints in the back will most likely be set incorrectly as well. The animal will not do well in agricultural shows, will be in a lot of pain, and for both of these reasons, it is advised to take the animal out of any breeding programs. Effects In cow-hocked horses, the hind hocks are too close together and point toward each other, with the feet too widely apart. It is a fairly common defect, and if the metatarsal bones are vertical, may not always cause lameness. A combination of cow- and sickle-hocks poses a greater risk.Adams and Stashak's Lameness in Horses, edited by Gary M. Baxter (Wiley- Blackwell, 2011, 6th ed.), n.p. Cats are commonly cow-hocked, with the hind legs angling inward at the knee and the feet splaying outward more than forward. Mild cow-hocking is negligible, and kittens often look a little cow- hocked, but if the defect is severe, the resulting poor alignment can damage the joints and spine.The Cat Breeders Handbook (TIBCC, 2009), p. 26. A similar deviation may occur in the vertical alignment of a dog's rear structure.Linda P. Case, The Dog: Its Behavior, Nutrition, and Health (Blackwell, 2005, 2nd ed.), p. 47.

According to its proprietors, it is the oldest continuously operating saloon in California. It remains a popular tourist stop on the main road between The Bay Area and Yosemite.  History  James Tannahill was the first owner of the Granite Store, built of granite, that would later become the Iron Door Saloon. It was built before 1852 in Big Oak Flat, which was renamed Groveland in 1863 when James Tannahill became its first postmaster, and the store its first post office. It first became a saloon, called \\"Jake's Place\\", in 1896 when it was purchased by Giacomo DeFarrari. The building was renamed \\"The Iron Door Saloon\\" in 1937, after iron doors, hauled in by mules, were installed. The building was remodeled at that time to add a second story where cards, billiards, and pool were offered for diversion. The doors were meant to aid in fire prevention in case neighboring buildings caught fire. The interior has the typical decor of an old saloon, with the original bar intact. The ceiling is adorned with dollar bills and historical artifacts. Live music is offered on the weekends.

The book is available as a single hardcover volume or a series of four paperback volumes. The text describes Bruce Lee's Kung Fu fighting techniques, philosophy and training methods. This book was originally written in 1966 by Bruce Lee. However, Lee decided not to publish this work as he feared that instructors would use the fighting knowledge in this text to promote themselves. In 1978, after Bruce Lee's death, his widow Linda Lee Cadwell decided to make available the information on her husband's work. Lee's death changed the perspective of releasing the information that Bruce Lee himself had vacillated about. The book was published with the help of Mitoshi Uyehara. Uyehara was the founder and owner of Black Belt Magazine. During the early years of the publication, Uyehara served as the publisher. Bruce Lee contributed many articles to the publication during the 1960s and a friendship ensued between the two men. Uyehara, a martial artist in his own right, was a key personage in arranging Lee's material for publication.

Founded in 1987, the Academy has over 750 Fellows. The Academy's 35-year history has been published on their website.  History  The Academy held its founding meeting on 20 May in 1987 in Montr√©al. The honour of being the first member of the Academy was accorded to 98-year-old retired engineer and EIC past president, John Stirling. Robert Legget was elected the founding president of the Academy, with Philip Lapp as president-elect, Larkin Kerwin as vice-president, and L√©opold Nadeau as secretary-treasurer. In September 1991 the Canadian Academy of Engineering formally joined the International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences (CAETS), the currently 26-member independent, non- political international forum for the discussion and communication of engineering issues. In 2000, Micheline Bouchard was elected the first woman president of the CAE. The second, in 2005, was Kathleen Sendall, and the third was Kim Sturgess in 2011.  Membership  The 44 founding Fellows of the Academy included 12 Fellows from academia and 32 from industrial, government and non-profit organizations. Around a quarter of them were francophone. Fellows have been inducted into the Academy on the basis of having had careers, given services and made contributions to engineering, the profession and society that surpassed what would normally be considered a successful career in the candidate's field. Election has always been through nomination by existing members, verification by Committee, and voting by the membership. There has also been an underlying obligation that inductees be prepared to contribute to the life and work of the Academy. The first woman to be inducted into the Academy, in 1988, was Danielle Zaikoff. Awards The Academy announced in 2017 that, partnered with SAE Foundation Canada, it had established two annual student awards aimed at recognizing the importance of aerospace, automotive and transport design engineering. One, the CAE Bruce Aubin SAE Aerospace Design Award, valued at $800, and the other the CAE William G.

The character is loosely based on Baltimore detective Donald Waltemeyer and appeared in the series for its entire run. Lewis had the very first and last lines of the series. Born on September 10, 1962, Lewis was raised in Baltimore's Lafayette Court housing project. In 1996, he watched its demolition and kept a brick from the rubble as a memento.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"Full Moon\\", originally aired April 5, 1996. He attended Lake Clifton High School from 1976 to 1980.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"The Damage Done\\", originally aired May 3, 1996. It is indicated he was raised Baptist, but his wedding was performed by a member of the Universal Life Church. Lewis joined the homicide unit in April 1990.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"Justice, Part 2\\", originally aired February 23, 1996. His first partner in the series was Steve Crosetti, who occasionally irritated him with his arcane historical interests and demeanor. The two usually got along well, however, so Crosetti's later suicide deeply unnerved Lewis. At first he refused to even believe it could be a suicide, reasoning that Crosetti, a devout Catholic and devoted father, would never violate his faith and abandon his child. In time he accepted Crosetti's suicide but still felt a certain dismay that he had never known Crosetti was \\"in that kind of pain\\" and apparently felt he could not tell Lewis about his problems. Stan Bolander comforted Lewis by saying that in giving up his prized vintage yo-yo as a gift to Lewis, Crosetti was in his own way saying goodbye. Lewis remained without a partner for a time until partnering with Mike Kellerman, who transferred into Homicide from the arson unit at the start of Season 4. This partnership initially worked reasonably well, but had some strains as Kellerman slid toward alcoholism and humiliation when he was falsely accused of having taken bribes while in his previous position. As Kellerman kept his problems less secret than Crosetti, Lewis was able to stop a potential suicide attempt. Lewis and Kellerman had earlier found themselves arguing with each other over a Nation of Islam group acting as a private security force in a Baltimore City housing project. During a homicide investigation, the Muslims baited Kellerman with racial remarks, and it did not help when Lewis agreed with the Muslims' presence in the projects as because of them, there were fewer homicides in the projects. Lewis nonetheless forced the Muslims' leader to answer both him and Kellerman (the leader would only speak to Black homicide detectives about the identity of a murder suspect) during an attempt at turning the two against each other. When Kellerman and Lewis were finally able to snare drug kingpin Luther Mahoney for drug trafficking and murder, Lewis beat up Mahoney until he grabbed Lewis' gun. However, Kellerman and Terri Stivers showed up in time to prevent Mahoney from killing Lewis, and Kellerman shot and killed Mahoney during an ambiguous standoff. Although Lewis initially approved of Kellerman's actions, he later decided they could no longer be partners. During Season 6, Lewis got into an altercation with Mahoney's sister Georgia Rae and was suspended. He persuaded fellow detective Paul Falsone to feed him information about the organization, which he used to start an internal war that eventually led to a bloodbath for both the police and the criminals. Kellerman finally admitted the truth about the Mahoney shooting - that the man had not been pointing Lewis' weapon at anyone when Kellerman shot him - and resigned in order to keep Lewis and Stivers from losing their jobs. Kellerman then asked to borrow Lewis' gun so he could commit suicide, but Lewis refused to give it to him. In Season 7, Lewis developed problems with his new partner, Rene Sheppard, when she suffered a brutal beating and had her gun taken from her by a suspect, who shot at Lewis and nearly killed him (the bullet nicked the crown of his trademark hat). Lewis refused to partner with any of the female detectives in the unit until the final episode, in which he and Sheppard achieved a reconciliation of sorts and began to work a crime scene together. According to the Season 4 episode \\"I've Got a Secret,\\" Lewis had a mentally ill brother named Anthony, who was institutionalized roughly 20 years earlier as he was a danger to himself and others. Lewis confessed to Kellerman that he did not intervene on one of Anthony's suicide attempts, and even briefly hoped it might succeed as it would end Anthony's suffering and the hardships he put on the rest of the family. Lewis estimated that he last visited Anthony in 1978; he tried to do so again during this episode, but Anthony refused to see him. Lewis had a harshly realistic view of the job, and was openly critical of Tim Bayliss for putting so much of his emotional energy into the unforgiving field of police work. In 1996, Lewis married Barbara Shivers on extremely short notice. The couple eventually split up. Those who knew Lewis were unsurprised at the breakup; in fact, up to the moment of the wedding many of his co- workers (particularly John Munch) assumed the engagement was a hoax.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"The Wedding\\", originally aired May 10, 1996. In October 2013, Lewis attended a roast for Munch in New York City following his retirement from the NYPD. Lewis jokingly told the audience that \\"we [Munch's former colleagues] ran his butt outta B-more.\\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Wonderland Story\\", originally aired October 16, 2013.

When an animal is post-legged, the leg joints are far too straight, with almost no bend in the legs. Four-legged animals must have some bend in the hocks, otherwise the hooves would wear unevenly, and this may result in lameness, or at least a rougher gait. The animal will not stand squarely on the ground, and this also increases the possibility of injury to the animal. When an animal is post-legged, the animal will have a much higher risk of lameness, perhaps even permanent. This means the animal can hardly move at all, and results in an extremely stressed animal. This may also result in the animal not being able to move to food, and could be life-threatening. Also, since the animal is in such pain, it may be so stressed that it won't calve well, and it will not produce good quality milk, -or any milk at all- in a cow. Animals with a problem in their leg joints are recommended to be removed from the breeding line, as this condition will only pass on, and cause much pain and suffering to the young of this species. Also, animals with an incorrect joint placement such as this will not do well in the ring at agricultural shows. This condition may affect cattle, horses, sheep, and many other livestock animals.

The nearest town to Dedham is the small market town of Manningtree. Governance Dedham is part of the electoral ward called Dedham and Langham. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 2,943. Geography Dedham is frequently rated as containing some of England's most beautiful Lowland landscape, most particularly the water meadows of the River Stour, which passes along the northern boundary of the village forming the boundary between Essex and Suffolk. Dedham has a central nuclear settlement around the Church and the junction of Mill Lane and the High Street (part of the B1029). Connected to Dedham are the hamlets of The Heath and Lamb Corner. The village forms a key part of the Dedham Vale. History Early documents record the name as Diddsham, presumably for a family known as Did or Didd. Smith cites Gerald Henry Rendall. =Dedham Classis= In 1582‚Äì1587, a schismatic Presbyterian Christian group called the Dedham Classis, which included dozens of members opposed to the established church, was active in north-east Essex.Goose, N. and Cooper, J. (1998) Tudor and Stuart Colchester. Published by Victoria County History of Essex. () This group held clandestine meetings and prayer groups in and around Colchester and surrounding villages like Dedham, publishing and distributing versions of Wycliffe's Bible and various other Calvinist texts obtained from London; the Dedham Classis is the best recorded of those active in the sixteenth century.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol9/pp121-132 retrieved 26 April 2015 =Dedham Settlers in the Massachusetts Bay Colony= A group of early dissenters left Dedham to found the township of Dedham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635. Under the leadership of John Rogers, a preacher banned from his work in England, they established a settlement on the western edge of the colony first established in 1628, now a suburb of the city of Boston. Despite some early setbacks this township eventually proved very successful and a number of prominent US families can trace their ancestry from these early arrivals from East Anglia ‚Äì see note below on William Tecumseh Sherman. John Constable John Constable, Dedham Vale (1802) Dedham is at the heart of 'Constable Country' ‚Äì the area of England where Constable lived and painted. Constable attended the town's Grammar School (now the 'Old Grammar School' and 'Well House'), and he would walk to school each morning alongside the River Stour from his family's home in East Bergholt. Many of Constable's paintings feature Dedham, including Dedham Mill, which his father owned, and Dedham Parish Church, whose massive Caen stone and flint tower is a focal point of the surrounding Dedham Vale. =Other artists= In 1937, Cedric Morris and Arthur Lett-Haines founded the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing at Dedham. When, however, this burnt down, they moved to Hadleigh, Suffolk. Of longer influence in Dedham was the horse painter Sir Alfred Munnings, who became President of the Royal Academy. His house in Dedham, Castle House, now contains a gallery of his work, and his studio. Tom Keating, the art restorer and famous art forger, was a Dedham resident until his death in 1984. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church. Architecture Dedham contains a number of well-preserved buildings: *Dedham Parish Church ‚Äì St. Mary the Virgin, Dedham; the present building dates from the late 15th century, and was the last medieval 'wool church' to be completed, albeit in a more economical style that was originally intended. The Ascension by John Constable is on permanent display in the church. A viewing platform on top of the tower (open to the public from Easter to Harvest) gives excellent views of the lower part of the Stour valley. *Sherman's Hall, a Grade I listed, Georgian-fronted townhouse used as a school until 1873 and now belonging to the National Trust. *The Old Grammar School, founded by Elizabeth I. The present building dates from 1732 and was attended by John Constable. It is now private residences. *The Sun Inn, a medieval building that retains its coaching arch. *A Congregational church built in 1739 is now the Dedham Art and Craft Centre. * Southfields, Grade I listed, is the most splendid of the many medieval buildings in the village. Formerly a factory used when Dedham was a wealthy wool town it is now a series of cottages. *Castle House, the home of Sir Alfred Munnings and now the Sir Alfred Munnings Art Museum. *Assembly Rooms, The external appearance of the building suggests it is a Victorian building in the classical style, but research carried out as part of refurbishment works in 1998-9 has confirmed that the structure is much older, dating from c.1745. Although it was known as the 'Hewitt Memorial Hall' from 1917‚Äì1997 (in memory of the brother of a local benefactor, William Wilkins Hewitt), it has since reverted to its earlier name. Economy Formerly a rich wool town and market town, Dedham is a flourishing commercial village, with a post office, butcher, Co-op, grocer, delicatessen, cafe, tea rooms, art shop and various other shops. (Registration required) Agriculture is also important with mainly arable land (sugar beet and wheat) but also cattle grazing on the water meadows and some sheep on Grove Hill. There is an industrial estate near the A12 road, a main route passing the west of the village. A business centre and nursing home have recently opened. Local amenities *Boat Hire *Tennis Club ‚Äì Dedham has a tennis club with three all-weather courts and a club house *Cricket Club ‚Äì Dedham's cricket club is on the Duchy Field directly south of the church. It has its own pavilion. *Football Club ‚Äì Dedham Old Boys Football Club, founded in 1877, plays its home matches on the Recreation Field to the south of the church. *Dedham Junior Football Club is a Charter Standard club *Dedham has an atypically large number of restaurants and hotels for an English village. The Maison Talbooth which is an historic house provides both accommodation and restaurant services *Dedham Primary School - an Ofsted-rated \\"Outstanding\\" primary school located in Parsons Field, 5 minutes walk from the village centre, offering single form entry, from Reception class to Year 6. Transport Manningtree can easily be accessed by bicycle or by walking along the banks of the River Stour. Manningtree railway station provides regular, fast commuter services to London and Norwich. Colchester can be reached by bus, with the no.81 looping through the village and serving Langham, Myland and Colchester North Station (mainline station) on its way to Colchester town centre. School buses service all the schools in Colchester and the independent schools in Ipswich.

This game was announced at the 2006 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany as the sequel to Super Mario Strikers for the GameCube. It was released on May 25, 2007 in Europe, June 7, 2007 in Australia, July 30, 2007 in North America and September 20, 2007 in Japan. The game supported the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, through which players can participate in online matches and tournaments. Upon its European release, it became the first Wii online game to be available outside Japan. It was also the second Mario game released on the Wii after Super Paper Mario and the first Mario game to be given a rating higher than E by the ESRB. Gameplay A match between Mario and Wario with the score tied. The gameplay of Mario Strikers Charged is similar to that of the original game, with characters fighting for possession of a metallic ball played on several pitches. As well as differing aesthetically, most pitches feature physical elements that affect play; players must use precision and accurate timing to overcome them. The most powerful shot possible is the \\"Mega Strike\\", which only the captain can perform and accounts for a varying number of points ranging from three to six. In addition, sidekicks are able to perform a special shot‚Äîknown as a \\"Skillshot\\"‚Äîthat occurs if sufficiently charged and results in the character releasing a shot that is either able to paralyze or bypass the goalkeeper. Defensively, characters not in possession can hit others with or without the ball, although doing so to others without it will give the opposing team an item. The power-up system returns from other Mario sports titles. The player can use these items‚Äîred shells, bananas, etc.‚Äîto impede the opponent and gain an advantage. Some power-ups aid the player by immobilising and hindering the opponent, while others grant temporary invulnerability and allow the user to score a goal more easily. A \\"Super Ability\\" item has been implemented into the game, which only the captain can use and grants unique abilities; notably, some like Mario and Luigi will grow to immense size, while others such as Donkey Kong will impede other characters in a large radius. Strikers features multiple gameplay modes, such as the \\"Domination Mode,\\" in which the player faces an opponent of the player's choosing. They can also adjust match settings to limit or expand the match time or number of goals which are necessary for victory. The player can also play through \\"Striker Challenges\\", where they select a session with certain obstructions, such as missing characters or a susceptible goalkeeper. If they are successful in passing, they are given further adjustments called \\"cheats\\", that can render shooting easier and turn off physical elements of the fields in the game. Training sessions appear in the form of \\"Strikers 101,\\" where the player can practice individual aspects such as shooting and tackling. \\"Road to the Striker Cup\\" allows the player to compete in matches against the computer to gain rewards. The player can also partake in online matches with others around the world. =Characters= There are a total of twelve captains and eight sidekicks to choose from to form a five-player team, which consists of a captain, three sidekicks, and a goalie. All characters, except for the goalies, are separated into five categories: Balanced (balanced in all areas), Playmaker (speedy with good passing ability), Power (good shooting and defensive ability), Offensive (good shooting and passing ability), and Defensive (speedy with good defensive ability). A team may consist of any combination of different sidekicks (e.g. two Koopa Troopas and a Shy Guy). Kritters appear as goalies and can be controlled to stop the opponent's Mega Strike. Game modes =Road to the Strikers Cup= Road to the Strikers Cup is a standard-set tournament. It is a mode for 1-4 players. The players are challenged by CPU teams along the three cups: The Fire Cup, the Crystal Cup, and the Striker Cup. The gameplay gets difficult as the players progress through the cups. Extreme Mode is added in this game, and makes the game very difficult from the start. Unlike other Mario sports games, players must restart the cup from the beginning when they lose in the elimination round, rather than being given the option to replay the match that they lost in. =Domination Mode= This mode allows players to split into two teams. Up to four players can play, and the players can play 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 1 vs. 2, and 1 vs. 3 matches. The players can also cooperate against a CPU player. =Striker Challenges= This mode is for one player only. Every character has one challenge, amounting to 12 challenges in total. A lot of challenges require the player to win such as the goalie not being able to catch the ball because of being weak to charged shots, or the opposing team leading by 5 points by the start of the match. The challenges are separated by difficulty and get more difficult as the player progresses. =Nintendo WFC Mode= Players can access the Internet to play with friends online in their region. Matches are available for any combination of four players on two teams as long as at least one player controls each team. Points earned in ranked matches are determined on their position for \\"Striker of the Day\\". Players earn 10 points for winning a match, one point for each goal they score (up to a maximum of 10), and staying online and losing gives them one point. However, if the player disconnects, they will lose points. In this mode, any captain is selectable, no matter if they are unlocked or not. Reception Like its predecessor, the game received generally positive reviews from critics (\\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic). Still, the visual style, reminiscent of Kazuto Nakazawa was praised, as well as the multiplayer and improvements. However, some had little praise for its single-player offerings and noted shallow gameplay. Official Nintendo Magazine praised the pick-up and play feel of the game, giving the game a 91%. Hypers Rico Shavez commended the game for its \\"great net code and immediately fun\\". However, he criticised it for its \\"lack of options, being shallow and its lightweight single player\\". As of March 31, 2008, 1.77 million copies of the game have been sold worldwide, with 240,000 being sold in Japan. It received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

It is known for its unusual coloration, which consists of shades from green to turquoise, topped with dark, transverse dorsal banding. This coloration helps camouflage it in its arboreal habitat. Its colour also makes the emerald tree monitor highly prized in both the pet trade and zoos alike. Names It is known as wbl km in the Kalam language of Papua New Guinea. Taxonomy Varanus prasinus was first described as Monitor viridis by John Edward Gray in 1831; however, Gray's original holotype (RMNH 4812 in the National Natural History Museum in Leiden) was lost and the species was redescribed by Schlegel eight years later as V. prasinus using the found specimen. The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic word waral (Ÿàÿ±ŸÑ), which translates to English as \\"monitor\\". Its specific name, prasinus, is Latin for the color green. Varanus prasinus is a member of the subgenus Euprepiosaurus. It is closely related to several other arboreal species; when combined, these are often referred to as the V. prasinus species group or species complex. In addition to V. prasinus, this species group, whose members are all allopatric, includes V. beccarii (Aru Islands), V. boehmei (Waigeo Island), V. bogerti (D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago), V. keithhornei (Cape York Peninsula), V. kordensis (Biak Island), V. macraei (Batanta Island), V. reisingeri (Misool Island) and V. telenesetes (Rossel Island).Jacobs, H. J. (2003). A further new emerald tree monitor lizard of the Varanus prasinus species group from Waigeo, West Irian (Squamata: Sauria: Varanidae). Salamandra 39(2): 65-74 Evolutionary history The family Varanidae probably originated in Asia about 65 million years ago, although some estimates are as early as the late Mesozoic (112 million years ago). Monitor lizards probably migrated to Australia and the Indonesian archipelago between 39 and 26 million years ago. All members of the V. prasinus species group (sometimes referred to as subgenus Euprepiosaurus) are found east of Lydekker‚Äôs line in the Indo-Australian Archipelago. This group probably originated in the Moluccas, although dating their origins is complicated by the paucity of the fossil record. The absence of large placental predatory mammals east of Wallace's line may be partially responsible for the radiation of the V. prasinus group in the Australo-Papuan region. Distribution Emerald tree monitors and their close relatives can be found in New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea) as well as several adjacent islands, and the northern Torres Strait Islands. The green tree monitor is reported to thrive in lowland environments, including tropical evergreen forests, palm swamps and cocoa plantations. Description Emerald tree monitors at the Bristol Zoo The emerald tree monitor is about long with a slender body that helps it support itself on narrow branches. It uses its prehensile tail and long claws to grip branches. Unlike other varanids, this monitor defends its tail rather than lashing with it for defense when threatened. The soles of the feet of the emerald tree monitor have enlarged scales which aid the lizard when climbing. Ecology When threatened, the emerald tree monitor will flee through vegetation or bite if cornered. It is one of the few social monitors, living in small groups made up of a dominant male, several females, and a few other males and juveniles. Diet The emerald tree monitor's diet consists of large tree-dwelling arthropods, such as katydids, stick insects, cockroaches, beetles, centipedes, spiders and crabs, as well as birds and small mammals. Before swallowing stick insects, the lizards tear off the legs. Captive specimens tear off the limbs of rodents prior to eating them; as a result, they are capable of swallowing mammals of a considerable size: A 135-g lizard was documented as eating a 40-g rodent, almost one-third its size. Paleontologist and Temple University professor Michael Balsai has observed V. prasinus eating fruit (bananas) in captivity as has herpetologist and author Robert G. Sprackland. Reproduction Clutches consist of up to five eggs, each weighing and measuring about . As many as three clutches are laid throughout the year; clutches have been laid by captives in January, March, April, November, and December. The female emerald tree monitor lays her eggs in arboreal termite nests. The eggs hatch between 160 and 190 days later, typically from June to November, after which the young eat the termites and the termite's eggs within minutes of hatching. Sexual maturity is reached in about one year.

Controversy  Mount was arrested at Goodspeed's Book Shop in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 13, 1987, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for attempting to sell 158 Civil War documents to Claire Rochefort. These documents had been stolen from the National Archives and Records Administration. Mount was also in possession of additional letters stolen from both the Library of Congress and National Archives, in what is one of the largest rare documents thefts, with the value of the stolen items totalling over $100,000. Mount was initially charged with two counts of interstate transportation of stolen property, with the first count on the Whistler letters from the Library of Congress and the Churchill and James letters from the National Archives. The second count covered 144 of the 158 Civil War documents Mount was attempting to sell to Rochefort. Because of excellent record-keeping by both institutions, including call slips and microfilm versions of the documents, Mount was convicted on March 30, 1989, and was sentenced to eight years in prison.Galvin  Archives material  Smithsonian Archives of American Art Charles Merrill Mount papers relating to Gilbert Stuart, [ca. 1950‚Äì1960]  Bibliography  * Galvin, T.

This is the first film of the Kerberos saga. Plot It is the end of the 20th century. The Metropolitan Police have begun to lose control of Tokyo; crime is rampant and people are no longer safe. Their solution: the establishment of the Anti Vicious Crime Heavily Armored Mobile Special Investigations Unit. Created by men and women of high intellect and physical strength who had a particularly strong, even fanatical sense of justice, they were nicknamed \\"Kerberos\\", and armed with special body armor called \\"reinforcement gear\\" and heavy weaponry. What started as a noble and courageous effort to stop the onslaught of crime soon spiraled out of control. Their overzealous actions and fanatical hatred of evil soon led to less-than police-like behavior. Public criticism grew as their investigative tactics became more aggressive, cruel, and corrupt. The turning point occurred when a Kerberos member, during a routine investigation, beat a misdemeanor offender to death. This was the catalyst and justification to shut the group down forever and dissolve it completely. However, there were those in the Kerberos group who refused to disarm. Three of the elite rebelled against the system, and fought their way through the city. Two were wounded, and unable to escape capture. Only one‚Äîsenior detective, Koichi Todome, managed to escape, and he promised the others that he would return for them. Several years later, Koichi, a fugitive from the government, returns home for reasons that seem unclear. The city has decayed at an exponential rate and is completely unlike the place he left behind. Everything is surreal and strange, blurred and nondescript. He wanders, trying to find some semblance of his past and to find the comrades he'd left behind. But, the city itself seems to resist him, and there are those who realize the threat that Koichi poses, and his return is more dangerous than anyone realizes. In the end, it is revealed that most of Koichi's exploits in Japan are in fact a dying dream, as he is attacked and killed shortly after returning to Japan.

The Red Spectacles is probably Oshii's most literate feature work. Not only, dialogue and narrative parts are prominent over drama but the film contains a variety of philosophical concepts such as Free will and Determinism, mentioned through fables, like \\"The Magnet and the Iron Sands\\" and \\"The Ogre Saved by the Fisherman\\", or through classic poet-authors quotes, Shakespeare and Pushkin. The characters refers to European medieval tales and Greek mythology, such as oral versions of Little Red Riding Hood and the three-headed watchdog of Hell Cerberus. Releases On February 25, 2003, the DVD edition was made available in Japan as part of the Mamoru Oshii Cinema Trilogy anthology box set, which contained four DVDs and one soundtrack CD. On November 4 of the same year, a subtitled version of Akai megane was released in North America as both a single DVD and also as part of a US release of the box set. The US version of the trilogy box set has different box artwork and lacks the \\"Revisited Scene & Production\\" DVD of the Japanese version. The American The Red Spectacles DVD edition was reprinted in 2004, and since then is only available in the box set which was printed three times as of 2006 and remains the only edition released outside Japan. Related works The Red Spectacles is the first film of the Kerberos saga. Oshii would write a lengthy comic series expanding on the universe. While Waiting for the Red Spectacles (1987) is a radio drama prequel written by Kazunori It≈ç with an original soundtrack composed by Kenji Kawai. The film would be followed by two prequels: StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops (1991) and Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade (1999).

Biography  The sources are slim for his reign, less than ten inscriptions, a fragmentary chronicle and references to his affairs in those of his sonNassouhi list, iii 22‚Äì23: mdAdad-nƒÅrƒÅrƒ´ mƒÅr Arik2-Àπde-enÀ∫-[ili]. or perhaps brother,Khorsabad list, iii 16‚Äì24: mdAdad-nƒÅrƒÅrƒ´ a·∏´u-≈°√∫ ≈°a mArik2-dƒ´n2-ili.SDAS list, iii 17‚Äì18: mdAdad- nƒÅrƒÅrƒ´ a·∏´u-≈°√∫ ≈°a mArik2-dƒ´n2-ili. Adad-nirari I‚Äôs accounts. He seems to have been the first of the Assyrian kings to have institutionalized the conduct of annual military campaigns, some of which appear to be little more than livestock-rustling expeditions, as the chronicle mentions ‚Äúa hundred head of sheep and goats and a hundred head of their cattle [...] he brought to A≈°≈°ur.‚Äù Arik-den-ili‚Äôs first victories were against his eastern neighbours (the Pre- Iranic inhabitants of what was to become Persia), Turukku and Nigimhi, and all the chiefs of the (Zagros) mountains and highlands in the broad tracts of the Gutians to subdue the nomadic tribes on Assyria's northern and eastern frontiers. The Gutians had been vassals of the Kassites who ruled in Babylon and may have acted as their agents. Nigimhi‚Äôs ruler was Esini. The Assyrians had invaded and carried off their harvest and in retaliation Esini led a force into Assyria which resulted in a massacre of his forces. Arik-den-ili besieged the town of Arnuna, in which Esini was holed up. Destruction of the gate and walls forced Esini‚Äôs capitulation and so he swore allegiance to his Assyrian overlord. The chronicle then lists Habaruha, Kutila, Tarbi·π£u, Kudina, Remaku and Nagabbilhi. Of these only Tarbi·π£u is known, a town a short distance from Nineveh. The residents of Halahhu seem to have borne the brunt of his wrath as he claimed to have killed 254,000 of them, a fairly preposterous boast even for the period. He then turned westward into The Levant (modern Syria and Lebanon), where he subjugated the Suteans, the A·∏´lam√ª and the Yauru, the nomadic West Semitic tribesmen who would become the Arameans, in the region of Katmu·∏´i in the middle Euphrates. But his activities were not limited to warfare. The temple of ≈†ama≈° at A≈°≈°ur, as a mud-brick construction, had decayed into a mound of dirt surrounded by ad hoc shrines. ‚ÄúIn order that the harvest of my land might prosper,‚Äù he had them cleared and rebuilt the temple, laying its foundation during the eponym year of Berutu, a son of the earlier king Eriba-Adad I. His own son credited him with the construction of the great Ziggurat of A≈°≈°ur in one of his own building dedications. Like his father, Enlil-nirari, before him he had to battle inconclusively against Babylonia, in this case against king Nazi-Marutta≈°. His son was to recall ‚Äúmy father could not rectify the calamities inflicted by the army of the king of the Kassite land‚Äù in a contemporary Assyrian epic. That dispute was finally resolved with his son, Adad-nirari I's victory over the Babylonians.

The play was later the subject of numerous revisions. It was part of what the author called the \\"Cycle of the Absurd\\", with the novel The Stranger (1942) and the essay The Myth of Sisyphus (1942). A number of critics have reported the piece to be existentialist; however, Camus always denied belonging to this philosophy. Its plot revolves around the historical figure of Caligula, a Roman Emperor famed for his cruelty and seemingly insane behavior. About The play shows Caligula, Roman Emperor, torn by the death of Drusilla, his sister and lover. In Camus' version of events, Caligula eventually deliberately manipulates his own assassination. (Historically, this event took place January 24, AD 41.) Here is the theme of the play presented by the author himself (in the U.S. edition of Theater in 1957): \\"Caligula, a relatively kind prince so far, realizes on the death of Drusilla, his sister and his mistress, that \\"men die and they are not happy.\\" Therefore, obsessed by the quest for the Absolute and poisoned by contempt and horror, he tries to exercise, through murder and systematic perversion of all values, a freedom which he discovers in the end is no good. He rejects friendship and love, simple human solidarity, good and evil. He takes the word of those around him, he forces them to logic, he levels all around him by force of his refusal and by the rage of destruction which drives his passion for life. But if his truth is to rebel against fate, his error is to deny men. One cannot destroy without destroying oneself. This is why Caligula depopulates the world around him and, true to his logic, makes arrangements to arm those who will eventually kill him. Caligula is the story of a superior suicide. It is the story of the most human and the most tragic of errors. Unfaithful to man, loyal to himself, Caligula consents to die for having understood that no one can save himself all alone and that one cannot be free in opposition to other men.\\"  Versions of Caligula  The final version is the four-act version of 1944, first published jointly with The Misunderstanding then published alone in the same year. There is a three-act version of 1941, re-published in 1984, in the compilation Cahiers Albert Camus. The changes between the versions show the effect of World War II on Camus. The play is the basis for the 2006 German- language opera of the same name by Glanert.

When President Hosni Mubarak allowed the Wafd to emerge from a prolonged period of dormancy in 1984, Serageldin proved a skilful political operator given the limits imposed on a divided and decimated opposition, and made the Al-Wafd newspaper an instant success through its Asfoura (Sparrow) column expos√©s of corruption and mismanagement. A minister by his early thirties, he held four portfolios in the 1940s, serving in the Wafd-led Government of 1950-52 as Interior and Finance Minister. His political career was abruptly suspended as the Free Officers' coup neared. Put on trial, he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment but released two months later. Several periods of detention followed under Colonel Nasser. Serageldin did not return to the political landscape until 1978, when President Anwar Sadat, attempting to reinvigorate party pluralism, likened him to Louis XIV coming back from the grave. Political turbulence ensued, however, and Serageldin was one of a number to be imprisoned in 1981 in the twilight of Sadat's rule. The Wafd Party sprang from the delegation formed by the nationalist Saad Zaghloul in 1918 to demand complete independence from the British, and was officially founded a year later. Serageldin upheld the party's tradition for democracy, bisectarianism and liberalism, but in courting the Muslim Brotherhood was thought to have exceeded a remit to broaden its popular appeal. He would later take credit for ordering police in Ismailia armed with rifles to engage in a futile battle against British troops using light artillery, but this merely precipitated the burning of Cairo a day later on 26 January 1952, and the Government's immediate dismissal. His political longevity typified Egypt's political ossification, and he was sometimes criticised for leading a party of the past rather than the future. However, the New Wafd Party survived as a significant opposition party, contributing to the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.

A side wheel gunboat, Pontoosuc was built under contract with G. W. Lawrence and the Portland Company, Portland, Maine, and was named for Pontoosuc, Illinois, on the Mississippi River. She was commissioned at Portland on 10 May 1864 with Lieutenant Commander George A. Stevens in command. Service history Ordered to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 9 June 1864, she soon returned north and on 12 August departed New York in pursuit of the Confederate raider . Arriving at Halifax soon after 0600 on 20 August, she discovered her quarry had sailed. Underway immediately, Pontoosuc continued her search to the north among the fishing fleets in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Tallahassee, however, had turned south en route back to Wilmington, North Carolina. Pontoosuc returned to New York on 30 August 1864 and took up escort duties. By mid- December, she had resumed blockade duties, off Wilmington. On 24 and 25 December she participated in the assault on Fort Fisher, returning to shell the Fort again in the successful mid-January 1865 attack. In February she moved up the Cape Fear River for operations against Fort Anderson. After the fall of Wilmington she resumed cruising off the coast. Seven of Pontoosucs sailors received the Medal of Honor for their actions during this campaign: Cabin Boy John Anglin, Coxswain Asa Betham, Boatswain's Mate Robert M.

Ioan M. Manu, also known as Iancu Manu (1803 - November 29 O.S., 1874), was a Romanian boyar and politician. Biography He was the son of Mihail G. Manu, born into a family of Venetian origins that had moved from Istanbul to Wallachia in the mid-18th century, where it was one of the noble families of Phanariotes. Ioan Manu studied at home and then at the Romanian school of Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, Simeon Marcovici and others. During the rule of Imperial Russian governor Pavel Kiselyov (see Regulamentul Organic), he was a prefect of Gala≈£i, then a prefect of Giurgiu and in 1833, he settled in the capital Bucharest, holding several offices in succession: a Vornic during the reign of Prince Alexandru II Ghica, a secretary of the National Assembly, and an Aga (prefect of police) during the reign of Gheorghe Bibescu (when he organized the first Firefighters' Corps in Wallachia). In exchange for his leadership during the Great Fire of Bucharest (1847), Manu was awarded a \\"sword of honour\\" by the city. During the 1848 Wallachian Revolution, he fled the country, returning after some time, but staying out of politics for a while. He later became a Postelnic (Foreign Minister) during the reign of Barbu Dimitrie ≈ûtirbei. In his political activity, Manu climbed all the boyar ranks, eventually reaching the highest one, that of Great Vornic. In 1858, after the Crimean War removed the country from Russian overseeing, he was, with Emanoil BƒÉleanu and Ioan Al. Filipescu, one of the three Caimacams who administered Wallachia pending the election of a new prince by the ad hoc Divan. In 1859, he supported the former prince Bibescu instead of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, and, during the latter's rule as Domnitor of the United Principalities, he retired from public life. Manu returned only when Carol I replaced Cuza, being elected a member of the Parliament of Romania in the first electoral college (that of landowners), as a representative of Ilfov County.

At the time of her introduction in the premiere episode of the third season, she is a lieutenant who takes charge of the homicide unit's second shift after the previous commander's retirement. Later in the season, a vacancy opens up in the chain of command and she is promoted to captain on a trial basis, as a token of the city's commitment to diversity and equal opportunity. Although she and Al Giardello get along reasonably well, he resents that she was promoted before him even though he had seniority over her. For her part she occasionally feels that he is diminishing or ignoring her authority. Her \\"softer\\" personality and ethical concerns about Frank Pembleton's interrogation methods also put her at odds with others. Her connections to national security officers, however, made her a valuable addition on certain cases. She is a widow, with one daughter named Caroline (played by Sasha Miceli), who was born in 1988. Her husband was a tax attorney named Mike, introduced to her by her sister Eileen at a holiday party for the CPA firm where Eileen worked.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"All Through The House\\", originally aired December 16, 1994. Russert for the most part did not date during her two seasons on the series, though she is introduced to the series already having an affair with Beau Felton (played by the soon-to-be father of actress Hoffman's only child, Daniel Baldwin) - the affair ends soon after their first case is solved, but she supports him as a friend after the breakdown of his marriage. She is a first cousin to the real life Tim Russert, who appears in the third season episode \\"The Old and the Dead.\\" In a later episode titled \\"Stakeout\\" she mentions her famous cousin to a one-shot character named Cathy Buxton (played by Kate Walsh), but the character is unimpressed as she watches a news show that competes with Russert's.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"Stakeout\\", originally aired March 15, 1996. She graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1983.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"Map of the Heart\\", originally aired April 26, 1996. During the 1980s, she worked in the Naval Intelligence Service and spent seven months and nine days at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"For God and Country\\", originally aired February 9, 1996. In season 4, Felton is suspended, ending their connection. In the first of two episodes concerning a sniper, she angers her boss, Colonel George Barnfather, due to problems at a press conference she held and the later suicide of the first sniper. Barnfather strips her of her probationary captain's rank and demotes her to detective, citing incompetence and insubordination. When the shootings begin again, she joins Giardello's shift and eventually gets the second sniper to confess. For the remainder of the season, she is partnered with John Munch. Russert's apparent disappointments lead her to start a new life in Europe with a French diplomat, and she is gone from Baltimore at the start of Season 5. She appears during that season's finale, having returned briefly to Baltimore to help the squad investigate Felton's death. However, Giardello removes both her and Sergeant Kay Howard (Felton's former partner) from the case because they are both too emotionally involved and gives them the job of planning his memorial service instead. This marks the end of Russert's role in the series, but she returns in Homicide: The Movie, a post-series reunion released in 2000.

The Koebner phenomenon may result from either a linear exposure or irritation. Conditions demonstrating linear lesions after a linear exposure to a causative agent include: molluscum contagiosum, warts and toxicodendron dermatitis (a dermatitis caused by a genus of plants including poison ivy). Warts and molluscum contagiosum lesions can be spread in linear patterns by self-scratching (\\"auto-inoculation\\"). Toxicodendron dermatitis lesions are often linear from brushing up against the plant. Causes of the Koebner phenomenon that are secondary to scratching rather than an infective or chemical cause include vitiligo, psoriasis, lichen planus, lichen nitidus, pityriasis rubra pilaris, and keratosis follicularis (Darier disease). Definition The Koebner phenomenon describes skin lesions which appear at the site of injury. It is seen in: :* Psoriasis :* Pityriasis rubra pilaris :* Lichen planus :* Flat warts :* Lichen nitidus :* Vitiligo :* Lichen sclerosus :* Elastosis perforans serpiginosa :* Kaposi sarcoma :* Necrobiosis lipoidica :* Lupus :* Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis :* Still disease :* Cutaneous leishmaniasis :* Post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis A similar response occurs in pyoderma gangrenosum and Adamantiades-Behcet's syndrome, and is referred to as pathergy. Rarely Koebner phenomenon has been reported as a mechanism of acute myeloid leukemia dissemination. Warts and molluscum contagiosum are often listed as causing a Koebner reaction, but this is by direct inoculation of viral particles. The linear arrangement of skin lesions in the Koebner phenomenon can be contrasted to both lines of Blaschko and dermatomal distributions. Blaschko lines follow embryotic cell migration patterns and are seen in some mosaic genetic disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti and pigment mosaicism. Dermatomal distributions are lines on the skin surface following the distribution of spinal nerve roots. The rash caused by herpes zoster (Shingles) follows such dermatomal lines. History The Koebner phenomenon was named after the rather eccentric but renowned German dermatologist Heinrich KoebnerIn the anglicisation of a German word, double vowels are often substituted for the Germanic umlaut on single vowels. The transformation of \\"K√∂bner\\" to \\"Kooebner\\" is just such a case. In the English literature, the umlaut is simply dropped and you often find \\"K√∂bner\\" simply as \\"Kobner\\". (1838‚Äì1904). Koebner is best known for his work in mycology. His intense nature is illustrated by the following: in a medical meeting, he proudly exhibited on his arms and chest three different fungus infections, which he had self-inoculated, in order to prove the infectiousness of the organisms he was studying. The Koebner phenomenon is the generalized term applied to his discovery that on psoriasis patients, new lesions often appear along lines of trauma.

Yangshan Deepwater Port under construction The Port of Shanghai (), located in the vicinity of Shanghai, comprises a deep-sea port and a river port. In 2010, Shanghai port overtook the Port of Singapore to become the world's busiest container port. Shanghai's port handled 29.05 million TEU, whereas Singapore's was a half million TEU behind. Shanghai handled 43.3 million TEU in 2019.  Geography  The Port of Shanghai faces the East China Sea to the east and Hangzhou Bay to the south. It includes the confluences of the Yangtze River, Huangpu River (which enters the Yangtze River) and Qiantang River.  Administration  The Port of Shanghai is managed by Shanghai International Port, which superseded the Shanghai Port Authority in 2003. Shanghai International Port Company Limited is a public listed company, of which the Shanghai Municipal Government owns 44% of the outstanding shares.  History  During the Ming dynasty, what is now the city of Shanghai was a part of Jiangsu Province (with a small part in Zhejiang Province). While Shanghai had become a county seat in the Yuan dynasty, it remained relatively a small town. Its location at the mouth of the Yangtze River led to its development as coastal trade increased during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor in the Qing dynasty. Gradually, the port of Shanghai surpassed Ningbo and Guangzhou to become the largest port in China. In 1842, Shanghai became a treaty port, thus developing into an international commercial city. By the early 20th century, it was the largest city and the largest port in East Asia. In 1949, with the Communist takeover in Shanghai, overseas trade was cut dramatically. The economic policy of the People's Republic had a crippling effect on Shanghai's infrastructure and capital development. Donghai Bridge In 1991, the central government allowed Shanghai to initiate economic reform. Since then, the port has developed at a rapid pace. By 2005, the Yangshan deep-water port had been built on the Yangshan islands, a group of islands in Hangzhou Bay linked to Shanghai by the Donghai Bridge. This development allowed the port to overcome shallow water conditions in its current location and to rival another deep-water port, the nearby Ningbo-Zhoushan port.  Harbour zones  The port of Shanghai includes three major working zones: * Yangshan Deep Water Port * Huangpu River * Yangtze River  Economy  The Port of Shanghai is a critically important transport hub for the Yangtze River region and the most important gateway for foreign trade. It serves the Yangtze economically developed hinterland of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan provinces with its dense population, strong industrial base and developed agricultural sector.

Purpose  The original call to establish the DCC described its function as :\\"...to provide a national focus for research into curation issues and expertise in the processes of digital archiving, preservation and management. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of users of the Centre's outputs.\\" Revised ITT 6/03 Description of call and links to related documents, from JISC website archive Scientists, researchers and scholars across the UK generate increasingly vast amounts of digital data, with further investment in digitization and purchase of digital content and information. The scientific record and the documentary heritage created in digital form are at risk from obsolescence, from the fragility of digital media, and from lack of the basics of good practice, such as adequate documentation for the data.  Activities  Working with other practitioners, the DCC supports UK institutions who store, manage and preserve these data to help ensure their enhancement and their continuing long-term use. The DCC also provides a national focus for research and development into digital curation issues and to promote expertise and good practice, both national and international, for the management of all research outputs in digital format. It provides information about tools developed by the DCC and others which support all parts of the digital curation lifecycle. It provides training in the use of tools and other aspects of digital curation. It provides online tools, such as the Data Management Planning tool, to support the creation and management of research data. The DCC runs a number of regular events to support different aspects of its mission. The International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC) acts as a focus for research activity in digital curation as well as reports of practice. The Research Data Management Forum brings together practitioners from a wide range of backgrounds including government, publishers, researchers and funders, to focus on particular topics of common interest. The Data Management Roadshows aim to raise awareness amongst UK universities of the assistance that the DCC can offer with establishing or improving research data services.  History  Jisc took a decision to establish the Digital Curation Centre some time in 2002, having funded a number of projects in the field of digital preservation. Jisc's then digital preservation focus, Neil Beagrie, recognised that a number of the more compelling challenges required more than simple preservation of materials. The term digital curation was coined to refer to more active long-term management of digital material. The original call for bids to run the center was withdrawn in July 2003,Announcement of postponement of call JISC 6/03 from JISC website archive allowing the UK's e-science programme to add funding for a 4-year research programme to complement the work on education and advocacy funded by Jisc. The revised call from July 2003 required bids by 2003-09-18 with an intention to establish the DCC early in 2004. The range of expertise required meant that the funders expected to see collaborative, multi-centre bids. A number were shortlisted with the winning bid chosen on 2003-11-26. Led by the University of Edinburgh (involving its School of Informatics, the National e-Science Centre (NeSC), the EDINA national data centre and the AHRC Centre for the Studies in Intellectual Property and Technology Law) the winning consortium also included HATII at the University of Glasgow, UKOLN at the University of Bath, and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). The DCC began operations early in 2004, with a formal launch on 5 November of that year at Edinburgh's e-science institute. Although it was intended that the centre would be inaugurated by the Duke of Edinburgh, then the university's Chancellor, he instead had to attend the funeral of Princess Alice and his place was taken by Lord Sutherland of Houndwood.Email from Gill Maddy of NeSC to delegates, 2003-11-03T1104 The first Acting Director was Peter Burnhill, head of EDINA.

The Liverpool City name would be resurrected by the Highfield franchise but there is no connection between the two clubs. =Wigan Highfield ‚Äì 1880‚Äì1895 and 1902‚Äì1933= Highfield Rugby Football Club was formed around 1880 and went out of existence for a few years following the rugby schism of 1895. They reformed in 1902, the club originally playing in a league comprising the \\"A\\" teams of the major clubs. Although no colour photographs of the team exist, it is generally assumed that Wigan Highfield's colours were yellow and blue. Highfield Rugby Football Club played in the Parish of Highfield, in Pemberton, a neighbouring town adjacent to Wigan. In 1921‚Äì22, the club made an application for full Rugby League status, but it was decided that their Tunstall Lane ground was not big enough. By incorporating a field, it was possible to increase the size of the ground and in the 1922‚Äì23 season the club entered the Rugby League as Wigan Highfield. Their first match was against Wigan on 2 September 1922, at Tunstall Lane, in which Wigan beat Wigan Highfield 25‚Äì10. Highfield generally struggled in the lower half of the league tables but in 1927‚Äì1928 they managed to finish above Wigan in 7th place on points percentage. However, in their ten-year existence Wigan Highfield beat Wigan only once, 9‚Äì3 at Central Park on 13 September 1930. In the Challenge Cup, Wigan Highfield's best season was in 1925‚Äì1926 when they reached the semi finals. They saw off Wakefield, Huddersfield and Leeds at Tunstall Lane before losing 15‚Äì6 to Oldham in the Semi Final at Salford. They also reached the Quarter Finals in 1928‚Äì1929 but an 8‚Äì0 loss away at Castleford denied the chance of all Wigan semi final or final. In the Lancashire Cup, Wigan Highfield never managed to progress beyond the first round of the competition. They forced replays against Oldham in 1922 and Leigh in 1931 but all in all, the competition was a pretty miserable experience for them. In 1926, the touring New Zealand Rugby League side visited Tunstall Lane, winning 14‚Äì2 in front of approximately 2,000 spectators. =London Highfield ‚Äì 1933= London Highfield's jersey In 1932, Leeds played Wigan in an exhibition match at the White City Stadium in west London under floodlights. The owner of the stadium, Brigadier-General A C Critchley, was impressed enough to take over Wigan Highfield, who had finished second from bottom in the league, and agreed to pay off their debts. He moved the club to White City and renamed the club London Highfield. The club's old Tunstall Lane ground was sold off for housing. Highfield's first home game on 20 September 1933 was against Wakefield Trinity in front of a crowd of around 6,000 spectators, which they lost narrowly 9 points to 8. Overall London Highfield played 38 games and finished in 14th position on the table that year, having won 20 games and lost 8. During the season, Highfield also played a match against the touring Australians, who won 20 points to 5 in front of a crowd of 10,500 spectators, which was also London Highfield's highest attendance for the season. Despite this reasonable success, the White City Company deemed the venture unprofitable and decided not to continue with rugby league beyond the first season. Player's match fees and expenses, plus compensating other team's travel costs contributed largely to the club's loss that year of ¬£8,000. =Liverpool Stanley ‚Äì 1934‚Äì1950 and the second Liverpool City ‚Äì 1951‚Äì1968 = 150pxIn 1934, Highfield returned north to the Stanley greyhound stadium in Liverpool and became Liverpool Stanley. Liverpool Stanley's colours were distinct yellow jerseys with a blue band around the midriff and also on the sleeves. However, later in their career, due to acute money shortages, the club relied upon handouts and donations, most notably from Mrs Rose Kyle and clothing coupons from supporters. During this period, the kit colours and designs varied drastically, including all-white shirts with black trim, white shirts with black Vs, and an all-blue kit. During their final season as Liverpool Stanley, the club turned out in a white shirt with 'Corporation Green' band around the waist, the same colours they would wear later when they became Liverpool City RLFC. In 1935‚Äì36, Stanley won the Lancashire League. During the Second World War, Liverpool Stanley continued playing, but in 1942 they dropped out, returning after the war in 1945‚Äì46. For the start of the 1950‚Äì51 season, the club moved to Mill Yard, Knotty Ash and was renamed Liverpool City RLFC. City developed the Knotty Ash stadium within their meagre means, mainly by fencing it and erecting a small grandstand. In 1956, they hosted the touring Australian national team, losing 40‚Äì12 in front of a crowd of over 4,700. =Huyton ‚Äì 1968‚Äì1984= In July 1964, the club's board were informed by the Carmelite convent that owned the land that their lease on Knotty Ash would not be renewed. Negotiations then took place with nearby Huyton local authority for a 21-year lease at the new Alt Park Ground. With Alt Park not ready, Huyton spent their first year of existence as homeless nomads. Most home matches were played at Widnes. Alt Park was eventually ready in August 1969. It was of a poor standard and often suffered from vandalism. During their tenure as Huyton RLFC the club's colours were primarily amber shirts with a red and black V and black shorts. In the latter part of the 1970s, the colours changed to red shirts with blue shorts and white socks for a brief period, and eventually an all-black shirt with red collar, white shorts and red socks. It was during this period that club diehard Geoff Fletcher joined Huyton in 1978. Fletcher would remain with the club as player- coach and then subsequently through their various changes as manager in later years. The club continued as Huyton RLFC and struggled in the second division until 1985, when the club moved to Runcorn FC's Canal Street Ground, Runcorn after Alt Park's main stand was declared unsafe. The club then became known as Runcorn Highfield. =Runcorn Highfield ‚Äì 1984‚Äì1990= Around the time of Huyton's proposed move to Runcorn, the then tenants of the Canal Street ground, Runcorn FC, and its board of directors had mooted the idea of gaining extra income by establishing a rugby league club. That year saw applications from new clubs Mansfield Marksman and Sheffield Eagles. When these clubs were elected into the Rugby Football League, Runcorn FC withdrew its application and decided to allow Huyton RLFC to move to their ground instead. Geoff Fletcher remained on initially as player-manager, and then moved unto a role on the board of directors when he retired from playing. As Runcorn Highfield represented the new towns of Runcorn and Halton, the club adopted the green and yellow colours of the football club as well. The first game Highfield played was an exhibition game against local rivals Widnes. They lost 40‚Äì8. Much of their tenure at Runcorn was generally unsuccessful and they drew little local support which was a contributing factor to their eventual departure from Canal Street. Bill Ashurst coached Runcorn between 1987 and 1989. When Runcorn Highfield drew Wigan at home in the John Player Trophy on 13 November 1988, the club's supporters saw it as an ideal opportunity to persuade the people of Runcorn to come and give Highfield a try. However, the directors had the game switched to Central Park in exchange for a fee from Wigan, on the grounds that Canal Street did not have the capacity. The players, seeing that the club would receive more money, asked for a greater share. However the directors refused, leading to a massed players' strike. The team that faced Wigan comprised a number of trialists and reserves together with the coach, Bill Ashurst, who had come out of retirement. Highfield lost 92‚Äì2 in front of a crowd of 7,233 at Central Park and Ashurst was sent off after 11 minutes. The club never seemed to recover from this blow, and they went on to lose every game in the 1989‚Äì90 season, finishing eight points behind second bottom club Nottingham City. Dave Chisnall became head coach of Runcorn in June 1989, he quit in October 1990 after losing all his 38 games in charge. When Runcorn Football Club increased the rent for Canal Street, Runcorn Highfield signed a 99-year agreement with St Helens Town FC in August 1990 and moved to Hoghton Road, Sutton. The move was opposed by St Helens R.F.C. and the Rugby League Board but approved by the full Rugby League Council by 26 votes to 6 on 5 October 1990. The club was renamed Highfield for the 1991‚Äì92 season. Highfield's playing colours were a representative combination of the past incarnations of the club, which consisted of yellow socks, black shorts and predominantly red shirts with yellow, blue and green stripes across the shoulders and sleeves.  Players of Note  Paul Woods was a Welsh rugby union and league player, who turned out for Runcorn Highfield towards the end of his career. Robin Whitfield who, after completing his playing career, became a top class referee Geoff Fletcher who went from player to coach to manager to board member Bill Ashurst was a player coach, another who completed his playing days with Runcorn Highfield =Highfield ‚Äì 1991‚Äì1996= Highfield RLFC club logo In their first season, Highfield finished 14th out of 20 clubs in Division Two, and reached the second round of the Challenge Cup. Two years later they managed 11th place, above such teams as Fulham, Huddersfield, Workington Town and Keighley. However, Highfield only had an average attendance of 331, rising to 515 the following season. Chief Executive Maurice Lindsay wanted to reduce the number of clubs in the lower division of the league in 1993. The three clubs finishing bottom of the second division would be demoted to the National Conference League. It went to the wire with Blackpool and Nottingham City already relegated, the crucial last match at Nottingham on 12 April 1993, between Nottingham City and Highfield saw Highfield, under Geoff Fletcher, win 39‚Äì6 and Highfield survived at the expense of Chorley Borough. The 1994‚Äì95 season was a disaster for Highfield. They won only two games all season ‚Äì against amateurs Ovenden 12‚Äì6 in the first round of the Regal Trophy and against Barrow 14‚Äì12 in the league. They lost to amateurs Beverley 27‚Äì4 in the Challenge Cup and their final game (played at Rochdale Hornets' ground on 23 April 1995) was a humiliating 104‚Äì4 defeat by Keighley. Their final home game was on 17 April 1995 when they lost 34‚Äì8 to Barrow in front of a crowd of 195. Needless to say they finished bottom of the Second Division with only two points. They conceded a grand total of 1,604 points in 30 league games. Despite all this, Highfield survived into the Super League era but fared even worse in the 1995‚Äì96 season, gaining just 1 point all season (a 24‚Äì24 draw against York), their only win coming against amateurs Hemel Hempstead in the first round of the Regal Trophy. Their final game was an 82‚Äì0 defeat away at Hunslet Hawks on 21 January 1996. =Prescot Panthers ‚Äì 1996‚Äì97= Highfield moved to Valerie Park in Prescot during the 1994‚Äì1995 season, a move that was made due to the landlords of Hoghton Road, St Helens Town FC deciding to increase the rent on the ground. Highfield RLFC played there until the start of the 1996 season, when they were then renamed Prescot Panthers to coincide with the start of the Super League. As the Prescot Panthers the club colours were predominantly black shirts with gold checks and band across the shoulders and sleeves, black shorts and black/gold hooped socks. They enjoyed by their standards a comparatively successful season winning two games. They struggled on for the 1997 season again winning two games but bowed to the inevitable and resigned from the league at the end of the season. Ironically the club's final game was a 72‚Äì10 defeat by Carlisle, who were also playing their final league game. Prescot finished at the bottom for a fifth successive season. A brewery loan which had kept the club afloat both at Sutton (Highfield) and later on at Prescot changed hands and the new creditors wanted the loan to be repaid immediately. With this loan, Geoff Fletcher had managed to sustain a social club at Valerie Park which provided the club with a small but sufficient income. When the brewery loan was recalled, the Prescot Panthers went into administration and then ultimately receivership. Chairman Geoff Fletcher accepted a one-off payment of about ¬£30,000 for the club to resign from the Rugby Football League. Equitable payments were then made from the ¬£30,000 to the club's bankers and also to the few remaining Huyton-with-Roby RLFC Ltd Co. shareholders. Rugby league in Liverpool ‚Äì community, schools and universities Rugby league is a developing sport in Liverpool, with many community partners assisting the sport's governing body (RFL) to offer opportunities to participate. These include well established professional clubs in the neighbouring towns of St. Helens and Widnes. The city has a thriving student rugby league scene; Liverpool University took part in the first university game in 1968 and the other universities have been regular participants in the BUSA competition. Today there are a number of non- professional clubs in the city, including Liverpool Buccaneers, who in 2006 won the regional final of the Rugby League Conference and in 2008 were elevated to the Rugby League Conference National division. Two junior clubs, Liverpool Lions (based in Croxteth) and Liverpool Storm (based in Childwall), have been established in 2008. They will be competing in the NWC Junior leagues in 2009. Rugby league has more recently returned to Huyton-with-Roby in the form of the Huyton Bulldogs A.R.L.F.C. Huyton Bulldogs currently compete in the RL Merit League, and their home ground is at the Jubilee Playing Fields, Twig Lane, Huyton. A number of secondary schools throughout Merseyside are now participating in the inaugural merit league and 2008 is the first year that Merseyside schools have qualified for the RFL's Champion Schools tournament. Primary schools have been competing in tag festivals for a few years and the annual Tag World Cup is one of the major events in the Liverpool schools' competition calendar.

The product was developed by NetDynamics, a Silicon Valley start-up company founded in 1995 by Zack Rinat and Ofer Ben-Shachar. Unlike other early application server competitors, NetDynamics chose Java as the development language for the platform. As Java became the dominant development language for web-based applications, NetDynamics experienced significant revenue growth in 1997 and 1998. However, the product soon encountered problems due to the relative immaturity of Java and the rush to release new product versions in a rapidly changing marketplace. Believing that the new JDBC API was too immature, NetDynamics created a proprietary database development API based on a product from Rogue Wave Software. NetDynamics, Inc. was acquired by Sun Microsystems in July 1998.Sun Buys NetDynamics The application server software, together with the Netscape Application Server, was the basis for Sun's iPlanet Application Server offering. Competition NetDynamics initially competed against Bluestone, an application server based on the C Programming Language, and the Kiva application server. By mid-1998, a new competitor, WebLogic, Inc., released a Java application server that was compliant with JDBC and another emerging standard, JavaBeans. WebLogic Application Server eventually won out in the marketplace. The explosive growth of the application server business caught the attention of larger information technology companies. By 1998, the early application server start-up companies were all acquired: Hewlett-Packard purchased Bluestone, Sun Microsystems acquired NetDynamics, Netscape Communications Corporation bought out Kiva, and Weblogic was acquired by BEA Systems.

It was the band's first studio album since The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome in 1977, and the first with the 'classic' line-up since World Record in 1976. The Charisma Records label was reactivated for its release, as well as a reissue series of Van der Graaf Generator's back catalog and Peter Hammill's solo releases from 1972-86. For many years the band's lead singer and principal songwriter Peter Hammill had rejected the idea of a VdGG reunion, but in 2004 (following two one-off, unannounced reunions at Hammill concerts), work began on an official reunion album. Present was the result. It consists of one disc of songs (plus an instrumental, \\"Boleas Panic\\"), and one disc of studio improvisations. The band had always improvised in the studio throughout their history, but never before (excepting the bootleg-quality Time Vaults), had these improvisations been officially released. In 2005, the band embarked on a successful reunion tour. Only two songs from Present, however, were played on the tour: \\"Every Bloody Emperor\\" and \\"Nutter Alert\\".

The \\"assignment for the benefit of creditors\\", also known as an ABC or AFBC is an alternative to bankruptcy, which is a \\"general assignment\\"/\\"assignment\\" concept. ABC liquidation is different to Chapter 7 liquidation usually in that the creditors do not get any input into the procedure and a court is not needed either, so the process is faster in that respect.https://www.southerncaliforniabankruptcylawblog.com/2011/07/18/what- are-abcs/ The United States In the United States, a general assignment or an assignment for the benefit of creditors is simply a contract whereby the insolvent entity (\\"Assignor\\") transfers legal and equitable title, as well as custody and control of its property, to a third party (\\"Assignee\\") in trust, to apply the proceeds of sale to the assignor's creditors in accord with priorities established by law. An assignment for the benefit of creditors is a relatively well-established common law tool and is one alternative to a bankruptcy. An assignment for the benefit of creditors is designed to save time and expense by concluding the affairs of a bankrupt company. The assignment for the benefit of creditors is a state form of bankruptcy action versus a federal form of bankruptcy action. The assignment for the benefit of creditor's process is similar in character to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and parallels some of the same procedures, but is not an actual \\"bankruptcy\\" in the form the word is used in the United States. =Mechanism= The assignment for the benefit of creditors is a common law contract between the board of directors and the assignee in which the board \\"assigns\\" the assets and liabilities of the company to the assignee, a third party. The assignment for the benefit of creditors contract is usually recorded the public record at a town, a city, a county or a state level. Each state will differ on recording requirements for the assignment for the benefit of creditors contract. The physical filing of the assignment usually occurs after: the board of directors has spoken with local insolvency counsel; a board of directors authorization of some nature has been enacted; an appropriate assignee chosen; and the contract has been written. The assignee's primary goal is to try to make the creditors whole. The assignee performs duties similar to a trustee under federal bankruptcy. The assignee has a similar, if not equivalent, fiduciary role as the bankruptcy trustee. The assignee has the primary responsibility to: liquidate the assets of the company; vette creditor claims; and issue a dividend to the creditors. The creditors are the assignee's top priority, not shareholders. Shareholders by definition have a residual claim on assets once all creditors are satisfied. The assignee, once the assignment process is completed, issues a dividend. The dividend is derived from the sale of assets, collection of receivables, recovery of the bankrupt company's assets and cash. Certain creditors may or may not receive a dividend. The assignee's hope is to provide a one-to-one redemption of the creditor's claims; however, this depends on the amount of cash an assignee can marshal in the liquidation process. The claims process is similar to a standard bankruptcy action in which creditors submit claims to the assignee for review and acceptance. The acceptance and vetting of claims is an important process to ensure that no one creditor has overstated their claim. There are rare occasions in which an assignee may issue a non-cash dividend as part of the overall dividend to creditors on their claims, but a dividend of this type is not common. If all the creditors are made whole, shareholders would then have a claim on the remainder of the dividend. This holds true only if there are no other classes of equity that have priority senior to the shareholders. The order of creditor's claims usually follows the normal bankruptcy order prescribed in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, generally secured, and unsecured in descending order. The assignee, depending on the specific state law may use Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code as needed. Neither the federal bankruptcy court nor a state court usually oversee this process, however the assignee is subject in most cases to a look back provision within the state the assignment took place. A Federal Bankruptcy Court judge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy must approve the sale of the bankrupt company's assets, thus adding time and expense on to the entire liquidation process. The assets sold in an assignment for the benefit of creditor process do not usually require a judge's intervention. It is this removal of the court from the liquidation process which increases the speed of the assets sold in an assignment process. This is one substantial difference from a regular bankruptcy. =Creditors= Secured and unsecured creditors constitute the creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors are ahead of shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy. =Secured creditor influence= If there has been a determination by company management and interested parties such as a secured creditor that even after restructuring, a \\"going concern\\" may still not be viable, a secured creditor or group of secured creditors frequently may encourage the company's senior management to pursue this liquidation mechanism. Secured creditor(s) may encourage this type of action to relieve themselves of the legal costs and risks associated with the foreclosure and sale of its collateral. One specific risk a secured creditor wants to avoid is preference or the perception of preference in the liquidation process (see fraudulent transfer). In situations where the liquidation value of the assets exceeds a secured creditor's lien, the assignee is not normally required to obtain the consent of a secured creditor or any other creditor prior to the assignment process. Cooperation of the secured creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset. An assignee in practice may obtain the consent of the secured creditors in advance of the assignment to ensure that the assignee can liquidate the asset or assets in a timely manner without a secured party stopping or holding up the assignment process. Secured party consent in this case is optional, not necessary. In situations where the liquidation value of the assets is less than a secured creditor's lien, the assignment process can be done, however a vast number of legal questions need to be reconciled before the assignment process can possibly be initiated. There unfortunately is no concise answer in this particular situation. Secured creditors may in certain instances assume the senior management roles within the bankrupt company, however noted earlier this situation occurs when the secured creditor(s) have foreclosed on their lien. Large secured creditors again may influence the decision making process, but that secured creditor can not enter into that contract on behalf of the bankrupt company. Only the bankrupt company's senior management and/or board of directors have the power to do an assignment. =Dividend= The dividend is hopefully the payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted and all the assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are in the form of cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate. =Key attributes of the process= Noted earlier this is a state form of bankruptcy, not federal form. The assignment process or any bankruptcy process for that matter is a legal matter. The state attributes of an assignment process may be understood by any attorney however a local/regional bankruptcy attorney in the specific state usually is best equipped to handle the legal end of the process for the company making the assignment. This is not asserted to diminish an attorney's capabilities, but to stress the legal niche that this legal instrument falls within, bankruptcy. Non legal staff familiar with bankruptcy and the assignment process can also affect the speed validity of the process. =General assignment attributes= The general rule is that any debtor may make an assignment. This would include any individual, partnership, corporation or limited liability company that owes anything to anyone. Any debtor owning property has the common law right to make an assignment. Other common law countries In other common law countries, general assignments usually refer to any general assignment of existing or future book debts by a natural person (including, in some cases, partnerships). A general assignment made by a natural person who is subsequently adjudged bankrupt is void against the trustee in bankruptcy as regards any book debts which have not been paid prior to the presentation of the bankruptcy petition. The definition of book debts includes \\"debts which in the ordinary course of business would be entered in a well-kept trade book\\",Re Shipley v Marshall [1863] 4 C.B. 566 future debts and future rents under a hire purchase agreement. Bills of exchange also fall within the definition of book debts,Re Siebe Gorman v Barclays Bank Plc [1979] 2 Lloyds Rep 142 but a bank balance does not.Re Brightlife Ltd [1987] 1 Ch 200 Under (for example) English law, any general assignment, either absolute or by way of security, of book debts is void unless registered under the Bills of Sale Act 1878. A trustee would not be able to attack an assignment under this section which relates to debts due from specified debtors or debts becoming due under specified contracts or where the debts were assigned as part of a bona fide transfer of a business or the assignment is for the benefit of creditors generally.

She proved able to hear incoming aircraft, providing the crew with an early warning. After part of the crew transferred from the Gnat to the Grasshopper in June 1939 the ship was sent to Singapore after the British declaration of war on Germany. There she was on board the ship during the Battle of Singapore, which saw Grasshopper evacuate for the Dutch East Indies. It was sunk en route, and Judy was nearly killed having been trapped by a falling row of lockers. She was rescued when a crewman returned to the stricken vessel looking for supplies. On the deserted island with the surviving crew, Judy managed to find a fresh water source saving them all. They made their way to Singkep in the Dutch East Indies and afterwards to Sumatra aiming to link up with the evacuating British forces. After trekking across 200 miles of jungle for five weeks, during which Judy survived an attack from a crocodile, the crew arrived a day after the final vessel had left and subsequently became prisoners of war of the Japanese. She was eventually smuggled into the Gloegoer prisoner of war camp in Medan, where she first met Leading Aircraftsman Frank Williams, with whom she would go on to spend the rest of her life. Williams convinced the camp Commandant to register her as an official prisoner of war, with the number '81A Gloegoer Medan'. She was the only dog to be registered as a prisoner of war during the Second World War. She moved around several more camps, and survived the sinking of the transport ship SS Van Waerwijck where in the aftermath she saved several passengers from drowning. Les Searle from the Grasshopper smuggled her once again into the next camp, where she was reunited with Frank Williams. After the end of the war, Judy's life was put in danger once again. She was about to be put to death by the Japanese guards following a lice outbreak amongst the prisoners. However, Williams hid the dog until the Allied forces arrived. Searle, Williams, and others smuggled Judy back to the UK aboard a troopship and she spent the next six months in quarantine after arriving. She was awarded the Dickin Medal by the PDSA, considered to be the animals' Victoria Cross. Judy died in 1950 in Tanzania from a tumour, after travelling with Williams there to work on a groundnut food scheme. Her Dickin Medal and collar were subsequently put on display at the Imperial War Museum as part of 'The Animal's War' exhibition. Early life Judy was a pure-bred liver and white Pointer. She was born in February 1936 in the Shanghai Dog Kennels, a boarding kennel used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China. Judy was one of seven puppies to a dog named Kelly owned by a couple from Sussex. At the age of three months, she escaped and had been kept in a back alley by a shopkeeper until she was six months old. Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the kennel, her mother and siblings were no longer there. In the autumn of 1936, the crew of the Insect class gunboat HMS Gnat voted to get a ship's mascot. This was due in part to the competitive nature of the gunboats, with HMS Bee, Cicada, and Cricket already having mascots of their own. The Captain and the Chief Bosun's mate, Lt. Cmdr. J. Waldergrave and Chief Petty Officer Charles Jefferey, purchased Judy from the kennel and presented her to the crew. As her mother was known as Kelly of Sussex, Judy was listed as Judy of Sussex in her Royal Navy paperwork. It was hoped to train her as a gundog, but the men began to treat her like a pet instead, and several days after her arrival, Jefferey's log stated that \\"our chances of making her a trained gundog are very small.\\" Her time spent on the streets of Shanghai was blamed for her lack of hunting instinct; the only time that she would point in the traditional manner was when she could smell food. Military career =HMS Gnat= HMS Gnat, photographed in 1922 Able seaman Jan \\"Tankey\\" Cooper was given the job of being the \\"Keeper of the Ship's Dog\\", who was also the ship's butcher. She was given an open box and a blanket to sleep on. She was trained to stop her from going into certain areas of the ship, such as those inhabited by the Chinese cooks as they disliked her. In November 1936, she fell overboard from the forecastle into the Yangtze River and was spotted by Jefferey. The ship was called to a full stop and a power boat deployed to retrieve her. The incident was recorded in the ship's log as a man overboard exercise. As the boat returned to the Gnat, the crew sent the semaphore message \\"Judy's christening completed\\". The crew began to find the dog useful in navigating the river, as she was able to alert them to cess boats in sufficient time to close all hatches and minimise the smell. After undergoing trials following a refit, the Gnat met up with the Ladybird, who also had a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy alerted the ship to the presence of river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure. One of Judy's litters of puppies. Judy also pointed out the approach of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised as he looked back that she had been pulling him away from a leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour. In early 1938, both Jefferey and Cooper were sent back to Britain as part of the crew rotation. While docked in Hankou, Judy took a liking to another Pointer on board a French gunboat Francis Garnier. The two ship's companies held an impromptu wedding ceremony for the two dogs. The French Pointer, Paul, remained on the Gnat for three days before returning to his ship. Judy fell pregnant, and gave birth to thirteen puppies. Ten of them survived and were eventually given away to a variety of sources including the Francis Garnier and the American gunboat USS Guam. Judy was involved in an incident in October that year that resulted in the ending of her trips ashore in Hankou. Whilst being walked by two sailors from the Gnat, they were confronted by Japanese soldiers who pointed a loaded rifle at Judy. One of the soldiers was thrown into the Yangtze River by Leading Seaman Jack Law in response. During the following days, several Japanese officers came on board the Gnat and it was decided that it would be better for Judy to stay on the ship. =HMS Grasshopper= HMS Grasshopper, photographed in 1940. In June 1939, several Locust class gunboats arrived on the Yangtze to take over operations from the existing Insect class vessels. Part of the crew of the Gnat transferred to HMS Grasshopper, including Judy. Following the British declaration of war on Germany in September that year, several of the river gunboats, Grasshopper included, were redeployed to the British base at Singapore. Judy was initially sea sick, but the crew ensured that she was properly exercised and by the time the ship arrived on station, she had recovered. Initially the stay at Singapore was peaceful, and Judy stayed with a customs official and his family for a week ashore. The ship was rarely deployed until January 1942 when it was deployed with other gunboats to provide covering bombardments along the coast of Malaya for retreating troops, and occasionally to carry out evacuations. By this time, Judy was primarily being looked after by Petty Officer George White. The Battle of Singapore took place between 8‚Äì15 February. On the first day, along with the other military vessels, Grasshopper was sailed out to sea to provide anti-aircraft fire. By 11 February, Grasshopper and its sister ship Dragonfly were the largest vessels left at Singapore. On 13 February, the vessels were ordered to evacuate personnel and leave Singapore. The ships left at 9pm that evening, and travelled together. White later reported that Judy had \\"personally greeted virtually everyone on board\\". The ships headed for Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Fearing the Japanese Navy, they sought to travel via the Lingga Islands hoping that the island group it sat in could be used as a hiding place. As they approached on 14 February, Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness. The Grasshopper was hit with a single bomb before the planes departed. Judy was below decks when the planes returned. The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly. The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs, and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread close to an ammunition compartment. Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over a hundred yards to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels. It was only when they were ashore that they realised Judy was not with them. The island they arrived on turned out to be uninhabited with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes. Five days after the Grasshopper was bombed, a tongkang arrived which took the survivors to Singkep Island, the largest of the Lingga Islands. There they left their wounded, and Judy along with the other survivors travelled two days later on a Chinese junk to Sumatra where it was hoped that a British force remained which could take them to Sri Lanka. Upon arrival, they took the vessel up a series of rivers until they narrowed so much that the junk could not pass. They then embarked on a cross- country trek across the island in an attempt to reach Padang. During the journey through the jungle, Judy was attacked by a crocodile and suffered a cut to her shoulder. The survivors patched up the cut with their limited first aid supplies. She continued to warn them of approaching predators, and one crewman claimed she saved him from a Sumatran tiger. They emerged from the jungle at Sawahlunto, where they caught the train towards Padang. The group missed the last evacuation ship by nine days, with the Japanese due to arrive to take over the city at any moment. After the arrival of the Japanese, the survivors from the Grasshopper along with Judy, were taken into custody as prisoners of war on 18 March. =Prisoner of war= Medan The crew became prisoners of war, initially held in Padang, but were soon moved onto Belawan. They smuggled Judy on board the transport trucks, hidden under empty rice sacks. After five days they arrived at the Gloegoer prisoner of war camp in Medan. Chief Petty Officer Leonard Williams recorded, \\"thus began 3‚Äì4 years of the most horrific labour, torture, starvation, and every degradation the Japanese could inflict on us\\". She was looked after by Les Searle from the Grasshopper, and a Private named Cousens who had a job making leather goods for the guards. Cousens would feed scraps of leather to Judy, but died of malaria a short time after the two servicemen had stolen a large quantity of rice from the Japanese. In August, Judy met Leading Aircraftman Frank Williams, who adopted her and shared his daily handful of rice. In the camp Judy would intervene by distracting the guards when they were administering punishment. She was the only animal to have been officially registered as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, after Frank William's intervention to protect the dog from the guards, who would often threaten to shoot Judy as the dog growled and barked at them. Williams managed to convince the camp Commandant, who was drunk on sake, to sign the registration papers with the promise of one of Judy's future puppies. Judy's official prisoner-of- war name was '81A Gloegoer Medan'. During her stay at the camp, she would alert the prisoners to the approach of the Japanese guards and also if other animals such as snakes or scorpions were around. She also made excursions from the camp, looking for food, and would bring back rats and snakes to Williams. Judy had another group of puppies, of which five survived. One of them was given to the camp Commandant as promised and another puppy was smuggled into the women's camp along with any food that the men could spare. A further puppy was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one more was beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in the camp after Judy and Williams left. In June 1944, the men were transferred to Singapore aboard the SS Van Waerwijck, renamed to the Harukiku Maru by the Japanese. Dogs were not allowed on board, but Frank Williams managed to teach Judy to lie still and silent inside a rice sack. When he boarded the ship, Judy climbed into a sack and Williams slung it over his shoulder to take on board. For three hours the men were forced to stand on deck in the searing heat, and for the entire time Judy remained still and silent in the bag on Wiliams's back. The conditions on board the ship were cramped with more than 700 prisoners. On 26 June 1944, the ship was torpedoed by HMS Truculent. Williams pushed Judy out of a porthole in an attempt to save her life, even though there was a drop to the sea. Over 500 of the passengers did not survive. Return to Sumatra Frank Williams was recaptured and was sent to a new camp without news of Judy's survival. However, stories began being told of a dog helping drowning men reach pieces of debris on which to hold, and others recalled how the dog would bring them flotsam to keep them afloat. She had been found in the water by other survivors of the sinking, and once again hidden from the Japanese. Upon arrival at a dock, she was found by Les Searle who tried to smuggle her onto a truck with him. However, she was discovered by a Japanese Captain who threatened to kill her ‚Äì whose order was countermanded by the newly arrived former Commander of the Medan camp and she was allowed to travel with Searle onto the new camp. Williams was giving up hope of finding Judy when she arrived in his new camp. After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a \\"special mission\\" to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants. The experience saw a change in the dog, with Frank later writing, \\"She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct.\\" Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone. In early 1945, Frank began to find that Judy was more aggressive towards the Japanese and Korean guards. Although he'd normally send her into the jungle to avoid them, on one occasion, the guards gave chase and shot at the dog. He later found Judy bleeding from the shoulder where she had been grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some palm fronds, but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part of a plan to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared when the Japanese forces abandoned the camp. Post war and awards An example of a Dickin Medal. Two members of the Royal Air Force (RAF) parachuted in, and informed the residents to remain until allied troops arrived. Judy was smuggled aboard the troopship Antenor heading to Liverpool. Together with Williams, Searle, and two others, Judy managed to avoid the dock police and was delivered into the care of the ship's cook, who ensured that she was fed on the voyage home. Frank revealed Judy to the crew after six weeks, as the ship was three days from arriving in Liverpool. Although some low-ranking crew members had become aware of the dog before this, the Captain had not. Initially angry, he was talked around by Frank. Between the Captain and RAF serviceman Brian Comford, whose father was a barrister, the authorities were convinced to allow the dog to land. Upon her return to the UK, Judy stayed for six months in quarantine in Hackbridge, Surrey. Frank visited regularly, as did a number of servicemen who had known the dog during their internment in Asia. The quarantine was not free, and Frank was required to pay ¬£12 to cover the costs. He could not afford this, so an advert was placed in the December 1945 edition of the Tail-Waggers Club magazine. A total of ¬£18, 18 shillings and eight pence was raised from 61 donations. Judy was released from quarantine on 29 April 1946 to Frank, and the pair headed immediately to London. A ceremony was organised by the Kennel Club, with chairman Arthur Croxton Smith awarding her a \\"For Valor\\" medal. During his posting to Sunninghill Park with Judy, where he underwent refresher training from the RAF, Frank would sell photographs of the dog to raise money for the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. They were then posted to a base in West Kirby, Merseyside. The story of Judy grew over time, with features in national newspapers calling her \\"Gunboat Judy\\". At an event held in Cadogan Square by the PDSA in May 1946 and attended by Maria Dickin, Judy was awarded the Dickin Medal, which is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Williams was given the White Cross of St Giles, with each awarded by Major Viscount Tarbat MC, chairman of the Returned British POW Association. Judy was enrolled as the association's only canine member. She was interviewed by the BBC for their radio coverage of the London Victory Celebrations of 1946 on 8 June and her barks were broadcast around the world as part of the programme In Town Tonight. The pair appeared at the \\"Stars of Blitz and Battlefront\\" event held at Wembley Stadium, in front of over 82,000 spectators along with fellow Dickin Medal winner Rob. The two dogs had become friendly at various events where they appeared together, and at Wembley when a Borzoi bit Judy backstage, Rob came to her defence. In response, the Borzoi's appearance was cancelled. Frank and Judy spent the year after the war visiting the relatives of PoWs who had not survived; Frank remarked that Judy always seemed to give a comforting presence. They raised money for charities and appeared at dog shows throughout the country. Upon meeting David Niven, he remarked that she was the \\"loveliest bitch he had ever clapped eyes on\\". On 22 July 1946, the pair were demobilised. Frank took Judy home to Portsmouth. Judy's grave in Tanzania, Africa. On 10 May 1948, the pair left to work on a government-funded groundnut food scheme in East Africa. There was some difficulty in getting permission for Judy to travel, and it was feared that she and Williams would be split up. This issue was promoted in the Evening Standard, and after the involvement of William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme, permission was given for Judy to travel with Williams. She had a third and final litter of puppies during her time in Africa. After two years there, Judy was discovered to have a mammary tumour; an operation removed the growth, but a tetanus infection soon set in, and she was euthanized on 17 February 1950 at the age of nearly 14. She was buried in her RAF jacket, with her campaign medals, the Pacific Star, the 1939‚Äì1945 Star, and the Defence Medal. Frank spent two months building a granite and marble memorial in her memory, which included a plaque that told of her life story. The memorial, in Nachingwea, had lost its plaque and was in disrepair by 2016. On 27 February 1972, Judy was remembered in church services across Gosport and Portsmouth. Her story was told in a book entitled The Judy Story in 1973, and in 1992 it was featured in the British children's TV show Blue Peter. In 2006 her collar and Dickin Medal went on public display for the first time in the Imperial War Museum, London, as part of \\"The Animals' War\\" exhibition. It was presented to the IWM by Alan Williams, Frank's son.

History Carving representing Tihori, ancestor of the MƒÅori tribe NgƒÅti Awa of Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. =Early history= NgƒÅti Awa traces its origins to the arrival of MƒÅori settlers on the MƒÅtaatua waka (canoe). The MƒÅtaatua settlers established settlements in the Bay of Plenty and Northland. Initially, the tribe controlled a large area in Northland, but conflicts with other northern iwi resulted in a southward migration. One group eventually settled in the eastern Bay of Plenty, whose descendants would eventually found the iwi. Awanuiarangi II is recognised as the eponymous ancestor of NgƒÅti Awa. Awanuiarangi II was a chief descended from Toroa, captain of the MƒÅtaatua. Descendants of Awanuiarangi II eventually formed their own iwi, NgƒÅti Awa, named after their ancestor. =Tribal and land wars= NgƒÅti Awa was frequently at war with neighbouring iwi, including those with similar ancestry. NgƒÅti Awa initially had good trading relations with European settlers. However, the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s resulted in the British Crown confiscating more than 1,000 km¬≤ of NgƒÅti Awa land. For more than a century afterwards, NgƒÅti Awa remained an aggrieved, struggling people. However, in 1999, the Waitangi Tribunal determined that the confiscation of NgƒÅti Awa land in the New Zealand Wars by the British Crown was illegal, and in 2003 a settlement was reached between NgƒÅti Awa and the New Zealand Government. In the nineteenth century NgƒÅti P≈´keko were considered a separate iwi, but they are currently considered a hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Awa. =Government settlement= In 2003, following almost ten years of negotiations between the New Zealand Government and NgƒÅti Awa, a settlement was announced and reparations were made to the iwi. In summary: *The New Zealand Government ('the Crown') acknowledged and apologised for the illegal confiscation of NgƒÅti Awa land during the New Zealand Wars *The Crown paid NZ$42.39 million in reparations to NgƒÅti Awa *The Crown agreed to return control of seven sites of historical and cultural significance to the iwi *Three locations were renamed in accordance with original NgƒÅti Awa place names.

The film stars Josh Charles, Jon Bon Jovi, Annabella Sciorra, Penelope Ann Miller, Joanna Going and JoBeth Williams. It went straight to video in the UK.  Plot  The movie begins with Kevin sitting in an AA support group saying he thought his relationships with women would change after he stopped drinking. Kevin sees a woman he wants, but loses interest in her after he gets her. He realizes this is not a healthy relationship pattern but doesn't know how to change it. Rebecca, a single woman new to the \\"small town\\" of San Francisco, meets Kevin, the sexy, but promiscuous bartender at her new job. Although Kevin comes onto her immediately, Rebecca recognizes Kevin's playboy ways and rebuffs him, however, the two become good friends. Kevin is Adam's friend who drives a cab to support himself while he pursues his passion for painting. Adam confides in Kevin about his girlfriend, Nina. Adam thinks she is having an affair, but he also tells Kevin that Nina's suspected infidelity only bothers him because someone else is paying attention to her. He gives Kevin the analogy that when he was young, he had a toy car that he became tired of, but regained interest in it after his little brother started playing with it. Kevin tells him how messed up that is, but Adam only shrugs it off. Later, Nina comes home and, when Adam tries to initiate sex, she tells him she is tired. Quickly realizing he may become suspicious, she changes her mind and decides to sleep with Adam, even though she has just come from sleeping with her lover. Kevin and Nina, who is a chef in a ritzy restaurant, meet in a Catholic church where he tells her that Adam suspects she is cheating on him. Nina is alarmed and asks Kevin if Adam knows who her lover is. Kevin, it turns out, is the man in which she is cheating on Adam with because she was feeling neglected by Adam. The two express guilt over deceiving Adam, but they also acknowledge they can't stay away from each other. Nina also feels that Adam is not over his ex-girlfriend, Kate, who left him for a woman, Anne, when Kate came out as a lesbian. Adam, figuring out Kevin is the man sleeping with Nina, confronts him at the bar where Kevin and now also Rebecca work. Kevin tells Adam he wasn't treating Nina right and tells him he knows that Adam is not truly in love with Nina. Even though Adam knows Kevin is right, he is still angry and smashes a shot glass against the bar wall before storming out. Rebecca, being new in town and unlucky in love, meets Anne at a coffee shop. Even though she doesn't have a serious interest in being a lesbian, she decides to sleep with Anne to see if it excites her more than sleeping with men, which has so far been underwhelming for Rebecca. She tells Anne she doesn't know what the big deal about sex is, saying why should two people huff and puff, rubbing up against each other, when she can accomplish the same thing by herself in two minutes. She and Anne are interrupted during Rebecca's first lesbian experience by Kate who returns home early after finally coming out of the closet to her parents. She catches Anne and Rebecca in bed together and walks out. Rebecca, realizing she is not really a lesbian, is embarrassed and doesn't see Anne again. Kate, who is often seen in monologue with her unseen therapist, is heartbroken after finding Anne with another woman. Anne, it is revealed, has been looking for a reason to break it off with Kate, who is younger and more serious about the relationship. Anne does not like the domestic routine the two have settled into and tells Kate that she has never been very good at monogamy. After confronting Nina about her affair with Kevin, Adam and Nina break up. Realizing Kate is no longer with Anne, Adam sees it as an opportunity to get back together with Kate, although she tells him it's not possible. Adam meets Rebecca when he picks her up in his cab on her way to a blind date. They recognize each other from the scene in the bar and are instantly attracted to each other. Although she warns Adam that she is not very comfortable with her own body and doesn't feel terribly connected to it in bed, Rebecca discovers sex with Adam is better than any experience she has had before. Kevin, after Nina and Adam break up, tells her that their relationship wasn't just sex and that he's in love with her. Nina, knowing Kevin's past indiscretions of dumping women after he sleeps with them and loses interest, doesn't believe his love declaration and tells him she doesn't want to see him again. Adam and Rebecca are happy until Kate calls him and tells him she wants to get back together and wants him to father a child. He is initially angry with Kate, telling her that her timing is way off and he is now seeing someone. He feels bad about it, but he breaks up with Rebecca and tells her he is getting back together with Kate. Rebecca is hurt and tells Adam that she is the one that broke Kate and Anne up when Kate caught the two in bed and says she supposes that makes her and Kate even. She also tells Adam not to call her when Kate inevitably breaks his heart again. Kate tries to settle into the rekindled relationship with Adam, but realizing she is really a lesbian, she breaks it off again. This time she tells her unseen, silent therapist that she has decided to stay single and try to get to know herself. Nina turns up pregnant but doesn't know if the baby is Kevin's or Adam's because she slept with both of them the same night. Kevin still proclaims his love for Nina, but she is still suspect of his feelings. Adam finds out she is pregnant, but with the three of them not knowing whose child it is, everything is put on hold. Adam finally goes to Nina's place to have it out with her over who is the father of her baby. He finds Nina and Kevin there together who tell Adam that they have decided to get married. Adam is angry but acquiesces seeing that Kevin really loves Nina. Nina tells both of them she doesn't want to know who is the biological father of her child and tells Adam that she and Kevin are going to raise the child. Rebecca, hearing everything from Kevin and knowing that Adam won't call her, goes to see him, where the two resume their relationship.

It was opened in October 1994 by Trevor Gulliver, Fergus Henderson, and Jon Spiteri on the premises of a former bacon smoke-house. Under Henderson's guidance as head chef, St. JOHN has specialised in \\"nose to tail eating\\", with a devotion to offal and other cuts of meat rarely seen in restaurants, often reclaiming traditional British recipes. Typical dishes include pigs' ears, ducks' hearts, trotters, pigs' tails, bone marrow and, when in season, squirrel. As a result, St. JOHN has developed a following amongst gastronomic circles: \\"chefs, foodies, food writers and cooks on sabbatical\\". Awards and accolades St. JOHN has won numerous awards and accolades, including Best British and Best overall London Restaurant at the 2001 Moet & Chandon Restaurant Awards. It has also been consistently placed in Restaurant magazine's annual list of the Top 50 restaurants in the world. In 2011, it was placed 41st, up from 43rd in the 2010 rankings. It was awarded a Michelin star in 2009. St. JOHN Hotel was awarded a Michelin star in September 2012.

(It can also be used for estimating one's own position based on observations of multiple emitters). TDOA and FDOA are sometimes used together to improve location accuracy and the resulting estimates are somewhat independent. By combining TDOA and FDOA measurements, instantaneous geolocation can be performed in two dimensions. It differs from TDOA in that the FDOA observation points must be in relative motion with respect to each other and the emitter. This relative motion results in different doppler shifts observations of the emitter at each location in general. The relative motion can be achieved by using airborne observations in aircraft, for example. The emitter location can then be estimated with knowledge of the observation points' location and vector velocities and the observed relative doppler shifts between pairs of locations. A disadvantage of FDOA is that large amounts of data must be moved between observation points or to a central location to do the cross-correlation that is necessary to estimate the doppler shift. The accuracy of the location estimate is related to the bandwidth of the emitter's signal, the signal-to-noise ratio at each observation point, and the geometry and vector velocities of the emitter and the observation points.

The screenplay by Howard Koch is based on the 1941 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title by Ellen Glasgow. The cast included the established stars Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland as sisters and rivals in romance and life. Raoul Walsh also worked as director, taking over when Huston was called away for a war assignment after the United States entered World War II, but he was uncredited. This film was the third of six films that de Havilland and Davis starred in together. Completed in 1942, the film was disapproved in 1943 for foreign release by the wartime Office of Censorship, because it dealt truthfully with racial discrimination as part of its plot. Plot In Richmond, Virginia, Asa (Frank Craven) and Lavinia (Billie Burke) (n√©e Fitzroy) Timberlake gave their two daughters male names: Roy (Olivia de Havilland) and Stanley (Bette Davis). The movie opens with the young women as adults. Asa Timberlake has recently lost his piece of a tobacco company to his former partner William Fitzroy (Charles Coburn), his wife's brother. Roy, a successful interior decorator, is married to Dr. Peter Kingsmill (Dennis Morgan). Stanley is engaged to progressive attorney Craig Fleming (George Brent). The night before her wedding, Stanley runs off with Roy's husband Peter. Fleming becomes and stays depressed, but Roy soon decides to keep a positive attitude. After Roy divorces Peter, he and Stanley marry and move to Baltimore. Roy encounters Fleming again after some time, and she encourages him to move on with his life. They soon begin dating. Roy refers a young black man, Parry Clay (Ernest Anderson), to Fleming, and he hires him to work in his law office while he attends law school. Parry is the son of Minerva Clay (Hattie McDaniel), the Timberlake parents' family maid. William Fitzroy, Lavinia's brother and Asa's former partner in a tobacco business, doted on his niece Stanley and gave her expensive presents and money, but was very upset when she ran off. He says he will throw Fleming some of his legal business if he agrees to stop representing poor, black clients. When Fleming refuses, Roy Timberlake is impressed and decides to accept him in marriage. In Baltimore, Stanley and Peter's marriage suffers from his heavy drinking and her excessive spending. Peter takes his own life. Shaken, Stanley returns to her home town with Roy. After she recovers, Stanley decides to win back Fleming. While discussing her late husband's life insurance with Fleming at his office, Stanley invites him to join her later for dinner. When he fails to come to the restaurant, she gets drunk. While driving home, she hits a young mother and her young daughter. Severely injuring the woman and killing the child, in a panic, Stanley drives away. The police find Stanley's car abandoned with front-end damage and go to question her. Stanley insists she had loaned her car to Parry Clay the night of the accident. On the strength of this accusation from a rich, white woman alone, Perry Clay is taken into custody. However, Roy suspects that Stanley is hiding the truth, and asks Minerva Clay what she knows. Minerva, despondent about her son being unjustly accused, tells Roy that Perry was home with her all evening, studying. Stanley continues to dissimulate and refuses to admit her responsibility, even when Roy arranges for her to see Parry at the jail where she tries to get him to confirm her story that Perry drove the fateful car and promises him she'll do all she can to get him out once he's been convicted. Later, Fleming confronts her once more: he has questioned the bartender at the restaurant, where Stanley has left an indelible and negative impression: he knows Stanley left drunk around 7.30 pm, just before the time of the accident. Fleming plans to take Stanley to the district attorney, but she escapes to her uncle's house and pleads for his help. Having just discovered he has only six months to live, Fitzroy is too distraught to do anything. The police arrive at Fitzroy's house: Stanley sees them and escapes through the back door and the garden. While pursued by the police, she crashes her car and dies.

Recommended by the director John Huston, the screenwriter Howard Koch believed he had to tone down these elements to satisfy the current Motion Picture Production Code. In his review of the completed film, the critic Bosley Crowther said it was \\"moderately faithful\\" to the novel and praised its portrayal of racial discrimination. Bette Davis, eventually cast as Stanley Timberlake despite her desire to play the \\"good sister\\" Roy, was unhappy with the script. \\"The book by Miss Glasgow was brilliant,\\" she later recalled. \\"I never felt the script lived up to the book.\\" Nor did Glasgow. \\"She minced no words about the film,\\" Davis said. \\"She was disgusted with the outcome. I couldn't have agreed with her more. A real story had been turned into a phony film.\\" Davis was also unhappy about events during production. While in the midst of costume and wig fittings, Davis was told her husband Arthur Farnsworth had been admitted to a Minneapolis hospital with severe pneumonia. Her friend Howard Hughes arranged a private plane, but her flight took two days because of being grounded by fog and storms. Almost immediately, studio head Jack L. Warner cabled her to demand her return to the film. Due to his pressure and her concern for her husband, Davis' own health declined. Her doctor ordered her to return to Los Angeles by train to get some rest before returning to work. Distressed to play Stanley rather than Roy ‚Äì \\"I was not young enough for the part,\\" Davis insisted ‚Äì the actress argued with producers about every aspect of her character. She directed her hair style and makeup. She insisted that Orry- Kelly redesign costumes for her, resulting in what others saw as an unflattering wardrobe. Davis aided the project by finding the right person to play Parry Clay. Huston had reviewed some African-American actors but was not satisfied with any. One day when Davis was in the studio commissary, she noticed Ernest Anderson working there as a waiter. She believed he had the right look and presence for the role and encouraged Huston to screen test Anderson. The director then cast the young man. Anderson won the 1942 National Board of Review Award for his performance. Three days following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which pulled the U.S. into World War II, Huston had to leave the production for an assignment with the United States Department of War. The studio used Raoul Walsh to complete the film, although he received no screen credit. Walsh and Davis immediately clashed, and she refused to follow his direction or reshoot completed scenes. She developed laryngitis and stayed off the set for several days. After she returned, the producer Hal B. Wallis frequently acted as mediator between Davis and Walsh, who threatened to quit. Because of the delays, the film was not done until mid-January 1942, well over schedule. The first preview was highly negative, with audience comments especially critical of Davis' hair, makeup, and wardrobe, the elements which she had controlled. Preparing for Now, Voyager, Davis disregarded the comments. She thought the film was \\"mediocre,\\" although she was glad that the role of Parry Clay was \\"performed as an educated person. This caused a great deal of joy among Negroes. They were tired of the Stepin Fetchit vision of their people.\\" When the U.S. wartime Office of Censorship reviewed the film in 1943 before foreign release, it disapproved the work because \\"It is made abundantly clear that a Negro's testimony in court is almost certain to be disregarded if in conflict with the testimony of a white person.\\" Critical reception Bosley Crowther of the New York Times called it \\"neither a pleasant nor edifying film.\\" He felt \\"the one exceptional component of the film\\" is the \\"brief but frank allusion to racial discrimination\\" which \\"is presented in a realistic manner, uncommon to Hollywood, by the definition of the Negro as an educated and comprehending character. Otherwise the story is pretty much of a downhill run.\\" He added \\"Director John Huston, unfortunately, has not given this story sufficient distinction...The telling of it is commonplace, the movement uncomfortably stiff. Olivia de Havilland gives a warm and easy performance as the good sister who wins out in the end...But Miss Davis, by whom the whole thing pretty much stands or falls, is much too obviously mannered for this spectator's taste...It is likewise very hard to see her as the sort of sultry dame that good men can't resist. In short, her evil is so theatrical and so completely inexplicable that her eventual demise in an auto accident is the happiest moment in the film.\\"New York Times review Variety noted \\"John Huston, in his second directorial assignment, provides deft delineations in the varied characters in the script. Davis is dramatically impressive in the lead but gets major assistance from Olivia de Havilland, George Brent, Dennis Morgan, Billie Burke and Hattie McDaniel. Script succeeds in presenting the inner thoughts of the scheming girl, and carries along with slick dialog and situations. Strength is added in several dramatic spots by Huston's direction.\\"Variety review Box office According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,651,000 domestically and $1,143,000 foreign. Home media On April 1, 2008, Warner Home Video released the film as part of the box set The Bette Davis Collection, Volume 3, which includes The Old Maid; All This, and Heaven Too; Watch on the Rhine; and Deception.

History and profile In the 1950s, there were only about 50,000 fish keepers in Germany and the hobby was, at the time, considered as traditionally very time-consuming, rare, difficult and complicated because it required routine collection of live food from streams and river beds, until the invention of dried flake food (Tetramin) for tropical fish by Dr. Ulrich Baensch. Baensch's Tetramin fish food consisted of four different type of flakes and vitamins.

He raced as a professional from 1957 to 1960. Rivi√®re, a time trialist, all-around talent on the road, and a three-time world pursuit champion on the track, lost his career to injury. He was considered to have a chance of winning the 1960 Tour de France but crashed on the Col de Perjuret descent of Mont Aigoual in the Massif Central while following leader Gastone Nencini. Rivi√®re hit a guard-block on the edge of the road, falling 20 meters into a ravine. He landed in brush, breaking two vertebrae. Early career Rivi√®re started as a track rider, at the old velodrome in St-√âtienne. At 19 he beat Jacques Anquetil for the national pursuit championship at the Parc des Princes in Paris. He turned professional in 1957, when he beat Albert Bouvet to win the world pursuit championship at Rocourt, Belgium. Hour record On the advice of his team manager, Rapha√´l G√©miniani, and his agent, Daniel Dousset, Rivi√®re attempted Ercole Baldini's hour record on 18 September 1957 at the Vigorelli track in Milan. He was still in national service in the army at Joinville, near Paris, although in a battalion which allowed the country's top athletes to train at public expense. He rode a 7.28m gear and took the record with 46 km 923m. He won the world pursuit championship again in 1958, at the Parc des Princes, beating Leandro Faggin in the final with 5m 59s, the first time the title had been won in less than six minutes. He said he would attack the hour again, on 23 September. He rode 53√ó15 (7.48 m),Rey, Jean-Paul (2000), 100 Rois de la Petite Reine, Solar, France higher than that usually used by sprinters. He punctured but started again and became the first rider to exceed 47 km/h.

After a long moment, Rivi√®re reappeared. He was wearing a helmet covered in nylon, varnished shoes and a world champion's jersey made of silk. He rode a few laps of the track behind a scooter and then stopped.Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France Rivi√®re thought the draught blowing through the stadium too strong and wanted to return to his hotel. At 6pm he agreed with Dousset and his soigneur, Roger Provost, to start the ride. Ren√© de Latour wrote in Sporting Cyclist: :One lap of the Vigorelli track is 397 metres. The bell was to ring every 30.8 seconds. If Rivi√®re was on the [finish] line, it meant that he was riding at Baldini's pace. But right from the first kilometre, Rivi√®re forgot all the warnings. He was going like mad, and the man with the bell whose jobs it was to signal his position each time the bell rang had to run as much as 30 yards a lap.Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated copy On finishing, he asked journalists whether he was talking coherently and not still giddy from going round and round the track.Dazat, Olivier (1987), Seigneurs et For√ßats du V√©lo, Calmann-Levy, France His record lasted nine years. Tour de France crash Rivi√®re giving an interview during the 1960 Tour de France A monument records where Rivi√®re fell. thumb Rivi√®re was one of 14 riding for France in 1960. It was his second participation and he had become one of the favourites. But his talent made him careless with training and what he ate. Rivi√®re had a personal war with another French rider, Henry Anglade. Rivi√®re won the opening time trial but Anglade had the yellow jersey of leadership by day six. Rivi√®re took his revenge, even though they were in the same team, by attacking 112 km from the finish at Lorient. He beat Anglade by 14 minutes. Only a German, Hans Junkermann, Jean Adriaenssens of Belgium, and Gastone Nencini of Italy could stay with him. Rivi√®re won the stage and Nencini the overall lead. The Tour took the Perjuret on 10 July 1960 on a stage from Millau to Avignon. It had never previously been that way.. Eurosport.fr (10 July 2008). Retrieved on 7 August 2014. Rivi√®re followed Nencini wherever he went. He had only to hold him until the final time-trial and beat him by 1m 38s to win the Tour. On the zig-zags of the col de Perjuret, Nencini passed fourth with Rivi√®re behind him. Nencini was known as the fastest descender in the world, famous for his dangerous and risky trajectories, and Rivi√®re tried to follow him. He hit a low wall soon after the start of the descent and fell over it, rolling down the slope. A team- mate, Louis Rostollan, raised his hand to call the team manager, Marcel Bidot. He, journalists and officials found Rostollan peering into the ravine. Rivi√®re's bike was nearby, its forks pushed back and its frame twisted. Rivi√®re had broken his back. A helicopter took him to hospital in Montpellier. Antoine Blondin wrote: :On a bend, we saw a rider, the tall Rostollan, making demented gestures and running back up the hill and shouting 'Roger has fallen! Roger has fallen!' It was impossible to stop on the gravelled toboggan on which we'd embarked. Nobody had seen Rivi√®re disappear. For five minutes, we thought he had been vaporised, purely and simply crossed off the map of the world, of which the immense and chaotic landscape around us gave the scale. Well, he was lying 20 or so metres below with a broken spine that forbade him the slightest gesture, the least call. His head was resting on a bed of rocks, his eyes open to the mountainous (rugueuse) countryside that surrounded him. :When we managed to stop in the hamlet of Vanels to collect our breath, we still didn't know exactly what had happened, but anxiety showed on the faces of all who passed us. One by one, face after face, the event was written there... Finally, Radio Tour announced: 'Roger Rivi√®re has been the victim of a serious accident'... The helicopter, which couldn't land on the steep slope where Rivi√®re had ended up after his fall, turned above us in the way that vultures circle.Cited Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France Doctors found pain-killers in Rivi√®re's pockets and more in his body. Rivi√®re nevertheless blamed his mechanic, saying his brakes were faulty. \\"I pulled them on but they didn't work.\\" The brakes were examined and found to be faultless. He then said there was oil on his rims. He withdrew the accusation in face of criticism. He later sold the story of his drug use to a newspaper, admitting he had taken Palfium during the climb of the Perjuret, a painkiller that could have affected his reflexes and judgment. In 1961, Miroir du Cyclisme republished an article originally written for Libre Sant√© by Rivi√®re's friend and dietician, Clarisse Brobecker. She confirmed the theory that Rivi√®re was so numbed by painkillers that he either hadn't attempted to pull on the brakes or had been unable to.Miroir du Cyclisme, France, April 1961 Rivi√®re admitted taking amphetamines and solucamphor during his hour record in 1958 ‚Äì including tablets during the attempt.Jean-Paul Olivier (1992), La Tragedie du Parjour: Roger Riviere, Glenat, France He said he had an injection of solucamphor and amphetamine before the start and swallowed several amphetamine tablets.France Dimanche, France, cited Cycling, UK, 4 November 1967, p. 17 Retirement and death Rivi√®re never regained full use of his limbs. He lived the rest of his life in a wheelchair, considered an 80 per cent invalid. He opened a restaurant in Saint-Etienne called 'Le Vigorelli', after the Velodromo Vigorelli track in Milan where he twice set the world hour record. It failed and he opened a garage, and finally a holiday camp in the Rhone Valley. Those too failed. \\"Rivi√®re, who succeeded at the impossible, found the possible more difficult,\\" said the writer, Olivier Dazat. Rivi√®re died of throat cancer at 40.

He has played two games with the Denmark national under-21 football team. Playing style Rasmussen's strengths are in one-on-one situations, relying on his quick reactions and vision for the game, but he has been criticized for not commanding his field on especially corner kicks and free kicks, due to his lack of height. Club career Born in Stenvad near Grenaa, Steffen Rasmussen played his youth football in minor club Stenvad Boldklub, before joining the youth setup of AGF Aarhus. He spent a year with lower- league Jutland Series club Grenaa IF, before returning to AGF. He established himself as second-choice keeper behind Erik Boye, and signed a professional contract with AGF in March 2002. Under new manager Poul Hansen, Rasmussen made his Danish Superliga debut for AGF against Odense Boldklub on 10 November 2002, replacing Boye at half-time. As Boye suffered a back injury, Rasmussen played the next three games in a row. Boye returned to the starting line-up, but following another injury, Rasmussen established himself as AGF's first choice, playing the last 13 games of the Danish Superliga 2002-03 season. In August 2003, AGF brought in Rune Pedersen to replace the retiring Boye. Rasmussen began the Danish Superliga 2003-04 season as starting goalkeeper, but lost his place to Pedersen in April 2004 following a slump in form. He was second choice for the Danish Superliga 2004-05 season, but following an injury to Pedersen in April 2005, Rasmussen got another chance and again established himself in the starting line-up. He was the undisputed first-choice goalkeeper for the Danish Superliga 2005-06 season, missing only four games through a hand injury. He was named the AGF player of the season, but could not keep AGF from being relegated. He stayed with AGF in the Danish 1st Division. He suffered a shoulder injury during the season, but helped the club bounce right back into the Superliga. He played all 33 games of the Danish Superliga 2007-08 season. Before the Danish Superliga 2008-09 season, he was named captain of the team by AGF coach Ove Pedersen, replacing Peter Graulund. He missed only two games that season, due to a hand injury. In the 0‚Äì1 defeat to FC Midtjylland on 14 April 2010, Rasmussen got his first red card in his AGF career, following a foul on Jonas Borring. He missed two games through suspension. Despite playing 31 of 33 games, Rasmussen could not keep AGF from being relegated at the end of the Danish Superliga 2009-10 season.

He made his under-21 debut in an April 2003 friendly match, and played an additional friendly game for the team in August that year.

Despite his setting of the 50 m and 100 m freestyle national records in 2008, Murphy just missed qualifying for Ireland's team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He did, however, manage to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Murphy was educated at Belvedere College, Dublin, he is a member of Aer Lingus Swimming Club. In September 2005, Murphy began attending, and competing for, the USA's University of Tennessee; the 2008‚Äì09 school year marked his senior year of swimming for the Tennessee Volunteers. Meet results =European Championships, Budapest 2006= At the 2006 Irish Open Short Course Championships, Murphy broke the Irish record in the 100 m freestyle record in a time of 48.97 and also the 100 m individual medley record in a time of 55.88 seconds. One week later at the 2006 European Championships in Budapest, he broke both the 50 m freestyle record in a time of 22.63 and also Earl McCarthy's 10-year-old record in 100 m freestyle in a time of 50.79. He also holds a number of Irish junior records including 50 m breaststroke. =European SC Championships, Rijeka 2008= He broke the Irish senior record for the 50 m breaststroke in a time of 28.37 which qualified him for the semi- finals, where he finished 16th. At the 2008 European Short Course Championships Murphy broke four Irish records, cutting 0.75 off his own 50 m freestyle record in 21.71, the old time was 22.46. In the semi-final he lowered his record once again to 21.53. He also broke Andrew Bree's 100 m breaststroke record in a time of 59.51; the previous record stood at 59.98. His 50 m split of 27.57 was also a national record. Murphy also finished 4th in the 50 m breaststroke at the same 2008 European SC Championships in a new national record of 26.73 seconds, just 0.07 seconds outside the medals. Murphy also broke his own national records in the 100 m freestyle and 100 m individual medley recording 48.69 & 55.34 respectively. =NCAA Championships, College Station, TX 2009= Murphy set a new University of Tennessee Men's record in the 50 yd freestyle with a 19.14. =World Championships, Rome 2009= Murphy swam the meet of his life at the World Swimming Championships in Rome, 2009. He became the first Irishman to swim a sub 50 second 100 m freestyle, leading off the Irish 4 √ó 100 m freestyle relay with a 49.95. Later in the meet he lowered his record again with a 49.76. The relay also set the Irish record. He also tied the 100 m breaststroke Irish record. The record was set in 2008 at the Beijing Games by Murphy's good friend and Tennessee Teammate Andrew Bree. Both men held the record at 1:01.76 at the time. Murphy had the swim of his life in the heats of the men's 50 m breaststroke. He set a new World Championship record and Irish record with a time of 27.26. This time qualified him for the Semi-final of the 50 m breaststroke. In doing so, Murphy became the first Irishman to achieve this feat. In the semi- final, Murphy swam a 27.38, just 0.12 seconds from making the final. Murphy's final individual swim of the meet was the 50 m freestyle. He set a new Irish record of 22.14 and finished 19th. He missed the semis by three spots and was just 0.15 seconds outside the top 16. Murphy was also a member of the 4x100 medley relay that set Irish records. His split of 60.6 on the breaststroke leg. This was the fastest in Irish History. =Club Wolverine International Elite Team= After the year in which Murphy completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Tennessee, he moved to Ann Arbor, to train under world- renowned sprint coach Mike Bottom and swim for the prestigious Club Wolverine. Murphy trains as a part of the International Elite Team. This is a group of international swimmers dedicated to bettering themselves, the community and the sport by training, promoting and evolving swimming. =European Championships, Budapest, 2010= After just 7 weeks under Coach Bottom, Murphy traveled to the European Swimming Championships in Budapest. In the 100 breaststroke Murphy swam to a textile suit best of 1:02.43. The 50 breaststroke was next. Murphy progressed through the heats, semis and final in a 28.08, 27.60 and 27.99. This was the first time an Irishman has qualified for a sprint final in a European Championship. The semi final time of 27.60 was ranked 6th in world at the time, and this was also the highest an Irishman had been ranked for many years. =Indianapolis, USA, 2011= Murphy won the gold medal in the 100 m breaststroke final at the Indianapolis Grand Prix on 3 March 2011. His time of 1:00.77 was an Irish senior record.Murphy wins in Indianapolis This time is within the qualification period and qualifying time for the London 2012 Olympics. This makes Barry the first Irish male to qualify for London, and possibly the first swimmer in the World too. =London Olympics 2012= Murphy was training for the London 2012 Olympics, at Michigan University. A documentary was made about this process, which included reference to his Indianapolis 2011 result but which did not discuss how far he went with his dream. Murphy qualified for the 2012 Olympics, at both the 50 m freestyle and the 100 m breaststroke, finishing in 29th place in both events. Charity work Barry Murphy became an ambassador for the Asthma Society of Ireland in 2012. Barry was diagnosed with asthma at the age of fifteen, but keeps his asthma under control through proper asthma management under the supervision of a healthcare professional. In August 2012 he fronted the launch of ‚ÄòAsthma Coach‚Äô an iPhone App designed to help people manage their asthma. References *Murphy's bio from the University of Tennessee Athletics website.

Cambr√©sis () is a former pagus, county and prince-bishopric of the medieval Holy Roman Empire that was annexed to the Kingdom of France in 1679. It is now regarded as one of the \\"natural regions\\" of France, and roughly equivalent to the Arrondissement of Cambrai in department Nord. The capital of Cambr√©sis was Cambrai. Originally ruled by a dynasty of counts, Cambr√©sis became a prince- bishopric in 1007, comparable to the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge and the Prince- Bishopric of Utrecht. It encompassed the territory in which the bishop of Cambrai had secular authority.  History  = Romans and Franks = Cameracum became important during the Roman Empire in the 3rd and 4th century due to its textile industry, taking over as administrative capital of the civitas Nerviorum from Bagacum Nerviorum (modern Bavay) around 400. As a Roman cultural capital it maintained its importance as the seat of a bishop (which it became before 400), whose jurisdiction stretched to medieval Hainaut and Brabant in the north. Early medieval sources such as Volume II of Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks (written late 6th century) and the anonymous Liber historiae Francorum (written early 8th century) mention a Salian Frankish warlord named Chlodio or Chlogio, who conquered Turnacum (modern Tournai) and Cameracum in the 5th century. According to Lanting & van der Plicht (2010), this probably happened in the period 445‚Äì450. Around 509, the ruler of Cameracum, Ragnachar, was killed by his relative Clovis I, who then annexed the Frankish state around Cameracum. As an early Frankish territory, the Pagus Cambrecensis can be found in surviving records as early as 663.Ulrich Nonn (1983) Pagus und Comitatus, p.118. = Middle Ages = In 925, Cambrai came into the possession of East Francia (later the Holy Roman Empire) and, together with the surrounding area, constituted a county, which would become known as Cambr√©sis, the genitive of Cambrai.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Kamerijk ¬ß Geschiedenis\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. The last dynastic count, Arnulf of Valenciennes, renounced his comital rights to Cambr√©sis to obtain the support of the bishop of Cambrai against his enemy Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders. The German king Henry II transferred the comital rights to the bishop of Cambrai in 1007, in line with the Ottonian policy of creating an Imperial Church System. As a worldly lord, the bishop thus became a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. From the end of the 11th to the end of the 12th century, the emperors designated the counts of Flanders as guardians of the county, resulting in extensive Flemish influence. The city of Cambrai itself resisted episcopal rule ever since 1077, and eventually became a free imperial city in the High Middle Ages. = Habsburg influence = In the 15th century, the Duchy of Burgundy managed to acquire de facto control over Cambr√©sis. During the War of the Burgundian Succession (1477‚Äì1482) France conquered the city, but Emperor Charles V managed to retrieve Cambr√©sis for the Holy Roman Empire in 1529 (War of the League of Cognac, ended by the Ladies' Peace of Cambrai), and again in 1543 (Italian War of 1542‚Äì1546). Although the Prince-Bishopric of Cambrai was formally neutral, its war-time neutrality was frequently violated by both French and Habsburg troops, and ever since Charles V placed a garrison inside Cambrai in 1543, Cambr√©sis remained inside the Habsburg sphere of influence until 1679. It was never annexed by Habsburg, however: it was not added to the Burgundian Circle, it was mentioned in neither the Transaction of Augsburg of 1548, nor the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, it had no representation at the States General of the Habsburg Netherlands, and thus was not one of the Seventeen Provinces. When the Imperial Circles were introduced in 1500, Cambr√©sis was included into the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian Circle. In the Imperial Register of 1521, the bishop of Camerich is recorded as having the duty to provide a contingent of 22 men on horse and 82 men on foot, and 120 Rhenish guilders. The 1532 Imperial Register records Camerich in the Niderlendisch vnnd Westuelisch Kray√ü ('Netherlandish and Westphalian Circle') with the obligation of providing 44 cavalrymen and 164 infantrymen. The Imperial Register of 1663 mentions: 'Vor disem hat man zum Westph√§lischen Craisse auch gerechnet die Bisch√∂ffe von Vtrecht vnd Camerach' (\\"For this, one has also counted the Bishops of Utrecht and Camerach to the Westphalian Circle\\"). In their 1654 Topographia Circuli Burgundici, part of Topographia Germaniae series, Martin Zeiler and Matth√§us Merian the Elder described Cambr√©sis as the Stifft Camerich: 'Concerning the Prince-Bishopric of Camerich: formally, this [land] belongs to the [Holy] Roman Empire and to the Westphalian Circle, and in this book, it is also considered as such. The Bishop of this Bishopric, who is both the Spiritual and Temporal Lord there, has his own seat and vote in the Imperial Diet. Nevertheless, the capital city of Camerich, or Cameracum, currently has a Spanish garrison, and this diocese is located between the two Counties of Artois and Hainaut that are under Spanish protection. Moreover, Lodovico Guicciardini mentioned it with Artois, although others mentioned it with Hainaut. Therefore, we also want make a mention of it here. We will wait with the description of this little state until the entry on the city of Camerach, and now order this most distinguished place of these three lands according to the ABC.' Zieler and Merian thus pointed out that Cambr√©sis was de jure still an independent principality, whose bishop held both secular and religious authority, but it was surrounded by Spanish territories and occupied by Spanish troops, and like other writers before them, they decided to geographically describe Cambr√©sis in conjunction with the lands of the Burgundian Circle rather than the Westphalian Circle to which Cambr√©sis officially belonged. The further history of Cambr√©sis would be related under the entry of the city of Cambrai, which was to be found alphabetically rather than geographically. = France = Cambr√©sis was not annexed by the French kings until the 1678 Peace of Nijmegen after a siege in 1677, becoming part of the French province Flandre and Hainaut. The count- bishops continued to refer to themselves as princes of the Holy Roman Empire until the French Revolution.Instructions Pastorales sur le Jubil√© On 2 November 1789, during the French Revolution, all church property was nationalised, which meant the end of Cambr√©sis.

Composition  A keyboard protector is usually made with plastic, polyurethane or silicone. Comparatively, silicone is a more protective and stronger substance which cannot be penetrated by liquids (unless they are corrosive alcohol), such as oil and water. Working principle A keyboard protector is placed on top of a keyboard to reduce its contact with the physical environment. Some keyboard protectors have flaps with adhesive lining to be attached to the bottom of the keyboard. For example, keyboard protectors protect against dirt, crumbs, hair. Most often than not, they do NOT protect against liquid spill or liquid damage (water, drinks, rain). Leaving an open keyboard-protected laptop in the rain for two minutes will still most likely result in severe damage to the computer. There is a higher chance of protection from minor spills or splashes directed on a small portion of the keyboard only, but in general keyboard protectors do not protect your laptop from liquid damage. Advantages and inconvenience A keyboard protector is usually washable and can be used immediately after purchase. Computer users who are accustomed to typing without the keyboard protectors may take some time to become accustomed, since the keystrokes are dampened and the force needed to apply to the keys are different. These factors may also affect their typing speed and accuracy. Some keyboard protectors, such as those made of silicone, can also require very regular cleaning and maintenance as they become dirty and covered in different substances, often reducing their effectiveness.  Compatibility  Since there are several major types of keyboards in the market, some with different layouts, the compatibility of keyboard protectors is also important in order to have the keyboard fully and well protected. Different keyboards will often feature slightly different key spacing or arrangement, leading to ill-fitting protectors.

It lies between the cities of Bautzen and L√∂bau in a valley between the hills of the Czorneboh, the Hochstein and the Bieleboh, all part of the northernmost mountain ranges of the Lusatian Highlands. It is one of the more populous villages in Upper Lusatia and the longest street village in all of Germany.  Municipal structure  The municipality of Cunewalde consists of the following districts: * Cunewalde *Halbau *Sch√∂nberg *Weigsdorf-K√∂blitz Unofficial districts include Klipphausen, Neudorf, Zieglertal, Fr√ºhlingsberg, B√§rh√§user and the Albert-Schweitzer-Siedlung. History Cunewalde's first documentary mention dates back to 1222, but its origins may be significantly older. It is plausible that an early inhabitancy could already have existed at a street between Bautzen and the so-called \\"B√∂hmisch Zwickau\\" (Bohemian Zwickau) around the year 1000 or even further back. The real settlement, however, started in the 13th century when colonists from Franconia and Thuringia came to find a new place to live in this region. On the river banks of the Cunewalder Wasser, the settlers were each assigned a plot of land to cultivate as a meadow, field or forest. These individual stretches of land would have a length of up to each, leading to the settlement becoming a typical Waldhufendorf. Cunewalde itself never had the misfortune of being turned into a battlefield, though its inhabitants, too, had to suffer under the consequences of some of history's great struggles. In the years between 1631 and 1633 about half of the population fell victim to an outburst of the Bubonic Plague, and in the Seven Years' War the valley of Cunewalde was used by the Austrian general Daun as a place to collect and form his army in preparation of the Battle of Hochkirch in 1758. For the first 500 years of its history, Cunewalde consisted almost entirely of smaller and bigger farms inhabited by the local peasants. However, after the gruelling Thirty Years' War had finally come to an end in 1648, the developing handicraft became more important. It was most notably supported by exiles from Bohemia who brought with them the practice of weaving, which very quickly came to be the village's main trade. Most notably, the \\"Cunewalder Hemd\\" was famous in the region because of its astonishing quality. At the end of the 19th century, the small weavers in their typical Upper Lusatian houses had to face a growing textile industry. Cunewalde was one of the first places in the Upper Lusatia region with big industry-buildings. During that time, the infrastructural network was also developing at a rapid pace, as a new railway- connection between Gro√üpostwitz and Cunewalde was opened in 1890 and eventually extended to the nearby city of L√∂bau. The line was given up in 1998 and has since been turned into a cycle track.  Main sights  View of the main village with church * Dorfkirche Cunewalde is Germany's biggest evangelical village church. Built from 1781 to 1783, its main hall and three galleries provide seating for up to 2632 churchgoers. The interior is characterised by three large Bohemian crystal chandeliers and a 3-manual organ from 1840. * On the Czorneboh stands the oldest observation tower in Upper Lusatia, a stone building that was constructed in 1851. * Cunewalde has an above average number of traditional Upper Lusatian Houses in varying but mostly good condition. * The Polenzpark is a park that was created after the example of an English Garden with small ponds and winding paths. * Diplomat Deutschland GmbH has been headquartered in Cunewalde since 1922.

History Eden was founded in 1976 in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, 12 miles southwest of downtown Minneapolis. Originally, Eden designed and manufactured sound-reinforcement (public address) systems, in particular speaker cabinets and then drivers, whose popularity grew amongst sound engineers and with musicians. After a short initial period building such specialist equipment, the company realized the popularity that their cabinet products were gaining with bass players. The company was also involved in a side project, designed a new type of cabinet for SWR, to be called the Goliath cabinet. Eden and its amplifier design also developed in parallel to its expanding cabinet business and moved from sound reenforcement to specialize in the bass sector of the music market. Maintaining a position that good bass amplification should deliver clear and un-coloured tone with a lot of headroom, the Eden World Tour product line eventually emerged. Eden has undergone many changes including moving its production from Minnesota to Chicago when Eden became part of U.S. Music Corporation in 2003. This change also allowed the brand to increase the resources available to develop more products and enter into production of amplifiers and combos for less experienced players. In December 2011, Eden left U.S. Music Corporation and became part of the Marshall Amplification family. Following this move, Eden became much more widely available around the world, primarily due to its improved distributor network. Eden WT800 World Tour Series Bass Amplifier. =2012-present= Eden Amplification became part of Marshall Amplification PLC in December 2011, and subsequently their headquarters moved to the Marshall Amplification factory in Bletchley, UK. This acquisition allowed Eden products to be distributed through Marshall Amplification's global distribution network, increasing the availability and visibility of Eden products in Europe and Asia. A new flagship line of amplifiers was released in 2015 to replace the World Tour series, called the World Tour Pro range. This was followed in 2016 by the lightweight Terra Nova range. The line of bass effects pedals has also expanded, all based on the chassis design of the WTDI pedal. The first-ever battery-powered combo specifically for bass launched in 2014, called the MicroTour. In 2016, Eden applied their high-fidelity philosophy to produce a ukulele combo, the E-Uke. In Summer 2016, production of D-Series cabinets was moved to the Marshall Amplification facility in Bletchley. The speakers are still manufactured to Eden's specifications by Eminence Speaker in Kentucky. Products =Nemesis Series, 2001- 2011= By 2000, Eden had become known as a high-quality, hi-fidelity, high power, high- price manufacturer of professional grade equipment. In 2001, Eden introduced its Nemesis series of amplifiers, cabinets, and combos at significantly lower pricing, lower power, and lower power handling than the World Tour amps and D-Series cabinets. This brought the clarity of the \\"Eden sound\\" into the budget range of many weekend warriors and semi-professionals. Up until the introduction of the Nemesis line, all the Eden amps and cabinets were made in the United States. The Nemesis line was manufactured in China. They continued the Eden tradition of one-piece aluminum chassis construction for extra durability and toughness. The Nemesis series amps were different from the World Tour series of amps in that they had an entirely FET solid state pre-amp as well as amplifier and one semi-parametric EQ control along with the standard bass, mid, and treble shelving controls. Most of the Eden WT series used a hybrid pre-amp with both tube and solid-state components and a solid- state amplifier. There were three completely solid-state WT amps (WT330, WT390, and WT405) that used a \\"Golden Ear\\" chip to get the warmth found in the hybrid World Tours. The Nemesis did not have that chip. The Nemesis amps still achieved the same clarity of sound that their much more expensive World Tour series did but, lacking the tube or the Golden Ear chip in the pre-amp circuitry, did not have the warmth of the World Tour series. The new Nemesis amps used a blue face instead of the well-known gold face of the WT series and were known as the NA series (Nemesis Amp) in both heads and combos. They were very articulate amplifiers and became popular with the \\"touch bass\\" crowd, which needed the articulation more than the warmth, as well as a lot of rock bands, which also didn't miss the warmth but needed the clarity. The Nemesis series cabs were totally different than any cabs made before as they were constructed from a cellulose composite material and were lighter than the D-series cabinets. They also had lower power handling capabilities. They were sonically designed for use with the Nemesis amps and were also offered in a wide range of combos. Although they were still manufactured and sold, the Nemesis line didn't appear in the Eden catalog again until 2005 when some changes were made to the EQ section of the Nemesis line. 2007 heralded the introduction of the Nemesis RS series combos, which offered Edge control to add tube-style grit (noticeable at high gain/high volumes), Pre-/Post-EQ selector for the DI output, Footswitch for Enhance Bypass and Mute functions, and changed the cabinets back to void-free plywood construction from the cellulose composite material. The following year (2008) the RS-series heads became available separately as the RS-400 (400 watts at 4 ohms) and the RS-700 (700 watts at 2 ohms). This Nemesis RS series was specifically designed \\"with rock bassist firmly in mind...to address the needs of players who want an aggressive, mix-cutting sound.\\" They all featured a black face with a large, blue, backlit Nemesis logo across the top of the amp face. 2007 was also the last year the blue-faced Nemesis NA amplifiers were sold. The Nemesis Silver series was also introduced in 2007 with the serious younger player in mind. In 2008 they just became the N series with a black face instead of a silver face. These were smaller lower powered combos and since they included an auxiliary input for either RCA jacks or standard 1/4\\" jack, you could plug two basses in at once if you liked. Besides the targeted market of those just getting into bass playing, they quickly became favorites of instructors who needed to plug 2 basses into one amp that didn't shake the store down, and also earned a spot as a \\"leave at home\\" practice amp with simplified tone controls for semi-pro and professionals alike. This series eventually evolved into the e-series amp and combos currently offered (2014). In 2009, the RS series went through a cosmetic make-over and were re-labeled as the EN (Eden Nemesis) series. (All electronics and capabilities stayed the same as the RS series.) The XST version of Nemesis cabs were first introduced this year as all the Nemesis cabs were also renamed from RS to EN. This was the last year of the Nemesis series under the Nemesis name. In 2010, the Nemesis line morphed one final time. Under ownership of USM after the founder had departed, the decision was made to pull the Nemesis EN amplifiers into the newer Black-Faced WTB series. At the time the only other WTB amp was the WTB1000, which was basically a WT800 with selectable 8-band graphic EQ and one semi-parabolic control. The only similarity between the WTB1000 and the WTB400 and WTB700 was the single semi-parabolic control that could be turned on or off. Otherwise they were entirely different pre-amp and power sections. In 2010, the Nemesis cabs changed from being the EN series into 2 distinctly different series - The EX series replaced the previous EN series and the E-xxxXST series replaced the ENxxxXST series. That was the end of the Nemesis cabinets. From 2001 through 2010 the Nemesis series offered an imported solution to great sound at a lower power and price than the top of the line Eden offerings. Other Eden offerings have taken their place, but the Nemesis series itself disappeared in 2010.Eden catalogs 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010/2011 (all Eden catalogs issued from 2001-2011)  References  External links *Eden Amplification Official Website *Eden Amplification Forum *Eden WTDI Preamp Product Review Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States Category:Guitar amplifier manufacturers Category:Companies based in Lake County, Illinois Category:Buffalo Grove, Illinois Category:JAM Industries ","title":"Eden Electronics"},{"id":"6631658","text":"NUS Services Ltd (NUSSL) is a company which provides services to student unions in the United Kingdom.

The problem was formalized by the French mathematician Gaspard Monge in 1781.G. Monge. M√©moire sur la th√©orie des d√©blais et des remblais. Histoire de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie Royale des Sciences de Paris, avec les M√©moires de Math√©matique et de Physique pour la m√™me ann√©e, pages 666‚Äì704, 1781. In the 1920s A.N. Tolstoi was one of the first to study the transportation problem mathematically. In 1930, in the collection Transportation Planning Volume I for the National Commissariat of Transportation of the Soviet Union, he published a paper \\"Methods of Finding the Minimal Kilometrage in Cargo-transportation in space\\".Schrijver, Alexander, Combinatorial Optimization, Berlin ; New York : Springer, 2003. . Cf. p.362Ivor Grattan-Guinness, Ivor, Companion encyclopedia of the history and philosophy of the mathematical sciences, Volume 1, JHU Press, 2003. Cf. p.831 Major advances were made in the field during World War II by the Soviet mathematician and economist Leonid Kantorovich.L. Kantorovich. On the translocation of masses. C.R. (Doklady) Acad. Sci. URSS (N.S.), 37:199‚Äì201, 1942. Consequently, the problem as it is stated is sometimes known as the Monge‚ÄìKantorovich transportation problem. The linear programming formulation of the transportation problem is also known as the Hitchcock‚ÄìKoopmans transportation problem. Motivation =Mines and factories= Suppose that we have a collection of n mines mining iron ore, and a collection of n factories which use the iron ore that the mines produce. Suppose for the sake of argument that these mines and factories form two disjoint subsets M and F of the Euclidean plane R2. Suppose also that we have a cost function c : R2 √ó R2 ‚Üí [0, ‚àû), so that c(x, y) is the cost of transporting one shipment of iron from x to y. For simplicity, we ignore the time taken to do the transporting. We also assume that each mine can supply only one factory (no splitting of shipments) and that each factory requires precisely one shipment to be in operation (factories cannot work at half- or double-capacity). Having made the above assumptions, a transport plan is a bijection T : M ‚Üí F. In other words, each mine m ‚àà M supplies precisely one factory T(m) ‚àà F and each factory is supplied by precisely one mine. We wish to find the optimal transport plan, the plan T whose total cost :c(T) := \\\\sum_{m \\\\in M} c(m, T(m)) is the least of all possible transport plans from M to F. This motivating special case of the transportation problem is an instance of the assignment problem. More specifically, it is equivalent to finding a minimum weight matching in a bipartite graph. =Moving books: the importance of the cost function= The following simple example illustrates the importance of the cost function in determining the optimal transport plan. Suppose that we have n books of equal width on a shelf (the real line), arranged in a single contiguous block. We wish to rearrange them into another contiguous block, but shifted one book-width to the right. Two obvious candidates for the optimal transport plan present themselves: # move all n books one book-width to the right (\\"many small moves\\"); # move the left-most book n book-widths to the right and leave all other books fixed (\\"one big move\\"). If the cost function is proportional to Euclidean distance (c(x, y) = Œ±x ‚àí y) then these two candidates are both optimal. If, on the other hand, we choose the strictly convex cost function proportional to the square of Euclidean distance (c(x, y) = Œ±x ‚àí y2), then the \\"many small moves\\" option becomes the unique minimizer. Hitchcock problem The following transportation problem formulation is credited to F. L. Hitchcock:Frank L. Hitchcock (1941) \\"The distribution of a product from several sources to numerous localities\\", MIT Journal of Mathematics and Physics 20:224‚Äì230 . :Suppose there are m sources x_1, ... x_m for a commodity, with a(x_i) units of supply at xi and n sinks y_1, ... y_n for the commodity, with the demand b(y_j) at yj. If a(x_i,\\\\ y_j) is the unit cost of shipment from xi to yj, find a flow that satisfies demand from supplies and minimizes the flow cost. This challenge in logistics was taken up by D. R. FulkersonD. R. Fulkerson (1956) Hitchcock Transportation Problem, RAND corporation. and in the book Flows in Networks (1962) written with L. R. Ford Jr..L. R. Ford Jr. & D. R. Fulkerson (1962) ¬ß 3.1 in Flows in Networks, page 95, Princeton University Press Tjalling Koopmans is also credited with formulations of transport economics and allocation of resources. Abstract formulation of the problem =Monge and Kantorovich formulations= The transportation problem as it is stated in modern or more technical literature looks somewhat different because of the development of Riemannian geometry and measure theory. The mines-factories example, simple as it is, is a useful reference point when thinking of the abstract case. In this setting, we allow the possibility that we may not wish to keep all mines and factories open for business, and allow mines to supply more than one factory, and factories to accept iron from more than one mine. Let X and Y be two separable metric spaces such that any probability measure on X (or Y) is a Radon measure (i.e. they are Radon spaces). Let c : X √ó Y ‚Üí [0, ‚àû] be a Borel-measurable function. Given probability measures Œº on X and ŒΩ on Y, Monge's formulation of the optimal transportation problem is to find a transport map T : X ‚Üí Y that realizes the infimum :\\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\int_{X} c(x, T(x)) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (x) \\\\;\\\\right \\\\; T_* (\\\\mu) = u \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where T‚àó(Œº) denotes the push forward of Œº by T. A map T that attains this infimum (i.e. makes it a minimum instead of an infimum) is called an \\"optimal transport map\\". Monge's formulation of the optimal transportation problem can be ill-posed, because sometimes there is no T satisfying T‚àó(Œº) = ŒΩ: this happens, for example, when Œº is a Dirac measure but ŒΩ is not. We can improve on this by adopting Kantorovich's formulation of the optimal transportation problem, which is to find a probability measure Œ≥ on X √ó Y that attains the infimum :\\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\int_{X \\\\times Y} c(x, y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma (x, y) \\\\right \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma (\\\\mu, u) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where Œì(Œº, ŒΩ) denotes the collection of all probability measures on X √ó Y with marginals Œº on X and ŒΩ on Y. It can be shownL. Ambrosio, N. Gigli & G. Savar√©. Gradient Flows in Metric Spaces and in the Space of Probability Measures. Lectures in Mathematics ETH Z√ºrich, Birkh√§user Verlag, Basel. (2005) that a minimizer for this problem always exists when the cost function c is lower semi-continuous and Œì(Œº, ŒΩ) is a tight collection of measures (which is guaranteed for Radon spaces X and Y). (Compare this formulation with the definition of the Wasserstein metric W1 on the space of probability measures.) A gradient descent formulation for the solution of the Monge‚ÄìKantorovich problem was given by Sigurd Angenent, Steven Haker, and Allen Tannenbaum. =Duality formula= The minimum of the Kantorovich problem is equal to :\\\\sup \\\\left( \\\\int_X \\\\varphi (x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (x) + \\\\int_Y \\\\psi (y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} u (y) \\\\right), where the supremum runs over all pairs of bounded and continuous functions \\\\varphi : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{R} and \\\\psi : Y \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{R} such that :\\\\varphi (x) + \\\\psi (y) \\\\leq c(x, y). Solution of the problem =Optimal transportation on the real line= For 1 \\\\leq p < \\\\infty, let \\\\mathcal{P}_p(\\\\mathbf{R}) denote the collection of probability measures on \\\\mathbf{R} that have finite p-th moment. Let \\\\mu, u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}_p(\\\\mathbf{R}) and let c(x, y) = h(x-y), where h:\\\\mathbf{R} \\\\rightarrow [0,\\\\infty) is a convex function. # If \\\\mu has no atom, i.e., if the cumulative distribution function F_\\\\mu = \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\rightarrow[0,1] of \\\\mu is a continuous function, then F_{ u}^{-1} \\\\circ F_{\\\\mu} : \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R} is an optimal transport map. It is the unique optimal transport map if h is strictly convex. # We have ::\\\\min_{\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma(\\\\mu, u)} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^2} c(x, y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\gamma (x, y) = \\\\int_0^1 c \\\\left( F_{\\\\mu}^{-1} (s), F_{ u}^{-1} (s) \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} s. The proof of this solution appears in.Rachev, Svetlozar T., and Ludger R√ºschendorf. Mass Transportation Problems: Volume I: Theory. Vol. 1. Springer, 1998. =Separable Hilbert spaces= Let X be a separable Hilbert space. Let \\\\mathcal{P}_p(X) denote the collection of probability measures on X such that have finite p-th moment; let \\\\mathcal{P}_p^r(X) denote those elements \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}_p(X) that are Gaussian regular: if g is any strictly positive Gaussian measure on X and g(N) = 0, then \\\\mu(N) = 0 also.

Then the Kantorovich problem has a unique solution \\\\kappa, and this solution is induced by an optimal transport map: i.e., there exists a Borel map r\\\\in L^p(X, \\\\mu; X) such that :\\\\kappa = (\\\\mathrm{id}_X \\\\times r)_{*} (\\\\mu) \\\\in \\\\Gamma (\\\\mu, u). Moreover, if u has bounded support, then :r(x) = x -  abla \\\\varphi (x) ^{q - 2} abla \\\\varphi (x) for \\\\mu-almost all x\\\\in X for some locally Lipschitz, c-concave and maximal Kantorovich potential \\\\varphi.

After the looting of Hamburg by Vikings, in 845, the archbishopric of Hamburg was united with the bishopric of Bremen, and the archbishop's seat was moved to Bremen. Still, there was a cathedral chapter in Hamburg with several special rights, which started to build St. Mary's Cathedral. The incumbents of the Hamburg-Bremen see are usually titled Archbishop of Hamburg and Bishop of Bremen between 848 and 1072, however, some later archbishops continued the tradition of naming both dioceses until 1258. During the Reformation the bishopric underwent steady deterioration and finally, with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, it ceased to exist. By the apostolic constitution Omnium Christifidelium of Pope John Paul II, of October 24, 1994 coming into effect on January 7, 1995, the archdiocese of Hamburg was erected again.

Creation =Casting= Creator Tony Warren originally had Betty Alberge in mind for the part of Ida when writing the first scripts, but when Alberge auditioned everyone agreed she was more suited to the role of shopkeeper Florrie Lindley, leaving auditions for Ida wide open until Noel Dyson was found. =Background= Ida Leathers was born in 1916 to Nancy Leathers (Norah Hammond). Ida grew up to be a soft, caring, almost saintly woman and married the love of her life Frank Barlow (Frank Pemberton) in 1938. They went on to have two sons - Kenneth (William Roache) in 1939, and David (Alan Rothwell) in 1942, and thus Ida found her new place in life as housewife and relished it. She spent most of her time looking after her family and keeping the house running, rarely socialising in the Rovers at all. Storylines Ida was the perfect housewife and doted on Frank and her boys. Ida had a special friendship with the Barlows' next-door neighbour, Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth), and visited him on a regular basis, unlike his daughter Beattie Pearson (Gabrielle Daye), which sometimes caused friction between the two women (or at least disparaging comments from Beattie), despite Ida's calm nature. Ida's mother Nancy Leathers (Norah Hammond) moved into No.3 in 1961, due to her failing health, and no-one expected her to outlive her daughter. One day when Ida was visiting Beattie, concern grew when Ida never arrived. Later that day, Frank learned that Ida had been hit by the bus she was intending to catch and died. Ida's funeral episode saw a new peak in viewing figures for Coronation Street, with 15.6 million viewers tuning in. Development =Departure and death= It was announced that Noel Dyson had quit the role of Ida, after less than a year, and that she was tired of playing her. It was then confirmed that the character would be killed off to increase viewing numbers. Ida was struck by a bus and Frank Barlow was devastated. Dyson played Ida in 41 episodes overall. Her final appearance was in episode 77; although no death scene was shown and the events of her death unfolded on-screen from the next episode onwards.

Cryoablation is performed using hollow needles (cryoprobes) through which cooled, thermally conductive, fluids are circulated. Cryoprobes are positioned adjacent to the target in such a way that the freezing process will destroy the diseased tissue. Once the probes are in place, the attached cryogenic freezing unit removes heat from (\\"cools\\") the tip of the probe and by extension from the surrounding tissues. Ablation occurs in tissue that has been frozen by at least three mechanisms: # formation of ice crystals within cells thereby disrupting membranes, and interrupting cellular metabolism among other processes; # coagulation of blood thereby interrupting bloodflow to the tissue in turn causing ischemia and cell death; and # induction of apoptosis, the so-called programmed cell death cascade. The most common application of cryoablation is to ablate solid tumors found in the lung, liver, breast, kidney and prostate. The use in prostate and renal cryoablation are the most common. Although sometimes applied in cryosurgery through laparoscopic or open surgical approaches, most often cryoablation is performed percutaneously (through the skin and into the target tissue containing the tumor) by a medical specialist, such as an interventional radiologist. The term is from cryo- + ablation. Prostate Prostate cryoablation is moderately effective but, as with any prostate removal process, also can result in impotence. Prostate cryoablation is used in three patient categories: # as primary therapy in patients for whom sexual function is less important or who are poor candidates for radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP, surgical removal of the prostate); # as salvage therapy in patients who have failed brachytherapy (the use of implanted radioactive \\"seeds\\" placed within the prostate) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT); and # focal therapy for smaller, discrete tumors in younger patients.  Bone cancer  Cryoablation has been explored as an alternative to radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in people with metastatic bone disease. The area of tissue destruction created by this technique can be monitored more effectively by CT than RFA, a potential advantage when treating tumors adjacent to critical structures. Renal Cryoablation has similar outcomes to radiofrequency ablation when treating renal cell carcinoma. Breast cancer Cryoablation for breast cancer is typically only possible for small tumors. Often surgery is used following cryoablation. As of 2014 more research is required before it can replace lumpectomy. Cardiac Another type of cryoablation is used to restore normal electrical conduction by freezing tissue or heart pathways that interfere with the normal distribution of the heart‚Äôs electrical impulses. Cryoablation is used in two types of intervention for the treatment of arrhythmias: (1) catheter-based procedures and (2) surgical operations. A catheter is a very thin tube that is inserted into a vein in the patient‚Äôs leg and threaded to the heart where it delivers energy to treat the patient‚Äôs arrhythmia. In surgical procedures, a flexible probe is used directly on an exposed heart to apply the energy that interrupts the arrhythmia. By cooling the tip of a cryoablation catheter (cardiology) or probe (heart surgery) to sub-zero temperatures, the cells in the heart responsible for conducting the arrhythmia are altered so that they no longer conduct electrical impulses. Fibroadenoma Cryoablation is also currently being used to treat fibroadenomas of the breast. Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that are found in approximately 10% of women (primarily ages 15‚Äì30).Medical Dictionary In this procedure which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an ultrasound-guided probe is inserted into the fibroadenoma and extremely cold temperatures are then used to destroy the abnormal cells.WebMD ‚Äì Cryotherapy Shrinks Benign Breast Lumps Over time the cells are reabsorbed into the body. The procedure can be performed in a doctor's office setting with local anesthesia and leaves very little scarring compared to open surgical procedures.  Catheter-based procedures  Different catheter-based ablation techniques may be used and they generally fall into two categories: (1) cold-based procedures where tissue cooling is used to treat the arrhythmia, and (2) heat-based procedures where high temperature is used to alter the abnormal conductive tissue in the heart. = Cryoablation = Cold temperatures are used in cryoablation to chill or freeze cells that conduct abnormal heart rhythms. The catheter removes heat from the tissue to cool it to temperatures as low as -75 ¬∞C. This causes localized scarring, which cuts undesired conduction paths. This is a much newer treatment for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) involving the atrioventicular (AV) node directly. SVT involving the AV node is often a contraindication for using radiofrequency ablation because of the risk of injuring the AV node, forcing patients to receive a permanent pacemaker. With cryoablation, areas of tissue can be mapped by limited, reversible, freezing (e.g., to -10 C). If the result is undesirable, the tissue can be rewarmed without permanent damage. Otherwise, the tissue can be permanently ablated by freezing it to a lower temperature (e.g., -73 C). This therapy has revolutionized AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and other AV nodal tachyarrhythmias. It has allowed people who were otherwise not a candidate for radiofrequency ablation to have a chance at having their problem cured. This technology was developed at The Montreal Heart Institute in the late 1990s. The therapy was successfully adopted in Europe in 2001, and in the US in 2004 following the \\"Frosty Trial\\". In 2004, the technology was pioneered in the midwest United States at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio by Mark Krebs, MD, FACC, Matthew Hoskins, RN, BSN and Ken Peterman, RN, BSN. These electrophysiology experts were successful in curing the first 12 candidates in their facility. Cryoablation for AVNRT and other arrhythmias do have some drawbacks. A recent studyNov. 2010 German CYRANO study (Cryoablation Versus Radiofrequency Energy for the Ablation of Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia) concluded that procedure times are slightly higher on average for cryoablation than for traditional radio- frequency (heat-based) ablations. Also, higher rate of equipment failures were recorded using this technique. Finally, even though short term success rate is equivalent to RF treatments, cryoablation appears to have a significantly higher long term recurrence rate.  Site testing  Cryotherapy is able to produce a temporary electrical block by cooling down the tissue believed to be conducting the arrhythmia. This allows the physician to make sure this is the right site before permanently disabling it. The ability to test a site in this way is referred to as site testing or cryomapping. When ablating tissue near the AV node (a special conduction center that carries electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles), there is a risk of producing heart block ‚Äì that is, normal conduction from the atria cannot be transmitted to the ventricles. Freezing tissue near the AV node is less likely to provoke irreversible heart block than ablating it with heat.  Surgical procedures  As in catheter- based procedures, techniques using heating or cooling temperatures may be used to treat arrhythmias during heart surgery. Techniques also exist where incisions are used in the open heart to interrupt abnormal electrical conduction (Maze procedure). Cryosurgery involves the use of freezing techniques for the treatment of arrhythmias during surgery. A physician may recommend cryosurgery being used during the course of heart surgery as a secondary procedure to treat any arrhythmia that was present or that may appear during the primary openchest procedure. The most common heart operations in which cryosurgery may be used in this way are mitral valve repairs and coronary artery bypass grafting. During the procedure, a flexible cryoprobe is placed on or around the heart and delivers cold energy that disables tissue responsible for conducting the arrhythmia.  Vascular Malformations  Cryoablation has recently been used to treat low-flow vascular malformations such as venous malformations (VM) and fibroadipose vascular anomalies (FAVA). Cryoablation has proved effective for treating these disorders both as primary treatment and after sclerotherapy. Cryoimmunotherapy Cryoimmunotherapy is an oncological treatment for various cancers that combines cryoablation of tumor with immunotherapy treatment. In-vivo cryoablation of a tumor, alone, can induce an immunostimulatory, systemic anti-tumor response, resulting in a cancer vaccine ‚Äì the abscopal effect.With improvements in breast imaging and image-guided interventions, there is interest in ablative techniques for breast cancer. Cryosurgery initiates inflammation and leaves tumor-specific antigens intact, which may induce an anti-tumor immune response. However, cryoablation alone may produce an insufficient immune response, depending on various factors, such as high freeze rate. Combining cryotherapy with immunotherapy enhances the immunostimulating response and has synergistic effects for cancer treatment. History The use of cold for pain relief and as an anti- inflammatory has been known since the time of Hippocrates (460‚Äì377 BC). Since then there have been numerous accounts of ice used for pain relief including from the Ancient Egyptians and Avicenna of Persia (AD 982‚Äì1070). Since 1899, Dr. Campbell White used refrigerants for treating a variety of conditions, including: lupus erythematosus, herpes zoster, chancroid, naevi, warts, varicose leg ulcers, carbuncles, carcinomas and epitheliomas. De Quervain successfully used of carbonic snow to treat bladder papillomas and bladder cancers in 1917. Dr. Irving S. Cooper, in 1913, progressed the field of cryotherapy by designing a liquid nitrogen probe capable of achieving temperatures of -196 ¬∞C, and utilizing it to treat of Parkinson's disease and previously inoperable cancer. Cooper's cryoprobe advanced the practice of cryotherapy, which led to growing interest and practice of cryotherapy. In 1964, Dr. Cahan successfully used his liquid nitrogen probe invention to treat uterine fibroids and cervical cancer. Cryotherapy continued to advance with Dr. Amoils developing a liquid nitrogen probe capable of achieving cooling expansion, in 1967. With the technological cryoprobe advancements in the 1960s, came wider acceptance and practice of cryotherapy. Since the 1960s, liver, prostate, breast, bone, and other cancers were being treated with cryoablation in many parts of the world. Japanese physician Dr. Tanaka began treating metastatic breast cancer cryoablation in 1968. For the next three decades, Dr. Tanaka successfully treated small and localized as well as advanced and unresectable breast cancer with minimally invasive cryoablation. All of Dr. Tanaka's breast cancer cases were considered incurable: advanced, unresectable, and resistant to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. At the same time, physicians, including Dr. Ablin and Dr. Gage, started utilizing cryoablation for the treatment of prostate and bone cancer. Dr. Paul J. Wang MD and Dr. Peter L. Friedman MD, PhD invented cryoablation for the heart and cardiac arrhythmia in 1988. Their patents were for the cryoablation catheter and cryogenic mapping (US Patents 5147355A and 5423807A). The 1980s and 1990s saw dramatic advancement in apparatus and imaging techniques, with the introduction of CMS Cryoprobe, and Accuprobe. CT, MRI, ultrasound guided cryoprobes became available and improved the capabilities of cryoprobes in treatment. Excited by the latest advancements in cryotherapy, China embraced cryotherapy in the 1990s, to treat many oncological conditions.Tumor treatment through cryotherapy was first invented by Americans in the 1960s. Aimed at promoting the new technology, the ISC was founded in Austria in 1972. The technology matured with each passing day after over 30 years of development. In recent years, in particular, China, with its greater economic development and scientific and technological progress, has been playing a leading role in the world in terms of both theoretical research and clinical application of cryotherapy. As an efficient medical method for treating tumors, cryotherapy has been adopted by more and more medical institutions in China and has achieved remarkable cancer-treating effectiveness. With the benefits well-established, the FDA approved the treatment of prostate cancer with cryoablation in 1998.

First appearing in Yarrowstalks (1967), the character gained a following during the emergence of underground comix in the 1960s and 1970s, and has been extensively merchandised in various products.  Publication history  When he settled in San Francisco in 1967, Crumb began drawing LSD-inspired comics. The first Mr. Natural strip, \\"Mr. Natural: The Zen Master\\", appeared in the premiere issue of the Philadelphia-based underground newspaper Yarrowstalks on 5 May 1967. When editor Brian Zahn proposed to Crumb to fill the entire third issue with his comix, Crumb created Flakey Foont and several other characters. Mr. Natural made appearances in other underground newspapers such as the East Village Other, which published the strips \\"Mr. Natural Meets God\\" and \\"Mr. Natural Repents\\" among others. He made his first official comix appearance in Zap Comix #1 (Feb. 1968). Mr. Natural also appeared in early underground comix titles like Bijou Funnies, and Yellow Dog. He was a regular in Zap for the balance of the 1960s until appearing in his own three-issue title, originally co-published by The San Francisco Comic Book Company and Apex Novelties. Crumb created original Mr. Natural strips for The Village Voice from February 2, 1976, to November 29, 1976, which were first collected in Mr. Natural #3 (Kitchen Sink Press, 1977). After a ten-year hiatus, Mr. Natural returned in the pages of Crumb's solo series, Hup (Last Gasp), and then after another gap, in Mystic Funnies #1 (Alex Wood, 1997). The character hasn't made a new appearance since 2002. Mr. Natural's various appearances were collected in The Complete Crumb Comics vol. 4, \\"Mr. Sixties!\\" (Fantagraphics, 1989), The Book of Mr. Natural (Fantagraphics, 1995), as well as The Complete Crumb Comics vol. 11, \\"Mr. Natural Committed to a Mental Institution!\\" (Fantagraphics, 1995).  Characterization  At first appearance, Mr. Natural is a mystic guru who spouts aphorisms on the evils of the modern world and the salvation to be found in mysticism and natural living. He has renounced the material world and lives off anything he can get in exchange for his nuggets of wisdom. Usually depicted as slightly overweight (although his size varies), he is bald with a long white beard, and wears a gown which makes him resemble \\"old man\\" depictions of God or a prophet. Crumb's bearded guru is too unapologetic to be called a con man. Despite his renunciation of the material world, he is an unrepentant sybarite. His straight talk, while refreshing, can get him into trouble, as when he was kicked out of heaven for telling God it's \\"a little corny\\" in \\"Mr. Natural Meets God\\".R. Crumb's Head Comix (Viking Press, November 1968). But he may be the only Crumb creation who is genuinely likable.Burgess, Steve, \\"R. Crumb\\", Salon (May 2, 2000) Mr. Natural's advice is seemingly at odds with his image as a sage, and his inventions are at once brilliant and crackpot.Varnum, Robin and Gibbons, Christina, The Language of Comics Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2001 p. 111. Perhaps Mr. Natural's most famous aphorism is, \\"Mr. Natural sez, Use the right tool for the job\\" ‚Äî spoken on seeing Flakey Foont unloading a truck full of bowling balls with a pitchfork. Asked, \\"What does it all mean?\\", he responds, \\"Don't mean sheeit...\\" Mr. Natural has strange, magical powers and possesses cosmic insight; but he is also moody, cynical, self-pitying, and suffers from various strange sexual obsessions. He is endlessly being accosted by would-be disciples seeking the truth (among them such long-running Crumb characters as Flakey Foont and Shuman the Human). He typically regards them with amused condescension and a certain grudging affection, although his patience often wears thin and he takes sadistic pleasure in making them feel like idiots. While he is typically very cool and in control, he sometimes ends up in humiliating predicaments like languishing for years in a mental institution.Crumb, R. \\"Untitled,\\" The Village Voice (Oct. 18, 1976); later republished in The Complete Crumb volume 11: Mr. Natural Committed to a Mental Institution! (Fantagraphics, 1995). According to a biography written and illustrated by Crumb, \\"Fred Natural\\" had been a jazz musician and then faith healer in the 1920s,Crumb, R. \\" \\"The Origins of Mr. Natural,\\" Mr. Natural #1 (San Francisco Comic Book Company, Aug. 1970) which would mean that he was \\"born\\" in the early years of the 20th century, and by the time of his first encounters (set in the San Francisco area) in the 1960s, was a 60-year-old man. However, in Crumb's illustration of the 1920s faith healer, Fred Natural looks approximately fifty, which would make him one hundred years old in the earliest Flakey Foont encounters. Mr. Natural's own father is featured in a 1973 Zap story, where he is represented as a rugged frontier type living in a rundown tenement-style apartment building.untitled [\\"I'm taking you to see my ol' man...\\"], Zap Comix #6 (Print Mint, 1973). In the \\"biography\\", \\"Fred Natural\\" leaves America and travels for many years in Asia, which is where he picks up his unique combination of wisdom and chicanery. For a time he worked as a taxicab driver in Afghanistan.Crumb, R. The Book of Mr. Natural, Fantagraphics Books (December 27, 1995) p.5 He returns to the U.S during the Beat era of the 1960s, and is drawn to the San Francisco Bay area by nubile girls and people willing to listen and pay for his improvisational spirituality. He exhorts his disciples to eat only his own line of \\"Mr. Natural Brand Foods\\", and to listen to his broadcasts on the fictional WZAP Radio. A theme in Mr. Natural is the inability of generations in the United States to connect, with each generation rejecting the one before it. Mr. Natural is a \\"grandfather,\\" and not a \\"father,\\" to the clueless Foont. In one strip, Mr. Natural's father finds Foont so decadent that he attacks him. In the 1980s and 1990s he entered into a tempestuous relationship with Devil Girl, another popular Crumb character.  Inspiration  Barry Miles writes that Mr. Natural is a lampoon of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.Miles, Barry, Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, Macmillan, 1998 p.401 In the film Comic Book Confidential, Crumb says that he was inspired to draw the character when he heard then radio DJ David Rubenstein, jokingly calling himself \\"Mr. Natural\\".Mann, Ron, director. Comic Book Confidential (Cinecom Pictures, 1988). A conscious model for Mr. Natural would be various louche and disreputable Great Depression survivors who'd gone through the Second World War in various capacities such as war correspondent, and who'd volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War, only to discover, in the McCarthy era of the 1950s, that their background made them unemployable and who developed various sorts of scams to prey upon the postwar Baby Boomers' search for enlightenment. Crumb has acknowledged that one inspiration for Mr. Natural was a character called The Little Hitchhiker from a comic strip called The Squirrel Cage by Gene Ahern, which ran from 1936‚Äì1953. An homage is sometimes read into this. Mr. Natural also somewhat resembles an E. C. Segar character, Dr. O.G. Wotasnozzle. Mr. Natural's one-piece yellow outfit bears a resemblance to Richard F. Outcault's early comic strip The Yellow Kid.  In popular culture  In 1973 a pornographic film called Up in Flames was made, featuring Mr. Natural and Gilbert Shelton's Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. The film was made without the knowledge or permission of Crumb or Shelton. Mr. Natural appeared, unauthorized, stamped on the blotter paper of a popular form of LSD in the 1970s. A Martin Rowson cartoon in the July 24, 2008, edition of The Guardian featured the recently arrested Radovan Karad≈æiƒá in the guise of Mr. Natural. In the Breaking Bad season 5 episode \\"Confessions\\", the criminal lawyer Saul Goodman calls Jesse Pinkman \\"Mr. Natural\\" upon Jesse lighting a joint in Saul's office. On the television sitcom, Raising Hope, a recurring outfit for the main character Jimmy Chance, was a \\"Mr. Natural\\" T-shirt.

She later backed these claims with evidence that she had reported sexual harassment of trainees to the College and that the reports were ignored . The original comments were highly provocative and controversial, but have led to major changes at the RACS . In 2016, the RACS formed an official Diversity and Inclusion plan .

Third contribution on Rovno amber silken fungus beetles: a new Eocene species of Cryptophagus (Coleoptera, Clavicornia, Cryptophagidae). ZooKeys (130), 255-61. Like most of the other beetles in the family, these are fungivores, feeding on fungal spores and hyphae.Cryptophagus spp. Canadian Grain Commission. 2013. These beetles are flattened and oval in shape, and are generally 2 to 3 millimeters long. They are reddish to dark brown, sometimes with yellowish patterns on the elytra. The thorax is often sculptured with teeth, angles, or other projections. Some are hairy. The larva is usually yellow-brown and cylindrical but flattened, with visible legs. Some species are considered pests when they inhabit stores of grain, flour, bread, dried fruit, and other products, however, the beetles feed on fungi growing on the food product rather than the product itself. They also breed in the fungi, laying eggs in the hyphae. They are more common in products that are damp and moldy. The beetles can transmit fungal spores to products, encouraging mold growth. In Canada the beetles are common in the grain-producing prairie regions. These beetles can be found in other habitats where fungi are available, such as beehives, the nests of other hymenopterans such as wasps and ants, rodent nests, and wool.Lyubarsky, G. Y. and E. E.

Its flagship station is La Voz de Bogot√° since 2017. Radio Continental, also in Bogot√°, had this role until 2016, having joined Todelar (an acronym of the last names of its founder) in 1957. As of 2015, the flagship morning news programme, Artunduaga por la ma√±ana, was directed by journalist √âdgar Artunduaga. The programme was cancelled December 2016, a few weeks before Radio Continental was sold to Cadena Radial Vida, a network owned by an evangelical group whose leader is Eduardo Ca√±as.  History  Bernardo Tob√≥n de la Roche was the manager of Radio Pac√≠fico, a station in Cali affiliated to RCN Radio, and had founded La Voz de Pereira in the 1940s. After a congress of radio stations in 1956, Tob√≥n de la Roche was able to secure affiliations for his network from stations of Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Cartagena de Indias. By 1962 Todelar had 24 stations (11 owned-and-operated, 13 affiliates). In 1967 Uni√≥n Radio, a group of radio stations of Cali (Radio Uno, Radio el Sol), Pereira (La Voz Amiga, La Voz de Pereira), and Bogot√° (La Voz de Bogot√°, Emisora Monserrate), joined the network. De la Roche's brothers Jaime and Jairo, who also were part of the network, would leave and became executives of rival networks Caracol Radio and RCN Radio, respectively. Todelar had its golden era in the 1960s and 1970s, broadcasting live sports events such as the Vuelta a Colombia, and the 1966 FIFA World Cup, or radioplays like La ley contra el hampa, a crime drama, or the Colombian version of the Mexican hit Kalim√°n.; some of these dramas were broadcast from Cali and lasted into the mid 1990s. Todelar would later expand to FM. In 1977, Todelar had 344 stations. After these years, Todelar has seen itself in disadvantage vis-√†-vis rival networks RCN Radio and Caracol Radio, being in a slow decline since the 1990s; since Todelar is essentially a media company it has found difficult to compete in equal terms with those networks, owned by huge corporate conglomerates (Organizaci√≥n Ardila L√ºlle and PRISA, respectively). Some stations have left the network (including main flagship Radio Continental in 2017) and some timeslots, specially in the AM stations, are filled with paid programmes by shamans, naturist medicine laboratories and esoteric or religious groups since the late 1980s.  Main networks  *Circuito Todelar de Colombia: the main network, broadcasting news, sports, and events. Its flagship station is La Voz de Bogot√°. Until 2017, the flagship station was Radio Continental. *La Z: devoted to salsa music; its format is as 2015 preserved only by the Cali affiliate, HJBT. The Bogot√° station (HJST) changed to a Latin pop format and the Medell√≠n station (HJTO) broadcasts reggaeton. *La 92 (HJST): devoted to pop (mainly in Spanish, with some English-language songs) and reggaeton; it simulcasts √âdgar Artunduaga's morning news programme.

After six seasons at Rugby ParkKilmarnock player Cunningham, Andy, FitbaStats he joined Rangers in 1915. He made his Rangers debut on 5 April 1915 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Partick Thistle, and made five appearances in his first season at Ibrox. Cunningham served as a lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery during the First World War. Cunningham continued to be used infrequently by manager William Wilton before establishing himself in the Rangers team in 1918‚Äì19. He won seven League titles and played in Rangers' famous 1928 Scottish Cup Final triumph where they defeated Celtic 4‚Äì0 to win the trophy for the first time in 25 years.

Cunningham also represented the Scottish League XI 10 times. Managerial career Cunningham moved to Newcastle United in 1928, becoming the then oldest player to make his debut in the English football League at the age of thirty-eight. He began his Newcastle career as player/manager and then went on to become full-time manager of the club after retiring from playing. Technically, he was the first true manager of the club, as his predecessor Frank Watt had no control over team selection. He guided the club to FA Cup success in 1932 after beating Arsenal 2‚Äì1 in the final. However, the club was also relegated to the Second Division whilst he was at the helm. Cunningham eventually left the club in 1935. He is remembered as a moderately successful manager of the club, having won 105 games out of 251. After his time with Newcastle, he returned to Scotland where he managed Dundee between 1937 and 1940 before becoming a sports writer after World War II.

The children denied that any abuse had occurred, and medical examinations did not reveal any evidence of abuse. Background The father of a family was imprisoned in 1986 shortly after the family's arrival in South Ronaldsay, for child abuse. No formal child protection proceedings were initiated. After an alarm raised by officials in a neighbouring authority, sparked by a girl's claim to social workers and police that ritualistic satanic abuse had taken place, action was taken. Other children were taken in late 1990, and the two youngest were told that their mother was dead. Local people began a campaign for the children to be allowed home. It was repeatedly decided that their welfare could not be assured in the care of their mother. It took six years before the last of the children was returned to their mother. After consultations among police, social workers, and local officers of the Royal Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and after receiving legal authority from Scotland's most senior sheriff, pre-dawn raids were made on the houses of the minister and the families who had assisted his campaign. Following a community meeting, many of the parents organised a support group, the South Ronaldsay Parents Action Committee, led by a local doctor, and assisted by the voluntary organisation Parents Against Injustice (PAIN). The group collected petitions of support that showed overwhelming scepticism about the charges.Jenkins, p. 186 Court case The case came to court in April, and after a single day the presiding judge, Sheriff David Kelbie, dismissed the case as fatally flawed and the children were allowed to return home. The judge criticised the social workers involved, saying that their handling of the case had been \\"fundamentally flawed\\" and he found in summary that \\"these proceedings are so fatally flawed as to be incompetent\\" and that the children concerned had been separated and subjected to repeated cross-examinations almost as if the aim was to force confessions rather than to assist in therapy. Where two children made similar statements about abuse this appeared to be the result of \\"repeated coaching\\". He added that in his view \\"There is no lawful authority for that whatsoever\\". Sheriff Kelbie also said that he was unclear what the supposed evidence provided by the social services proved. The children were returned by plane to Kirkwall airport on 4 April 1991 where they were reunited with their parents. The Reporter appealed against the dismissal of the case and on 12 June 1991, the Court of Session, sitting as Scotland's premier civil appeal court, upheld the appeal, stating that the Sheriff had \\"allowed himself to form views about the contents [of the social workers' evidence that] would have made it impossible for him to bring a fair and balanced judgement to the issues\\".The Independent, \\"The Orkney Inquiry: 'Reporter' is central figure in emotional saga\\", Wednesday, 28 October 1992 The case was remitted back to the sheriff court to proceed. The Reporter took the view that in the light of factors including the publicity since Kelbie's decision, the case was severely compromised. The application was formally abandoned. The objects seized during the raids were later returned; they included a videotape of the TV show Blackadder, a detective novel by Ngaio Marsh, and a model aeroplane made by one of the children from two pieces of wood, which was identified by social workers as a \\"wooden cross\\". The minister was asked to sign for the return of \\"three masks, two hoods, one black cloak\\", but refused to sign until the inventory was altered to \\"three nativity masks, two academic hoods, one priest's robe\\". Inquiry The controversy resulted in an official inquiry established in August 1991, chaired by Lord Clyde. The inquiry published its report in October 1992. It described the successful appeal against the first judgement as \\"most unfortunate\\" and criticized all those involved, including the social workers, the police, and the Orkney Islands Council. Social workers' training, methods, and judgement were given special condemnation, and the report stated that the concept of \\"ritual abuse\\" was \\"not only unwarrantable at present but may affect the objectivity of practitioners and parents\\".Bennett, p. 287 Causes Liz McLean, the social worker who led the interviews with the children, had also been involved in the 1990 Rochdale \\"Satanic Abuse\\" case. She was later sharply criticised by Lord Clyde in the official inquiry into the South Ronaldsay case, and in another investigation into similar allegations in Ayrshire. =Interviewing techniques= During the investigation the children received several lengthy interviews. McLean was later described by several of the children as a terrifying figure who was \\"fixated on finding satanic abuse\\", and other children described how she urged them to draw circles and faces, presumably as evidence indicating abusive rites. These techniques were strongly criticised by Sheriff Kelbie. One of the children later said of the interviews: \\"In order to get out of a room, after an hour or so of saying, 'No, this never happened', you'd break down.\\" One of the children later said: Media In 1992, an episode of the TV show Rumpole of the Bailey dealt with the Satanic Abuse hysteria. Called 'Rumpole and the Children of the Devil', it dealt with a panic over children, including leading questioning of them, wild accusations and taking of the children into care. It was inspired by the Orkney case, and earlier cases. On 22 August 2006 a documentary on the case titled Accused produced by Blast! Films was transmitted by BBC2. The programme included dramatic reconstructions of some of the interviews conducted with the children by social workers, and allowed participants in the affair - including the children - to speak for themselves. Victim lawsuit In September 2006 it was announced that one person, who had been 8 years old when she was taken into care by social workers in November 1990, intended to sue the council. She said that she had been the victim of a \\"witch hunt\\" by overzealous social workers determined to break up her family. She said that the interview techniques used at the time were designed to break the children down, and that she was bribed with sweets to tell social workers what they wanted to hear. In February 2008 it was reported that she would receive legal aid to sue the Council.

They have often been cited, alongside fellow Belgian band Front 242, as the pioneers of electronic body music (EBM), an electronic dance genre from the early 1980s combining industrial and electro music. History Dirk Da Davo and TB Frank combined minimalist industrial drones and new wave synthpop and dance music, with cold, mechanical rhythms. Their early work was aggressive, danceable and dominated by synthesizers and drum-machines. Later in their career, their work featured prominent guitars. The Neon Judgement recorded most of their output for the Play It Again Sam label in Belgium, beginning with 1986's Mafu Cage. Their first American release came in 1987, with the sex-themed concept album, Horny As Hell. Subsequent recordings included Blood and Thunder (1989), The Insult (1990), and Are You Real (1992). The duo took a three-year hiatus in 1992, returning in 1995 with At Devil's Fork, an LP recorded with percussionist Ben Forceville entirely in a wooded area. The band stopped performing in 1998, but reformed in 2004 and started performing live again to promote a series of remixes and re-releases of their material. The touring continued into 2006, with the band stating on their website that \\"Live, The Neon Judgement will continue to give art terrorism a good name, finding new ways of marrying noise and beauty, machines and magic\\". Dirk Da Davo is also part of the side project Neon Electronics, for which he started his own record label Dancedelic-D and he both reworks old classics and composes new material. In November 2005, the Neon Judgement played at the Machina Festival at the Broadway Club in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The festival celebrated the first eight years of the site FiberOnline and the launch of the label Fiber Records.

Gareth Hughes (23 August 1894 ‚Äì 1 October 1965) was a Welsh stage and silent screen actor. Usually cast as a callow, sensitive hero in Hollywood silent films, Hughes got his start on stage during childhood and continued to play youthful leads on Broadway.  Biography  Born William John Hughes into a working-class family in Dafen, Carmarthenshire, after working with a number of UK touring companies he joined a group of Welsh players. The group took a tour to the United States, and although not successful Hughes was spotted in Chicago, and stayed in America to pursue his acting career. By the end of 1915, he had become successful on Broadway. This, in turn, led to his involvement in the motion picture business. = Film career = Hughes's earlier screen work was with Clara Kimball Young in Eyes of Youth (1919) and with Marguerite Clark in Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch (1920). He was teamed with Viola Dana in The Chorus Girl's Romance (1920). He signed with Metro Pictures and was loaned to Famous Players Lasky for Sentimental Tommy (1921), probably his best film role. Even though he had already appeared in many films before this, he regarded Sentimental Tommy as his favourite and most successful. He made forty-five films from 1918 to 1931. He was also the Welsh dialect coach on The Corn Is Green (1945) starring Bette Davis. Cecil B. DeMille called him \\"a young idealist\\", and Fulton Oursler described him as \\"the charm boy to end all charm boys\\". = Return to theatre = In 1929, like many others, he lost his fortune in the Wall Street crash and was left penniless, but he carried on making films until 1931 when he appeared in Scareheads. He then decided to leave the world of film and return to theatre, which had always been his first love. His final role ran for 18 weeks at the Hollywood Playhouse in 1938, where he starred as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. = Missionary = In the early 1940s, Hughes experienced a religious calling. Adopting the name of Brother David, in 1944, he became a Christian missionary to the Paiute Indians on the Pyramid Lake Reservation of Nevada. Hughes spent almost 14 years with his \\"children\\", as he called them. = Later years and death = In 1958, Hughes returned to Llanelli to spend his final years. But he longed for the sunshine of the West Coast, and after five months he returned to California. Later, Hughes moved into the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills where he had his own cottage. He baptised silent film actress Clara Kimball Young prior to her death. He died in 1965 of complications from byssinosis, a lint-born respiratory disease he contracted from years of sorting donated clothing at Pyramid Lake, and his cremated remains were buried at the Masonic Memorial Gardens cemetery in Reno, Nevada.  Legacy  In 2000, the first TV documentary on Hughes's life was produced by Nant Films in collaboration with Stephen Lyons, Hughes's biographer. The programme, in Welsh, was broadcast on S4C. In 2008, his relative Kelvin Guy made a film In Search of Gareth Hughes, which has received only limited release. The film has been neither broadcast nor made available for public viewing. In 2000, a bronze plaque to Hughes's memory was mounted in Parc Howard Museum (Llanelli) by Stephen Lyons and Hughes's niece; later the same year, a blue plaque at Hughes's boyhood dwelling on Princess Street in Llanelli was unveiled by members of his family. Stephen Lyons, Llanelli Community Heritage and relative Kelvin Guy are responsible for these tributes to this star of the silent film. The National Library of Wales has designated biographer Stephen Lyons's web site as part of Wales's documentary heritage.

Life Woodward was born in Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland. He trained as an engineer but developed an interest in medieval architecture, producing measured drawings of Holy Cross Abbey in County Tipperary. These drawings were exhibited at the RIBA in London in 1846. The same year he joined the office of Sir Thomas Deane and became a partner in 1851 along with Deane's son, Thomas Newenham Deane. It seems that Deane looked after business matters, and left the design work to Woodward. The billiard-playing monkeys in the Kildare Street Club Woodward's two most important buildings are the Museum at Trinity College, Dublin (1854-1857) and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Oxford, (1854-1860). He was also responsible for the Kildare Street Club in Dublin (1858-1861) and Queen's College Cork, now University College Cork, (1845-1849). The work of Deane and Woodward is characterised by naturalistic decoration with foliage and animals carved into capitals and plinths around windows and doors. It was extolled by John Ruskin in particular when he visited the Museum at Trinity College, Dublin. Woodward collaborated in particular with the O'Shea brothers. James and John O'Shea were stone carvers from County Cork. They, along with London sculptors, carved the abundant decorative stonework at Trinity, showing owls, lizards, cats and monkeys, as well as other flora and fauna. Later the O'Sheas carved stonework at the Kildare Street Club, including the famous window piece showing the club members as monkeys playing billiards. Some stories tell of the O'Sheas getting into trouble and possibly even being sacked for carving cats or monkeys at the Oxford University Museum.

After Yuan Shao's death in 202, Liu Biao once wrote to Yuan Shao's third son and successor, Yuan Shang, and mentioned the rivalry between Yuan Shang and his eldest brother Yuan Tan.

Thus, for almost the entire time that the OAS has been operating, Cuba has been barred from sending representatives to the OAS and effectively had its membership suspended. It was not until 3 June 2009 that foreign ministers of OAS member countries assembled for the OAS's 39th General Assembly in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, passed a vote to lift Cuba's suspension from the OAS. Prerevolution background Cuba was one of the 21 initial members of the OAS upon foundation in Bogot√° on 5 May 1948. The Organization, first led by Colombian Alberto Lleras Camargo, was created \\"to achieve an order of peace and justice, to promote their solidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, and their independence.\\" Post-revolution relations Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, relations between Cuba and the United States began to deteriorate rapidly. Initially, however, the nations that comprised the Organization of American States were reluctant to be drawn on the issue of Cuba's representation at the organization. The United States favored collective action against Cuba with the stated aim, as forwarded by President John F. Kennedy, of isolating Cuba politically and economically. At a meeting of foreign ministers in August 1960, most nations refused to comment on the status of Cuba. Some, like Mexico and Argentina were adamant to remain impartial and stressed that the issue was a private quarrel between Cuba and the United States.A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House Arthur Schlesinger Jr 1965 p 669-673 In 1961, Venezuela and Colombia broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba and a new meeting was called between the OAS nations. By a vote of 14 to 2, with five nations abstaining, the OAS timetabled a council meeting for January 1962. In the buildup to that meeting Argentinian President Arturo Frondizi outlined his reservations to Washington's plans, stating that the U.S. was \\"obsessed with Cuba at the expense of the needs of the hemisphere\\" and that retaliation against the island would only strengthen Fidel Castro. States were also concerned about how any anti-Cuban measure would be perceived by the largely pro-Castro populations of Latin America. Pressure from the United States continued via U.S. ambassador to the OAS DeLesseps Morrison. Punta del Este gathering On 21 January 1962, the OAS held the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Punta del Este, Uruguay. The United States had encouraged Central American representatives to advocate a hard line against Cuba, and to walk out if sanctions were not tabled. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador were opposed to sanctions, Uruguay and Haiti were uncertain. United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk was hopeful that 14 votes, two thirds of the council would suffice to ensure U.S. policy in the region. After initial talks, the foreign minister of Haiti had a series of private discussions with the U.S. party. As a result, the U.S. agreed to resume aid to the nation in return for their support of sanctions against Cuba. Aid to Haiti had been suspended following the rise of the authoritarian autocrat Fran√ßois Duvalier. Argentina proposed a compromise that would see Cuba expelled from the organization. The proposal would also be supplemented by partial economic sanctions and the establishment of a special security committee. This was accepted by the U.S. who agreed to defend the new scheme. In his key speech to the organization, Dean Rusk stated that Cuba's alignment with the Sino-Soviet block was incompatible with the inter-American system, and such measures were imperative. Though only 14 nations voted explicitly to exclude Cuba from the organization, all twenty republics supported the declaration forwarded by the U.S. Seventeen states voted to suspend arms sales to Cuba, 16 voted to follow this with a trade embargo, and 19 voted to create a Committee of Experts to combat \\"Cuba's subversive activities\\". Conclusions of the decision The vote was passed by 14 in favor, with one against (Cuba) and six abstentions (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico). The operative part of the resolution read as follows: # That adherence by any member of the Organization of American States to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism is incompatible with the inter-American system and the alignment of such a government with the communist bloc breaks the unity and solidarity of the hemisphere. # That the present Government of Cuba, which has officially identified itself as a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist government, is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the inter-American system. # That this incompatibility excludes the present Government of Cuba from participation in the inter-American system. This means that the Cuban nation was still technically a member state, but that the current government was denied the right of representation and attendance at meetings and of participation in activities. The OAS's position was that although Cuba's participation is suspended, its obligations under the Charter, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, etc. still hold: for instance, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights continued to publish reports on Cuba's human rights situation and to hear individual cases involving Cuban nationals. However, this stance was occasionally questioned by other individual member states. Cuba's position was stated in an official note sent to the Organization \\"merely as a courtesy\\" by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Ra√∫l Roa on 4 November 1964: \\"Cuba was arbitrarily excluded... The Organization of American States has no juridical, factual, or moral jurisdiction, nor competence, over a state which it has illegally deprived of its rights.\\" Rapprochement attempts The reincorporation of Cuba as an active member regularly arose as a topic within the inter-American system (e.g., it was intimated by the outgoing ambassador of Mexico in 1998) but most observers did not see it as a serious possibility while the present government remained in power. Since 1960, the Cuban administration had repeatedly characterized the OAS as the \\"Ministry of Colonies\\" of the United States of America. On 6 May 2005, President Fidel Castro reiterated that the island nation would not \\"be part of a disgraceful institution that has only humiliated the honor of Latin American nations\\". On 3 June 2009, foreign ministers assembled in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, for the OAS's 39th General Assembly, passed a vote to lift Cuba's suspension from the OAS. In its resolution (AG/RES 2438), the General Assembly decided that: #Resolution VI, [...] which excluded the Government of Cuba from its participation in the Inter-American system, hereby ceases to have effect #The participation of the Republic of Cuba in the OAS will be the result of a process of dialogue initiated at the request of the Government of Cuba, and in accordance with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS. The United States had been urging for weeks that the OAS base Cuba's readmission to the hemispheric group on prerequisites of democratic principles and a commitment to human rights; after the vote was announced, it was pleased with the results. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Fander Falcon√≠ said, \\"This is a new proposal, it has no conditions ‚Äì of any kind,\\" Falcon√≠ said. \\"That suspension was made in the Cold War, in the language of the Cold War. What we have done here is to fix a historic error.\\" In an editorial published by Granma, Fidel Castro applauded the Assembly's \\"rebellious\\" move and said that the date would \\"be recalled by future generations.\\" However, a Declaration of the Revolutionary Government dated 8 June 2009 stated that while Cuba welcomed the Assembly's gesture, in light of the Organization's historical record \\"Cuba will not return to the OAS\\". As recently as January 2014 Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez has said that \\"Cuba‚Äôs position in relation to the OAS remains unchanged, we will not return to it\\".

Originally a scholar of humble background, he became a subordinate of the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty and gradually rose through the ranks. Between 210 and 220, he served as the governor of the remote and restive Jiao Province in southern China. During the Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling of 221‚Äì222, he quelled local uprisings in Sun Quan's territories in southern Jing Province and maintained peace in the area. After Sun Quan became emperor in 229, Bu Zhi oversaw the Wu armed forces guarding the Wu‚ÄìShu border at Xiling (present-day Yichang, Hubei) for about 20 years. During this time, he also gave advice to Sun Quan's first heir apparent, Sun Deng, and spoke up for officials affected by L√º Yi's abuses of power. In 246, he became the fourth Imperial Chancellor of Wu, but died in office in the following year. Bu Zhi was known for being magnanimous, generous and capable of putting up with indignities ‚Äì these traits earned him much respect from many people, including his enemies. He was able to hide his emotions well and project a calm and serious demeanour. However, the historian Pei Songzhi criticised Bu Zhi for supporting Sun Quan's fourth son Sun Ba in the succession struggle against Sun Quan's second heir apparent Sun He, and added that this incident left a huge stain on Bu Zhi's good reputation. Family background Bu Zhi was from Huaiyin County (), Linhuai Commandery (), which is around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu.(Ê≠•Èö≤Â≠óÂ≠êÂ±±ÔºåËá®Ê∑ÆÊ∑ÆÈô∞‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. He traced his ancestry to Yangshi (), an aristocrat of the Jin state in the Spring and Autumn period. As Yangshi's estate was located in an area called \\"Bu\\" (Ê≠•; around present-day Linfen County, Shanxi), his descendants adopted \\"Bu\\" as their family name. One of Yangshi's descendants was Bu Shusheng (Ê≠•Âèî‰πò; or Bu Shucheng), a disciple of Confucius. Sometime in the early Western Han dynasty, a certain General Bu received the peerage \\"Marquis of Huaiyin\\" () from the emperor as a reward for his contributions in battle. Bu Zhi descended from this General Bu, whose marquisate was in Huaiyin County.(Âê≥Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÊôâÊúâÂ§ßÂ§´ÊèöÈ£üÈááÊñºÊ≠•ÔºåÂæåÊúâÊ≠•ÂèîÔºåËàá‰∏ÉÂçÅÂ≠êÂ∏´‰∫ã‰ª≤Â∞º„ÄÇÁß¶Êº¢‰πãÈöõÊúâÁÇ∫Â∞áËªçËÄÖÔºå‰ª•ÂäüÂ∞ÅÊ∑ÆÈô∞‰æØÔºåÈö≤ÂÖ∂Âæå‰πü„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 52. Early life When chaos broke out in central China towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Bu Zhi fled south to the Jiangdong region to avoid trouble. Alone and penniless, he befriended one Wei Jing () from Guangling Commandery () who was around the same age as him. They farmed crops to feed themselves. Bu Zhi tirelessly toiled in the fields in the day and diligently read books at night.(‰∏ñ‰∫ÇÔºåÈÅøÈõ£Ê±üÊù±ÔºåÂñÆË∫´Á™ÆÂõ∞ÔºåËàáÂª£ÈôµË°ûÊóåÂêåÂπ¥Áõ∏ÂñÑÔºå‰ø±‰ª•Á®ÆÁìúËá™Áµ¶ÔºåÊôùÂã§ÂõõÈ´îÔºåÂ§úË™¶Á∂ìÂÇ≥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52.

Bu Zhi and Wei Jing settled in Kuaiji Commandery (), where they encountered an influential landlord, Jiao Zhengqiang (), who allowed his retainers to behave lawlessly. As Bu Zhi and Wei Jing feared that Jiao Zhengqiang would seize the plot of land on which they farmed, they decided to offer him some of their produce as tribute. When they arrived at his residence, he was asleep so they had to wait outside. After some time, Wei Jing became impatient and wanted to leave, but Bu Zhi stopped him and said, \\"We came here because we feared he would seize our land. If we come here to visit him and then leave without even meeting him, he might think that we're insulting him and we'll only end up antagonising him.\\"(ÊúÉÁ®ΩÁÑ¶ÂæÅÁæåÔºåÈÉ°‰πãË±™ÊóèÔºå‰∫∫ÂÆ¢ÊîæÁ∏±„ÄÇÈö≤ËàáÊóåÊ±ÇÈ£üÂÖ∂Âú∞ÔºåÊáºÁÇ∫ÊâÄ‰æµÔºå‰πÉÂÖ±ËÑ©Âà∫Â•âÁìúÔºå‰ª•ÁçªÂæÅÁæå„ÄÇÂæÅÁæåÊñπÂú®ÂÖßÂçßÔºåÈßê‰πãÁßªÊôÇÔºåÊóåÊ¨≤ÂßîÂéªÔºåÈö≤Ê≠¢‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊú¨ÊâÄ‰ª•‰æÜÔºåÁïèÂÖ∂ÂΩä‰πüÔºõËÄå‰ªäËàçÂéªÔºåÊ¨≤‰ª•ÁÇ∫È´òÔºåÁ•óÁµêÊÄ®ËÄ≥„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 52. After a while, Jiao Zhengqiang woke up, saw them through the window, and instructed his servants to lay mats on the ground for them to sit outside while he remained indoors. Wei Jing was enraged but Bu Zhi remained calm and composed. When it was time for lunch, Jiao Zhengqiang feasted on tasty dishes and did not invite them to join him. Instead, he had scraps of food served to them in small bowls. Wei Jing, who received only vegetables and mushrooms, was so unhappy that he did not eat at all. In contrast, Bu Zhi finished all the food he got. They then bid farewell to Jiao Zhengqiang and left. Wei Jing later scolded Bu Zhi, \\"How can you put up with this?\\" Bu Zhi replied, \\"We're of lowly status. He treated us in a manner befitting our status.

L√º Yi abused his powers by picking on trivialities and framing numerous officials under his watch for committing serious offences. He also freely abused his powers to investigate and prosecute officials, some of whom were arrested, imprisoned and tortured. Even officials like Zhu Ju, a high- ranking general, and Gu Yong, the Imperial Chancellor, fell victim to L√º Yi's malice. Bu Zhi wrote to Sun Quan at least four times to speak up against L√º Yi's abuses of power. He also advised Sun Quan to rely on capable officials such as Gu Yong, Lu Xun and Pan Jun.

The conflict had a polarising effect on Sun Quan's subjects and led to the emergence of two opposing factions: On one side, Lu Xun, Zhuge Ke, Gu Tan, Zhu Ju, Teng Yin, Shi Ji, Ding Mi () and Wu Can believed that Sun He was the rightful heir apparent so they supported him.

It is a grade II* listed building. The museum is located in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. It is also included in one of the regional routes of the European Route of Industrial Heritage. Despite the name of the museum, it is a complex of buildings from two works, the Gladstone and the Roslyn. The protected features include the kilns. As there are less than 50 surviving bottle ovens in Stoke-on-Trent (and only a scattering elsewhere in the UK), the museum's kilns along with others in the Longton conservation area represent a significant proportion of the national stock of the structures. History A pottery factory first opened on the site in 1787. It was run by the Shelley family who produced earthenware and decorated plates and dishes produced by Josiah Wedgwood in Etruria. The site was purchased in 1789 by William Ward who split it into two pot banks: the Park Place Works subsequently named the Roslyn works, and the Wards Pot Bank which was sold to John Hendley Sheridan in 1818. In the 1850s Sheridan had rented out the site to Thomas Cooper who employed 41 adults and 26 children to produce china and parian figures. By 1876 the Wards site had passed into the hands of R. Hobson and Co. and had been renamed Gladstone, after the politician William Ewart Gladstone.http://www.stokemuseums.org.uk/visit/gpm/history/ History of Gladstone Pottery The factory opened as a museum in 1974, the buildings having been saved from demolition in 1970 when the pottery closed (some ten years after its bottle ovens were last fired). In the 1990s ownership passed to Stoke-on-Trent City Council. The museum has shown its commitment to industrial heritage by functioning as a working pottery. However, production has had to be curtailed for financial reasons and the museum is therefore less of a \\"living\\" museum than it was. As at 2014 the Middleport Pottery in Burslem, which is used for commercial production, is arguably the only working Victorian pottery in the city of Stoke-on-Trent. Process of making table- ware The clay and ground bone were mixed in the sliphouse. Bowls, plates and saucers were pressed, jiggered and jolleyed or moulded from the slip. The green (un-fired) china was left to dry in the greenhouse. At the same time the saggars that would hold them in the kiln were made. The bottle oven kiln is protected by an outer hovel, which helps to create an updraught. The biscuit kiln was filled with clay sealed saggars of green (un-fired) flatwares (bedded in flint) by placers. The doors (clammins) were bricked up and the firing began. Each firing took 14 tons of coal. Fires were lit in the firemouths and baited every four hours, flames rose up inside the kilns, heat passed between the bungs of saggars. They controlled the temperature of the firing using dampers in the crown. The temperature was gauged by watching the contraction of bullers rings (a pyrometric device placed in the kiln). A kiln would be fired to 1250C. The biscuitwares are glazed. They fired again in the bigger glost kilns- again they are placed in sealed saggars, items separated by kiln furniture such as stints, saddles and thimbles. The table-ware would then be decorated by transfers or by painting and placed in the muffle kiln.Interpretation board at Gladstone Pottery Museum. The enamel kiln (or muffle kiln) is of different construction- it fired at 700C. The pots were stacked on 7 or 8 levels of clay bats (shelves). The door was iron lined with brick. When the kiln cooled the product was transported in basket and exported to different parts of the country and empire using the canal network and the ports on the River Mersey. Buildings The museum is centred on the Roslyn pottery. It contains two biscuit ovens and two larger glost ovens. In addition are two enamel kilns. A tandem compound steam engine by Marshall & Sons, of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire is in place but it is turned by an electric motor. The two muffle kilns came from elsewhere. Displays The museum allows the visitor to explore the bottle kilns and exhibits the principal ancillary rooms: the engine house, the slip room, saggar making workshop. It shows aspects of working with clay- including hands on displays of throwing, moulding and decorating. Colour and gilding is presented as interpretive panels. There is a gallery explaining the history of the tile: how it was pressed glazed and decorated. In one tableau the \\"Gladstone Vase\\" by Frederick Alfred Rhead is displayed. There is also a gallery charting the history of sanitary ware, privies, earth closets and water closets. Accessed via Questia Online Library (subscription required) Media interest Gladstone has seen its share of celebrity interest, from Tony Robinson filming for a BBC documentary 'The Worst Jobs in Britain' and from Alan Titchmarsh. It also has regular visits from the Blue Peter crew, and numerous children's TV programmes. In 1986, parts 13 and 14 of the Doctor Who serial The Trial of a Time Lord were shot at the museum. In the early 1990s it was featured on Noel's House Party with a live 'gunging' outside of the bottle kilns. Gladstone pottery museum was featured on Living TV's popular series, \\"Most Haunted\\". The museum featured in the third episode of the BBC One programme 24 Hours in the Past featuring six celebrities working in the Victorian era. The episode aired on 12 May 2015. Celebrations and events The museum holds annual events from Halloween ghosts walks and tours, to Christmas Carol Concerts and seasonal festivals. It also caters for children with Egg Easter Hunts and Summer Pottery workshops.

Encyc. v. 468, s.v. France The name was chosen to imply that the Grand Sanhedrin had the authority of the original Sanhedrin that had been the main legislative and judicial body of the Jewish people in classical and late antiquity. Assembly of Notables An Assembly of Jewish notables was summoned in April 1806 by the Emperor to consider a set of 12 questions. Those who attended were largely from the Bordeaux or Rhine regions (Alsace and Lorraine). They were led by Rabbi David Sinzheim of Strasbourg, who later became the chairman (\\"nasi\\") of the Grand Sanhedrin. The questions presented were: Cover page to siddur used at the Grand Sanhedrin of Napoleon, 1807. # Is it lawful for Jews to have more than one wife? # Is divorce allowed by the Jewish religion? Is divorce valid, although pronounced not by courts of justice but by virtue of laws in contradiction to the French code? # May a Jewess marry a Christian, or [May] a Jew [marry] a Christian woman? or does Jewish law order that the Jews should only intermarry among themselves? # In the eyes of Jews are Frenchmen not of the Jewish religion considered as brethren or as strangers? # What conduct does Jewish law prescribe toward Frenchmen not of the Jewish religion? # Do the Jews born in France, and treated by the law as French citizens, acknowledge France as their country? Are they bound to defend it? Are they bound to obey the laws and follow the directions of the civil code? # Who elects the rabbis? # What kind of police jurisdiction do the rabbis exercise over the Jews? What judicial power do they exercise over them? # Are the police jurisdiction of the rabbis and the forms of the election regulated by Jewish law, or are they only sanctioned by custom? # Are there professions from which the Jews are excluded by their law? # Does Jewish law forbid the Jews to take usury from their brethren? # Does it forbid, or does it allow, usury in dealings with strangers? Creation of the Grand Sanhedrin At one of the meetings of the Notables, Commissioner Count Louis-Mathieu Mol√© expressed the satisfaction of the emperor with their answers, and announced that the emperor, requiring a pledge of strict adherence to these principles, had resolved to call together a 'great sanhedrin' which should convert the answers into decisions and make them the basis of the future status of the Jews, create a new organization, and condemn all false interpretations of their religious laws. In order that this sanhedrin, reviving the old Sanhedrin of Jerusalem, might be vested with the same sacred character as that time-honored institution, it was to be constituted on a similar pattern: it was to be composed of seventy-one members‚Äîtwo-thirds of them rabbis and one-third laymen. The Assembly of Notables, which was to continue its sessions, was to elect the members of the sanhedrin, and notify the several communities of Europe of its meeting, \\"that they may send deputies worthy of communicating with you and able to give to the government additional information.\\" The Assembly of Notables was to appoint also a committee of nine, whose duty it would be to prepare the work of the sanhedrin and devise a plan for the future organization of the Jews in France and Italy (see Consistoire). On October 6, 1806, the Assembly of Notables issued a proclamation to all the Jewish communities of Europe, inviting them to send delegates to the sanhedrin, to convene on October 20. This proclamation, written in Hebrew, French, German, and Italian, speaks in extravagant terms of the importance of this revived institution and of the greatness of its imperial protector. While the action of Napoleon aroused in many Jews of Germany the hope that, influenced by it, their governments also would grant them the rights of citizenship, others looked upon it as a political contrivance. When in the war against Prussia (1806-7) the emperor invaded Poland and the Jews rendered great services to his army, he remarked, laughing, \\"The sanhedrin is at least useful to me.\\" David Friedl√§nder and his friends in Berlin described it as a spectacle that Napoleon offered to the Parisians.\\" Medallion struck by the Paris mint in commemoration of the Grand Sanhedrin. The opening of the sanhedrin was delayed until Feb. 9, 1807, four days after the adjournment of the Assembly of Notables. Its seventy-one members included the rabbis sitting in the Assembly, to whom were added twenty-nine other rabbis and twenty-five laymen. Its presiding officers, appointed by the minister of the interior, were: Joseph David Sinzheim, rabbi of Strasbourg (president); Joshua Benzion Segre, rabbi, and member of the municipal council of Vercelli (first vice-president); Abraham de Cologna, rabbi of Mantua (second vice-president). After a solemn religious service in the synagogue, the members assembled in the H√¥tel de Ville, in a hall specially prepared for them. Following the ancient custom, they took their seats in a semicircle, according to age, on both sides of the presiding officers, the laymen behind the rabbis. They were attired in black garments, with silk capes and three-cornered hats. The sittings were public, and many visitors were present. The first meeting was opened with a Hebrew prayer written by David Sinzheim; after the address of the president and of Abraham Furtado, chairman of the Assembly of Notables, it was adjourned. At the second sitting, Feb. 12, 1807, deputies Asser, Lemon, and Litwack, of the newly constituted Amsterdam Reform congregation Adat Jeshurun, addressed the sanhedrin, Litwack in Hebrew, the others in French, expressing their entire approval of the Assembly and promising their hearty support. But the deputies were greatly disappointed when the president, after having answered them in Hebrew, invited them to be silent listeners instead of taking part in the debates as the proclamation of the Notables had caused them to expect. Addresses from congregations in France, Italy, and the Rhenish Confederation, especially from Neuwied and Dresden, were also presented. Sessions of the Grand Sanhedrin In the sittings of Feb. 16, 19, 23, 26, and March 2, the sanhedrin voted without discussion on the replies of the Assembly of Notables, and passed them as laws. At the eighth meeting, on March 9, Hildesheimer, deputy from Frankfurt-am-Main, and Asser of Amsterdam delivered addresses, to which the president responded in Hebrew expressing great hopes for the future. After having received the thanks of the members, he closed the sanhedrin. The Notables convened again on March 25, prepared an official report, and presented it on April 6, 1807; then the imperial commissioners declared the dissolution of the Assembly of Notables. The decisions of the sanhedrin, formulated in nine articles and drawn up in French and Hebrew, were as follows: # That, in conformity with the decree of R. Gershom ben Judah, polygamy is forbidden to the Israelites; # That divorce by the Jewish law is valid only after previous decision of the civil authorities; # That the religious act of marriage must be preceded by a civil contract; # That marriages contracted between Israelites and Christians are binding, although they cannot be celebrated with religious forms; # That every Israelite is religiously bound to consider his non-Jewish fellow citizens as brothers, and to aid, protect, and love them as though they were coreligionists; # That the Israelite is required to consider the land of his birth or adoption as his fatherland, and shall love and defend it when called upon; # That Judaism does not forbid any kind of handicraft or occupation; # That it is commendable for Israelites to engage in agriculture, manual labor, and the arts, as their ancestors in Israel were wont to do; # That, finally, Israelites are forbidden to exact usury from Jew or Christian. In the introduction to these resolutions, the Grand Sanhedrin declared that, by virtue of the right conferred upon it by ancient custom and law, it constituted, like the ancient Sanhedrin, a legal assembly vested with the power of passing ordinances in order to promote the welfare of Israel and inculcate obedience to the laws of the state. These resolutions formed the basis of all subsequent laws and regulations of the French government in regard to the religious affairs of the Jews, although Napoleon, in spite of the declarations, issued a decree on March 17, 1808, restricting the Jews' legal rights. The plan of organization prepared by the committee of nine, having for its object the creation of consistories, was not submitted to the Sanhedrin, but was promulgated by Napoleon's decree of March 17, 1808.

He was a descendant of Liu Fei, the eldest son of the Han dynasty's founding emperor, Liu Bang (Emperor Gao). When he was 18, he became famous after rescuing a relative who was being held hostage by bandits. He started his career in the Han civil service after being nominated as a xiaolian, and was known for his incorruptibility. In 194, although he was appointed by the Han imperial court as the governor of Yang Province, he barely managed to gain a foothold over his jurisdiction because the warlord Yuan Shu controlled a large part of the territories around the Huai River region in Yang Province. In 195, conflict broke out between Liu Yao and Yuan Shu, who sent his ally Sun Ce to attack Liu Yao. Sun Ce defeated Liu Yao and forced him to retreat south into present-day Jiangxi, where Liu Yao defeated a minor warlord Ze Rong and died of illness shortly later. His elder brother was Liu Dai, another prominent warlord. Family background Liu Yao was from Muping County (), Donglai Commandery (), which is in present-day Muping District, Yantai, Shandong.

It is notable for being one of the first films to touch on post traumatic stress disorder. Holden invested $20,000 of his own money into the film. The film was panned by critics for its brooding melodrama.Submarine Command (1951) Plot Lieutenant Commander Ken White orders the submarine USS Tiger Shark to dive to evade an aerial and surface attack. Crewman Boyer begs him to wait for the captain, Commander Josh Rice, still topside, but White refuses, and Rice (his good friend) and the quartermaster are lost. When they resurface shortly afterward, they discover that the war is over. No one other than Boyer, not even the captain's widow and father, blames him. White marries Carol and remains in the Navy after the war. Everything is fine, until one day he is assigned to show a reporter around who is doing a story about the mothballed Navy. By chance, the submarine that catches the journalist's attention is the Tiger Shark. The newsman remembers the tragic story of the last day of the war and mentions that the officer who ordered the dive \\"must feel like a heel\\", and White's feelings of guilt resurface, straining his marriage. Then Boyer is assigned to his unit. When Boyer sees White, he immediately requests a transfer. As it happens, the Tiger Shark is being recommissioned, so White sends him there. A fire breaks out on the submarine, trapping a man in a compartment. Boyer wants to charge in to his rescue, but White makes him go \\"by the book\\" and put on a protective suit first, fueling Boyer's hatred. White is about to resign from the Navy to escape the ghosts of his past, but changes his mind at the last moment. As a result, Carol decides to leave him. North Korea invades South Korea the same day, starting the Korean War. White is given command of the Tiger Shark. He sets sail from the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for the war as soon as the submarine is ready. Boyer is a disgruntled member of the crew. When they rendezvous with an aircraft carrier, White is given a special mission. A colonel and his special intelligence unit are in possession of vital information, but are prisoners of war. A rescue mission is being mounted; White's job is to land men at two points to knock out enemy coastal installations in advance of a paratrooper airborne assault on the prison camp. White's part of the raid is led by Commander Peter Morris, a family friend. However, after dropping off Morris's unit first, one of the Tiger Shark engines begins overheating, endangering the timing of the second landing. To make up lost time, White makes the risky decision to enter the mined harbor. Once he sees the signal that the mission has been successful, he surfaces in order to notify his admiral, even though that exposes the submarine to fire from shore batteries. When the Tiger Shark is hit and starts sinking, White orders the crew to abandon ship. He and his men are picked up along with the freed prisoners. His demons finally exorcised, he later attends the launching of another Tiger Shark with his wife, their baby and Boyer. Cast * William Holden as Cmdr.

The bridge consists of eight triangular sections hinged at the walkway level and connected above by two-part links that can be collapsed towards the deck by hydraulic cylinders mounted vertically between the sections. When extended, it resembles a conventional steel and timber footbridge, and is 12 metres long. To allow the passage of boats, the hydraulic pistons are activated and the bridge curls up until its two ends join, to form an octagonal shape measuring one half of the waterway's width at that point.

It is long. The basin of the Canche extends to and lies in the south of the d√©partement of Pas-de-Calais. Forming an alluvial valley from wide, the Canche valley also contains marshes, meadows and small woods. The gentle gradient, averaging 1.5 percent, gives the river a meandering course. The river rises at Gouy-en-Ternois and passes Fr√©vent, Hesdin, and Montreuil-sur-Mer before leaving the chalk to flow to the coast between √âtaples and Le Touquet-Paris-Plage. Its principal tributaries are the Ternoise, the Planquette, the Cr√©quoise, the Bras de Bronne, the Course, the Dordogne (not to be confused with the Dordogne) and the Huitrepin which all join on its right bank, i.e. to the north of the Canche. The lie of the land means there is no notable tributary from the south until the Grande Tringue, which flows from marshland into the small, dredged estuary. History The valley of the Canche has been occupied by man since ancient times because of the productive nature of the land. The unhealthy aspect of marshland means much has been done over the centuries to drain the land efficiently, which has brought about the partial destruction of its original character. The principal activities of the village communities occupying the valley and its surrounds have been (and still are) farming, fishing and reed harvesting. Helga Scarwell et Magalie Franchomme, Autour des zones humides : espaces productifs d'hier et conflits d'aujourd'hui, La revue en sciences de l'environnement: Vertigo, 1 mai 2005. Read online The extraction of peat from the marshes of the lower river was known in the 16th century; peat being the principal means of heating and also a multi-purpose fertilizer. The alder tree, which grew well in the local marshy soils, contributed to bind the ground, and produced timber. It was realized that forestry also helped in drainage. Further developments in the 18th century saw permanent enclosures with animals being fenced-in, keeping them off the crops, and property boundaries being created by the planting of hedges and the digging of ditches, contributing to organized and cooperative farming methods. The 18th century also saw the emergence of new perceptions of marshland, long considered as unhealthy places in which to live. Administrative authorities encouraged action to recover the peat marshes by drainage work and the planting of more trees. The reduction of marshland again allowed for even more areas of cultivation to feed the increasing population. During the 19th century, technical progress (for example, the replacement of windmills by steam engines) led to further improvements in drainage, contributing to the drying-up of the valley downstream as far as Hesdin). In the last quarter of the 20th century the authorities became aware of the importance of the marshes and started trying to preserve them, having earlier contributed to their disappearance. The Canche and its valley have been incorporated into a national natural reserve since 1987. The estuary of the Canche on the website of the conservation of the coast). Environmental issues The Canche estuary was the first site in northern France where a conservation victory, in respect of the coast, was first achieved, in 1976. Plans had been made to put in place an earlier project, dating from the 1960s, to create an artificial environment on the estuary. The work included creating a harbour and a marina. This was supposed to be ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù for extracting the waters of the Canche at Hesdin in order to supply the city of Lille. Of course, this threatened to destroy the rich wildlife and flora of the estuary. The mobilisation of the local inhabitants, various associations and many scientists, after many public enquiries and heated arguments, stopped the plans and left the estuary to nature.The barrage project on the F√©d√©ration Nord-Nature website. Flora and fauna The estuary of the Canche With sandbars and spits, the estuary of the Canche is typical of the estuaries of this region of France. The coastal dunes, marshes and valley are home to 485 different plants and a diverse range of wildlife. Seventy-five varieties of resident and migratory birds nest in and around the estuary and valley, such as the nightjar, woodlark, several types of warblers, snipe, oyster catchers (using rabbit-holes as homes) and the predatory merlin and buzzard. This area shelters mammals such as deer, wild boar, foxes, badgers, stoats, squirrels, rabbits and the occasional seal, but, in contrast to the bay of the Somme, the estuary of the Canche does not seem to possess a seal colony. Numerous amphibians (Common toads, newts and frogs) are found in and along the river.

He formed the most successful farmers' union in Fiji and forced the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to make concessions to farmers after 60 years of total control over Fiji's economy. However, other Indo-Fijian leaders formed rival unions and his initial success was not repeated. He also served as a member of the Legislative Council between 1953 and 1959.  First trip to Fiji  Ayodhya Prasad was born in Butana village in the district of Rohtak in the state of Punjab in India on 30 April 1909. While studying in India, he learned about the freedom enjoyed by people in foreign countries and decided to go to one of these countries. He persuaded his father to let him travel overseas for three years and arrived in Fiji in January 1929. Since there was a shortage of teachers in Fiji he obtained a third grade teacher's certificate and started teaching in Gurkul Primary School in Saweni, Lautoka. Due to public demand he soon left for Tunaliya, Nadi where he helped to build a school. There was no syllabus for teaching Hindi and when the school inspector found him teaching Hindi using a book which aroused nationalistic spirit amongst the Fiji Indians, Ayodhya Prasad was asked to stop using the book. He refused and his registration as a teacher was cancelled. In 1931 he returned to India. On his way to India, Ayodhya Prasad met an American, with whom he had a discussion about the political situation in India. At the end of the discussion he realised that Indians were under the control of foreigners, not because the English were bad but because the Indians were not united.  Return to Fiji  Ayodhya Prasad returned to Fiji in April 1932 to prepare to go to America to study. To earn money for his trip, he acquired some land in Yalalevu, Ba and started cane farming. He worked very hard on this farm but was told by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) that most of his cane had turned into molasses and his cane had very low sugar content. The money he received for the cane was not even sufficient to cover his costs. He did not receive any statement from the company detailing the amount received for the cane and the amount deducted for costs like fertiliser. His dream of going to America was in tatters. In the 1937 Legislative Council elections he supported Chattur Singh, who defeated his more educated opponent, A. D. Patel by a narrow margin but this result was to have profound implications for the relationship between A.D. Patel and Ayodhya Prasad in later years. After the election, people who had seen the determination with which he had campaigned in the election, persuaded him to give up his dream of going to America and to organise the farmers of Fiji.  Formation of Kisan Sangh  Well aware that there was great fear amongst the Fiji Indian cane farmers of the Company, he started organising the farmers union in secret concentrating among the young members of the community because they were more passionate and were unlikely to be owners or lessees of property. In September 1937, he held the first secret meeting in Drasa, Lautoka following the celebrations marking the birth of Lord Krishna. On 27 November 1937, at a meeting in Wailailai, Ba, the Kisan Sangh (Farmers' Union) was formed. The first task for the new Union was to find someone to take up leadership of the new union. A number of people which included A.D. Patel, S. B. Patel and Swami Rudhrananda, Chattur Singh and Vishnu Deo were approached, but all declined the invitation. Undeterred, Ayodhya Prasad decided that the best solution was to learn from Mahatma Gandhi and live amongst the farmers while he preached the virtues of the Union to them. He decided to set up tents on Company land in different settlements so that he and his helpers could preach from it. On 18 May 1938, with the help of his young volunteers, he set up tent on Company land starting in Nadroga which is at the Southern end of the North Western cane growing area of Viti Levu and moved along the coast to the Northern end of Viti Levu. Initially none of the local farmers approached the tent but as the farmers saw the sacrifice being made by Ayodhya Prasad and his young volunteers and the inability of the Company overseers to stop him, they gradually started to join up. Following the success of this grass-roots campaign, Ayodhya Prasad spent the next four months organising the Kisan Sangh. First village committees were formed. These committees then met and formed district committees which selected members for the Central Committee based on the membership of the district committee.  Campaign for Cane Contract  On 9 February a letter was sent to the Company seeking negotiations for a cane contract but the Company ignored the Kisan Sangh. The CSR controlled the farmers through the sardars, and so Ayodhya Prasad put up candidates in the election for sardars and won most of these positions. Most sardars then took advice from the Kisan Sangh on receiving any Company directive. On seeing the strength of the Kisan Sangh, the Company started issuing statements with cane payments and circulated a contract for the next season's crop, both of which were original Kisan Sangh demands. Ayodhya Prasad and the Kisan Sangh advised the farmers not to plant crops for the following year until a suitable contract was agreed to. Under pressure from the Government, agreement was reached for a 10-year contract which included several concessions by the Company and an increase in the price of cane.  Involvement in politics  By 1940 the Kisan Sangh had become the most powerful organisation in Fiji and in July 1940 had a membership of 4245 from a total of 5918 cane-farmers in the North Western districts of Viti Levu. In the Legislative Council election in 1940, B.D. Lakshman stood for the North Western Constituency with Kisan Sangh and Ayodhya Prasad's support and won easily. On 15 June 1941, A.D. Patel formed the Maha Sangh, in opposition to Ayodhya Prasad's Kisan Sangh. Ayodhya Prasad and his supporters tried to stop the formation of the new union but were not successful. In 1943, Ayodhya Prasad was devastated when some executive members of the Kisan Sangh supported the Maha Sangh in a strike for a new contract, despite the fact that the contract signed by farmers in 1940 was for a period of ten years. Ignoring pleas from Ayodhya Prasad, farmers did not start harvesting on time and lost thousands of dollars. In the meantime, efforts by the Government to restrict the movement of A.D. Patel only increased his support. By 1944, the Kisan Sangh was badly split and A.D. Patel, easily won the election for the North Western Constituency seat in the Legislative Council.  Rebuilding the Kisan Sangh  It took Ayodhya Prasad until 1950 to rebuild the Kisan Sangh so that it was again the largest farmers' organisation in Fiji with support extending to the northern cane farming areas in Vanua Levu and a new farmers' union allied to the Kisan Sangh active in the Rewa area. He also managed to force the CSR to agree a new 10-year contract in 1950 which gave further increases to the price of sugar cane. In the 1950 election, a candidate supported by Ayodhya Prasad easily defeated A.D. Patel in the North Western Indian Division in the Legislative Council. Despite being involved un politics since 1937, Ayodhya Prasad, himself stood for the Legislative Council election for the first time in 1953 when he defeated his old foe, A.D. Patel by 2718 votes to 1919 votes for North Western Constituency. In the 1956 Legislative Council elections, he faced opposition from three high profile ex-Legislative Council members: K.S. Reddy, B.D. Lakshman and Chattur Singh, but won easily. In 1959, he lost his seat to his one-time ally, B.D. Lakshman, who had gained prominence as leader of sugar mill workers.  The Twilight Years  In 1959, Ayodhya Prasad's Kisan Sangh joined a united cane growers' organisation, known as the Federation of Cane Growers, to negotiate the next ten-year contract. Differences again rose between Ayodhya Prasad's and A.D. Patel's supporters resulting in Ayodhya Prasad's supporters signing the new cane contract, while Patel's supporters went on strike. Ayodhya Prasad and the Kisan Sangh were blamed for the failure of the farmers to get a good deal and in the 1963 Legislative Council elections, Patel and his supporters won all the Indian Communal seats in the cane growing areas. In 1965, on the eve of the London Constitutional Conference, Ayodhya Prasad formed the National Congress of Fiji and made representation to the United Nations on behalf of Fiji Indians. In late 1965, he worked with Ratu Mara to form the Alliance Party. As Ayodhya Prasd was flexible about the system of voting, Ratu Kamisese Mara found that he could guarantee more secure land tenure to Indian farmers in return for working with the Congress to form the Alliance Party. In the 1966 Legislative Council election, he again stood against Patel, and lost by a large margin. He was disappointed with Vijay R. Singh for encouraging direct membership for Indians into the Alliance Party instead of through the National Congress of Fiji. He believed that if the Congress had remained a constituent part of the Alliance Party then Fiji Indians would have had an equal say in it. With failing health he could do little and the Fiji National Congress was wound up. Ayodhya Prasad died on 28 February 1972.  References   Bibliography  * A.P.

Jeweller Hinds was a jeweller from London who, with his brother Frank, owned and ran Hinds Jewellers. Hinds and his brother had different business priorities, and shortly after the First World War they divided the business in two. Both businesses were successful. Frank's part grew into the national jeweller F. Hinds, which has over 100 branches across England & Wales and is still owned and managed by the Hinds family. Hinds continued to expand his business until he owned 25 jeweller's shops. He diversified into other types of retail, including operating barbers above some of the jewellery shops. Theatrical career Hinds became involved in music halls and the theatre. His involvement included owning a number of seaside theatres, for example the West Cliff Theatre in Clacton, and performing onstage as a comedian, although it was said that the latter was not his greatest strength. He also ran summer concert parties in conjunction with Jack Payne, the famous bandleader, and led a troupe called Will Hammer's Players, taking his stage name of Hammer from Hammersmith, where he lived. In 1957 he set up Cascade Entertainments Ltd with theatre impresario George Baines and produced \\"Big Splash\\" Aqua Show at The Derby Baths in Blackpool. The show featured the singer Robert Earle and a troupe of divers and swimmers and was performed for the summer season. It was during the rehearsals for this show that he died following the bicycle accident. Motion picture career Success with his theatres led Hinds to diversify into the increasingly popular motion picture industry. In November 1934, Hinds registered his own film company, Hammer Productions Ltd. Work began almost immediately on the first Hammer film, The Public Life of Henry the Ninth at the MGM/ATP studios, with shooting concluding on 2 January 1935. During this period Hinds met Spanish √©migr√© Enrique Carreras, a former cinema owner, and on 10 May 1935 they formed a film distribution company Exclusive Films. A slump in the British film industry forced Hammer Productions Ltd. into bankruptcy and the company went into liquidation in 1937. Exclusive, however, survived and continued to distribute films made by other companies.Hearn and Barnes, op cit, p. 9 James Carreras (son of Enrique) resurrected the company in 1946 as Hammer Film Productions, the film production arm of Exclusive.Kinsey. op cit p. 11. Cycling interest leads to death A lifelong interest of Hinds was cycling. He owned a number of cycle shops. Hinds met his death while riding his bicycle near his Leatherhead home in 1957, a year after the centenary of the family jewellery business. Family Hinds's oldest son William \\"Bill\\" Hinds continued to run the jewellery shops for many years. These were sold in the 1960s, but Bill continued as a jeweller. His widow eventually sold his remaining shop in Worthing, Sussex to the other half of the family, reuniting the jewellery business. It is now a branch of F. Hinds. His second son, Anthony \\"Tony\\" Hinds, rejoined Hammer Film Productions in 1946. He had one more son Geoffrey Hinds and two daughters Shirley Hinds and Susan Hinds. At the time of his death he had been living with his long term partner Pat Hinds, mother of Susan, for thirteen years. References External links * * Official Hammer website * F.

The rower on the left of the photo, or the bow of the boat. is rowing \\"starboard\\" or \\"bowside\\". The rower on the right of the photo and closest to the stern of the boat is rowing \\"port\\" or \\"strokeside\\". A coxless pair is a rowing boat used in the sport of competitive rowing. It is designed for two rowers, who propel the boat with sweep oars. The crew consists of a pair of rowers, each having one oar, one on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and one on the bow side (rower's lefthand side). As the name suggests, there is no coxswain on such a boat, and the two rowers must co-ordinate steering and the proper timing of oar strokes between themselves or by means of a steering installation which is operated by foot from one of the rowers. The equivalent boat when it is steered by a cox is referred to as a \\"coxed pair\\". Racing boats (often called \\"shells\\") are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag to a minimum. Originally made from wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material (usually carbon-fibre reinforced plastic) for strength and weight advantages. Pairs have a fin towards the rear, to help prevent roll and yaw. The riggers are staggered alternately along the boat so that the forces apply asymmetrically to each side of the boat. A coxless pair is often considered the most difficult boat to row, as each rower must balance his/her side in cooperation with the other, apply equal power, place their catch and extract the blade simultaneously in order to move the boat efficiently. It requires excellent technique, communication and experience. \\"Coxless pair\\" is one of the classes recognized by the International Rowing Federation and is competed in the Olympic Games.FISA World Rowing ‚Äì Olympic Games See also *Rowing at the Summer Olympics *World Rowing Championships *Silver Goblets & Nickalls' Challenge Cup References Category:Rowing racing boats ","title":"Coxless pair"},{"id":"6632331","title":"Mojo Webb"},{"id":"6632342","title":"List of Super Rugby stadiums"},{"id":"6632347","text":"Jon Lee Anderson (born January 15, 1957) is an American biographer, author, investigative reporter, war correspondent and staff writer for The New Yorker, reporting from war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Uganda, Palestine, El Salvador, Ireland, Lebanon, Iran, and throughout the Middle East as well as during Hurricane Katrina rescue efforts with K38 Water Safety as documented in the New Yorker article Leaving Desire. Anderson has also written for The New York Times, Harper's, Life, and The Nation. Anderson has profiled political leaders such as Hugo Ch√°vez, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and Augusto Pinochet. Career Anderson began working as a reporter in 1979 for the Lima Times in Peru. During the 1980s he covered Central America, first for the syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, and later for Time, Life, The Nation, and Harper's. Anderson is also the author of a biography of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara called Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, first published in 1997. While conducting research for the book in Bolivia, he discovered the hidden location of Guevara's burial from where his skeletal remains were exhumed in 1997 and returned to Cuba. Bibliography Literary reception Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life has received widespread acclaim as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year and many reprints. In her 1997 critique of the book, U.S. author Jane Franklin claims \\"Anderson never quite communicates an understanding of why Guevara remains such a powerful presence. Relying too much on secondary sources for his knowledge of Cuban history, he fails to grasp the nature of the revolution for which Guevara, Fidel Castro and so many others were willing to die.\\" Conversely, author Peter Canby states, \\"Anderson does a masterly job in evoking Che's complex character, in separating the man from the myth and in describing the critical role Che played in one of the darkest periods of the cold war. Ultimately, however, the strength of his book is in its wealth of detail.\\" In Washington Monthly, Matthew Harwood praised The Fall of Baghdad, writing, \\"his crisp and lush prose reads more like a work of literature than like reportage. But for all its literary beauty, the book's real power lies in its narrative strategy\\". According to left-wing NACLA magazine, Anderson's coverage of Hugo Ch√°vez and Venezuela is rife with errors and distortions.  Personal life  The son of Joy Anderson, a children's book author and University of Florida professor, and of John Anderson, a diplomat and agricultural adviser for USAID and the Peace Corps, Anderson was raised and educated in South Korea, Colombia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Liberia, England, and the United States.

The population of the civil parish was 1,219 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 1,280 at the 2011 Census. Stannington is divided into three: Stannington North-East Quarter, Stannington North-West Quarter and Stannington South Quarter. The total area of Stannington, including Stannington Vale, is . Buildings = St Mary's church = Stannington's oldest building is the church, St. Mary The Virgin. The original church on that site dates back to 1190AD. Most of the current church was constructed in 1871, to a design by R J Johnson of Newcastle, at a cost of ¬£6,000.Northumberland Communities - Stannington It incorporates the 13th century north arcade of the medieval church, and some medieval stained glass and grave covers. The old vicarage, built in 1745, stands near the church, with the current vicarage behind. = Hospitals = There were two hospitals in the village. Stannington Children's Hospital was the first children's tuberculosis hospital in the country; St. Mary's Hospital was an asylum originally known as the Gateshead Lunatic Asylum. Both are now closed. One former hospital north-east of the village near Netherton was built in the 1930s and featured the Thomas Taylor retirement homes for Wansbeck residents. Behind the main complex was the Mona Taylor Maternity Hospital which was named after the leading suffragist, Mr Taylor's wife. Many children were born here until it too became an old people's home and, together with the rest of the site, was then owned by Northumberland County Council. Today this development is known as Hepscott Park with some original hospital buildings surviving in local authority use, other buildings converted into private homes and some additional new houses. = Other buildings = Stannington First School is located near the church. The village also has a post office. Other listed buildings in the village include two bus shelters, built in 1937 to a design by Laurence Whistler and presented to the village by Lord Ridley in commemoration of the coronation of King George VI. Transport The A1 road arcs past the village and in instances of traffic accidents or otherwise- motivated road closures, traffic from the A1 has been diverted through the village. This section of the A1 was substantially rebuilt with two new roundabouts and new junctions in 2003 and 2004 following a fatal accident in 1999.A1 re-opening at Stannington next month - Morpeth Herald In 1847 a railway station was opened near the village.

Early versions had a two-piece maple-capped neck with no \\"skunk stripe\\" on the back of the neck and some also had the rare paddle-style tuners that were most commonly seen on the Jazz Bass. The pickguard on the 1960s Telecaster Bass was slightly more slender and employed more mounting screws than the originals of the 1950s. There were also three different headstock decals in the early version. The earliest had a regular silver Telecaster guitar logo with the word \\"bass\\" added underneath. Only prototypes are known to have this decal. The earliest prototypes were partially constructed from leftover 1952 Precision Bass parts. The second decal was the larger Black (gold outlined) Telecaster Bass logo (bass being in the same style of script as Fender). The third and most commonly used decal had the silver Fender script with the words Telecaster Bass written in a sans-serif type font underneath. In the early 1990s, Fender Japan reissued the '51 Precision Bass, which is in essence, a reissue of the first-version Telecaster Bass. The earliest \\"Made in Japan\\" versions vary slightly from the current \\"Crafted in Japan\\" model.

Grana cheeses are typically made in the form of large wheels. The structure is often described as crystalline, and the wheels are divided by being split with a fairly blunt almond-shaped knife designed for the purpose, rather than being sliced, cut or sawn. Within the European Union the term Grana is legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin; only Grana Padano may be sold using the term in EU countries.\\"Grana √® solo Padano\\" (Grana is only Padano.), Consorzio per la tutela del Formaggio Grana Padano The two best-known examples of grana-type cheeses are Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano. The two cheeses are broadly similar, with the latter being less sharp, crumbly and grainy. The main difference between the two is that cows producing Parmigiano-Reggiano eat only grass and cereals‚Äîno silage, no preservatives, and no antibiotics. Cows that have been treated with antibiotics are suspended from production of Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano. Silage is a fermented forage that requires the addition of a natural preservative (lysozyme) to Grana Padano. Feeding of silage and addition of lysozyme are forbidden in production of Trentingrana and Parmigiano-Reggiano.

Pleasant, South Carolina, United States just northeast of Charleston. I'On was one of the earliest full-time residential new urbanist communities developed in the US. Location and origin I'On is approximately three miles (5 km) east of the Arthur Ravenel Bridge, which connects Charleston and Mount Pleasant. Adjacent to the I'on Club is East Cooper Montessori Charter School, the first public charter Montessori school in the state. Concert at Amphitheater in I'On, June 2004 The community was founded and planned under the direction of Vince Graham, who previously established the Newpoint community in Beaufort, South Carolina. Founded on April 30, 1995, I'On was planned as an example of the new urbanism, which includes traditional neighborhood developments. I'On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl & Partners and Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company. The community was controversial when proposed and initial plans for a more urban and diverse village of over 1,200 units, including multifamily homes and rented residences were eventually compromised in the planning process to a buildout of approximately 762 single family homes, a village square and locations for civic buildings such as churches and schools. Development plans were delayed by a lengthy legal contest with the Town of Mount Pleasant which ended with the South Carolina Supreme Court ruling in the I'On Company's favor.Council Report I: Eight New Urban Towns, The Town Paper, October 2001 Description Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared public green spaces, trails and a grid of narrow, traffic calming streets. This private/public ownership of the neighborhood allows the community landscaping and amenities to be privately maintained, while the streets are maintained by the town. (resulting in a low HOA fee). Most homes have a front porch of not less than eight feet (2.46 m) in depth. Ceiling heights of 10 feet+ (3.1 m), raised foundations and smaller lot sizes give the community a dense, vertical feel. Overall density of the neighborhood is about 3.8 units per acre, with large amounts of the community's area being taken up by parks, trails, lakes, sidewalks and other common areas. A commercial center called I'On Square serves as the community gateway. The community is connected to surrounding communities by five roads and two pedestrian walkways. Natural features include a wildlife refuge, called the Rookery, 6 miles of walking trails, 2.5 miles of marsh front paths, a deep water access boat ramp, 3 crab docks, outdoor amphitheatre, boathouse, 2 lakes, and 12 pocket parks. The community is home to East Cooper Montessori Charter School, one of the first successful Charter Schools in South Carolina. The school enrolls about 250 students in grades 1-8. The school's campus is small and students make use of community playgrounds and green spaces which are within walkable distance. The I'On Club http://www.theionclub.com offers year-round extensive tennis with 7 clay courts, aquatics with 3 pools (junior olympic saline, adult lounge pool saline, shaded baby pool as well as a gym, personal trainers, group classes and The Porch at I'On restaurant. As of 2015, the community is nearly completed with 756 homes. Businesses include the I'On Inn, Square Onion gourmet deli, O'Brion's Pub, Grace Salon Spa, Sweet Olive gift shop amongst others. The maintenance and daily operations of I'On are provided by the on site full-time Community Manager and the Assistant Manager. The 7 person Assembly (HOA) Board is elected by the residents for 2 year terms. Their responsibility is to provide strategic guidance, governance and financial oversight of the Assembly (HOA). The Board works with the Town of Mt Pleasant for road maintenance and emergency services. The Board also collaborates with the I'On Design Committee, responsible for the 'lowcountry vernacular' consistency of design in I'On. Name The community takes its name from Jacob Bond I'On. I'On was the first Mayor of the Town of Sullivan's Island. A monument to I'On erected in the 19th century stands in the Northwest part of the community at the center of a historic family cemetery which is open to visitors. A historical marker with facts about Jacob Bond I'On's life can be found where the community is entered from a round-a-bout on Mathis Ferry Road. Community Communications within I'On are a priority. The community distributes an annual resident directory and emails a monthly newsletter to all residents. Both of these publications are created by the volunteer neighborhood communications committee. The neighborhood consists primarily of custom built homes, a few spec homes, and currently no attached properties (condos & townhomes). There are no plans to allow them in the future. With an average of 20 at any given moment with prices ranging in the low $500s to over $2 Million most buyers can find something they'll like. The spirit of I'On is maintained by the I'On Trust. A legally separate, non-profit established from the beginning of the development's existence, this volunteer Trust Board is elected by its neighbors/members. The Trust Board organizes community events throughout the year. Place in New Urbanism As one of the early examples of new urbanist traditional neighborhood development, I'On draws many visitors interested in town planning. Proximity to Mt. Pleasant's historic \\"Old Village\\" from which I'On drew many planning elements and world-famous downtown Charleston, South Carolina allows planners to experience and compare both the new community and its historic models. Other new urbanist communities include Seaside and Celebration in Florida and Kentlands, Maryland.

The stories were all written using the pen-name of Martin Clifford, the majority by Charles Hamilton who was more widely known as Frank Richards, the creator of Billy Bunter. Origins The first Tom Merry story appeared in Gem number 3 dated 10 March 1907 and introduced him as a new boy at a school called Clavering College. In issue number 11, Clavering was closed down and the boys and masters transferred to St Jim's, a school which has previously featured in a boy's paper called \\"Pluck\\". From this time onwards the pattern was established and St Jim's and, Tom Merry made weekly appearances. Character In his initial appearance, Merry was a likeable boy who was dominated by his overbearing nurse and guardian, Miss Priscilla Fawcett. As the years passed her influence disappeared and Merry became the acknowledged leader of the lower school of St Jim's and the focal point of most of the stories. As his name suggests, he was cheerful and good humoured. He was also good at sports and a natural leader. With his friends, Manners and Lowther, he formed a group known as the 'Terrible Three' who were looked up to by all other juniors. After the Gem After a lull, interest in Charles Hamilton's writing increased during the 1950s and further St Jim's stories were published by Spring Books from about 1949 and by Mandeville from the 1950s. There were 13 books in all which books re-introduced the characters that appeared in the Gem in pre-war days. St. Jim's stories were also published in six Tom Merry Annuals published by Mandeville from 1949 to 1954. Eleven Tom Merry stories were also published in the 1950s by Gold Hawk in paperback form.

Celebrities referred to as \\"superstars\\" may include individuals who work as actors, musicians, athletes, and other media-based professions. History In the 1960s and 1970s, Andy Warhol popularized the term \\"superstar\\" to describe people like actress Mary Woronov The origin of the term in the context of celebrity is uncertain, but a similar expression is attested in John Nyren's 1832 cricket book The Cricketers of My Time. Nyren described the 18th-century cricketer John Small as \\"a star of the first magnitude\\".John Nyren, The Cricketers of my Time, Robson, 1998, p.57. The earliest use of the term \\"superstar\\" has been credited to Frank Patrick in reference to the ice hockey players on his Vancouver Millionaires teams of the 1910s and 1920s, specifically Cyclone Taylor. In the June 1977 edition of Interview magazine, pop artist Andy Warhol was asked by editor Glenn O'Brien who invented the word \\"superstar\\". Warhol, known for popularizing the term, responded, \\"I think it was Jack Smith.\\" O'Brien then asked, \\"And who were the first superstars?\\" Warhol responded, \\"They were all Jack Smith's stars.\\"O‚ÄôBrien, Glenn (June 1977). Interview Magazine. The term received widespread and commonplace use from the title of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar, in particular the 1970 concept album of the musical and the eponymous hit song. \\"Super Star\\" is also the name of a hugely successful rose which Harry Wheatcroft introduced and named in 1960. By 1909, silent film companies began promoting \\"picture personalities\\" by releasing stories about actors to fan magazines and newspapers, as part of a strategy to build \\"brand loyalty\\" for their company's actors and films. By the 1920s, Hollywood film company promoters had developed a \\"massive industrial enterprise\\" that \\"peddled a new intangible‚Äîfame\\". Hollywood \\"image makers\\" and promotional agents planted rumours, selectively released real or fictitious information to the press, and used other \\"gimmicks\\" to create public personas for actors. They then \\"worked [to] reinforce that persona [and] manage the publicity\\". Publicists thus \\"created\\" the \\"enduring images\\" and public perceptions of screen legends such as Rock Hudson, Marilyn Monroe, and Grace Kelly. The development of this \\"star system\\" made fame \\"something that could be fabricated purposely, by the masters of the new 'machinery of glory'\\". In 1976, Mattel produced a \\"Superstar\\" variation of its Barbie doll. According to Sofia Johansson, the \\"canonical texts on stardom\\" include articles by Boorstin (1971), Alberoni (1972), and Dyer (1979) that examined the \\"representations of stars and on aspects of the Hollywood star system\\". Johansson notes that \\"more recent analyses within media and cultural studies (e.g. Gamson 1994; Marshall 1997; Giles 2000; Turner, Marshall and Bonner 2000; Rojek 2001; Turner 2004) have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive, contemporary, 'celebrity culture'\\". In an analysis of \\"celebrity culture\\", Johansson states that \\"fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process, connected to widespread economic, political, technological, and cultural developments\\". In the 1980s and 1990s, entertainment publicity tactics became \\"more subtle and sophisticated\\", such as using press releases, movie junkets, and community activities. These promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research \\"to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures\\". In some cases, publicity agents may create \\"provocative advertisements\\" or make an outrageous public statement to \\"trigger public controversy and thereby generate 'free' news coverage\\". Socio-psychological theories South Korean musician Psy has been referred to as a \\"globalstar\\", with his 2012 \\"Gangnam Style\\" video becoming the first to reach 1 billion views on YouTube According to Roger Caillois, superstars are created by the interplay between \\"mass media, free enterprise, and competition\\". Superstars are produced by a mixture of effort on the part of the superstar and mere chance (due to the many arbitrary factors influencing sports, film releases, etc.) and the superstar usually has \\"extraordinary natural talent augmented by an even more extraordinary perseverance and drive\\". However, small and relative differences are of decisive importance for \\"winning or losing by a hair's breadth\\". It is here that chance plays a role, with Caillois noting that \\"a sudden gust of wind at the end of a yachting race can mean the difference between stardom and defeat\\". He states that the role of chance in superstardom is paradoxical because the west is such a \\"predominantly meritocratic society\\" which champions the importance of hard work, competition, activity, and determination. Caillois states that \\"[since] only one may be first, [a person may] choose to win indirectly through identification with someone else\\" and that the triumph of the superstar as the most popular actor or musician is in part due to the actions of \\"those who worship the hero\\". He says the public believes that the concept of \\"the manicurist elected beauty queen, the sales girl entrusted with the heroine's role in a super production, the shopkeeper's daughter winning the Tour de France, and the gas station attendant who basks in the limelight as a champion toreador\\" represents the possibility from the public's perspective that they too may become wealthy and successful. For example, Levine points out that Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica, was a service station attendant before becoming a wealthy rock star and that Harrison Ford was a cabinet maker before becoming a rich and famous actor. Caillois calls superstars' huge incomes and accolades \\"disguised lotteries\\" and a \\"special kind of game of chance\\". For example, the grand prizes for literary competitions \\"bring fortune and glory to a writer for several years\\". Caillois notes that a superstar cannot merely be successful at some activitythey must also be richly rewarded. He says that the \\"material reward of the superstar is a necessary ingredient (for the glory of the star) for the identification of the public with the star, or whether it is the excellence or the private life of the star which is of more importance\\". He states that superstars' extravagant incomes play an important psychological \\"compensating mechanism\\" role for the public. According to Madow, \\"Fame is a 'relational' phenomenon, something that is conferred by others. A person can, within the limits of his natural talents, make himself strong or swift or learned. But he cannot, in this same sense, make himself famous, any more than he can make himself loved. [...] Fame is often conferred or withheld, just as love is, for reasons and on grounds other than 'merit'. This means that regardless of how strenuously the star may try to 'monitor' and 'shape' it, the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process.\\" Economics of \\"superstars\\" Actor Jackie Chan is one of the most famous people in the world In 1981, Sherwin Rosen examined the economics of superstars to determine why \\"relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage\\" Rosen argues that, in superstar markets, \\"small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue\\".super star: Rajabaskar is the real super star. The Market for Rock Concerts in the Material World. Alan B. Krueger, Princeton University and NBER April 12, 2004 Rosen points out that \\"sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices\\". Microeconomist Alfred Marshall explains that technology has greatly extended the power and reach of the planet's most gifted performers. He referenced a classical of opera singer Elizabeth Billington, a well-acclaimed soprano with a strong voice who could only reach a small audience and naturally did not have access to a microphone or amplifier in 1798, let alone \\"MTV, CDs, iTunes, and Pandora\\". This limited her ability to dominate the market in the way that artists to do today. Marshall wrote, \\"So long as the number of persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited, it is not very likely that any singer will make an advance on the ¬£10,000 said to have been earned in a season by Mrs. Billington at the beginning of the last century, nearly as great [an increase] as that which the business leaders of the present generation have made on those of the last.\\" Furthermore, the trends in popular music indicate that the price of the average concert ticket increased by nearly 400% from 1981 to 2012, much faster than the 150% rise in overall consumer price inflation. Some scholars argue that superstardom plays a useful role in society. Caillois cites Rawls, who states that the \\"premiums earned by scarce natural talents serve to cover the costs of training and to encourage the efforts of learning, as well as to direct ability to where it best furthers the common interest\\". Cowen cites Rosen to argue that \\"the superstar effect is welfare-improving (consumers get better performances) even if it leads to raising income inequality\\" and adds that the \\"superstar phenomenon should not be overstressed [...] indeed, fame is a positive-sum game, not a negative nor a zero-sum one\\". Cowen states that \\"countervailing forces operate, such as a convergence of quality that limits the ability of the very best stars to dominate the market for long, or more radically the elastic supply of fame\\". This means that \\"when demand for fame increases, the numbers of prizes, rewards and whatever fame generating distinctions is rising too\\". On the other hand, it has been argued that \\"compensation systems that resemble prizes [lotteries] can also create perverse incentives by discouraging cooperative behaviour and may encourage some contestants to disrupt the performance of competitors\\". As well, Frank and Cook (1995) called into question \\"the way the winner-take-all markets operate, with their damaging features\\". They argue that the \\"winner-take-all payoff structure [of competition for superstardom] generates a spiral of individual and social occupational waste, since it leads both to increasing (monetary and non-monetary) reward inequalities and to overcrowding in the markets and occupations prone to an overestimation of one's chance to succeed\\". As a result, they argue that \\"when excess numbers of contestants are induced to invest in performance enhancement in order to raise their individual odds of winning, these investments will be mutually offsetting and socially inefficient; end consumers may get more valuable products but the social costs are excessive\\". Other meanings =\\"Superstar\\" art museums= Rajinikanth is the highest paid actor in India and is often referred to as a superstar A small number of major art museums, including Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum, the Centre Pompidou, and Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum, have become household names and major tourist destinations. With their striking, architecturally designed buildings and well-known masterpieces, they have been termed \\"superstar\\" art museums. With their huge visitor traffic, superstar museums are often able to derive a significant income from museum bookshops and restaurants and have a \\"major impact on the local economy\\". Superstar museums are able to use the popular appeal of their location and art holdings to produce their own books, videos, and television specials, which adds an additional revenue stream and further reinforces the public's awareness of the museum. Some superstar museums have also begun establishing museum networks. For example, London's Tate Gallery launched the additional art museums Tate Liverpool and Tate St. Ives. Cultural institutions such as art museums play a \\"gatekeeping\\" role for consumers, helping to screen and grade cultural artefacts and artworks, thus \\"reducing information and search costs\\" for consumers. Moreover, by channelling resources to a limited group of visual artists, cultural institutions also \\"enhance superstar phenomena within the visual arts\\". =Superstar CEOs= McGraw-Hill's economic website argues that the multimillion-dollar salaries of superstar CEOs in the corporate world can be viewed as a type of tournament prize. The huge salaries of these executives \\"often seem to resemble prizes for the winners of contests rather than compensation in return for the value of the marginal product of labour\\". As an example, a company may \\"have many vice-presidents of roughly comparable ability and the vice-president (who may only be slightly more talented than the others) that is promoted to president receives a huge salary increase, which resembles a prize for winning the contest as best VP\\". The article goes on to argue, \\"Such a compensation system may be efficient if the organization is only able to rank its executives according to the relative value of their contribution to the organization (the organization cannot measure the productivity of each executive, only the productivity of the group of executives). [...] Even if executives are paid a wage equal to the average productivity of the group, there will still be an incentive to perform in order be promoted and win the prize.\\" See also *Supercouple References Further reading * Hamlen, William A. \\"Superstardom in Popular Music: Empirical Evidence.\\" Review of Economics and Statistics 73 (1991): 729‚Äì33. * Koutsobinas, Theodore.

He is widely accepted amongst fans as one of the greatest Greek footballers of all time, coming in fourth in the Greek vote for the UEFA Jubilee Awards, first amongst former Olympiacos players.Results of UEFA Jubilee Award votes in Greece Nicknamed the \\"Gianni Rivera of Greece\\", he is also often compared to George Best, due to similarity in appearance and playing style. Though still revered as an Olympiacos legend, he is also well remembered for his switch to arch-rivals Panathinaikos F.C., for the last three years of his playing career, which ended prematurely, when he decided to retire at the age of 29.Delikaris biography at official Olympiacos Website Biography =Early career and move to Olympiacos= Delikaris was born in 1951 and began his career with local club Argonaytis Piraeus FC. His chance to shine came in July 1968, when he was picked to represent Piraeus at an exhibition match against players from Athenian teams. A year later (July 1969) he joined Piraeus giants Olympiacos, the team he supported as a child, for a fee of just over 1 million drachmas along with the exchange of four Olympiacos players. =The Olympiacos years= 1969-70 His debut in the red and white jersey came when he featured in a friendly against his old club. His official debut was against PAOK F.C. in Thessaloniki during a 2-1 win (September 21), while his first goal was scored in a 5-1 win over Chalkida FC (November 5). The 18-year-old forward instantly became a regular and a star a few weeks later, after an excellent display against local rivals Ethnikos, where he scored two goals and was hailed as the new Olympiacos leader. The following months his manager Stjepan Bobek decided to switch him to midfield, despite criticism from a large part of the Greek press. It would soon prove a decision of tactical genius as Delikaris was able to flaunt his rare technical and organising skills, creating goal after goal. 1970-71 The next year saw a number of impressive performances of the young star, along with his debut with the national team in a 3-0 loss at Wembley against England. It also saw the start of his love-hate relationship with the club board, part of which was appointed (as for all teams) by the military regime in power during this troubled period for Greece. He was fined 5 thousand drachmas for staying out late before a game against arch-rivals Panathinaikos. That year he also switched his jersey number 11 for the number he is best remembered with, \\"10\\". 1971-72 The next season (1971‚Äì72) started with him doing his national service. This was to take its toll on the young player who was often sidelined due to exhaustion and injury by manager Alan Ashman. Part of the press started to question his loyalty to the side, followed by part of the club following. Though little is known of details, his life outside the football field continued to challenge the strict morals of the time and land him with fines and punishments, this time a lifetime ban from the national side, which would later be revoked. Even so, Delikaris did not cease to amaze with his footballing abilities, receiving flattering comments from foreign peers. 1972-75 During the 1972-73 preseason camp, Delikaris is given the team's captaincy. Again though his appearances were inconsistent and his injuries frequent. He was later stripped of the captaincy, only to return after apologising to the chairman Nikolaos Goulandris (who was said to adore him), to a series of impressive performances which ended the year in success and a double for Olympiacos. The 1973-74 season was remembered for his catalytic performance in the side's largest ever win against Fostiras with 11-0, and the recapturing of the Championship with a record number of points and goals. While the following season he regained the captaincy and played an important part over the two legs, in the historic aggregate win over Celtic F.C. in the European Champions' Cup. In light of this The Times reported on his technical gifts, commenting that he was well aware of the secrets of football. He also impressed at the international level excelling against West Germany, while enthusiastic reporters hailed him as the only man to dribble Beckenbauer, who later acknowledged his talent. However the season was followed by unrest as Delikaris protested against the poor pay for the club's Greek players, while Goulandris resigned in protest for reasons unknown. On 26/3/75 Delikaris featured in a World's Best XI alongside other legends such as Johan Cruyff, Pele, Jairzinho and his teammate in Olympiacos Milton Viera against R.S.C. Anderlecht, in honor of the Belgian legend Paul Van Himst in an 8-3 loss. The team won the championship which was to be the last for a number of years, followed by news of Delikaris' departure, while he was rumoured to be in talks with Celtic. 1975-78 However, he did show up for the preseason camp amongst his teammates' and fans' jubilation. The season saw him turn in some memorable performances both at club and international level. However the club's serious financial problems caused unrest. Even though in an open letter to the board he declared his willingness to play without pay due to his love of the side, there were constant hints by the press that his persistent injuries that year were due to financial causes rather than medical. In a late season game against PAOK, Delikaris took off his shirt and left in protest of his teammates' performance. Things went downhill from there. The following season saw him inexplicably receive his first red card which caused much protest, because Delikaris had actually been hit by an opponent without reply. Delikaris was well known for his clean footballing style. His relationship with teammates took a downward spiral and in late 1977 they asked for him to be stripped of his captaincy. Soon after he played his last game with Olympiacos against Kavala F.C. (January 8, 1978). =Move to Panathinaikos= Then came the move that shook the foundations of Greek football at the time. Hated arch-rivals Panathinaikos announced the signing of Georgios Delikaris. However, he was never accepted by the fans of Panathinaikos and never seemed to come to terms with the switch himself, often acting out against teammates, managers and fans. In his first game against Olympiacos he had asked not to participate. After being asked to come on as a sub, he walked out of the ground while verbally showing his discontent. Another instance in a game against Olympiacos found him being cheered by Olympiacos fans. During the game, he was constantly engaged in amicable conversation with them, voicing his regret for joining the Athens side. One of his rare moments of glory at Panathinaikos saw him score a spectacular goal against Italian giants Juventus F.C. =End of career= On October 19, 1981 Delikaris retired from professional football for reasons unknown to this day. During his career Delikaris was capped 32 times by the National Football Team of Greece scoring 7 goals. =The legend of Delikaris= Since 1981 Georgios Delikaris pulled himself away from the spotlight, seldom making a public appearance and stayed away from football. Little is known about the circumstances surrounding his departures from Olympiacos and Panathinaikos, and he himself chooses not reveal details. This has elevated him even more to legendary status with the spread of many unsubstantiated stories and anecdotes, relating to those periods as well as his life after football. It is known that he has faced serious financial strife at times and has been involved in the auto-trade business, had lost a large amount of money in the collapse of the Albanian economy in 1997, was the co-owner of a restaurant in his hometown neighborhood and was rumored as of 2009 to be a taxi-driver (though this has been denied by family members).Delikaris interview for Ta Nea =Reemergence= Delikaris reemerged in the spotlight after a number of years giving an informal interview to Greek newspaper Ta Nea (August 25, 1997). Amongst other things Delikaris admitted that it was a mistake to join Panathinaikos and that he was driven by certain enemies within Olympiacos to leave his favorite club, but refused to elaborate. At that time he was a partner in a restaurant. In 2004, he wrote a few articles for the sports newspaper Protathlitis and was said to attend an Olympiacos football game after a great number of years. He later attended an event (November 13, 2005) in his honor at the Olympiacos home ground merchandise store, during which he publicly apologised for moving to Panathinaikos. =Accident and recovery= After this Delikaris' tracks were once again lost. However, on June 26, 2009 Greek football fans were shocked by news that Delikaris was in intensive care at \\"Evangelismos\\", General Hospital with serious injuries sustained during a car accident. Media was flooded with reports on Delikaris' serious condition, while fans flocked to the hospital in support. He made an impressive recovery and was last reported to had left intensive care in good condition and as of June,29 was awaiting to be cleared to return home to his wife and two daughters.

Inspiration is found in the Torah, the Talmud and other classical sources as well as in today's renewal thinkers and groups in Europe, Israel and the United States. Beit Ha'Chidush has strong ties to Jewish Renewal and Reconstructionist Judaism in the United States, Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom, and to Humanistic Judaism. Since its establishment in 1995 Beit Ha‚ÄôChidush has been supported by many progressive rabbis in Europe and the United States. It is an associate member of Liberal Judaism and cooperates with the Dutch Union for Progressive Judaism. A large part of the BHC community hails from outside the Netherlands. The founding members of Beit Ha'Chidush were very much in favor of establishing a new community which was more diverse, open and renewed in comparison to the already existing Jewish communities in the Netherlands.

Career The former defender was no stranger to controversy as a player, his switch from Olympiacos to Panathinaikos in 1990 led to the cancellation of the Greek Super Cup as the authorities feared riots. As a footballer though he played his best years for Panathinaikos being one of the key players behind Club's European runs in 1992 and 1996. He played with Panathinaikos through 1998. He was one of the best defenders his country has ever seen. He could also play as a defensive midfielder. He also spent six months as a coach with Panathinaikos in 2001, before resigning from his position at the end of the year and eventually taking up the task of coaching the Olympic team for Athens 2004. During his playing career, Apostolakis was capped 96 times by the National Football Team of Greece (5 goals) and was a member of the 1994 World Cup squad. His 96 caps stood as a Greek record until it was broken by Theodoros Zagorakis. Personal life Apostolakis is the father of Kostas, who plays as a professional footballer at Panathinaikos.

He scored 57 free kick goals during his career. Career As a youngster, Kostas played for Vouliagmeni. He started his Football A Division career in Panathinaikos, after they picked him up in 1990. He was very quick to adapt and soon made his 1st division debut, in a very successful season, with Panathinaikos winning the double. He made nearly 100 appearances for the Greens - including 11 European games - winning one championship and three cups. In 1994, he was transferred to OFI and spent two seasons there, under coach Eug√®ne Gerards, which he still holds to the highest esteem. He appeared in many games, becoming a mainstay in the Cretan team's midfield. At the second half of 1996/97 season, Frantzeskos left OFI for PAOK. He was one of the many Greek star-players bought at that time by then-PAOK owner Giorgos Batatoudis, along with Zisis Vryzas, Vassilis Borbokis, Spiros Marangos, and others. He was much loved by PAOK fans for his many memorable goals, especially his winner against Arsenal in the first round first leg of the 1997/98 UEFA Cup, in Toumba Stadium. PAOK went on to win the tie 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. He made over 100 appearances with PAOK during his 3-year stay, scoring 45 goals. He also made 12 appearances in the UEFA Cup, scoring 6 times. His standout performances helped him develop a good reputation in Europe especially after having some very good European match performances with PAOK. After turning 31, Kostas left PAOK in 2000 for Kalamata, a much smaller club, then struggling for survival in the 1st Division. His tenure there was rather short, and although making a handful of appearances, he could not help the club stay in the first division. He left the next year for Ionikos, another mid-range club, also battling to avoid relegation. Managing even less appearances than the previous year, Frantzeskos decided to try out the Cypriot League, signing for AEK Larnaca, where he regained some of his former glory. That was not the case, however, when he returned to Greece in 2003, playing half a season for Aris Thessaloniki F.C. and another half for Proodeftiki. In 2003‚Äì2004 Aris narrowly escaped relegation, yet Proodeftiki was not equally lucky - so Frantzeskos finished his 15-year-long career in relative obscurity, playing a season in the Second Division until 2005. Free kicks Frantzeskos holds the record in Greece for the most goals ever scored from direct free- kicks, always using his left foot. He was frequently cited as one of the most accurate free-kick takers in Europe, especially while playing for PAOK. He even scored a few of them in the UEFA Cup, most notably the two against Atl√©tico Madrid, much to keeper Jos√© Francisco Molina's anguish, both home and away. He continued scoring from spot-kicks on to his last days, scoring a few for Proodeftiki. He also holds a rather unusual record of being the only player in Greece to score a hat trick with free-kicks, in the last game of the 1996‚Äì1997 season, with PAOK playing against Kastoria FC. Quite surprisingly, Frantzeskos was very inefficient at scoring from the penalty spot - which led to his famous quote during an interview:\\"Next time we win a penalty, and they want me to take it, i'll ask for a wall\\". National team Frantzeskos debuted for the national team in 1992, in a friendly match against Cyprus, held in Kaftanzoglio Stadium, with Cyprus winning 2‚Äì3. He was an important member of the squad that qualified to the 1994 World Cup. He ended his national years in 2000, again in a friendly match, this time against Austria, held in Kalamata. He has been capped a total 38 times for the Greece, scoring 7 goals.

It comprises the Cantons of Fribourg, Geneva, Vaud and Neuch√¢tel, with the exception of certain parishes of the right bank of the Rh√¥ne belonging to the Diocese of Sion (Sitten). It was created by the merger in 1821 of the Diocese of Lausanne and the Diocese of Geneva, both prince- bishoprics until they were secularized during the Reformation. Until 1924, it was called the Diocese of Lausanne and Geneva. The diocese has its seat at Fribourg; it has 680,000 Catholics, constituting 51% of the population of its district (as of 2004). The current bishop is Charles Morerod, O.P., who was ordained and installed on 11 December 2011. Despite the name, it has no direct link with the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Geneva (400-1801), which was merged into the then Diocese of Chamb√©ry, which was promoted a Metropolitan see but lost former Genevan territory to the bishopric of Lausanne in 1819.  History  = Lausanne = The origin of the See of Lausanne can be traced to the ancient See of Windisch (Vindonissa). Bubulcus, the first Bishop of Windisch, appeared at the imperial Synod of Epaone for th Arelatian Kingdom of Burgundy in 517.Friedrich Maassen, \\"Concilia √¶vi merov.\\" in \\"Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Leges\\", III, I, Hanover, 1893, 15-30 The second and last known Bishop of Windisch was Gramatius (Grammatius), who signed the decrees of the Synods of Clermont in 535,Maassen, \\"Concilia\\", pp. 65‚Äì71 of Orl√©ans, 541,Maassen, \\"Concilia\\", 86-99 and that of Orl√©ans in 549.Maassen, \\"Concilia\\", 99-112 It was generally believed that shortly after this the see was transferred from Windisch to Konstanz, until investigations, particularly by Marius Besson, made it probable that, between 549 and 585, the see was divided and the real seat of the bishops of Windisch transferred to Avenches (Aventicum), while the eastern part of the diocese was united with the Diocese of Konstanz. According to the Synod of M√¢con of 585Maassen, \\"Concilia\\", 163-73 St. Marius seems to have been the first resident Bishop of Avenches. The Chartularium of Lausanneed. G. Waitz in \\"Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores\\", XXIV, Hanover, 1879, 794; also in M√©moires et documents pull, par la Soci√©t√© de la Suisse Romande, VI, Lausanne, 1851, 29 affirms that St. Marius was born in the Burgundian Diocese of Autun about 530, was consecrated Bishop of Avenches in May, 574, and died 31 December, 594.For his epitaph in verse, formerly in the church of St. Thyrsius at Lausanne, see \\"Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores\\", XXIV, 795 To him we owe a valuable addition (455-581) to the Chronicle of St. Prosper of Aquitaine.Patrologia Latina. LXXII, 793-802; also in \\"Mon. Germ.: Auctores Antiquissimi\\", XI, Berlin, 1894,232-39 The episcopal see of Avenches may have been transferred to Lausanne by Marius, or possibly not before 610. Lausanne was originally a suffragan of the archbishopric of Lyon (certainly about the seventh century), later of Besan√ßon, from which it was detached by the French Napoleonic Concordat of 1801. In medieval times the diocese extended from the Aar, near Solothurn, to the northern end of the Valley of St. Imier, thence along the Doubs and the ridge of the Jura Mountains to where the Aubonne flows into Lake Geneva, and thence along the north of the lake to Villeneuve whence the boundary-line followed the watershed between Rh√¥ne and Aar to the Grimsel, and down the Aar to Attiswil. Thus the diocese included the town of Solothurn and part of its territory that part of the Canton of Berne which lay on the left bank of the River Aar, also Biel/Bienne, the Valley of St. Imier, Jougne and Les Longevilles in the Franche-Comt√©, the countships of Neuch√¢tel and Valangin, the greater part of the Canton of Vaud, the Canton of Fribourg, the countship of Gruy√®re and most of the Bernese Oberland. The present Diocese of Lausanne includes the Cantons of Fribourg, Vaud and Neuch√¢tel. Of the bishops who in the seventh century succeeded St. Marius almost nothing is known. Between 594 and 800 only three bishops are known: Arricus, present at the Council of Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne,Maassen, \\"Concilia\\", 208-14 Protasius, elected about 651, and Chilmegisilus, about 670. From the time of Charlemagne until the end of the ninth century the following bishops of Lausanne are mentioned: Udalricus (Ulrich), a contemporary of Charlemagne; Fredarius (about 814); David (827-50), slain in combat with one of the lords of Degerfelden; Hartmann (851-78); Hieronymus (879-92). The most distinguished subsequent bishops are: Heinrich von Lenzburg (d. 1019), who rebuilt the cathedral in 1000; Hugo (1019‚Äì37), a son of Rudolf III of Burgundy, in 1037 proclaimed the \\"Peace of God\\"; Burkart von Oltingen (1057‚Äì89), one of the most devoted adherents of Emperor Henry IV, with whom he was banished, and made the pilgrimage to Canossa; Guido von Merlen (1130‚Äì44), a correspondent of St. Bernard; St. Amadeus of Hauterive, a Cistercian (1144‚Äì59), who wrote homilies in honour of the Blessed Virgin;P. L., CLXXXVIII, 1277‚Äì1348 Boniface of Brussels, much venerated (1230/1-39), formerly a master in the Sorbonne University of Paris and head of the cathedral school at Cologne, resigned because of physical ill- treatment, afterwards auxiliary bishop in Brabant (see Ratzinger in \\"Stimmen aus Maria-Laach\\", L, 1896, 10-23, 139-57); the Benedictine Louis de la Palud (1432‚Äì40), who took part in the Councils of Konstanz (1414), Pavia-Siena (1423) and Basle (1431--) and at the last-named was chosen, in January, 1432, Bishop of Lausanne, against Jean de Prangins, the chapter's choice; Palud was later vice-chamberlain of the conclave whence Amadeus VIII of Savoy emerged as Antipope Felix V, by whom he was made a cardinal; George of Saluzzo, who published synodical constitutions for the reform of the clergy; Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (1472‚Äì76), who in 1503 ascended the papal throne as Julius II. Meanwhile, the prince-bishops of Lausanne, who had been Counts of Vaud since the time of Rudolph III of Burgundy (1011), and until 1218 subject only to imperial authority, were in 1270 granted the status of prince of the Holy Roman Empire, but their temporal power only extended over a small part of the diocese, namely over the city and district of Lausanne, as well as a few towns and villages in the Cantons of Vaud and Fribourg; on the other hand, the bishops possessed many feoffees among the most distinguished of the patrician families of what is now western Switzerland. The guardians of the ecclesiastical property (advocati, avou√©s) of the see were originally the counts of Genevois, then the lords of Gerenstein, the dukes of Z√§hringen, the counts of Kyburg, lastly the counts (later dukes) of Savoy. These guardians, whose only duty originally was the protection of the diocese, enlarged their jurisdiction at the expense of the diocesan rights and even filled the episcopal see with members of their families. Wearisome quarrels resulted, during which the city of Lausanne, with the aid of Berne and Fribourg, acquired new rights, and gradually freed itself from episcopal suzerainty. When Bishop Sebastian de Montfaucon (1517‚Äì60) took sides with the Duke of Savoy in a battle against Berne, the Bernese used this as a pretext to seize the city of Lausanne. On 31 March 1536, Hans Franz N√§geli entered Lausanne as conqueror, abolished Catholicism, and began a religious revolution. The bishop was obliged to flee, the ecclesiastical treasure was taken to Berne, the cathedral chapter was dissolved (and never re-established), while the cathedral was given over to the Swiss Reformed Church. Bishop Sebastian died an exile in 1560, and his three successors were likewise exiles. It was only in 1610, under Bishop Johann VII of Watteville, that the see was provisionally re-established at Fribourg, where it has since remained. The cantons of Vaud, Neuch√¢tel and Berne were entirely lost by the See of Lausanne to the Reformation. By the French revolutionary Constitution Civile du Clerg√© (1790) the Parishes of the French Jura fell to the Diocese of Belley, and this was confirmed by the Concordat of 1801. In 1814 the parishes of Solothurn, in 1828 those of the Bernese Jura, and in 1864 also that district of Berne on the left bank of the Aar were attached to the bishopric of Basle. In compensation, Pius VII assigned, in a papal brief of 20 September 1819, the city of Geneva and twenty parishes belonging to the old Diocese of Geneva (which in 1815 had become Swiss) to the See of Lausanne. The bishop (in 1815 Petrus Tohias Yenni) retained his residence at Fribourg, and since 1821 has borne the title and arms of the Bishops of Lausanne and Geneva. His vicar general resides at Geneva, and is always parish priest of that city. = Lausanne and Geneva = Bishop Yenni died on 8 December 1845 and was succeeded by Etienne Marilley. Deposed in 1848 by the Cantons of Berne, Geneva, Vaud and Neuch√¢tel, owing to serious differences with the Radical regime at Fribourg, Marilley was kept a prisoner for fifty days in the Ch√¢teau de Chillon, on Lake Geneva, and then spent eight years in exile in France; he was allowed to return to his diocese on . In 1864, Pope Pius IX appointed the vicar general of Geneva, Gaspard Mermillod, as an auxiliary bishop. In 1873, Pius IX detached the Genevese territory from the diocese, made it an apostolic vicariate, and appointed Mermillod as vicar apostolic. By this action, Geneva was again severed from the Diocese of Lausanne and Freiburg, contrary to the wishes of the civil authorities, and, it was asserted, the wishes of a majority of the Catholic population. The Apostolic Vicariate of Geneva was not recognized by either the State Council of Geneva or the Swiss Federal Council, and Mermillod was banished from Switzerland by a decree. When the Holy See condemned this measure, the Government answered, on , by expelling the Nuncio. After Marilley had resigned his diocese in 1879, Monsignor Christophore Cosandey, Provost at Fribourg's seminary, was elected Bishop of Lausanne and Geneva, and after his death, Mermillod. The Apostolic Vicariate of Geneva was given up, the conflict with the Government ended, and the decree of expulsion against Mermillod was revoked. In 1890, Pope Leo XIII made Mermillod a cardinal and he moved to Rome. Monsignor Joseph D√©ruaz was named as his successor. =Reports of sex abuse= On July 15, 2020, a Vatican investigation revealed that the number of reported cases of abuse involving Catholic priests and monks serving in the Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg have been increasing over the past few years and that the payment of financial compensation which people in the Diocese distributed for victims of abuse totaled CHF675,000 ($718,000) in 2018 - up from CHF425,000 in the previous year - according to figures released by the Vatican News. However, another Catholic Church inquiry found the Bishop Charles Morerod did not protect a former priest in the Diocese who was facing sex abuse allegations, but that he instead \\"downplayed\\" the seriousness of the allegations when they were reported to him.https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/investigation-clears-bishop-in-sex-abuse- case/45905670 The accused former priest, who submitted his resignation the previous month, was alleged to have sexually abused a 17-year-old and molested a fellow priest between 1998 and 2011.

(3 Nov 2011 Appointed ‚Äì )  Statistics  According to B√ºchi (see bibliography) and the Dictionnaire g√©ographique de la Suisse (Neuch√¢tel, 1905), III, 49 sqq., the diocese numbered approximately 434,049 Protestants and 232,056 Catholics; consequently, the latter formed somewhat more than one-third of the whole population of the bishopric. The Catholics inhabit principally the Canton of Fribourg (excepting the Lake District) and the country parishes transferred to Geneva in 1515, four communes in the Canton of Neuch√¢tel, and ten in the Canton of Vaud. The Catholic population in the Cantons of Fribourg and Geneva consisted principally of farmers, in both of the other cantons it is also recruited from the labouring classes. The Catholics were distributed among 193 parishes, of which 162 allotted to Lausanne, 31 to Geneva. The number of secular priests was 390, those belonging to orders 70. Among the more important educational establishments of diocese, besides those already mentioned, are: the University of Fribourg ; the theological seminary of St. Charles at Fribourg, with seven ecclesiastical professors; the cantonal school of St. Michel, also at Fribourg, which comprises a German and French gymnasium, a Realschule (corresponding somewhat to the English first-grade schools) and commercial school, as well as a lyceum, the rector of which was a clergyman. This school had in 1910 about 800 pupils, with 40 ecclesiastical and as many lay professors. Three other cantonal universities existed in the diocese: Geneva (founded by Calvin in 1559, and in 1873 raised to the rank of a university with five faculties); Neuch√¢tel (1866, academy; 1909, university); Lausanne (1537, academy; university since 1890, with five faculties). Geneva and Lausanne both have cantonal Protestant theological faculties, Neuch√¢tel a \\"Facult√© de th√©ologie de l'√©glise ind√©pendante de l'√©tat\\". For the government of the diocese there were, besides the bishop, two vicars-general, one living at Geneva, the other at Fribourg. There were, moreover, a provicarius generalis, who is also chancellor of the diocese, and a secretary. The cathedral chapter of Lausanne (with 32 canons was suppressed at the time of the Protestant Reformation and has never been re-established, in consequence of which the choice of a bishop rests with the Holy See. In 1512 Julius II established a collegiate chapter in the church of St. Nicholas at Fribourg, which is immediately subject to the Holy See, with a provost appointed by the Great Council, also a dean, a cantor and ten prebendaries. This collegiate church took the place of the diocesan cathedral, lacking since the cathedral of St. Pierre at Geneva and that of Notre-Dame at Lausanne were given over to Protestantism at the time of the Reformation.

Eventually, Konstantinou became the first team's keeper, a position he held until the 1983 season. He ended his career in 1984, playing for OFI. During his career, Konstantinou was capped 28 times by the Greek National Football Team. He was the keeper for Greece during the Euro 1980 finals.

He introduced the collective intelligence concept in his 1994 book L'intelligence collective: Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace (Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace).L'intelligence collective. Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace, Paris, La D√©couverte, 1994 () L√©vy's 1995 book, Qu'est-ce que le virtuel? (translated as Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age) develops philosopher Gilles Deleuze's conception of \\"the virtual\\" as a dimension of reality that subsists with the actual but is irreducible to it. In 2001, he wrote the book Cyberculture. Pierre L√©vy currently teaches at the communication department of the University of Ottawa, where he holds a Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence. L√©vy is fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and received several awards and academic distinctions. Life and work Pierre L√©vy is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of cyberspace and digital communications. L√©vy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace.Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace Perseus, 1999. As early as 1990 L√©vy published a book about the merging of digital networks and hypertextual communication. L√©vy's theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of wikipedia and anticipates wikinomics, and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems. From 1993 to 1998 L√©vy was Professor at the University of Paris VIII, where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about cyberculture. He was a member of the editorial board of the Revue virtuelle project of the Pompidou Center in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996. In the chapter Interactivity from his book Cyberculture (2001), L√©vy argues that analogue communication (telephone, mail) differs from digital communication (email, chat) in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that interactivity is a vague term that \\"has more to do with finding the solution to a problem, the need to develop new ways to observe, design, and evaluate methods of communication, than it does with identifying a simple, unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system\\".L√©vy, Pierre. \\"Cyberculture\\". Univ. of Minnesota Press. 2001, p. 228. () Henry Jenkins, among others, cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence. In Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age L√©vy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives, from real time (media) interaction through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions. And in each case the mechanism is the same: we create some artifact, more or less material, which allows us to shift what's at stake away from the immediate here-and-now and towards a problematic where new possibilities open up. Current project L√©vy's current project focuses on the development of an Information Economy MetaLanguage (IEML) for the purposes of improving knowledge management as part of his works on the design of a universal system for semantic addressing of digital documents.

Traditionally, the model has been used for children or young people who cannot live with their families or afford their own homes, people with chronic disabilities who may be adults or seniors, or people with dementia and related aged illnesses. Typically, there are no more than six residents, and there is at least one trained caregiver there 24 hours a day. In some early \\"model programs\\", a house manager, night manager, weekend activity coordinator, and four part-time skill teachers were reported.Close, D.W. (1977). Community living for severely and profoundly retarded adults: A group home study. Education and Training of the Mentally Retarded, 12(3): 256‚Äì262. Originally, the term group home referred to homes of 8 to 16 individuals, which was a state-mandated size during deinstitutionalization. Residential nursing facilities, also included in this article, may be as large in 2015 as 100 individuals, which is no longer the case in field such as intellectual and developmental disabilities.Cain, K. (1982, May 12). Small group setting best for severely retarded, experts say. Syracuse Herald American. Syracuse, NY via Syracuse University's Center on Human Policy 1971‚Äì1989 newspaper collection. Depending on the severity of the condition requiring one to need to live in a group home, some clients are able to attend day programs and most clients are able to live normal lifestyles. The group homes highlighted in news articles in the late 1970s and 1980s,Slackman, M. (1988, February 27). Immediate increase sought in group homes. Gannett Westchester Newspapers, p. 7. and by the late 2000s, have been cited internationally as a symbol or emblem of the community movement. Group homes were opened in local communities, often with site selection hearings, by state government and non-profit organizations including the international L'Arche, the local chapters of the Arc of the United States (then Association for Children), United Cerebral Palsy local agencies, agencies belonging to state associations such as ACLAIMH (Association of Community Living Administrators in Mental Health), and NYSACRA (New York State Association of Community Residence Administrators) in New York, and new, non-profit organizations in the field of mental health. Group homes are one category in a broader array, spectrum, continuum, or services systems plan for residential community services or Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS). Another context in which the expression ‚Äúgroup home‚Äù is used is referring to residential child care communities and similar organizations, providing residential services as part of the foster care system. There is a considerable variety of different models, sizes and kinds of organizations caring for children and youth who cannot stay with their birth families.Babic, B., & Pluto, L. (2007). Participation in residential child care in Germany. Scottish Journal of Residential Child Care, 6(2), 32. Types and typologies A group home in a local community is what the government and universities term a \\"small group home.\\" Group homes always have trained personnel, and administration located both for the home and outside the home at office locations. Larger homes often are termed residential facilities, as are campuses with homes located throughout a campus structure. K. C. Lakin of the University of Minnesota, a deinstitutionalization researcher, has indicated that a taxonomy of residential facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities includes program model, size and operator, and facilities also then vary by disability and age, among other primary characteristics. Prior residential facility classifications were described by Scheerenberger until the modern day classification by David Braddock on a state-by-state basis which includes individuals in residential settings of six or fewer, one categorical group.Hill, B. & Lakin, K.C. (1986, April). Classification of residential facilities for individuals with mental retardation. Mental Retardation, 24(2): 107‚Äì115.Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Rizzolo, M.C., Tanis, E., Haffer, L., Lulinski, A. & Wu, J. (2013). State of the States in Developmental Disabilities 2013: The Great Recession and its Aftermath. Denver, CO: Department of Psychiatry and Colemand Institute, University of Colorado, Department of Disability and Human Development, University of Illinois- Chicago, and American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. In 2014, typologies of residential services in intellectual disabilities include new categories of supported living, personal assistance services, individual and family support, and supported employment. =Residents and services= Residents of group homes usually have a disability, such as autism, intellectual disability, chronic or long-term mental/psychiatric disorder, or physical or multiple disabilities because those are the non-profit and state-regional organizations which began and operated the homes. Some group homes were funded as transitional homes to prepare for independent living (in an apartment or return to family or marriage and employment), and others were viewed as permanent community homes. Society may prevent people with significant needs from living in local communities with social acceptance key to community development. The residents sometimes need continual or supported assistance in order to complete daily tasks, such as taking medication or bathing, making dinners, having conversations, making appointments, and getting to work or a day service. Group homes were revolutionary in that they offered individuals life opportunities to learn to cook and prepare meals (e.g., individuals with severe and even \\"profound\\" disabilities), budget their personal allowance, select photos for their room or album, meet neighbors and \\"carry out civic duties,\\" go grocery shopping, eat in restaurants, make emergency calls or inquiries, and exercise regularly.Dever, R (1989). A taxonomy of community living skills. Exceptional Children, 55(5): 395-404.Schleien, S., Ash, T., Kiernan, J. & Wehman, P. (1981, Summer).

Education and Training of the Mentally Retarded, 18(4): 279‚Äì286.Van Den Pol, R., Iwata, B., Ivanic, M., Page, T., Neef, N., & Whitley, F. Paul. (1981).

Training mentally retarded adults to make emergency telephone calls. Behavior Modification, 4(4): 513‚Äì525. Some residents may also have behavioral problems that require a better daily routine, medical assessment for possible health care needs (e.g., pituitary problem, medication adjustment), environmental changes (e.g., different roommates), mental health counseling, specialist or physician consultation, or supervision; government may require a finding of involuntary care (i.e. dangerous to themselves or others) which is a hotly contested and disputed arena. Individuals who move from psychiatric hospitals (and intellectual disability institutions) also may need medications reduced, with psychiatric symptoms often only moderately addressed (\\"modest efficacy\\") in this manner with known side effects of long- term use. The community living movement has been very successful in the US and other countries, and is supported in 2015 by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006).United Nations ENABLE. (2006). UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. NY, NY: Author.Brown, S. (2014). International Agenda on Disability and Human Rights. In: J. Racino, Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US. (pp. 279‚Äì296). London: CRC Press. Prior to the 1970s this function was served by institutions, asylums, poorhouses, and orphanages until long-term services and supports, including group homes were developed in the US. The primary frameworks in the US underlying group homes are often termed social and functional competency-based (e.g., community participation, social role valorization, social and community acceptance, self-determination, functional home and community skills) and another, positive behavioral supports (which may be considered overly structured for homes and home life). Positive behavioral supports were developed, in part, to assist with \\"management problems\\" of the residential facilities.Bruininks, R., Kudle, M., Wieck, C. & Hauber, F. (198, June). Management problems in community residential facilities. Mental Retardation, 18: 125‚Äì130 Group home residents may be found in workplaces, day services, parks and recreation programs, schools, shopping centers, travel locations, and with family, neighbors, community workers, coworkers, schoolmates, and friends. In addition, new laws required that schools serve disabled children (often obfuscated as \\"special needs\\" or \\"exceptional children\\") adapting school and afterschool programs to meet the needs of the previously excluded population groups.Ford, A., Brown, L., Pumpian, I., Baumgart, D., Nisbet, J., Schroeder, J. & Loomis, R. (nd). Strategies for developing individualized recreation and leisure programs for severely handicapped students. Adapted from Brown et al, (1980). Curricular Strategies for Teaching Severely Handicapped Student Functional and Nonfunctional Skills in School and NonSchool Environments. Vol. X. Madison, WI: Madison Metropolitan School District. Douglas Biklen in his award-winning \\"Regular Lives\\" highlighted 3 schools in Syracuse, New York integrating severely disabled children in conjunction with his new book, Achieving the Complete School: Strategies for Effective Mainstreaming.Geddes, D.J. (1988, September 1). Award-winning \\"Regular Lives\\" to be seen nationally on PBS. The Syracuse Record. Syracuse, NY. =Residential treatment facilities= People who live in a group home offering support services may be developmentally disabled, recovering from alcohol or drug addiction (e.g., who may have attended a youth drug court hosted by the judicial system), abused or neglected youths, youths with behavioral or emotional problems, and/or youths with criminal records (e.g., a person in need of supervision). Group homes or group facilities may also provide residential treatment for youth for a time- limited period, and then involve return of the youth to the family environment.Shaw, K. & Garfat, T. (2003). From front line to family home: A youth care approach to working with families. Child and Family Services, 25(1/2): 39‚Äì65. Similarly, drug, addictions and alcohol programs may be time- limited, and involve residential treatment (e.g., Afrocentric model for 24 women and children, as part of Boston Consortium of Services).Amaro, H., McGraw, S., Larson, M., Lopez, L., & Nieves, R. (2004). Boston Consortium of Services for Families in Recovery: A trauma-informed intervention model for women's alcohol and drug addiction treatment. In: B. Veysey & C. Clark, Responding to Physical and Sexual Abuse in Women with Alcohol and Other Drug and Mental Disorders. (pp. 95‚Äì119). Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press. Residential treatment for children with mental health needs Residential treatment centers and other organized mental health care for children with emotional needs, among our highest health and human service efforts, was reported at 440 organizations nationally in 1988, representing 9% of mental health organizations.US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute on Mental Health.

Outcomes of an individualized family support program. Journal of Leisurability, 22(4): 22‚Äì32. Residential treatment is one part of an array of community services which include therapeutic foster care, family support, case management, crisis-emergency services, outpatient and day services, and home-based services.Kutash, K. & Rivera, V. (1996). \\"What Works in Children's Mental health Services? Uncovering Answers to Critical Questions.\\" Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. During this period, residential treatment was also compared to supported housing, also called supportive housing for its role in comprehensive service system developments, though often for adults who may need or desire services.Fields, S. (1990, April). The relationship between residential treatment and supported housing in a comimunity system of services. \\"Psychosocial Rehabilitation\\", 13(4): 105‚Äì114. =Community resources and neighborhoods= Group homes have a good community image, and were developed in the intellectual disability and mental health fields as a desirable middle class option located in good neighborhoods after a faulty start in poorer neighborhoods in the US. Group homes were often built in accordance with principle of normalization (people with disabilities), to blend into neighborhoods, to have access to shopping, banks, and transportation, and sometimes, universal access and design.Gothelf, C. (1987). The availability of community resources to group homes in New York City. (pp. 146‚Äì164). In: R.F. Antonak & J. A. Mullick, Transitions in Mental Retardation Volume 3: The Community Imperative Revisited. Norwood, NJ: ABLEX Publishing.Baker, B.L., Seltzer, G.B. & Seltzer, M.M. (1977). Ch. 3: Small group home. As Close as Possible: Community Residences for Retarded Adults. Boston: Little, Brown & Co. Group homes may be part of residential services \\"models\\" offered by a service provider together with apartment programs, and other types of \\"followalong\\" services.Racino, J. (2000). Ch. 3: From residential services to housing and support. Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support. (pp. 47‚Äì72). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers. Yet, in 2015, the homes and personnel continue to meet the challenges of a changing multicultural society, and changing and norms in areas such as gender expectations.Nutter, D. & Reid, D. (1978). Teaching retarded women a clothing selection skill using community norms. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 11: 475‚Äì487. =Halfway houses and intermediate care facilities= A group home differs from a halfway house, the latter which is one of the most common terms describing community living opportunities in mental health in the 1970s' medical and psychiatric literatures. Specialized halfway houses, as half way between the institution and a regular home, may serve individuals with addictions or who may now be convicted of crimes, though very uncommon in the 1970s. Residents are usually encouraged or required to take an active role in the maintenance of the household, such as performing chores or helping to manage a budget. In 1984, New York's state office in intellectual and developmental disabilities described its service provision in 338 group homes serving 3,249 individuals.Jacobson, J., Silver, E. & Schwartz, A.(1984, October). Service provision in New York's group homes. Mental Retardation, 22(5): 231‚Äì259. Some of these homes were certified as intermediate care facilities (ICF-MRs) and must respond to stricter facility-based standards. Residents may have their own room or share rooms, and share facilities such as laundry, bathroom, kitchen, and common living areas. The opening of group homes in neighborhoods is occasionally opposed by residents due to ableist fears that it will lead to a rise in crime and/or a drop in property values. However, repeated reviews since the 1970s indicate such views are unfounded, and the homes contribute to the neighborhoods. In the late 1970s, local hearings were conducted in states such as New York, and parents of children with disabilities (e.g., Josephine Scro in the Syracuse Post Standard on June 7, 1979), research experts, agency directors (e.g., Guy Caruso of the Onondaga County Arc, now at Temple University) and community-disability planners (late Bernice Schultz, county planner) spoke with community members to respond to their inquiries. The late Josephine Scro later became a director of a new family support agency in Syracuse, New York, to assist other families with children with disabilities with family supports in their own homes and local communities, too.\\"Retarded adult\\" home proposed for DeWitt.(1979, June 1). Syracuse Post-Standard, Page 8-East.Racino, J. A. (1998). Innovations in family support: What are we learning? Journal of Child and Family Studies, 7(4): 433‚Äì449. =Foster care and family support for children= A group home can also refer to family homes in which children and youth of the foster care system are placed, sometimes until foster families are found for them, sometimes for long-term care. Homes which are termed group foster care operate under other standards than those termed group homes, including different management systems and departments. Unrelated children or sibling groups live in a home-like setting with either a set of house parents or a rotating staff of trained caregivers. Specialized therapeutic or treatment group homes are available to meet the needs of children with emotional, intellectual, physical, medical and/or behavioral difficulties. Group homes for children provide an alternative to traditional foster care, though family support to the birth, adoptive, and foster families are often first recommended.Taylor, S.J., Lakin, K.C., & Hill, B. (1989). Permanency planning for children and youth: Out-of-home placement decisions. Exceptional Children, 55(6):541-549. Several sources state that, in comparison to other placement alternatives, this form of care is the most restrictive for youth in the foster care system. The term group home is often confused with lock-down treatment centers, which are required to have eyes-on every so often due to behavioral and mental challenges of the children and youth they serve. There are also less restrictive forms of group homes, which often use the house parent model. Those organizations are due to their visual comparability to several foster families within a certain area as well as their connectedness to each other, the community and internally best described as residential child care communities. Group homes and foster homes have been compared and studied in national samples.Lakin, K.C., Bruininks, R., Chen, T., Hill, B. & Andersen, D. (1993).

Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy, Research and Training Center on Community Integration. =Supportive community options for adults with disabilities= Newer options of group living were often termed supported living, supported housing, individual and family supports, or early on, \\"individualized supportive living arrangements\\" (e.g., apartment programs).Racino, J.

These developments often followed analyses of homes as homes,Racino, J., Walker, P., O'Connor, S. & Taylor, S. (1993). Housing, Support and Community. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. ordinary housing and support services, versus group treatment or facilities, an important critique during the 1980s and 1990s reform period. Independent living continued to be a primary framework representing another emblem of community living more often associated with personal assistance and live-in attendants, home health services, and the now termed allied health services of physical and occupational therapy, speech, cognitive therapy, and psychological counseling.Condeluci, A., Cooperman, S. & Self, B.A. (1987). Independent living: Settings and supports. (pp. 301-347). In: M. Ylivasker & E. Gobble, Community Re-Entry for Head Injured Adults. Boston, MA: Little, Brown & Co. However, leading psychiatric survivors examined independent living in the context of supportive housing and necessary support services which did not need to be congregated in housing.Harp, H. T. (1990, April). Independent living with support services: The goal and future for mental health consumers. \\"Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal\\", 13(4): 85‚Äì90. =Group options for seniors with disabilities= Perhaps the largest group of group homes (now termed community residential services or residential care by other managements) fall under the heading of residential care homes for seniors, or both seniors and individuals with disabilities. Residential care categories include over 43 separate regulated categories by state governments and now have the new assisted living growing in the US. Group facilities (e.g., funded as large as 100 individuals in a nursing facility or on old-style campus of over 12 wards on the outskirts of cities) or homes for seniors (e.g., room and board) are designed for seniors who cannot live on their own due to physical or mental disabilities. Group facilities, which may involve over half of the allotted beds or more (80%) funded by Medicaid, might also be found under Residential Care Home, Residential Care Facility for the Elderly, or Assisted Living Facility. Alternative community options for these seniors are home health care, hospice care, specialized care (e.g., Alzheimer's), day care at senior centers, meals on wheels, transportation drivers, and other aging and disability options.Racino, J. (2014), Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US. NY, NY: CRC Press. Civil rights In most countries, people can still vote in election and attend higher education while in a group home. Internet usage in group homes, however, may be severely limited (if not prohibited outright). Trips to public libraries may vary depending on the distance from the group home to the library. While 93% of the Canadian population has easy access to a public library,Schrader, Alvin M. and Brundin, Michael R. 2002. \\"National Core Library Statistics Program Statistical Report, 1999: Cultural and Economic Impact of Libraries on Canada.\\" p.15 it is uncertain about the percentage of Canadian group home residents who actually have unrestricted access to a public library in lieu of watching television. =Employment and the Americans with Disabilities Act= Employment opportunities, where available, are encouraged for group home residents, depending on the home, operator, and characteristics of the residents. Since the 1970s, people with cognitive or mental health disabilities have been involved in community employment of all kinds and also have developed freestanding affirmative industries and supported employment services in conjunction with the government.Hill, M., Wehman, P., Kregel, J., Banks, P. D., & Metzler, H. (1987). Employment outcomes for people with moderate and severe disabilities: An eight-year longitudinal analysis of supported competitive employment. JASH, 12(3): 182-189. These rights are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, now revised in 2008 Blanck, P. (2000). Employment, Disability and the Americans with Disabilities Act: Issues in Law, Public Policy and Research. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. Human rights laws, still operational in states, govern employment applications for employment, and the employer is restricted from asking pre-employment questions on criminal arrests or discriminating on this basis (See, Human Rights Laws of the state of New York). However, unbeknownst to many communities and organizations, management rights, instead of human rights, have been inserted in contracts in the US.Racino, J. & Whittico, P. (1998). The promise of self-advocacy and community employment. In: Wehman, P. & Kregel, J., More than a Job: Securing Satisfying Careers for People with Disabilities. (pp. 47‚Äì69). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. =Mental health and civil rights= In the US it has been the position of state mental health commissioners that many people who are living independently should be placed in intensive treatment, as described in a mid-1980s article in the Community Mental Health Journal. The authors held that only 12 of 3,068 individuals should be living independently (p. 199) based on their model predictions.Shern, D.L., Wilson, N., Ellis, R., Bartsch, D. & Coen, A. (1986, Fall). Planning a continuum of residential service settings for the chronically mentally ill: The Colorado experience. Community Mental Health Journal, 22(3): 190‚Äì202. In contrast, the continuum model has been critiqued as restrictive of rights, facility-based, and restrictive of community participation Taylor, S.J., Racino, J., Knoll, J. & Lutfiyya, Z.M. (1987). The Nonrestrictive Environment: On Community Integration of Persons with Severe Disabilities. Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press. resulting in a US Supreme Court decision recognizing the most integrated setting (Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, 2012). Increasingly, concern has been voiced over the rise in community treatment orders, medical homes, invasive supervision in homes, in addition to decades of outcry over involuntary procedures in psychiatry in the US and restrictions on human rights. In this field, no viable recourse exists for reversing actions by personnel, including professional and medical malpractice, and the most successful programs are viewed as those that result in high compliance.Burns, T. (2010, April). The rise and fall of assertive community treatment. International Review of Psychiatry, 22(2): 130-137. High medication usage is required, often against the law, and the situation worsens during any police-enforced confinement. Group homes in the non-profit sector are often operated by other than the providers involved in state or private, for-profit involuntary care. =Nursing facility industry= The nursing facility industry holds the position, often with its affiliated hospitals, that it decides on involuntary treatment of elders, which involves issues such as visitations. Nursing homes have had a very long history of reviews and complaints including to the federal level of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the US and have been the subject of major reform efforts. Today, a Red Cross ombudsman may be available in the homes, special needs units may be available to assist in areas such as bathing and eating, and in some cities, short term rehabilitation is provided for seniors at those sites instead of at community locations. Nursing facilities, unlike the small size standard of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for homes for individuals with intellectual disabilities, may have over 100 \\"institutional clients\\" on site and is reporting 2‚Äì3% restraint use. Education and training Group home personnel are considered in 2015 to be Direct Support Professionals Larson, S., Sedelzky, L., Hewitt, A., & Blakeway, C., (2014).

NY, NY: CRC Press. though paramount in this approach are maintaining a home atmosphere, routines, and community life. An abundance of literature in the 1980s and 1990s described the training needs of personnel,Gage, M., Fredericks, B., Johnson-Dorn, N. & Linley-Southard, B. (1982).

(2011). Sef-directed services: Communities and long-term supports. Washington, DC: Author. =Cultural and professional helping skills= Foundational in all helping professions are what are called \\"critical skill domains,\\" which are congruent with a community support approach (e.g., values clarification, general fluency and flexibility of thought, perception and response, competence in academic content, verbal communications) (Cole & Lacefield, 1978).Cole, H. & Lacefield, W.

(1990, April). Participants, community volunteers and staff: A collaborative approach to housing and support. \\"Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal\\", 13(4): 81‚Äì84.

(2004). Gay Men Living with Chronic Illness and Disabilities: From Crisis to Crossroads. London: Haworth Press. including HIV- AIDS which may be addressed in supported housing options. Attention is also paid to developing residential services which meet the preferences of persons with serious mental illness and their families.Rogers, E.S., Danley, K., Anthony, W.A., Martin, R., & Walsh, D. (1994). The residential needs and preferences of persons with serious mental illness: A comparison of consumers and family members. The Journal of Mental Health Administration, 21(1): 42‚Äì51. =Independent living and brain/head injury services= Education and training in independent living from long-term care institutions (e.g., acute care facilities, long-term rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing or intermediate care facilities, community re-entry facilities) often involved changing from forced dependency to controlling and deciding one's own destiny called self-determination. Life skills ranged from health and hygiene, parenting/child care, home maintenance, money management, activities of daily living, community awareness and mobility, legal awareness, social/interpersonal skills, and family involvement (Condeluci, Cooperman, & Self, 1987).Condeluci, A., Cooperman, S. .& Self, B.A. (1987). Independent living: Settings and supports. (pp. 301‚Äì347). In: M. Ylivasker & E. Gobble, Community Re-Entry for Head Injured Adults. Boston, MA: Little, Brown, & Co. These services may be called post-acute services, and involve other personnel models, such as life coaches (Jones, Patrick, Evans, & Wuff, 1991).Jones, M., Patrick, P. D., Evans, R.W. & Wuff, J.J. (1991). The life coach model of community re-entry. In: B. McMahon & L. Shaw, Work Worth Doing. Orlando, FL: Paul M. Deutsch. Independent living training has also proved effective in addressing the needs and expectations of individuals who have sensory impairments (e.g., hearing or blindness).Iceman, D. & Dunlop, W. (1984). Independent living skills training: A survey of current practices. Journal of Rehabilitation, 50: 53‚Äì56. Cost of residential services Residential services costs have been studied in depth in areas that relate to group homes, family care homes or community residential services, especially on deinstitutionalization, Medicaid home and community-based waiver development, and community development.Rizzolo, M., Friedman, C., Lulinski-Norris, A. & Braddock, D. (2013). HCBS waivers: A nationwide study of states: Intellectual and developmental disabilities. American Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 51(1): 1‚Äì21.Lewis, D. & Johnson, D.

Philadelphia, PA: Temple University. Residential treatment, often provided in larger facilities, may be higher in reimbursement rates to the provider so treatment billings will be found for higher-cost professional services (e.g., behavioral health). Surprisingly, except for very small sizes, the larger, medicalized facilities bill the highest costs per individual (e.g., intermediate care facilities over 16 in the state of New York).American Association for Retired Persons. (2012). Across the States: Profiles of Long-Term Services and Supports.(9th Edition). Washington, DC: Public Policy Institute. =Individual and family costs of services= In relationship to the individual or family, residential services are expensive for low or middle-class families, and federal, state and local government often contribute to these costs. Medicaid- funded options may require use of assets, and Social Security Disability or Social Security are also part of payment plans. New options called family- directed and user-directed involve transfer of funds to homes and families, and continue to be in process in states. Early organizations provided information on their management and financing to help local communities replicate or begin their own homes and programs.Romer, L.T. (1987). Neighborhood Living Project Management and Finance Training Package. Eugene, OR: University of Oregon, Center on Human Development, Cost:$5.00 =Residential care, assisted living, supported housing= Residential care homes, run by the government or by the for-profit and non-profit industries, need not be low cost and/or low quality as many might initially guess, though traditional room and boards may be based primarily on a Social Security Disability payment and limited governmental personnel assistance. More expensive residential care homes now exist to offer a family-style, high quality, care option to the next class of senior care which is Assisted Living Facilities. These homes, operated often by the nursing care industry, are based on increasing need for assistance and decreasing independence. Unlike the proposals for upgraded community services in homes and communities for seniors with substantial needs, assisted living was primarily developed as facility types only; supported housing also was a new model as state initiatives.Pynoos, J., Liebig, P., Alley, D., & Nishita, C. (2004). Homes of choice: Towards more effective linkages between housing and support. In: J. Pynoos, P. Hollander Feldman, & J. Ahrens, Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults: Obstacles, Opportunities and Options. (pp. 5‚Äì39). Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press. =Seniors, disability and aging= There are various levels of residential care homes for seniors, which is the traditional medical system of assessments, which differs from developing person-centered plans and support services for persons who may have substantial health care needsMcGowan, K. (2002). Beyond getting sick. In: J. O'Brien & C.L. O'Brien, Implementing Person-Centered Planning. (pp. 215‚Äì230). Toronto, Canada: Inclusion Press. and also from new managed Medicaid care plans. In addition, in some fields, the plan is for the individual to age in place in their group home setting. Personal care assistance is often associated with aging in place and independent living services; local governments have been reluctant to pay for other than limited services in the homes (one study stated up to 20 hours maximum, others 3‚Äì4 hours per week), in spite of a nationwide decades press toward our own governments. This position is similar to a governmental position to pay not for ordinary goods, but only for specialized services. However, senior services of other kinds, including the senior centers,Beisgen, B. & Kroitchman, M. (2003). Senior Centers: Opportunities for Successful Aging. NY, NY: Springer Publishing Co. low cost meals, transportation, Veteran's health services and independent clubs, specialized day care (e.g., day care for older adult policies in Great Britain),Clark, C. (2001). Adult Day Services and Social Inclusion. Aberdeen, UK: Robert Gordon University and London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.Force, L. & O'Malley, M. (1998). Adult day services. (pp. 294‚Äì315). In: M Janicki, A. J. Dalton, \\"Dementia, Aging and Intellectual Disabilities: A Handbook.\\" Castleton, JY: Hamilton Printing Co. local case managers, local Offices of the Aging (with Disability coordinators in some locations), and so forth are often available. Senior programs may also involve joint integration initiatives by aging and disability agencies resulting in leading programs such as social model day programs in Oneida County, New York, Rhode Island's Apartment Residence, Madison County Integration Program, and supported retirement programs in the state of Utah.Janicki, M. & Keefe, R. (1992). \\"Casebook: Integration Experiences.\\" Albany, NY: New York State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. Assisted living is a modernization effort (e.g., more choices or menus of services) in the nursing care fields which primarily resulted in modernization, to some extent, of the large facility (i.e., nursing homes) or campus models. Large state initiatives can be found in Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults representing response to long-term criticism of a facility-based service industry.Pynoos, J., Feldman Hollander, P., & Ahrens, J. (2004). \\"Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults: Obstacles, Options and Opportunities\\". (pp. 5‚Äì39). Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press. However, a recent nursing industry schema, reflecting a provider network, for levels of care states: \\"Assisted Living With no Assistance\\" (the most common use of \\"assisted living\\" involves little or no assistance, living at home with minimal amounts of home care), \\"Assisted Living with Assistance\\", and \\"Assisted Living - Memory Care\\". Memory care is for those dealing with memory loss, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease. However, the call nationwide is for caregiving services in the homes where aging parents often move to live with their adult children and their families. The provider sector desired are those that respect the wishes of the individual and the family, including for care at home through hospice. The New Politics of Old Age Policy (Robert Hudson, 2005/2010) calls for the government entertaining care credits or generous minimum benefits to assist US families to juggle paid and unpaid work in today's modernized world.Hudson, R. (2005/2010). The New Politics of Old Age Policy (2nd edition). Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins. In addition, as parents age, adults with disabilities who may be living at home will also need assistance that might not have been needed earlier (e.g., siblings, new home).

It has a wide tarmacked surface, and was used for 2.4 million trips in 2007, increasing by 10% per year. It was built by the cycling charity Sustrans between 1979 and 1986, which leased a stretch near Saltford, with the help of the then Avon County Council, and using volunteers turned it into its first cycleway. Route The path follows the route of the Midland Railway Mangotsfield and Bath branch line, which was closed during the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in favour of the more direct former Great Western Railway between the cities, from Lawrence Hill in central Bristol to Newbridge in Bath. It passes through the suburbs of Easton, Fishponds, and Staple Hill, then the villages of Mangotsfield, Warmley, Bitton and Saltford, before ending at Newbridge. =Bristol end= The Bristol and Bath cycle path passes under Station Road in Fishponds, Bristol The path starts at Trinity Street, Lawrence Hill. =Clay Bottom= A housing development at Clay Bottom (near the B4469) has encroached onto the alignment of the railway, and the cycleway diverts around several houses causing a blind corner. These houses would be in the way of any future use of this section as a guided busway or rail use. =Staple Hill= 3.2 miles from the Bristol end, the path reaches Staple Hill station. On the remaining platform there is a modern sculptured seat. The path rises up level with the platform, and then drops back down to the track bed. A short distance from the station is the entrance to the 0.3-mile-long Staple Hill Tunnel under Staple Hill. The west end of the tunnel is at , the east end at . The path takes up less than half the width of the tunnel, with the rest of the floor uneven rocks. The tunnel is lit all year-round, and despite the warning signs, 24 hours a day. The roof leaks in places, giving the appearance of rain, often when outside it is dry. =Mangotsfield station= The Bristol & Bath Railway Path, looking towards Bristol from the former Mangotsfield railway station Mangotsfield railway station was on the Midland Railway Bristol and Gloucester main line, the junction for the Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line to Bath Green Park railway station. It had six platforms. The disused Bristol and Gloucester route to Yate now provides a spur from the railway path northwest to the Bristol ring road cycle path and Emersons Green. The remaining island platforms have railway-related sculptures between them, some depicting waiting passengers. One notable sculpture was that of a suitcase, supposedly belonging to one of the passengers. However, it disappeared in the summer of 2008. =Avon ring road= From 1999 to July 2001 South Gloucestershire Council built a new section of the A4174 Avon ring road along part of the path. While the work was being undertaken the path was diverted away from the old railway line and a new section was added around the ring road, increasing the length by 200 yards. The new section includes two bridges, several tight corners, a hill (South Gloucestershire Council describes it as a 'barely perceptible gradient'), and two cattle grids. =Warmley station= The station platform at Warmley contains a cafe, serving refreshments seven days a week year-round, and includes a toilet as well as public toilets.Map - Warmley =Avon Valley Railway= Bitton railway station taken from the path Between Avon Riverside and Oldland Common the path shares its route with the heritage Avon Valley Railway. Along this two-mile shared section the path crosses the railway line at two level crossings. There has been opposition to the Avon Valley Railway expanding their line, demonstrated by the painting of graffiti along the path where it runs parallel with the line. The railway's cafe at Bitton railway station is open all year round. =Bath end= The end of the path is at the Brassmill Lane trading estate in Bath. The west Bath river side path continues to the city centre. Guided busway proposal In January 2008, a plan was revealed by the West of England Partnership to turn sections of the path between Emersons Green and Bristol City Centre into a Guided Busway. Sustrans have announced that they will oppose these plans, claiming that they are the \\"right idea, wrong route\\". A petition against this proposal on Bristol City Council's website gained over 7900 signatures within the first month.Bristol Petitioning A website was set up by a group opposed to the plans.Save the Railway Path  The campaign to save the Bristol to Bath cycle path from being turned into a bus-lane In a council meeting on 1 April, plans for the busway were put on hold, but the council refused to rule out using the path for a busway later. Rapid transit proposal It is suggested that the eastern route of a proposed Bristol rapid transit system could run as a light rail track alongside the Bristol and Bath Railway Path, which would not have to close.https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/city-could-tram-next- bristol-1157315.amp References External links *Bristol & Bath Railway Path official website *Sustrans, 2002.

He is best known as the man who shot John Wesley Hardin in the Acme Saloon in El Paso, Texas, on August 19, 1895. Early life, service with the Confederacy John Henry Selman was born in Madison County, Arkansas. He was the son of Jeremiah Selman. The Selman family moved to Grayson County, Texas, in 1858. After his father's death on December 16, 1861, Selman joined the 22nd Texas Cavalry and served during the Civil War. On August 17, 1865, Selman married Edna Degraffenreid.Note: Degraffenreid was a descendant of the original landgrave of North Carolina, a titled Swiss national in service to the English Crown. The couple had four children. He and his family eventually moved to Fort Griffin in Shackelford County, Texas. Life as a lawman In 1877, Selman became a deputy inspector for hides, working under fellow inspector, ex- Shackleford County sheriff, John M. Larn. Selman and Larn fought against rustlers and vigilante justice in the lawless area of northwest Texas. The two were involved in several shootouts with bandits and outlaws during the period that followed. Then, on June 24, 1878, vigilantes shot Larn to death in an Albany, Texas, jail cell. Larn had been arrested after six hides, which did not belong to him, had been found behind his house. Even though Selman was out of town at the time, he was implicated in the theft, and found himself a wanted man, hunted by these same vigilantes, who were friends with several men who had previously been either arrested or killed by him. Life as an outlaw Selman went into hiding during this time, as he was also facing charges stemming from his desertion from the Confederate Army. Selman went to Mexico. However, the end of the war and the resulting dissolution of the Confederacy rendered any prior charges null, and Selman was free to return to the United States. Selman's wife died in 1879, while giving birth to a stillborn child. The other four children were placed in the custody of his wife's niece. Selman by this time was living in Lincoln County, New Mexico. This was during the Lincoln County War. He organized a band, \\"Selman's Scouts\\" (known locally as \\"The Rustlers\\"). The group was accused of numerous acts of rape and murder in the area. However, no charges were ever filed against him there. Roscoe \\"Rustling Bob\\" Bryant was involved with John Selman's cattle rustling operation. As a member of \\"Selman's Scouts\\", Bryant was killed by his members near Seven Rivers, New Mexico in September, 1878. His body was found near the corpses of Reese Gobly and James Irvin. By 1880, the band had been driven from Lincoln County, and began operating in Jeff Davis County, Texas. Selman was captured shortly thereafter by Texas Ranger Joe McKidrict, and taken to Shackelford County for trial. Escape and return to law enforcement Selman escaped, and fled again to Chihuahua, Mexico, where he hid out until around 1888, when his name was cleared and all charges against him were dropped. While in Mexico, he sent for his children. The two youngest boys joined their father, but the two oldest remained in Brown County, Texas ‚Äî never to see their father again. He then moved to El Paso, Texas, and on August 23, 1893, he married Romula Granadine. He began working as a constable, and spent time gambling. On April 5, 1894, Selman killed a former Texas Ranger named Bass Outlaw. Outlaw had recently been fired, due to his drinking and the threats he had made against a judge. Selman, encountering an inebriated Outlaw, had suggested that Outlaw needed to go home and sleep it off. When Outlaw declined to go home, however, the two instead walked to \\"Tillie Howard's\\", a local brothel favored by Outlaw. Outlaw created a disturbance at Howard's place, resulting in his fatal shooting of Texas Ranger Joe McKidrict. He also drew on Selman, who was shot and wounded twice in the thigh. Selman returned fire and killed Outlaw. Selman was not arrested for the shooting, which was ruled justified. The shooting of John Wesley Hardin El Paso policeman and Selman's son, John Jr., arrested the mistress of gunman John Wesley Hardin, Beulah M'rose (or \\"the widow M'Rose\\"), for \\"brandishing a gun in public.\\" Hardin confronted the younger Selman about it and the two men had a verbal dispute. In accounts supported by members of Selman's family Hardin pistol-whipped 'Young John' Selman, and threatened his life. After hearing of the argument the elder Selman approached Hardin on the afternoon of August 19, 1895. The two exchanged angry words. That night Hardin went to the Acme Saloon and played dice. Shortly before midnight Selman walked into the saloon to confront Hardin. Drawing his gun at the door he walked up behind Hardin. He fired, shooting Hardin in the back of the head - supposedly as Hardin went for his gun - killing him instantly. As Hardin lay on the floor, Selman fired three more shots into him. Selman was arrested, charged with murder and stood trial. Selman testified he saw Hardin notice him enter in the mirror and that Hardin had gone for his gun. Selman swore he fired in self-defense. A hung jury resulted in his release on bond, pending retrial. Final gunfight On the night of April 5, 1896, Selman was killed in a shootout by US Marshal George Scarborough. The two men were playing cards and argued. It has been alleged that the argument was over Selman killing Scarborough's good friend Bass Outlaw on that same date two years earlier. However, this is highly unlikely, as Scarborough and Selman were friendly for many years and Outlaw was generally disliked by the other Rangers - buried with no mourners present. Instead, it is far more likely that Scarborough's testimony when tried for killing Selman was truthful, to wit: John Jr. had fallen in love and eloped with a Mexican girl, whose father, an ambassador, disapproved. When they were found the father had the younger Selman jailed in Juarez. On the night of his death, Selman Sr., who was drinking with Scarborough said he wanted to talk privately. According to Scarborough, they exited to the alley where Selman asked him to help spring Young John from the jail across the border the next morning. They discussed a time to meet and then Selman invited Scarborough back in to have a drink. Scarborough declined whereupon Selman exclaimed \\"You G-- d----- son-of-a-b---- I am going to kill you.\\"El Paso Times El Paso, Texas, April 7, 1896, pg. 3 Selman drew first and Scarborough then shot him in self-defense. Selman died hours later. When it was found that Selman's gun was not at the scene Scarborough was arrested for murder. Just before his trial, a thief, Cole Belmont, was arrested and it was then discovered that he had Selman's gun. The thief said he saw the shooting and stole the gun before the crowd arrived. Scarborough was acquitted and released. Burial Selman was originally buried in an unmarked grave in the Catholic section of El Paso's Concordia Cemetery, although he was not known to be Roman Catholic. News reports of the day clearly state the burial was in the Catholic section. His grave marker, however, was placed in the middle of the Protestant section of the cemetery.Note: The marker is in the protestant section: tier 7, lot 23, grave 11; Concordia's burial records reveal that at this location rest the remains of Virginia Lee Steinborn, a three year old girl who died in a automobile accident in 1933.

After the dissolution of the monasteries, the abbey was largely demolished and a country house was built on the site. In the 20th century the house was modified and it is now the Retreat and Conference House of the Diocese of Blackburn. The ruins of the abbey are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. History =Monastery= In 1296 the Cistercian monks from Stanlow Abbey moved to Whalley. Stanlow Abbey had been founded on the banks of the River Mersey in the 1170s by John fitz Richard, the constable of Chester. This abbey had suffered a series of misfortunes, including flooding in 1279, the destruction of the church tower in a gale in 1287 and a fire in 1289. In 1283 Henry de Lacy, tenth Baron of Halton agreed to the move from Stanlow to Whalley but this was not achieved until 1296. The first stone was laid by Henry de Lacy in June 1296 and at least part of the site was consecrated by the Bishop of Whithern in 1306. Building proceeded slowly and the foundation stone was laid in 1330. Stone for building the abbey was obtained from quarries at Read and Simonstone. A royal licence to build a crenellated wall around the site was obtained in 1339. The church was completed in 1380 but the remainder of the abbey was not finished until the 1440s. In 1480 the North East Gatehouse, which provided a new entrance to the abbey, was completed. In the 16th century, John Paslew, the last Abbot of Whalley, reconstructed his own lodgings and added a Lady Chapel. The abbey closed in 1537 as part of the dissolution of the monasteries. Also that year Abbot Paslew was executed for high treason for his part in events connected with the Pilgrimage of Grace the previous year. =Private house= In 1553 the abbey lands and the manor of Whalley were sold for just over ¬£2,151 to John Braddyll of Brockhall and Richard Assheton of Lever near Bolton. The properties were divided and Assheton took the monastic site and buildings. The abbot's house and the infirmary buildings were demolished and a large house was built on the site. In the 17th century most of the remaining church and monastic buildings were pulled down. The house passed through a succession of owners and further alterations were made to it in the 19th century. Around 1900 the house and grounds were bought by Sir John Travis Cragg. =Modern Religious Centre= In 1923 the house and grounds were purchased by the Anglican Diocese of Manchester when the bishop was William Temple. When the diocese was divided in 1926, the property passed to the new Diocese of Blackburn. In 1930 Canon J. R. Lumb was appointed as the first warden of the centre and it has since become a centre of religious education with residential accommodation for guests. Two of the ground floor rooms have been converted into chapels. In the 1930s the site of the abbey church was excavated and the foundations discovered were exposed and consolidated. Present day =Retreat and conference house= The former private house, which is now a retreat and conference house, was reopened in September 2005 following refurbishment. It contains conference rooms, a dining room and en suite rooms for residents. The north range contains a visitor centre, with a coffee shop, exhibition centre and a bookshop. A spirituality programme is available for resident and non-resident guests. Guided tours of the abbey ruins can be arranged in the summer months. Whalley Abbey Gatehouse =Abbey ruins and grounds= Only the foundations of the church remain. The remains of the former monastic buildings are more extensive. The west range, which was the lay brothers' dormitory, consists of two stories, and is roofed. This is currently used as a Roman Catholic church hall. To the south of the cloister, part of the walls of the former kitchen and refectory remain. The east range is more complete and includes parts of the walls of the former monks' day room, parlour and vestry. =Other related buildings= The North West Gateway is separately listed Grade I. It is built in sandstone rubble, is in two storeys and is roofless. It is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The lodge at the entrance to the abbey grounds is listed Grade II. It dates probably from the late 18th century, and is built in ashlar sandstone with a stone slate roof. Also listed Grade II are a pair of gatepiers at the entrance to the grounds.

Administratively part of the Lesser Polish Voivodeship, it is situated west of Gorlice and south-east of the regional capital Krak√≥w. It was formerly a village, but was granted town status on 1 January 2009.Ordinance of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland (in Polish) Bobowa is also located on a railway line running from Tarn√≥w to the border with Slovakia at Leluch√≥w.  History  St. Sophia Church It is not known when the village of Bobowa appeared on the map of Poland. It probably was a Slavic gord, destroyed in 1240 (see Mongol invasion of Poland). Bobowa received Magdeburg rights town charter in 1339. By 1346, the town already had a parish church, and Bobowa at that time belonged to the Gryfita family (Gryf coat of arms). In the 1460 register Liber beneficiorum by Jan D≈Çugosz, one can find the information of Bobowa‚Äôs stone parish church, as well as two smaller, wooden churches. The town still belonged to the Gryfita family, and according to D≈Çugosz, it had three owners - Miko≈Çaj, Jan and Gietko Gryfita. Furthermore, Bobowa had a court and w√≥jt, who in 1467 was a man named Jan Lempart. In the mid-16th- century Bobowa emerged as a local center of the Protestant Reformation, and some time in the early 17th century, the town was purchased by the Jordan family. In 1740 its owner was Stanis≈Çaw ≈Åƒôtowski. Following the Partitions of Poland, Bobowa in 1772 became part of Austrian province of Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. In 1934, the government of the Second Polish Republic stripped Bobowa of its town charter due to its depopulation. Bobowa regained its town status on January 1, 2009.  Jews in Bobowa  The Jews were brought to Bobowa by Micha≈Ç Jaworski in 1732 in order to improve the town's collapsing economy. A synagogue was erected in 1756 serving the needs of 44 families. In 1900 the Jewish population of Bobowa numbered 749. Before the Holocaust in Poland, the town was home to a yeshiva, notable as a historic centre of Hasidism, created and led by the tsadik of the Bobov dynasty. It was also the home of Gen. Boles≈Çaw Wieniawa-D≈Çugoszowski who became \\"President of Poland for a day\\" in 1939. During the Second World War Bobowa became a \\"concentration village\\" where the Jews from the surrounding area were imprisoned. The General's brother Kazimierz was the mayor and was able to save at least one Jew. Almost all were finally killed. One of the few survivors, Professor Samuel P. Oliner of Humboldt State University, California, describes these events in his autobiography Restless Memories. He devoted his academic career to the study of altruism, having himself been rescued by a Polish peasant woman called Balwina. Bobowa synagogue After the war Grand Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (1907 ‚Äì August 2, 2000) re-established the Bobov Hasidic dynasty in America. He was the son of Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam (1874‚Äì1941) of Bobowa, who died in the Holocaust. Initially based in the neighbourhood of Borough Park, Brooklyn, New York, it now has branches in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn; Monsey, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Antwerp; London and Israel and is under the leadership of Rabbi Shlomo's son Rabbi Ben-Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam.  Tourist attractions  Among the tourist attractions of Bobowa is the All Saints Church (14th century) and the St. Sophia Church at the local cemetery, built in the late 15th century and surrounded by a picturesque wall built in the 17th century. In addition, there is a 17th- century szlachta manor house (commonly referred to as the castle by the locals). This was Boles≈Çaw Wieniawa-D≈Çugoszowski's house. In the 17th century this house belonged to early Polish followers of Unitarianism. They cremated their dead; the massive walls of the house contain cremation urns buried within them. There are also remnants of fortifications from the same period. The village's Jewish heritage is represented by a 1778 synagogue and a Jewish cemetery. Bobowa is also one of two (besides Koniak√≥w) villages in Poland famous for traditional art of lace-making. Since 2000 it houses an annual Bobbin lace Festival.

A religious affairs specialist, previously known as chaplain assistant, is a member of the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. This soldier provides expertise in religious support and religious support operations. The Religious Affairs Specialists, which is military occupational specialty (MOS) 56M, support the unit Chaplain and Commander in responding to the needs of soldiers, family members, and other authorized personnel. They act as counselors for their fellow Soldiers and provide security to Army chaplains. Duties include preparing spaces for worship, managing supplies, and ensuring the security and safety of the chaplain during combat situations. The religious affairs specialist is an enlisted soldier or non-commissioned that is part of a \\"task/organized, mission/based team designed to accomplish and support the specified religious, spiritual and ethical needs of soldiers in accordance with command responsibilities\\". Religious affairs specialists are part of unit ministry teams, which consist of one Army chaplain and religious affairs specialist or a religious affairs non-commissioned officer.  History  Branch insignia for the US Army Chaplain Corps The official military occupation specialty (MOS) of chaplain assistant was established by General Orders No. 253, War Department, Washington, D.C., on 28 December 1909. One enlisted man would then be detailed and placed on special duty, by the commanding officer of any organization to which a chaplain is assigned for duty, to assist the chaplain in the performance of his official duties. Although \\"high moral character was required, no prerequisites or recognized criteria for performance\\" In 1927 and 1933, the Chaplain Corps made suggestions to the Secretary of War to provide a small corps of specialized enlisted soldiers through the efforts proved to be unsuccessful.. The job continued to have no vocational integrity until after World War II. The Korean War saw the development of the MOS 7lB.

The plot, which adapts Lindsay's characters and narrative and features themes drawn from Gnosticism, concerns Thomas Perscors, who is transported from Earth to the planet Lucifer by Seth Valentinus. The book received negative responses, and was compared, including by Bloom himself, to Star Wars (1977). Bloom eventually repudiated the work. Plot summary Thomas Perscors (\\"through fire\\"), an incarnation of Primal Man, is taken from Earth to the planet Lucifer by Seth Valentinus, a reincarnation of the gnostic theologian Valentinus. Their guide is Olam, who is an Aeon, an emanation of the true god. Lucifer is controlled by \\"Saklas\\", which is a Gnostic name for the false creator. Olam has brought Perscors to Lucifer to fight Saklas, and has brought Valentinus so he can remember his true self. Perscors cripples Saklas and changes the order of things across all of Lucifer. Publication history The Flight to Lucifer was first published in the United States and Canada by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1979. Reception The Flight to Lucifer received a positive review from Frank McConnell in The New Republic, mixed reviews from Martin Bickman in Library Journal and the critic John Leonard in The New York Times, and negative reviews from Marilyn Butler in the London Review of Books and from Kirkus Reviews. The book was also discussed by the journalist David Kipen in The Atlantic. McConnell described the novel as \\"rich and brilliant\\", and wrote that it dealt, in fictional form, with the themes of Bloom's non-fiction literary criticism. He considered it \\"difficult reading\\", and different in character from the work of fantasy writers such as C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, in that it avoided \\"the comforting details of everyday reality\\". He credited Bloom with coming close to recreating \\"the original Gnostic sensibility\\". Bickman wrote that, \\"Despite the often dazzling imagery and the fast narrative pace, a reader without a detailed knowledge of Gnosticism is likely to be disappointed, if not dismayed\\", but concluded that the novel belongs, \\"in large public and academic collections as another facet of one of our most important and controversial literary theorists.\\" Leonard compared the novel to the science fiction writer Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (1976) and to Star Wars (1977), and questioned the accuracy of Bloom's treatment of Gnosticism. Butler compared the novel to Lewis's Perelandra (1943), and suggested that it showed that Bloom was \\"author of a single complex personal myth\\", writing that he had used fantasy as \\"a vehicle for an alternative interpretation of reality\\". However, while she believed that its discussion of religion would appeal to some readers, the novel had \\"practically nothing to recommend it\\" as fiction. She criticized its plot as lacking \\"suspense, pace and variety.\\" Kirkus Reviews described the novel as tedious and, \\"A close-to- unreadable exercise, only for those who share Bloom's gnostic preoccupations-- or collectors of literary oddities.\\" Kipen dismissed the novel as unsuccessful. Bloom described The Flight to Lucifer as his \\"first attempt at literary fantasy\\". He explained that the novel was inspired by David Lindsay's A Voyage to Arcturus (1920), with his characters \\"Thomas Perscors\\" and \\"Saklas\\" being the equivalents, respectively, of Lindsay's original characters \\"Maskull\\" and \\"Crystalman\\". He identified Edmund Spenser and Franz Kafka as additional influences on his novel. He gave his relationship to A Voyage to Arcturus, which according to his own account he had \\"obsessively\\" read hundreds of times, as an example of his theory of the anxiety of influence. He considered it superior to his novel, partly because he attempted deliberately to assimilate Lindsay's characters and narrative to second-century Gnosticism rather than being a \\"naive Gnostic\\" like Lindsay, who according to Bloom inadvertently created a personal Gnostic heresy. He wrote that despite its \\"violent narrative\\", his novel \\"has too much trouble getting off the ground\\" and \\"reads as though Walter Pater was writing Star Wars.\\" He nevertheless saw The Flight to Lucifer as having some merit, and wrote that it \\"does get better as it goes along\\" and \\"towards its close can be called something of a truly weird work\\". Bloom stated in a 2015 interview with Daniel D'Addario in Time that after re-reading The Flight to Lucifer, he decided that the novel would \\"never do\\", and that, \\"I had to pay the publisher not to have a second printing of the paperback. If I could go around and get rid of all the surviving copies, I would.\\" References Sources =Books= * * =Journals=   * Category:1979 American novels Category:Books by Harold Bloom Category:Fantasy novels Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:Gnosticism Category:Novels about religion Category:Sequel novels ","title":"The Flight to Lucifer"},{"id":"6633307","text":"Stanlow Abbey (or Stanlaw Abbey) was a Cistercian abbey situated on Stanlow Point, on the banks of the River Mersey in the Wirral Peninsula, Cheshire, England (). The abbey was founded in 1178 by John fitz Richard as a daughter abbey of Combermere Abbey. Roger de Lacy, John de Lacy and Edmund de Lacy, respectively the 7th, 8th and 9th Barons of Halton, were buried at Stanlow. The abbey was in an exposed situation near the Mersey estuary and it suffered from a series of disasters. In 1279 it was flooded by water from the Mersey and in 1287 during a fierce storm, its tower collapsed and part of the abbey was destroyed by fire. The monks appealed to the pope for the monastery to be moved to a better site and, with the pope's consent and the agreement of Edward I and Henry de Lacy, the 10th Baron, they moved to Whalley Abbey near Clitheroe, Lancashire. This move took place in 1296. However a small cell of monks remained on the site until the Reformation, the site becoming a grange of Whalley Abbey. The remains of the abbey lie between the Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal. The standing remains include two sandstone walls and a re-used doorway, and the buried features include part of a drain leading to the River Gowy.

It is beside Belfast City Airport, in the townland of Knocknagoney. The site was previously known as D5 and Harbour Exchange. At present, the development compromises an 11 unit 13,940 m2 (150,000 ft2) retail warehouse centre with (as of December 2014); Harvey Norman, Next Home, Decathlon, and Wrights Sofaland.\\"Wrights Sofaland\\" Located beside the retail warehouse is a Sainsbury's store and service station, a B&Q; store, and an IKEA store. Like the expansion of the Sprucefield development, Holywood Exchange has been controversial and the subject of repeated planning problems and legal disputes. History The first planning application for what was then known as D5 was made by Aquis Estates Limited, Anglia and General Developments Limited and Belfast Harbour Commissioners on 14 November 1995. A five week public inquiry was held in December 1996 and January 1997.Morton, Robert (2 January 1997) 'Harbour site war' Belfast Telegraph In 1997, the Planning Appeal Commission and the Department of the Environment's Planning Service recommended that approval should be granted. Formal planning permission was granted on 13 April 1999. On 21 June 1999, Belfast City Council and The Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce applied for judicial review of the decision to grant planning permission. On 9 July 1999, planning permission for D5 was quashed, as it was judged that the Minister did not take the decision with all the relevant information. Planning permission for the competing Tesco development on the opposite side of the A2 road had been granted on 28 November 1998. Following the quashing of planning permission for D5 its developers sought judicial review of the permission granted to Tesco, arguing that the same could apply to that development, however, this was refused on 17 September 1999. This judgement was slightly controversial, given that the judge refused to rescind planning permission solely because the ¬£13 million Tesco store was almost complete. The developers resubmitted their planning application and were granted permission on 21 March 2000. This decision was again successfully challenged in September 2000. Following another appeal, planning permission was granted in February 2001. The Belfast Chamber of Trade lodged a legal challenge with the House of Lords, however its judicial committee refused to grant the chamber of trade leave to appeal. Construction of the B&Q; store commenced in December 2002. B&Q; Holywood Exchange opened in August 2003. Sainsbury's Holywood Exchange opened in September 2003 with a sales area of 3,809 m2 (41,000 ft2) The retail warehouse units were not let after completion; they are \\"the subject of strict guidelines that dictate that only bulky goods can be sold\\" as a result of the legal challenges to its construction. However, in May 2008 The Irish News reported that The Planning Service \\"is considering an application that would see the addition of a mezzanine floor in the retail warehouse. Retailers say the additional space is necessary for them to display goods.\\" The Irish News named Harvey Norman, Next, T.K.

Retrieved on 16 August 2008 =IKEA= In January 2006, IKEA announced its intention to build a 25,800 m2 (278,000 ft2) store, its first in Northern Ireland. In May 2006, IKEA amended its application for a larger 29,000 m2 (312,000 ft2) store. The application was approved in December 2006, work on the store began in January 2007, and the store opened on 13 December 2007. The store includes a five hundred seat Restaurant, Bistro and Swedish Shop and has parking for 1455 vehicles. Heating is provided by a 1.2 MW biomass boiler fuelled by locally produced woodchips. =Restaurant Units= In June 2012, it was announced that four restaurant units 924.11 m2 (9934 ft2) were to be built within the existing retail units park and would be soon available to lease. As of January 2015, Subway and Costa Coffee have occupied two separate premises. Transport The developers of the Holywood Exchange were able to take advantage of existing road connections. The most important element of these connections was a full flyover on the A2, already built for access to the Belfast Harbour Estate. The Belfast-Bangor railway line runs between the site and the A2. There are proposals for a railway halt to serve both Holywood Exchange and the adjacent Belfast City Airport. However, Belfast City Airport argues that constructing the halt adjacent to the airport terminal (further away from Holywood Exchange) would encourage more air travellers to use the rail connection. The Airport has also stated that it will consider providing road access to the airport through Holywood Exchange as a way of reducing congestion on the existing airport access route. On 16 January 2007 the Regional Development Minister David Cairns announced that a feasibility study would be launched into the construction of a rapid transit route linking Holywood Exchange to Belfast city centre. The route would also serve the airport and the Titanic Quarter development.

The first castle, erected in the 13th century, was destroyed and replaced several times until the 18th century when a large mansion house was built in its place. This too was demolished in 1938, and today only a single corner tower of the 17th-century castle remains. The castle was the former family seat of the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The castle was located around north-east of the village of Douglas, South Lanarkshire, in south-west Scotland. The remains are protected as a category C listed building. History The Douglas family built the first Douglas Castle, which was constructed of either wood or stone, sometime before 1288.Salter (1993) states that the castle was \\"mentioned in 1288\\", but no source is given. In 1307, during the Wars of Scottish Independence the castle was captured and garrisoned by the English under Lord Clifford. Sir James Douglas, companion of Robert the Bruce successfully recaptured his family seat by storming the castle on Palm Sunday, while the garrison were at chapel. He had the garrison killed and thrown into a cellar, before the structure was burned. The event has become known as \\"Douglas' larder\\". The remains of the 17th-century castle, seen from the south-west Robert the Bruce rewarded the loyalty of the Douglases, and Sir James' heirs were created Earls of Douglas. Douglas Castle was rebuilt as one of their strongholds, but by the 15th century, the power of the \\"Black\\" Douglases had come to threaten the Stewart monarchy. In 1455 James II led an expedition against the rebellious 9th Earl, defeating his forces at the battle of Arkinholm. Douglas Castle was sacked and the family's lands and titles forfeited. The \\"Red\\" Douglases, Earls of Angus, had sided with the king against the senior branch of their family, and it was they who gained the Douglas lands in Lanarkshire. It is likely that the castle was rebuilt soon after 1455. Regent Morton came to Douglasdale in June 1574 to survey the house of the Earl of Angus with a view to repairing it and living there.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.4 (1905), p.680. In 1703, Archibald Douglas, 3rd Marquess of Douglas was created Duke of Douglas, with his principal seat at Douglas Castle. The castle was again rebuilt around this time, as a tower house and an enclosed courtyard with a corner tower. This castle was destroyed by fire in 1755, with the exception of the corner tower.The Listed Building Report for the structure gives the date of the fire as 1758. From 1757, the Duke began construction of an enormous castellated mansion at Douglas. The architects of this, the final Douglas Castle, were the Adam Brothers (James Adam, John Adam, and Robert Adam). Had it been completed the castle would have been the largest in Scotland. As it was the Duke of Douglas died in 1761, and only around half of the original design was ever completed. The five storey building had round towers to the front and square towers to the rear facade, and stood in a very extensive park spanning the valley of the Douglas Water. The Duke's estate became the subject of a famous and bitter legal dispute, known as the \\"Douglas Cause\\", between his nephew Archibald James Edward Douglas and the Duke of Hamilton. Douglas was eventually victorious and ennobled as Baron Douglas in 1790, and the castle descended through his daughter, and granddaughter, to the Earls of Home. In the 1930s Charles Douglas-Home, 13th Earl of Home allowed the mining of coal in the park adjacent to the castle, in an attempt to relieve desperate levels of local unemployment. Sadly, the mining caused dangerous subsidence to the castle and it had to be demolished in 1938. The castle today Today, only a ruined corner tower of the penultimate castle remains, built in the late 17th century. Three storeys and 9m in height, the tower once stood at the corner of an enclosure, estimated at around 40m across. The tower stands on a prominent rise in the valley, to the south of the river, and was retained as a garden folly when the later mansion was built. Below is a small cellar block with glazed tiles on the interior walls. Nothing visible remains of the mansion. Sir Walter Scott used the location and early history of Castle Douglas as the inspiration for his novel Castle Dangerous. The castle is still sometimes referred to by this alternative name.

It was enacted on 15 June 1945 when the caretaker Conservative government was in office under Winston Churchill, but it did not come into effect until 6 August 1946 when the Labour government under Clement Attlee was in power. Family allowances had been one of the items proposed by the Beveridge Report in 1942. The Labour Party briefly debated pressing for allowances during the Second World War, but a party conference resolution to this end was opposed by the trades unions for fear that the amount paid would be taken into account in wage negotiations, leaving workers no better off. As passed, the Act empowered the Minister of National Insurance to pay an allowance of five shillings per week for each child in a family other than the eldest; later Acts increased this sum. It was payable whilst the child was of school age, up to the age of eighteen, if apprenticed or in full-time school education.

History  Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug was established on 26 February 1925, under the name of the Komi-Permyak National Okrug as a part of the former Ural Oblast. On 17 January 1934, the oblast was abolished and split into a number of regions, one of which was Sverdlovsk Oblast, which Komi-Permyak NO was subordinated to. On 3 October 1938, Perm Oblast was created and Komi-Permyak NO became subordinated to it. The region name was changed to end with \\"Autonomous Okrug\\" rather than \\"National Okrug\\" in 1977. In 1992, the region became its own federal entity within the Russian Federation while simultaneously being administratively subordinated to Perm Oblast. In 2003, a merger referendum was held. The majority of residents who participated in the referendum in both Perm Oblast and Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug voted to merge the two regions into a single federal entity. On 1 December 2005, Komi- Permyak Autonomous Okrug was merged into Perm Oblast to form the new region of Perm Krai.

Summary The BG&CM; operated a line between Spalding and Cottonwood, along the former Second Subdivision of the Camas Prairie Railroad. Spalding is located about east of Lewiston, which is at Idaho's western border with Washington. BGCM connects with Great Northwest Railroad at Spalding. BGCM also operates the portion of the former Camas Prairie Railroad which runs from Spalding to Orofino, then to Kooskia along the river grade of the Clearwater River. BGCM's route consists of the former Camas Prairie Railroad's Second Subdivision line, which was in length from Spalding to Grangeville. As of 2005, only the between Spalding and Cottonwood were operated; the last of track between Cottonwood and Grangeville were removed in late 2002 and 2003. When BG&CM; stepped in to operate the second subdivision line in December 2002, it was originally planning to operate the from Spalding to Craigmont, but a few weeks later decided to continue south, across Lawyer's Canyon to Cottonwood, stopping the salvage crews from going further north. In 2005, Watco Companies, owner of the BGCM's Spalding connection Great Northwest Railroad (GRNW), leased to BGCM the entire GRNW route east of Lewiston of mainline track, including the railroad from Orofino to Konkolville. The BGCM route had been acquired from Camas Prairie RailNet (CSPR) in December 2002, a subsidiary of North American RailNet, which had acquired the entire Camas Prairie line in April 1998 from the line's previous (and original) co-owners, Union Pacific Railroad and Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. CSPR received permission from the Surface Transportation Board to abandon the Grangeville Branch in September 2000 and made its last run on that line in late November. Watco had acquired the remainder of the Camas Prairie RailNet in March 2004. As of April, 2013, the second sub is used for storage of empty flatcars between Lapwai and Culdesac.

The two railroads were competitors throughout the Pacific Northwest, battling to capture railroad traffic in timber, minerals, and agricultural products. Camas Prairie Railroad was sold by co- owners UP and BNSF to North American RailNet of Bedford, Texas in April 1998 and it became Camas Prairie RailNet, Inc. After six years it was sold to Watco and became Great Northwest Railroad in March 2004. There were about of track in the transaction: from Riparia, Washington, east to Lewiston; from Lewiston east to Kooskia; and from Orofino northeast to near Jaype. The Orofino to Jaype segment was out of service. BGCM is owned by Midwest Pacific Rail Net & Logistics of Kansas City, Missouri. MPRL also owns: * Boot Hill and Western Railway (Out of Service) * Dakota Southern Railway * Fremont Northern Railway * Iowa River Railroad * Nevada Northern Railway * McCloud River Railroad (Out of Service) * Ozark Valley Railroad * St. Maries River Railroad * Washington and Idaho Railway In 2009, BGCM's owner attempted to purchase a portion of the Arizona and California Railroad, running between Rice, California and Ripley, California through Blythe, California from RailAmerica then-recently granted for abandonment, but failed to succeed an offer of financial assistance process.

Directed by Ghislaine Thesmar and Pierre Lacotte, the company rehearsed in the Diaghilev studio, performing on the stage of the Salle Garnier at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo and immediately started touring. Their repertoire includes works from the Ballets Russes and contemporary pieces from guest choreographers such as Kevin Haigen, John Clifford, Jean- Christophe Maillot, Dieter Amman, and Uwe Scholz. In 1989, Jean Yves Esquerre became artistic director, after the departure of Ghislaine Thesmar and Pierre Lacotte one year earlier. In 1992, Jean-Christophe Maillot joined the company, first as artistic consultant, and was officially promoted to the rank of director-choreographer in September 1993. Four years later, thanks to his vision and energy, the Ballets de Monte-Carlo left the building that had been their historical home, which had by then become too small, and moved into their own dance center, l‚ÄôAtelier. Furthermore, in December 2000, they inaugurated their first ballet season on the huge stage of the Salle des Princes at the brand new congress center in Monaco, the Grimaldi Forum.

The idea of using reflected GNSS signal for earth observation became more and more popular in the mid-1990s at NASA Langley research centre and is also known as GPS reflectometry. Research applications of GNSS-R are found in * Altimetry * Oceanography (Wave Height and Wind Speed) * Cryosphere monitoring * Soil moisture monitoring GNSS reflectometry is passive sensing that takes advantage of and relies on separate active sources - the satellites generating the navigation signals. For this, the GNSS receiver measures the signal delay from the satellite (the pseudorange measurement) and the rate of change of the range between satellite and observer (the Doppler measurement). The surface area of the reflected GNSS signal also provides the two parameters time delay and frequency change. As a result, the Delay Doppler Map (DDM) can be obtained as GNSS-R observable. The shape and power distribution of the signal within the DDM is dictated by two reflecting surface conditions: its dielectric properties and its roughness state. Further derivation of geophysical information rely on these measurements. GNSS-Reflectometry works as a bi-static radar, where transmitter and receiver and separated by a significant distance. Since in GNSS- Reflectometry one receiver simultaneously can track multiple transmitters (i.e. GNSS satellites), the system also has nature of multi-static radar. The receiver of the reflected GNSS signal can be of different kind: Stationary stations, ship measurements, air planes or satellites, like the UK-DMC satellite, part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. It carried a secondary reflectometry payload that has demonstrated the feasibility of receiving and measuring GPS signals reflected from the surface of the Earth's oceans from its track in low Earth orbit to determine wave motion and windspeed.M.

Gestures are a form of nonverbal communication in which visible bodily actions are used to communicate important messages, either in place of speech or together and in parallel with spoken words. Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. Physical non-verbal communication such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention differ from gestures, which communicate specific messages. Gestures are culture-specific and may convey very different meanings in different social or cultural settings. Gesture is distinct from sign language. Although some gestures, such as the ubiquitous act of pointing, differ little from one place to another, most gestures do not have invariable or universal meanings, but connote specific meanings in particular cultures. A single emblematic gesture may have very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive. This list includes links to pages that discuss particular gestures, as well as short descriptions of some gestures that do not have their own page. Not included are the specialized gestures, calls, and signals used by referees and umpires in various organized sports. Policemen also make gestures when directing traffic. Miming is an art form in which the performer uses gestures to convey a story; charades is a game of gestures. __TOC__ Single handed Okay sign Peace sign * A-ok or Okay, made by connecting the thumb and forefinger in a circle and holding the other fingers straight, usually signal the word okay. It is considered obscene in Brazil and Turkey, being similar to the Western extended middle finger with the back of the hand towards the recipient; similarly, the hand shape in American Sign Language when made with the other three fingers slightly separated with particular movement and palm orientation can turn into an obscene sign. It is also an insult in parts of Europe, meaning anal sex, to imply the rudeness or arrogance of the recipient, often used when driving (though thumb and index finger separated to infer \\"small male member\\"). In Japanese culture a way of requesting money or payment uses a similar hand sign, with the palm facing upwards and the three extended fingers level. * Abhayamudra is a Hindu mudra or gesture of reassurance and safety. * Apology hand gesture is a Hindu custom to apologize in the form of a hand gesture with the right hand when a person's foot accidentally touches a book or any written material (which are considered as a manifestation of the goddess of knowledge Saraswati), money (which is considered as a manifestation of the goddess of wealth Lakshmi) or another person's leg. The offending person first touches the object with the fingertips and then the forehead and/or chest. * Beckoning sign. In North America or Northern Europe a beckoning sign is made with the index finger sticking out of the clenched fist, palm facing the gesturer. The finger moves repeatedly towards the gesturer (in a hook) as to draw something nearer. It has the general meaning of \\"come here\\". It can also be done with the palm upwards so the finger points directly at the target. In Northern Africa (i.e. the Maghreb), calling someone is done using the full hand. In several Asian and European countries, a beckoning sign is made with a scratching motion with all four fingers and with the palm down. In Japan and other countries in the far-east cultural area, the palm faces the recipient with the hand at head's height. If reversed, it's considered rude. Before \\"bunny ears\\", people were given cuckold's horns as an insult by sneaking up behind them with two fingers (c. 1815 French satire). * Bellamy salute was used in conjunction with the American Pledge of Allegiance prior to World War II. * Bent index finger. This is a gesture that means 'dead' in Chinese culture. * Biker wave used by motorcyclists. * Hand of benediction and blessing. The benediction gesture (or benedictio Latina gesture) is a raised right hand with the ring finger and little finger touching the palm, while the middle and index fingers remain raised. Taken from Ancient Roman iconography for speaking (an example is the Augustus of Prima Porta where the emperor Augustus assumes the pose of an orator in addressing his troops), often called the benediction gesture, is used by the Christian clergy to perform blessings with the sign of the cross; however Christians keep the thumb raised ‚Äî the three raised fingers (index, middle, and thumb) are frequently allegorically interpreted as representing the three Persons of the Holy Trinity. The hand's shape is said to partially spell the name of Jesus Christ in Greek. A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities: Being a Continuation of the Dictionary of the Bible, Volume 1 William George Smith and Samuel Cheetham, London, John Murray, 1878. * Blah- blah. The fingers are kept straight and together, held horizontal or upwards and bending at the lowest knuckles, while the thumb points downwards. The fingers and thumb then snap together repeatedly to suggest a mouth talking. The gesture can be used to indicate that someone talks too much, gossips, is saying nothing of any consequence, or is boring. * Check, please. This gesture, used to mean that a dinner patron wishes to pay the bill and depart, is executed by touching the index finger and thumb together and \\"writing\\" a checkmark, circle, or wavy line (as if signing one's name) in the air. :To signal for the bill in Japan, although not widely used by younger people, both hands are raised, with the two index fingers forming an \\"X\\". This is to signal the 'end' of a meal which is called \\"Shime ()\\" in Japanese. The crossed fingers represent this sign resembling an \\"X\\". A clenched fist *Chinese number gestures are a method of using one hand to signify the natural numbers one through ten. *Clenched fist is used as a gesture of defiance or solidarity. Facing the signer, it threatens physical violence (i.e., \\"a thumping\\"). Kennedy's gesture seen here with Nikita Khrushchev. * Clinton thumb. The gesture dubbed the \\"Clinton thumb\\" after one of its most famous users, Bill Clinton, is used by politicians to provide emphasis in speeches. This gesture has the thumb leaning against the thumb-side portion of the index finger, which is part of a closed fist, or slightly projecting from the fist. An emphatic, it does not exhibit the anger of the clenched fist or pointing finger, and so is thought to be less threatening. This gesture was likely adopted by Clinton from John F. Kennedy, who can be seen using it in many speeches and images from his political career. * Crossed fingers are used superstitiously to wish for good luck or to nullify a promise. * Cuckoo sign, touched or screw loose. In North America, making a circling motion of the index finger at the ear or temple signifies that the person \\"has a screw loose\\", i.e. is speaking nonsense or is crazy. * Cuckold's horns are traditionally placed behind an unwitting man (the cuckold) to insult him and represent that his wife is unfaithful. It is made with the index and middle fingers spread by a person standing behind the one being insulted. In modern culture as bunny ears \\"the actual symbolism has been forgotten and only the offence remains.\\"The Cuckold's Horns, Beach Combing, May 16, 2014. * Dap greeting is a fist-to-fist handshake popularized in Western cultures since the 1970s, related to the fist bump. * Eyelid pull, where one forefinger is used to pull the lower eyelid further down, and signifies alertness. The \\"fig sign\\" is an ancient gesture with many uses. The ILY sign, \\"I Love You\\" Pollice Verso by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. a man pointing at a photo * Fig sign is a gesture made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers, or, rarely, the middle and ring fingers, forming the fist so that the thumb partly pokes out. In some areas of the world, the gesture is considered a good luck charm; in others (including Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Russia, Serbia and Turkey among others), it is considered an obscene gesture. The precise origin of the gesture is unknown, but many historians speculate that it refers to a penis penetrating the female genitalia (to which The Finger also refers). In ancient Greece, this gesture was a fertility and good luck charm designed to ward off evil. This usage has survived in Portugal and Brazil, where carved images of hands in this gesture are used in good luck talismans. * The Finger, an extended middle finger with the back of the hand towards the recipient, is an obscene hand gesture used in much of Western culture. * Finger gun is a hand gesture in which the subject uses their hand to mimic a handgun. If pointed to oneself (with or without the \\"hammer falling\\" of the thumb indicating firing), it may indicate boredom or awkwardness in the sense of wanting to commit (social) suicide; when pointed to another, it is interpreted as a threat of violence, either genuine or in jest. Between friends, a finger gun can be a sign of acknowledgement similar to a head nod and hello. *Finger heart is a hand gesture in which the subject has a palm up fist, raises their index finger and brings their thumb over it so as to form a small heart shape. It signals a similar gesture to that of the two-handed heart. It originates from South Korean culture and was used by athletes during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Games. * Fist bump is similar to a handshake or high five which may be used as a symbol of respect. * Fist pump is a celebratory gesture in which a closed fist is raised before the torso and subsequently drawn down in a vigorous, swift motion. * Grey Wolf salute is a fist with the little finger and index finger raised, depicting head of a wolf. Originally used by the Gagauz as a gesture of salutation and victory, the gesture was later adopted by the Grey Wolves and is associated with Turkish nationalism. * Hand Plateau is the extending of an open hand with an upturned palm to indicate an item or person. When swept horizontally it can signify an entire area. It is considered more polite than a pointed finger. * Handshake is a greeting ritual in which two people grasp each other's hands and may move their grasped hands up and down. * High five is a celebratory ritual in which two people simultaneously raise one hand and then slap these hands together. * Hitchhiking gestures including sticking one thumb upward, especially in North America, or pointing an index finger toward the road elsewhere to request a ride in an automobile. * Horn sign is a hand gesture made by extending the index and little finger straight upward. It has a vulgar meaning in some Mediterranean Basin countries like Italy and is used in rock and roll, especially in heavy metal music called \\"devil's horns\\", often used with the tongue extended downward. * ILY sign combines the letters 'I', 'L', and 'Y' from American Sign Language by extending the thumb, index finger, and little finger while the middle and ring finger touch the palm. It is an informal expression of love. * Knocking on wood is a superstitious gesture used to ensure that a good thing will continue to occur after it has been acknowledged. However, it is sometimes used after speaking of a plausible unfortunate event, so that it does not actually occur. * Kod√°ly hand signs are a series of visual aids used during singing lessons in the Kod√°ly method. * Loser, made by extending the thumb and forefinger to resemble the shape of an L on the forehead is an insulting gesture. * Mano pantea, which is a traditional way to ward off the evil eye, is made by raising the right hand with the palm out and folding the pinky and ring finger. An amulet was found in Pompeii.The Evil Eye, Frederick Thomas Elworthy, 1895. *The money gesture, more commonly known as the \\"Pay Me\\" gesture, is signalled by repeatedly rubbing one's thumb over the tip of the index finger and middle finger. This gesture resembles the act of rubbing coins or bills together and is generally used when speaking about money. * Moutza is a traditional insult gesture in Greece made by extending all five fingers and presenting the palm or palms toward the person being insulted. * Nazi salute or Fascist salute was used in Germany and Italy during World War II to indicate loyalty to Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini and their respective parties. The right arm is raised in a straight diagonal position forward with the palm open facing downward. It was also used during Spanish State to indicate loyalty to Francisco Franco and in Greece for Ioannis Metaxas. * Outstretched hand (with palm up) is a near- universal gesture for begging or requesting, extending beyond human cultures and into other primate species. This gesture can also be done with both hands to form a bowl. See also Origin of language. * Pointing with index finger may be used to indicate an item or person.

Retrieved 13 December 2015. Archived at the Internet Archive from the original \\"But for ISIS, the symbol is more sinister than a mere declaration of monotheistic beliefs. As Salafi jihadists, members of the group adhere to a fundamentalist interpretation of tawhid that rejects non-fundamentalist regimes as idolatrous. In other words, the concept of tawhid is central to ISIS‚Äô violent and uncompromising posture toward its opponents, both in the Middle East and in the West.\\" The gesture is identical to a common gesture for the number four. * Raised fist is mostly used by activists to express solidarity and defiance against oppression. * The Ring is an Italian gesture used in conversation to delineate precise information, or emphasize a specific point. It is made similarly to the A-Ok sign, but the ring made by the thumb and forefinger is on top with the palm facing medially. The arm moves up and down at the elbow. If more emphasis is needed both hands will make the gesture simultaneously with the palms facing one another. * Roman salute is a salute made by a small group of people holding their arms outward with fingertips touching.

Thumb up * Tiny finger gesture is made with all fingers enclosed in the hand except the thumb and index fingers which are straight. Those two are put close to each other without touching. This is used to indicate a small amount of something or used when speaking indicate one is making a fine distinction when speaking. In the latter case, this is often accompanied by rotating the wrist back and forth slightly. According to Rowan, raising the pinky finger while the fist is closed and gesturing at someone who is Chinese is considered disrespectful. It is similar to gesturing with the middle finger. * Two-finger salute is a salute made using the middle and index fingers. It is used by Polish Armed Forces and by Cub Scouts. * V sign or Victory hand is made by raising the index and middle fingers and separating them to form a V, usually with the palm facing outwards. This sign began to be used during World War II to indicate \\"V for Victory\\". In the 1960s, the hippie-movement began to use the V-sign to mean \\"peace\\", especially in the United States. It is also used in most coastal east Asian nations, in either orientation, as an indication of cuteness when being photographed. Examples are China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.  V sign as an insult is made by raising the index finger and middle finger separated to form a V with the back of the hand facing outwards.

It is made with all fingers of the left hand pointing downward. * Vulcan salute was used in the television program Star Trek. It consists of all fingers raised and parted between the ring and middle fingers with the thumb sticking out to the side. It was devised and popularized by Leonard Nimoy, who portrayed the half-Vulcan character Mr. Spock, and who wrote in his memoir I Am Not Spock that he had based it on the Priestly Blessing performed by Jewish Kohanim with both hands, thumb to thumb in this same position, representing the Hebrew letter Shin (◊©). * Wanker gesture is made by curling the fingers into a loose fist and moving the hand up and down as though masturbating.

This is supposed to represent the face of an Anteater the mascot of UC Irvine. Two handed A√±jali MudrƒÅ or Namaste gesture. * Air quotes are made by raising both hands to eye level and flexing the index and middle fingers of both hands while speaking. Their meaning is similar to that of scare quotes in writing. * A√±jali MudrƒÅ (namaste) is a sign of respect in India and among yoga practitioners. It is made by pressing the palms together. This is of Indian origin. * Applause is an expression of approval made by clapping the hands together to create repetitive staccato noise. Applause is most appropriate within a group setting, to collectively show approval by the volume, duration, and clamor of the noise. * Awkward turtle is a two handed gesture used to mark a moment as awkward. One hand is placed flat atop the other with both palms facing down, fingers extended outward from the hand and thumbs stuck out to the sides. The thumbs are rotated to symbolize flippers. * Batsu. In Japanese culture, the batsu (literally: √ó-mark) is a gesture made by crossing one's arms in the shape of an \\"X\\" in front of them in order to indicate that something is \\"wrong\\" or \\"no good\\". * Bras d'honneur is an obscene gesture made by flexing one elbow while gripping the inside of the bent arm with the opposite hand. * The Kohanic or Priestly Blessing - a gesture of benediction in Judaism, used (especially by those of Kohanic or priestly descent) when reciting the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6: 22-26). Both hands are held up, palms toward the congregation, with the fingers grouped in twos - the little and ring fingers together, the index and second fingers together, and the tips of the two thumbs touching. * The golf clap, unlike applause, is a timid and practically silent clapping of the palms together, to silently approve of something. It may be performed when loud applause is inappropriate; however, it may instead be done in mockery or to display faux approval. * Hand-rubbing, rubbing both hands palms together along the fingers' direction may mean that one is expecting or anticipating something or that one feels cold. U.S. servicemen surrendering with raised hands during the Battle of Corregidor * Hands up is a gesture expressing military surrender by lifting both hands. This may have originated with the concept of exposing one's hands to show one is unarmed and not a threat, and the utility of this gesture is still employed in captures and arrests. Hand heart * Hand heart is a recent pop culture symbol meaning love. The hands form the shape of a heart. Jazz hands * Jazz hands are used in dance or other performances by displaying the palms of both hands with fingers splayed. * The Kung fu salute or baoquan li Ê≠¶ÊúØÊä±Êã≥Á§º is a formal demonstration of respect between kung fu practitioners in which the right hand (formed into a fist) is covered by the open left palm. * Mani Giunte is an Italian gesture used when expressing exasperation or disbelief by putting both palms together in prayer and moving them down and back up towards your chest repeatedly. Also known as the \\"Mother of God\\". * Mano a borsa is an Italian gesture, used when something is unclear. It is created by extending all the digits on the hand bringing them together with palms facing up and moving the hand up and down by the action of the wrist and/or elbow. It implies a question, such as \\"what do you want?\\", \\"what are you saying?\\" or \\"what is your point?\\", and it generally requires a response. This gesture can be done with either hand or both hands. * Maru, (literally \\"circle\\") in Japanese culture is a gesture made by holding both arms curved over the head with the hands joined, thus forming a circular shape, to express that something is \\"correct\\" or \\"good\\". This is the counterpart of \\"batsu\\", above, though its daily use is not quite as widespread. The Merkel-Raute * Merkel- Raute: Described as \\"probably one of the most recognizable hand gestures in the world\\", the signature gesture of Angela Merkel has become a political symbol used by both her supporters and opponents. *Ogham: There is direct evidence for the existence of a system of ogham hand signals. The ogam tract In Lebor Ogaim mentions two forms of finger spelling; cossogam ('foot-ogham') and sronogam ('nose-ogham'). Cossogam involves putting the fingers to the right or left of the shinbone for the first or second aicmi, and across it diagonally or straight for the third or fourth aicmi. One finger is used for the first letter, two for the second, and so on. Sronogam involves the same procedure with the ridge of the nose. Placing the finger straight across the shinbone or nose for the fourth aicme mimics the later, manuscript form of the letters. Another alphabet, basogam ('palm-ogham') is mentioned which seems to involve striking the hand in various ways against wood. Probably the angle of the hand indicated the aicme while the number of strikes indicated the letter. The inclusion of these alphabets in the Tract shows that a connection between the ogham letters and fingers was still known at the time the Book of Ballymote was written in the Middle Ages. Further evidence of the possible use of ogham hand gestures comes in the form of various literary references to finger signs. Plummer (1910 p cxvi) cites several works which mention the use of finger signs, including the Life of Saint Brendan. * Open palms is a gesture seen in humans and other animals as a psychological and subconscious behaviour in body language to convey trust, openness and compliance. *PIV, also referred to as Sex, is often symbolized by making a circle with the index finger and thumb in one hand, and using the index finger of the other hand to \\"penetrate\\" by inserting it into the circle and pulling it back out in a repetitive motion mimicking a phallus entering a vagina. Variations exist to demonstrate phallus entering other sexual orifices. * Praying hands, a reverent clasping of the hands together, is an expression used in most major religions during prayer. The palms of the hands are held together with the fingers extended and touching or the fingers folded upon the opposite hand. This gesture is often made with the two hands held at chest or head level, the elbows against the side, and the head bowed towards the hands. * Quenelle: The gesture created by French comedian Dieudonn√© M'Bala M'Bala was often associated with anti-Zionism or antisemitic sentiments. It is compared to the bras d'honneur and the Nazi salute. It is made by touching the shoulder of an outstretched arm with the palm of the other hand. * Shame is symbolized in North America by rubbing the back of one forefinger with the other forefinger. In the stage directions of the German libretto of Der Freisch√ºtz it is called R√ºbchen schabend which translates to scrubbing carrots. As if unaware of its meaning the English translation omits this stage direction while the film Hunter's Bride shows not the gesture but literal scrubbing of carrots. * Suck It is used to express superiority over another by forming an X with hands over the groin area. First used by wrestling group DX of the WWE in 1997. *TT: Made by making a fist and extending the thumb and index finger, making an uppercase 'T' shape. Hold your hands so the 'T' rests on both of your cheeks directly under your eyes, palms facing in. This sign indicates the user is upset or crying, as the sign illustrates tears pooling under the eyes and falling down their face. The sign is derived from South Korea, featured in popular K-pop group Twice (group)'s song called TT (song) and its corresponding dance. * T-sign: Made by holding one hand vertically and tapping the fingertips with the palm of the other hand held horizontally such that the two hands form the shape of the letter T. A variant uses the forearms in place of the hands. It is used in many sports to request a timeout; in cricket, it is used by players to request the review of the third umpire. * Victory clasp is used to exclaim victory by clasping one's own hands together and shaking them to one's side to another at, or above, one's head. * Whatever - made with the thumb and forefinger of both hands to form the letter \\"W\\", the gesture is used to signal that something is not worth the time and energy. It was popularized by the movie Clueless. * Zoltan is a sign of faith. It is made by placing the tip of one thumb on top of the other, and opening the palms of both hands to form the letter Z. Eyes and eyebrows * Akanbe, performed by pulling a lower eyelid down to expose the red underneath, often while also sticking out one's tongue, and is a childish insult in Japanese culture. A similar gesture (accompanied by the phrase \\"Mon oeil\\", \\"My eye\\") signifies disbelief in France. * Butterfly kissing, getting an eye close to another person's eye and flutter the eyelids rapidly; used to express love. * Cut-eye, gesture of condemnation in Jamaica and some of North America. * Eyebrow raising. In Marshall Islands culture, briefly raising the eyebrows is used to acknowledge the presence of another person or to signal assent. It is also commonly used in the Philippines to signal affirmation much like nodding is used in western cultures. An eyebrow flash is used for various meanings in other settings as well. * Eye-rolling, performed by rotating the eyes upward and back down; can indicate incredulity, contempt, boredom, frustration, or exasperation; can be performed unconsciously or consciously; occurs in many countries of the world, and is especially common among adolescents. It has been added to the Unicode emoji as \\"U+1F644 üôÑ face with rolling eyes\\".Emoji List 5.0. Mouth * Air kiss, conveys meanings similar to kissing, but is performed without making bodily contact. * Blowing a raspberry or Bronx cheer, signifies derision by sticking out the tongue and blowing (linguolabial trill) to create a sound similar to flatulence. * Cheek kissing, pressing one's lips to another person's cheek, may show friendship or greeting. * Duck face, a popular gesture among teenagers which involves puckering lips. The gesture is often used as a \\"funny face\\" when taking pictures. * Fish lips: sucking the lips in a manner that makes the mouth look like one of a fish. * Shush, the index finger of one hand is extended and placed vertically in front of the lips, with the remaining fingers curled toward the palm with the thumb forming a fist; used to demand or request silence from those to whom it is directed. Can be silent or accompanied by an audible \\"Sssh!\\" sound which alone has the same meaning. * Sucking-teeth, a gesture used in West Indies, depending on accent also known as a \\"steups\\"Steups, WiWords.com or \\"stiups\\" signalling disagreement, an idiom of calling something \\"foolish\\"/\\"idiotic\\" (\\"stupe\\"), or an annoyance. * Exaggerated yawning, generally with one hand held to the mouth, is used to express boredom. Made with other body parts * Anasyrma, performed by lifting the skirt or kilt; used in some religious rituals. * Bowing, lowering the torso or head; a show of respect in many cultures. * Curtsey, a greeting typically made by women, performed by bending the knees while bowing the head. * Davai vyp‚Äôyem (Russian drinking sign), the index finger is flicked against the side of the neck, just below the jaw. * Elbow bump, a greeting similar to the handshake or fist bump made by touching elbows. This gesture began to grow in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. * Eskimo kissing, a gesture in Western cultures loosely based on an Inuit greeting, performed by two people touching noses.

This test has limited value for most people experiencing infertility. Procedure In this test, sperm are incubated with several hamster eggs. After seven to twenty hours, the number of sperm penetrations per egg is measured. The hamster eggs have had the zona pellucida, the outer membrane, removed- hence, zona-free. Having all eggs penetrated by multiple sperm is considered to be a positive sign for fertility. Results suggest that men whose sperm fail the hamster test are a third as fertile than those whose sperm pass. Donated sperm and intracytoplasmic sperm injection techniques are considered more strongly for those whose sperm fail this test. Contrary to some assertions by medical professionals, if the human sperm penetrates the hamster egg, a hybrid embryo is indeed created. The resulting hamster-hybrid is known as a humster. These embryos are typically destroyed before they divide into two cells and are never known to have been implanted in either a hamster or human uterus to develop. This test evaluates the acrosome reaction of human spermatozoa. However, the incidence of acrosome reaction in freely swimming human sperm does not accurately reflect the fertilizing ability of the sperm. Legal permit The practice is made licensable in the United Kingdom by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Significance This test has a poor predictive value for the success of fertilization in IVF treatment at any insemination concentration. No strong correlation has been found between hamster egg penetration rates and the various semen parameters and the role of the hamster egg penetration test in the investigation of the causes of infertility should be evaluated further. However, a negative result on the hamster test correlates with a lower probability of the man's partner becoming pregnant.

The goal of glacial morphology is to gain a better understanding of glaciated landscapes, and the way they are shaped. Types of glaciers can range from massive ice sheets, such as the Greenland ice sheet, to small cirque glaciers found perched on mountain tops. Glaciers can be grouped into two main categories: # Ice flow is constrained by the underlying bedrock topography # Ice flow is unrestricted by surrounding topography Unconstrained Glaciers Vatnaj√∂kull ice cap in Iceland =Ice sheets and Ice Caps= Ice Sheets and Ice Caps cover the largest areas of land in comparison to other glaciers, and their ice is unconstrained by the underlying topography. They are the largest glacial ice formations, and hold the vast majority of the world's fresh water.  Ice Sheets  Ice sheets are the largest form of glacial formation. They are continent sized ice masses that span areas over 50 000 km2 They are dome shaped, and similarly to ice caps, exhibit radial flow. As ice sheets expand over the ocean, they become ice shelves. Ice sheets contain 99% of all the freshwater ice found on Earth, and form as layers of snow fall, accumulate, and slowly start to compact into ice. There are only two ice sheets present on Earth today, and they are the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the Greenland Ice Sheet. Although only a tenth of modern Earth is covered by ice sheets, the Pleistocene epoch was characterized by ice sheets that covered a third of our land. This was also known as the Last Glacial Maximum  Ice Caps  An ice cap can be defined as a dome shaped mass of ice that exhibits a radial flow. They are often easily confused with ice sheets, but these ice structures are smaller in size. They are smaller than 50 000 km2, and obscure the entirety of the topography they span. They mainly form in polar and sub-polar regions that can be characterized by having particularly high elevation, but flat ground. Ice caps come in a variety of shapes; they can be round or circular, to irregular in shape. Oftentimes, ice caps gradually merge into ice sheets; making them quite hard to track and document. Some examples of ice caps include: * Jostedalsbreen, Norway * Devon Ice Cap, Canada * Barnes Ice Cap, Canada * Vatnaj√∏kull, Iceland = Ice Domes = An ice dome is a part of an ice cap or ice sheet that is characterized by upstanding ice surface located in the accumulation zone. Ice domes are nearly symmetrical, with a convex or parabolic surface shape. They tend to develop evenly over a land mass that may be either a topographic height or a depression‚Äîoften reflecting the sub-glacial topography. In ice sheets, domes may reach a thickness that may exceed 3,000 m. However, in ice caps, the thickness of the dome is much smaller; measuring roughly up to several hundred metres in comparison. In glaciated islands, ice domes are usually the highest point of the ice cap. An example of an ice dome is Kupol Vostok Pervyy in Alger Island, Franz Josef Land, Russia. = Ice Streams = Ice streams rapidly channel ice flow out to the sea, ocean, or an ice shelf. For this reason, they are commonly referred to as the \\"arteries\\" of an ice sheet. Ice from continental sheets is drained into the ocean by a complex network of ice streams, and their activity is greatly affected by oceanic and atmospheric processes. They feature a higher velocity in the centre of the stream, and are bounded by slow moving ice on either side. Periods of greater ice stream flow result in more ice transfer from ice sheets to the ocean; subsequently impacting sea level by raising it. At the margin between glacial ice and water, ice calving takes place as glaciers begin to fracture, and icebergs break off from the large masses of ice. Iceberg calving is a major contributor to sea level rise, but the ocean is not the only place that can experience ice calving. Calving can also take place in lakes, fjords, and continental ice cliffs. Constrained Glaciers = Icefields = Southern Patagonia Ice Field from ISS, astronaut photo. North is to the right. An icefield is an example of glacier structure that covers a relatively large area, and is usually located in areas characterized by mountain terrain. Icefields are quite similar to ice caps; however, their morphology is much more influenced by the underlying mountainous topography. The rock formations found under the icefields are variable, and rocky mountain peaks known as nunataks tend to jut out from under the surface of icefields. Some examples of icefields include: * Columbia Icefield, Canada * Juneau Icefield, Canada * Southern Patagonian Icefield, Chile & Argentina * Harding Icefield, USA =Outlet Glaciers= Outlet glaciers are often found in valleys, and they originate from major ice sheets and ice caps. They move in a singular direction that is determined by the underlying landscape. Outlet glaciers drain inland glaciers through gaps found in the surrounding topography. A higher amount of inland glacial melt ultimately increases the amount of outlet glacier output. Studies predict that outlet glaciers found in Greenland can increase the global sea level considerably following an increase in global temperature, and a subsequently higher drainage output. Some examples of outlet glaciers include: * Helheim Glacier, Greenland * Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, Greenland * Jakobshavn Glacier, Greenland * Petermann Glacier, Greenland =Valley glaciers= Grosser Aletschgletscher, Bernese Alps, Switzerland Valley Glacier Valley glaciers are outlet glaciers that provide drainage for icefields, icecaps or icesheets. The flow of these glaciers is confined by the walls of the valley they are found in; but they may also form in mountain ranges as gathering snow turns to ice. The formation of valley glaciers is restricted by formations such as terminal moraines, which are collections of unconsolidated rock material, or till deposited by the terminus of the glacier. Ice-free exposed bedrock and slopes often surround valley glaciers, providing a route for snow and ice to accumulate on the glacier via avalanches. Some examples of valley glaciers include: * Sermilik Glacier, Canada * Fl√°aj√∂kull, Iceland  Valley-head glaciers  Valley head glaciers are types of valley glaciers that are only limited to the valley head. An example of this type of valley glacier is B√¶gis√°rj√∂kull, found in Iceland.  Fjords  True fjords are formed when valley glaciers retreat and sea water fills the now empty valley. They can be found in mountainous, glaciation affected terrain. Some examples of fjords include: * Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland * Hornsund, Svalbard * Sognefjord, Norway * An existing valley glacier of this type is Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland Piedmont glaciers Elephant Foot Glacier, a well-known Piedmont glacier in Romer Lake, northeastern Greenland.Elephant Foot Glacier at NASA Earth Observatory Image of a Piedmont Glacier Piedmont glaciers are a subtype of valley glaciers which have flowed out onto lowland plains, where they spread out into a fan-like shape. Some examples of piedmont glaciers include: * Malaspina Glacier, USA * Endeavor Piedmont Glacier, Antarctica Cirque glaciers Lower Curtis Glacier is a cirque glacier in the North Cascades in the State of Washington. Image of a Cirque Glacier Cirque glaciers are glaciers that appear in bowl shaped valley hollows. Snow easily settles in the topographic structure; it is turned to ice as more snow falls and is subsequently compressed. When the glacier melts, a cirque structure is left in its place. Some examples cirque glaciers include: * Lower Curtis Glacier, USA * Eel Glacier, USA  Hanging Glacier  A hanging glacier is a form of glacier that appears in a hanging valley, and has the potential to break off from the side of the mountain it is attached to. As bits and pieces of hanging glaciers break off and begin to fall, avalanches can be triggered.

Fenders, used on all types of vessels, from cargo ships to cruise ships, ferries and personal yachts, prevent damage to vessels and berthing structures. To do this, fenders have high energy absorption and low reaction force.http://max- groups.com/rubber-fenders-types-things-note/ Fenders are typically manufactured out of rubber, foam elastomer or plastic. Rubber fenders are either extruded or made in a mold. The type of fender that is most suitable for an application depends on many variables, including dimensions and displacement of the vessel, maximum allowable stand-off, berthing structure, tidal variations and other berth-specific conditions. The size of the fender unit is based on the berthing energy of the vessel which is related to the square of the berthing velocity. Historically, fenders were knotted from rope in a variety of patterns and shapes. Often damaged lines would be used for this, because they could not be used to safely moor a ship or carry a load anymore. Rope fenders are still used today by historic boat owners and are still offered by a small number of sellers. Yachts, small leisure craft and support vessels typically have mobile fenders which are placed between the boat and the dock as the boat approaches the dock. Docks and other marine structures, such as canal entrances and bases of bridges, have permanent fenders placed to avoid damage from boats. Old tires are often used as fenders in such places. Fendering is also used on ports and berths as well. The fendering systems act as elastic buffer devices that are used to slow ships down and prevent damage to the ship or dock structure in the mooring process. Types =Ship to Berth (STB) Fendering= A cylindrical fender in a harbour in ItalyMarine fenders are used at ports and docks on quay walls and other berthing structures. They absorb the kinetic energy of a berthing vessel and thus prevent damage to the vessel or the berthing structure. There are 2 major categories of fenders for port applications: Fixed and Floating. Fixed fenders are mounted to the berth structure and compose of buckling fenders such as cell fenders, V-type fenders, and non-buckling fenders such as cylindrical fenders. Floating fenders are placed between the berth structure and ship, and include pneumatic fenders and foam-filled fenders. Fender spacing should be determined by the smallest ship using the berth, as well as the design ships' hull radius of curvature. To ensure all ships can be accommodated at the berth, fender spacing should be about 5‚Äì10% of the ship's length for vessels up to 20,000 dwt. Berths handling larger ships can should have a fender spacing of about 25‚Äì50% of the ship's length. Design life of port fenders will vary by ship type, berthing frequency, temperature, saltwater content, and other environmental factors. Fender manufacturers recommend a design life of 5‚Äì15 years on berths accepting general cargo, while 10‚Äì20 years for more specialized berths such as those accepting tanker ships. Damaged fendering equipment is the responsibility of either the port owner or ship owner. Port owner responsibility includes damages by ordinary wear and tear by ships, weathering, faulty mounting, incorrect fender type, etc. Ship owner responsibility includes any damages to the fendering system caused by the ship, such as crashing into the berth structure during berthing. =Ship to Ship (STS) Fendering= A Yokohama fender For bunkering operations between two vessels, floating fenders such as pneumatic or foam elastomer fenders are typically used. Fender shape, function and application =Cylindrical fenders= Cylindrical fenders are commonly used fenders that ensure safe and linear berthing for different kinds of vessels. Cylindrical (extruded) fenders are an economical solution to protect most berthing structures and offer ease of installation. In France, professional mariners call them \\"bougnafles.\\" =Arch fenders= Arch fenders were introduced to improve upon the performance of Cylindrical fenders. Arch fenders have a better Energy / Reaction force ratio and are recommended for all types of applications. The shape of these fenders helps to dissipate the stresses evenly. These extruded fenders are very easy to install and are maintenance-free. They are generally preferred for small to medium range vessels. =Cone fenders= Cone fenders are an improved version of Cell type Fender recently introduced and recommended for all types of applications, including high tidal variation sites. This advanced feature of the lesser height of fenders improves the material handling capabilities of Deck / Vessel Cranes, which reduces the overall cost of the project. Due to the geometrical shape of the fenders, it can deflect more, and it can absorb more energy from any direction. Maintaining reaction force but doubling energy absorption can be achieved by using two identical cone fenders in a back-to-back arrangement. To distribute the reaction force, cone fenders are typically supplied with large fender panels, which keeps the hull pressure low. =Pneumatic fenders= These fenders are extensively used for ship to ship transfers at mid seas, double banking operations, and as vessel-to-berth at dock/jetties. The unique property of a pneumatic fender is its low reaction force at low deflection. This property of pneumatic fenders makes them the most suitable fender for liquid cargo vessels and defense vessels with sensitive equipment. These fenders have excellent energy absorption characteristics and linear load- deflection characteristics. Pneumatic fenders should comply to the ISO 17357 standard.http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=55715 The pneumatic fender is also known as the Yokohama fender or floating fender. Four basic types of pneumatic fenders comply with the international standard: Type I (Chain&Tyre Net Type), Type II (Sling Type), Type III (Rib Type), and Type IV (Rope Net Type). It has become an ideal ship protection medium used extensively by large tankers, LPG vessels, ocean platforms, etc. The most appropriate type will depend on its application and the requirements of the equipment.http://max-groups.com/products/pneumatic-fender-boat-fender =Hydro-pneumatic fenders= The submarine hydro-pneumatic fender (SHPF), first developed in the 1980s, is a unique fender system designed to provide minimal hull pressure loads and soft compression during berthing and a large stand-off to accommodate the sizeable bulbous shape of the submarine. Its pneumatic fenders body is more robust than standard pneumatic fenders and is equipped with a specially designed counterweight to keep the fender vertical in the water. Each SHPF system is customized specially for each type or class of submarine, depending on its water-air ratio, the shape of the hull, berthing-type, energy absorption, and jetty design. =Foam elastomer fenders= These fenders are typically made of a closed-cell Polyethylene foam core, which is encapsulated in nylon or Kevlar reinforced Polyurethane skin. The performance of foam elastomer fenders is comparable to that of a pneumatic fender, but the fenders will not lose their function in case the skin gets punctured. Foam elastomer fenders cannot deflate. =D fenders= D-type fenders are commonly used on vessels as well as small jetties. They are compression-molded with steel inserts if required. =Corner fenders= 45 degree shaped fenders are commonly used on docks to protect incoming vessels. They are typically compression-molded with steel inserts if required. =Square fenders= Square fenders are commonly used on vessels as well as small jetties. They are compression-molded fenders generally used on tugs, boats, and ships. Do have excellent seawater resistance and resistance to ozone aging and ultraviolet rays. =Keyhole fenders= Keyhole fenders are the most versatile bow, stem fenders used on tugboats, and small port craft/ferries. They offer maximum protection to tugs/ferries with their typical profile and load-absorbing capabilities. =Tugboat fenders= type V2-ME-A1 tug, alongside , at the Golden Gate at San Francisco, California, 1950s. On the bow is a tugboat fender, also called beards or bow pudding, which are rope padding to protect the bow. Tugboat fenders are made of high- abrasion-resistance rubber with good resilience properties. They are very popular with small port craft owners and tug owners. These fenders are compression molded in high-pressure thermic-fluid-heated molds and have excellent seawater resistance. Tugboat fenders are also called beards or bow pudding. In the past, they were made of rope for padding to protect the bow. =Solid rubber fender= Solid rubber fenders have a long history and come in a wide range of anti-collision equipment. They operate by managing shear, rotation, and compression forces depending on the fender structure. Designs include D type, cone type, drum type, fan-shaped, rectangular, and cylindrical. Solid rubber fenders have high energy absorption and reaction force, are low cost, have a long service life, and are easy to install and maintain. In addition to their use on vessels, they are often found protecting docks as well. =Floating rubber fender= Floating rubber fenders made of solid rubber are newer protective shipboard equipment. They feature sizeable compressive deformation energy absorption, low reaction force, ability to sail, and easy installation. They can adapt to changes in the tide for dockside installations. Fender design There are a number of different standards used worldwide to design fender systems. The most commonly used one, is the PIANC \\"Guidelines for the design of fender systems, 2002\\",PIANC - Technical Report article which is the update of its predessecor from 1984. In Japan the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) are commonly used, whereas in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, the British Standard BS 6349:part 4 still used quite regularly.BS 6349-4:1994 - Maritime structures. Code of practice for design of fendering and mooring systems ‚Äì BSI British Standards Designing a fender system basically is determining what the berthing energy of a vessel or range of vessels will be, then determine what capacity the fender needs to have to absorb that kinetic energy and finally how to find a way to avoid the reaction force creating too much hull pressure. In principle, a berthing energy calculation is a simple kinetic energy calculation, adjusted for specific behaviour of a berthing vessel or the specific characteristics of the berthing location or structure.

His parents were Andrew Sloan and Susan Bass Clark Sloan. Early life and family Site of the now-destroyed Sloan log house The Sloan family emigrated from Ireland in the early nineteenth century following the American Revolution; Earl's father settled in Venango County, Pennsylvania. The family home was a small log house on Sandusky Street in Zanesfield. Earl's father was a horse harness maker, who served as a pioneer veterinary surgeon for central Ohio, and he bought and sold horses for the army during the Civil War. He had a certain ability with horses and spent as much time caring for animals as he did in mending saddles. From a formula reportedly given to him by the Indians (though this is uncertain), Andrew made a strong-smelling brown concoction that was applied to horses' shoulders when they stiffened from the spring ploughing. The formula grew to be in great demand in the area. Andrew Sloan pursued his skill with healing animals until he was a self-taught veterinarian, becoming known as the \\"Village Vet\\" and \\"Doc Sloan.\\" A notice that appeared in the Logan County Gazette on September 6, 1856, advertised: > Dr. Andrew Sloan takes this method of informing his old friends, who have so > liberally patronized him for many years, that he is now prepared to practice > as a Veterinary Surgeon, and will attend to any call in his profession in > Logan and adjoining counties. Dr. S. professes to cure Poll Evil, Spavin, > Splints, Curb, Callous, Sweney, Shoulder-jam, or any other disease, external > or internal. So bring on your cripples. Residence at Zanesfield. > ANDREW SLOAN. > N.B. Dr Sloan is prepared to furnish stable or pasture for horses from a > distance. Medicines of all sorts furnished, and prescriptions given. - > Charges reasonable. Earl attended school in Zanesfield's old school building, directly across the street from his home. He did not attend more than the elementary grades, but did learn to read and developed a great appreciation for books. Townspeople recalled that Earl was mischievous as a youth and objected to the nickname \\"Spider\\" that was attached to him for reasons unknown. Under the tutelage of Frank Pope, Earl also became a harness-maker, beginning his apprenticeship at the age of fifteen.  Entrance into the market  In 1871, a 23-year-old Earl, armed with several bottles of his father's horse liniment, joined with his brother Foreman in St. Louis, Missouri, where Foreman was engaged in the buying and shipping of horses. This time period immediately following the Civil War marked the heyday of the horse in American life. Consequently, the Sloan liniment formula was in great demand. For about twenty-five years, Earl and his brother peddled their remedy from farm to farm, and also worked the horse fairs and carnivals. At some point in the brothers' venture, someone applied the liniment to his back, discovering that it relieved his own discomfort, as well. Thereafter, the Sloan brothers began selling even more of the liniment advertising it as \\"good for man and beast\\". Earl risked the money necessary for advertisements in Chicago's streetcars, and in time, the orders for the liniment multiplied.  Later years  Sloan Library in Zanesfield, built with money donated by Sloan On February 8, 1899, at the age of fifty, Earl Sloan married Bertha Woolaver (occasionally spelled \\"Wolaver\\"), a Newport native, who had gone to Boston to pursue a nursing career. Just prior to their engagement, Earl had been having dinner at Bertha's father's house in Nova Scotia, and had asked for an introduction. What followed was a whirlwind courtship, followed soon after by Earl's proposal to her, giving her two weeks to prepare for their wedding and a trip to Europe afterward, which would serve as both a honeymoon and a business trip. The couple never had children. In 1900, Foreman Sloan left the business, but Earl continued, adopting his father's title \\"Doctor\\" and organizing a company to manufacture the liniment. The company offices were moved to Boston in 1904 when Dr. Sloan purchased a large factory building, formerly owned by Green's Nervura Medicine Company. On October 26 of that same year, the business was incorporated as \\"Dr. Earl S. Sloan, Incorporated.\\" Records in the office of the Secretary of State for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts disclose that the authorized capital for the new corporation consists of $50,000, $10 per parcel. The principals of the new corporation were Dr. Sloan, Archie MacKeigan, and Andrew Sloan, who served as the Treasurer. A business report of the time indicated that \\"the concern is recorded as one of the largest of its kind and goods are sold extensively throughout the country.\\" Dr. Sloan's business grew rapidly due to his advertising efforts. He was particularly fond of newspaper advertising. Dr. Sloan's promotional efforts included frequent travel. A newspaper article from 1907 announced that he had completed arrangements for an extended trip through Great Britain and Europe during the summer months of that year. Dr. and Mrs. Sloan made their home at Pine Lodge in Roxbury, Massachusetts. It was purchased in 1909 and included , located on the east side of Cottage Avenue. In all, the house included twelve rooms, three baths, and nine fireplaces, and was luxuriantly furnished.  End of Sloan's ownership of the business  On May 29, 1913, the principals of William R. Warner & Co. entered into an agreement for the purchase of Dr. Sloan's business. The transaction was completed in July of that year, with Warner & Co. taking over all the assets and property. A letterhead of that time included a notice that Dr. Sloan had offices in Ontario, England, Australia, and Amsterdam. Notes also exist on the sales of the liniment in the Netherlands and South America. The big seller that year was the 25-cent-size bottle of liniment; other sizes were retailed at fifty cents and one dollar. References *Donald W.

Beginning (1993-1994) K-1's eight-year history began with the revolutionary vision of Japan's Kazuyoshi Ishii. Following a rapid climb through the ranks as martial arts mentor, promoter, and official, Ishii thought it was time to organize a major martial arts event. Its concept was to decide the strongest martial artist in a night, inspired from Akira Maeda's Fighting Network RINGS. Maeda himself liked Ishii's K-1 concept and helped him to establish it. Karate was closely resembling the style of kick boxing. Ishii organized the first K-1 Grand Prix at the Yoyogi Dai-Ichi Stadium in Tokyo on April 30, 1993. The event was held in a regulation-size boxing ring under the K-1 rules, which permit punches to accommodate both karate and kick boxing fighters. A crowd of 10,000 were on hand to witness history in the making as a young Ernesto Hoost and Peter Aerts, before they won a combined total of seven WGPs between the two. They faced one another in a preliminary fight of the Grand Prix. The match was an instant classic as they gave it their all but in the end it was Aerts' unfamiliarity with the three round style of K-1 (normal kickboxing fights usually have five rounds) that caused him to start out slow in the first round. He did not have enough time to catch up with the very capable Hoost who was awarded the unanimous decision. Hoost would knock out former UFC champion and former American kickboxing champion Maurice Smith in the semi finals with a headkick assuring; he advanced to the finals. Aerts' teammate Branko Cikatiƒá was the big winner of the WGP that night as he put on a dominant performance knocking out Changpuek Kiatsongrit, Japan's then number one kickboxer Masaaki Satake, and Ernesto Hoost in the finals.Maylam, J. (2001): K-1 hits the spot: Ultimate fighters pack a punch The Japan Times (October 21, 2001). Retrieved on January 31, 2014. Later in the same year, the K-2 Grand Prix was held, which was a tournament in the light heavyweight class. Ernesto Hoost knocked out Changpuek Kiatsongrit in the final. Golden Age (1994-1999) Popular fighters in the K-1 during the golden age included, Masaaki Satake, Branko Cikatic, Changpuek Kiatsongrit, Peter Aerts, Ernesto Hoost, Andy Hug, Stan Longinidis, Jerome Le Banner, Mike Bernardo, Musashi, Mirko Filipoviƒá, Francisco Filho, Sam Greco, Stefan Leko, Ray Sefo, Matt Skelton, Rick Roufus, Lloyd van Dams, and Xhavit Bajrami. =1994= In 1994, K-1 held an event called \\"K-1 Challenge\\" which was headlined by a double main event. In the first main event, Japan's number one kickboxer Masaaki Satake took on Ernesto Hoost. The match ended rather quickly when Hoost scored with a high kick to Satake's head for the knockout. The second main event was an eagerly anticipated standoff between the reigning WGP champion Branco Cikatic and a famous karate champion Andy Hug. Hug was very well known in Japan as he had won numerous karate tournaments all over the world and had a very popular fighting style. The match was an exciting five rounder with both men knocking the other down but neither showing true dominance. In the end the judges gave Hug the very close unanimous decision to the cheers of the grateful crowd. In the second edition of the World Grand Prix, the field of eight participants was stronger than the previous year. Along with the defending champion Branco Cikatic, Peter \\"The Dutch Lumberjack\\" Aerts, Satake, Andy Hug made his anticipated WGP debut. Many believed Hug was a heavy favorite to win it all considering he already beat Cikatic a few months earlier but that was not to be. In Hug's first fight he was upset by American kickboxer Patrick Smith in nineteen seconds after being knocked to the ground two quick times which stunned the Japanese crowd. After Hug's early elimination the WGP was anyone's to claim. Aerts, Satake and Cikatic all passed their first round fights with relative ease. In the semi-finals Smith was not able to upset Aerts as the \\"Dutch Lumberjack\\" took Smith out with a hard punch in the first round. In a rematch from last year's WGP Satake and Cikatic collided again but this time it was Satake who was given the win by unanimous decision. In the finals with a very hot crowd cheering them on, Aerts and Satake went a full three rounds before the judges crowned Peter Aerts the youngest and second ever K-1 World Grand Prix Champion at the age of 23, a record that as of 2008 is still intact. Later in 1994 K-1 held their next event titled K-1 Revenge and was named because of the main event which showcased the rematch between Andy Hug and the man who upset his WGP chances earlier in the year, Patrick Smith. The crowd was very hot for this match and were purely behind Hug. In an amazing reversal of the outcome to their first match Hug was able to get his revenge by knocking out Smith with a knee to the face in less than a minute into the first round. The K-1 Revenge show also showcased a WKA title match between champion Dennis Lane and Masaaki Satake. The Japanese fans were of course behind Satake and to their enjoyment watched as his brutal leg kicks left Lane hobbling so badly that his corner threw in the towel in the second round giving Satake the title. Also on the card was the K-1 debut of another acclaimed kickboxing and karateka fighter, the Greek Stan Longinidis. Stan \\"the Man\\" debut against another champion, 1993 WGP champion Branco Cikatic. The match displayed both men's ability to dish out and take a beating but after five tough rounds Stan \\"the Man' was given the unanimous decision. K-1 closed out 1994 with K-1 Legend a show that was headlined by Masaaki Satake against yet another debuting herald kickboxing champion, Australia born Sam Greco. In what many considered a dominating performance, Greco used his brute strength to pound Satake in the second round before he landed a hard solid right that put the Japanese fighter down for the count. In a rematch from the 1993 WGP finals, Branco Cikatic went against Ernesto Hoost. Hoost was looking for a chance to avenge his knock lost to the big Croatian but that was not meant to be as a mighty left hook put Hoost out cold on the mat in almost a repeat from their first fight. =1995= In 1995 K-1 decided to have a preliminary elimination round for their WGP. To determine the final eight, sixteen men duked it out. Along with fan favorites Ernesto Hoost, defending WGP champion Peter Aerts, Sam Greco and Stan the Man, a few new faces debuted in the K-1 ranks. Young French kickboxer Jerome Le Banner made his K-1 debut with a decision win over Muay Thai champion Nokueed Devy. Another man to make his K-1 debut albeit in more impressive fashion was South African fighter Mike Bernardo who was set up against Andy Hug, in another attempt to make it to the WGP. For Hug, like last year he would be upset again by a vicious flurry of strikes in the third round that displayed Bernardo's brutal power. Lastly Japanese kickboxer Masaaki Satake got his win over infamous street fighter Kimo in a horrible match that showed Kimo's lack of fighting ability. In the 1995 WGP, Jerome Le Banner upset Satake with a brutal punch to the face that crumbled him to the mat in the third round. Two heavy head kicks from Mike Bernardo got him past Stan the Man. While both Peter Aerts and Ernesto Hoost easily passed their first round opponents to make it to the semi finals. In a very brutal fight both Bernardo and Le Banner took the fight to each other but it was Le Banner's leg kicks that literally crippled Bernardo and stopped his streak to the WGP finals. In another classic clash Aerts and Hoost went to an extra fourth round after their first three rounds were considered a draw. In the fourth round Aerts looked to be a bit more aggressive and was given the chance to defend his WGP title in the finals against Le Banner. In the finals Aerts made quick work over the young \\"French Cyborg\\" by punching him in the gut and crowning himself the first two time WGP champion. 1995 marked the beginning of K-1's expansion. The first K-1 Fight Night outside Japan took place in Switzerland with Andy Hug hosting. K-1 ended 95 with two big events. The first was the second K-1 Revenge. Like last year's edition K-1 Revenge II allowed Andy Hug the chance to gain revenge on a past lost, this time against Mike Bernardo. This time around Hug was not able to gain revenge and was knocked out in the second round by a mighty left hook. Also on the show defending WGP champion Peter Aerts fought against Kyokushin fighter Sam Greco in a very competitive five round battle. In the end Aerts was given the close decision. K-1 Revenge II was also significant for the debut of a young Seido Kaikan fighter, MUSASHI who end up becoming one of the most successful Japanese fighters in K-1. In MUSASHI's debut he was put against the man who defeated his idol, Andy Hug a year earlier, Patrick Smith. MUSASHI ended up defeating Smith in a dominating performance topped off with a 2nd-round KO. The last event of 1995 was K-1's Hercules event which was headlined by two big matches. The first was a five-round battle between Andy Hug and Jerome Le Banner which ended in a decision win for Andy Hug. The main event was a big clash between defending WGP champion Peter Aerts and rising upstart Mike Bernardo, who was coming off two dominant wins over Andy Hug. The match was not long and ended in controversy when in the opening seconds Aerts gave Bernardo a flurry of punches one of which hit him right in the back of the head. Bernardo went down hard and was not moving for a few seconds which caused the referee to stop the fight. Immediately, when the bell rang Bernardo got up and protested the decision but the referee would not listen. This would mark the beginning of a very serious and personal feud between the two K-1 stars. =1996= 1996 began with a bang in the WGP qualifier. Eight of the best K-1 fighters fought to gain their place in the WGP. The usual suspects won their fights with ease including defending two-time champion Peter Aerts, Ernesto Hoost, MUSASHI, Sam Greco, Mike Bernardo, Stan the Man and Andy Hug. \\"French Cyborg\\" Jerome Le Banner was supposed to join his fellow K-1 fighters and had a relative newcomer standing in his way named Mirko \\"the Tiger\\" but people today know him as Mirko Filipoviƒá. Before \\"Crocop\\" became a MMA star in PRIDE and UFC he started as a kickboxer in K-1. In his debut fight he stunned many by going toe to toe with Le Banner and got awarded a slim decision victory and a chance to participate in the WGP finals. The 1996 WGP is, to many, one of the best K-1 WGPs in the history of K-1, not only due to the quality of competitors but because of the emotional ending. In the first match Mike Bernardo beat Peter Aerts with a right hook in the third round to avenge his controversial lost to the \\"Dutch Lumberjack\\" last year and end the chances of Aerts becoming a three-time WGP champion. In the second first round match two famous Japanese schools of Karate collided when Seido Kaikan fighter MUSASHI took on Kyokushin fighter Sam Greco. This match ended after one round when Greco broke his toe and could not continue. Ernesto Hoost took care of the young Mirko Filipoviƒá after three rounds while Andy Hug made even shorter work Duane Van Der Merwe after a vicious KO ending the fight in 40 seconds. In the semis Bernardo got the unanimous decision over MUSASHI, while Hoost faced Andy Hug in one of the best K-1 fights up to this point which went into an extra round and saw Hug win by a slim margin. In the miracle final Andy Hug, the man that was destined to become a K-1 WGP champion but was stopped prematurely two times in a row finally made it to the finals. After two rounds Hug wore down the mighty Bernardo with leg kicks which crippled Beranrdo significantly. After another brutal kick Bernardo crumpled to the ground and was given a standing eight count, the Japanese crowd were on their feet cheering on Hug. Seconds later a beautiful spinning leg sweep from Hug brought down Bernardo again and as the referee and crowd counted Bernardo out, Hug gave a triumphant cry of victory and finally became a WGP champion. The third K-1 Revenge event was a star-studded affair. In this event reigning WGP champion Andy Hug added another title to his kickboxing career beating Stan the Man to win the World Muay Thai Championship after a brutal second-round knockout. With the theme of the K-1 Revenge being all about revenge the double header main event featured Sam Greco fighting against Musashi to avenge his early loss to the Seido Kaikan fighter when he broke his toe. In this fight neither fighter would be able to claim victory as during a heated struggle Musashi fell out of the ring and hit his head on the concrete floor. Dazed but determined to fight Musashi tried to continue but the doctor at ringside stopped the fight and called the fight a No Contest. In the main event the Bernardo/Aerts feud escalated to a new level. Trying to avenge his early WGP lost, Aerts started the fight aggressive as ever but less than midway through the first round one of his kicks hit Bernardo in the groin. Bernardo slowly crumbled to the ground but could not get up. The referee gave Bernardo time to recover but he was not moving and claimed he could not continue. With Bernardo unable to continue, the referee issued a DQ to Aerts for the low blow, giving Bernardo the win. To end the 1996 year K-1 held two final events. The first titled Star Wars was just that, a war between the top stars of K-1. \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Ernesto Hoost took on the young Jerome Le Banner in a very back and forth contest. During the second it looked like Hoost would take another win but out of nowhere he got tagged hard by Le Banner seconds later Le Banner knocked Hoost down hard. The ref gave Hoost a standing eight count even though it was obvious that Hoost was completely out of it, the ref still gave Hoost the chance to continue fighting. This proved futile as seconds later Le Banner knocked Hoost completely out for the stunning upset. In the next fight eternal rivals Mike Bernardo and Peter Aerts clashed again. Results of their last few fights were still fresh in these two fighters minds as they went all out for a good three rounds till out of nowhere Bernardo blasted Aerts with a knockout blow giving Bernardo a 3‚Äì1 lead in their rivalry. To continue a trend, Andy Hug added yet another title to his collection by gaining the World KickBoxing Associate championship after a five-round slugfest with returning Japanese fighter Massaki Satake. The final event of 1996 was the K-1 Hercules event. In this event for the first time two draws were given, the first between Mike Bernardo and Stan the Man and the second between Sam Greco and the \\"French Cyborg\\" Jerome Le Banner. The K-1 Hercules event is significant to K-1 fans due to it being the debut event of New Zealand fighter Ray Sefo. For Sefo he had the daunting task of fighting against \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Ernesto Hoost. For the young Kiwi, Sefo gave it his all but after a series of brutal leg kicks Sefo was unable to get off the mat and Hoost was awarded the KO victory. In the main event the streaking Hug was able to defeat the young MUSASHI. =1997= The 1997 K-1 Kings event was truly an affair fit for a king as reigning K-1 WGP champion Andy Hug took on two time K-1 champion Peter Aerts in the main event. The fight did not last long as Aerts stopped the streaking Hug with a heavy assault of punches that knocked the \\"blue eye samurai\\" out in the first round. Also on the card Mike Bernardo destroyed Masaaki Satake in two rounds while the very first WGP Champion Branco Cikatic made his K-1 return by overpowering the young MUSASHI in four rounds. The 1997 K-1 Braves event was significant for several things. One of them was the debut of Stefan Leko, a young kickboxing champion from Germany. Another significant event was the return of Ray Sefo to the K-1 ring where he knocked out the French cyborg Jerome Le Banner with a crushing right hook dubbed the \\"Boomerang Hook\\". Also on the card Sam Greco fought his second consecutive draw with Andy Hug while the hot Mike Bernardo was stopped cold by the technical kicks of \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Ernesto Hoost. The 97 Fight Night was headlined this year by Swiss Hero and reigning WGP champion Andy Hug facing the very hot Mike Bernardo. In a very hard hitting fight both men pushed each other to the limit but after three rounds the decision went to the hailing hero Hug. The K-1 Dream event was aptly named that because of the \\"dream match\\" main event pitting Kyokushin Karate champion Franscisco Filho against reigning WGP and Seido Kaikan karate fighter Andy Hug. Karate purists were excited for this fight but were stunned by the results; in less than one round Filho knocked out Hug with an amazing right hook. This was truly the most amazing debut in K-1 history and put all other K-1 stars on notice that Filho was a contender not to take lightly. Also on the show Peter Aerts scored a huge knock out over the French Cyborg Jerome Le Banner by headkick. Ray Sefo gave a crushing beating over Jean Claude, while it only took Sam Greco two minutes to beat the first WGP champion Branco Cikotic into submission. The 1997 WGP qualifier sent the best K-1 fighters to the WGP final, with newcomer Francisco Filiho, K-1 veterans Sam Greco, Jerome Le Banner, Ernesto Hoost, 2 time WGP Champion Peter Aerts, Masaaki Satake and defending WGP champion Andy Hug all made it past the qualifier. The first WGP champion, Branco Cikatic, made his K-1 return, but was defeated by Bernardo within seconds by an accidental headbutt which made a deep cut in his head causing the doctors to stop the fight and added Bernardo's name to the list of qualifiers. The K-1 Grand Prix '97 Final was held for the first time at the Tokyo Dome, gathering 54,500 spectators. Filho continued his victorious first year in K-1 with an amazing 15 second knock out over Sam Greco in the first round. In a rematch from last year Ernesto Hoost was able to get revenge by knocking out Jerome Le Banner in an explosive furry in the first round. The never ending war between Peter Aerts and Mike Bernardo continued with their first round battle which saw Aerts walk away with the hard-fought TKO win after a kick to Bernardo's face finally put the big South African down. In the last quarter final match, defending WGP champion Hug made short work of Japan's Satake in only 15 seconds! In the semi finals the streaking Filiho came to a halt when Hoost muscled out a hard-fought three-round decision and a seat in the finals. While on the other side of the bracket WGP winners Hug and Aerts clashed in an amazing three round battle. In the end it was Hug who got the win and a chance to defend his championship. The finals saw Hoost prevent Hug's bid for a second K-1 title after three hard-fought rounds to win his first K-1 WGP title. =1998= The 98 K-1 season began with the K-1 Kings event which was headlined by newly crowned WGP champion Ernesto Hoost taking on two-time champion Peter Aerts. In another hard fought battle between the two K-1 legends, Aerts was able to score the win after knocking Hoost down in the first round and getting the unanimous decision. The K-1 Braves event was headlined by the two most recognizable Japanese K-1 fighters; the veteran Masaaki Satake and the newcomer MUSASHI. After five hard fought rounds none of the judges saw a clear victor and thus the battle between the two Japanese greats ended in a rare K-1 draw. In the annual K-1 Fight Night held in Switzerland, hometown hero Andy Hug squared off against Peter Aerts in an entertaining five round brawl. This would be the third fight between the two K-1 greats with each one having a win a piece. In the end after five rounds, Hug was given the win. On the undercard of the event Stefan Leko won the K-1 Europe GP earning a spot in the 16 man WGP qualifier. The K-1 Dream card was truly a dream for K-1 fans. Since its inception, the goal of K-1 was to see what style was the better one between traditional stand up Karate and kickboxing. Over the years many top Karate champions have joined the ranks of K-1 and fought with some of the best kickboxers in the world. Now in K-1 Dream, the theme was a seven on seven, Karate team vs Kickboxing team, to prove which style was superior. In the opening bout debuting Kyokushin Karateka Nicholas Pettas fought against the young Croatian/German Stefan Leko. Leko did not go easy on Pettas and welcomed him to the K-1 with a second-round TKO. Another debuting Kyokushin Karateka, Glaube Feitosa did not fare any better as he was knocked out by Mike Bernardo, giving Team Kickboxing a commanding lead. British kickboxer Kirkwood Walker and Dutch karateka Xhavit Bajrami went to a draw. Japanese Karateka Masaaki Satake was crushed by another British kickboxer in Matt Skeleton, while fellow Japanese fighter MUSASHI was put down by Ernesto Hoost, giving Team Kickboxing the dominant win. During Sam Greco and Jerome Le Banner's fight, it looked like Team Karate would have a chance to at least gain one win when Greco knocked down LeBanner twice in the first round. BUt miraculously in the second, LeBanner threw a right cross that crumbled Greco to the canvas. In the main event the young Brazilian Francisco Filiho squared off with two time WGP champion Peter Aerts. During the first round Aerts hurt his leg and the fight had to be stopped awarding Filiho the tainted win, and at least prevent Team Karate from being shut out in the series. 1998 saw the first United States qualifier, which took place in Las Vegas. In K-1's debut show American Kickboxer, Rick Roufus won the US GP and earned a shot at the 16 man WGP qualifier. Headlining the show was a rematch from the very first WGP where Hoost took down Maurice Smith. This time Smith lasted the full three rounds but still lost the decision. Back in Japan they were having their own GP qualifier that saw K-1 original Masaaki Satake win the GP and earn one last shot at a possible WGP victory. In the 1998 WGP qualifier last year's final 8 (Francisco Filiho, Sam Greco, 2 time WGP champion Peter Aerts, Mike Bernardo, former WGP champion Andy Hug, Masaaki Satake and defending WGP champion Ernesto Hoost) minus Jerome Le Banner who was injured, were set up against a brand new batch of would be K-1 fighters to see who would go on to the finals. All of last year's fighters made it past the qualifying round and were joined by New Zealian Ray Sefo who out muscled Stefan Leko in the qualifiers. The 1998 WGP is the shortest WGP to date with only one of the fights going to a decision. In the quarterfinals heavy favorite to make the finals Francisco Filiho was shockingly manhandled by Mike Bernardo in the third round, while it took Peter Aerts only one round to take down the Japanese Satake. In his crusade to return to the WGP finals, Andy Hug made short work of Ray Sefo while a cut forced this year's WGP defending champion Ernesto Hoost to quit sending opponent, Sam Greco to the semi finals. In the semis' the eternal rivalry continued as Aerts and Bernardo met once again. This would be the sixth time these two K-1 stars have collided and Bernardo was ahead 2‚Äì3. This time Aerts was able to tie it up by knocking out the big South African with seconds left in the first round. On the other side of the Semi finals, it took Andy Hug all three rounds to out muscle Sam Greco. In the finals Aerts became the first three time WGP champion by KOing Hug with a quick kick to the head inside of one minute in the first round. Not only did Aerts become a 3-time champion he also won this WGP in the quickest time ever 6 minutes 43 seconds. A record that stood until it was broken in 2009 by Semmy Schilt. =1999= In 1999, K-1 Revenge had some much eager rematches. The first was Japan's fading veteran Satake trying to avenge his brutal KO loss to Mike Bernardo. Satake did last a bit longer, all three rounds, but he still ended up losing the rematch. In the next Revenge match, New Zealander Ray Sefo was trying to avenge his loss to Andy Hug in the 1998 WGP Finals but an early kick to the groin plagued Sefo during the remainder of the match. Yet Sefo was all heart and every time he went down he kept coming back up to the cheers and support of the fans. By the fourth round Sefo was spent and his corner threw in the towel. In the main event Francisco Filiho was trying to avenge one of his few losses in K-1 to Mr. Perfect Ernesto Hoost. Filiho took down Hoost in less than 2 minutes from a barrage of hooks, earning his revenge. K-1 held three preliminary tournaments to determine six competitors to face the final eight fighters from last year's tournament (K-1 chose two other fighters to fill the final spots). In the first tournament (held at the \\"K-1 Braves\\" event) both former WFCA kick boxing champion Lloyd van Dams and Xhavit Bajrami were sent to the Final Elimination round. The second tournament (\\"K-1 Dreams\\") saw K-1 veteran Stefan Leko and Samir Benazzouz go forward. The final preliminary tournament held at the K-1 Japan event saw Musashi receive a pass along with Nobu Hayashi. In the 1999 Final Elimination event, these six winners along with Mirko Filipoviƒá and IFKA Superheavyweight champion, Matt Skelton, were matched up with the previous year's eight finalists minus Brazilian Francisco Filiho (who was injured) and replaced by a returning fan favorite, Jerome Le Banner. In the WGP Qualifier all of last year's finalists proved to be too tough for the new up-and-comers except for Mirko Cro Cop who made his triumphant K-1 return by taking down Mike Bernardo and MUSASHI, who defeated Satake in a fight that many point to as the passing of the torch from one Japanese star to another. In the 99 WGP Mirko Cro Cop continued his return to K-1 by pummeling MUSASHI, while in the upset of the night the French Cyborg Jerome Le Banner took down defending WGP champion Peter Aerts. In the other quarter-final matches Sam Greco out-muscled Ray Sefo while in a rematch from the 97 WGP Ernesto Hoost avenged his loss to former WGP champion Andy Hug. In the semifinals Mirko Cro Cop cemented his ticket to the finals with a knockout win over Sam Greco while Ernesto Hoost took down the hard-punching Jerome Le Banner. In the finals Hoost took advantage of what looked to be a rib injury to Mirko by attacking the body until Mirko could not continue, earning Hoost his second WGP title. Turn of the century (2000-2001) Along with many of the fighters from the golden age, the turn of the century also introduced many new fighters. Many of whom debuted in the K-1 in either 1998 or 1999 but started to gain popularity in 2000 and 2001. This would include, J√∂rgen Kruth, Nicholas Pettas, Alexey Ignashov, Jan Nortje, Remy Bonjasky, Ramon Dekkers, Hiromi Amada, Cyril Abidi, Glaube Feitosa, Doug Viney, Masato, Mark Hunt, Tsuyoshi Nakasako, and Peter Graham. =2000= 2000 marked the beginning of K-1's fascination with tournaments; 13 tournaments (8 preliminaries, 3 major blocks and then the final two) were held to determine who would make the trip to Tokyo for the World Grand Prix. This time everyone had to earn a spot, including the eight finalists of last year. After the three block tournaments, six men were set for the WGP (Le Banner, Hoost, Abidi, Filho, Bernardo and Cro Cop). Musashi won the Japan GP to go forward while the last slot went to Peter Aerts. Just weeks before the tournament was set to start, both Mike Bernardo (injured) and Jerome Le Banner (sick) had to withdraw. Ray Sefo and Stefan Leko were chosen as replacements. 2000 would mark the beginning of a new century but would also mark the tragic end of a great career and life. Andy Hug, a former WGP champion and fan favorite died on August 24, 2000 due to leukemia a few weeks before his 36 birthday. The whole K-1 community and world mourned the passing of the \\"blue eyed samurai\\". The 2000 WGP opened up with a rematch from last year's finals between defending WGP champion Ernesto Hoost and Mirko Cro Cop. This time Cro Cop lasted all three rounds but still could not muscle out the decision win. Ray Sefo made short work of MUSASHI while it took an extra round for Francisco Filiho to beat upstart Stefan Leko. In the last quarterfinal match 3 time WGP champion Peter Aerts was faced against French hot head Cyril Abidi. During the fight Abidi used every trick in the book to try and beat the more experienced Aerts. This included multiple head butts which resulted in Aerts bleeding so bad that even though he won the fight he could not continue to the next round. Due to this, Abidi got the bid to advance. In the semi finals Hoost and Filiho had another epic encounter that would be considered the fight of the night. In the end Hoost would go on to defend his championship in the finals. While on the other side of the bracket Sefo made short work of Abidi to make it to his first WGP finals. In the finals, Hoost claimed a third WGP title by winning via decision over Ray Sefo. =2001= In 2001, K-1 expanded the qualifying tournament process again to four qualifying tournaments and two repechage (second chance or loser bracket) tournaments. Like last year, everyone had to qualify to make it to the World Grand Prix in Japan. In the finals of the Osaka GP, Jerome LeBanner beat newcomer Adam Watt. In the Melbourne GP, defending WGP champion Ernesto Hoost defeated Matt Skelton. The big surprise at Melbourne was when young Mirko was knocked out by relative unknown Michael McDonald. In the Nagoya GP, 23-year-old Alexey \\"the Red Scorpion\\" Ignashov beat Lloyd van Dams. The last qualifying tournament took place in Las Vegas. In the final, Aerts was knocked out by Stefan Leko. In Fukuoka there were two four men repecharge tournaments. In the first, Filho defeated Sergei Ivanovich and then won the tournament by beating Lloyd Van Dams. In the finals of the other tournament, Mark Hunt beat Adam Watt. The final two spots of the WGP were given again to Peter Aerts and to the K-1 Japan winner (who was Nicholas Pettas this year). The WGP 2001 started out with defending champion Ernesto Hoost beating the young Stefen Leko to a three-round decision victory. Following that match was what many considered one of the most hard hitting fights in K-1 history, \\"The French Cyborg\\" Jerome LeBanner fought Mark Hunt. Hunt knocked out the favorite LeBanner in the second round. Alexey Ignashov won by KO when a well-placed knee broke the nose of his opponent Nicholas Pettas. The final first round match placed three-time champion Peter Aerts against Kyokushin Kaikan champion Francisco Filho. A misplaced kick from Aerts to Filho's elbow caused Aerts ankle to swell up, this forced Aerts to end his run for a fourth title early. Ernesto Hoost was forced out after a foot injury, allowing his first round opponent Stefen Leko to advance against Mark Hunt. In the semi-final rounds, Leko lost to Hunt by decision and Filho held off Ignashov. In the finals, Mark Hunt, who was eliminated twice on his way to getting to the WGP, was crowned the 2001 WGP champion after a three-round decision. The Dark Ages of K-1 (2002-2003) The main newcomers and other important fighters in the K-1 during the Dark Ages include, Semmy Schilt, Andy Souwer, Albert Kraus, Bob Sapp, Carter Williams, and Michael McDonald. =2002= In 2002 the K-1 heads decided to stop the long-winded tournaments as it was putting a strain on matchmakers and the fighters, as evidenced by the injuries in the last two years. So instead, they had one eight-match event with the winners going on to the finals in Tokyo. Fifteen of the fighters were chosen by K-1 while the last fighter, Michael McDonald, qualified by winning the K-1 Las Vegas tournament. The one night event was held in Saitama. Defending WGP champion Mark Hunt beat Mike Bernardo, Ray Sefo won against Martin Holm. Peter Aerts got a hard-fought victory over Glaube Feitosa while Stefan Leko defeated Alexey Ignashov in four rounds. Michael McDonald faced Semmy Schilt and took him the distance, but did not win. Jerome LeBanner beat K-1 newcomer Gary Goodridge in just 42 seconds. The main event of the night is probably one of the most infamous fights in K-1 history: in a surprise result, Hoost lost to newcomer Bob Sapp, a former American Football player and professional wrestler. Later, however, after Schilt announced he would not be competing due to injury, the K-1 heads decided to set up a rematch between Hoost and Sapp. Sapp again relied on his brute strength and after pounding Hoost in the corner for a minute, the referee stopped the match and gave a TKO victory to Sapp. However, during the fight, Sapp injured his hand and could not continue thus allowing Hoost to move on to the next round. In a more technical match, Ray Sefo took Peter Aerts to three rounds and won with a very close split decision. Defending WGP champion Mark Hunt beat Stefan Leko with a third-round KO, while Jerome LeBanner knocked out K-1 Japan champion Musashi in two rounds. In the semi- finals, Hoost beat Sefo and the judges awarded victory to LeBanner against Hunt. In the final, Hoost met LeBanner for the fifth time and overcame him to claim his unprecedented fourth title, thus solidifying his nickname, \\"Mr. Perfect\\". =2003= In 2003 K-1 founder, Kazuyoshi Ishii was charged and subsequently found guilty of tax evasion, by which he had to serve 22 months in prison. Former K-1 fighter and part-time event referee Nobuaki Kakuda, business man Sadaharu Tanikawa and fighter Bob Sapp took over as head producers of K-1 ensuring its survival. However the dynamics of K-1 changed, showcasing big muscular men that would wow the crowd with their size if not their skills. These shows were nicknamed \\"Beast\\" shows, sharing the same nickname as Bob Sapp. Even though Bob Sapp became a sensation in Japan the previous year the two \\"K-1 Beast\\" events held were disappointments in both match quality and revenue. Despite these changes, K-1 still moved forward filling in the slots for the 2003 K-1 WGP. There were four qualifying and one repecharge tournaments to fill in the remaining slots for the elimination round being held in Osaka that also included the final eight fighters from last year. American kickboxer Carter Williams earned a place with his win in the Las Vegas GP. K-1 newcomer Jerrell Venetian won the GP in Basel. Alexey Ignashov made his K-1 return by winning in Paris. Peter Graham won the GP in his home city of Melbourne while another K-1 newcomer Remy \\"Flying Gentleman\\" Bonjasky qualified for the WGP by winning the repecharge GP. The Osaka event suffered from problems: three K-1 favorites, Jerome LeBanner, Mark Hunt and Ernesto Hoost were out, the former two due to injury while Hoost was afflicted with a rare skin disease. To replace them, K-1 had to call in an aging Sam Greco, an unprepared Mike Bernardo, and Francisco Filho whose last fight was in 2001. K-1 filled the final two slots with Cyril Abidi and former heavyweight boxer Francois Botha (part of the new \\"freak show\\" initiative). Aerts dispatched Jerrell. Ignashov knocked out Mike Bernardo, while Sam Greco injured himself and had to quit his fight against Peter Graham. Stefen Leko dominated Francisco Filho in three rounds for the unanimous decision. Carter Williams hit Ray Sefo twice below the waist and then elbowed him in the back of the head which injured Sefo so badly that he could not continue the fight. Due to the rules of the match, the judges had to judge the fight by the first round (the elbow strike was deemed accidental) and Sefo was given the win. In the last two matches, both Botha and Sapp were disqualified for hitting Abidi and Bonjasky while they were on the ground in blatant illegal moves. The 2003 WGP finale took place in the Tokyo Dome. In the first round Francois Botha lost to Cyril Abidi, Peter Graham lost to the young Remy Bonjasky. Musashi won against Ray Sefo in a very close fight, and finally \\"Mr. K-1\\" Peter Aerts decisively beat Alexey Ignashov. In the semis Bonjasky beat Abidi in less than 2 minutes and Musashi beat Aerts in an exciting three rounds. In a close final the judges gave the victory to Remy Bonjasky, thereby ushering in a new generation of fighters. Return to excellence Important fighters since 2004 include, Mighty Mo, Buakaw Por.Pramuk, Kaoklai Kaennorsing, Aleksandr Pitchkounov, Choi Hong Man, Errol Zimmerman, Badr Hari, Zabit Samedov, G√∂khan Saki, Junichi Sawayashiki, Min-Soo Kim, Keijiro Maeda, and Sergei Gur. =2004= In 2004, Chad Rowan a.k.a. Akebono, the first non-Japanese sumo wrestler to win the top ranking as Yokozuna, made his debut in K-1. His much- anticipated first fight was against the \\"beast\\" Bob Sapp. However, Bob Sapp overpowered the slow Akebono in just three minutes. In the following K-1 event held in the Saitama Super Arena. Akebono faced a smaller, possibly more manageable, Musashi. The heads of K-1 assumed that Akebono's over 250 lb weight and 7 inch height advantage would make up for his lack of talent. However, although Akebono did not get knocked out he did lose by a unanimous decision. There were three qualifying tournaments for the 2004 WGP and also one repecharge tournament in Las Vegas. The first LV GP crowned McDonald as the winner taking out former boxing champion Dewey Cooper. In the Japanese GP in Shizuoka, heavy favorite, Mike Bernardo was knocked out in the first round of his fight and \\"The Beast\\" Bob Sapp was decisively beaten by Ray Sefo in the second round. Hiromi Amada won the tournament. In Seoul, Korea, the first Asian GP was held and Akebono lost again in the first round by unanimous decision. The eventual winner was Kaoklai Kaennorsing, a former Muay Thai fighter, who was the smallest fighter in the tournament (5'9\\" and 176 lbs). In the repecharge tournament, Akebono lost again, this time to American kickboxer Rick Roufus. Newcomer Mighty Mo Siligia won the final slot into the WGP. The new GP winners (McDonald, Amada, Kaoklai, Mighty Mo) along with last year's final eight (Abidi, Botha, Sefo, Musashi, Ignashov, Aerts, and defending WGP champion Bonjasky minus an injured Graham) entered the Final Elimination event in Tokyo. To fill in the final few slots the K-1 Directors selected four time WGP champion Ernesto Hoost, Glaube Feitosa, Gary Goodridge and the \\"French Cyborg\\" Jerome Le Banner to compete. In the first fight Mighty Mo beat Gary Goodridge in the first round. The second fight was between Alexey Ignashov and Kaoklai Kaennorsing. After three rounds, the judges called the match a draw forcing it to go one extra round where the young Kaennorsing won by the smallest of margins in a split decision. Both former WGP champions, Peter Aerts and Ernesto Hoost each won their matches in three rounds. K-1 veteran Ray Sefo beat Japan GP winner Hiromi Amada. In this year's elimination tournament the defending WGP champion was given a bye straight to the final eight but still had to fight a superfight match. For Remy Bonjasky the K-1 directors decided to match him up with Akebono who again lost. Musashi just won against Cyril Abidi, and Francois Botha beat Jerome Le Banner when after the match was called a draw, the Le Banner could not continue the fight for the fourth round and instead gave up. The 2004 WGP was controversial: many K-1 fans and media members cited numerous matches in this WGP as suspicious of unfair/poor judging by the ringside judges. However, the first fight of the night had no controversy as the diminutive Kaoklai Kaennorsing took on the heaviest fighter of the night, Mighty Mo. Kaennorsing took him down with a swift kick to the head in the first round. The second fight was the first controversy of the event, as Japanese kickboxer Musashi took on favorite Ray Sefo. The judges decided to call the fight a draw and force an extra round, after which the judges awarded the victory to Musashi. After the fight Sefo criticized the judges harshly. In the third fight Peter Aerts took on Francois Botha which Botha won without throwing a punch: Aerts threw a series of kicks before turning away in serious pain. Doctors later diagnosed Aerts with a torn calf muscle. In the next fight defending champion Remy Bonjasky took on four time WGP champion Ernesto Hoost. The fight went into an extra round in which it appeared that Hoost had the better strategy, but in the end Bonjasky was given the win to the noticeable disgust of the usually composed Hoost. In the first semi-final Musashi took on Kaennorsing. After three rounds the majority of the judges saw it as another draw, sending the fight into an extra round in which Musashi was judged victor. Bonjasky won the other match after landing a kick that knocked the Botha down. In the third round of the final, Bonjasky vs Musashi, a missed flying high kick sent Bonjasky crashing out of the ring into the announcers table. Time had to be stopped to check on the visibly shaken Bonjasky, but he wanted to continue the fight. After the first three rounds the judges saw the fight even and forced it into an extra round. In the fourth, the fight was called a draw again. In the fifth round both fighters were tired and sloppy, but the judges finally picked Bonjasky as the winner, after fighting a record 12 rounds in one night. =2005= The 2005 K-1 season started with the emergence of the 7'2\\" former Korean Ssireum wrestler Choi Hong-man. Similar to Akebono, Choi was a celebrated fighter in his native country who decided to pursue a career in K-1. His debut was at the Asia GP where in the second round he faced Akebono and won after only 24 seconds. In the finals Choi faced last year's Asia GP winner Kaoklai Kaennorsing. On paper the match was very uneven with Kaoklai being 5'9\\" and Choi 7'2\\" but Kaennorsing took the giant to an extra 4th round. Yet Choi's size and reach advantage gave him the win from the judges. In Las Vegas, K-1 veteran Glaube Feitosa knocked out favorite Gary Goodridge in the first round. While in Paris at the Europe GP, Semmy Schilt made his return to K-1 by winning the tournament in easy fashion. Bob \\"the Beast\\" Sapp won the Japan GP quite easily. In Hawaii the Oceania GP was held and won by fan favorite Gary Goodridge who knocked out former Japan GP champion Yusuke Fujimoto. Finally the repecharge tournament held in Las Vegas was won by 21-year-old Ruslan Karaev. In the elimination event held in Osaka the GP winners along with Jerome Le Banner (selected by the K-1 heads) faced last year's final seven (Musashi, Kaoklai, Mighty Mo, Ray Sefo, Peter Aerts, Francois Botha and Ernesto Hoost). Ernesto Hoost had to back out due to injury and was replaced with Rickard Nordstrand. The first fight had Ray Sefo take on Kaoklai Kaennorsing who took the fight to a decision which Sefo won by a slim margin. Ruslan Karaev took out Nordstrand by a unanimous decision victory. Glaube Feitosa took Semmy Schilt to a decision but loss. Defending WGP champion Remy Bonjasky received a bye but still had to fight: his opponent was Alexey Ignashov. The fight went a full extra round, but Ignashov received the lost. In the other elimination fights, Le Banner beat Goodridge in the first, while Aerts took two rounds to take out Mighty Mo. Musashi won against Botha after a decision. In the main event of the night the \\"Beast\\" Bob Sapp took on the \\"Giant\\" Hong Man Choi. The fight went the distance, but the judges favored Choi and gave him the win. In the first match of the 2005 WGP, Bonjasky took on Choi and got the unanimous win. The next match was between Sefo and Schilt which Schilt won by a decision. The match between Le Banner and Aerts went to an extra round decision in which the judges thought Aerts did just enough to win. The last first round match pitted Musashi against Ruslan Karaev. The fight went to another extra round decision that saw Musashi the winner. In the first semifinal match Remy Bonjasky lost to Schilt after Schilt caught him with a knee to the gut that Bonjasky could not get up from. Before the second semi-final match it was announced that Peter Aerts could not continue due to injury, and his opponent Le Banner could not continue either. Therefore, the first reserve fighter winner Glaube Feitosa (who had defeated Gary Goodridge earlier in the night) was granted the spot in the semifinal against Musashi and, to the surprise of many, won. The final of the 2005 WGP was therefore between Schilt and Feitosa. In the end it took the \\"Hightower\\" Semmy Schilt 48 seconds to win KO Feitosa with a knee strike and win the WGP. =2006= At the start of 2006 K-1 decided to instill a major rule change and that was to discourage the usage of a clinch. For those not familiar with kickboxing, Muay Thai or even boxing, the clinch is a technique where one fighter grabs the other fighter to immobilize them. Sometimes it is used to set up a knee strike (mostly used in Muay Thai and kickboxing) other times the clinch is used when a fighter is tired, or stunned from a punch and they clinch with their opponent so that fighter cannot strike them again. Not only is it a technique but it can be VERY important strategy wise. Anyway, at the beginning of the year the K-1 heads decided to discourage the usage of the clinch in order to create more exciting fights as it seemed to many tired fighters were using the clinch way to often resulting in slowing down the pace of fights. This move upset many of the K-1 fighters as it would force them to change the way they fought, as well as upset many of the K-1 purists who do not like change. The ‚Äúno clinch‚Äù rule would affect many important fights throughout the year, and none more important than the first major fight of the year between defending K-1 WGP champion Semmy Schilt and three time WGP champion Peter Aerts. The setting was the first K-1 WGP qualifier event in Auckland, New Zealand. During the fight the smaller Aerts took the fight to the mighty Schilt and looked to actually cause the defending champion some problems. Yet what gave Schilts a bigger problem was the ‚Äúno clinch‚Äù rule as he was warned numerous times about clinching with Aerts and ultimately lost two points. The catch was that during the fight Schilt was not clinching nearly as much as his opponent Aerts, yet it seemed the referee would ignore Aerts violation of the rule and continuously cite Schilts. In the end the fight went to a decision and it came to a majority ruling in favor of Peter Aerts (with one of the judges ruling it a draw and two of the judges giving Aerts a slight advantage of 29-28). In the end those two points that Schilt's lost would have made a BIG difference in the outcome, possible even giving Schilts the win. This would not be the first controversial ruling of the year but definitely one of the big ones. During the Melbourne GP Polish Muay Thai practitioner Paul Slowinski knocked his way to the WGP by knocking out Rony Sefo, brother of K-1 vet Ray Sefo, K-1 fan favorite Peter Graham and Jason Suttie in the finals. The main event of the Melbourne GP show was a superfight between New Zealander Ray Sefo and former boxing champion Francois Botha. The fight went to a decision with all three judges ruling in favor of Sefo. The next qualifier was an exciting event in Las Vegas. K-1 and PRIDE veteran Gary Goodridge took less than two minutes to dispose of his first two opponents and make it to the finals making him an instant favorite to take the whole tourney. Yet when the dust was cleared it was actually surprising darkhorse Chalid ‚ÄòDie‚Äô Faust who qualified for the WGP after knocking out Goodridge in the third round. Ironic enough Faust lost in the semi finals of the Vegas GP to K-1 veteran Carter Williams but after the fight Williams could not continue due to injury. This allowed Faust to enter the finals and make it to the WGP. Also on the Vegas card were a few great superfights. K-1 wunderkid Ruslan Karaev defeated K-1 veteran Stefan Leko by decision in an amazing match of pure action. Former pro wrestler Slyvester ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù Terkay gave Korean giant Hong-Man Choi his toughest challenge to date and even though the fight went to a decision win for Choi many fans that attended the show believed Terkay was the real winner. The last superfight was between defending WGP champion Semmy Schilt and Japan's favorite son, MUSASHI. In the fight it was obvious to everyone that Schilt was too much for MUSASHI but to the Japanese fighter's credit he would not stay down and made the fight go to a decision. The result was a unanimous win for Schilt. The Amsterdam GP qualifier will go down as the most controversial event of 2006, maybe even in K-1 history. The night began with a super fight between K-1 veteran Jerome Le Banner and two time WGP champion Remy Bonjasky. During this fight it appeared pretty obvious to everyone that the usually light footed Bonjasky was very sluggish which the power puncher Le Banner took advantage of. After three rounds it looked to be that LeBanner was going to walk away with a victory but instead it was a unanimous decision for Bonjasky. Le Banner was shocked and even the crowd started booing the decision. After the event Le Banner filed an appeal threatening to never fight in K-1 again unless the decision was over turned. In the end the K-1 organization agreed to overturn the decision. The night of controversy continued and had a bigger impact on the actual card itself. One of the marquee matches of the night was to be the \\"retirement\\" match for 4 time WGP champion Ernesto Hoost, who hand picked his final opponent to be the \\"Beast\\" Bob Sapp. Many K-1 fans were eager for the fight and very familiar to the bad blood between these two fighters. Hours before the show even began Bob Sapp arrived to the arena very upset. Apparently for the last few months Sapp was under negotiation to renew his contract with K-1. According to Sapp K-1 organizers agreed to a new contract but kept delaying Sapp from looking at it and signing it. Sapp told them he was not going to fight until he saw and signed the contract. The K-1 heads reassured Sapp that his new contract will be at the Amsterdam show and ready to be signed before the event started. Sapp arrived to the arena but no contract was produced. He started telling K-1 heads that he would not fight until he saw the contract which the K-1 heads told him they could not do. Sapp then threatened within hours of the show starting that he would NOT fight until he saw a contract. The show began and many fans at the show confirmed seeing Sapp leave the arena in disgust, no contract was ever produced and Sapp ended his relationship with K-1. Scrambling for a new main event the K-1 heads looked to \\"Mr. K-1\\" Peter Aerts, who was to do guest commentating during the Hoost/Sapp fight, to fill in for Sapp. Aerts, being the champion that he was, took up the fight with no preparation and even had to borrow Semmy Schilt's shorts to fight in the ring. What went down was a classic albeit slow match between the two greatest men to enter the K-1 ring. Hoost was given the three-round decision but to everyone at the show both fighters gave Ernesto Hoost the perfect sendoff to the man they called \\"Mr. Perfect\\". The Amsterdam GP event was finished off of course with a GP tournament which was won by the 6' 8\\" Bjorn Bregy. Also participating in the tournament was a returning Alexey Ignashov but he faltered in the semi finals against K-1 rookie, Gokhan Saki and never regained the prominence he once held in the K-1 ranks. The 2006 Asia GP was one of the saddest GPs in a while. Most of the eight competitors did not look like they belonged in the K-1 ring. The only mentionable matchup was between Japanese fighter Tsuyoshi Nakasako and the short Thai fighter Kaoklai Kaennorsing. In the end the GP was won by former boxer turned K-1 fighter Yusuke Fujimoto. In the superfights K-1 vets Peter Aerts and Ray Sefo took out their young opponents Hiraku Hori and Ruslan Karaev, respectively by Knock outs. In the main event the battle of giants took place between Hong Man Choi and reigning WGP champion Semmy Schilt. The fight was not spectacular but Schilt's far superior kickboxing talent was able to award him a unanimous decision. Instead of the usual Japan GP in 2006 they instead decided to bring back the \\"Revenge\\" match concept that was very popular in the early K-1 days, matches that allowed a fighter to avenge a lost he suffered earlier. In the first revenge fight former WGP champion Peter Aerts took on sometime friend Gary Goodridge who was looking for revenge from their 2005 showdown where the \\"Lumberjack\\" Aerts chopped down Goodridge with some wicked leg kicks. This time around Goodridge fared better but still ended up losing a unanimous decision. Former WGP champion Remy Bonjasksy was looking for revenge against Mighty Mo who upset the young upstart in their hotly contested fight in Las Vegas. This time around the \\"Flying Gentleman\\" was able to use his quick kicks and movements to get the judges nod for the win and avenged his prior lost. The next revenge match was a rematch between the giants of K-1, Korean fighter Hong Man Choi and former Yokozuna Akebono. This would actually be the THIRD match between these two giants with Akebono losing both to Choi in the first round. This time around the Japanese superstar survived the first round but only lasted less than a minute in the second round before being knocked out. In the main event a very much demanded rematch took place between Japanese's favorite son MUSASHI and Brazilian fighter Glaube Feitosa who unceremoniously knocked MUSASHI out in the 2005 WGP Final. This time around MUSASHI fared better but still lost a unanimous decision to the Brazilian Kyokushinka. The last stop before the 2006 WGP was the repecharge tourney in Las Vegas. For the eight fighters who participated in the tourney it was their last chance for a trip to Japan and the WGP. For one fighter in particular Alexey Ignashov, this was his last chance to redeem himself and try to achieve the success that many always thought he would achieve in the K-1. In the tournament, Ignashov was paired up with American kickboxer Imani Lee. During the fight Ignashov looked sluggish and not in shape, luckily though he was able to pull out a decision from the judges. For the \\"Red Scorpion\\" Ignashov could not continue into the second round and thus his WGP dreams were dashed again. Another fighter who was looking for a second chance was Stefan Leko. For a long time Leko was always a fan favorite yet could never get past the top echelon of K-1. With his last shot at the WGP, Leko tore through the competition with KOs over Scotty Lighty and former US GP champion Carter Williams. In the finals Leko got his chance to go to Japan with another KO win over another former US GP champion Michael McDonald. As usual in the Final Elimination tournament for the WGP last year's eight finalist and the winners of the various GPs were paired up to select the final eight fighters who will participate in the WGP. Rounding out the final 16 fighters were last year's finalist Glaube Feitosa who started as a reserve fighter, \\"Mr. Perfect\\" Ernesto Hoost and \\"The Golden Boy\\" Badr Hari. Originally Peter Aerts was supposed to take part in the Final Elimination in a dream match against Remy Bonjasky but he fell with an illness. Replacing him was long time K-1 fan favorite Gary Goodridge. In the first match of the Eliminations, the future of K-1 collided in the form of Ruslan Karaev and Badr Hari. Many were eagerly anticipating this fight as it represented the true battle between opposites; the squeaky clean Karaev and the loud mouth Hari. The fight ended quickly and in controversy as Karaev knocked Hari down quickly and then accidentally kneed him in the face with what looked like an \\"illegal\\" knee. Hari refused to get up to meet the count and was thus given the lost. Hari screamed about the decision and even stated \\"he would never fight in K-1 again\\". In the next fight former K-1 WGP champion Remy Bonjasky took on Gary Goodridge in a competitive fight. Many were thinking Bonjasky would get by Goodridge easily but this fight went to the third round with Bonjasky looking a bit rusty. Finally Bonjasky caught Goodridge with a good kick to the gut and knocked him out. It took a decision for Glaube Feitosa to beat the tall Paul Slowinski while defending WGP champion Semmy Schilt easily overpowered Bjorn Bregy. In possibly the fight of the night, two long time K-1 favorites Ray Sefo and Stefan Leko went toe to toe in a brawl that went the extra round. In the end Leko barely squeaked by purely on conditioning and was given the ticket to the WGP finals. Ernesto Hoost easily took out Japan GP winner Yusuke Fujimoto with a few kicks to his leg while Chalid \\"Die Faust\\" took out MUSASHI showing that the Japanese favorite may soon be losing his touch. In the main event Jerome Le Banner started his quest to finally win a WGP by taking out the \\"Korean Giant\\" Hong Man Choi. It took everything that Le Banner had to get the win but he finally was able to walk away with the decision after an extra round. The K-1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Tokyo Final was held for the last time at the Tokio Dome. Schilt defeated Aerts by unanimous decision to win his second consecutive GP.

He came into the recording industry in an unusual way; as an MIT-trained engineer interested in music, he had designed his own recording studio in an apartment building basement to record his own music. The first Boston album was mostly recorded in this basement studio, often using devices he designed and invented himself. After the initial success of the band, he founded Scholz Research & Development, Inc. to develop and market his own inventions, many under the Rockman brand. He has been described by AllMusic as \\"a notoriously 'un-rock n' roll' figure who never enjoyed the limelight of being a performer,\\" preferring to concentrate almost exclusively on music, production, and inventing new electronic equipment. In more recent years, he has dedicated much of his money and time to charitable work.Kurutz, Steve. [ Tom Scholz] - Allmusic  Early life  Tom Scholz was born in Toledo, Ohio and raised in the suburb of Ottawa Hills. His father, Don Scholz, was a homebuilder who became wealthy from his designs of prefabricated luxury houses and founded Scholz Design, the forerunner of Scholz Homes Inc.Pakulski, Gary. \\"They used to live here: Toledo notables' childhood homes\\" - Toledo Blade - May 21, 2006Drozdowski, Ted. \\"Boston Legal\\" Boston Magazine, July 2006 As a child, Scholz studied classical piano. He also had a penchant for tinkering with everything from go-karts to model airplanes and was always building or designing. A top student and a member of the varsity basketball team, he graduated from Ottawa Hills High School in 1965. Before his musical career, Scholz received both a bachelor's degree (1969) and a master's degree (1970) in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked for Polaroid Corporation as a senior product design engineer. Scholz would then reside in Boston.  Musical success, hiatus, and return  Scholz had a keen interest in music and began recording demos in his home studio while working at Polaroid. These demos attracted the interest of Epic Records, who signed Scholz and singer Brad Delp to a recording contract. Scholz believed his demos were good enough for release as Boston's debut album, but Epic told Scholz to re-record the demos. Most of the guitar, bass, and keyboards were performed by Scholz, although other players were involved sporadically throughout the recordings. Epic did not want the album recorded entirely in Scholz's home as Scholz had intended (the label suggested using a recording studio), but most of what ended up on the album had indeed been recorded by Scholz in his basement. The album was released in 1976 and became the biggest-selling debut album by any artist up to that time. Scholz's reputed perfectionism delayed the follow-up album, Don't Look Back, for two years. When it was finally released, he was unhappy with the result, claiming that it was released under pressure from the record company. Scholz then declared he would not release any more music unless he was completely satisfied with the final product. Consequently, Boston's third album, Third Stage, did not appear until 1986. That album was certified 4x platinum, and \\"Amanda\\" reached the top of the singles chart.[ Billboard listing of all Boston songs which charted from 1976 to 1994.] Retrieved 2009-12-09. Scholz and Brad Delp were the only members of the original group to appear on the album. Scholz also started his own line of guitar effects under the name Rockman. Among the many Rockman effects available, one could reproduce the unique \\"Boston\\" guitar sound. The boxes were arranged in cabinets and played through an (analog) stereo signal path. The originals have today become collectors' items. After Brad Delp's death in March 2007, his adult children organized a concert in his memory on August 19, 2007, at the Bank of America Pavilion in Boston and invited the group to perform. Fran Cosmo was unable to sing due to a vocal injury, so Scholz invited guest singers to appear in his place, including Michael Sweet from Stryper and long time Boston fan Tommy DeCarlo who, after auditioning for Scholz, made a guest appearance on lead vocals. DeCarlo would later become the lead singer for Boston. Early Boston members Barry Goudreau and Fran Sheehan also appeared, joining Scholz on stage for the first time in over 25 years.  Personal life  Scholz has been a vegetarian for over 30 years. He set up his own charitable foundation, the DTS Charitable Foundation in 1987 to help support such causes as animal protection, providing vegetarian resources, stopping world hunger, creating homeless shelters, food banks, animal rescues and sanctuaries, and advocating for children's rights. Through his work with his foundation, he has raised millions of dollars. PETA awarded him their Compassionate Action Award in 2013.\\"PETA Honors Tom Scholz,\\" The Boston Globe, 15 October 2013. Scholz married his second wife, Kim Hart, in the Florida Keys on January 11, 2007. They live in the Boston area. From his first marriage, Scholz has one son, Jeremy, who graduated from MIT in 2005 with a degree in mechanical engineering. When asked if his son likes his music, Scholz joked, \\"I think he does, but he's such a nice kid that he would pretend he did even if he didn't.\\" At MIT, the younger Scholz made his own pedals for electric guitar and experimented with various sounds. Scholz has remarked on the relationship with Boston's various record labels that \\"The [music] business would be a good thing, except that it's dominated by drug addicts and businessmen.\\" In regard to the theme of Boston's Corporate America album, Scholz told the Sierra Club that \\"The thing that made me decide to break with previous albums and include an overtly political song was when I discovered that for the first time in American history big business owns the news media.\\" He also stated that \\"The public has been sold a bill of goods about the free market being a panacea for mankind. Turning corporations loose and letting the profit motive run amok is not a prescription for a more livable world\\".

The 'Obby 'Oss festival is a folk custom that takes place each May Day in Padstow, a coastal town in North Cornwall. It involves two separate processions making their way around the town, each containing an eponymous hobby horse known as the 'Obby 'Oss. The festival starts at midnight on May Eve when townspeople gather outside the Golden Lion Inn to sing the \\"Night Song.\\" By morning, the town has been dressed with greenery and flowers placed around the maypole. The excitement begins with the appearance of one of the 'Obby 'Osses. Male dancers cavort through the town dressed as one of two 'Obby 'Osses, the \\"Old\\" and the \\"Blue Ribbon\\" 'Obby 'Osses; as the name suggests, they are stylised kinds of horses. Prodded on by acolytes known as \\"Teasers,\\" each wears a mask and black frame-hung cape under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. Throughout the day, the two parades, led by the \\"MC\\" in his top hat and decorated stick, followed by a band of accordions and drums, then the 'Oss and the Teaser, with a host of people, the \\"Mayers\\" - all singing the \\"Morning Song.\\" ‚Äì pass along the streets of the town. Finally, late in the evening, the two 'osses meet, at the maypole, before returning to their respective stables where the crowd sings of the 'Obby 'Oss death, until its resurrection the following May Eve. During the twentieth century the existence of the festival was described by a number of folklorists who brought greater attention to it. This helped to turn the event as a popular tourist attraction and establish it as one of the most famous folk customs in Britain.  Description  The Old 'Oss party attending the 'Obby 'Oss with dozens of accordions,melodeons and drums. The festival takes place on May Day every year. It entails two separate processions that make their way around Padstow on circuits that take twelve hours to traverse. Each procession represents a different half of the town's community. Only those whose families have lived in Padstow for at least two generations are permitted to take part in the processions. Each procession contains by an 'Obby 'Oss, a hobby horse consisting of an oval frame covered in black oilskin, which has a small horse's head in the front with a snapping jaw. This is led by an individual known as the Teaser, who is dressed in white and carries a painted club. The procession also contains a retinue of white-clad individuals, some playing accordions,melodeons and drums. This retinue sings a local version of a Mayers' song. At times this tune becomes a dirge, at which the 'Obby 'Oss sinks to the ground and lies flat. When the chorus becomes triumphant again the 'Oss rises and continues along the procession.  History  = Origins = The origins of the celebrations in Padstow are unknown. There is extensive documentary evidence of British community May Day celebrations in the 16th century and earlier, although the earliest mention of the Obby 'Oss at Padstow dates from 1803. An earlier hobby horse is mentioned in the Cornish language drama Beunans Meriasek, a life of the Camborne saint, where it is associated with a troupe, or \\"companions.\\"Stokes, Whitley, ed. and tr; Hadton, Dominus (1830-1909), Beunans Meriasek.

A Cornish drama. https://archive.org/details/beunansmeriasek01hadtgoog/page/n84 There is no evidence to suggest that the 'Obby 'Oss festival is older than the eighteenth century. It has been speculated that such festivals have pre-Christian origins, such as in the Celtic festival of Beltane in the Celtic nations, and the Germanic celebrations during the √ûrimilci-m≈çna√æ (literally Three-Milking Month or Month of Three Milkings)Caput XV: De mensibus Anglorum from De mensibus Anglorum. Available online: in England.BBC ‚Äì Cornwall ‚Äì About Cornwall ‚Äì Obby Oss Day The custom attracted little attention outside of the town until 1907, when the folklorist Francis Etherington drew attention to it. In 1913 the folklorist Thurstan Peter wrote about it; influenced by the ideas of the anthropologist James Frazer, Peter argued that the 'Obby 'Oss custom might have once been a pre-Christian religious ritual designed to secure fertility. The idea that the custom had pre-Christian roots helped to convert it into a tourist attraction. This idea of the custom as a pre-Christian one percolated into the Padstow community, for when the historian Ronald Hutton visited the town in 1985 he found locals describing it to him as an ancient pagan fertility rite. In the 1950s Alan Lomax, then in London and working for the BBC, and his collaborator Peter Kennedy of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, decided to document the unique May Eve and May Day Festivals at Padstow, they selected George Pickow to be their cameraman. The result was the 16-minute colour film Oss Oss Wee Oss (1953). = Modern developments = Crowds of tourists observing the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss custom in 2006 By the 1990s, the 'Obby 'Oss festival was a major attraction that drew large numbers of visitors to Padstow. By that point, Hutton referred to it as \\"one of the most famous and most dramatic folk customs of modern Britain\\", adding that it constituted \\"a tremendous reaffirmation of communal pride and solidarity in this small and normally quiet settlement\\". The festival was not held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall- news/padstow-obby-oss-celebrations-cancelled-3963623  Celebration practice  The blue ribbon 'Oss in 2009 The celebration itself starts at midnight on 30 April with unaccompanied singing around the town starting at the Golden Lion Inn. By the morning of 1 May, the town is dressed with greenery, flowers and flags, with the focus being the maypole. The climax arrives when two groups of dancers progress through the town, one of each team wearing a stylised recreation of a 'horse.' The two 'osses are known as the \\"Old\\" and the \\"Blue Ribbon\\" 'osses. During the day a number of \\"Junior\\" or \\"colt\\" 'osses appear, operated by children. Accompanied by drums and accordions and led by acolytes known as \\"Teasers\\", each 'oss is adorned by a gruesome mask and black, oilskin cape on a circular frame under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. The Blue ribbon 'oss is apparently of more recent origin. In the late 19th century, Blue 'Oss was supported by members of the Temperance movement who were trying to discourage the consumption of alcohol associated with the \\"old\\" 'oss followers. After the first world war the imperative of temperance was lost, and the 'oss became known as the Peace 'Oss. Each 'oss has a \\"stable\\" (in the case of the Old 'Oss, the Golden Lion Inn and the Blue Ribbon 'Oss, the institute, from which they emerge at the start of the day's proceedings and retire at the end. Sometimes in the late afternoon, the 'osses may meet at the maypole and dance together. = Night Song = May Pole in Padstow, 2006 :Unite and unite and let us all unite, :For summer is acome unto day, :And whither we are going we will all unite, :In the merry morning of May. :I warn you young men everyone, :For summer is acome unto day, :To go to the green-wood and fetch your May home, :In the merry morning of May. :Arise up Mr. ..... and joy you betide, :For summer is acome unto day, :And bright is your bride that lies by your side, :In the merry morning of May. :Arise up Mrs. ..... and gold be your ring, :For summer is acome unto day, :And give to us a cup of ale the merrier we shall sing, :In the merry morning of May. :Arise up Miss ..... all in your gown of green, :For summer is acome unto day, :You are as fine a lady as wait upon the Queen, :In the merry morning of May. :Now fare you well, and we bid you all good cheer, :For summer is acome unto day, :We call once more unto your house before another year, :In the merry morning of May. = Day Song = :Unite and unite and let us all unite, :For summer is acome unto day, :And whither we are going we will all unite, :In the merry morning of May. :Arise up Mr. .....

Similar hobby horses elsewhere  The Minehead Hobby Horse in 2008 (See also: Hobby horse) 'Obby 'Oss traditions also exist in nearby Barnstaple and Combe Martin. Minehead in Somerset also has two large hobby horses, the Sailors' Horse and the Town Horse. Although more pointed or boat-shaped than the Padstow 'Osses, they are similar in that the dancer within the costume wears a tall, conical hat with a grotesque mask over their face; the horse framework is suspended from the dancer's shoulders and a long skirt hangs down to partly hide their body; the animal's heads are small and wooden with snapping jaws. They also capture bystanders. There is documentary evidence of an 'Oss at Penzance in the late 19th century, made with a caped stick and skull, which has formed the basis of the Penglaz 'Obby 'Oss that appears during the Golowan festival and the Montol Festival, both modern revivals; the skull 'oss is strikingly similar to the Mari Lwyd in Wales associated with the pre-Christian deity Rhiannon, known as Epona the horse goddess in continental Celtic cultures, passing into festive folklore as 'the Old Grey Mare' in neighbouring parts of Britain e.g. Dartmoor (Widecombe Fair), Dorset (The Grey Mare and her Colts), as well as the Soultide mummers' horses of Cheshire.Master Mummers: Antrobus Soulcakers 2008 Similar Corpus Christi (May‚ÄìJune) folk tradition exists in Galicia in Spain and Portugal where St George fights a dragon in the manner of the Cornish Mummers Plays. Tinsel-cloaked street entertainers dress similarly to the Welsh Mari Llywd but the snapping animal skull might be a goat or fox rather than horse and depicts the Coco or the Peluda. The Tarasque from Southern France The Tarasque procession from southern France has direct pre-Roman Celtic antecedents and a terrifying ancient Celtic sculpture at the Mus√©e lapidaire d'Avignon depicts the monster hoarding severed human heads (French wikipedia with images). There are some similarities between this festival and the Lajkonik hobby-horse festival in Krak√≥w, Poland. In particular the idea that young women may be captured or struck with a stick to bring them \\"luck\\" or fertility suggests a pagan, or at least medieval origin. Lajkonik is 700 years old. Rather more recent is the Banbury Hobby-Horse festival, which started in 2000, and features ritual animals from all parts of the British Isles, some old, some more modern.

It serves 1,700 students in the Manchester Public School system. History Manchester High School was founded in 1893 with Fred A. Verplanck serving as the school's first principal. The first graduating class of 1894 had a total of six students. The school was held in the Ninth District School, where Bennet Academy is located today. In 1902, the wealthy Cheney family offered to construct a new high school building to accommodate the students' needs. In 1904, the new South Manchester High School opened on Main Street. The four-story building is in the Colonial Revival architecture style, with columns, cornices, and an arched entrance; these elaborate architectural details were designed by architects Hartwell, Richardson & Driver of Boston. The building included all of the modern amenities of the time. It was dedicated in December 1904. The Town of Manchester purchased the property, and the school, from the Cheney family in 1928, when the school became Manchester High School. The yearbook, SOMANHIS (South Manchester High School), was founded in 1915. Volume 100 was released in 2015. Volume 104 is set to be released at the end of the 2018-2019 school year. In 1956, a new campus on East Middle Turnpike opened. The graduating class of 1956 was the last class to graduate from the \\"old\\" school. The new Manchester High School is much larger than the original building, and was a state-of-the-art facility when it first opened. At the time of the opening of the new high school, Manchester High School was the largest secondary school in New England. In 2015, it is the current campus of Manchester High School. Most of the classrooms, as well as the library and main office, are located in the \\"quadrangle,\\" a set of four hallways connected to make a square. The cafeteria is next to the Brookfield Street parking lot and has its own entrance and lobby. The gymnasium is next to the cafeteria, and the pool and an additional gym are nearby. Also on the campus are baseball and softball fields, a soccer/football field, and a track. Manchester High School's Bailey Auditorium in 1988, from East Middle Turnpike. The school's first renovation took place in the 1980s, with a new wing being added as well as maintenance to keep up with safety regulations. This wing now houses the Bentley Alternative Education School. In 2007, a major expansion and renovation took place with the purpose of relieving the school's congestion. The main component of the expansion, the Freshman Center (commonly referred to as the freshman wing), extends off one of the quadrangle's hallways and contains classrooms, science labs, computer labs, and a presentation room. The freshman wing is air- conditioned, unlike the rest of the school. Additional parts of the school were renovated, namely the 1100-seat Bailey Auditorium. The renovation brought a new stage, re-upholstered seats, air conditioning, and a new state-of-the- art sound system to Bailey Auditorium. The cafeteria was also expanded during the renovation, as well as the School Store and Student Activities office. The freshman wing and new auditorium and cafeteria opened for the 2007-2008 school year, with a celebratory concert held in the just-renovated Bailey Auditorium. A ribbon-cutting ceremony accompanied the opening of the freshman wing on September 4, 2007. Education Quality Manchester High School offers at least 14 Advanced Placement classes, including AP Environmental Science, AP Biology, AP Chem, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP World History, AP United States History, AP Psychology, AP European History, AP Government, AP Music Theory, AP Literature and Composition, AP Language and Composition, and AP Studio Art. Additionally, students may receive college credit through the University of Connecticut's Early College Experience (ECE) program. Manchester High School is a school that has not met the Acceptable Yearly Progress goals set by the No Child Left Behind Act. This is determined by the results of the Connecticut Academic Performance Test administered statewide to 10th grade students. The most recent data available is from 2011 and indicates that the school graduates a lower percentage of students than the state average, that only 68.3% of students are regarded as proficient at mathematics while 77.5% are regarded as reading at a proficient level. In 1983, Dr. LeRoy Hay was awarded the National Teacher of the Year award. Manchester High School aerial shot, 2014. Demographics Manchester High School is regarded under the No Child Left Behind Act as having a school poverty percentage of 46% and a school minority percentage of 49.4%. These numbers are based on the Connecticut Academic Performance Test results from 2011 and reflect the 10th grade class evaluated during that testing cycle. Sports Manchester High School offers soccer, football, cross country, swimming, wrestling, indoor and outdoor track and field, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, golf, tennis, cheerleading and hockey. MHS's main sports rivals are Glastonbury High School, East Hartford High School, South Windsor High School, and East Catholic High School. Extracurricular Activities Manchester High School has a multiple-award-winning music program. In addition to general Band, Orchestra, Chorus, or Chorale, students can choose to audition for higher- level ensembles, which include the Roundtable Singers, Marching Band, Advanced Percussion, and Chamber Orchestra. These four groups, along with the Handbell Choir, compete annually in competitions around the state and country. There is also a jazz band, jazz combo and a string quartet, among other smaller ensembles. Sock 'N Buskin, Manchester High School's oldest club, puts on several plays a year, as well as a musical in the spring. In addition to an extensive performing arts program, Manchester High School has many clubs and activities, including an award-winning robotics team, several cultural clubs, a Gay-Straight Alliance for Equality (GSAFE), and more. Manchester High School APB (Activities Planning Board), Future Business Leaders of America (Future Business Leaders of America), Family, Career and Community Leaders of America and DECA are groups focused on community and leadership. Other clubs, among others, include the Exploratory Jewelry Club and Papyrus and Quills, a creative writing club. MHS freshman center entrance in 2014. Recent Changes Since 2012, Manchester High School has gone through major changes in an attempt to improve the school and increase safety. =Swipe= Starting in 2012, Manchester High School became a \\"Swipe school,\\" meaning that students have to swipe their ID cards in a machine every morning to track attendance. Swipe cost $47,355 to implement and costs about $6,000 a year to maintain. Its purpose is to reduce the number of students skipping classes. \\"Classroom teachers will be able to identify students who come to school but do not attend classes,\\" former principal (now superintendent) Matthew Geary said. \\"Teachers also will know if a student is in the library, nurse's office and other locations equipped with swiping stations.\\" Juniors in good academic standing have the option of late arrival and early release in place of a study hall at the beginning or end of the day. Seniors in good academic standing also have the privilege of late arrival and early release; they also have the privilege of open campus, and can swipe out of the building for lunch, or if they do not have a class. =MHSRedline= In 2012, Manchester High School launched a new website, \\"MHSRedline.\\" MHSRedline was created to be a contemporary, dynamic, and mobile-friendly school website. During the school year, it is updated daily with news and school updates, and MHSRedline Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages have been created to accompany the website. =Chromebooks= At the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, Manchester High School officially became a \\"Google school,\\" and every student and staff member received a Google Chromebook. This was made possible by the Nellie Mae Grant, along with other grants. The purpose of the \\"Chromebooks in the classroom\\" initiative was to bring students into a 21st-century learning environment. The school has adapted Google Chrome as its main operating system, and the use of Chromebooks has exceeded that of desktops at Manchester High School. All work is stored virtually in the cloud, allowing access through any computer with a modern browser. Notable alumni * Elizabeth S.

The process thermally cracks the long chain hydrocarbon molecules in the residual oil feed into shorter chain molecules leaving behind the excess carbon in the form of petroleum coke. This petroleum coke can either be fuel grade (high in sulphur and metals) or anode grade (low in sulphur and metals). The raw coke from the coker is often referred to as green coke.Petroleum coke on the website of the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology In this context, \\"green\\" means unprocessed.

He was an expert on the marine arthropods known as sea spiders (Pycnogonida), and on the seashore plant and animal life of southern California. He was a spokesperson for care for the floral and faunal diversity of the California coastline. Early life Hedgpeth was born on September 29, 1911 in Oakland, California.Joel Hedgpeth, Marine Biologist and Advocate of Sea Life, Dies at 94, New York Times, August 12, 2006, p. B16. Obituary by Jeremy Pearce. He married Florence Warrens in 1944, and the couple would have two children. He obtained his PhD (on the distribution and ecology of invertebrates along the Texas and Louisiana coasts) from the University of California, Berkeley in 1952. While at Berkeley, he studied under two of the most important marine biologists of the era, S.F. Light and Ralph I. Smith. Career Hedgpeth met and corresponded with Edward F. Ricketts (1897‚Äì1948), a charismatic researcher of West Coast marine biology and the real-life model for the character \\"Doc\\" in John Steinbeck's novel, Cannery Row. Hedgpeth himself may have been the model for the character, \\"Old Jay\\" in Steinbeck's novel, Sweet Thursday [Schram and Newman 2007]. Hedgpeth later was the editor of several editions of Ricketts' \\"Between Pacific Tides,\\" a classic in marine biology, describing marine life along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. Hedgpeth edited more of Ricketts' writings in two volumes of \\"The Outer Shores.\\" His publications included the massive Volume 1 of the \\"Treatise on Maine Ecology & Paleoecology\\" (1957); and Introduction to Seashore Life of the San Francisco Bay Region (1962).Smith, Randall W. 2007. Beyond Pacific Tides: The Inner Shores. Remembering Joel Walker Hedgpeth (1911‚Äì2006). The Quarterly Review of Biology 82(2):93-96. His teaching posts included the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego. He was also director of the Pacific Marine Station, a University of the Pacific research facility at Dillon Beach, California, from 1957 to 1965. He was director of the Yaquina Biological Laboratories of the Marine Science Center, Oregon State University, Newport, Oregon, from 1965 to 1973. He retired as Professor of Oceanography in September, 1973. He and his wife moved to Santa Rosa, California during retirement. He died July 28, 2006 in Hillsboro, Oregon. His archives are housed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. The nudibranch Polycera hedgpethi was named in his honor by Ernst Marcus, a marine biologist who taught at the University of S√£o Paulo in Brazil. Hedgpeth was an iconoclast and an early environmentalist. He spoke Latin, German, Welsh, and Russian. He founded the \\"Society for the Prevention of Progress\\" and was its sole member, under a pseudonym, Jerome Tichenor (Schram and Newman 2007). Under the same pseudonym, he published \\"Poems in Contempt of Progress\\" and vocally opposed a nuclear power plant once proposed at Bodega Head, California (Carlton 2006). He was influential in the developing West Coast environmental movement in the 1970s. His influence was instrumental in getting the California freshwater shrimp, Syncaris pacifica, listed as an endangered species (Schram and Newman 2007). Publications *Hedgpeth, Joel W.

History The beginnings of the band are dated 1989, yet the idea and the name are dated five years earlier. After Ramzes & The Hooligans operation had been suspended Burak, the guitarist, decided to create new Silesian punk band. Together with Gienek - Dziobaty (vocals), Wojtek - Tic-Tac (bass guitar) and Landryn (drums) they had started rehearsals. In 1991 the first concert took place, connected with clashes with locals. Iglak, at this time band's supporter took place in this event. In this time the band played mostly covers of 77 punk classics. In spring 1993 few changes were made in band's line up. Ada≈õ had changed Landryn on drums and Biker had taken vocals over, but those two soon left the band and Burak and Tic-Tac stayed as the only members. Due to that fact the band suspended operation for a while. Soon after Szpajza took the position of drummer and Iglak started as a vocalist. The first concert in this line up took place in 1997 in Jastrzƒôbie Zdr√≥j. The band decided to give up covers and start playing own songs with lyrics written mainly by Iglak. Another change in personnel was change of drummer for ≈Åikend, who had played for the whole year after he was changed once again for Ada≈õ. Year 2000 brought recording of the band's debut album. Out of 17 songs recorded only 14 reached the final material. Soon after the record had been recorded, Tic-Tac left Poland, and from then on he only supported the band occasionally. During his absence Darek - Zielony and Sylwek Sƒôk exchanged for him. In May 2001, Pawe≈Ç - Gruby took the bass player position. The band started working on the second album. In 2002, Bulbulators gave several successful concerts supporting The Exploited, Angelic Upstarts and The Business. Next year Ada≈õ left the band going to Italy, passing his position on Jacek Nynek. Preparations to record third album started in 2003. Meanwhile, the band was invited to record a song on an album Jest Dezerter - Nie ma zagro≈ºenia. Before the concert in Slovakia in 2004 Nynek disappeared. Zyga became \\"emergency\\" drummer this time. The new drummer was Sensitive Rat, who had played in Bulbulators as Szpajza. The same year, during one of concerts Zygzak from once famous Polish band TZN Xenna appeared as a guest of Bulbulators. Later Zygzak would take part in recording several songs on the band's third album. In January 2005, the third album was released, not only containing song performed by Zygzak, but also several songs with wider instruments use (acoustic guitar, piano, trumpet).

Chapin is located at the intersection of Dyer Street and Ellerthorpe Avenue on land reserved for the United States Government and is a part of the El Paso Independent School District. It is the only high school in the continental United States that is on government property but not owned by the government.Only 4 secondary schools are run by DoD in the continental US. -- Elisabeth Bumiller (25 December 2012) \\"With a Parent Off Again at War, a Holiday of Pride and Isolation\\", The New York Times, pp A1, A12. Of the over two dozen high schools operated by the US Department of Defense Education Activity (dodea), only 4 high schools in the Continental US are operated by the DODEA; all 4 are east of the Mississippi River. accessdate=2012-12-25 The school enrolls approximately 1,900 students in grades 9 to 12. Nearly half the students are military dependents from the nearby Fort Bliss installation. The school also accepts students from throughout the city of El Paso as part of the school's pre-engineering magnet program.El Paso County in Texas. Catchment area Much of Fort Bliss is zoned to Chapin, including the western half of the main post, the Logan area around Ellerthorpe Avenue in which the Chapin campus is located and the residential areas around William Beaumont Army Medical Center. The eastern and southern portions of the main post and Biggs Army Air Field are zoned to Austin High. The Chapin attendance zone also includes several inner Central El Paso neighborhoods immediately northeast and southeast of William Beaumont Army Medical Center. These include the Upper Copia neighborhood (also known as Lower Dyer) along Dyer Street from Pierce Avenue north to Hayes Avenue to the southeast of the hospital; adjacent military housing areas between Hayes Avenue and Fred Wilson Boulevard; and the Skyline Acres West, Park Foothills and Mountain Park neighborhoods lying on the eastern slopes of the Franklin Mountains and along the western ends of Hercules, Hondo Pass and Titanic Avenues to the north of the Chapin campus. Chapin's feeder middle schools include Bassett Middle and Canyon Hills Middle. The Fort Bliss residential areas zoned to Chapin for the high-school grades are zoned to Bassett Middle for the middle-school grades. Elementary schools in the Chapin feeder pattern include Bliss, Burnet, Logan, Park, Powell and Travis. Bliss, Logan, and Powell are located on the base and Travis, while located just off post in the Lower Dyer neighborhood, largely serves the residential areas around William Beaumont Army Medical Center.http://www.episd.org Growth and expansion With the growth of Fort Bliss and the troop influx Chapin High School has experienced a large increase in student enrollment. Overcrowding and lack of additional classrooms was addressed in the 2007 EPISD Bond Program in which 12 classrooms were approved to be added to the campus to alleviate overcrowding. Chapin currently has 17 portables, numerous \\"floating\\" teachers and a need for additional science labs. Once the new addition that was started in February 2010 is complete the issue will be addressed. The new addition is located by the gym entrance and tennis courts and it is expected to be two stories tall with the capability of being expanded onto in later years. History of Capt. John L. Chapin Chapin High was named after a local World War II hero, Army Captain John L. Chapin. Before enlisting in the National Guard Chapin graduated from Texas A&M; University with a degree in chemical engineering. He intended to go to medical school after graduating but postponed his plans so that he could join the National Guard. In November 1940 Chapin's unit was activated as Company E, 141st Infantry, 36th Division of the United States Army. The unit was sent overseas to North Africa. Chapin declined several promotions in order to stay with Company E as the unit consisted mostly of fellow El Pasoans. Most Company E men were Hispanic and non-English speakers. Chapin thought that if he took the promotion Company E would probably be left to a non Spanish speaking commander who would mistreat the soldiers. For this reason his men respected him. Captain Chapin was killed leading the men of Company E into battle across the Rapido River in Italy. Chapin pre-engineering magnet program Chapin Magnet offers a specific set of classes that specialize in Engineering. There are five engineering courses offered at Chapin and only those who meet requirements and enroll before high school can attend these classes. This specialized school allows students from all over El Paso to attend Chapin and take these courses hence the term \\"magnet\\". Students are required to take Advanced Placement maths and science courses, as well as the five engineering classes. Upon completion of each course students may pay a fee to get credits towards college. At graduation all engineering students who have passed all five classes receive engineering honors and special cords to wear. Academics Chapin has consistently met and maintained state and national testing standards and is one of the few high schools to not be in the Priority Schools Division of EPISD. Chapin offers multiple Advanced Placement (AP) and Dual Credit courses and it is also one of three schools in the EPISD to offer statewide dual credit courses via the Texas Virtual School Network. Beginning with the 2009‚Äì2010 school year Chapin began offering AP Art History and Music Theory through the distance learning classroom to other district high schools. Chapin offers AP courses in: English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, World History, US History, US Government, Macroeconomics, Psychology, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Art History, Studio Art, Music Theory, Statistics, and Calculus. The following dual credit classes are offered through EPISD's partnership with the El Paso Community College (EPCC): English IV, Geology, Chemistry, and US History. Students are eligible to participate in the EPCC dual credit program granted they meet all EPCC requirements and pass the subject area ACCUPLACER test for the course they wish to take. Dual credit US Government and Psychology are offered via the TxVSN. Chapin Football The Chapin football team competes in the Texas 1 ‚Äì 4A District. The first varsity team for the school began in 2002. That first season the team finished with 6 wins and 4 losses and missed the playoffs. From its second year up to the present time the Chapin football program has had an outstanding record gaining a perfect 10-0 in season 2 in 2003 and again in 2006. The team has not missed the playoffs since that first season. From 2002 through 2008 they have an 81.4% regular season win percentage (57 wins, 13 losses), 86% District record (43 wins, 7 losses) and 45.4% playoff Record (5 wins, 6 losses). Overall the Chapin Huskies have a 76.5% winning percentage (62‚Äì19) including playoffs. Daren Walker was the head football coach for Chapin from 2002‚Äì2006 (5 seasons) and guided the team to a 47‚Äì12 record including the playoffs. Coach Walker left after the 2006 season and took over at Franklin High School in El Paso.

The salt is dissolved in the water in the crude oil, not in the crude oil itself. The desalting is usually the first process in crude oil refining. The salt content after the desalter is usually measured in PTB - pounds of salt per thousand barrels of crude oil. Another specification is Basic sediment and water The term desalter may also refer to a water desalination facility used to treat brackish water from agricultural runoff. This may be done either to produce potable water for human or animal consumption, or to reduce the salinity of river water prior to its crossing an international border, usually to comply with the terms of a treaty. Desalters are also used to treat groundwater reservoirs in areas impacted by cattle feedlots and dairies. Desalting crude oil The salts that are most frequently present in crude oil are calcium, sodium and magnesium chlorides. If these compounds are not removed from the oil several problems arise in the refining process. The high temperatures that occur downstream in the process could cause water hydrolysis, which in turn allows the formation of corrosive hydrochloric acid. Sand, silts and salt cause deposits and foul heat exchangers or result in plugging. The need to supply heat to vaporize water reduces crude pre-heat capacity. Sodium, arsenic and other metals can poison catalysts. By removing the suspended solids, they are not carried into the burner and eventually flue gas, where they would cause problems with environmental compliance such as flue gas opacity norms. Crude oil to be desalted is heated to a temperature of 100-150 ¬∞C and mixed with 4-10% fresh water, which dilutes the salt. The mixture is then pumped into a settling tank where the salt water separates from the oil and is drawn off. An electrostatic field is applied by electrodes in the settling tank, inducing polarization of the water droplets floating in the larger volume of oil. This results in the water droplets clumping together and settling to the bottom of the tank. https://m.tau.ac.il/~tsirel/dump/Static/knowino.org/wiki/Crude_oil_desalter.html Crude oil desalter References See also * Brackish water * Water desalination External links *Desalting in refinery *Desalting theory *Desalter animation Category:Industrial equipment Category:Chemical equipment Category:Oil refineries ","title":"Desalter"},{"id":"6634091","text":"Charles Shoebridge (born 1961) is a writer, broadcaster, and Russia Today commentator on security, intelligence, terrorism, and crime issues.

He was also known as The Great Vance, and Alfred Grenville. Early life  Vance was born in London in 1839. He worked initially as a solicitor's clerk before appearing in music halls. Career His first solo appearance was at the South London Palace in 1864. He had earlier performed in a blackface act with his brother in 1860. His act, initially as a Cockney singer, evolved into comedy. Throughout the 1860s Vance, along with contemporaries Arthur Lloyd and George Leybourne, was instrumental in developing a new style of music hall performer known as the lion comique or swells. In this style, performers relied less on copying burlesque, and instead sought inspiration in their everyday experiences and the colourful characters of daily street life. Audiences loved to join in the chorus and \\"give the bird\\".Banham, M., The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 768 Vance was a great rival of George Leybourne, writer of \\"Champagne Charlie\\". Vance wrote and performed \\"Cliquot\\" in response, and eventually ended the feud with the song \\"Beautiful Beer\\". His popular song \\"Walking in the Zoo\\" has been cited by Desmond Morris (in Gestures: Their Origin and Distribution) as the earliest known use in the UK of the term \\"O.K.\\" in its current sense. (It was previously used in America as a political slogan for Martin Van Buren, who was nicknamed Old Kinderhook or O.K.) The chorus of Vance's song begins with the line \\"Walking in the zoo is the O.K. thing to do.\\" It is also one of the first uses of the term \\"zoo\\" in place of the full name of \\"zoological garden\\"., Webpage for WYNC's Radiolab podcast on Zoos. The song refers specifically to the Zoological Gardens at Regent's Park, London. Another song of the 1860s was \\"The King of Trumps\\". The cover depicts a playing card for the King of Trumps in colour with parts of other cards in each corner, around a picture of Alfred Vance in a top hat. Vance died on 26 December 1888 while performing on the stage of the Sun Music Hall, Knightsbridge. He is buried in Nunhead Cemetery, although his headstone no longer exists.

Writing in The Cornishman newspaper (14 October 1880), a reporter described him as a broad, not to say vulgar singer who should not be allowed to dispense to the people such songs as the London Music Halls encourage; and suggested that, > The feelings of well-disposed and peaceful citizens are outraged by the so- > called improvised songs or topical allusions of this very low comedian. > Respectable people are held up to ridicule. The writer, further suggested that if Vance, a broad and vulgar singer/comedian, should choose to tour Cornwall again, the citizens of Falmouth should follow the example of Redruth and Liskeard, and make his visit a far from pleasant one.

He made recordings with Ray Noble's and Roy Fox's orchestras. In 1949, Noble's 1931 recording was reissued with Al Bowlly's original vocal replaced by a dubbed-in vocal trio and the record reached No. 19 in the Billboard charts. A recording by Eddie Fisher with Hugo Winterhalter and his orchestra was made at Manhattan Center, New York City, on July 18, 1952. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-4953 (in USA) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10362\\\\. It was a hit in the US, reaching the No. 6 position in the Billboard charts. Les Paul's guitar instrumental on Capitol Records also reached the Billboard charts with a peak position of No. 8. The song was also covered by Bing Crosby and Mario Lanza on their radio shows. The song is often played on the accordion. Starting in 1947, Dick Contino popularized the song in a Horace Heidt‚ÄìPhilip Morris series of talent contests. This was the theme song of Myron Floren, the accordionist on The Lawrence Welk Show. Accordionist and composer William Schimmel performs his own concert version (Reality) of Lady of Spain with a series of far-fetched variations on his solo CD Lady of Spain and Other Realities (Newport Classic Records). Popular culture The song was also featured in the TV version of Jeeves and Wooster as one of the few songs that the band that some of the members of the Drones Club actually know. They went on to perform this in several locations as black faced minstrels; in one scene, Hugh Laurie (as Bertie Wooster, hiding from the father of an erstwhile fianc√©e), performed as their vocalist. In his novel Gravity's Rainbow, Thomas Pynchon references the song. It is mentioned briefly in the description of a party being held by Lieutenant Slothrop. In the season 3 episode of I Love Lucy titled \\"Ricky's 'Life' Story\\" (1953), \\"Lady of Spain\\" is sung by Ricky Ricardo (played by Desi Arnaz). The song was also featured in the 1977 film Slap Shot, where player/coach Reggie Dunlop (played by Paul Newman) tears up the organist's music and tells him \\"Don't ever play 'Lady Of Spain' again!\\". This line is still popular today in several teams' arenas, where the fans will respond with Newman's line if \\"Lady Of Spain\\" is played during the game. \\"Lady of Spain\\" was performed by Marvin Suggs on his Muppaphone on The Muppet Show and appears on the Muppet Show 25th anniversary compilation The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More. In popular British Sitcom 'Allo 'Allo, in episode \\"All in Disgeese\\", M Alfonse plays \\"Lady of Spain\\" on accordion.

They play in Division 1 of the Munster Junior League. Clonakilty Rugby Club as it is now was formed in 1977 at a meeting in the Kilty Stone Tavern which has remained the spiritual home of the club ever since. The main reason at that time for the reformation of the club was to provide a social outlet for those involved. Rugby had been played for periods previously in the town. In 1890 a Clonakilty side competed in the Munster Senior Cup for the first time. The club played their games in The Showgrounds but disbanded in the early 1900s. Clonakilty RFC took the field again in the 1930s when Paul Blewitt, father of former Hon. Sec. Jimmy Blewitt was a stalwart player and administrator. The club disbanded again before the Second World War and was not heard of again until that fateful evening in the Kilty Stone Tavern in 1977. Clonakilty RFC is located in a small town of approximately 4.000 inhabitants; this is remarkable in that most of the principal clubs come out of Cork (120,000) and Limerick (90,000). The club commenced competitive rugby at Minor A level and won its first trophy, the Dromleena Cup in 1978. Following victories in 1980 and 1982 in the Minor A league it was decided to move up to Junior grade in 1982/83. The O'Neill Cup was won in the 1995/96 season (against Bandon in the final) and the Junior 1 team won promotion to the 1st Division as well as winning two local cups and the annual \\"Jimmy Blewitt Memorial Cup\\" played between Clonakilty and Donaghadee. In 2001, Clonakilty reached the top of Munster regional rugby and obtained promotion through a round-robin league by winning over champion sides of the three other provinces. Since then, the club won the title of the Senior Third Division in 2006. Promoted to Senior second division, and obtained a brilliant third place the following season in the Second Division places. In the following five years a number of trophies were won, bringing the club to new heights, and drawing large crowds on regular occasions. However these great times were to come to an end, when in 2013 Clon were relegated back to junior status for the first time in nine years. The club had struggled all season long, with the countrywide recession hitting the town hard, forcing a number of players to move abroad, including star centre Darragh Lynch. Many other players, overseas signings had to leave, resulting in a sudden drop in numbers in the adult squad. The club are extremely lucky therefore, to have such a fantastic underage setup. In 2013 the Under 17s triumphed in The Munster league, and then the same team almost repeated the feat a year later. With a number of that squad currently playing underage rugby with Munster and some even Ireland, there is a strong sense within the club that good times are sure to come again soon, and the onus is now on some of the up-and-coming young men to help Clon climb back up the National Leagues ladder. Clonakilty Rugby Football Club: playing in the Division 1 of the Junior League. Catering for 3 men's adult teams and under 20's, 2 ladies' teams and the full range of underage teams from under 8's to under 18's. Clon RFC have state of the art facilities with a gymnasium.

IRCA offers certification programmes that recognise the competence of auditors who audit quality, software development, aerospace, maritime safety, pharmaceutical, food safety, environmental, information security, information technology service, occupational health and safety, social systems and business continuity management systems. History The CQI's roots date back to the early days of engineering inspection during the First World War. After frequent accidental detonations in munitions factories, the UK government created the Ministry of Munitions, which placed inspectors in factories to ensure procedures were being followed correctly. In 1919, the institute was first known as the Technical Inspection Association when it attended a conference held by Woolwich Royal Arsenal's Inspection Department in London. The institute began with 500 members and was originally headquartered at its secretary's office at 44 Bedford Row, London WC1. On 10 November 1922 the TIA reformed as the Institution of Engineering Inspection, so that it could be open to industrial inspectors and inspectors employed by the UK government. In 1929, the institute's branch network was formed, with local groups meeting all over the UK. Throughout the 1930s, the profession developed further with the discovery of statistical quality control and in the 1940s the progression to 'quality control' rather than simple inspection. In March 1944, one member expressed concern at the loose way in which the term 'quality control' was being used. He then went on to propose that the IEI should be renamed 'The Institution of Quality Engineering', but this proposal met with opposition and was dropped. In 1954 the British Productivity Council proposed either the formation of a Society for Quality Control, or that quality control should be incorporated as a branch of an existing society. The institute's council agreed that it would be prepared to incorporate quality control and agreed that those interested in quality might be allowed to join the institute. On 22 December 1955, an extraordinary general meeting approved changes to the constitution, so it effectively admitted quality control as a partner with engineering inspection. Its title remained the Institution of Engineering Inspection, but its objectives included: 'To promote and encourage the practice of engineering inspection and quality control in industry. The institute began to consider offering professional qualifications in 1958. By autumn of 1960, the institute had formed an education committee and offered technical colleges a lecture entitled 'the place and function of the inspector in engineering'. Examinations started in the summer of 1960 with nine candidates. This number increased to 21 in 1961, and by 1963, it had reached 106. In 1965, the institute had completely revised and relaunched its whole examination structure. In a profession in which the majority had, in the past, acquired their knowledge and skill by experience on the job, it had taken some years to raise the examination to the academic standards then set by the institute. In 1965 the institute decided that a change in name was desirable on the basis that the institute was concerned with the much wider spectrum of quality assurance and many people working in quality were not engineers. After seeking the opinion of the branches, the council gave its approval by 17 votes to 0, but the Board of Trade was unable to accept the proposed name of the Institution of Quality Technology. It was not until 1972 that the institute was able to get general agreement and changed its name to the title Institute of Quality Assurance. This choice was reinforced by a glossary of terms, newly issued by the British Standards Institution, which defined quality assurance as 'all activities and functions concerned with the attainment of quality'. Throughout the 1970s the institute worked with the Ministry of Defence and industry to try and establishing a common approval system for quality and giving certificates of competence to successful companies. By 1980 the institute had a membership of 5,400 members which doubled by the end of the decade. Early on in the 1980s the institute merged with the National Council for Quality and Reliability and in 1981 the IQA formed a corporate bodies arm with the British Quality Association. In 1988 the IQA launched it first diplomas in quality assurance to increase the status of the quality profession and improve accessibility to quality skills. The next year the institute celebrated the first World Quality Day on 11 November and the institute's international membership was boosted by the development of a Singapore branch. The 1990s saw the BQA break away from the IQA to form the British Quality Foundation. This was a result of the Henderson Committee report which recommended a prestigious quality award for industry in the UK, following the success of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the US. The BQA was seen as the natural candidate to run the award, but felt it was not well placed to do so due to its ties to the IQA. At the end of 1992 the BQA was wound up and the BQF started as an independent organisation. The Hong Kong Branch of the IQA/CQI was established in 1991 with the assistance of the Industry Department of the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency. The 2000s brought substantial changes within the institute, with changes to the membership criteria, the launch of the Small Business Standard and the petition to the Privy Council for chartered status. In September 2006 the IQA was finally awarded a Royal Charter and commenced operating as the Chartered Quality Institute on 1 January 2007. Individual chartered status followed in 2008 and there are now more than 4,700 Chartered Quality Professionals working in the UK and beyond. Existing Members and Fellows commit to undertaking Continuous Professional Development to ensure currency of their skills and knowledge. The grade uses the post-nominal letters as CQP MCQI or CQP FCQI. The CQI was also a founder member of the European Organization for Quality, although it resigned from its membership in 2009.

History The organisation was created on 1 January 1963 by the Transport Act 1962 and replaced the London Transport Executive (LTE) upon the dissolution of the British Transport Commission. It was an independent statutory undertaking reporting directly to the Minister of Transport, whose responsibilities were similar to those of the LTE, but with the addition of some railway lines previously the responsibility of British Railways. The first Chairman was A.B.B. Valentine, who had been the Chairman of the LTE. The London Transport Board was responsible for the London Underground and for bus and coach services within the London Passenger Transport Area, an area with a radius of about 30 miles from Charing Cross established when the London Passenger Transport Board was formed in 1933. Service were generally maintained and not cut as elsewhere in the country, as train services were under the Beeching Axe. The board was responsible for the Bus Reshaping Plan in 1966, a comprehensive programme of changes to bus services. By 1970 the roads in London had become so congested that the Greater London Development Plan included in its scope policy to reduce dependence on the car. On 1 January 1970 responsibility for public transport within Greater London passed to the Greater London Council (GLC) under the Transport (London) Act 1969, with the London Transport brand retained by the GLC.

His constantly evolving oeuvre is characterized by an interesting mix of philosophical, political, and conceptual network-related issues on the one hand, and an innovative feeling for contemporary urban and underground aesthetics on the other. One of the pioneers of net.art, ƒÜosiƒá became deeply interested in ASCII code during a long period of research (1996‚Äì2001) on low- tech aesthetics, the economy, ecology and archaeology of the media, on the intersections between text and computer code, on the use of spaces in information, its fluid nature and infinite convertibility. Out of this came History of Art for the Blind, ASCII Unreal (an art game), ASCII Camera, ASCII Architecture, Deep ASCII and ASCII History of Moving Images, a history of the cinema converted into text format. He is a co-founder of Nettime, Syndicate, 7-11, and Ljubljana Digital Media Lab. The most notable venues, among many others, include Videotage, Hong Kong; Media Artlab, Tel Aviv; Venice Biennial; MIT Medialab; Walker Center, Minneapolis; Postmasters, NYC; Kunsthalle, Vienna; LAMoCA, Los Angeles; ICA, London and Beaubourg, Paris. Art ƒÜosiƒá uses ASCII characters (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) to form images or videos. He created his own software to convert the pixels from still and moving images into ASCII, and he has also experimented with audio and camera movement being transcribed through ASCII. Short sentences or paragraphs relevant to his work are often briefly summarized through few fragments of text in ASCII form. ƒÜosiƒá has put together a retrospective of some of his net.art, including various images from History of Art For Airports. ƒÜosiƒá borrowed both iconic and lesser known images, reducing them to resemble the kind of pictograms found on lavatory doors. The sources of many of the images are instantly recognizable, such as C√©zanne's Card Players and Warhol's Campbell's Soup. Some of his more notable works were made from scenes from classic films including ASCII History of Moving Images in 1999, portraying a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. Another depicting a scene from the pornographic movie Deep Throat, remade as Deep ASCII. ƒÜosiƒá had made a series of short animated sequences form various films and TV series going from Star Trek to King Kong, while in addition, constructing photographs of classical art such as Venus,Lascaux, and more. The major focus into classical mediums indicates ƒÜosiƒá's possible interest in the historical aspects of art. Tribe, Mark. New Media Art. p. 38. The show also includes a new work, File Extinguisher, which ƒÜosiƒá describes as \\"a project that fixes the web by providing the surfer with a totally free file deleting service.

They were among the first 1980s garage rock bands to incorporate overt blues influences. The band features Mick Collins (of The Dirtbombs), Dan Kroha (later of the now defunct The Demolition Doll Rods) on guitar and vocals, and Peggy O'Neill on drums. While the band originally broke up in 1992 after a European tour. The band reformed in July 2009 for a reunion tour across Europe, along with co-headliners The Oblivians. The band reconvened for a second reunion tour in 2010, this time across North America. History The Gories were formed in 1986 by metro-Detroit natives Mick Collins, Dan Kroha, and Peggy O'Neill. The Gories took their name from a band that appeared on the 1960s television show Gidget. The band members, who at that time dressed in mod clothing, were friends for over a year before they decided to start the band. At the time they formed the Gories, only Collins had had any musical experience, and they had to teach themselves how to play. The Gories released their first album, Houserockin', in 1989. The release had been pre-dated by two songs on a Wanghead compilation LP, It Came From The Garage Vol. II. The band recorded the follow-up LP, I Know You Fine, but How You Doin', in 1990, produced by Alex Chilton. They soon signed to the German label Crypt Records and released Outta Here. After three albums, the band suffered a break-up in 1992. Mick Collins went on to form various bands including Blacktop (band) and The Dirtbombs, while Dan Kroha joined Rocket 455 and later formed the Demolition Doll Rods and The Readies. Peggy O'Neill went on to join '68 Comeback and Darkest Hours. Reunion On September 30, 2008, via the Goner Records message board, Greg Cartwright of the Oblivians announced that the Gories and the Oblivians would play reunion shows in Detroit and Memphis, as well as multiple shows across Europe in the summer of 2009. The Detroit Free Press reported the reunion on April 1, 2009. The Metro Times ran a cover story on The Gories in its June 24, 2009, issue.

They have a second location at the Fredericton International Airport (YFC) in Lincoln, NB. In a year, MFC has the capacity to train 450 students between the Moncton and Fredericton Campus. Currently the Moncton Campus offers domestic and international programs with a 260-student capacity and a staff of 55. The Fredericton campus is primarily for Chinese student training with some modular based flight training and has a capacity of 190 students and employs 70 people. Both of the campuses have on-site kitchens and residences. MFC is the largest private flight school in Canada. It is also one of six, out of 150 schools in Canada, to be given integrated status. The college has trained over 20,000 pilots from approximately 70 countries since 1929. MFC has an approved FTU, ATO and AMO from Transport Canada and also has CAAC (China) approval. History The official organizational date of the Moncton Flying Club coincides with the date of the first Air Pageant, held July 1, 1929, to raise money for the airport. A group of citizens had decided that Moncton should be an air center of the Maritimes. The site for the first airport in Moncton was chosen, and work was started in April 1929. However, hard times followed shortly after the airport was complete with the onset of the Great Depression, and all flight activity virtually ceased. It was not until the late 1930s that flight training began again at the Moncton Flying Club. By the end of 1939, the Flying Club was officially incorporated and had a fleet of two privately owned planes. Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939 and the Moncton Flying Club was given the opportunity to run the \\"Elementary Flying Training School, Royal Canadian Air Force,\\" (#21 E.F.T.S., R.C.A.F.) newly opened in Chatham, New Brunswick. Training got started at the school in early July 1941, immediately after the first intake of airmen. The Fleet Finch biplane used by the school was a hardy machine with a five-cylinder engine and fabric-covered wings and fuselage. By 1945, Moncton Flying Club was operating three Elementary Flying Training Schools across Canada. A Fairchild Cornell, one of MFC's main training aircraft during the 1950s By the 1950s, the Moncton Flying Club had acquired a considerable fleet of aircraft, including four or five Tiger Moths, two Fairchild Cornells, three Aeroncas, and a Cessna T50. Despite tough economic times, membership numbers increased and the Club's notoriety grew. When an allocation of Air Cadets arrived for training, a dormitory and canteen were set up on the premises. In 1949, night flying was added to the curriculum, despite the lack of radar equipment. The Club even put together an air show, the first of many to come, with Harvards and Sea Furies competing and a stunt pilot from Quebec City participating. The school grew quickly in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and in 1961 the Flying Club was awarded its first Yorath Trophy, symbolic of Canada's top Flying Club. In 1962 the Club took over operation of Atlantic Central Airlines, which consisted of a twin Apache and amphibious Cessna 180. These additions complimented the Club's single engine charter service and enabled it to conduct twin engine training. June 12, 1965 marked a black day in the club's history, the historic hangar was destroyed in a devastating fire. However, those involved with the Club were determined to rebuild the premises, and on October 8, 1966 the new hangar and dormitory was officially opened. By the mid-1970s, students were joining from almost every country in Europe and Asia. An eight bay \\"T\\" hangar was built during 1974‚Äì75, and were used by private owners and the club's aircraft. In the 1980s, MFC changed its marketing name to \\"Moncton Flight Centre\\". For a time a fleet of Piper Navajo aircraft were operated for charters and light parcel express, initially under the name \\"Hummingbirds\\" and eventually \\"Eastwind Flights\\". In the fall of 1989, the Board of Directors chose to focus on flight training and the assets of Eastwind were sold. In more recent times the college had been growing quicker than ever, becoming the largest in Canada. In 2006 the school was awarded the largest pilot training contract ever in Canada, to train 800 Chinese pilots. The college announced in 2007 it would soon open a new campus in Fredericton to handle the quickly increasing student population. MFC had also recently signed an agreement with Mount Allison University to offer a bachelor's degree in Aviation. In 1997, under the direction of Brad Mundle, a two-year Diploma in Aviation Technology was created and the organization changed its name to the Moncton Flight College. In the spring of 1998, Mike Doiron resigned from Transport Canada and arrived at MFC to become the new CEO and Principal. Mr. Doiron developed various programs for target markets such as China and Europe. He also focused considerable attention to improving MFC's curriculum and safety standards. In 2006, MFC received approval from the Civil Aviation Authority of China to train Airline cadets. The College then signed then the largest commercial training contract in Canadian history with the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics which lead to rapid growth. In 2007, as the Moncton campus reached its capacity, a second campus opened in Fredericton in partnership with CANLink Aviation (CLA). MFC was eventually acquired by CLA in April, 2011. In December 2011, the Fredericton Campus (CYFC) began operating at full capacity to offer services to the incoming Chinese students as demand for flight training grew. As of May 2014, a portion of the new Chinese classes have been operating out of the Moncton Campus, which made both campuses operate at full capacity. Location MFC is located in New Brunswick, Canada. With one campus in Moncton and another in Fredericton, both campuses benefit from efficient airport infrastructure and low commercial flight activity. There are 21 combined training areas in Moncton for local training: all within five minutes flying time from the airport. Because of its location, pilots allegedly benefit from four-season training, and are better equipped to safely manage different weather conditions. There is a wide geographical variety including coastal, flat and mountainous.

Jan van Riebeeck called this softly undulating country between the mountain ranges \\"Het Zwarte Land\\" (the Black Land) because of the endemic Renosterbos (Elytropappus rhinocerotis). After the rains, mainly in winter, the Renosterbos takes on a dark appearance when viewed from the distance in large numbers. This is due to the fine leaf- hairs adhering to the leaves when wet. The wide fertile plain is the bread basket of Cape Town with its wheat fields reaching up to the foot of the mountains, interrupted by wine, fruit, and vegetable farms. Viticulture in the Swartland is still comparatively young but a growing number of focused producers have moved here, resulting in the region rising in popularity in the last decade to become one of the most fashionable wine areas in South Africa. Viticulture is commonly practised under dryland conditions, with minimal irrigation, which is also made possible by the large number of hectares of old vines that grow here and require less maintenance. On the Swartland Wine Route, wine farms may be visited and their products sampled, and there are regular events through the year to promote the region and its wineries. The Swartland is also home to the oldest colonial hotel of South Africa, the Royal Hotel in Riebeek Kasteel.

The route's eastern terminus is at a boat launch on the Currituck Sound. Prior to 2002, NC 136's current alignment was known as NC 3. In 2002, the numbering of this road and of what was then NC 136 which was located in Iredell and Cabarrus counties swapped to place NC 3 near the home of Dale Earnhardt, a deceased NASCAR driver from Kannapolis who drove the #3 car. Route description NC 136 begins at an intersection with US 158, heading east on two-lane undivided Macedonia Church Road. The road heads through wooded areas with some farm fields and homes. The highway turns north onto Poplar Branch Road and heads through the residential community of Poplar Branch, curving to the northeast. NC 136 runs through more woodland with some homes before coming to a dead end at a boat launch on the Currituck Sound. History In 1934, NC 3 was signed as a short route on Buck Island traveling from U.S. Highway 158 to the Currituck Sound in Currituck County.NCRoads Annex - NC 3 In 2002, state legislation was passed to swap NC 3 and NC 136\\\\.

This would not only create a good image of the police in young minds, but also channel the adolescent fascination with authority in a positive and productive manner. Thus, Vijayan launched a Student Police Cadet Project in August 2010 in 127 schools across Kerala, with 11176 students - both boys and girls - enrolled as Cadets (G.O (P) No 121/2010/Home dtd 29-05-2010). The project has now been expanded to a statewide network of 433 schools with a combined strength of nearly 35,000 SPCs, being trained by over 850 existing teachers and nearly 1500 officers of Kerala Police. This programme is planned for expansion throughout India. As Kozhikode City Police Commissioner, Vijayan initiated the Our Responsibility to Children (ORC) project to address the increasing socially deviant behaviour among adolescents. The success of the project prompted Government of Kerala to take it up in all districts, under the aegis of the Kerala Social Security Mission. Vijayan is also founder of the Police Youth Football Academy, a football programme for youth at Thrissur.http://archive.asianage.com/football/police-football-academy- kicks-374 He then founded a similar academy at Thiruvananthapuram.

Stories set in a shared universe Those 2000 AD stories which occupy a shared universe and have crossed over with each other include: *ABC Warriors *Durham Red *Flesh *Harlem Heroes *Invasion! *Judge Dredd *Nemesis the Warlock *Robo Hunter *Ro- Busters *Rogue Trooper *Mercy Heights *Strontium Dog *Young Middenface Connections between stories Series can be linked to each other in either of two ways: crossovers and spin-offs. There are also combinations of both. =Crossovers= Firstly, series which were completely independent of each other when they were created ‚Äì often by different writers, and sometimes even in different comics ‚Äì were later linked to each other. This could be done either by a crossover story in which two or more characters from the respective series meet each other, or by a caption or piece of dialogue explicitly referring to events which occurred or characters who appeared in an earlier story in another series. Two examples of the former kind are the Judge Dredd stories \\"Top Dog\\" and \\"Judgement Day\\", which both featured Johnny Alpha from the series Strontium Dog in a major role. Alpha lived over half a century in Dredd's future, and the crossover was accomplished by having Alpha time- travel back to Dredd's era. An example of the second kind is the Judge Dredd story \\"The Cursed Earth,\\" which featured a dinosaur called Satanus who was described as the clone of the offspring of the female dinosaur which had appeared in most episodes of the earlier series Flesh. Flesh was a previously unconnected series about humans time travelling back to the Cretaceous era to harvest dinosaurs for their meat. Sometimes the link between two series can be of paramount importance to the story (such as Alpha's appearance in Judge Dredd); in other stories the reference can be a passing homage to an earlier tale with no effect whatsoever on the plot of the story in which it occurs (such as the reference to Satanus' ancestry in \\"The Cursed Earth\\"). In either case, once a connection between two series was established, it was often repeated. For example, \\"Top Dog\\" was followed up by \\"Judgement Day,\\" and the reference to Flesh in Judge Dredd was reciprocated by the cameo appearance of a Mega-City judge in Nemesis the Warlock Book V, which was itself a crossover with Flesh because it featured Satanus in a major role. This latter example illustrates how series were not just linked to each other in pairs, but in multitudes. Pat Mills, the first editor of 2000 AD and creator of many enduring series, was responsible for many such connections. He deliberately connected his own series ABC Warriors to Flesh, and then linked Nemesis to both. (All three series were created by him, but they had originally had nothing to do with each other.) For example, ABC Warriors made a passing reference to a dinosaur being the son of Satanus. Satanus himself subsequently played an important part in Nemesis Book V, by which time the entire cast of ABC Warriors had themselves moved to the Nemesis strip. This therefore established that Judge Dredd, Flesh, Nemesis, and ABC Warriors all existed in the same continuity: a list which would be added to many more times. =Spin- offs= Secondly, a new series can be created as a deliberate offshoot from a parent series. This can also occur in two ways. One method was to take a supporting character from an existing series and start a new series with that character in the lead (sometimes with the lead character from the original series appearing in a cameo). Two examples are Judge Anderson, first introduced in Judge Dredd, being given her own series, Anderson: Psi Division, five years later; and Durham Red getting her own series after her debut in Strontium Dog. Since Judge Dredd and Strontium Dog occupy the same universe, it follows that Anderson and Red do too (although they have never both appeared in the same story). Another method was to create a brand new character for a new series, but to state from the outset that the story took place in an existing environment from an established strip. Most of the series in the Judge Dredd Megazine were created in this way. In 2000 AD The 86ers was a series set in the world of Rogue Trooper which did not feature the established cast of its parent strip. = Early issues = In the earliest issues and annuals, connections and crossovers would link up many of the earliest strips. The most prominent examples are Harlem Heroes ending and then the lead character's son turning up as a cadet judge in the next issue; The Cursed Earth linking Dredd's future to Flesh with Satanus, the cloned son of tyrannosaur One-Eye; and ABC Warriors starting as a prequel to Ro-Busters, a sequel to Invasion!, and then introducing a sequel to Flesh and The Cursed Earth with Satanus's son. Minor links included Ro-Jaws watching the Harlem Heroes and a comrade of Hammerstein referring to the under-construction Mega- City One in Ro-Busters flashbacks; a Mega-City Time Tour feature in an annual, where Flesh corporation Trans-Time offered holidays to both 2103 Mega-City One and 1999 Volgan-occupied England.Reprinted in Judge Dredd: The Restricted Files vol. 4 =Rogue Trooper= The series Rogue Trooper was both a crossover and a spin-off from itself. The original series ran in 2000 AD from issues 228 to 635, when it ended. A completely new series of Rogue Trooper then began in issue 650, by a different writer. This was not intended to be a sequel to the old version, but was a brand new, modernised reinterpretation of the character, with significant differences from the old version. It was not supposed to be set in the same universe or continuity, but was a total replacement (or \\"reboot\\") of both. However, years later and in the hands of a new writer, a story was written which established that the new and old Rogue Troopers were two different people inhabiting the same universe, and a convoluted continuity was contrived to explain their co-existence. In an unusually complicated crossover, the two Rogue Troopers actually met each other. This state of affairs did not continue for long, however, and the old version was killed off. Ironically, the new version declined in popularity and the strip was discontinued, only to be replaced with the original version, in stories set before the original's death. There have been a number of less complicated Rogue Trooper spinoffs largely following the adventures of the other G.I.s, like Venus Bluegenes, Rafaelle Blue and Tor Cyan. The new version of Rogue met Judge Dredd in a special story which took up the whole of issue 900 (the first time this had ever happened in what is usually an anthology comic containing five stories per issue). =Laissez-faire approach= While 2000 AD writers and editors have generally ensured that events occurring in spin-offs and their parent series are usually mutually consistent with each other, so that events in one such strip do not contradict events in another, much less care ‚Äì if any ‚Äì is taken to ensure a uniform continuity between crossover series. Therefore, while events which occur in the Anderson, Psi Division spin-off may have repercussions in Judge Dredd and vice versa, the continuity of Strontium Dog might be ignored. This can even occur within the crossover story itself: in \\"Judgement Day\\" Johnny Alpha travelled back in time from 2178 to 2114 to arrest a time-travelling criminal so he would not wipe out Earth (and thus, the future). The death of three billion people and destruction of five whole mega-cities then seemed to have no impact on Alpha's era. It was never explained in the story how an event as significant as a world war did not appear to be remembered by history in Alpha's era. On top of that, the future history of Strontium Dog bears little resemblance to Dredd, with no mega-cities and mutants as an underclass in 'norm' cities in 2150. (The Americans in Judge Dredd Megazine no. 283 implied that Strontium Dog's nuclear war will occur in 2150, but this was a MacGuffin to drive the story forward.) In these cases, the crossover is not a serious attempt at world- building and continuity, simply a means of having two popular characters meet. Writer John Wagner has even stated that he does not view Strontium Dog and Judge Dredd as being in the same continuity.Wagner's Facebook page, statement in reply to a November 6, 2009 comment Writers have also changed their minds over time. In the 2000s ABC Warriors stories, there is no attempt at fitting the Volgan War into Dredd's timeline or Harlem Heroes (but he does refer to Nemesis The Warlock in Dredd: Blood of Satanus II, in order to declare Satanus Unchained out of canon). Other writers have also made no mention of this, and generally do not link up non-Dredd strips. It is also a habit of writers who created a strip to ignore the work of others if they feel like it. The John Wagner story Origins refers to Pat Mills' Dredd stories but makes no attempt to acknowledge Invasion!, ABC Warriors, and Ro-Busters (or Harlem Heroes); The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha acknowledges and retcons his death under Alan Grant, but deliberately erases Strontium Dogs (with a narrator calling Peter Hogan's strips the work of \\"notorious fantasist Ho Gan\\"). In the sequel series Savage, Mills acknowledges the original Invasion! (to the extent that there's a King Charles III in the 2000s, just as prog 1 said) but ignores the prequel strip Disaster 1990!. And while Harlem Heroes was linked to Dredd, the sequel strip Inferno was left separate until Al Ewing's Dredd Year One: Wear Iron novella. Crossovers As most of the 2000 AD crossovers occur on the same timeline, not in parallel universes, the majority of crossovers take place thanks to the widespread, but temperamental, time travel technology that was invented at the beginning of the 22nd century. =Stories by Pat Mills= Pat Mills was responsible for the majority of the crossovers. *Judge Dredd: \\"The Cursed Earth\\" introduced the dinosaur Satanus and linked Judge Dredd to Flesh.Mills, Pat (2017) Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History (Millsverse Books), p. 103 *ABC Warriors: \\"Golgotha\\", in the first series, featured the son of Satanus and linked ABC Warriors to Flesh. *Nemesis the Warlock: \\"Book IV: The Gothic Empire\\" introduced both the ABC Warriors and the Ro-Jaws character from Ro-Busters to Nemesis. \\"Book V: The Vengeance of Thoth\\" featured the return of Satanus in a major role, and a cameo by a judge of Mega-City One, linking Nemesis to Flesh and Judge Dredd. In a later Dredd strip by Mills, Dredd referred to Satanus' return to the Cretaceous in Nemesis (how he knew about it was not explained). *Judge Dredd: \\"Hammerstein\\" featured ABC Warrior Hammerstein in the Cursed Earth outside Mega-City One, following the Atomic Wars started by President Booth in 2070. This linked ABC Warriors to Judge Dredd, in addition to the existing Satanus connection. (This link was retconned away in other strips.) *The Volgans appear as the enemies of Bill Savage in Invasion!, and also in early episodes of ABC Warriors as the enemies of the character Hammerstein and the creators of the ABC warrior Blackblood. Flashback stories have shown more of the Volgan War, and Volgan robot Volkhan was introduced as a 'present' day villain in The Volgan War Book One. *Savage Books 5, 6 and 7 included characters and backstory from Ro-Busters. *Another ABC Warriors story in 2012, \\"Return to Earth,\\" established further links between Savage and Ro-Busters.2000 AD progs 1800-1812 =Stories by Ian Edginton= Writer Ian Edginton has begun linking his pseudo-historical strips together, both covertly and overtly. Images of both Jack Dancer from The Red Seas and Hastur from Leviathan later appeared in Stickleback; the pub \\"The Jolly Cripple\\", a haunt of the Red Seas pirates, reappears as the haunt of the character Detective Valentine and contains a portrait of the original proprietress from Red Seas;D'Blog of 'Israeli: References In Stickleback Parts 1 & 2 and Leviathan villain William Ashbless briefly appears in Stickleback as a member of the sinister City Fathers group.D'Blog of 'Israeli: Stickleback Part 8 References In the second Stickleback, the eponymous lead visits the London-based Brotherhood of the Book from The Red Seas, in the process meeting (and revealing history with) Seas villain Orlando Doyle. There is also an appearance by Herbert Sewell, an unfortunate and long-suffering scientist/time traveller in Edginton's Judge Dredd stories, being dragged into Bedlam; and an ogre of the same species seen in Edginton's American Gothic Wild West strip is seen at the villain's Wild West show. The Red Seas would later reveal that Stickleback's Orlando was from an alternate universe, and that the Brotherhood of the Book exists in multiple universes. Ampney Crucis Investigates made the connections stronger: characters referred to the Leviathan ship and the myth of the Hollow Earth from The Red Seas; the otherworldly monsters were given a similar background as in Stickleback; and a shadowy antagonist was shown to have a staff with a bust of Hastur's head. Stickleback's son appears in the fourth Ampney Crucis story as an adult, London's crime lord in an alternate dimension where the First World War never happened; in the same world, an underground society of cyborg fanatics called \\"Babbagists\\" has sprung up around the works of Countess Bernoulli, a Stickleback villain. =Stories by John Smith= The writer John Smith often places a number of his characters in the same stories, which has become known among fans as The Smithiverse. These have never been explicitly linked to the other 2000 AD stories, but stand together as an independent universe of their own. However, one particular species of alien of Smith's creation has appeared in both the Smithiverse (in Firekind and Tyranny Rex) and in a Judge Dredd universe story (Pussyfoot 5, a spin-off from Devlin Waugh). Smithiverse stories include Indigo Prime, Tyranny Rex and Firekind. =Stories by other writers= Judge Dredd stories A number of characters have appeared in Judge Dredd stories (or vice versa). =Ant Wars= Dredd spinoff Zancudo! by Simon Spurrier revealed itself to be a sequel to Ant Wars, a 1970s strip about giant ants rampaging through South America, in the cliffhanger ending to Part 2. The giant ants were revealed to be living in the jungles near Ciudad Barranquilla, and were at war with the giant mosquitos that formed the strip's villains. =Harlem Heroes= The first Judge Giant was the son of Giant of the Harlem Heroes, and his father was shown upon Giant's graduation from the Academy of Law.\\"The Academy of Law\\" (by John Wagner) Later on, Judge Giant Jr (the first Judge Giant's son) would meet his aged grandfather a few days before he died.Judge Dredd Megazine #216 =Rogue Trooper= Souther troops flee Nu-Earth back through time to Mega-City One in 2116. They reach an agreement with the judges where they swap medical aid for technology. Friday is blamed for the massacre but, as his memory returns, he realises a traitor is at work and tries to track him down. Unfortunately it seems a far more famous clone may try and stop him ‚Äì Judge Dredd.Judge Dredd: \\"Casualties Of War\\" (by John Wagner and John Higgins, in 2000 AD #900, 1994) An early version of the Genetic Infantry program is shown in Judge Dredd: Warzone.Judge Dredd Megazine #440-43 =Skizz= The Gunlords of Omega Ceti try to kill Skizz by travelling back in time but somehow end up in 22nd century Australia where they met Dredd.Skizz: \\"Skizz Book 3\\" (by Jim Baikie, in 2000 AD #912‚Äì927, 1994) =Strontium Dog= Dredd has crossed the path of Strontium Dogs Johnny Alpha and Wulf Sternhammer a couple of times. In the first encounter they travelled back in time to Mega- City One, 2112, and were nearly arrested by Dredd.\\"Top Dogs\\" (by John Wagner, in Judge Dredd Annual 1991, 1990) Later, Johnny Alpha again stepped back in time to 2114 and helped Judge Dredd save Mega-City One from a zombie apocalypse during Judgement Day.Judgement Day\\" (by Garth Ennis/John Wagner; art by Peter Doherty & Carlos Ezquerra tpb, 1999, collects Judgement Day in 2000 AD #786‚Äì799 and Judge Dredd Megazine #2.4‚Äì9, 1992) A spin-off audio drama, Pre-Emptive Revenge, by Big Finish showed Dredd and Alpha in the immediate aftermath of Judgement Day. =Judge Dredd: \\"Helter Skelter\\"= Helter Skelter was a storyline by Garth Ennis, featuring an invasion of Mega- City One by an alliance of villains from parallel universes. Due to the distortion of reality, characters from dozens of 2000 AD strips made cameo appearances, either in the background or as parts of the plot (Dredd is attacked by the vampires from Fiends of the Eastern Front and then has to avoid Old One-Eye from Flesh). =Judge Dredd: \\"The Cold Deck\\" and \\"Trifecta\\"= The Cold Deck was a story written by Al Ewing which ran in 2000 AD at the same time as two other series set in Dredd's world, The Simping Detective and Low Life. These stories initially appeared to have no other connection with each other, but after each of them had been running independently for a couple of issues their plotlines unexpectedly intertwined with each other, and it became apparent that Ewing had collaborated with the writers of the other two series, Simon Spurrier and Rob Williams, to create a single large crossover story. The three series merged into a single story for their concluding part, called Trifecta, which took up every page of 2000 AD #1812. =Judge Dredd: \\"End of Days\\"= In the \\"End of Days\\" by Rob Williams (2020), Ichabod Azrael from The Grievous Journey of Ichabod Azrael (and the Dead Left in his Wake) travels to Dredd's world to stop the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from destroying the world. Rogue Trooper and Mercy Heights *Rogue Trooper: \\"Blue on Blue\\" and sequels joined together the original and new versions of the character in the same continuity (see above). *Mercy Heights was initially a new series with no connection to Rogue Trooper. When the series ended Tor Cyan, a character from the series, began his own eponymous series, in which it was eventually revealed that he was a genetic infantryman like Rogue Trooper. Spin-offs This list does not include direct sequels, such as Inferno and Savage. =Judge Dredd spin- offs= Judge Dredd spin-offs include: *Anderson: Psi Division *Armitage *Banzai Battalion *Chopper *Cursed Earth Koburn *The Dead Man *Devlin Waugh Pussyfoot 5 *Janus: Psi Division *Judge Death *Judge Hershey *Juliet November *Mean Machine *Purgatory *Red Razors *Shimura *The Simping Detective *Tales from the Black Museum *Walter the Wobot =Rogue Trooper spin-offs= The original Rogue Trooper led to: *The new version, \\"Friday\\" *Venus Bluegenes *The 86ers *Jaegir *Hunted See also Tor Cyan =Other spin-offs= *ABC Warriors was a spin-off from Ro-Busters *Deadlock was a spin-off from ABC Warriors *Durham Red, Young Middenface, Tales From the Doghouse and Strontium Dogs were spin-offs from Strontium Dog *Tor Cyan was a spin-off from Mercy Heights Parallel universes As well as the tying together of a lot of the stories in 2000 AD, other parallel universes are known to co-exist alongside the main one, and some of them have intruded into it. Most famously in Judge Dredd, this has happened with Judge Death and the Dark Judges, coming from a reality where life is a crime. The aforementioned \\"Helter Skelter\\" had a wide range of deceased villains coming from alternate dimensions where they had won, and \\"Rehab\\" (progs 1644-8) featured an incursion from a utopian Earth where the Judges are pacifists focused on rehabilitation. Since 2003, Sinister Dexter has been running a storyline where criminals from a parallel Earth, led by \\"Holy\\" Moses Tanenbaum (dead in the main universe), have been trying to take over the city of Downlode in the main universe. When the other Earth was shown, it was revealed a major reason for the move was that China (\\"the ChiComs\\") were winning a war against Russia and rapidly advancing towards Downlode. The final part saw Sinister and Dexter chasing a target through other 2000 AD strips, which turned out to be other realities. Intercompany crossovers Lobo. Art by Val Semeiks. There have been numerous intercompany crossovers between 2000 AD stories and with stories published by other companies (DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics). Given his high-profile these often mix other characters with Judge Dredd. These include: =Aliens= Mr Bones eventually manages to launch his revenge on Mega-City One, unleashing the Xenomorph (called the Incubus here) into the Grand Hall of Justice itself.Judge Dredd vs. Aliens: Incubus (written by John Wagner and Andy Diggle, with art by Henry Flint, in 2000 AD #1332‚Äì1335, 2003, tpb, 104 pages, Rebellion Developments, 2003, , Dark Horse, 2004, ) Aliens crossover publication details The story has been mentioned a few times, though the xenomorph's exact origin was kept quiet. =Batman= There have been four crossovers with Batman: a team-up with Dredd to defeat the combined might of Judge Death, Mean Machine, and The Scarecrow, with the two heroes clashing; Dredd going to Gotham City to save Batman from the Ventriloquist; both heroes being part of a faked deathmatch run by the Riddler; and the Joker and the Dark Judges teaming up, with the Joker becoming a fifth Dark Judge.Judgement on Gotham (written by John Wagner and Alan Grant, with art by Simon Bisley, graphic novel, 1991) and three sequels Batman crossover publication details The Batman crossovers have had significant impact on Dredd's world. A vision of the fourth crossover, Die Laughing, causing Cassandra Anderson to return to being a Judge, as the crossover was written before she had quit and had been delayed. Judge Death was finally captured due to the events of Judgement on Gotham. Die Laughing had the Dark Judges encased in plasteen crystals, which is how they would always be shown in later stories and the Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death video game; the 2002 story My Name is Death had Dredd refer to \\"that Gotham clown\\". =Lobo= Lobo, the intergalactic mercenary, became a popular character when Alan Grant took on the writing duties so a run-in with Dredd was a logical progression.Judge Dredd vs. Lobo: Psycho-Bikers vs The Mutants From Hell (written by John Wagner and Alan Grant, with pencils by Val Semeiks, inks by John Dell and colours by Gloria Vasquez, 48 pages, DC, 1995, ) Lobo crossover publication details =Predator= The Predator has made many visits to Earth throughout history, and in a number of parallel universes, so it was almost inevitable that they would eventually clash with Dredd. The events of the first Predator film and the first comic issuesThe Judges say it had visited New York. This never happened in the film but did in the Predator comic book story Concrete Jungle, written by Mark Verheiden are placed in Dredd continuity: not only are the Judges aware of the events, Psi-Judge Schaefer is a direct descendant of the film character \\"Dutch\\" Schaefer. Predator vs. Judge Dredd (written by John Wagner, with art by Enrique Alcatera, 80 pages, Titan, 1998, , Dark Horse Comics, 1999, ) Predator crossover publication details =Predator vs Judge Dredd vs Aliens= Starting in July 2016, Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue mini-series, Predator vs Judge Dredd vs Aliens, written by John Layman and illustrated by Chris Mooneyham. =Judge Dredd vs Razorjack= In May 2018 writer Michael Carroll and artist John Higgins produced a crossover story featuring Razorjack, an independent comic on which they had both worked before.Judge Dredd Magazine #396 =Doctor Who= There has never been a crossover between a 2000 AD character and Doctor Who. However writer Dave Stone, who has written several Judge Dredd and Doctor Who novels, planned a crossover novel featuring both Dredd and the Doctor, called \\"Burning Heart.\\" This idea was cancelled due to the lack of success of the 1995 Judge Dredd film, and the book was published in 1997 as a Dr Who book without Dredd.\\"I, Who\\" Lars Pearson, Sidewinder Press, 1999FinnClark.org (book review) The Virgin Books Who stories featured the Guild of Adjudicators, a law enforcement agency who were often presented as similar to the Judges. In the revived television series, the episode Gridlock was based on Mega-City One, and one character was deliberately dressed like Max Normal. Character Sally Calypso was also homage to 2000 AD strip Halo Jones, which featured a similar character named Swifty Frisko.See Doctor Who Confidential episode \\"Are We There Yet?\\" Pseudonyms and cameos Occasionally real life creators and individuals pop up in disguise. =Pseudonyms= Some work in 2000 AD has been done by people using pseudonyms to prevent readers from guessing that their series were connected, when writing stories where the connection was to be a surprise: * Cal Hamilton ‚Äì Dan Abnett, first used the pseudonym when he did the initial run on James Bond Jr. (he then took over writing duties under his own name) and later resurrected it to disguise the fact that Malone tied into Sinister Dexter.*Dan Abnett's blog entry where he reveals he was Cal Hamilton * Keef Ripley ‚Äì John Wagner used the name when he wrote \\"The Dead Man\\" so that fans wouldn't guess it was actually a Judge Dredd story. * G. Powell ‚Äì Simon Spurrier used this name when he wrote \\"The Vort\\" so that fans wouldn't guess the disfigured character nicknamed 'Crispy' was in fact Lobster Random. =Cameos= People from the comics world, as well as public figures, have made cameo appearances within 2000 AD including: * B.L.A.I.R. 1 was clearly based on British Prime Minister Tony Blair, as well as being a parody of early strip M.A.C.H. 1. Tony Blair is also parodied in Day of Chaos as mayoral candidate Tony Blore. * Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan have appeared in Judge Dredd and Strontium Dog, respectively. In Reagan's case, it was a significant multi-part story. * Judge Cal's appearance was based on Pat Mills, and his persona was based on Caligula as shown in the popular I, Claudius. * Judge Logan has appeared in a number of stories including the epic \\"Origins\\" and is named after W.R. Logan who started Class of '79. * Kenny Who? is based on artist Cam Kennedy and his storylines (drawn by Kennedy) dealt with issues he encountered in the American comic industry. In the last Who? strip, robot versions of writer Alan Grant and his wife appear in the strip. * The creator droids have appeared in several Tharg strips, intended to be specific creators (the comic pretends the real-life creators are robots). Timeline Unlike both the DC and Marvel Universes, many of the 2000 AD crossovers are done via a timeline: characters and concepts appear in the past/future of other strips, and may time travel to each other.

The original spelling of the name was \\"Piquetberg\\". The town is in the foothills of the Piketberg mountains, a range of low mountains formed from Table Mountain Sandstone. The area around the mountains is conducive to the farming of wheat, while the area on top of the mountains, being cooler and generally frost-free, is suited to the farming of fruit and Rooibos Tea. Piketberg possesses a large Dutch Reformed Church designed by the architect Carl Otto Hager in his trademark neo-Gothic style.  History  The area was inhabited by the Khoikhoi and the San before the arrival of 21 Dutch, Huguenot and German families in 1705-06, and there is still well-preserved San rock art in the mountains. There was once a small military post in the town to protect the livestock of farmers from raids by the Khoikhoi. By the 1730s the population had grown to 35 families and around 400 White people. The Holtzhausen, Reyneke, Joubert, van Rooyen, Niewoudt and Visagie families are among the earliest settler-pioneers of 1705-06. The Picquet commando was established in 1711 by the VOC and consisted of a squad of 15 Riflemen of the Militia and a single 80 mm field cannon for protection against depredations of natives and wild animals. The cannon-fire protected the European-descended farming community from the attacks of the indigenous groups, the \\"Gonjemans\\". The community used its cannon to signal the arrival of ships in Cape Town. Piketberg's farmers would load their carts with produce and wares. Then head to Cape Town to do business. The cannon also fired on special occasions like Queen Victoria's birthday and the arrival of the town's first telephone line. It fired for the last time in the 1961 on the proclamation of the Republic. A misfire left the school's windows aflame. Hereafter, the cannon was filled with cement. Until recently, the Piketberg cannon stood in front of Piketberg High School, aimed East, in the direction of Porterville High School, its rival. Jewish Heritage The many Jewish surnames in Piketberg's historic graveyard bear witness to its once-vigorous Jewish community. Most had Lithuanian roots. They were entrepreneurs and raised themselves out of poverty by wheeling and dealing from farmstead to farmstead. Lodewyk Ando Simon, of Hungarian Jewish descent, moved from nearby Redelinghuys to Piketberg and built the synagogue in 1925. It is estimated that 30 Jewish families lived in Piketberg at this time. Rabbi Moses Beraitzer, was the first rabbi. He was a strict shepherd to his flock. Though blind in his later years, the Rabbi served undaunted, and preached the Talmud from memory. It is unsure when the congregation disbanded. The University of Cape Town's Kaplan Centre houses several of the synagogue's historic documents. Since 1996 the synagogue has been home to the Piketberg Tourism Bureau. In recent years the synagogue has been part of the town museum. In February 2004 descendants of Piketberg's lost Jewish community celebrated their roots with a tree planting ceremony.  Bio-scope  The Piketberg Bio- scope building was built in the late 1920s. It was one of the first bios in the region. During the 1970s the cinema ran performances on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Bruce Lee and James Bond movies were popular. South Africa's segregation also crept into the movie theatre. Non-whites sat in the gallery and whites sat on the main seats.  Notable people  * Shaun Abrahams, former national director of public prosecutions (NDPP) at the National Prosecuting Authority was born in Piketberg. *Sheila Cussons (1922-2004), Afrikaans language writer and poet was born in Piketberg. *Andries Treurnicht (1921-1993), Apartheid era National Party politician a former Minister of Education was born in the town. *Colla Swart (b. 1930), noted photographer and resident of Piketberg.

Domengeaux, known as Jimmy Domengeaux (January 6, 1907 - April 11, 1988), was a lawyer from Lafayette, Louisiana, who served in the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district from 1941 to 1949. He was a cultural activist of Cajun and Louisiana Creole descent who is best remembered for his efforts to preserve the French language in his native state. Background Domengeaux was born in Lafayette to J. Rudolph Domengeaux and the former Marthe Mouton. He attended Mount Carmel Academy and Cathedral High School in Lafayette. He obtained his undergraduate degree from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then \\"Southwestern Louisiana Institute\\"). He also studied in New Orleans at both Loyola University and Tulane University Law School, from which he received his legal degree in 1931. He was admitted to the bar that same year and launched his law practice in Lafayette. In 1962, Domengeaux was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. He was senior member of Domengeaux and Wright (1931‚Äì1984). The firm maintained offices in Lafayette, New Orleans, Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish, and Opelousas, the seat of St. Landry Parish in south central Louisiana. Domengeaux was married to the former Eleanor St. Julien (1921‚Äì2004); they had no children. They are interred at St. John's Cemetery in Lafayette. Political career He was a member, briefly, of the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1940, until he was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House. He defeated the Republican sugar planter, David W. Pipes, Jr., of Terrebonne Parish. Domengeaux first served in the U.S. House from 1941 to April 15, 1944, when he resigned to join the armed forces. He was a private in the Combat Engineers until he received a medical discharge. Thereafter, he was elected on November 7, 1944, to fill the vacancy in the 78th Congress caused by his own resignation. He hence served again from 1944 to 1949. Domengeaux did not seek reelection to Congress in 1948. Instead, he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Senator Allen J. Ellender. He was succeeded in the House by the freshman State Senator Edwin E. Willis of St. Martinville, the seat of St. Martin Parish. He returned to the private practice of law in 1949. As cultural activist In 1968 Domengeaux accepted an appointment from Louisiana Governor John McKeithen, his fellow Democrat, to preside over a new state-charted organization called the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, commonly known by the acronym CODOFIL. As president of CODOFIL, Domengeaux spearheaded a statewide effort to introduce French education in public classrooms from elementary through high school levels. He did so largely by recruiting teachers from France, Belgium, Quebec, and other French-speaking regions and nations around the world. Such recruitment placed Domengeaux at odds with the educational establishment, which preferred the hiring of local teachers. This effort represented a major shift for Louisiana's educational system, which for decades had punished Cajun children for speaking French in school ‚Äî a practice that more than any other factor had dramatically reduced the number of native French speakers in the state.Shane K. Bernard, The Cajuns: Americanization of a People (Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2003), p. xx, xxii-xxiii, 18-19, 33-34, 83. In 1976, Domengeaux arranged for the then French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing to visit Lafayette. In the 1980s, Domengeaux embraced a new teaching method: French immersion, in which children were to be taught a variety of subjects in French for 60 percent of the school day. This method replaced the previous, less successful method of teaching French in only thirty-minute daily increments. In addition to advancing French education, Domengeaux used CODOFIL as a watchdog organization that defended Cajuns from perceived affronts. For example, Domengeaux crusaded against use of the word \\"coonass,\\" which he considered an ethnic slur against the Cajun people; and he condemned such Cajun humorists as the popular Justin Wilson, who was born not in Acadiana, but in Tangipahoa Parish, one of the \\"Florida Parishes\\" east of Baton Rouge, and who disagreed with Domengeaux politically. A charismatic public figure, Domengeaux was often at odds with detractors, who criticized his reliance on international teachers as well as his emphasis on continental French to the exclusion of Cajun French. For his efforts to save the French language in Louisiana, Domengeaux received an honorary doctorate from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, the Order of the Legion of Honor from the French government, and the Order of the Crown from Belgium, among numerous other citations. On November 11, 1986, coinciding with Veterans Day, Lafayette Mayor William Dudley \\"Dud\\" Lastrapes and Governor Edwin Washington Edwards proclaimed \\"Jimmy Domengeaux Day\\". The University of Louisiana at Lafayette created an \\"Eminent Scholar Chair in Foreign Languages\\" in Domengeaux's honor. The organization over which Domengeaux presided for the last two decades of his life, CODOFIL, continues to coordinate French education in Louisiana; and in his honor CODOFIL's supporting foundation offers a scholarship known as the Bourse James Domengeaux (James Domengeaux Scholarship).

ELRA broadening its objectives and responsibilities towards the HLT community over the years, and is now also involved in the production, or commissioning of the production, of language resources through a number of initiatives, and actively committed to the evaluation of language-engineering tools as well as to the identification of new resources. The set up of the identification number system ISLRN,Val√©rie Mapelli, Vladimir Popescu, Lin Liu and Khalid Choukri, \\"Language Resource Citation: The ISLRN Dissemination and Further Developments\\" endorsed by NLP12 in 2013, is the most recent initiative led by ELDA to enhance the identification of language resources and their citation in publications. Every other year, ELRA organizes a major conference, the International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC). Mission The mission of the Association is to promote language resources and evaluation for the Human Language Technology sector in all their forms and their uses, in a European context. Consequently, the goals are: to coordinate and carry out identification, production, validation, distribution, standardisation of languages resources, as well as support for evaluation of systems, products, tools, etc. Information Dissemination is also part of ELRA's missions which is carried through both the organisation of the conference LREC and the Language Resources and Evaluation JournalLanguage Resources and Evaluation Journal edited by Springer.
