One of the oldest theaters in the United States, it was built in 1852 and was originally known as the Boston Music Hall, the original home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The concert hall was converted for use as a vaudeville theater in 1900. It was renamed the Orpheum Theatre in 1906. In 1915, the Orpheum was acquired by Loew's Theatres and substantially rebuilt. It operates as a mixed-use hall, primarily for live music concerts. The theater has no connection with Boston's Music Hall, currently known as the Wang Theatre. History When the Boston Symphony moved to Symphony Hall in 1900, the Boston Music Hall closed. It was converted, for use as a vaudeville theater in 1900 and operated under a number of different names, including the Music Hall and the Empire Theatre. In 1906, it was renamed the Orpheum Theatre. In 1915, the theater was acquired by the Loew's Theatres. Loew's reopened the Orpheum in 1916 with a completely new interior designed by architect Thomas W. Lamb. Operated by Loew's, the theater was at first a combination vaudeville and movie theater and later a straight first-run movie house. The Orpheum closed as a movie theatre on January 31, 1971 and reopened as the Aquarius, a live concert hall, on May 27, 1971. The first featured performer was James Brown. The new owner was an African-American business owner and activist named Arthur Scott. compared his new venture to the Apollo Theater in New York City. From 1975 to 1979, the Orpheum served as the home of the Opera Company of Boston, under director Sarah Caldwell, until that company moved to the current Boston Opera House. The first half of The Police's 1995 double album Live! was recorded at the Orpheum on November 27, 1979. U2's performance at the theater in 1983 was recorded and broadcast on The King Biscuit Flower Hour. In 1984, the original lineup of Aerosmith reformed with a performance at the Orpheum. Tin Machine recorded a portion of their live album, entitled Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby, at the theater on November 20, 1991. Portions of the March 3-4, 1992 shows at the Orpheum by the Allman Brothers, were used on their 1992 live CD An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: First Set and the cover photo was taken in front of the venue's marquee. Currently, the theater is owned by the Drucker Realty Company. The contract to operate the Orpheum was acquired by Don Law, a Boston concert promoter, from the Live Nation entertainment company, in 2009. Law announced a major renovation for the theater, after which it reopened in late 2009. Live Nation retains a stake in the operations of Law's company, Crossroads Presents. The current entrance to the theater is the former alley entrance, replacing the original entrance on Washington Street, which was converted into retail space.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cleveland Indians. Prior to playing professionally, he played college baseball at Northwestern University. He bats and throws right-handed. Amateur career Kontos attended Niles West High School in Skokie, Illinois, where he was named the high school baseball player of the year in Illinois in 2003. He also lettered in golf and basketball. Kontos attended Northwestern University as an economics major, where he played for the Northwestern Wildcats baseball team in the Big Ten Conference. In 2005, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The New York Yankees selected Kontos in the fifth round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft after his junior year. Professional career Minor Leagues Kontos signed with the Yankees after his college career and played for the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League in 2006, winning the league championship. With a 7‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record, 2.64 ERA, and 82 strikeouts in 78 innings pitched, Baseball America named Kontos a Short-Season All-Star. He pitched for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2007 and the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League in 2008. After starting the 2009 season with Trenton, he was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. After experiencing tightness in his pitching arm in June 2009, Kontos went on the disabled list in what he thought was a precautionary measure. Magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow, which required Tommy John surgery, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. Returning to action in 2010 after a ten-month recovery, Kontos shifted into a relief pitcher. That season, he pitched for Tampa, Trenton, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. After the 2010 season, the Yankees opted not to protect Kontos on their 40-man roster. Consequently, he was selected by the San Diego Padres from the Yankees in the Rule 5 draft that offseason. After making three appearances for the Padres during spring training in 2011, he was returned to the Yankees prior to the regular season. Kontos began his 2011 minor league season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he pitched to a 4‚Äì4 win‚Äìloss record and a 2.64 ERA in 40 appearances. New York Yankees (2011) Kontos made his major league debut on September 10, 2011 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Appearing in seven games for the Yankees, Kontos pitched to a 3.00 ERA in six innings, while striking out six batters. Kontos was also part of the Yankees postseason roster until the Yankees lost to the Detroit Tigers in the 2011 ALDS. San Francisco Giants (2012‚Äì2017) Due in part to a back injury suffered by Yankees catcher Austin Romine, the Yankees traded Kontos to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for catcher Chris Stewart before the start of the 2012 season. He began the season with the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. After starting the season with a 2‚Äì0 win-loss record and a 1.71 ERA in 23 appearances, the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on June 10. Through August 14, he pitched to a 2.33 ERA and a 1.15 walks plus hits per innings pitched (WHIP) ratio in 26 games, becoming a reliable member of the Giants bullpen. Kontos got his first major league win in relief of Barry Zito, successfully recording 7 outs without allowing a baserunner. The Giants went on to win the game 6‚Äì4 against the Astros. Kontos entered the postseason for a second straight season and eventually won the 2012 World Series with the Giants in a four-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers. In 2013, Kontos was named to the opening-day 25-man roster. On June 11, 2013, Kontos was ejected for the first time in his Major League career after hitting Pittsburgh Pirates center fielder Andrew McCutchen with a pitch. Kontos was suspended three games by the commissioner's office and optioned to Triple-A Fresno on June 12. Kontos was recalled to the majors on June 24. On July 22, Kontos threw a career-high 63 pitches in an 11‚Äì0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds that helped save the Giants' bullpen before a doubleheader the following day. Kontos was optioned back to Triple-A on July 23 and wasn't recalled until rosters expanded in September. On September 20, 2013, Kontos achieved notoriety as he surrendered Alex Rodriguez's 24th career grand slam that broke the record formerly held by Lou Gehrig. For the 2013 season, Kontos made 52 relief appearances, pitching innings with a 2‚Äì2 record and 4.39 ERA. In 2014, Kontos started the season in Triple-A Fresno. During the season, he was called up to the Majors and sent back to Fresno four times. In 24 games with the Giants, he pitched innings with 27 strikeouts, a 4‚Äì0 record, and 2.88 ERA. He was left off the postseason roster. Kontos was named to the Giants' opening- day roster for 2015. Through July 11, Kontos stranded all 25 base runners he inherited on the season. Kontos appeared in a career-high 73 games, recording a career-best 0.941 WHIP and holding opponents to a .159 average with runners in scoring position, third-best in the Majors. In 2015, Kontos pitched innings, with 44 strikeouts, a 4‚Äì4 record, and 2.33 ERA. On February 1, 2016, Kontos agreed to a one-year, $1.15 million contract with the San Francisco Giants, avoiding arbitration. After appearing in eight of the Giants' first 13 games of the 2016 season, Kontos went on the disabled list with a strained flexor.http://www.sfchronicle.com/giants/article/Giants-George-Kontos-to-DL- more-bad-bullpen-7256797.php?t=22d43012cd74b6b42a In 57 games, Kontos pitched innings with 35 strikeouts and a 2.53 ERA.

Biography Marshall joined Chukka Caribbean Adventures in 2002. He had always dreamed about working with the horses at Chukka Cove, St. Ann. His enthusiasm and hard work paid off and having moved up from gardener to other positions he was transferred to the River Valley Mountain Horseback Ride at White River Valley as a tour guide. With a need for better educated workforce Chukka Caribbean Adventures had become pro-active in trying to further schooling for employees who want to learn while working. Chukka neighbour Shelly Kennedy runs a school teaching any employee of Chukka to read and write, if they want to learn. Newton became one of her most eager pupils, having grown up in a nearby village he had to work to support his family instead of continuing his education. Discovery In 2005 Devon Anderson, another animal lover and operations manager at Chukka Cove, saw something special in Newton and handpicked him to look after a trio of new dogs at Chukka Cove Farm, renowned for its polo and now home to the Jamaica Dogsled Team. It was there he first met the future sled dogs including Marbles and Jimmy and his soon-to-be instructors Rick and Anette Johnson owners of Ah- Regah Kennel & Equipment in Mahtowa, Minnesota. \\"Rick started talking to me about dog sledding; I didn't know what it was all about at the time. I watched them walk and talk to the dogs and wondered what they were doing. Rick hitched the dogs to a three-wheel cycle and asked me to run ahead and call to them in a special way ‚Äì I was surprised when they responded,\\" says Marshall. By 2006 the team was a reality; youthful exuberance and a way with animals propelled Marshall to train with huskies in Minnesota. About this Marshall had this to say: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to expect. I was looking forward to working with experienced dogs and to seeing a lot of snow. I knew it would be cold but thought it would be like a rainy day in Jamaica. On the first day they pulled me on a snowmobile ‚Äì my first time in the snow ‚Äì it was freezing and very shocking and I thought I was going to fly; so amazing to see dogs move that fast.‚Äù He was amazed by the Great Lakes Aquarium, the Minnesota Zoo, Gooseberry Falls State Park as well as the Corps of Engineers Lake Superior Marine Museum where he saw Duluth‚Äôs famous Aerial Bridge in action. Even with all of this opportunity on his return to Jamaica, Marshall found himself without a job or a place on the Team. His poignant story plays out in the feature documentary Sun Dogs (2006). Throughout 2007 he worked hard to earn back the trust of Anderson and Melville and was finally welcomed back to Chukka Caribbean Adventures and the Jamaica Dogsled Team to train and escort visitors on the company's two sled dog tours in September. As fate would have it in November, Anderson, who was to train for the 2009 Yukon Quest, had second thoughts about being away from Jamaica for so long to train and race in the Yukon and so it was decided that Newton would step in to train and qualify for the Yukon Quest. Marshall left sunny Jamaica and arrived in a freezing Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada on Friday 29 November 2007 to begin his long distance training with three-time Yukon Quest winner Hans Gatt at Gatt Kennels in Atlin, B.C. Frigid temperatures and 100-mile runs with the sled dog team were his new reality and Gatt's experience and diligence in Marshall's training would mean his ‚Äì and his team's ‚Äì survival in harsh conditions saying: ‚ÄúIn addition to learning the skills required to mush a dogsled team over long distances, Newton will need basic dog-care and camping skills in order to survive and care for fourteen dogs for ten to fourteen days, outside in the sub-arctic in the dead of winter.‚Äù Competition Newton Marshall in the Yukon Quest race Marshall was up to the task and 27‚Äì28 March 2008 he competed in the 210-mile Percy DeWolfe Memorial Mail Race from Dawson City, Yukon Territory to Eagle, Alaska and back. He finished in 7th place out of a field of 15 with a time of 24hrs and 44mins and received the Sportsmanship Award from his fellow mushers. Marshall successfully completed Alaska's Copper Basin 300 ( 10 to 13 Jan 2009) placing 13th in a field of 27 starts and became the first Jamaican ever to qualify to run in the Yukon Quest 1,000 Mile International Sled Dog Race. On 26 February 2009, he finished the Yukon Quest, placing 13th out of 29 racers. He brought 10 dogs to the finish line and earned $3,000. He also won the Challenge of the North Award. Race officials voted for the Jamaican musher because he best exemplified the \\"Spirit of the Quest,\\" which compels mushers to challenge themselves and persevere. His bright smile and positive attitude have made him a fan favourite. In 2010, JDT musher Newton Marshall made international headlines when he became the first Caribbean musher ever to finish the famous Iditarod ‚Äì the prestigious 1100-mile race from Willow to Nome, Alaska. He finished the race in 47th position out of a field of 71 mushers. His finishing time was 12 days, 4 hours, 27 minutes, 28 seconds. He trained for the race with four-time Iditarod champion Lance Mackey. 2010 Iditarod Marshall was one of the rookie mushers in the 2010 Iditarod race. He was the first Jamaican to compete in the race. His team was financially supported by Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville cafes and he was using borrowed sled dogs from Lance Mackey's Comeback Kennel. Marshall had been training with Mackey for this race. Newton came in 47th place in 12 days, 4 hours, 27 minutes, and 28 seconds. 2011 Iditarod Marshall returned to compete the next year. His bib number was 6. However, he withdrew from the race on 12 February at 1:01 pm. He had taken both his \\"layovers\\" and scratched at the checkpoint Anvik. He had 11 dogs when he scratched 2013 Iditarod After a 1-year absence Marshall returned to compete in the 2013 Iditarod independent of any major sponsorship, he ran a team of leased and borrowed dogs. He once again was forced to scratch when his now famous dog \\"Wrong Way May\\" got free from the team while Newton helped another competitor who was having trouble, May ran the trail backwards and was found 7 days later alive & well, near the race starting point nearly 300 miles from where she had gotten away. 2014 Iditarod Marshall returned to Alaska one more time, again without a Major Sponsor he funded his team with the help of a couple local businesses \\"Acme Auto Glass\\" & \\"Black Lake Buildings\\" of Wasilla, as well as donations through Crowd-funding and Social Media. With a small team of Volunteers and a borrowed mixed team of dogs from the kennels of Kathleen Fredricks & fellow competitor Wade Marrs. Newton Marshall finished the race in the 43rd position out of 69 mushers, on a trail that was called the toughest in the 42-year history of the race, and saw many veterans and past champions not make it to the finish line. He finished the race in 12 days 1 hour 5 min. 52 seconds with 13 dogs in harness and was presented with the \\"Herbie Nayokpuk Award\\" given to the musher who best mimics Herbie with his/her attitude on the trail. Newton also made headlines during the race for coming to the aide of fellow musher Scott Janssen the \\"Mushing Mortician\\" who had broken his ankle on the trail and could not get back to his sled. Janssen laid in the icy overflow of the river until Marshall arrived.

The day brings together fans, artists, and thousands of independent record stores across the world. A number of records are pressed specifically for Record Store Day, with a list of releases for each country, and are only distributed to shops participating in the event. The event began in the United States and remains headquartered there. Record Store Day has official international organizers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Australia, Spain, Hungary and Poland (since 2019). Background Plaque commemorating the creation of Record Store Day Originally pitched as an idea to create an event similar to Free Comic Book Day by Bull Moose Music's Chris Brown and Criminal Record's Eric Levin, the concept for Record Store Day was created during a brainstorming session at a meeting of independent record store owners in Baltimore, Maryland.Billboard.‚ÄúRecord Store Day Founders‚Äù, Billboard. Retrieved August 4, 2018. Record Store Day was founded in 2007 by Eric Levin, Michael Kurtz, Carrie Colliton, Amy Dorfman, Brian Poehner and Don Van Cleave, and is now celebrated at stores around the world, with hundreds of recording and other artists participating in the day by making special appearances, performances, meet and greets with their fans, the holding of fund raisers for community non-profits, and the issuing of special vinyl and CD releases along with other promotional offerings to mark the occasion. Each store holds its own event for the day, to celebrate its place in its community. Although Record Store Day, the day, only occurs once a year, Record Store Day, the organization, provides promotions, marketing, and other opportunities for stores throughout the year, maintaining a website, social media and other means of promulgating its views about the value of independent record stores. Record Store Day is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Dept. of Record Stores, along with the Coalition of Independent Music Stores and the Alliance of Independent Media Stores. Impact Universal Music's sales manager, Marc Fayd‚ÄôHerbe, has described Record Store Day as \\"the single best thing that has ever happened\\" for independent record shops. The 2013 event was credited with the highest U.S. vinyl sales, and the 2014 edition resulted in independent retailers recording the highest percentage of physical album sales, since the SoundScan system was introduced in 1991. In their 2015 Libera awards, the American Association of Independent Music awarded Record Store Day its \\"Marketplace Ally\\" award. Record Store Day 2016 produced the biggest week of sales for the vinyl LP format since the introduction of SoundScan. In the UK, the event has been criticised for catering to record collectors, rather than casual music fans, and delaying the release of non-affiliated records by monopolizing the capacity of record pressing plants. Major labels have been accused of hijacking the event, and the policy of shops being obliged to buy on a no-return basis has been criticised, along with many of the limited releases being re-sold online within hours, at inflated prices. Record Store Day by year 2008 Metallica opened the event at Rasputin Music in Mountain View, California, on April 19, 2008. There were approximately 10 special Record Store Day releases in the first year, including releases by Death Cab For Cutie, R.E.M., Stephen Malkmus, Vampire Weekend, The Teenagers, Black Kids, and Jason Mraz. Approximately 300 stores launched Record Store Day in the United States.

A panel of record executives and members from the Fender Corporation judged the entrants. Nine national semi-finalists were chosen to appear on a limited edition, compilation vinyl LP of their winning songs. The grand prize winning band, SANUK, nominated by Indianapolis, Indiana record store Indy CD & Vinyl, received a package of musical gear from the Fender Corporation and recording time with Jack Ponti and Kevin \\"The Caveman\\" Shirley. The contest was sponsored by Caroline Distribution, EMI Label Services, Fender, and Fender Music Foundation.

The official film of the event was \\"Sound It Out\\", a feature-length documentary directed by Jeanie Finlay, documenting the Sound It Out Records shop in Stockton-on-Tees, the very last record shop in Teesside. The film premiered to critical acclaim at SxSW and had its joint premiere at SheffDocFest and the Edinburgh International Film Festival.

The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census is 630. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Location Hertingfordbury lies one mile west of Hertford on the A414 road. Ribbon development along that road has yet to reach the village, which retains a rural character. The village straddles the River Mimram, on which was built a water mill in the 18th century, and lies just north of the River Lea. The northern boundary of the village is Panshanger Park, with its Great Oak, considered by some to be the oldest oak in England. The parish includes the hamlet of Letty Green to the west, with its grade II listed deconsecrated St John's Church. Domesday Book The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Hertfordingberie, meaning \\"Stronghold of the people of Hertford\\". St. Mary's Church, Hertingfordbury \\"Ralph himself holds Hertfordingberie. It is assessed at 5 hides. There is land for 10 ploughs. In demesne are 3 hides and 1 virgate, and there are 2 ploughs, and there can be a third. There 5 villans with 1 Frenchman and 6 bordars have 5 ploughs, and there can be 2 more. There are 11 cottars and 4 slaves, and 2 mills rendering 6s, meadow for 3 ploughs, pasture for the livestock of the vill and woodland for 200 pigs. From woodland pasture, 7s. In all it is worth ¬£8; when received, ¬£6; TRE ¬£10. Alwine, a thegn of Earl Harold, held this manor and could sell.The Domesday Book, 1086, Folio138v in the Hertford Hundred, Hertfordshire, Alecto Historical Editions. London 1991 St. Mary's Church St. Mary's Church is situated on rising ground to the east of the village, overlooking the water meadows that lead down to the River Mimram. A church seems to have stood on this spot as early as the 13th century. Construction is mainly of local flints with stone dressing, and the roof is tiled. Extensive alterations and restorations were carried out in 1845 and 1890. Inside the church is some interesting alabaster work, including the pulpit, and oak carvings by a native of Oberammergau. The churchyard contains the unmarked grave of Jane Wenham, erroneously believed to be the last person to be sentenced to death for witchcraft in England. She was condemned by a Hertford court in 1712 but was given a reprieve from the death sentence and later granted a Royal pardon by Queen Anne. Originally from Walkern her cause was adopted by William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper, and she lived out her days in a cottage on his land at Panshanger Park. Also buried in the churchyard are members of the Cowper family, and, under the yew tree by the west door, Benjamin Truman, owner of the Truman Brewery in the 18th Century, which was at one time the biggest brewery in the world.Hertingfordbury Parish News, May 2016 The Camden Town Group artist, Spencer Gore, whose mother lived in Hertingfordbury, was buried in the churchyard, after dying in Richmond. An American heiress, Pauline Payne Whitney, who had married Lord Queenborough, is buried there as is their daughter, Dorothy Paget, a racehorse owner, whose horses won the Cheltenham Gold Cup seven times and the Champion Hurdle four. Her funeral procession included a string of race horses, whose jockeys included Gordon Richards. Tennis at Hertingfordbury, by Spencer Gore The village Both Hertingfordbury Park, former residence of the Cowper family, and St Joseph's in the Park, a private primary school, stand to the east of St. Mary's. Houses in the village include \\"Epcombs\\", a Georgian brick house; \\"Amores\\", which stands in a triangle in the centre of the village and is over 500 years old; and \\"Roxford House\\" in St. Mary's Lane, which was the home of Austrian composer Joseph Haydn. The White Horse is a 15th-century Georgian- fronted building that in the past was a staging post for the Reading to Cambridge coach. To the north-east of the church is the Old Rectory, formerly home of the Addis family, descendants of William Addis, inventor of the first mass-produced toothbrush. There was an Addis brush factory in Hertford from 1920 to the 1990s. Mayflower Place was commissioned by Countess Cowper and built in 1910. It was originally for the workers and their families from the Panshanger Estate. It is now owned by the East Herts Lodge of Freemasons. A by-pass was constructed in 1974. Since then the village has changed in character and now provides homes for those who commute daily to London rather than for farm workers. Hertingfordbury was formerly served by Hertingfordbury railway station on the Hertford to Hatfield line. This was built for the Hertford & Welwyn Junction Railway and appeared in passenger timetables by 1858. Passenger services ceased in 1951 and the line eventually fell victim to the Beeching Axe when goods traffic ceased in 1966. The station was the setting for scenes in the 1936 film When Knights Were Bold, and an ITV children's TV programme, Catweazle in 1970. It has now been converted into a residence. The disused railway line is now the Cole Green Way, popular with walkers, riders and cyclists. Hertingfordbury Cricket Club plays at the recreation ground as does Hertingfordbury Tennis Club, which was formed at a public meeting in 1961. There is an annual fete on the third Saturday in June to raise funds for the upkeep of the recreation ground.

Goals  The survey will collect a representative sample of Chinese 45 and older every two years to enable multidisciplinary studies on issues related to population ageing. China is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world and accounts for a large fraction of the growth in the world's old. By 2050, China's elderly (65 and older) population share is expected to reach 30%.  Funding  The pilot survey is funded by the National Institute on Aging, the World Bank, and Natural Science Foundation of China.  Data Collection  The questionnaire contains information on household demographics, transfers among family members, health status, health care, employment, income, consumption and assets, as well as information on health facilities of the community and government policies in local areas. The CHARLS is designed on the models of health and retirement studies originated from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the U.S., but has the advantage of including information on the community the respondent resides and local policies. Due to large internal variations of government policies, the data will enable analyses of policy impacts in the process of population ageing. Other countries participating in this international network of ageing studies include England, fifteen countries in continental Europe, Israel, India, Korea, and Japan.  Initial Results  The pilot survey was conducted in two provinces (Zhejiang and Gansu) in 2008 and collected data on roughly 1,600 households. The pilot data of 2008 has been released to the research community since April 30, 2009. The national baseline survey is being planned for 2011. CHARLS data will be available for download by researchers at no cost.

Biography  Padilla was born in Murcia, the son of city attorney Antonio Marco Padilla and Manuela Ramos Alba from Beniel. He had five brothers. He studied under Teodulo Mabellini in Florence and appeared in many European countries, including England, where he sang in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Dinorah in 1881. He appeared at Covent Garden in 1887. He appeared in Prague that year in the centenary performance of Don Giovanni. He is perhaps best remembered as the man whom the Belgian soprano D√©sir√©e Art√¥t married, to the great surprise of her unofficial fianc√©, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Art√¥t had been performing in Russia in 1868, where she met and fell in love with Tchaikovsky. Her feelings were reciprocated, and they discussed marriage, although they were never formally engaged. Nevertheless, there was an understanding of sorts between them. She had to continue on her touring schedule and left for Warsaw, but they planned to meet again at her estate near Paris in the summer of 1869. However, without any warning or communication with Tchaikovsky (as the social conventions of the time would have demanded), Art√¥t married Padilla y Ramos - they were members of the same opera company - although she had earlier ridiculed him to Tchaikovsky, and he was seven years her junior (Tchaikovsky himself was five years her junior). The marriage occurred on 15 September 1869, either in S√®vres Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. (1954)Rupert Hughes, The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, Vol. 2 or Warsaw. Tchaikovsky ResearchJohn Warrack, TchaikovskyAlexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man Their daughter, the soprano Lola Art√¥t de Padilla, also became a noted opera singer. Mariano Padilla y Ramos died in Paris in November 1906, aged 63, just four months before D√©sir√©e Art√¥t died.

(in the Makapu ªu region) and the landfall for all traffic from the American west coast to Honolulu. With the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which began definite steps towards annexation, shipping interests began to clamor for a lighthouse at the point, beginning with an 1888 petition. In 1890 Lorrin A. Thurston, minister of the interior for the kingdom, directed that inquiries be made with a British firm for a lens and other equipment. The light remained stuck in the planning stage, however, until after annexation, and indeed until 1906, when the United States House of Representatives passed a bill with an appropriation for construction. The light from the hiking trail In the interim, the size of the planned optic grew considerably. Thurston's original request was met with a specification for a third-order Fresnel lens, but as time passed plans were upgraded to use a second-order, and then a first-order lens. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago (or \\"Chicago World's Fair\\"), the United States Lighthouse Board prominently displayed \\"its 'state of the art' wares and engineering achievements.\\" Prominently featured was \\"the engineering marvel\\" of Spectacle Reef Light and a skeletal cast iron lighthouse tower (reassembled as the Waackaack Rear Range Light off the shore of Keansburg, New Jersey, after the exposition). Also displayed were a number of Fresnel lenses, including a stunning third-order Fresnel lens that had been awarded first prize at a Paris glass exhibition. The lens featured alternating red and white panels, and had been ordered for installation in the Point Loma lighthouse in California. The coincidental conclusion of construction of the new Chicago Harbor Light and the close of the Exhibition prompted the Lighthouse Board to keep the lens in Chicago. The lens was installed in the lantern room of the new tower in Chicago, where it remained for nearly 100 years. Also displayed at the fair was a hyperradiant Fresnel lens ‚Äì the largest size ever made, \\"off the chart\\" of sixth through first Order. This lens was on hand when it was decided to build and outfit the Makapu ªu Point Light. Rather than order a new lens, the huge optic construction ‚Äì twelve feet tall and with over a thousand prisms ‚Äì would be used at the new Makapu ªu Point Light. Makapu ªu Point Light thereby became the only U.S. light with such a lens, and ever since its activation in 1909, it has had the distinction of having the largest lens in U.S. service. In addition to being the largest lens in the United States at the time of its construction, this was the second highest focal plane, after Cape Mendocino Light in California, which is at .Putnam, George R. (1916) The United States Lighthouse Service: 1915 (Washington D.C.: Government Printing Office) page 38. It is now the third highest light in the U.S., behind the Old Point Loma lighthouse and Cape Mendocino. It is still an active aid to navigation. Originally, the light was provided with a three-mantle oil vapor lamp. To start the lamp, a supplementary alcohol burner was required, and this was the source of a tragedy in 1925. The first and second assistant keepers were changing watches in the wee hours of April 25 when the former suggested to the latter that the alcohol reservoir be filled. This was accomplished, but some of the alcohol spilled. The first assistant lit a match, triggering an explosion. The second assistant was standing in the doorway and escaped serious injury, but the first assistant, Alexander Toomey, was badly burned and died the next day. His pregnant wife gave birth to a daughter shortly thereafter, and three months later she, too, died. Two years later the lighthouse was equipped with a radio beacon, the first in Hawaii. As this required a generating station, the lamp was changed from oil vapor to a 500W incandescent bulb. The light was automated in 1974, the radiobeacon having been discontinued the previous year. Shortly thereafter the lighthouse keeper's quarters were used to house witnesses in the federal tax evasion case of Wilford \\"Nappy\\" Pulawa. The isolated location left the buildings vulnerable to vandalism, including a 1984 incident in which a hole was shot in the lens. In 1987 the Coast Guard declared much of the land around the light surplus, and it was turned over to the State of Hawaii. One of the buildings was then seized by an armed group of native Hawaiians as part of a land ownership protest; after several weeks, however, the squatters were evicted without bloodshed, and buildings were razed. The light remains in control of the Coast Guard, surrounded by state-owned land; the trail leads to the light, and it is a popular destination for hikers. Makapuu-Lighthouse-Oahu-Hawaii The light is marked as white with red lantern. However, it used to be marked with a black lantern, and some sources erroneously indicate that as the present markings. The lighthouse sits high on a volcanic point. The rocky cliffs are popular with hang gliders.Makapuu Light. How Stuff Works.

Ryan began his tenure as Mayor under the old council/city manager system of government, in which the mayor was selected from among members of City Council to be that body's presiding officer. He first was voted to the post by his Council peers after the 1973 election which returned a Democratic majority to office. For his first decade as Mayor, a city manager appointed by City Council and accountable to that body handled the day to day administrative duties of government. This system had been in place since the late 1920s as a result of government reforms championed by the late industrial magnate George Eastman. However Ryan, who had exercised greater de facto influence over city policy than most of his predecessors under this system and functioned in many respects like a chief executive in policy matters, championed a change in the city charter to abolish the post of city manager and return to a \\"strong mayor\\" system like that in other major cities of New York State, in which the mayor was directly elected, directly accountable to voters and served as chief executive of city government. The charter change was approved by city voters and Ryan served as a \\"strong mayor\\" for two terms from 1985 through 1993 before retiring from public life. In addition to the revision in city government structure which began during his terms of office and continues in force today, Ryan became known for helping lead significant downtown redevelopment, and operating government on a fiscally conservative basis.

She is mainly remembered for her character roles on radio's weekly Let's Pretend.  Early years  Wolfe was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Belarusian and Ukrainian immigrant parents. She made her professional acting debut at age four, reciting poems and reading stories on The Uncle Gee Bee Kiddie Hour on WGBS, one of New York's first radio stations. When she was six years old, she was given the First Witch's part in a children's theater's production of Macbeth. Radio roles Although she had appeared earlier on The Children's Hour, Wolfe is best remembered for her diverse roles on Nila Mack's WCBS Saturday morning children's program, Let's Pretend. She joined the repertory acting company in 1934 and remained with the program well into her adult years, playing spooky witches, wicked and wise queens, good and bad spirits, kind and cruel mothers and stepmothers. At 12, Wolfe auditioned to succeed the 79-year-old Adelaide Fitz-Allen in the part of the ancient witch-narrator Old Nancy on Alonzo Deen Cole's The Witch's Tale (on the Mutual Broadcasting System). Cole, puzzled at first when he saw a young girl in a straw hat and Buster Brown haircut, hired her as soon as he heard the spine-chilling, cackling laugh which became her trademark. She played this part for five years, also doubling as other characters and leading women on the show. Later, Wolfe was heard regularly from New York and Hollywood on Fletcher Markle's Studio One and Ford Theater (CBS Network). There, she worked with actors such as Lucille Ball, Ingrid Bergman, Montgomery Clift and Marlene Dietrich. She was also heard on American School of the Air, Mystery Hall, Casey, Crime Photographer and Suspense. In the early 1940s, she directed and starred in numerous radio soap operas on WGR and WKBW in Buffalo. In the 1950s, Wolfe became a weekly regular on The Rayburn & Finch Comedy Hour and Popeye the Sailor (CBS Network), where she played both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag for several seasons. She was featured in the U.S. Army production of So Proudly We Hail!, starring film and stage actor Lee Tracy. In 1952, as a regular on the television version of Studio One, Wolfe played the Virgin Mary in Markle's television production of the medieval mystery play The Nativity, one of the few times that such a play has been presented on commercial network television. CBC In 1956, Wolfe moved to Canada and became active as a performer, writer and director with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). While at CBC she co-authored, produced, directed and played all the roles in the children's series, Miss Switch, and adapted, directed and played all the roles in a one-woman radio version of Paul Bowles' You Are Not I. She was also featured on many CBC commercials, comedy hours and dramas. For Canadian television, she performed featured, leading and starring roles on Wayne and Shuster, Ford Star Time, General Motors Presents and several other well-regarded programs. Films During her career, Wolfe worked as a scriptwriter, dubbed more than 50 films and cartoons, appeared in films and made recordings. Notable stage performances include the Broadway production of Make Momma Happy with Molly Picon, a Hollywood production of Tennessee Williams' The Rose Tattoo and a Toronto Crest Theatre production of Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness! She was elected a member of the Board of the Association of Canadian Television and Radio Actors (ACTRA) in 1958‚Äì59. In 1956, she married Canadian architect John Forrest Mackay Ross. The couple had a child and moved to Paris, where they resided from 1961 to 1980 and where she conducted a series of improvisational workshops. Upon her return to Toronto, Wolfe concentrated on writing and teaching, developing an original method of teaching the English language and its pronunciation, which later formed the basis of her book, Listening to Language: The Sounds of English. Wolfe also learned Blissymbolics, wrote teachers' guides and directed a weekly workshop for the Ontario Gifted Children's Program. She also worked with the Young People's Theatre. Her involvement with performance continued through her membership from 1981 to 1986 on the Board of the ACTRA Awards. On September 29, 2000, Wolfe died at her home in Toronto, of breast cancer. Awards In 1981, Wolfe received an award from Friends of Old Time Radio USA for her contribution to Radio's Golden Age.

It was published in the U.K. and Ireland on October 1, 2009, and worldwide on October 13, 2009. The novel is partly set in Hong Kong, where Bosch's daughter Maddie and ex- wife Eleanor Wish live. The main plot involves Maddie being kidnapped by a Chinese Triad (crime syndicate), which Bosch believes is due to his investigation of an L.A. murder, in which his primary suspect is a member of a triad that was shaking down the victim. As a result, Bosch heads to Hong Kong in an effort to rescue her.9 Dragons preview on Michael Connelly's web site. Referenced on 28 May 2009. The name of the most populated region of Hong Kong, Kowloon, means \\"nine dragons\\" in English. Plot Harry Bosch is still back in homicide (no closer duty for him) and during a slow night he is asked to investigate a shooting in a \\"rougher\\" section of L.A. Harry and his partner (Detective Ignacio Ferras) grudgingly take the assignment that would normally be handled by a gang-related crimes unit, and learn that a Chinese-American convenience store owner was murdered behind his own counter. The case draws Harry's interest because he remembers the store and that the owner had been kind to him several years earlier. He assures the owner's son, Robert Li, that he will catch the culprit. Harry starts to realize that this might not have been a routine robbery but a possible execution by a Triad hitman. With the help of Detective David Chu of the Asian Crimes Unit, Harry starts to zero in on a suspect and then receives a threatening call telling him to back off. Harry shrugs it off and continues but his investigation stalls when he receives a video showing his daughter (Maddie) being kidnapped in Hong Kong, which he believes to be related to the Triad and his murder investigation. He rushes off to save her, realizing that if he is not back within 48 hours, a suspect in the shooting will be set free. Because of the length of the flights, Harry will have less than 24 hours in Hong Kong to find Maddie. During a tense plane ride to Hong Kong, Harry feels powerless because there is nothing he can do in the air. When he gets to Hong Kong, he is aided by Maddie's mother, his ex-wife Eleanor Wish, and her Chinese boyfriend. Harry has limited clues but through very good forensic science, he is able to determine where to look for Maddie ‚Äì however, during the search, Eleanor is killed by thieves. Despite that, Harry and her boyfriend continue to race to find Maddie because any delay could mean that she might already be dead or shipped into slavery by the Triad. Harry rescues her from the Triad in the nick of time and takes her to L.A. After his departure, the Chinese government sends officers to L.A. to extradite Harry for his violations of Chinese law in his search for Maddie, but Harry's half-brother, lawyer Mickey Haller, forces the Chinese to drop this attempt. However, Harry and Chu determine, through other forensic evidence, that there is no connection between Maddie's kidnapping and his murder investigation. Instead, the murder evidence points to Robert Li, the son of the victim, and his best friend Eugene Lam. Bosch and Chu arrest Lam, whom they believe to be the killer, while leaving Ferras to follow Robert Li. Lam reveals that the entire murder was a plot concocted by Mia Li, the victim's daughter, to relieve her of the burden of her parents; Robert had come up with the idea of disguising it as a Triad killing. When Bosch and Chu inform Ferras, he decides to single-handedly arrest Robert Li as an act of defiance against Bosch, but he is killed by Mia during the arrest. Mia then commits suicide. After Ferras' funeral, Maddie confesses to Harry that the \\"kidnapping\\" was originally a fake that she planned with \\"Quick\\", a Chinese friend, to get her mother to agree to let her live with Harry. However, when presented with the opportunity, Quick turned it into a real kidnapping, making the deal with the Triad from which Harry saved her. Maddie blames herself for the deaths that followed. Harry consoles her, promising to show her how they can make up for their mistakes.

An accomplished physician and soldier from the state of West Virginia, he was killed in action in the Shenandoah Valley at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Early life and career Joseph Thoburn was the son of Matthew and Jane Lyle (Crawford) Thoburn. He was born in 1825, in County Antrim in northern Ireland. That autumn, his father emigrated to Canada. In 1826, the family moved south to the United States and settled on a farm near St. Clairsville, Ohio, in rural Belmont County.Newton, Nichols, and Sprankle, p. 253. He was educated at the local school, and developed a love for books at an early age. As a young man, he taught school for several years before becoming a medical student, studying under Dr. Ephraim Gaston, of Morristown, Ohio. He subsequently attended Starling Medical College in Columbus, Ohio. He relocated in 1849 to Brownsville, Pennsylvania, where he briefly partnered in a medical practice before resigning to accept an appointment in Columbus at the Ohio Lunatic Asylum as an assistant to the chief physician. Because of political influences, he was displaced in 1853 and moved to Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), where he formed a private medical practice that flourished in the late 1850s.Brant & Fuller, pp. 580-81. He married Catherine \\"Kate\\" Ann Mitchell December 13, 1853, in Martins Ferry, Ohio. The couple would have three children, a son and two daughters.Civil War Army Pension Files, State of West Virginia. Civil War service After the bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor in April 1861, the following month Thoburn enlisted as the surgeon of the 1st Virginia Infantry, a three-months regiment under Col. Benjamin F. Kelley. He accompanied his regiment in the Battle of Philippi, where his patients included a wounded Colonel Kelley. In August 1861, the regiment was mustered out of service. Most of the men reenlisted in the reorganized 1st Virginia Infantry, a three-years regiment. With Kelley still out with his wound, Thoburn was commissioned as the colonel of the regiment. He led the command in numerous small battles and engagements in what became West Virginia and also in the Shenandoah Valley in 1862 and 1863. The following year, he assumed command of a division in the VIII Corps and fought in the Valley Campaigns of 1864 in the army of Philip Sheridan. During the Battle of Opequon or Third Winchester, as the XIX Corps was reorganizing its lines, Thoburn's division came up from reserve and took position at the edge of a woods. Sheridan soon arrived and directed Thoburn to move forward as soon as the other division of the Eighth Corps was ready. About 3 p.m. \\"a mighty battle yell,\\" from the other side of Red Bud Run announced the arrival of those troops. The Union lines advanced, and, as one participant recalled, \\"For thirty minutes the battle that ensued was perfectly terrific, but then the forces in our front gave way, and in an instant we were over their works, and after them with yells and shouts of victory.\\"National Park Service Third Battle of Winchester wayside marker Death and legacy On October 19, 1864, Joseph Thoburn was killed in action during the Battle of Cedar Creek, a Union victory. His corps commander, Maj. Gen. George Crook, reported, \\"I am pained to report the death of Col. Joseph Thoburn, commanding First Division, and Capt. Philip G. Bier, assistant adjutant-general on my staff. Both fell mortally wounded while rallying the men. Brave, efficient, and ever conspicuous for their gallantry on the field of battle, in them the country sustained a loss not easily repaired.\\"Official Records, Vol. 43, pp. 365-66. A biographer later wrote, \\"Dr. Thoburn was greatly beloved by his brother officers and men, as a man full of kindness and benevolence, and of undoubted bravery and patriotism. As a physician, he possessed very clever attainments, with a high sense of professional honor.\\" Thoburn's body was taken to Wheeling for a large public funeral. It was taken with a military escort to Mt. Wood Cemetery with a public procession including city officers, council, medical faculty, military escort and many citizens. His widow died in 1886 and was buried beside him. See also References * Brant & Fuller, History of the Upper Ohio Valley, Vol. I, 1890. * Newton, J.H., G. C. Nichols, and A. G.

She was raised in San Francisco, and now lives in Salt Lake City, Utah with her husband. Her first novel, Story of a Girl, was a 2007 National Book Award finalist. She has subsequently had six novels published. Biography and Career Born in Cleveland, Ohio and raised in San Francisco, she earned a degree in communications from San Francisco State University. Zarr grew up as part of a Jesus Movement church and still identifies as a Christian. Her first three manuscripts were never published, but after winning the Utah Arts Council prize for best unpublished young adult novel of 2003, she was able to find an agent who successfully sold Story of a Girl as the first of a two-book deal, to Little, Brown Books for Young Readers. Inspired by the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart and Zarr's Christian roots, her third book, Once Was Lost (also published as What We Lost) addresses issues of faith, identity and home. The original title comes from the hymn Amazing Grace written by John Newton. While the characters are Christian, the book was published for a mainstream audience and neither promotes nor criticizes organized religion. In 2008, Zarr contributed to the young adult for Obama project started by fellow YA author Maureen Johnson. Zarr's articles included \\"Red State Jesus Freaks for Obama\\" and \\"Personal Sacrifice.\\" Zarr has been a regular contributor to Image Journal's Good Letters blog. In 2010, she served as a judge for the National Book Awards. From 2013-2015, Zarr taught at Lesley University‚Äôs Low-Residency Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program. From 2012-2015, Zarr hosted and produced the podcast This Creative Life. It featured Zarr in conversation with other writers.

Ecclesiastical history The first church on the site was built in the 11th century. In 1170 it was the venue for the marriage of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (\\"Strongbow\\"), and Aoife N√≠ Diarmait. This was replaced in 1210 by a Gothic Cathedral.\\"The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland\\" Day, J.G.F./ Patton, H.E. p125: London, S.P.C.K., 1932 Since Christ Church Cathedral was subject to the Protestant Reformation, Roman Catholic adherents were consequently obliged to worship elsewhere. In the 18th century, the city corporation recommended that the bishop erect a new building. The architect was John Roberts, who was responsible also for the Catholic cathedral and for much of Georgian Waterford. During the demolition of the old cathedral, a series of medieval vestments were discovered in 1773. They were presented by the then Anglican bishop, the Rt Revd Richard Chenevix, to his Roman Catholic counterpart, the Most Revd Peter Creagh, and are now kept in the Museum of Treasures in Waterford and the National Museum in Dublin. The present building has been described by architectural historian Mark Girouard as the finest 18th century ecclesiastical building in Ireland.

Almost the entire city had been destroyed. The Palaces in Darbhanga also suffered major damage. Moti Mahal Palace was entirely destroyed in earthquake.

It is probably the first building in India to incorporate earthquake resistant technology.  Architectural Style  The palace is a simple looking building with no outstanding features. The thrust being on building's ability to withstand major earthquake, no unnecessary features to beautify the building were added. A first time visitor, expecting to see a beautiful looking Palace, would be greatly disappointed in looking at a plain but massive building.

Participation for both employers and employees is compulsory. The Uganda National Social Security Fund is the largest pension fund in the countries of the East African Community, with assets of USh11.5 trillion (approx. US$3.115 billion), as of November 2019. History In February 2009, the President of Uganda fired the minister of finance, whose ministry supervises the activities of NSSF. Also terminated were the managing director of the NSSF and his deputy. A new board of directors and a new management team were appointed in 2009. In late 2010, NSSF underwent a restructuring process aimed at making it more efficient, competitive, and responsive to the needs of its members. It was then poised to provide a wide range of social security products and be the lead institution for domestic capital formation and deepening the financial sector. Analysts in the country said in 2013 that the NSSF had become a leading player in the country's economy. Investment portfolio In July 2018, the fund's investments included (a) fixed income investments, accounting for 77 percent of all investments (b) equities on the security exchanges of the East African countries, accounting for 17 percent and (c) real estate investments, which are 6 percent of the total portfolio. Significant real estate holdings include Workers' House in the centre of Kampala, Uganda's capital city, where NSSF maintains its head office, and City House Jinja, in Jinja, developed between 2015 and 2018, at a cost of USh3.5 billion (approx. US$1 million).

The total contribution is equal to 15 percent of an employee's gross salary, with the employer contributing 10 percent and the employee 5 percent. The NSSF pays five types of benefits: * Age benefit - paid to a member who has reached the retirement age of 55 * Withdrawal benefit: Paid to a member who has reached the age of 50 and is out of regular employment for one year * Invalidity benefit: Paid to a member who has become incapable of gainful employment * Survivor's benefit: Paid to the dependent survivor of a member * Emigration grant: Paid to a member who is leaving Uganda permanently. The NSSF's total assets as of 30 June 2014, were valued at UGX:4.4 trillion. In October 2017, The Independent, a Ugandan English language newspaper, estimated the NSSF total assets at USh7.9 trillion (approximately US$2.48 billion at that time), as of 30 June 2017.

Recently small scale commercial stump harvesting has started in parts of Scotland to provide fuel for biomass power stations. In Finland, stumps were at one time used to produce tar and charcoal. In the 1970s, a number of trials were set up in Finland to examine the viability of stump harvesting for woody biomass, but it is only in recent years that it has developed into a large scale commercial operation.

History  The church stands on the left bank of the Kwanza River, and is a contemporary of the Fortress of C\`Muxima' 7. The village of Muxirna was occupied by the Portuguese in 1589 and ten years later (1599), the Fortress was founded and the church was built with a prayer invoking divine blessing from \\"Nossa Senhora da Muxirna\\". Muxima was an important empire of slave traffic, protected by the Fortress, and the church played an important role in the materialization of the traffic, because it was in this religious local, where the slaves were baptized before being deported. Architecture It is spacious and strong building, with a stern, typically Portuguese architecture, built above the Kwanza River. It was set on fire by the colonial Dutch in 1641, when they captured Muxima. Later, it was modified. The sanctuary, with a Virgin image, has been a place of great devotion for Christian pilgrims for generations. It was classified as National Monument by Portuguese Provincial Decree No. 2, on 12 January 1924. It is relatively in good order and belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. The responsibility for its maintenance and preservation concerns the Ministry of Culture.

In the U.K. edition the narrator is uncredited. Overview The 51 episodes of the series were produced by Nugus/Martin Productions Ltd. in 2001. The show was aired on The History Channel in both the U.K. and U.S. In the U.S. the show was included as part of the 154-episode run of History's Mysteries. During the hour long show, two episodes of Infamous Murders were presented together. Each episode was thirty minutes long. Three crimes that share a common theme such as motive, means, or victims are given ten minutes of time apiece. The series concentrated on notorious murders carried out during the 20th century. In the beginning of each show a particularly infamous crime would be examined as an example. The words ‚ÄúInfamous Murders now examines‚Ä¶‚Äù would follow and the other three murders would be presented. The series relied on historical documents for visuals rather than reenactments. Dramatic music was used to heighten the narration along with rostrum shots of photographs, and vintage television/film footage. Reruns of the show could be seen on The History Channel, the Crime & Investigation Network, Biography Channel, and History International. After History International became H2 in 2011, the rights to the series were discontinued. A 17 disc DVD version of the series was released in the U.K. as Ultimate Crimes: The World‚Äôs Most Infamous Murders by Odeon Entertainment in 2002. Each disc contains three episodes.

Published 1908 in Leipzig. Emanuel Goldberg (; ; ) (born: 31 August 1881; died: 13 September 1970) was an Israeli physicist and inventor. He was born in Moscow and moved first to Germany and later to Israel. He described himself as ‚Äúa chemist by learning, physicist by calling, and a mechanic by birth.‚Äù He contributed a wide range of theoretic and practical advances relating to light and media and was the founding head of Zeiss Ikon, the famous photographic products company in Dresden, Germany. His inventions include microdots, the Kinamo movie camera, the Contax 35 mm camera, a very early search engine, and equipment for sensitometry.  Biography  Goldberg was born in Moscow on 31 August 1881 (19 August 1881 in the Old Style, Julian calendar, sometimes given in error as 1 September) the son of Grigorii Ignat‚Äôevich Goldberg, a distinguished Colonel (Polkovnik) in the Tsar‚Äôs military medical corps and his wife Olga Moiseevna Grodsenka. Earlier interested in engineering, he studied Chemistry at the University of Moscow and at several German universities, and remained in Germany after 1904 to avoid antisemitism in Russia. In 1906 he received a Ph.D from the University of Leipzig for research at the Institute for Physical Chemistry, led by Wilhelm Ostwald on the kinetics of photochemical reactions. After a year as assistant to Adolf Miethe in the Photochemistry Laboratory at the Technical University in Charlottenburg, Berlin, he became head of the photographic department of the Royal Academy of Graphic Arts and Bookcraft, in Leipzig from 1907 to 1917. In 1917 Goldberg was recruited by the Carl Zeiss Stiftung to become a director of its photographic products subsidiary Ica (Internationale Camera Aktien Gesellschaft)cf. Internationale Camera Actiengesellschaft (German) in Dresden where he introduced the spring-driven Kinamo movie camera. In 1926 a ‚ÄúFusion‚Äù of four leading photographic firms (Contessa, Ernemann, Ica and Goerz) formed Zeiss Ikon under Goldberg‚Äôs leadership until he was kidnapped by Nazis in 1933 and fled to Paris. After four years working for Zeiss subsidiaries in France, Goldberg moved to Palestine in 1937 where he established a laboratory, later called Goldberg Instruments, which became the Electro-Optical Industries (‚ÄúEl- Op‚Äù) in Rehovot. A photograph taken 1943 by John Phillips for Life Magazine shows Goldberg in his workshop in Palestine.Dr. Emanuel Goldberg in his workshop (Palestine, 1943) He retired in 1960 but continued his research and died in Tel Aviv on 13 September 1970.  Early inventions  Goldberg patented improved methods for electroplating zinc on iron in 1902 and published numerous technical papers on improved printing techniques, reducing moir√© effects in half-tone printing, photoengraving and other topics. In 1910 he became well known for an improved method for making neutral gelatin wedges (\\"Goldberg wedge\\") that was widely used in sensitometry and the , an instrument that greatly reduced the labor required to measure the characteristic curves of photographic emulsions. At Ica, foreseeing a growing market in amateur and semi-professional movies, he designed an extremely compact 35 mm movie camera, the Kinamo, introduced in 1921 with a spring motor attachment added in 1923 to allow flexible handheld filming. Goldberg made films of himself and his family as promotional shorts and, in 1927, a skiing drama, ‚ÄúEin Sprung . . . Ein Traum.‚Äù The Kinamo was used by Joris Ivens and other avant-garde and documentary filmmakers in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1925 Goldberg demonstrated and published a technique for making microdot (Mikrat nach Goldberg) at a resolution equivalent to the text 50 complete Bibles per square inch. This invention has been widely attributed to a mythical ‚ÄúProfessor Zapp‚Äù based on J. Edgar Hoover‚Äôs erroneous article in the April 1946 Readers Digest, probably a confusion with Kurt Zapp who trained German spies in microdot photography during the Second World War. In 1937, Goldberg presented a paper at the World Congress of Universal Documentation on an early copying camera he had invented. At Ica and Zeiss Ikon Goldberg was involved in many innovations and led the design of famous Contax 35 mm still camera. Goldberg was best known for his extensive studies in sensitometry summarized in his book Der Aufbau des photographisches Bildes (1922) and the ‚ÄúGoldberg Condition‚Äù (Goldberg Bedingung), a design principle for high quality reproduction in two stage, negative-positive photographic processes better known in English as ‚Äúthe gamma rule.‚Äù Goldberg and his former teacher and collaborator were instrumental in the acceptance at the International Congress of Photography in Dresden in 1931 of the widely adopted German national film speed standard DIN 4512. At the same Congress Goldberg introduced his ‚ÄúStatistical Machine,‚Äù a document search engine that used photoelectric cells and pattern recognition to search the metadata on rolls of microfilmed documents (US patent 1,838,389, 29 December 1931). This technology was used in a variant form in 1938 by Vannevar Bush in his ‚Äúmicrofilm rapid selector,‚Äù his ‚Äúcomparator‚Äù (for cryptanalysis), and was the technological basis for the imaginary Memex in Bush‚Äôs influential 1945 essay ‚ÄúAs we may think.‚Äù  Educational and service activities  In Germany Goldberg was noted for his educational displays at exhibitions, served as consultant on aerial photography in the First World War, and was a consultant to the Carl Zeiss firm in Jena. In Palestine and later Israel he was deeply engaged as an advisory to both civilian and military spheres. The apprenticeship scheme that he introduced in Tel Aviv provided advanced technical skills to many who went on to develop the Israeli high tech industry.  Awards  In 1968, Goldberg was awarded the Israel Prize, in exact science.  Personal life  On 28 June 1907 Goldberg married Sophie Posniak (28 August 1886 - 10 December 1968). They had a son, Herbert Goldberg (b. 20 November 1914) and a daughter Renate Eva, who later changed her name to Chava (b. 19 September 1922). Chava married Mordechai Gichon in 1948. In 1990 Chava Gichon (Tel-Aviv) requested restitution of the property in the Oeserstra√üe 5 in Dresden, which Goldberg as director of Zeiss-Ikon had bought in 1927, but the real estate office did not approve an intended agreement with the owner at that time in August 1995.Peter B√∂lke: Erbschein aus dem KZ.

She lost her bid for election in the 2010 Democratic primary to Chip Flowers. She is currently the Wilmington City Treasurer. Early life and career Jones-Potter attended P. S. Dupont High School. She was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Delaware with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering. Jones-Potter obtained her MBA from Indiana University. She worked for DuPont for 17 years and served as an executive vice president for MBNA. Political career When Jack Markell was elected governor in 2008, he appointed Jones- Potter to finish out his term as Delaware State Treasurer. She became the first African American to hold statewide office in Delaware. She ran for election to the position in 2010 as the incumbent but lost in the Democratic primary to Chip Flowers, who won with 54 percent over Jones-Potter and went on to win the general election against Republican Colin Bonini. During the campaign, she faced scrutiny for receiving over $100,000 in consulting fees by the City of Wilmington between 2007 and 2010. In 2016, Jones-Potter won the three-way Democratic primary for Wilmington City Treasurer with 40 percent against Darius J. Brown and Kenneth Matlusky. She was elected unopposed in the general election. By winning this election, Jones-Potter became the first African-American woman to serve as the Wilmington City Treasurer. In 2018, The News Journal reported that she had sought a raise of $21,647, or nearly 20 percent over her current salary of $113,933, as well as raises for her appointees in the treasury department. Legal controversies In 2017, Jones- Potter and her husband, Charles Potter Jr., were at risk of losing their home to a sheriff's sale as a result of \\"ongoing litigation stemming from home repairs.\\" A Delaware Superior Court judge rejected all of the couple's complaints after finding them liable for failing to pay a construction contractor over $60,000 and criticized their \\"kitchen sink\\" tactics in the litigation. The Delaware Supreme Court rejected two appeals by the couple, and upheld a judgement of $116,000, plus interest, against them in 2018. In 2018, the Delaware Superior Court rejected an attempt by the Potters to force the City of Wilmington's Licenses and Inspections Department to hold the contractor liable for code violations. The judge ruled that the couple cannot use the city to obtain compensation for losing their earlier legal disputes and criticized their use of the courts as spiteful. The Potters' appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court was rejected in 2019.

The lone aircraft was built in Leeds, UK in 1910. Development The First Monoplane was not a success, barely leaving the ground before crashing. His second machine, the Second Monoplane was very different, and resembled L√©on Levavasseur's Antoinette design which Blackburn had seen in France. The monoplane wing was rectangular with a constant chord, significant dihedral and square tips, and had a thin aerofoil section cambered on the underside, as was usual at the time. Lateral control was by wing warping. The wing was wire braced via a kingpost passing through the fuselage, extending both above and below. The fuselage was, like the wings, a wooden structure covered with fabric, triangular in section and tapering towards the tail. This was characteristically Antoinette with a long, finely tapering fin and tailplane, the rudder being divided into two triangular sections above and below the elevator, giving it clearance to move. The pilot's seat was at the trailing edge of the wing, and contained Blackburn's \\"triple steering column\\" which was moved up and down for elevator control, from side to side to warp the wings and rotated to move the rudders. This system had been used on the First Monoplane. The undercarriage main axle was carried at the bottom end of the kingpost with wheels at either end and bearing ash fore and aft skids. During development and taxying trials, this structure was braced and sprung in different ways before the undercarriage was deemed satisfactory. Flying was delayed by the choice of a new untried engine, a seven-cylinder radial designed by R.J.Issacson of the Hunslet Engine Co. of Leeds. This drove a wooden two-blade propeller via a 2:1 reduction gear. The aircraft was taken to Filey on the English east coast for testing on the sands with B.C.Hucks at the controls. On 8 March 1911, after taxying for several miles, he made the first takeoff. He flew successfully for a while at about 30 ft (10 m) and 50 mph (80 km/h), but he sideslipped into the sands when attempting his first turn. Despite this mishap, after repair the Second Monoplane did good service at Filey as an instructional aircraft, bringing publicity to Blackburn's name and later machines.

He previously worked as a banker in the 1980s and served as a politician known for his appointments involving civil rights.  Early life and education  J. Stanley Pottinger was born in 1940 in Dayton Ohio, to parents Elnora and John Pottinger. He grew up and attended high school in Dayton. Pottinger credits his father John with instilling an awareness of civil rights. In 1962, Pottinger graduated from Harvard University. He continued his studies at Harvard and graduated with a JD from Harvard Law School in 1965. Pottinger's interest in politics led him to volunteer in 1966 to aid the campaign of Robert H. Finch for lieutenant governor of California. Finch asked him in 1968 to head the Civil Rights Division.  Career  Pottinger held significant roles as a bureaucratic appointee in the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations. From 1970 to 1973, he held the position of the Director of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare from 1970 to 1973 and later served as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the United States Department of Justice from 1973 to 1977. According to Bob Woodward, Pottinger was the only person who discovered that the true identity of Watergate source Deep Throat was Mark Felt.

The company acquired a hair-coloring line through the acquisition of a competitor business. Later the retailer diversified into the field of personal care products, manufacturing Degree, among other items.\\"Mennen Puts Toiletries Firm On The Block\\", The Wall Street Journal, November 12, 1991, pg. 3. Corporation history Helene Curtis was founded in Chicago in 1927 as the National Mineral Company by partners Gerald Gidwitz and Louis Stein. The company began by manufacturing a facial mudpack product, sold to beauty salons nationwide. The partners soon shifted the company's emphasis to haircare products (also sold to beauty salons), starting with a line of \\"machineless\\" waving pads, drastically simplifying the permanent wave process. The company developed Lanolin Creme Shampoo, one of the country's first detergent-based shampoos, in the mid-1930's. The popularity of the shampoo, available only in beauty salons, prompted the company to follow it up with Suave Hairdressing in 1937. The demand for the hair tonic became so great that the company began manufacturing small retail sizes for salon resale. Suave would eventually become one of the company's flagship product lines. During World War II, the company's name changed to National Industries, Inc., and factories were converted to manufacture non-haircare-related items for the war effort, including aircraft gun turrets, electric motors and radar equipment. After the war, National Industries shifted back to producing personal care products. The company was renamed Helene Curtis, after the first names of partner Louis Stein's wife and son. Suave Hairdressing and Lanolin Creme Shampoo were soon introduced for general retail sale, and quickly began outselling the competition. In March 1948, Kraft Foods purchased property owned by the company to use for its offices and warehouses,\\"Kraft Foods Buys Chicago Property of Helene Curtis\\", The Wall Street Journal, March 16, 1948, pg. 4. and Helene Curtis relocated to a new corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility. In 1949 Helene Curtis developed the generic term \\"hairspray\\" for its new aerosol product, Spraynet. Other successful and effective products introduced during the 1950's included the spray-on deodorant Stopette (acquired in 1958 from its founder, Chicago-based chemist and inventor Jules Montenier) and a nonprescription dandruff shampoo called Enden. These two products were advertised on television during such shows as What's My Line? and The Gale Storm Show, helping to make Stopette the best selling deodorant on the market, a position it maintained for several years. The company expanded its product line with several acquisitions, including Kings Men male toiletries, Lentheric fragrances, and Studio Girl cosmetics. By the mid-1950's, Helene Curtis products were being manufactured and sold in 25 countries. In 1956, Helene Curtis went public after 32 years of private ownership (although the Gidwitz family held most of the voting shares until the company's 1996 takeover by Unilever). In the early 1960's the company began to build on the success of its Suave brand, introducing shampoos, creme rinses, and wave sets. In 1961 Helene Curtis's stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and by the middle of the decade the company had licensed its products in 81 countries. Also in 1961, Helene Curtis Industries began to challenge Avon in the field of door-to-door cosmetics sales.\\"Brawl Over Beauty\\", The Wall Street Journal, August 21, 1961, pg. 1. Ronald J. Gidwitz, son of co-founder Gerald Gidwitz, took over as CEO in 1985. In the 1970s and 1980s, Suave shampoo was one of the best selling in America, due largely to an effective advertising campaign touting Suave's similar quality, but much lower price, when compared to more expensive salon and name brands. As a result of this success, Suave's personal care lines was extended into deodorants, skin creams and other products. the company followed up by introducing the equally successful line of Finesse and (the professional-caliber) Salon Selectives brands. By 1989, Suave, Finesse and Salon Selectives were among the top ten national shampoo brands. In 1990 Helene Curtis introduced the Degree antiperspirant, at that time the company's most successful new product launch. With a formula activated as body heat rises, and aided by a $50 million advertising campaign, Degree quickly found a large share of the market, achieving the company's market share goal for the brand's first year in only eight months. By the end of fiscal 1992 Helene Curtis had attained the billion dollar mark with total sales of $1.02 billion. As the decade of the 1990s progressed, despite its best efforts, record sales, facilities expansion, and advertising budgets approaching $80 million and up, it became clear that Helene Curtis was too small compared to its larger rivals. The firm did not have the resources to compete on an international scale with the likes of Procter & Gamble and Unilever. In February 1996, Helene Curtis agreed to be acquired by Unilever for about $770 million. In contract law, the company is known for the 1963 case Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. United States, in which the Superior knowledge doctrine was born. In 1998, the beauty manufacturer had a production site in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.\\"It's The Hair, Stupid\\", The New York Times, November 1, 1998, pg.

Using statistical (event-based) profiling, this software diagnoses performance problems related to cpu- and memory-intensive program code. Unfortunately development ended on this product in 2015.  Statistical Sampling  Statistical sampling is the periodic recording of a processor's program counter or instruction pointer. * Each sample is taken (triggered) after a fixed period of time has elapsed or set number of events has occurred. In this way samples are taken in code proportionate to where more time is spent or more events occur. * Statistical sampling can be either system-wide or target a specific process. System-wide sampling captures all of the processes running on a system, and can include time spent in kernel or driver code as well. Process-targeted sampling can be used to understand time spent waiting for I/O or kernel work. * Additional information besides the program counter can be recorded at each interval. For example, other hardware performance counters can be read or the entire function callstack can be recorded. Recording the stack is important because it allows the developer to know not only where time was spent (or events occurred), but also how that code was called.  Call Tree Visualization  Symbol information is used to map program addresses to symbol names. Breaking down a profile at symbol granularity is a useful way to understand the time spent in blocks of code. There are a variety of methods for summarizing the information in a set of samples that include backtraces of each sample's call stack: * Top-down (tree) visualization is used to find \\"hot\\" (frequently sampled) call paths, starting at the root symbol (e.g. main). * Bottom-up (leaf) visualization is used to find \\"hot\\" code, starting in the symbols where samples occurred. * Hotspot visualization is a complete list of symbols encountered in the profile that is used in conjunction with a side-by-side tree and leaf views (butterfly view). Selecting a symbol in the hotspot list shows the callers and callees of that symbol in the butterfly view.  Code visualization  Code visualization enables the developer to correlate source code to machine instructions. It also allows for each line of source or instruction to be annotated with performance data. * Debug information such as DWARF can be used to map program addresses back to source code. This is the same information used by debuggers such as gdb.  Code Analysis Engine  A code analysis engine parses source or assembly code to provide tuning advice for specific processors and architectures.

It is also referred to as sang () or gun () in hanja in the Korean language.  History  Basic forms of ancient Chima date back to the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BC-668 AD). The chima is one element of hanbok, which is Korean traditional clothing. It is most commonly worn with the jeogori. While hanbok has evolved overtime, the chima has remained relatively unchanged throughout time. Later on in the Goguryeo Kingdom, the jeogori became shorter and shorter, showing off more of the chima. The use of primary colors in hanbok and more specifically in chima, led to the Korean people often being nicknamed ‚Äúthe white people‚Äù. Different colors and lengths indicated important social distinctions such as: age, marital status, and class.  Silhouette  Chima is a floor length wrap around skirt with a wide waistband positioned above the chest. With the high placement of the waistband it allows the skirt to have a more billowy look, which can give greater freedom of movement. Traditionally, women needed to wear about five to seven layers of undergarments which consisted of pants and underskirts, this made the skirt look more voluminous and provide a more elegant look. However, modern women usually wear one layer of undergarment typically pants. There are different kinds of Chima: single-layered, double-layered, and quilted. Furthermore, Pul-chima refers to a chima with a separated back, whereas a tong-chima has a seamed back. The upper class usually use Ramie as the fabric to make for summer chimas while plain and patterned silks are used throughout the remainder of the year. By contrast, commoners were restricted to using cotton for their chimas. Women in the upper class wore a long chima which falls down to the floor while women in the lower class wore a shorter chima which length reaches to the calf of the leg. Korean noblewomen wore full length chima to designate their social status.  Color  Girls and unmarried women usually wore red skirts, while married women and middle-aged women wore blue skirts and elderly women wore gray skirts. In addition, Goguryeo women also wore saekdong chima that is a colorfully striped skirt by patchworking, and a chima in form of gored skirt, made by sewing several pieces of fabric without gathering.[3] See also *Chima jeogori *Baji (clothing) *Dangui *Wonsam *Hwarot References Category:Korean clothing Category:Skirts ","title":"Chima (clothing)"},{"id":"21612287","text":"The Grande Prairie Public Library serves the communities of Hazel Crest, Illinois and Country Club Hills, Illinois. It is located at 3479 W. 183rd Street in Hazel Crest, in the south suburbs of Chicago. The library is a member of the Metropolitan Library System.  Early history of the Hazel Crest Library  The original Hazel Crest Library was established in 1930 by the Professional Women's Club and housed in a room in the Roosevelt School. The library was staffed by volunteers. When the school was renovated and renamed the Warren Palm School in 1931, the library moved into a portable building on the school grounds. When the Warren Palm School continued its expansion in 1951, the library lost its space and discontinued service. The remaining books were donated to the school.  Early history of the Country Club Hills Library  The original Country Club Hills Public Library, established in 1960, consisted of donated books and was located in one room of the old city hall building. In 1964, the library moved into the newly built Civic Center and expanded its space in 1966. The first full-time professional librarian was hired in 1973.  History of the Grande Prairie Public Library  In September 1974, the city of Country Club Hills passed a referendum to establish the Country Club Hills Library District. The following year, the city of Hazel Crest was annexed to the district. In 1978, the library moved into a temporary space in the Stonebridge Shopping Center in Hazel Crest. In May 1977, the name of the library district was changed to Grande Prairie Public Library District to better reflect the heritage of both communities. In September 1979, residents of Hazel Crest and Country Club Hills approved a $1.1 million bond for the construction of a new library building. The building at 3479 W. 183rd Street, designed by the architectural firm Holabird & Root (originally Holabird & Roche), opened to the public on April 12, 1982.  Floor plan of the library  The two-story building houses adult materials upstairs, including fiction and non-fiction, periodicals, DVDs, VHS cassettes, CDs, and Audiobooks on CD and cassette. Also located upstairs are ten, public-access internet computers (managed by reservation), three online catalogs, and black/white printing and copying capabilities. Downstairs, the library houses youth materials, including a variety similar to the adult materials. The youth department hosts five filtered internet computers and three online catalogs. Also located downstairs are the library's large meeting and small conference rooms, along with a color copier and an additional black/white copier. Family restrooms are located on each floor. An elevator is available to serve patrons and staff.  References  *Hansen, Eileen, ed., (1976). From Cooper's Grove to Country Club Hills. Suburban Library System. *Ragan, Lawrence, ed., (1962).

Smith earned a Bachelor's degree in Sacred Theology (1961) and a doctorate in canon law (1966) from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He was also a visiting professor of pastoral theology at his alma mater of the Immaculate Conception Seminary, an elected representative on the Archdiocesan Council of Priests, and dean of central Bergen County. Smith was raised to the rank of Papal Chamberlain by Pope Paul VI in 1971, and assigned to the team ministry of St. Joseph Church in Oradell in 1973.

Upon his return to the United States in 1986, he was named pastor of St. Mary's Church in Dumont and later vicar general and moderator of the curia. Episcopal career Titular Bishop of Tres Tabernae and Auxiliary Bishop of Newark On November 20, 1987, Smith was appointed Titular Bishop of Tres Tabernae and Auxiliary Bishop of Newark by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1988 from Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, with Archbishop Peter Gerety and Bishop Walter Curtis serving as co- consecrators.http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bsmith.htm Bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee Smith was later named the third Bishop of Pensacola- Tallahassee, Florida, on June 25, 1991.

He is the author of 28 books, most of them related to country music; they include biographies of performers like Eddy Arnold, Roger Miller, Merle Haggard and Gene Autry. He is a special correspondent for Billboard magazine, a book reviewer for MusicRow magazine, and editor for trade magazines Record World and Cashbox . Cusic was a consultant for Ken Burns' documentary miniseries Country Music. He is a Curb Professor of Music Industry History at Belmont University in Nashville, where his former students include Brad Paisley and Chris Young. He is a frequent contributor of liner notes for prominent recording artists and has contributed various encyclopedia entries, magazine articles, and book chapters. Early life Cusic was born in the southern Maryland town of Leonardtown, the county seat of St. Mary's County, and attended Chopticon High School. He said he loved country music since he was a small boy and at age 16 he played country music in a local band. His first job was working for a local weekly newspaper in Maryland called The Enterprise . He attended St. Mary's College and graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1972. He had started there as a business major but changed to journalism. After college, he moved to Nashville with hopes of being a songwriter but became frustrated by his lack of success in the first couple of years. In a 1974 newspaper interview, Cusic recounted the difficulties was having at the time, saying \\"My plans haven't worked out like I thought they would, but at least I've got a foot in the industry and who knows what could happen\\". His \\"foot in the industry\\" was a reference to his landing a job in public relations in 1973 at the Country Music Association. Ironically, one of his duties there was returning tapes and lyrics of songs submitted by hopeful songwriters. Career As a staff writer at the Country Music Association in 1973, he became immersed in Nashville's music scene. He eventually became country and gospel editor for two trade magazines, Record World and later Cashbox. Cusic said, \\"The trade magazines were really important at that time as a connection to the gatekeepers...you come in off the street knowing nobody and, when you're with a trade magazine, you're talking to the heads of [record] labels the next day...that's how I learned the music industry, really\\". He became a book reviewer for MusicRow Magazine and a special correspondent for Billboard. In 1977 he became head of artist development and international liaison for Monument Records and partnered with Dan Beck as an artist manager for Riders In The Sky and Dickie Lee. By the early 1980s he felt himself drying up as a writer and enrolled in graduate courses at Middle Tennessee State University obtaining a Master's degree (1982) and a Doctor of Arts degree (1988).

He wrote biographical essays and edited books of the lyrics of Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. Cusic wrote The Beatles and Country Music, Baseball and Country Music, and Winston Churchill's Love of Music in addition to America and the American Recording Business, an overview of the recording industry. His book, Saved by Song: A History of Gospel and Christian Music (2012), was one of the first historical overviews of contemporary Christian music.

Traphagen House, also known as Redstone, is a historic residential building in Duluth, Minnesota, United States. Built in 1892 as a duplex, it was designed and inhabited by architect Oliver G. Traphagen (1854‚Äì1932). The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 for its local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for its association with Traphagen, recognized together with his business partner Francis W. Fitzpatrick as Duluth's leading architects of the late 19th century. In 2014 the house was heavily damaged by arson. Description Detail of the sandstone work beneath the turret The Traphagen House is a three-story Victorian mansion. The main fa√ßade is built of local red sandstone and features ornate carving and window dressing, along with towers and unusual dormers. The three other faces of the building are clad in red brick. The unornamented side elevations indicate that other buildings pressed close to the house when it was originally constructed. Built on a narrow city lot, the house is wide and long, with a minimal front yard and no side yards. A wraparound front porch spans the width of the ground floor, with stone balustrades marking the corners over the two entrances. The Traphagen House was originally designed as a duplex with two separate entrances and very similar floor plans on either side, with the exception of the front windows. The west side has curved windows while the east side has straight windows with wood wainscoting underneath. The interior totals more than . Both units contained a parlor, sitting room, library, dining room, and kitchen on the ground floor and bedrooms on the two upper floors. Every major room had its own fireplace. The house has 10 fireplaces total, all but one of which retain their original tile. The house also has antique light fixtures in most of the rooms. These fixtures operated on either gas or electricity, because at the time interior electric wiring was still new and not yet proven. History When he completed this house in 1892, Oliver G. Traphagen was already considered Duluth's preeminent architect. He'd moved to the city in the early 1880s with his brothers George and Walter, after a childhood in New York and a few years in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he'd worked as a carpenter. Duluth was booming and Traphagen rose swiftly from carpenter to contractor to architect. By 1890 his credits included Duluth City Hall, 20 commercial buildings, and 50 residences. Partnering with Francis W. Fitzpatrick brought additional renown, as their firm produced designs for several prominent buildings in Duluth. In the midst of his success, Traphagen designed this house for himself and his family. In 1896 he and Fitzpatrick dissolved their business partnership and Traphagen worked independently for almost a year. However one of his children fell ill and the Traphagens decided to move to the more healthful climate of Honolulu, Hawaii. Oliver Traphagen sold the house to mining magnate Chester Congdon, who lived there with his family from 1897 until their mansion Glensheen was completed in 1908. The Congdons, who still owned the house, subdivided it into nine small apartments in 1919. It continued to serve as an apartment building for the next 67 years, under a succession of owners and increasing decrepitude. In 1986 local businessman Howard Klatzky fell in love with the building and purchased it to be the headquarters for his advertising firm. \\"I bought it from a slumlord who'd owned it four different times,\\" Klatzky noted. He conducted extensive renovations and furnished the building with period antiques. With the building rezoned for commercial use, H.T. Klatzky and Associates had fully moved in by spring 1987. Klatzky retired in 2012 and sold the company to two longtime business partners, who renamed it HTK Marketing Communications. By then another firm, Ledingham Promotional Advertising, also had offices in the Traphagen House. Arson Shortly after midnight on August 18, 2014, a fire broke out on the first floor of the west unit and spread up a staircase into the second floor. Duluth firefighters extinguished the blaze, but what owner Howard Klatzky described as \\"the fanciest part of the whole building\\" was profoundly damaged, and the exterior was blackened on that side. In the morning the owner of a business across the street found a Molotov cocktail that had been thrown through his basement window but failed to ignite. Officials stated that the incidents were likely related, and opened an arson investigation. The fire in the Traphagen House struck just as the tenant businesses were about to relocate to more modern facilities in the DeWitt‚ÄìSeitz Building in Duluth's Canal Park. The planned move meant that Klatzky had retained ownership of the building, and earlier that summer had put it on the market for $750,000. He had also arranged to sell his antique furnishings at auction. About three-quarters of the antiques in the house were salvaged, though many of their values were reduced by soot and smoke damage. In November 2014 the vacant and fire-damaged house was burglarized, with thieves extracting piping, plumbing, and wiring for their metal. The Traphagen House remained structurally sound, and Klatzky aspired to save the building. In April 2015 he sold it to private developers for $1,000. A spokesman stated that the new ownership group \\"believes it is an intrinsically valuable property and they wanted it even not knowing what the restoration costs are going to be.\\" He cautioned however that demolition was a possibility if the building proved economically infeasible to restore.

Wallace's School House Door Speech. Accessed February 19, 2009. Background On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down its decision regarding the case called Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, in which the plaintiffs charged that the education of black children in separate public schools from their white counterparts was unconstitutional. Brown v. Board of Education meant that the University of Alabama had to be desegregated.

The University worked with police to find any disqualifying qualities, or when this failed, intimidated the applicants. But in 1963, three African-Americans ‚ÄîVivian Malone Jones, Dave McGlathery and James Hood‚Äîapplied. In early June a federal district judge ordered that they be admitted, and forbade Governor Wallace from interfering.Standing In the Schoolhouse Door (June). Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement. Accessed February 19, 2009 Incident Henry Graham salutes and then confronts George Wallace. Vivian Malone Jones arrives to register for classes at the University of Alabama's Foster Auditorium. On June 11, Malone and Hood pre- registered in the morning at the Birmingham courthouse. They selected their courses and filled out all their forms there. They arrived at Foster Auditorium to have their course loads reviewed by advisors and pay their fees. They remained in their vehicle as Wallace, attempting to uphold his promise as well as for political show, blocked the entrance to Foster Auditorium with the media watching. Then, flanked by federal marshals, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach told Wallace to step aside. However, Wallace interrupted Katzenbach and gave a speech on states' rights. Katzenbach called President John F. Kennedy, who had previously issued a presidential proclamation demanding that Wallace step aside, and told him of Wallace's actions in ignoring the proclamation as it had no legal force. In response, Kennedy issued Executive Order 11111, which had already been prepared, authorizing the federalization of the Alabama National Guard. Four hours later, Guard General Henry Graham commanded Wallace to step aside, saying, \\"Sir, it is my sad duty to ask you to step aside under the orders of the President of the United States.\\" Wallace then spoke further, but eventually moved, and Malone and Hood completed their registration. Aftermath In the days following the enactment, the National Guard were ordered to remain on the campus owing to a large Ku Klux Klan contingent in the surrounding area. Wallace and Kennedy exchanged volatile telegrams over it. Wallace objected to Kennedy ordering the Guard to remain on the campus and said that Kennedy bore responsibility if something happened. Kennedy responded stating that Executive Order 11111 made it clear that responsibility for keeping the peace remained with the State Troopers under Wallace's control and said he would revoke the order if assurances were made. Wallace refused, stating he would not be intimidated and cited that Executive Order 11111 was passed without his knowledge. Executive Order 11111 was also used to ensure that the Alabama National Guard made sure that black students across the state were able to enroll at previously all- white schools. It was complemented by Executive Order 11118, which provided \\"assistance for removal of unlawful obstructions of justice in the State of Alabama.\\" As of June 2020, Executive Order 11111 has not been revoked. Cultural references The incident was detailed in Robert Drew's 1963 documentary film Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment. The event was depicted in the 1994 film Forrest Gump, in which the title character appeared at the event, and in the 1997 television movie George Wallace. In June 2012, George Wallace Jr. commented on his father's legacy, and mentioned the reference to the event in Bob Dylan's 1964 song \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\": \\"Come Senators, Congressmen, please heed the call. Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.\\" The younger Wallace said that when he was 14, he sang the song for his father and thought he saw the look of regret in his father's eyes.

In this capacity, BCG will, in coordination with AGC, act as the Project Management Office (PMO) working with contractors and construction software developers to accomplish easy data exchange and integrated systems using agcXML schema. In this role, BCG is responsible for driving this initiative forward in a timely manner. They will be involved in all aspects of this project and will specifically provide guidance to both the agcXML Advisory Board and Application Workgroups, establish and clarify responsibilities for each group, track the project's progress to ensure its success, facilitate open and clear communications between all parties both internally and externally and ensure the project stays within budget. Since 1994, BCG has been the premier provider of information technology and information systems management consulting to construction companies. Deeply experienced in the construction industry and familiar with the range of software applications in this sector, BCG remains completely vendor- independent making them an excellent choice as agcXML Industry Steward.  History  The agcXML Project was an industry-wide initiative funded and led by the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) and managed, under a contract with AGC, by the National Institute of Building Sciences. The goal of the project was to enable the efficient and reliable exchange of electronic construction project information among all building design and construction professionals. While building information modeling (BIM) is designed to facilitate the electronic exchange and the effective use of information about a building facility throughout the life cycle of a building facility, the agcXML Project focuses on transactional data ‚Äî which may or may not be \\"building information\\" ‚Äî that architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and building owners typically exchange during the building design and construction process. Most of this information is still commonly exchanged in paper documents (or electronic equivalents of paper documents) such as owner/contractor agreements, schedules of values, requests for information (RFIs), requests for proposals (RFPs), architect/engineer supplemental instructions, change orders, change directives, submittals, applications for payment, and addenda, to name a few. The project resulted in a set of extensible markup language (XML) schemas that will enable design and construction professionals to reliably exchange project information among dissimilar and proprietary software applications, without requiring the reengineering or redesign of those applications. The agcXML schemas established a common, non-proprietary data format and classification system. Software developers will be able to modify their applications with minimal effort to import and export data in agcXML format, without having to change or even share their proprietary software code and data formats. The schemas will remain the property of AGC, will be made publicly available and will be licensed at no cost and in perpetuity to any party for any legitimate purpose in support of the exchange of agcXML data. The project is coordinated with other data format standards development efforts worldwide to ensure the compatibility of agcXML data with those efforts.

He previously played for the Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, and Chicago Cubs. He is nicknamed \\"Dutch Oven\\". Professional career Texas Rangers The Texas Rangers selected Holland in the 25th round of the 2006 MLB draft out of Wallace State Community College in Hanceville, Alabama, a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association. He was the number two rated prospect in the Rangers organization according to Baseball America, behind Neftal√≠ Feliz, for 2009. On April 22, 2009, Holland made his MLB debut; pitching innings, allowing three hits, no runs, no walks, and striking out two. On August 9, he pitched his first complete game, a 7‚Äì0 shutout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in Anaheim. For the 2009 season, Holland finished the season 8‚Äì13 with a 6.12 ERA in 33 games (21 starts). Holland spent the majority of 2010 in Triple-A Oklahoma City, and was called up only due to injuries to other starters. After winning his first two decisions, he lost his next three. He ended the regular season with a 3‚Äì4 record, and 4.08 ERA. Holland allowed three runs in innings in the 2010 ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays. He pitched 5.2 innings in the 2010 ALCS with no earned runs. In Game 4, he earned the victory against the defending champion New York Yankees. He entered the game in the fourth inning with one out and the bases loaded, and got his team out of a serious jam while also eating away innings to protect his bullpen. In game 2 of the 2010 World Series, Holland entered with one on and two outs in the bottom of the 8th inning, with the Rangers trailing 2‚Äì0. Holland walked all three batters he faced without recording an out, and he forced in the runner he inherited via his final walk. Holland's wildness opened the door for what turned into a huge inning for the eventual champion Giants, as all three of the batters he walked came around to score. The Rangers lost the game 9‚Äì0. Holland pitched a scoreless relief inning in a game four 4‚Äì0 loss, but the Rangers lost the series 4‚Äì1. Holland started the 2011 season as a starter for the Rangers, and despite a 4.96 ERA, won four of his five starts in April and May. He lowered his ERA to 4.14 in June, mainly by virtue of his first shutout of the season. He started off July with inconsistency, failing to make it out of the first inning against the Marlins. Over the next five starts, he responded by throwing three more shutouts. In 2011, he was 16‚Äì5 with a 3.95 ERA. He led the AL in shutouts (4; tied for fifth-most in Rangers history), was 3rd in win- loss percentage (.762; the fifth-best in Rangers history), and was 4th in wins. On October 23, Holland was the winning pitcher in Game 4 of the 2011 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, giving up no runs on two hits, two walks and striking out seven. He was pulled from the game after pitching innings. The Rangers lost the World Series in seven games. Holland in 2014 Holland signed a contract extension on March 20, 2012, that was worth $28.5 million over five years with a two-year club option. Holland finished the regular season with a win-loss record of 12‚Äì7 with an ERA of 4.67 as he gave up 32 home runs, fifth highest in Major League Baseball. In 2013, Holland went 10‚Äì9 with a 3.42 ERA in 33 starts. On January 7, 2014, Holland suffered a knee injury after a fall while playing with his dog at home. Holland underwent arthroscopic microfracture surgery to repair torn cartilage in his left knee on January 10, 2014. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list and sidelined until the All-Star break. Holland strained his subscapularis muscle during the Rangers' first home game of the 2015 season, and was placed on the 60-day disabled list on April 10. Holland returned on August 19, 2015 to start against the Seattle Mariners. He went innings pitched with six strikeouts and 2 earned runs as he earned his first win of the season in a 7‚Äì2 Rangers' win. On August 30, Holland threw a complete game against the Baltimore Orioles at Globe Life Park. His last complete game was on September 23, 2013. It was his eighth career shutout. He went nine innings, no walks, no runs, 11 strikeouts, and allowed only three hits, in a 6‚Äì0 win. On November 8, 2016, the Rangers announced they would decline a 2017 club option on Holland, making him a free agent. Holland was due to receive $11 million in pay in 2017, and received a $1.5 million buyout. Chicago White Sox On December 14, 2016, Holland signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Chicago White Sox. Holland began the season with a 2.37 ERA in 10 starts, but afterwards, his performance regressed immensely. He was granted an unconditional release on September 5, 2017, after a 7‚Äì14 record, 6.20 ERA and a 1.71 WHIP through 26 starts and 3 relief appearances with the White Sox. San Francisco Giants On February 9, 2018, Holland signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. With injuries to Madison Bumgarner and Jeff Samardzija, Holland was added to the rotation at the beginning of the season. Throughout the season, he would make starts and also provide relief appearances from the bullpen. He finished the 2018 season with a 7‚Äì9 record and a 3.57 ERA. On January 14, 2019, the Giants re-signed Holland to a one-year deal with a club option for 2020, earning a base salary of $6.5 million and a $500,000 buyout for 2020. Holland earned his first win of the season on April 9 against the Padres. On April 29, Holland was placed on the 10-day injured list with a bone bruise in his left index finger. Upon returning from the IL, he started against Colorado, giving up seven earned runs over innings. In a post-game interview on May 11, Holland told the media that he \\"faked an injury\\" and questioned the Front Office's operations. Bruce Bochy and Farhan Zaidi both responded to his statement, chastising him for not approaching them first before speaking to the media and ensuring they had an open door policy when it comes to player concerns. Since his start in Colorado, Holland has been relegated to long-relief appearances out of the bullpen. On July 21, 2019, Holland was designated for assignment. Chicago Cubs On July 26, 2019, the Giants traded Holland to the Chicago Cubs for cash considerations. On August 25, 2019, he was placed on the 10 day IL and sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs and was replaced with David Bote. Holland became a free agent following the 2019 season. Pittsburgh Pirates On January 31, 2020, Holland signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates that included an invitation to Spring Training. On August 8, 2020, against the Detroit Tigers, Holland allowed 5 runs on 4 home runs on his first 11 pitches in the first inning. He allowed 9 runs on 5 home runs altogether in 5 innings as the Pirates lost 5-11. Controversies During a game in the 2012 season, Holland's Twitter account was used to attack another Twitter user with a slur. Holland responded to the ensuing controversy by claiming his Twitter account was hacked. In 2018, Holland appeared in a skit on MLB Network's Intentional Talk in which he mocked Asian people by feigning a racially insensitive accent. Holland didn't agree with assertions that his actions were racist, but said he understood why people were upset. The San Francisco Giants and Holland later apologized for his actions. In 2019, Holland verbally attacked the Giants and claimed they made him fake an injury so as to be placed on the injured list. The Giants denied the allegation.  60 feet 6 Foundation  In 2014, Holland launched the 60 Feet 6 Foundation to help raise awareness of and fund research for leukemia, particularly its pediatric forms.

In 2001, the parks department finalized plans for the park, which included parking, basketball courts, sports fields, tennis courts, play equipment, and the skatepark. In March of the following year the city solicited input from residents on the design of what was then planned to be a skatepark.‚ÄúCommunity Snapshot: Hillsboro News‚Äù, The Oregonian, March 20, 2002, p.

B2. Early plans estimated the cost of the structure to total approximately $100,000 for the outdoor skatepark that was to be designed to accommodate beginner and intermediate levels of ability. During the skatepark design process, the city received over 100 suggestions from residents, primarily from teenagers.Anderson, David R. ‚ÄúKids help design place to grind‚Äù, The Oregonian, May 9, 2002, West Zoner, p. 1. The process resulted in plans for a skatepark that featured primarily street elements such as steps and rails that skateboarders would normally find in urban settings. Mike McIntyre and his SITE Design Group were hired by the city to design the skatepark, which had then grown to a plan and a cost of $200,000 to $300,000. The city put the construction out for bid on the entire park in May 2002, with estimates for the total cost of the park reaching as high as $1.5 million.‚ÄúCommunity Snapshot: Hillsboro News‚Äù, The Oregonian, June 6, 2002, p.

The pupils of Aristotle were the first to comment on his writings, a tradition which was continued by the Peripatetic school throughout the Hellenistic period and the Roman era. The Neoplatonists of the late Roman empire wrote many commentaries on Aristotle, attempting to incorporate him into their philosophy. Although Ancient Greek commentaries are considered the most useful, commentaries continued to be written by the Christian scholars of the Byzantine Empire and by the many Islamic philosophers and Western scholastics who had inherited his texts. Greek commentators The first pupils of Aristotle commentated on his writings, but often with a view to expand his work. Thus Theophrastus invented five moods of syllogism in the first figure, in addition to the four invented by Aristotle, and stated with additional accuracy the rules of hypothetical syllogisms. He also often differed with his master,Brucker 1837, pages 349-53 including in collecting much information concerning animals and natural events, which Aristotle had omitted. During the early Roman empire we find few celebrated names among the Peripatetic philosophers. Nicolaus of Damascus wrote several treatises on the philosophy of Aristotle; and Alexander of Aegae also wrote commentaries on Aristotle.Whewell 1837, pages 271-5 The earliest commentaries which survive, are those written in the 2nd century by Adrastus and Aspasius.Sorabji 1998, pages 435-7 Alexander of Aphrodisias (c. 200) was regarded by subsequent Aristotelians among the Greeks, Latins, and Muslims, as the best interpreter of Aristotle. On account of the number and value of his commentaries, he was called, by way of distinction, \\"The Commentator\\". Several of his works are still extant, among which is a treatise On Fate, wherein he supports the doctrine of divine providence. Many of the Neoplatonists undertook to explain and illustrate the writings of Aristotle, particularly on the subject of dialectics, which Plato had left imperfect. Porphyry (3rd century) wrote a book on the Categories, which was found to be so suitable a complement to the Categories of Aristotle, that it was usually prefixed to that treatise. Porphyry sought to show that Plato and Aristotle were in harmony with each other, especially in regards to the compatibility of Aristotle's Categories with Plato's Theory of Forms. Porphyry's pupil Iamblichus continued this process of harmonising Plato and Aristotle, and Dexippus, a disciple of Iamblichus, wrote a Reply to the Objections of Plotinus against Aristotle's Categories, which is still extant. Themistius (4th century), who taught at Constantinople with great success, paraphrased several of the works of Aristotle, particularly the Posterior Analytics, the Physics, and the book On the Soul. In the 5th century, Ammonius Hermiae represented Plato and Aristotle in agreeing that god was the artificier of a beginningless universe. Olympiodorus, an Alexandrian philosopher, wrote commentaries upon Aristotle's Meteorology and Categories. Simplicius of Cilicia (6th century) wrote extensive commentaries upon Aristotle, and, like many of the other Neoplatonists, attempted to reconcile the doctrines of the Pythagoreans, of the Eleatics, of Plato, and of the Stoics, with those of Aristotle. He also strenuously defended Aristotle's doctrine concerning the eternity of the world. In the 6th century, Boethius, whose commentaries on the logical works of Aristotle became the only commentaries in Latin available to the West, entertained the design of translating into Latin the whole of Aristotle's and Plato's works, and of showing their agreement; a gigantic plan, which he never executed. Others employed themselves in disentangling the confusion which such attempts produced, as John Philoponus, who, in the sixth century, maintained that Aristotle was entirely misunderstood by Porphyry and Proclus in incorporating his doctrines into those of the Neoplatonists, or even in reconciling him with Plato himself on the subject of ideas, offering instead a Christian interpretation of the Aristotelian corpus. Others, again, wrote epitomes, compounds, abstracts; and tried to throw the works of Aristotle into some simpler and more obviously regular form, as John of Damascus, in the middle of the 8th century, who made abstracts of some of Aristotle's works, and introduced the study of the author into theological education. John of Damascus lived under the patronage of the Arabs, and was at first secretary to the Caliph, but afterwards withdrew to a monastery. Islamic commentators In the 9th century, the Platonising school of ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra in Baghdad translated Aristotle and his commentators into Arabic. Islamic scholars made a point of studying the writings of Aristotle, especially his metaphysical and logical writings, and also of his Physics. They wrote commentaries on Aristotle, and developed still further the abstract logical element. Many of these commentaries are still extant.Hegel 1896, pages 34-5 Al-Kindi, who wrote a commentary on Aristotelian logic, lived in the 9th century, under Al-Ma'mun. Al-Farabi (10th century) wrote commentaries on Aristotle's Organon, which were made diligent use of by the Scholastics. It is related of him that he read through Aristotle's treatise On Hearing forty times, and his Rhetoric two hundred times, without getting at all tired of them. The physicians made a study of philosophy, and formulated theories; among them was Avicenna (c. 980-1037), who came from Bukhara, to the east of the Caspian Sea; he wrote a commentary on Aristotle. Al-Ghazali (1058‚Äì1111) wrote compendiums of logic and metaphysics. Averroes (1126‚Äì1198) was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified.Grant 1996, page 30 Although his writings had only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works had a huge impact in the Latin West following the Latin translations of the 12th and 13th centuries. Byzantine commentators The line of the Aristotelian commentators was continued to the later ages of the Byzantine Empire. In the 12th century Anna Comnena organised a group of scholars which included the commentators Michael of Ephesus, and Eustratius of Nicaea who employed himself upon the dialectic and moral treatises, and whom she does not hesitate to elevate above the Stoics and Platonists for his talent in philosophical discussions. Nicephorus Blemmydes wrote logical and physical epitomes for the use of John III Doukas Vatatzes; George Pachymeres composed an epitome of the philosophy of Aristotle, and a compendium of his logic: Theodore Metochites, who was famous in his time for his eloquence and his learning, has left a paraphrase of the books of Aristotle on Physics, On the Soul, On the Heavens, etc. The same period saw the commentaries and paraphrases of Sophonias. In the post- Byzantine period, one of the most important Aristotelian commentators is Theophilos Corydalleus. Commentators in the Latin West Scholastic philosophy in the Latin West was decisively shaped when the works of Aristotle became widely available, at first through translations of commentators and their basis texts from Arabic, and later through translations from Greek of Aristotle's original text (notably by William of Moerbeke) and of the Greek commentators. Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham, among many others, wrote important philosophical works in the form of Aristotelian commentaries. On this basis, 14th -century scholar Nicole Oresme translated Aristotle's moral works into French and wrote extensive comments on them.

Having first made cameos in Kingdom Hearts II and other related titles, Ventus was introduced in the 2010 prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep as one of the game's three playable protagonists. In its story, Ventus is introduced as the youngest apprentice of Master Eraqus who trains him alongside his best friends, Terra and Aqua, to become experienced warriors with the Keyblade. When Terra goes on a mission to find Master Xehanort, Ventus follows him, having also become concerned about his fate. As Ventus journeys through various worlds and battles dark creatures called the Unversed, he learns about his own origins as well as his relation to Xehanort's apprentice, Vanitas. Ventus was designed by director Tetsuya Nomura who wanted to create a character with an important connection with the series' main character Sora. Ventus bears a strong resemblance to the character of Roxas, both of whom are voiced by K≈çki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English. After Ventus's first cameo, Nomura had to clarify that both of them are different characters, and that the reason for such connection would be revealed in Birth by Sleep. Video game websites also commented on Ventus's first appearance, initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of Birth by Sleep, but has since been well received. Appearances Before being introduced in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Ventus made cameos in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and its re- release, Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, which depict him and his friends Terra and Aqua battling Master Xehanort and Vanitas. Ventus is also shown in a cameo in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days when Xion, a replica of Roxas, appears as Ventus while fighting Xigbar from Organization XIII. Ventus is also constantly referenced by Xigbar in Kingdom Hearts II and 358/2 Days while Xemnas, the Nobody of Xehanort, searches for him in Castle Oblivion. Birth by Sleep introduces Ventus as an apprentice of Master Xehanort, who tries conditioning him into a dark component of the œá-blade. Due to Ventus's reluctance to use darkness, Xehanort extracts it from his heart and creates Vanitas, damaging his heart in the process. Xehanort brings Ventus to the Destiny Islands, where his heart connects with that of a newborn Sora to keep it from collapsing. An amnesiac Ventus is placed under Master Eraqus's care alongside Terra and Aqua, whom he forms a sibling-like bond with. At the game's beginning, Vanitas provokes Ventus into pursuing Terra during the latter's search for Xehanort, pitting him against dark creatures called the Unversed to strengthen him. Upon meeting Xehanort, Ventus rediscovers his purpose in the œá-blade's creation. Ventus refuses to battle Vanitas and create the weapon, but is forced to do so after Vanitas threatens his friends. They battle within the Keyblade Graveyard, where Vanitas merges with Ventus and obtains the œá-blade. However, the fusion is incomplete, which allows Ventus to destroy both Vanitas and the œá-blade within his heart, losing his own heart as a result. Aqua reconfigures the Land of Departure into Castle Oblivion to keep Ventus's catatonic body safe, while his wandering heart is able to find its way back to Sora, who accepts Ventus's heart into his body. Ventus makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts Coded, where Mickey Mouse‚Äîwhom Ventus befriends in the previous game‚Äîdiscovers his heart is connected with Sora's. In Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, Sora briefly takes Ventus's form during a dream, and when his heart is wounded, Ventus's armor appears to protect his body. In the game's ending, Ventus is seen smiling in Castle Oblivion, still asleep. An apparition of Ventus appears in the realm of darkness in Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep ‚Äì A Fragmentary Passage, a playable episode included in Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. Kingdom Hearts Union œá, set many years before Birth by Sleep, reveals Ventus to have been a member of the Dandelions and one of the five Union leaders chosen after the end of the Keyblade War. Together with the other leaders, he forms Union Cross to prevent history from repeating itself. Ventus returns in Kingdom Hearts III after being restored and reunited with Terra, Aqua, and his Dream Eater partner Chirithy. Creation and development When first designing Ventus, Tetsuya Nomura already decided the character should look like Sora or Roxas, and decided to choose the latter when thinking that Vanitas being revealed to have Sora's appearance would give a big impact to the gamers. Nomura wanted Ventus's personality to more closely resemble Sora's, which led to his outgoing personality, yet at the same time he wanted him to become more serious as the game progressed to make them distinct. Ventus was first shown in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and its rerelease Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix. Ventus's name first appeared as a code in a 2006 Tokyo Game Show promotional video of the games. While making Final Mixs ending, Nomura had only developed the backstory for Terra, Aqua and Ventus and not their appearances, but had to finish their design for the end of game cameo. Nomura did not reveal their identities, and only stated that the three character were from the chronological past of the Kingdom Hearts series. Following their release, Nomura stated that his nickname was Ven. Ventus was first mentioned by the character Lingering Sentiment in Final Mix as Ven, while his full name was still unrevealed. He also mentioned a connection between him and Xemnas but wanted to leave it up to people's imaginations as he still could not reveal his identity. Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus are not the same character. Additionally, he stated that by playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true personality. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection. The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus's heart entered Sora's body, and that Ventus's presence influenced Roxas's appearance when he was created. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus's broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers, it was abandoned. Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced K≈çki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English. Ventus's name means \\"wind\\" in Latin; both it and his Keyblade's default form, , have a \\"sky\\" theme similar to that of Sora's. During the development of Birth by Sleep, the Osaka team in charge of developing the game suggested that Ventus should be related with Vanitas, something which Nomura liked as he wanted to add more connections within the story; Vanitas's name was chosen to sound similar to Ventus's name. Nomura had trouble designing the armor for Ventus, Terra, and Aqua, since the gameplay mechanism for activating their armor had not been fleshed out. Therefore, an \\"X\\" was added to their clothes as a way to activate the armor, as well as due to the fact it was one of the game's keywords. Ever since development of Birth by Sleep started, the staff already decided that Ventus, Aqua, and Terra's stories would be told in separate scenarios, with Ventus's story being the second one written. They also wanted emphasize the lack of coincidences in the series, leading to the interaction between the three scenarios. In the perspective of gameplay, Ventus was designed to be the easiest character to play with in Birth by Sleep, although Nomura recommended to players that Ventus should be the second character to play with in order to better understand the story. Additionally, the way Ventus handles his Keyblade backwards is meant to show the gameplay differences between his and Terra's and Aqua's scenarios. Nomura also remarked that Ventus's encounter with the characters Lea and Isa as an important event from the game, hoping both newcomers and older gamers will also find it important from Ventus's perspective. Reception Due to his resemblance with Roxas, video game publications initially thought that Roxas would be one of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep upon seeing one of Ventus's images. However, when it was revealed that the two were separate characters, publications continued to discuss how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. GamesRadar particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the two of them and Sora. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central also commented on speculations regarding the similarities between both of them, but mentioned that due to the existence of Nobodies in series, it is hard to find them as coincidences. When Jesse McCartney confirmed he was working on the English localization of Birth by Sleep, sites thought that he would voice Ventus, as he also voiced Roxas in previous titles. The character's story and actions shown in the demonstrations were praised for being the \\"most original take on Kingdom Hearts\\" and yet \\"frustratingly traditional\\". Upon Ventus's introduction in Birth by Sleep, X-Play found the character to be very similar to Sora's due to his friendly attitude. Kevin VanOrd from the same site gave praise to Ventus's character for his \\"well-meaning\\" and yet not \\"annoying\\" personality. The site also said that the time players spend playing with Ventus would be \\"rewarding\\" and commented on the English voice acting. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio of Ventus, Terra and Aqua as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. On the other hand, PALGN found the three characters unappealing, labelling Ventus as \\"just a Roxas clone, but without his personality.\\" In contrast to 1UP's comments towards Ventus's actions in Cinderella's world, VanOrd commented on such interactions to be \\"more bothersome than boisterous.\\" Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antistaer called Ventus a \\"Roxas-clone\\", and did not understand why he was briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that fans considered Ventus to be the most important character in Birth by Sleep due to his similarities to Roxas. Additionally, Miur praised Jesse McCartney's work as Ventus's English voice actor for making his story mode more engaging to players.

It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California to Colorado, where it grows in several habitat types including coniferous forest, chaparral, and various types of woodland. Description The oval leaves have tiny teeth with glands along the edges. Ceanothus velutinus grows up to 4 meters tall but generally remains under three, and forms colonies of individuals which tangle together to form nearly impenetrable thickets.Forest Service Fire Ecology The aromatic evergreen leaves are alternately arranged, each up to 8 centimeters long. The leaves are oval in shape with minute glandular teeth along the edges, and shiny green and hairless on the top surface. The plentiful inflorescences are long clusters of white flowers. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule a few millimeters long which snaps open explosively to expel the three seeds onto the soil, where they may remain in a buried seed bank for well over 200 years before sprouting. The seed is coated in a very hard outer layer that must be scarified, generally by wildfire, before it can germinate. Like most other ceanothus, this species fixes nitrogen via actinomycetes on its roots. Uses Some Plateau Indian tribes drank a boil of this plant to induce sweating as a treatment for colds, fevers, and influenza. Leaves were also used when rinsing to help prevent dandruff. Ceanothus velutinus was known as \\"red root\\" by many Native American tribes due to the color of the inner root bark, and was used as a medicine for treating lymphatic disorders, ovarian cysts, fibroid tumors, and tonsillitis. Clinical studies of the alkaloid compounds in C. velutinus has verified its effectiveness in treating high blood pressure and lymphatic blockages.Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L.

Six of the eight people on board the Ambassador were killed, along with the eight racehorses being transported on it. citing Aircraft Illustrated Vol.1, nr. 4 (Oct. 1968), p.127 The crash was blamed on the failure of a flap-operating rod due to metal fatigue, resulting in asymmetrical lift. Accident The Ambassador, construction number 5211, had previously been British European Airways' Sir Francis Drake. It had recently been converted to a \\"horsebox\\" transport and was on a flight from Deauville, France, to Heathrow Airport. It was transporting eight racehorses belonging to businessman William Hill together with five grooms. As the aircraft was landing on Heathrow's runway 28R the left wing dropped, and the wing tip and left landing gear touched the grass adjacent to the runway. The crew tried to increase power to go-around and climb away, but the bank angle increased. The aircraft hit two parked empty British European Airways Hawker Siddeley Tridents, knocking the tail fin off one (G-ARPI) and slicing off the entire tail section of the other (G-ARPT). The Ambassador cartwheeled following the impact and slid upside down coming up against the ground floor of the terminal building where there was an explosion. Six people on board the Ambassador died, including the flight crew and three of five grooms, along with all eight horses. The other two grooms were seriously injured as were two people on the ground. A further 29 people on the ground received slight injuries. Of the two Trident aircraft, G-ARPT was damaged beyond economic repair and G-ARPI was subsequently repaired; it was later destroyed when it crashed on 18 June 1972 in what became known as the Staines Air Disaster. A Viscount (G-APKF) received slight damage.ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS: JUNE/JULY Flight International The Viscount was also repaired but was also later destroyed when it crashed at Phnom Penh Airport, Cambodia in March 1975 after being sold to Royal Air Lao as XW-TDN All other Ambassadors were grounded pending the result of an inquiry. The starboard rod from the aircraft was tested and found satisfactory but rods from some other Ambassadors showed signs of cracking and when tested failed in a similar manner to G-AMAD's port rod. The rods on aircraft were strengthened and shown to be capable of 37,000 hours flight time. Probable cause The port (left) flap operating rod had failed due to metal fatigue. While the mechanism had failed, the compensating mechanism between the two sets of flaps remained intact. The port flaps had retracted but the compensator caused the starboard ones to extend further. The resulting asymmetry of lift resulted in the roll to port. The pilot probably tried to overshoot and set the flaps to the correct 10 degrees, but due to the mechanism design this was not sufficient to cause the starboard flaps to retract (which would have taken 25 seconds in any event). The Department of Transport report concluded that whatever the pilot's actions, it was \\"doubtful\\" whether an accident could have been avoided. After the accident all Ambassadors were fitted with steel reinforcements to the flap operating rods.

Description A. dentiger is a small woodlouse, at only 6 mm (¬º in) long, and is characteristically pink or orange in colour, with a yellow stripe along the midline of the dorsal surface, which divides in two towards the animal's tail. It has large eyes for its size and a granular exoskeleton. Ecology In the British Isles, A. dentiger is found in a wide variety of habitats, including coastal areas, gardens, old quarries and caves. It lives where there is a significant amount of lime available, and is reported to show a preference for Anglican churchyards over Catholic ones because the older, Protestant churches used ox-blood mortar. In the south of its range, A. dentiger is primarily troglobitic, with populations in different cave systems being genetically isolated by the lack of migration between caves. Animals like A. dentiger which prefer to live in caves, but are not restricted to the cave environment may be termed troglophilic. In North America, A. dentiger is only known to occur in greenhouses. Subspecies According to some authors, A. dentiger may be considered a complex of sibling species or cryptic species . Six subspecies are recognised: *Androniscus dentiger africanus Arcangeli, 1939 *Androniscus dentiger caecus Brian, 1938 *Androniscus dentiger calcivagus Verhoeff, 1908 *Androniscus dentiger croaticus Strouhal, 1939 *Androniscus dentiger dentiger Verhoeff, 1908 *Androniscus dentiger ligulifer Verhoeff, 1908 See also *List of woodlice of the British Isles References Category:Woodlice Category:Crustaceans described in 1908 Category:Arthropods of Africa Category:Woodlice of Europe Category:Taxa named by Karl Wilhelm Verhoeff ","title":"Androniscus dentiger"},{"id":"21612952","text":"Mofeed or Mufid Fawzy () is an Egyptian television presenter, interviewer and journalist.

Formed in July 1862, the regiment served in both the eastern and western theaters until it was disbanded after the war ended.  History  Raised in July 1862, upon formation the 20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment was placed under the command of Colonel Samuel Ross, a former Regular Army officer. With him becoming brigade commander soon afterwards; for most of the war the regiment was commanded by its Lieutenant Colonel, William Wooster. Wooster was a businessman in civilian life and more popular than the stern disciplinarian Ross. The regiment became part of the 1st Division XII Corps and had its baptism of fire at the Battle of Chancellorsville. On May 2, 1863, at Chancellorsville, the unit suffered heavy casualties as they and other units of the XII Corps bore the brunt of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson's surprise assault. On July 2, 1863, on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, several units were moved from the Union right flank on Culp's Hill to the south to reinforce the left flank which was being attacked. Seeing an opportunity, Confederate General Richard S. Ewell launched an attack on Culp's Hill and his men occupied the earthworks deserted by the withdrawn units. Attempts were made to retake the fortifications, but due to miscommunications, such attempts were unsuccessful and resulted in heavy Union casualties. At dawn on July 3, 1863, the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, devised a plan to launch a massive assault on the center of the Union line (the attack now infamously known as Pickett's Charge). This plan also called for Ewell's troops to renew their assault on Culp's Hill to keep any Union regiments from leaving that area to reinforce the assault's target area. Long before Pickett's men were ready to make the charge, Ewell's men, still occupying the earthworks, awoke to a ferocious artillery barrage from Union batteries nearby. Forced into action by the bombardment, Ewell sent a message back to Lee saying that he could not wait for the main assault to begin to attack, and was sending his troops into battle. The 20th Connecticut was tasked with scouting the movements of the enemy and relaying that information to nearby batteries and did so while stayed in the woods overlooking the Confederate position. It was a dangerous task as they had to be close to the target in order to give accurate reports and several men of the 20th were killed or wounded due to misfires or faulty ammunition. The last one to be wounded was Private George W. Warner, who lost both of his arms when a misfired shell detonated above him. The infuriated Wooster sent back a report to the batteries which allegedly said that if one more of his men were injured from a misfire, he would pull the 20th out of position, turn them around, and charge the batteries himself. The courier who carried the message added the comment, \\"...he'd do it, too, so be careful.\\" The Union artillery fire proved to be devastating. A following infantry assault drove Ewell's men from the hill. Confederate counterattacks, while outnumbering the, now entrenched, defenders, were repulsed and suffered heavy losses. This was one of the first times that an infantry unit was used as spotting force for artillery. Citing the effectiveness, the tactic was used by several other Union generals throughout the rest of the war, including Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman. It later became a common practice in the army and is still being employed today. After Gettysburg, the XII Corps was transferred to the western theater. In April 1864, the XI and the XII Corps were reformed into the XX Corps. With it the 20th Connecticut took part in a number of campaigns and battles including the Atlanta Campaign, Sherman's March to the Sea and the Battle of Bentonville. The regiment marched as part of the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington D.C. and was mustered out on June 13, 1865.

She was long owned by Eestaas and operated by Uusi Tuuli. Now she belongs to a \\"Ship to Gaza\\" company Northern Breeze AB, registered in Turku, Finland. Estelle was previously maintained by volunteers who had the desire to sail to Africa to export assistance supplies and bring back fair trade goods and operate according to the ideals of Fair Trade. She made her first trip to Africa in 2002, before which she also visited the Mediterranean Sea, Ireland and some harbors of Northern Europe. In addition, many of the ship's crew have been trained while sailing in the Baltic Sea. After her trip to Angola, Estelle has mainly sailed in the Baltic Sea, participated in the Tall Ships Race of 2003, and collaborated with Greenpeace on research and campaign work. Estelle is also constantly training new crew members since it is open to practically any one. Estelles operations are primarily based on volunteers. Operations strive for environmental sustainability, solidarity and global equality. Since 2003, Prometheus camps have been organized on Estelle every summer as a non-religious alternative to confirmation camp. During the camp the boat tours around the archipelago near Turku.

On October 20, 2012 the Israeli military seized the vessel without incident and took it to the port of Ashdod. In August 2013 the state of Israel filed a petition to confiscate the vessel. In August 2016, the Israeli supreme court ruled that the state cannot confiscate the Estelle, and ordered to state to pay NIS 40,000 to the ship's owner to cover court costs. Estelle is the latest in a series of vessels manned by activists who have tried to challenge Israel's blockade on Gaza, imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007.

Thoramanian, Niouter haykakam djhartarapetouthian matmoutian (Tools for the study of Armenian architecture history), Erevan, 1942 Etymology and history Yererouk means quivering in the Armenian language. According to popular tradition, the name of the temple was derived from its unique architectural solution of the structure which seems quivering on its 6 columns for viewers from a distance. Yererouk is one of the earliest examples of the Armenian church architecture and one of the greatest structures of the early medieval ages that partly survived. According to Toros Toramanian, Yererouk is a clear and perhaps the earliest example of the basilica style of the Armenian church buildings that are constructed on pillars. The church was surrounded with thick walls. From the surrounding buildings, underground rooms and the water reservoir, it becomes clear that the church was the centre of a developed residential community. Yererouk dates back to the 4th and 5th centuries. It is located in the Shirak canton of the Ayrarat province of Ancient Armenia. Not much is known about the founders of the basilica. However, the church was renovated during the 11th century by the efforts of King Hovhannes-Smbat's wife. The Basilica The building, with three aisles, structured with thick lateral walls, is one of the biggest Armenian churches of the period. With arcades on the north, west and south sides, two little chapels near the apse and two absidal niches at the end of the lateral arcades, the basilica in origin could be covered wooden trusses. The north-east chapel keeps the most part of two superimposed vaults which the superior is inclined (taller near the nave).A.

The archeological excavations revealed the lack of a continuous platform under the building which foundations are directly on rock. The Basilica was a martyrial sanctuary: an inscription on the pilaster at the north-east corner of the apse says: \\"martyrion [...] of the Precursor and the Protomartyr\\", that are Saint John Baptist and Saint Stephen.D.

The sculptural decorations, realized with the technique of bass-relief on the architrave and capitals in the apse and on the head of the arcades, give importance to the emblematic and apotropaic motive of the Maltese cross (with four identical limbs) inscribed in a medallion, sometimes decorated with animals and/or trees. The central crossed medallion is often completed by two lateral medallions made like rose- windows or daisies.

A twin-engined triplane, the London was dogged by the unavailability and unreliability of its engines, and did not fly until 1920. Only two were built. Development and design In 1918, Henry Folland, chief designer of the Nieuport (England) Ltd (later to become the Nieuport & General Aircraft Co Ltd.), formerly of the Royal Aircraft Factory and designer of the S.E.5, designed the Nieuport London to meet the RAF Type VII specification for a night bomber, an order for six Londons was placed in July 1918.Mason 1994, p.124. The London was a twin-engined triplane with equal span, two-bay wings, powered by the new ABC Dragonfly radial engine. It was designed for ease of production, and was built of wood with use of metal fittings minimised. The angular fuselage was covered by ¬º inch (6 mm) thick wooden boarding joined by Tongue and groove joints, techniques more usually found in furniture manufacture. The fabric covered wings were unstaggered and had ailerons fitted to each wing, while the tail unit had a prominent ventral fin similar to that fitted to Folland's S.E.5 and Nighthawk fighters. Bombload was 2,250 lb (1,023 kg), while as the London was solely intended to operate by night, defensive armament was limited to a pair of Lewis guns in the nose.Bruce 1957, p.321.Lewis 1974, pp.109-110. The end of the First World War meant that the needs of the RAF for heavy bombers could be met by the existing Vickers Vimy, and the last four Londons were cancelled in December 1918. Despite the great expectations placed on the Dragonfly, which had been ordered into large scale production prior to testing being carried out, and formed the powerplant for many of the types planned to equip the Royal Air Force of 1919, the engine was disappointing, with the prototype Londons being delayed by many months before engines were delivered, with the first eventually flying on 13 April 1920, followed by the second in July. Despite its simple structure and angular lines, handling proved excellent, it being possible to remove the ailerons from the lower two sets of wings while not adversely affecting control. Although Folland had designed a civil transport version capable of carrying 13 passengers or heavy loads of cargo or mail, Nieuport and General closed down in August 1920, ending development of the London.

He was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2008. Once a heralded high school athlete, Robinson was an underachiever during his college football career at Rutgers and Akron.https://n.rivals.com/news/judge-farrell-dt-2002-2004 High school career A native of Irvington, New Jersey, Robinson attended Irvington High School, a school that struggled with gang-related violence. As a junior in 2001, he recorded 82 tackles, including 17 tackles for loss, as well as 14 quarterback sacks, nine pass deflections and six caused fumbles. He missed most of his senior season due to a knee injury, but was still rated one of the best defensive lineman in the nation. In fact, Rivals.com gave Robinson their only five-star rating among defensive tackles, and ranked him No. 1 in a class that also included Sedrick Ellis, Marcus Thomas, and Fili Moala.https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/rankings/rank-180 After official visits to Rutgers, Syracuse, and Miami (FL), Robinson committed to the Hurricanes, together with the only other five-star recruit from New Jersey, Greg Olsen of Wayne Hills.Rivals.com New Jersey Top 25 Unlike Olsen, however, Robinson was unable to meet the school's academic qualification standards. Although Robinson's SAT score of 800 met the NCAA minimum for high school students with a 3.0 grade point average, it was 20 points shy of Miami's institutional standard. With the perspective of being declared ineligible, Robinson decided to not enroll at Miami, and instead went to Rutgers. He was the only four- or five-star recruit in Rutgers' class. College career The injury from his high school senior year also caused Robinson to miss the first half of his true freshman year at Rutgers. He only saw action in the final six games of the season, and recorded a total of three tackles and a single quarterback sack‚Äîcoincidentally against the Miami Hurricanes. In his sophomore year, Robinson played in eight of 11 games, including the final six contests, finishing the season with 15 tackles, including five solo stops. In April 2005, he was dismissed for violation of team policy, and eventually transferred to Akron.http://csnbbs.com/showthread.php?tid=53435 After sitting out the 2005 season while fulfilling NCAA transfer requirements, Robinson played 11 of 12 games for the Akron Zips in 2006.

Its royal status the castle received already back in 1385, but in 1432 Medzhybizh with most of Podilia was passed to the Polish Crown. The castle was in a state possession for sometime.

She was involved in the union movement, the consumer movement and the civil rights movement in the mid-20th century. Early life Lucy Randolph Mason was born on the Clarens estate in Virginia near Alexandria July 26, 1882 and grew up near Richmond. Mason was one of five children born to Episcopal minister Landon Mason and his wife Lucy Ambler Mason. She was a fifth-generation descendant of George Mason, author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which was the model for the Bill of Rights. Mason was also related to John Marshall and Robert E. Lee (her father's second cousin). Growing up in the Episcopal Church with a clergyman father and devoted mother developed strong social convictions in Lucy and her siblings. After high school, Mason taught herself stenography while teaching Sunday school classes. It was during this time that she began to be interested in women's rights, specifically voting rights, working towards improving conditions for working people and ending racial injustice, specifically in the South. Career During her 20s while supporting herself as a stenographer, she devoted her free time to volunteer social service work and the suffragette movement. In 1914 the Richmond YWCA offered her a job as its industrial secretary, which she stayed on as until 1918. In 1918, Mason's mother died and she was forced to quit in order to be able to care for her ailing father. During the years that Mason cared for her father she continued to volunteer for the Union Label League and served as president of both the Richmond Equal Suffrage League and the Richmond League of Women Voters. In 1923, Mason's father died and she returned to the YWCA as the general secretary and remained there until 1932. During her time as general secretary she developed a range of innovative programs that were aimed at training and the economic advancement in the lives of both white and black young women and workers in general. With the YWCA Mason generated public support for state labor laws that ensure safe workplaces, end child labor, raise minimum wages, and shorten work hours. Mason also traveled throughout the South during this time promoting voluntary employment agreements that incorporated fair labor standards. To aid this effort she wrote a pamphlet Standards for Workers in Southern Industry (1931), which was the first pamphlet of its kind. She belonged to the Union Label League in Richmond and was a frequent speaker to community and labor groups about the importance of buying union made products and services. During World War I, American Federation of Labor (AFL) President, Samuel Gompers, appointed Mason as the Virginia chairwoman of the Women in Industry Committee, a division of the wartime National Advisory Committee on Labor. She was so successful in her ventures during this time that she drew the interest of other female reformers, Florence Kelly and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Mason made such an impression that Kelly chose her as successor for her role as secretary of the National Consumers League (NCL). In 1932 she was appointed as General Secretary to the NCL, and moved to New York, where she lived for five years; working closely with social workers and recruiting staff for relief and welfare agencies created under the New Deal. It was during this period she met and impressed Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she was friends with for the rest of their lives. From the 1900s to the 1930s, the NCL worked to pass protective labor laws and to convince consumers to buy only goods and services produced by workers who enjoyed a living wage and decent working conditions. Under Mason, the NCL won the passage of new state labor laws, lobbied for improved labor codes in the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act and helped ensure the passage of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  The South and the CIO  In 1937, during congressional hearings on the FLSA, Mason met Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) President, John L. Lewis, who helped arrange a job for her as the CIO's public relations representative for the South. In July 1937, at age 55, Mason moved to Atlanta and started working at the Textile Workers Organizing Committee offices and became the CIO's \\"roving ambassador\\" for the next 16 years. For Mason, the CIO was \\"a training ground for citizenship\\" for Southern workers, a vehicle \\"to bring democracy to the South\\" and the means to alleviate the economic and racial injustices experienced by minorities and the poor. Mason traveled alone to small towns where union organizers and their sympathizers had been shot, beaten, threatened and jailed. She cornered hostile sheriffs, judges, newspaper editors, politicians and ministers, explaining workers' rights to organize and bargain under the new federal statutes and promoting an understanding of the need for unions. She was known by friend and foe as \\"Miss Lucy\\". Her social status as a Southern lady and the daughter of an old, respected Virginia family often gained her access to political and community leaders when others were denied. > You can't get much kosher than that in Virginia, but she kind of had an > interest in working people that most people of that kind of background don't > have...Boy, she was a power. We would all yell for Lucy anytime that we > needed help and she would come into the toughest situations and was great. > She played a tremendous role, a tremendous role. - Myles Horton Miss Lucy's success also rested on her blunt speech, her calm yet steely demeanor and her ability to bring civil liberties violations to the attention of federal officials, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt. For example, Mason convinced Roosevelt to send a special federal investigator to Memphis in 1940 in the wake of physical attacks on the United Rubber Workers' organizers who were trying to create an interracial union. After 1944, Mason worked with the CIO Political Action Committee (\\"CIO-PAC\\") in the South, helping to register union members, black and white, and working for the elimination of the poll tax. She also forged lasting links between labor and religious groups. She helped get the Southern Baptist Convention to adopt a resolution in 1938 recognizing \\"the right of labor to organize and engage in collective bargaining to the end that labor may have a fair and living wage, such as will provide not only the necessities of life, but for recreation, pleasure, and culture.\\" In the 1940s, she organized interfaith, multi-union and interracial groups in Atlanta and other Southern cities of workers dedicated to building bridges between organized labor and the churches. Eventually, these local groups formed the National Religion and Labor Foundation. Mason was dedicated to ending white supremacy in the South, where she was a founding member of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare and she was a frequent speaker at interracial gatherings. In 1952, Lucy Randolph Mason's autobiography was published called To Win These RIghts, which contained an introduction written but her close friend, Eleanor Roosevelt. Then, in 1953, Mason retired from the CIO due to declining health. In 1953, due to ill health, Mason retired from active union work. Then, in 1959, she died in a nursing home in Atlanta.

He is referred to as the Nestor (\\"elder statesman\\") of Danish polar explorers. His archaeological investigations were made in Peary Land and adjacent areas of High Arctic Greenland. Knuth was made a Knight of the Dannebrog. Early years Knuth was born in Klampenborg, near Copenhagen in Denmark. His parents were count Eigil Knuth sr, a captain, and Dijmphna (n√©e Gamel). His hero was the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen who, in 1888, was the first to cross the Greenland ice cap; the trip was financed by State Councillor Augustinus Gamel, a Danish businessman, and Knuth's maternal grandfather. Gamel's birth gift to his grandson was a present Gamel had received from Nansen: the compass Nansen carried on his Greenland icecap expedition. Knuth studied building technology at Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and then woodcarving at Val Gardena in Italy between 1926 and 1928. He published his first book, on the subject of philosophy, in 1927, revealing an affinity with the Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard. In 1932, Knuth graduated as a gymnastics teacher from Ollerup Physical Training College in Denmark. Career Knuth first trip to Greenland occurred in 1932 accompanying Dr. Aage Roussel from the National Museum of Denmark on an archaeological dig to excavate old Norse sites on West Greenland's coast. Knuth spent the next two years as an art critic for the Copenhagen newspaper Dagens Nyheder. Assisting Dr. Roussell and Dr. Poul N√∏rlund during the summer of 1934, Knuth excavated old Norse ruins at Igaliko. In 1935, Dr. Helge Larsen, Ebbe Munck, and Knuth, as archaeologist, assisted on the Augustine Courtauld Expedition to East Greenland, during which Gunnbj√∏rn Fjeld, Greenland's highest mountain, was climbed. The following summer, in 1936, Knuth, Robert Gessain, and Michel Perez participated in the French Trans- Greenland Expedition under Paul-Emile Victor, crossing the Greenland inlandsis (ice cap), starting at Christiansh√•b in the west, and ending at Tasiilaq/Angmagsalik, an Inuit settlement in the east. It was here that Knuth worked as a sculptor, producing a notable series of busts of the local Inuit. Knuth financed the bulk of his next expedition, the Danish Northeast Greenland Expedition, also known as the \\"Danish Northeast Greenland Expedition 1938‚Äî39, sent out by Alf Trolle, Ebbe Munck, and Eigil Knuth in memory of the Denmark Expedition\\" (), arriving in Greenland with his co-leader and friend, Ebbe Munck, on 19 June 1938. The crew consisted of six more men, a. o. the botanist Paul Gelting. It was one of the first Danish Greenland expeditions to make use of an airplane, a de Havilland Tiger Moth.Laursen, pp. 402 With the start of war, Knuth could not return to Greenland as planned, instead, becoming an announcer for Denmark Radio in the Danish resistance movement. During the period of 1948‚Äî50, Knuth was back in Greenland and made several discoveries, including a large tool collection of the Thule culture and tool fragments of the Dorset culture. His most important contribution, however, was the first identification and demonstration of Independence I culture and Independence II culture, immigration waves of Paleo-Eskimo, spread apart by almost 3000 years. He named the cultures \\"Independence\\" after the Independence Fjord located in Peary Land. ;Artist In addition to sculpting, he produced paintings and watercolours. Some of his works were on display at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Later years Knuth's Danish Peary Land Expeditions ended in 1995 with his last visit to Br√∏nlundhus at Br√∏nlund Fjord which served for almost 50 years as his Peary Land expedition headquarters. He died in Copenhagen the following year and he is buried at Bispebjerg Cemetery. Knuth in his old age privately regretted that he did not at some point in his earlier life come out publicly as a homosexual.Mads Lidegaard, ‚ÄòEigil Knuth‚Äô, Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, vol. 8 (Copenhagen, 1981),p 101 Legacy Before his death, Knuth was unable to complete a comprehensive book summarizing his Peary Land archaeological findings. That task fell upon Bjarne Gr√∏nnow, heir to Knuth's archival information. The Northernmost Ruins of the Globe: Eigil Knuth's archaeological investigations in Peary Land and adjacent areas of High Arctic Greenland (2003) is a compilation of Knuth's findings and observations. His portrait busts are in Nuuk.

Overview Most traditional theories of truth are monist: that is, they hold that there is one and only property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth deny this assumption. According to pluralism, ethical propositions might be true by more than one property, for example by virtue of coherence; propositions about the physical world might also be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about. Pluralism, in short, holds out the prospect that propositions might be \\"true in more than one way\\". Crispin Wright is the most well-known advocate of pluralism about truth. In his 1992 book Truth and Objectivity, Wright argued that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility. Michael Lynch (philosopher) has recently advocated a different type of pluralism about truth. In a series of articles and in his 2009 book Truth as One and Many Lynch argues that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.

It was released on November 18, 2008 on CD and re-released on vinyl on May 26, 2009. Background After the release of their 2006 album Floating World, the band was offered a residency as the house band in a north Chicago neighborhood church called Berry United Methodist. A few members, worn out from the band's relentless tour schedule, chose not to relocate from Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. The remaining members, including vocalist Matt Joynt and multi-instrumentalist Bret Wallin, recruited replacements and began work on what would become Canopy Glow. By this point Anathallo had gained a reputation for unique instrumentals, orchestral arrangements, and as many as seven vocalists singing all at once. Having licensed a few songs from Floating World for television commercials, the band was financially secure enough to take a break from touring to write Canopy Glow at their own pace, using the church as their practice space. Female vocalist Erica Froman was brought on as a full-time member of the band at this time. A lyric from \\"The River\\" lends the album its title. Matt Joynt recalls this story of Froman's mother during a hiking trip on the Pacific Crest Trail, saying: \\"She was crossing a river and the current swept her away. Due to the weight of her pack, she couldn't get to a bank and was certain that she was going to die. Upon that realization, she leaned back, calmed her senses and enjoyed what she thought would be her last living moments... she observed everything with a concentrated mindfulness as she passed underneath the glow of light pouring through the canopy of leaves.\\" Though beginning with a song about Joynt's grandfather's funeral (\\"Noni's Field\\") and featuring this somewhat embellished account of a near-death experience Froman's mother endured, the album has a decidedly positive feel, reportedly influenced by the children seen through the church windows playing at the day care next door. The song \\"Bells\\" was inspired by a chance finding the band members came across while rehearsing in the church during the writing process for Canopy Glow. Matt Joynt said: \\"After a few weeks, we noticed seven large black cases sitting in the corner. Lo and behold they were filled with hand bells! In our youth, Bret and I had played in the hand bell choir during Christmas services and weren't afraid to employ them on our record.\\" Recording The band entered Engine Music Studios in Chicago in the Fall of 2007 to begin tracking Canopy Glow, with \\"friend-gineer\\" Neil Strauch directing the process. The band had experienced tension and stress while working on Floating World and were seeking a more relaxed environment to record in. Previous band member Andrew Dost, co-founder of the band fun. was called in as well as other friends and fellow musicians to contribute to the album bringing the total number of musicians to thirteen. Cover art The band borrowed a portion of a painting called Temma on Earth by artist Tim Lowly for use as the cover art for the album. The art piece itself is a huge eight foot by twelve foot acrylic gesso with pigment on panel currently on display at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington. Tim Lowly is married to pastor Sherrie Lowly from the Chicago church that Anathallo wrote the album in. Temma, the subject of the painting, is the Lowlys' daughter.

The name is popular in some Western Slavic and Southern Slavic countries, such as: Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. It means: fighting far away and it is derived from Slavic elements daleko meaning \\"far away\\" and boriti meaning \\"to fight\\".

Born in June 1949 at the Mountain foot of the Liaoning Province Fushun City. He is the 18th generation transmitter of the Dragon Gate Taoism branch of Quanzhen School. Introduction Wang Liping was taught and trained by three Daoist hermits‚ÄîZhang HeDao (Wu-Ji Daoist) who was the 16th generation and Wang JiaoMing (Yin-Ling Daoist) and Jia Jiaoyi (Song-Ling Daoist) who are 17th generation of Dragon Gate branch from Mount Lao of Shandong Province. Wang Liping currently lives in Mainland China. Wang Liping has been known as a Modern Taoist Wizard by the book of Opening the Dragon Gate: The Making of a Modern Taoist Wizard translated by Thomas Cleary. This book was originally written in Chinese and named as Da-Dao-Xing (Opening Dragongate), which describes the process of his training. Wang explained the traditional Daoist training techniques to modern people by using contemporary languages. Master Wang publicly teaches people parts of Ling Bao Bi Fa which is a book about internal alchemy arts written by Zhongli Quan in Han Dynasty. The art of Master Wang's teaching were called \\"Internal alchemy of Ling Bao Intelligence Enlightenment\\". Another book named \\"Xing-Da-Dao (Entering Dragongate)\\", the authors of which book claim that this book summed up Mr. Wang Liping's public teaching in his early years. Recent years, Wang started to not keep the Taoist \\"Inner alchemy\\" secret, and taught openly to domestic and international students (Please see this link for an article titled \\"Wang Liping Teaching Openly - Why is this important ? \\"). It was claimed that Wang thought the thousand year old long lasting of Taoist health teaching were best kept secret and did not clearly indicate the key points, this way is not fair for the modern students.

It lies in the River Irvine below the Rivergate Centre in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The Grannie Stane is clearly visible when the water is low. The GPS co-ordinates are .  Grannie stone A close up view of the Grannie Stone The Grannie Stone (or Granny Stane) is described as \\"One of Irvine's prehistoric puzzles\\", this boulder is either a glacial erratic left behind from the Ice Age or is the last remaining stone of a stone circle - others were removed, by blasting in 1897 and 1899, after the Irvine weir was constructed in 1895, but popular protests saved this remaining stone.Strawhorn, page 2. The weir raised the water level and the stone became therefore became less prominent. The stones had been on the upstream side of the old Irvine Bridge.Love (2009), Page 27 It was also humorously known as 'Paddy's Milestone' after Ailsa Craig due to its supposed resemblance to that island. Origin of the name There has been some speculation as to the origins of the name of the stone, the name may relate to Apollo Grannicus a Romano-British sun God, Grainaig, Grianaig, or GrianLove (2009), Page 28 a Celtic god of the sea or Granos, the god of thermal springs, which is the most unlikely as there is no evidence of thermal springs in the area.Strawhorn, page 6. McJannet relates that Grianaig was a goddess who was transformed into a grey boulder.McJannet, page 377. Unfortunately the origins of the name and perhaps other insight that could be gained from folklore have been lost.Mysterious Britain and Ireland. A Granny stone still exists in Gourock, but on dry land. Uses The stone may simply be a glacial erratic with no archaeological significance and it is not listed by the RCAHMS or mentioned by the outstanding local archaeologist in Victorian times, John Smith.Smith It is not marked on the first edition of the Ordnance Survey map of Irvine. The Puddlie Doodlie ford, the Puddleford, may have an interesting origin of the name is as 'holy steps' ('pas de Dieu'), the stepping stones by which the monks from the Carmelite Priory made their way to Church. Some of the stepping stones may have come from a group of stones later removed, of which the Granny Stane is the last survivor. Use of the Puddleford by horses was prohibited in 1836 to safeguard access to the Puddly Well, one of the public wells. Stepping stones are marked as recently as 1860 on the OS map of Irvine. Strawhorn was of the opinion that the stone was part of a stone circle and also thought that some of the other stones were used in the construction of the Puddleford steps. The Granny stone once served a significant role in the Carters Society's Marymass celebration as they formerly twice circled the stone on their way to the Irvine Moor. This was said to celebrate the crossing of the Irvine at this point by William Wallace in 1297 on his way to attack the English army. This suggests that the stone stood on dry land or in shallower water if the Carters walked round it,Strawhorn, page 192. not unlikely as the weir built in 1895 had raised the water level. The episode in 1297 relates to a punitive expedition under Sir Henry Percy sent to Irvine to quash an armed uprising against the dethronement of John Balliol. The Earl of Carrick, Robert Bruce and others led the Scottish army, however after much argument they decided to submit without a fight. The story became embellished with a purely fanciful involvement of William Wallace in a brave action here.Strawhorn, page 33. A persistent belief is that the River Irvine has changed its course and the area beneath the Saint Inan's church cemetery was once a green holm on which stood a stone circle with the Granny stone as the largest. The others are said to have been swept away by the river and later broken up as previously stated.Strawhorn, page 6.Webster, page 69.

However, it turns out he was innocent the whole time and had no involvement in Homer's kidnapping, thanks to an alibi from Krusty the Clown, who explained that Bob was with him the whole day the time Homer was kidnapped. After suggesting that \\"SB\\" could be anyone, including the Sultan of Brunei and the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, Bob helps them figure out that the keychain actually belongs to their aunts, Patty and Selma Bouvier. Bart and Lisa soon realize that they intentionally kidnapped Homer out of spite for him and have planned to keep him cooped up until Marge forgets about him. Feeling resigned to his fate, Homer reads the wedding vows he wrote for Marge to them. Patty and Selma soon have a change of heart after being touched by his wedding vows. Realizing how much Homer truly loves her, they release him, but not before Bart and Lisa catch up to them. With the keychain as proof of their misdeed, the kids go inside the apartment and confront Patty and Selma for their actions. Bart and Lisa also blackmail their aunts by threatening to tell their mother the truth about their involvement in Homer's kidnapping unless the twins pay for their parents' remarriage ceremony. Patty and Selma reluctantly agree to do so, and Homer and Marge at last get married outside city hall. Cultural references Homer's torture cell and its voice changer reference the Saw film series. The title recalls the phrase \\"heading for disaster\\". The Parson is modeled after singer and actor Bing Crosby. The singing the Parson does is a reference to Crosby's character as Father O'Malley in Going My Way. During a fight between Homer and Marge in front of Maggie, Homer calls Marge Bridezilla because of her behaviour during wedding preparation and arrangements, with Marge retaliating by calling him 'King Wrong'. Maggie then imagines them as King Kong vs. Godzilla. The other \\"S.B.\\"s mentioned by Sideshow Bob are Scott Baio, the Sultan of Brunei and the former Polish secret police the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa. Reception \\"Wedding for Disaster\\" received a Nielsen rating of 3.7/6 and was viewed by 6.58 million viewers.Simpsons Channel  Your Source For Simpsons News Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.3/10, saying, \\"'Wedding for Disaster' was one of those episodes that, while not knocking you down with laughter, was quite fun to watch.\\" He went on to say, \\"it was also sweet to have Homer's recitation of his vows be the turning point for his sisters-in-law. Again, this wasn't a howlingly funny episode, but there were some great parts, and overall 'Wedding for Disaster' was a pleasant enough telling of Marge and Homer's third and fourth weddings.\\" Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: \\"'Wedding for Disaster' worked because it had a cool mystery. Granted, I‚Äôm a sucker for mysteries, but some of the best Simpsons episodes are mysteries‚Äîand most of those feature Sideshow Bob. I was more than ready to let tonight‚Äôs episode turn into the next Sideshow Bob story, but I also like that they let him just be a cameo. Much as I love Kelsey Grammer‚Äôs scheming sidekick, he‚Äôs too smart to have kidnapped Homer for the reason Bart suspected: 'If Mom and Dad don‚Äôt get married, I‚Äôll never be born!' The real solution made a lot more sense, and gave the ending a little more weight. 'Wedding for Disaster' may have been a little light on laughs compared to the last few episodes, but the story carried the day.\\" Awards Joel H.

Impromptu is built around the Scheme language, which is a member of the Lisp family of languages. The source code of its core has been opened as the Extempore project.  Description  The environment allows to make changes to a program at runtime, so variables and functions may be redefined and the changes take effect immediately. A programmer can also create and schedule code for future execution, as well as data events such as notes and graphics objects. Once an event is scheduled, execution continues. Looping is performed by using an idiom called \\"temporal recursion\\" which works by having a function asynchronously schedule a future call to itself as its final action. The library allows communicating with Audio Units for audio synthesis, and with graphics layers such as QuickTime, Quartz, Core Image, OpenGL for video composition. Code written in Objective-C can be called from the editor, and also Objective-C frameworks can perform calls to the Scheme interpreter. Impromptu's Scheme interpreter was initially built from the TinyScheme 1.35 baseline, but it has been substantially modified since to better suit the live coding context. A real-time garbage collector, and Objective-C integration were added. Also, a new statically typed language called the Extempore Language has been integrated to the system. This language is syntactically Scheme-like, but semantically closer to C, and is designed for real-time sound synthesis and other computationally heavy tasks. It provides type inference and is compiled to machine language by LLVM.  Sample performance  A Study in Keith is a live coding performance in Impromptu by Andrew Sorensen. The first two minutes (1:56) are silent, while the performer writes the program that will produce the introduction of the piece. From then on, he modifies the code on the fly to evolve the composition. alt=A Study in Keith: a live coding performance in Impromptu by Andrew Sorensen  Extempore  The core of Impromptu has been released as Extempore under a BSD style licence. It runs under both Linux and Mac OS X. It includes the Scheme interpreter, the Extempore Language compiler and the scheduler. The bindings to Apple libraries are absent, but the environment can interface with dynamic libraries.

Meteorological history Tropical Depression 16W formed 205 nautical miles (375 km) east-southeast of Dong Tac Airport, Vietnam on the morning of 16 September. It reached tropical storm strength overnight local time and was named Vicente, a Chamorro male name. Shortly after forming, Vicente interacted with a tropical disturbance west of Luzon and made a cyclonic loop. Vicente then absorbed the disturbance before passing just south of Hainan Island. Eventually, Vicente tracked into the Vietnam coast northwest of Hu·∫ø on 18 September and gradually dissipated. Preparations China On 17 September, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a standby signal No.1 as the outer bands of Vicente brought showers and thunderstorms to Hong Kong. The signal was dropped the next day as the storm moved away from Hong Kong. Red flags were hoisted at numerous beaches due to the rough seas. Vietnam Ahead of the storm, about 9,000 residents evacuated inland while others worked to protect the thousands of dykes along the shore. Thailand In anticipation of severe flooding in the capital city of Bangkok, about 2,000 water pumps and 1.7 million sandbags were deployed to prevent significant flooding and to minimize the flooding from nearby rivers. Large forklift trucks were sent to ten stations set up around the city to assist any large trucks which might run into trouble during the storm. An additional 130 smaller forklifts were provided to assist smaller vehicles. A total of seven million sandbags were stockpiled for use around the country. Impact China Tropical Storm Vicente brought showers and thunderstorms to southern China but had little impact. Rough seas produced by the storm caused the drownings of two swimmers in Ham Tin Wan of Sai Kung. The lowest pressure recorded was 1010.4 hPa (mbar) on September 17. The rough seas also led to a Chinese ship striking a reef. All 17 crew members were rescued. Vietnam Vicente dropped heavy rains throughout Vietnam, notably peaking at 310 mm (12.2 in) in S∆°n La, 198 mm (7.7 in) in Tam ƒê·∫£o District, and 164 mm (6.4 in) in H√≤a B√¨nh. Upwards of 150 mm (5.9 in) fell within 30 hours in northern areas of the county. The rains led to increased water levels in the Thao River, which threatened to overflow and flood several villages. In Thanh H√≥a Province, an estimated 1,600 homes collapsed and 9,700 dykes were damaged. Large expanses of rice fields were submerged in floodwaters. In H√† Tƒ©nh Province, a total of 3,500 homes were submerged by floodwaters and an additional 450 residences were evacuated. An additional 3,000 homes were damaged and 250 were destroyed in other areas throughout Vietnam. A landslide in Y√™n B√°i Province killed three people and injured five others. Flooding destroyed a bridge in Duong Quy and inundated a newly built school. A boy in Qu·ª≥nh L∆∞u District was killed when a tree, knocked down by the storm, fell on him. A total of 40,000 hectares (98,842 acres) of farmland was lost due to the storm. Damages totaled to ‚Ç´55 billion (US$3.48 million). In all, at least 20 people were killed by the storm. Thailand The remnants of Vicente dropped heavy rains over drought- stricken areas of Thailand.

Svirz Castle (, ) is a fortified aristocratic residence in Svirzh, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. It was originally built by the ≈öwirski noble family in the 15th century. Inside the castle is a small church dating from 1546. The stronghold was completely rebuilt in the 17th century at the behest of its new owner, Count Aleksander Cetner. It is believed that General Pawe≈Ç Grodzicki was responsible for the modernisation of the castle's fortifications. Though surrounded on all sides by moats, lakes, and marshes, the fort was taken by the rebellious Cossacks on several occasions. In 1648, the Turks set it on fire; they were less successful during the Lwow raid of 1672. The castle stood in ruins for many years. It was restored in 1907, only to be devastated by fire in 1914.

Plot Mary, an amnesiac young woman, wakes in a hospital and cannot remember who she is, what has happened to her, or even simple things such as how to blow her nose or what clouds are. She leaves the hospital and takes the name \\"Mary Lamb\\" after overhearing a nursery rhyme. Mary befriends a woman named Sharon, an alcoholic who seems well-meaning to the na√Øve Mary until she prostitutes her for money. After enduring painful sex, Mary smashes the man's mouth in once he passes out. She flees, coming into contact with a policeman named Prince, who knows about Mary's past. Mary lives for a while with Sharon's parents, also alcoholics, but eventually she moves into a shelter for \\"fallen women.\\" She receives a letter from Prince that includes a newspaper clipping concerning her before she lost her memory. Mary learns that her real name is Amy Hide and that her past was quite dark, a fact which causes Mary a great deal of distress. During her stay at the shelter, she gets a job as a waitress in a seedy caf√©. With one exception, all of the male employees sexually harass her, but she does not understand the significance of their actions. The exception is Alan, a meek and highly insecure man who is deeply infatuated with Mary but does nothing to ward off the attentions of others. Mary meets Prince again, and she learns that Amy had asked someone to kill her. According to Prince, the failed killing was what had caused her amnesia. The man who did it is behind bars but due to be released. When Alan and another coworker, the cocksure but illiterate Russ, find out where Mary lives, they are appalled and ask her to join them at their squat. Alan appears tortured by her presence and by the continued kisses and fondling she receives from other men, particularly Russ. To comfort him, Mary begins sleeping with Alan. This does not seem pleasant for either of them, and after a while Mary decides to break their relationship off. In response, Alan hangs himself. Mary goes to see a man named Michael, whom she finds out she had dated before she lost her memory. Pretending to be Amy's cousin, she asks Michael about the things that Amy did to him. Amy, according to him, was abusive, vindictive, and unfaithful. She is escorted out of Michael's office by his assistant, Jamie, who takes pity on the shabby-looking Mary and invites her to live with him. Jamie is extremely wealthy, and he squanders his wealth largely on drugs and alcohol. Mary becomes infatuated with Jamie and is crushed when he does not return her affection. The two eventually begin a sexual relationship, but it is clear that Jamie does not return Mary's love. After their relationship ends, Mary moves in with Prince and begins going by Amy. They slowly develop a relationship, one that is deeper than any other that Amy has experienced in the course of the novel. One night, Prince informs Amy that her would-be killer has been released, and that she must confront him. It is never directly revealed who the killer is, although it is implied to be Prince. The confrontation scene ends ambiguously‚Äîit is unclear if Mary is finally killed. The next scene recalls the opening lines of the novel, but it is not certain whether this is a recapitulation, an event that happened in Mary's past, or what occurred after the confrontation scene. Style The book starts as a comedy, slips into a thriller, and ends a horror story. Amis saw the novel as a kind of overall investigation. \\"Mary (the main character) doesn't know what her role is,\\" Amis explained in 1981.Judy Dempsey, The Irish Times, \\"In Search of Realism,\\" 31 March 1981 \\"Because of this, men start questioning their own attitudes towards women, and even about themselves. When one's role is undermined, you begin to look at everything around you in a different light.\\" Though narrated in the third person, the book's descriptions seem to come from Mary's point of view; because the world around her is completely alien, the descriptions are often bizarre, childlike, and (particularly in the very beginning) somewhat difficult to understand. This can sometimes make for poignant tragic irony‚Äîit is often clear to the readers, but not to Mary, that other characters do not mean well. This is true, for example, of the scene where Sharon prostitutes Mary for money, or of the repeated scenes of sexual harassment that Mary endures at the caf√© where she works. Reception The book was well received in Britain and the United States. The writer J.G. Ballard called Other People \\"Powerful and electrifying... 'Other People' is a metaphysical thriller, Kafka reshot in the style of Psycho.\\" Writing in Britain's The Guardian, poet, writer and critic Anthony Thwaite spoke the novel's \\"enormous confidence of address,\\" continuing, \\"Other People is 'about' a descent into Hell, Hell being 'other people'-- it's a very strange and impressive performance.\\"Anthony Thwaite, The Guardian, \\"Season in Hell\\", 8 March 1981 The Times found \\"For all its savagery... Other People is a funny book... an achievement light years ahead of his earlier novels.\\"The Times, \\"Other People,\\" 5 March 1981 Judy Dempsey wrote in The Irish Times, \\"Amis has done something important in 'Other People.'\\"Judy Dempsey, The Irish Times, \\"In Search of Realism,\\" 31 March 1981 In the Los Angeles Times, Charles Champlin called Amis \\"an English literary celebrity who, like Norman Mailer and Truman Capote here, finds himself in the columns more often than some film stars,\\" and found the book, \\"an ingenious and mischievous piece of writing, nothing like a mystery with a tidy ending...a tour de force.\\"Charles Champlin, The Los Angeles Times, \\"A beguiling baffler without neat ends,\\" 21 June 1981 Composition Other People is the first book Amis completed after choosing to become a full-time fiction-writer; he had been on-staff at the New Statesman until 1979. Amis told an interviewer \\"I wanted to leave to devote myself to full-time writing. It was the responsibility of doing something else, not wholly connected with my writing that exhausted me from writing what I wanted. I enjoyed it, but I felt writing was more important.\\"Judy Dempsey, The Irish Times, \\"In Search of Realism,\\" 31 March 1981 Further reading  References  External links  *Narrative and narrated homicide in Martin Amis's Other People and London Fields (Brian Finney) *Review on The Fiction Circus Category:Novels by Martin Amis Category:1981 British novels Category:Jonathan Cape books ","title":"Other People (novel)"},{"id":"21614177","text":"Venha-Ver (lit. \\"come see\\") is the westernmost city in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte.

It is an example of the Belarusian Gothic and one of the first fortified churches in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania along with the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Muravanka. History There is a legend that the church was built by Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, in honour of his marvellous escape from his cousin, Jogaila, when they were at war. In reality the church was built in 16th century. The foundation could have been done by Konstanty Ostrogski, who reconstructed similar church in Vilnius in 1511 ‚Äì 1522. After the Union of Brest, the church became subordinate to the Holy See. After Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was partitioned the parish stayed active, but after November Uprising the church was converted into the Eastern Orthodox. In 1880‚Äì1881, the temple was significantly reconstructed. In 1926 it was rebuilt as a Catholic church by the government of the Second Polish Republic. In 1988‚Äì1990, it was turned into the Orthodox again. Architecture The church is an example of the Belarusian Gothic architecture. Its internal space is divided into the three naves supported by four pillars. The plan of the building is close to a square and has three apses on the east side. The walls are one and a half meters thick. There are four defence towers on the corners of the church. The upper part of the western towers is made in the shape of octagon with three levels of arrowslits. Two eastern towers are cylindrical and also have arrowslits in the upper part. The pediment has a number of niches varying in depth and size.

During the ERN period, the City and the developer will develop a Disposition and Development Agreement (DDA) that will define the project, address all key terms and describe the transfer and sale of the property. The mixed-use project components described in the ERN are contemplated in general to include: Commercial retail space; Office space; Community lawn and kayaking center, and a long-term plan for the pier; Shoreline park, open space areas and trail; Preservation and adaptive reuse of the Winehaven Historic District buildings; Residential space (estimated to be approximately 1,200 residential units; the actual number may differ and will be determined through the entitlement process; Preservation/adaptive reuse of Winehaven Historic District; improved public waterfront access; beach park, open space, and Bay Trail enhancement with pedestrian/bike-friendly design; and meet the City's public art, local hire and living wage requirements. The eventual DDA would commit the developer to provide at least 67 affordable units on-site. Any additional affordability requirements would be satisfied by on-site units or in-lieu fees under the City's Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.

Biography  Walter Tracy was born in Islington, London and attended Shoreditch Secondary school. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to the large printing firm William Clowes as a compositor. When he had completed his apprenticeship, Tracy went to work in the typographic studio of The Baynard Press, a printing house. From 1938 to 1946, Tracy had been rejected by the army's medical examination, he worked in an advertising agency as a print buyer. From 1947 Tracy began to work part- time for the British Linotype & Machinery Ltd. (L&M;) company, a subsidiary of Mergenthaler Linotype. The following year he was hired as a full-time employee by L&M;, where he was going to spend the following 30 years. There he became involved with designing typefaces for newspapers, and classified advertising. His typeface Jubilee, designed to be more robust than Stanley Morison's 1931 font Times New Roman, was adopted by a number of newspapers, and his Telegraph Modern was used by the Daily Telegraph from 1967. From the mid-1950s Tracy was also responsible for a range of influential Arabic type developments, among them the making of the Mrowa-Linotype Simplified Arabic type in collaboration with Kamel Mrowa and Nabih Jaroudi. In 1967 Tracy supervised a team steered by L&M;'s representative Hrant Gabeyan that developed the first computer for automated Arabic character selection and justification. The resulting system was developed in collaboration with the Compugraphic Corporation, and was first installed at the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram. It became an influential model for later systems such as the phonetic keyboard for Indian scripts developed by Linotype-Paul Ltd. In 1972 Tracy was asked by The Times to design a replacement for Times New Roman. The resulting type was named Times Europa, and was adopted by The Times in late 1972. In 1973 he was elected a Royal Designer for Industry. Tracy retired in 1977 but remained active, designing a range of Arabic typefaces for Linotype, Letraset and Bitstream. In the same period he also designed a Hebrew font, under a pseudonym. Whilst some of his papers are held at the Type Museum, London, his correspondence files, documenting the development of numerous important typefaces, are held at the Department of Typography & Graphic Communication, University of Reading. Walter was married to Frances Tracy for many years. They latterly lived at \\"Cedar Court\\" in Finchley, London, a Grade II listed 1920s building. He died on 28 April 1995.

Pomoriany Castle (, ) is a ruined castle in the village of Pomoriany, Zolochiv District, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. It originated in the 16th century as a well-fortified noble residence on the bank of the Zolota Lypa River. The castle's early owners included Mikolaj ≈öwinka and Jan Sienie≈Ñski. The estate suffered badly at the hands of the Cossacks and Turks (1675, 1684) but Jan III Sobieski invested in the restoration in order to make Pomorzany one of his country residences. Sobieski's death in 1696 was followed by another long period of decline. A real change came about in the castle's fortunes when, in 1789, Erasm Pruszy≈Ñski started transforming the dilapidated building into a modern residence. He had the barbican gate, three towers and several wings of the old structure torn down, however. As recently as 1939, Pomorzany was owned by the famous Potocki family. Following the September Campaign, the building was adapted for use as a school, but it was finally abandoned to rot in the late 1970s.

Plot John wakes up on a couch and he and his wife begin arguing about a mistake he made with another woman. The wife is ready to kick him out but he desperately tries to make amends. John goes to work and it is revealed he is a miner and just received word that he is to report to the junction, which hasn't seen anything productive in years. Once he and some fellow miners go in the team gets lost and sends some of the others back to find out where they are. Before long, a cave-in traps John. After the dust settles, John starts hearing another voice - another trapped miner he assumes. He finds the man but he has a broken leg so John gives him a hand. The other miner's name is Ray and is inquisitive about John's digital watch and the flashlight on his helmet. After an argument over the fact that John is black and discussions about the union it's apparent that Ray believes it's September 16, 1912. At the church on September 16, 1986, the reverend is approached by a woman who claims that a letter that has been at the church for sixty years, addressed to Melissa Parker, John's wife, that was supposed to be delivered the day before. Back in the mine, Ray and John are panicking and trying to find a way out, while the miners outside are trying to find a way in to help. Ray and John start talking about their families and lives. The reverend delivers the letter (which Ray wrote), allowing Melissa to learn what happened to John. She goes to the mine foreman and pleads with him to change where they are looking, in order to follow the instructions in the letter, so they can find where John really is.

The airfield is located in Washuk District and nestled in a barren desert valley between two ridges of the Central Makran Range approximately 21 miles (35 km) southeast of the village of Washuk. Shrouded in secrecy, Shamsi was leased by Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates in 1992http://tribune.com.pk/story/304717/last-plane- home-fc-caa-officials-reach-shamsi-base/ for game hunting purposes and, between 20 October 2001 and 11 December 2011, it was leased to the United States for use as a base for joint Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and United States Air Force (USAF) surveillance and drone operations (particularly those involving Predator drones) against militants in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The United States was ordered to vacate the airfield by the Pakistani Government on 26 November 2011 after the Salala Incident in which US-led NATO forces attacked two Pakistani border checkposts in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas killing 24 Pakistan Army soldiers. The United States vacated the airfield on 11 December 2011. Satellite image of Shamsi showing Predator drones on a parking ramp. History Lease by the United Arab Emirates (1992‚Äì2001) The disused Bhandari Airstrip was leased to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by the Government of Pakistan in 1992 for game hunting, particularly that of falconry and rare Bustards in Balochistan province, by members of the UAE royal families. The airstrip, which was renamed \\"Shamsi\\" (meaning \\"Solar\\" in Arabic) by the Emirati Sheikhs, was developed into a jet capable airfield by the UAE.Khan, Air Marshal (Retd.) Ayaz Ahmed, \\"Shamsi Air Base\\", Defence Journal, November 2007, Volume 11, No. 4, Karachi, Pakistan Lease by the United States (2001‚Äì2011) At the request of the United States, Shamsi was sub- leased by the UAE to the United States on 20 October 2001 with the approval of then Pakistani Government of President Pervez Musharraf and was further developed jointly by the CIA and the USAF as a military airfield. The US constructed two permanent and one portable hangars at Shamsi for housing drones, in addition to support and residential facilities, and recarpeted the asphalt runway to enable its use by large and heavy military aircraft. On the night of 9 January 2002, a United States Marine Corps KC-130R refuelling aircraft crashed after hitting a ridgeline on approach to Shamsi, possibly due to crew disorientation, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members on board.http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20020109-0 In February 2009, The Times (London) claimed that it had obtained Google Earth images from 2006 that showed Predator drones parked outside a hangar at the end of the runway at Shamsi. The Times investigation was in response to a statement by US Senator Dianne Feinstein that the CIA was basing its drone aircraft in Pakistan. The US company Blackwater was also reported to have a presence there, hired by the government to arm the drones with missiles. The Pakistani Government had initially denied that the airfield was being used as a base for US military or covert operations but confirmed the same later. The New York Times cited a senior Pakistani military official as saying that in 2009 the drone operations were moved across the border to Afghanistan. US friction with Pakistan and eviction (2011) On 13 May 2011, following the Abbotabad Incident of 2 May 2011, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, Chief of the Air Staff, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) confirmed, in an in-camera briefing to a joint sitting of the Pakistani Parliament, that Shamsi was not under the control of the PAF, but under UAE control.

Education Clelia Duel Mosher, 1892 Mosher attended Wellesley College, the University of Wisconsin, and Stanford University, where she received a bachelor's degree in zoology in 1893. In 1894, she received a master's degree from Stanford. In 1896, Mosher became a student at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Mosher's Master's degree thesis disproved the then widely held belief that women were physically inferior to men because they could only breathe costally, showing instead it was only women‚Äôs fashionable corset clothing of the time that prevented diaphragmatic breathing. She found that women would breathe with their diaphragm with enough exercise. Career Fannie Brown Patrick, Anne Jennings Kluegel, Clelia G. Mosher, Mrs. B.F. Chappelle.jpg After her graduation as a doctor of medicine, Mosher worked in private practice, until she became an assistant professor of personal hygiene at Stanford in 1910.

It is the only known existing survey of Victorian women's sexual habits, and was initially controversial because of its frankness and the overwhelmingly sex-positive views of the participants, even including the use of \\"male sheaths\\" (now called condoms) and \\"rubber cap over the uterus\\" (either a diaphragm or cervical cap) birth control.Gershaw: The First Sex SurveyHyde: Understanding Human Sexuality p. 5 All this stood in high contrast to other existing historical literature of the time which held that women have no sexual desires and sex should only be used for reproduction. One theory is because the researcher was a woman gathering data from women that knew the results would only be put forth before a purely female audience, the normal strictures of propriety of that time were let down and more realistic data was actually gathered.

UB-9 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. UB-9 was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launched and commissioned as SM UB-9 in February 1915.\\"SM\\" stands for \\"Seiner Majest√§t\\" () and combined with the U for Unterseeboot would be translated as His Majesty's Submarine. UB-9s commanding officer at commissioning only remained in charge of the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more commanding officers assigned through the end of the war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. UB-9 was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, UB-9 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Dr√§ger at L√ºbeck in 1919.  Design and construction  After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders.Miller, pp. 46‚Äì47.Karau, p. 48. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.A further refinement of the design‚Äîreplacing the torpedo tubes with mine chutes but changing little else‚Äîevolved into the Type UC I coastal minelaying submarine. See: Miller, p. 458. UB-9 was the first of the initial allotment of seven submarines‚Äînumbered up to ‚Äîordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.Williamson, p. 12. UB-9 was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 6 November. As built, UB-9 was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single K√∂rting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, UB-9 was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds. UB-9 was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. UB-9s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.Karau, p. 49. After work on UB-9 was complete at the Weser yard, she was launched on 6 February 1915.  Career  The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-9 on 18 February 1915 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wilhelm Werner, a 26-year-old first-time U-boat commander. Wenninger was only in command of UB-9 for ten days. Sources do not indicate who, if anyone, succeeded him as commander of UB-9, or if UB-9 remained in commission. According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, UB-9 had been assigned to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 63. Uboat.net reports that UB-9' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which may indicate that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel. At the end of the war, the Allies required all German U-boats to be sailed to Harwich for surrender. UB-9 was one of eight U-boats deemed unseaworthy and allowed to remain in Germany.Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 331‚Äì32.The other seven boats were , , , , and three fellow Type UB I boats, , , and .

The charge calculation methods based on fitting of molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) (including CHELPG) are not well-suitable for the treatment of larger systems, where some of the innermost atoms are located far away from the points at which the MESP is computed. In such a situation, variations of the innermost atomic charges will not lead to significant changes of the MESP outside of the molecule, which means accurate values for the innermost atomic charges are not well-determined by the MESP outside of the molecule. This problem is solved by density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) methods that partition the electron density cloud in order to provide chemically meaningful net atomic charges that approximately reproduce the electrostatic potential surrounding the material. It should be remembered that atomic charges depend on the molecular conformation. The representative atomic charges for flexible molecules hence should be computed as average values over several molecular conformations. A number of alternative MESP charge schemes have been developed, such as those employing Connolly surfaces or geodesic point selection algorithms, in order to improve rotational invariance by increasing the point selection density and reducing anisotropies in the sampled points on the MESP surface. While CHELPG is restricted to non-periodic (e.g., molecular) systems, the DDEC methods can be applied to both non-periodic and periodic materials. CHELPG charges can be computed using the popular ab initio quantum chemical packages such as Gaussian, GAMESS-US and ORCA.

Stewart was originally inspired to create the adaptation during the production of the 1986 film Lady Jane. It is performed without costumes or props, and has Stewart playing more than 30 characters. Critics have praised Stewart's portrayal and compared them to the readings performed by Dickens during the 19th century.  Background  A Christmas Carol is a novella by English writer Charles Dickens, first published on 19 December 1843. It has been adapted into a variety of mediums, with the first theater production taking place in London within six weeks of publication. The run lasted for 40 nights before transferring to the Park Theatre in New York City. In 1853, Dickens began to perform the story itself in public, performing each of the characters himself without props or costume changes. He continued to make these occasional recitals until his final public performance on 15 March 1870. Patrick Stewart first became influenced by the story during the production of his 1986 film Lady Jane. In a break between filming, he discovered that he had read all the newspapers and magazines he had available in his hotel. However, it had a small library available to guests. Stewart picked up an old copy of A Christmas Carol, having realised that while he was familiar with the story, he had never read it. He compared the major theme of redemption in the story to those he had previously seen in the works of William Shakespeare.  Production  Stewart began developing an adaptation of the story to be performed in a one-man show. The then-three hour performance was only performed in public at the parish church in Mirfield, West Yorkshire in support of their church organ restoration. It wasn't until during the production of the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation two years later that Stewart began to work on re-developing it into a shorter but still full-length solo performance. He took his work to Professor Albert Hutter, a Dickens scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, for reassurance that he hadn't made any mistakes in his adaptation. His first performance was in Hutter's home in front of around 18 people, and he found the response encouraging. During the course of the play, Stewart acts as more than 30 characters. Out of all of them, he found the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come the most difficult, saying that, as written, \\"he's a pointing hand and little else\\". There are no props or costume changes, although he tried using a glass of water as a prop in a single performance. Stewart compared the overall experience of performing A Christmas Carol to a roller coaster and a merry-go- round at the same time because of the pace of it. He added that \\"Technically, vocally and physically, it's very demanding, because I'm on my feet a lot\\", requiring him to train for physical fitness in order to be able to deliver the performance on a repeated basis. He performed the play at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium during several Christmas seasons. Stewart then took the play to New York City in 1991 for 16 performances. The success of that run resulted in him receiving the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show, and a further run in the city during 1992 for 24 more performances. This also led to Stewart and A Christmas Carol being featured on the front cover of Starlog, typically a science fiction magazine, due to the actor's links to The Next Generation. In 1993, the production toured during December, and Stewart performed at several locations including the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts and in London at the Old Vic Theatre. He returned to New York for the fourth time in 2001 with a further eight performances at the Marquis Theatre on Broadway, the takings of which all went to charity such as Actors Fund of America, the Coalition for the Homeless and Food for Survival, Inc. A further run of 23 performances at the Old Vic occurred in 2005, replacing the poorly received Ducktastic which had been due to run until the following year.  Reception  Following the start of the initial New York run in 1991, Mel Gussow wrote for The New York Times that Stewart's one-man version restored A Christmas Carol to the original \\"full narrative splendor\\" as well as showing both the humour and humanity present. Stewart's performance was compared to the original Dickens recitals, and the reviewer said that it made them want to see the actor perform other Dickens classics too. Nancy Churnin reviewed the play for the Los Angeles Times in 1993, saying that Stewart was \\"able to fill the stage all the more richly with his own penetrating and versatile voice, his mastery of gesture, and facial expressions that instantly summon fear, delight, longing and awe.\\" He added that the actor's performance prevented Ebenezer Scrooge from being seen as a \\"caricature\\" but instead as a \\"Everyman whose sins are present in most of us to varying degrees.\\" Critics reviewing the 2005 run in London at the Albery Theater included Maxie Szalwinska for the Metro, who said that the play was \\"a reminder that you don't need angel-voiced choirs, a cute Tiny Tim hobbling around on crutches or lashings of fake snow and tinsel to make a satisfying Christmas show. The most important ingredient is a cracking story, well told.\\" She praised the performance and added that it made her want to read more Dickens instead of watching television over the festive season. Lyn Gardner, while writing for The Guardian, praised the usage of the original text and said that Stewart's means of saying the classic \\"Bah humbug\\" line was \\"sheer brilliance\\". She said that the storytelling was \\"nicely done\\" and that Stewart showed Scrooge as a man \\"who has constructed a prison of loneliness and erected bars around his own heart\\".

Fl√¥ne Abbey. The Abbey of Fl√¥ne, Belgium, is located on the banks of the Meuse River at Fl√¥ne (Amay), in the province of Li√®ge (Belgium). It was founded in 1075. History In 1075, three lay brothers decided to devote themselves to the religious life and established themselves on land donated by Henry I of Verdun, Bishop of Li√®ge, near the village of Fl√¥ne. The site would serve as a convenient resting-place for travelers on the Tongres-Amay-Arlon road, and the lay brothers built a water mill and an oratory dedicated to Saint Matthew. In 1189, the site became an abbey and became associated with the order of the Augustinian regular canons. A brewery was established in 1550 during the administration of Abbot Philippe d'Orjo (d. 1555), whose tomb is conserved in the church. In 1568, the abbey was plundered and destroyed by the Calvinist troops of William the Silent. Thomas de Vinalmont (1608‚Äì1623) built the dovecote, porch, and mill, and under the Abbot Guillaume de Hemricourt (1636‚Äì1670) and his nephew Abbot Dieudonn√© de Hemricourt (1670‚Äì1692), the church, convent, and tour d'angle (junction tower) were built, the last of which became the emblematic image of the old abbey. These buildings formed a double court, at the center of which can be found the church of Saint-Matthieu. The Church of Saint-Matthieu, formerly the abbey church and now the parish church of Fl√¥ne, contains five tombstones, of black marble, dedicated to various prelates of Fl√¥ne; 17th century baptismal fonts; 17th century choral stalls; and two tableaux by Jean Del Cour (1631‚Äì1707) on the walls of the apse. These tableaux depict Saint Matthew and St. Augustine of Hippo. The church also contains a pipe organ built in 1710 by Karel Dillens. The church also contains a reliquary associated with the remains associated with St. Denise, an early Christian martyr. The relics are visible through small openings; in the modern era this saint is invoked for protection against bicycle and motorcycle accidents and headaches. Dovecote and church of Saint-Matthieu Denise's relics were brought to the Abbey of Fl√¥ne in 1922, and a vase associated with the saint contains her crystallized blood. A second vase contains earth said to have been drenched with the blood of Christian martyrs. On the sarcophagus is embedded a marble tablet said to come from Roman catacombs; it carries the inscription: DIONISE, V.M..I.IN.P VIX. AN. XXIX. (Denise, celebrated virgin martyr rests in peace. She lived 29 years). In the 18th century, Jean-Jerome de Schroots (1725‚Äì1742) added a tithe house (maison de la d√Æme) and his successor Charles Delvaux de Fenffe rebuilt the abbatial palace. Fl√¥ne acquired a vast domain and the rights associated with its lands, which included various farms and privileges regarding forests and fisheries. In 1796, control of the abbey was assumed by the French revolutionary authorities; its lands and goods were confiscated and sold to private individuals. In 1921, the order known as the Ladies of Christian Education (Dames de l'instruction chr√©tienne) acquired Fl√¥ne Abbey and made it their principal house. A boarding school for young girls was opened at the abbey. The institution later introduced co-education. A footbridge was built, which connected it with Ch√¢teau Goffart (built in 1905). There was a fire at the abbey in December 2007, which damaged some of the old woodwork. In 2019, the elementary school at the abbey had more than 500 pupils; there were more than 1000 pupils at the secondary level.

He was the first professor of anaesthetics outside the United States. Early life Macintosh was baptised with the Maori name Rewi Rawhiti. He was the youngest son of Charles Nicholson Macintosh, newspaper editor and mayor of Timaru in 1901, and his wife, Lydia Beatrice Thompson. He spent part of his childhood in Argentina, but returned to New Zealand when he was thirteen years old. He was educated at Waitaki Boys' High School, where he was head of school and excelled academically and athletically. In December 1915, he travelled to Britain and was commissioned in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, soon transferring to the Royal Flying Corps. He was shot down behind enemy lines on 26 May 1917 and taken prisoner, escaping several times. Medical pediatric, infant, and neonate) Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh & his wife Dorothy (n√©e Manning) After the war, Macintosh trained at Guys Hospital Medical School, qualifying MRCS LRCP in 1924 and FRCS Ed in 1927. While studying surgery, he earned a living by giving dental anaesthetics and developed an interest in anaesthetics. In 1936, the University of Oxford approached Lord Nuffield to consider endowing three chairs in medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynaecology. Nuffield, who had received an anaesthetic from Macintosh, agreed, but against the university's wishes, insisted on the addition of a chair in anaesthetics, to be held by Macintosh. They could not ignore the ¬£2 million on offer and Macintosh took up his appointment in February 1937, the first professor of anaesthetics outside America. In the Second World War, Macintosh held the rank of Air Commodore and trained anaesthetists for the armed services. His research included hazardous experiments to test life jackets (immersing E A Pask in a wave tank while anaesthetised), the provision of respirable atmospheres in submarines and survival during parachute descent from high altitudes. Macintosh designed equipment that now bears his name: a laryngoscope, an anaesthetic vaporiser, spray and endobronchial tube. The laryngoscope he designed in 1941 remains the most-used today. It was developed from a Boyle-Davis mouth gag, used for tonsillectomy. Macintosh noted that this mouth gag indirectly elevated the epiglottis and exposed the laryngeal aperture. Macintosh studied unexplained deaths that occurred under anaesthesia and established a training programme. He travelled widely, giving demonstrations of \\"safe and simple\\" anaesthesia. Macintosh married Dorothy Manning, whose sister Mary, was married to Archie Forbes. Honours Macintosh was knighted in 1955, and received many honorary doctorates and fellowships.

Setting Arkansas The Razorbacks stormed into Dallas after winning all ten games the Southwest Conference title. The Hogs defeated #1 Texas 14‚Äì13 in Austin to clinch the bowl berth, and the conference championship. Longhorn head coach Darrell Royal went for two in the game and failed, giving the game, conference, bowl bid, and later the national crown to the Razorbacks. Razorback guard Ronnie Caveness was named an All-American. Ken Hatfield again led the nation in punt return yards, with 518. Tom McKnelly scored 45 points kicking 27 extra points and 6 field goals, which tied him with LSU's Doug Moreau for fourth place nationally. Arkansas entered the bowl season on a sour note, with losses in major bowl games in January 1961, 1962, and 1963; they didn't play in a bowl the previous season due to their 5‚Äì5 record. Nebraska Under third-year head coach Bob Devaney, Nebraska won its first nine games and was fourth in the rankings, but lost 17‚Äì7 at rival Oklahoma on November 21, which snapped a sixteen-game winning streak. The Huskers' previous bowl trips were split at 2‚Äì2, with both wins in the last two seasons. Game summary This was the first-ever meeting between the two programs. Arkansas' number-one rated defense was giving up only 5.7 points per game, while Nebraska's #7 offense was scoring 24.9 points per contest. A standing room only crowd watched as Arkansas opened the scoring on a Tom McKnelly field goal in the first quarter. Nebraska responded in the second, with Harry Wilson punching it into the end zone from one yard out for a touchdown, giving the Huskers a 7‚Äì3 lead at halftime. The third quarter passed with no scoring. Fred Marshall took over at quarterback for the Razorbacks in the fourth quarter and engineered an 80-yard drive with little time left on the game clock. Marshall pitched to running back Bobby Burnett, who scampered in from the three-yard line for the game's final touchdown, giving Arkansas a 10-7 victory. It was their first win in a major bowl and their first bowl win in four years. Aftermath The Razorbacks were selected as national champions by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation, after the Alabama Crimson Tide lost their bowl game against the Texas Longhorns in the Orange Bowl. Arkansas defeated Texas in Austin earlier in the season. Because the final major polls (AP and Coaches (UPI)) were released in early December before bowl games were played, the Crimson Tide was selected national champions. Because of the controversy, the AP Poll decided to wait until after the bowl games to select their champion in the 1965 season.

(The dates 22 June 1907 and 24 October 1994 also appear in some sources.Campbell, Margaret (11 November 1994) Obituary: Gioconda de Vito. The Independent (London, England)) Life De Vito was born, one of five children, in the town of Martina Franca in southern Italy, to a wine-making family. Initially she played the violin untaught, having received only music theory lessons from the local bandmaster. Her uncle, a professional violinist based in Germany, heard her attempting a concerto by Charles Auguste de B√©riot when she was aged only eight, and decided to teach her himself. At age 11, she entered the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro to study with Remy Principe. She graduated at age 13, commenced a career as a soloist, and at age 17 became Professor of Violin at the newly founded conservatory in Bari. In 1932, aged 25, she won the first International Violin Competition in Vienna. After she played the Bach Chaconne in D minor, Jan Kubel√≠k came up to the stage and kissed her hand (she later appeared under the baton of Kubelik‚Äôs son Rafael Kubel√≠k). She then taught at Palermo and Rome, at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia. She had earlier been presented to Benito Mussolini, who greatly admired her playing, and he used his influence to get her the Rome post. World War II interrupted what would otherwise have been the most productive period of her burgeoning career. In 1944, she was given the unique honour of a lifetime professorship at the Academy. In 1944, de Vito premiered the Violin Concerto of Ildebrando Pizzetti. She made the first of her relatively few recordings for EMI/HMV after the war. She made her London debut in 1948 under Victor de Sabata, playing the Brahms concerto. This was very successful, and led to performances at the Edinburgh Festival and with fellow artists such as Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern and Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. By 1953, she was considered Europe's No. 1 female violinist, while remaining virtually unknown in the United States. De Vito played under Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler a number of times, and had a great affinity for his approach. In 1953 they also played a Brahms sonata at Castel Gandolfo for Pope Pius XII, the choice of Brahms being the Pope's own request. In 1957 de Vito played the Mendelssohn concerto for the Pope. A member of the audience later sent her a letter saying that he was no longer an atheist, because her playing of the slow movement had made him realise there must be a God. During that concert, de Vito realised she had reached the pinnacle of her career, and decided to retire in another three years. After informing the pope of her decision, Pius XII tried for an hour to dissuade her, saying she was far too young to retire so early, but to no avail. During the final years of her career, de Vito collaborated with Edwin Fischer, who was also nearing the end of his career. At their recording sessions for the Brahms sonatas Nos.1 and 3, he had required medical attention. The recording of Sonata No. 2 was assumed by Tito Aprea in 1956, after they successfully recorded Beethoven's Kreutzer and Frank's A major sonatas. Edwin Fischer died in 1960. De Vito retired in 1961, aged only 54, not just from concert appearances, but from playing the violin at all. She also decided not even to teach. Once while on holiday in Greece, she encountered Yehudi Menuhin on a beach, and she agreed to play some duets with him at his villa. Unfortunately, When they arrived at the villa, Menuhin realised he did not have a spare violin with him, so that sole opportunity to play once more never occurred. Fortunately, de Vito recorded Viotti's Duo in G with Menuhin in 1955. They also recorded Handel's Trio Sonata in G minor with John Shinebourne, 'cello and Raymond Leppard, harpsichord. Both recordings are to be found on Disc 41 of Menuhin ‚Äì the Great EMI Recordings. Two years earlier Menuhin, de Vito and Shinebourne along with harpsichordist George Malcolm, recorded Handel's Op.5/2 \\"Sonata for 2 Violins and Continuo in D\\" (Complete EMI Recordings, Korean issue from 2013). All of these works were recorded in EMI's Abbey Road Studio No.3. De Vito never played in the United States, although Arturo Toscanini and Charles Munch repeatedly invited her to do so. (She had played Bach for Toscanini in Paris in the 1930s, and he commented: \\"That's the way Bach should be played\\".Music: Europe's Finest. Time magazine, 21 September 1953]) However, she did appear in Australia (1957 & 1960), Argentina, India, Israel and Europe; and in the Soviet Union, where she was juror for the first Tchaikovsky Violin Competition, at the invitation of David Oistrakh. De Vito's repertoire was small; it excluded most of the popular violin concertos written after the 19th century (for example, those by Elgar, Sibelius, Bart√≥k, Berg, Bloch and Walton) ‚Äì the sole exception being the Pizzetti concerto. Her particular favourites were \\"the three Bs\\" ‚Äì Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Her major recordings were issued in 1990 as The Art of Gioconda de Vito. They include the Bach Double Violin Concerto with Yehudi Menuhin, conducted by Anthony Bernard. Private life In 1949, de Vito married David Bicknell, an executive with EMI Records, and although she lived in Britain from 1951, her English was always rudimentary and she often required a translator. Bicknell died in 1988, and Gioconda de Vito died in 1994, aged 87.

The book examines superheroes as a modern evolution of mythological archetypes and the more modern history, as well as the mystical influences on comics. Overview The book looks at the evolution of the superhero through the early Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths to the modern era. In particular Knowles highlights the significance of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel The Coming Race and its concept of the Vril-ya, a super human race occupying the hollow earth. This was adopted and adapted by Theosophy into their concept of Ascended Masters which when mixed with Friedrich Nietzsche's √úbermensch, became the template for the early superheroes. It then goes on to examine the influences of the pulp magazines on the development of what we would come to view as superheroes, looking at specific examples like The Shadow and Doc Savage The book breaks down superheroes into four main archetypes *Magic Men - the Wizard figure, from Mandrake the Magician and Doctor Occult through Doctor Strange to John Constantine but also including a lot of early superheroes whose Golden Age origins were magical, like Captain Marvel and Green Lantern.New Book Reveals Secret History of Comic Heroes, Comic Book Resources, November 23, 2007 *Messiahs - the \\"noble self-sacrificing hero who acts to save others out of a sense of altruism\\"Knowles page 119 with main example being one of the first: Superman; but it also includes Spider-Man and Captain America. *Amazons - the female counterpart, like Wonder Woman. *Golems - the antiheroes who either \\"act out of need for vengeance\\" (Batman) or \\"are berserkers, whose rage causes them to kill indiscriminately\\" (Punisher or Wolverine).Knowles page 145 It also examines the religious, mystical and occult influences on comics writers like Jack Kirby, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison.

Lee by noted American sculptor Alexander Doyle. It was removed (intact) by official order and moved to an unknown location on May 19, 2017. Any future display is uncertain. The monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.. Listing includes 3 photographs, map, and details of site's historic significance as exemplar of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, as conveyed in NRHP nomination It was included by New Orleans magazine in June 2011 as one of the city's \\"11 important statues\\". History Robert E. Lee Monument, close up Efforts to raise funds to build the statue began after Lee's death in 1870 by the Robert E. Lee Monument Association, which by 1876 had raised the $36,400 needed. The association's president was Louisiana Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Fenner.Charles Erasmus Fenner (1834-1911) in the Louisiana Historical Association's Dictionary of Louisiana Biography, retrieved 20 April 2018. New York sculptor Alexander Doyle was hired to sculpt the brass statue, which was installed in 1884. The granite base and pedestal was designed and built by John Ray [Roy], architect; contract dated 1877, at a cost of $26,474. John Hagan, a builder, was contracted to \\"furnish and set\\" the column at a cost of $9,350. The monument was dedicated in 1884, at Tivoli Circle (since commonly called Lee Circle) on St. Charles Avenue. Dignitaries present at the dedication on February 22‚ÄîGeorge Washington's birthday‚Äîincluded former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, two daughters of General Lee, and Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard. The statue itself rises 16'6\\" tall, with an 8'4\\" base, standing on a 60' column with an interior staircase, according to a schematic released by the City of New Orleans on the day of the removal of the statue and its base, May 19, 2017. Schematic of site The Lee statue faced \\"north where, as local lore has it, he can always look in the direction of his military adversaries.\\" In January 1953, the statue of General Lee was lifted from atop the column for repairs to the monument's foundation. The statue was returned to its perch in January the following year. A racial confrontation occurred at the monument on January 19, 1972, the birthday of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, when Addison Roswell Thompson, a perennial segregationist candidate for governor of Louisiana and mayor of New Orleans, and his friend and mentor, Rene LaCoste (not to be confused with the French tennis player Ren√© Lacoste), clashed with a group of Black Panthers. Then eighty-nine years of age and a former opera performer in New York City, LaCoste was described as \\"dapper in seersucker slacks and navy sports jacket\\" and with a \\"white mustache and goatee\\" resembling Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken. LaCoste and Thompson dressed in Klan robes for the occasion and placed a Confederate flag at the monument. The Black Panthers began throwing bricks at the pair, but police arrived in time to prevent serious injury. At the time of the Thompson/LaCoste confrontation, David Duke, then an active Klansman who served from 1989 to 1992 in the Louisiana House of Representatives, had been among those jailed in New Orleans for \\"inciting to riot\\". Removal of the monument On June 24, 2015, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu acknowledged the impact of the June 2015 Charleston church shooting, but credited a 2014 conversation with New Orleans jazz ambassador Wynton Marsalis for his decision to call for the removal of the Lee statue and renaming of Lee Circle and other city memorials dedicated to Confederate slaveholders. As part of a sixty-day period for public input, two city commissions called for the removal of four monuments associated with the Confederacy: the Lee statue, statues of Jefferson Davis and P.G.T. Beauregard, and an obelisk commemorating the Battle of Liberty Place. Governor Bobby Jindal opposed the removals. On December 15, 2015, Wynton Marsalis explained his reasons for advocating removal in The Times-Picayune: \\"When one surveys the accomplishments of our local heroes across time from Iberville and Bienville, to Andrew Jackson, from Mahalia Jackson, to Anne Rice and Fats Domino, from Wendell Pierce, to John Besh and Jonathan Batiste, what did Robert E. Lee do to merit his distinguished position? He fought for the enslavement of a people against our national army fighting for their freedom; killed more Americans than any opposing general in history; made no attempt to defend or protect this city; and even more absurdly, he never even set foot in Louisiana. In the heart of the most progressive and creative cultural city in America, why should we continue to commemorate this legacy?\\" Contrary to assertions that Robert E. Lee never set foot in New Orleans, he visited or passed through the city in 1846, 1848, 1860 and 1861, while serving in the United States Army.Encyclopediavirginia.orgThomas, Emory M. (1997) Robert E. Lee: A Biography. New York: W. W. Norton & Co. p. 426. While in New Orleans, Lee was quartered at the military post of Jackson Barracks.Geauxguardmuseums.com On December 17, 2015, the New Orleans City Council voted to relocate four statues from public display, among them the statue of Robert E. Lee located in Lee Circle. Four organizations immediately filed a lawsuit Plaintiffs: Monumental Task Committee, Inc., Louisiana Landmarks Society, Foundation for Historical Louisiana, Inc., and Beauregard Camp, No. 130, Inc. in federal court the day of the decision and the city administration agreed that no monument removals would take place before a court hearing scheduled for January 14, 2016. In January 2016, David Mahler, a contractor who had been hired by the City of New Orleans to remove the four statues including the statue of Robert E. Lee located in Lee Circle backed out of his contract with the city after he, his family, and employees began receiving death threats. According to authorities in Baton Rouge, early on the morning of January 19, 2016 the Fire Department found a 2014 Lamborghini Huracan ablaze in a parking lot behind David Mahler's company, H&O; Investments, LLC. The car, belonging to Mahler and valued at $200,000, was completely destroyed. On March 4, 2016, State Senator Beth Mizell, of Franklinton in Washington Parish, filed a bill in the Legislature seeking to block local governments in Louisiana from removing Confederate monuments and other commemorative statues without State permission. The Mizell bill was unexpectedly assigned by Senate President John Alario, a Republican from Westwego in Jefferson Parish, to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, rather than to the Senate Education Committee. This doomed the bill; five of the nine members of the Governmental Affairs Committee are African-American Democrats and it is chaired by Karen Carter Peterson of New Orleans. The Education Committee is composed of six Republicans and two Democrats. 2016‚Äì17 legal developments On March 25, 2016 a three-judge panel of the United States 5th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously issued an injunction for that suit brought in federal district court by the Monumental Task Committee and other groups opposed to the removal of the Robert E. Lee Monument, and monuments to Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard prohibiting the City of New Orleans from proceeding forward with removal of the three monuments. The Court of Appeals set a hearing date of September 28, 2016 for oral argument for whether its injunction should be maintained pending a final judgment on the merits of the district court suit. The decision of the Court of Appeals superseded that ruling of United States District Court Judge Carl Barbier rendered January 26, 2016 denying the motion of the plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction against the City of New Orleans until a final judgment on their district court suit.Monumental Task Committiee, Inc. v. Foxx, 157 F.Supp.3d 573 (E.D.La., 2016) On April 6, 2016 Senate Bill 276 by State Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton to block local governments in Louisiana from removing Confederate monuments and other commemorative statues without State permission was rejected by the Governmental Affairs Committee on a 5‚Äì4 racial and party line vote. On August 14, 2016, pro-monuments House Bill 944 by Rep. Thomas Carmody, R-Shreveport, to create a state board with the power to grant or deny proposals to remove or relocate a statue, monument, memorial or plaque that has been on public property for more than 30 years died in the Municipal Affairs Committee after a 7‚Äì7 tie vote. On March 6, 2017, following oral argument on September 28, 2017 for whether its injunction should be maintained pending a final judgment of the district court on the merits of the suit brought by the Monumental Task Committee and other groups opposed to the removal of the Robert E. Lee Monument, and monuments to Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, the three-judge panel of the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously held the City of New Orleans should be enjoined no further and could proceed forward with the removal of the three Confederate monuments. In support of its ruling, the Court of Appeals panel held, \\"we have exhaustively reviewed the record and can find no evidence in the record suggesting that any party other than the City has ownership\\" and the plaintiffs failed to show any irreparable harm would occur to the monuments if the City of New Orleans were to remove them, even assuming such evidence would constitute a harm to the groups bringing the suit.Monumental Task Committiee, Inc. v. Chao, No. 16-30107. (5th Cir., 2017) Dismantling Spectators watching the Lee statue lifted from its column On May 18, 2017, the City of New Orleans announced the statue of General Robert E. Lee would be removed the following day.http://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_cc3b196e-3c28-11e7-97aa- ef4297dddb6a.html On May 19, 2017 just after 6 p.m. following an all day effort by work crews, the statue of Lee was finally detached and then removed and lowered by crane from its column pedestal.Nola.comThe Advocate While crews were working on removing the statue, New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu gave a speech at Gallier Hall discussing the historical context of the Lee and other monuments, and the reasons for and meaning of their removal. The removal prompted Mississippi lawmaker Karl Oliver to post on Facebook that those supporting the take-down of the Confederate monuments \\"should be LYNCHED\\".

Students enrolled in this program study one semester each at three business schools - School of Management of Fudan University, Korea University Business School of Korea University and NUS Business School of National University of Singapore. The name of the program, S¬≥, is derived from the first letter of the three cities where the business schools are located: Shanghai, Seoul and Singapore. It is claimed that presently, the program is the only one of its type in the world. Background S¬≥ Asia MBA - partner business schools The program was formally launched on the 28 February, 2008 at Korea University Business School. However, the idea had originally germinated when officials from the three universities met at a centennial celebration of the three universities. The tri-university colloquium between Fudan, KU and NUS first began in 2005. The universities founded the S¬≥ University Alliance (S¬≥UA) and sealed it with the Seoul Declaration for Collaboration at the Tri-University Colloquium in Seoul on 19 May, 2006. Overview The program consists of three semesters conducted across three leading Asian business schools: School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Korea University Business School, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea; and NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, Singapore. The three business schools are, respectively, #89, #86 and #36 on the 2013 list of world's top 100 business schools by the Financial Times. Fudan University (1st Semester - September to December) The program starts at School of Management, Fudan University (Shanghai) with a mandatory three-day orientation program. The orientation is a collaborative exercise which teaches team spirit, knowledge sharing, strategic decision making and cultural values to the participants. Upon the completion of the orientation program, students are awarded a certificate. The first semester curriculum is articulate and provides an understanding of the major management sciences subjects. First semester courses (listed alphabetically): Asian Business Insights I (Field Trip); Basic Chinese (non-credit, optional); Business in China; Data, Models, and Decisions (DMD); Financial Accounting (FA); Managerial Communication (MC); Managerial Economics (ME); Organizational Behavior (OB); Politics (mandatory for Chinese nationals). In addition, there is an optional, certificate course on banking named \\"Citi-Fudan University Banking Course\\", delivered by senior executives of Citi. The Business in China course is divided into four equal parts, with each part delivered by a different professor. Each part focuses on a different dimension of doing business inside China. =Accommodation= Foreign students may get a room booked in Fudan's International Student Dormitory or in the Tonghe International Student Village, which is a private dormitory with hotel-like services. A majority of foreign students prefer staying at Tonghe. Korea University (2nd Semester - February to June) The second semester starts during peak winter at Seoul. After the initial registration and an orientation trip, students are given a break of about a week to explore the city and to settle down. This semester is divided into two modules (sub-semesters) with Asian Business Insights II (Field Trip) sandwiched between the two modules. The primary teaching method used during this semester for all courses is the case method. In addition to the regular classes, there are some special guest lectures held jointly with the Global MBA class of KUBS. Second semester courses (listed alphabetically): Asian Business Insights II (Field Trip); Basic Korean or Business English (non-credit, optional); Business Ethics in Asian Companies; Business in Korea and Japan; Corporate Finance; Management Information Systems (MIS); Managerial Accounting; Marketing Management; Operations and Process Management (OPM). National University of Singapore (3rd Semester - August to December) The third semester at NUS Business School starts with several activities - a multi-day Orientation and a two-day team-building session at Outward Bound Singapore, as well as the NUS Orientation Graduation Dinner. In this semester students are able to select elective courses, allowing them to specialize (although both degrees given under S¬≥ Asia MBA are General Management degrees). In addition to the core courses, students can typically choose three electives (although it is also possible to choose four electives). It is at NUS Business School that the S¬≥ Asia MBA class mingles with the NUS MBA cohort, exchange students from foreign schools, and also the part-time MBA students. In addition, students can also take up cross-faculty courses, allowing them to, for example, work with engineering students. Third semester courses (listed alphabetically): Advanced Business English (mandatory for Fudan students and optional for KU/NUS students); Asia Pacific Business; Asian Business Insights III (Field Trip); Corporate Strategy; Elective 1; Elective 2; Elective 3 (it is possible to choose four electives by taking up two half-modules). Double Degree and a Certificate Map of cities and schools in S¬≥ Asia MBA Upon the successful completion of the program, students are awarded two MBA degrees: a degree from a student's \\"home university\\" and a degree from a second university of choice. Candidates are awarded S¬≥ Asia MBA program certificate signed by the three deans from FDSM, KUBS and NUS Business School. For students with their home university as FDSM and KUBS, GMAT is a requirement if a student seeks NUS for his/her second degree. For students with KUBS or NUS as the home university, a second degree from Fudan requires defending a thesis (in the 4th semester at Fudan). For FDSM or NUS students, there is no special requirement to have a second degree from KUBS.

History  The ICO was established in 1857 in Brussels when 150 ophthalmologists from 24 countries met in the first International Congress of Ophthalmology (now the World Ophthalmology Congress - WOC). The Advisory Board (executive body) was created in 1927 in Scheveningen, Holland. Member societies were added (International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies) in 1933 in Madrid, Spain. Prior to July 2008, International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies (IFOS) was the official name of the organization, with the ICO serving as the executive body. But over the years the \\"ICO\\" became better known than IFOS, leading to considerable confusion and a proposal to adopt a single name.

It took place in the small Egyptian naval anchorage of Marsa Talamat, in the central sector of the Gulf of Suez. Two Israeli Dabur class patrol boats were on a routine patrol mission when the Egyptian Army launched a surprise attack into Israeli occupied Sinai. When it became evident that a war had started, the Israeli boats were reassigned to the mission of destroying Egyptian commando boats in order to interrupt Egyptian commando operations in the Gulf of Suez. The Israeli boats located two Egyptian commando boats which were about to depart Marsa Talamat. The Israeli boats attacked, and continued their attack even when both Daburs accidentally ran aground. The Israeli boats managed to retreat after inflicting considerable damage on the Egyptian commandos. For their actions in the battle, three Israeli crewmen were later awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service. The battle was amongst several significant naval battles which dictated the course of the naval war. Prelude On the morning of October 6, a force of two Israeli Dabur class Fast Patrol Boats were anchored on buoys at Ras Sudar‚Äîthen a small Israeli naval anchorage in the northern sector of the Gulf of Suez ‚Äî part of a routine patrol mission in the Gulf. The Israeli boats, commanded by Navy Lt. Zvika Shahak, had left their base at Sharm al Sheikh a day before. According to Shahak, the intelligence briefing prior to the mission only included a general reference to Egyptian preparation for a possible war. At 14:10, soon after the Egyptian Army launched its surprise attack (code-named Operation Badr), the Daburs were ordered to leave the anchorage and to patrol along the coast towards the Israeli oil installations at Abu-Rodeis. Once at sea, the Daburs were able to observe significant traffic of Egyptian helicopters headed towards Sinai. At 15:22 the Daburs were ordered to open fire at any Egyptian helicopters or boats, but were unable to engage any of them. The Israeli boats continued their patrol with no special events until 22:00 when they were ordered to turn south, towards Ras Zafranah, a naval anchorage used by the Egyptian Navy. Their mission was to seek, engage and destroy any enemy boats they could find. The boats arrived at Ras Zafranah anchorage, and found it empty. By that time The Daburs lost communications with their home-base at Sharm, which ‚Äî as they later learned ‚Äî had been attacked by Egyptian Raduga KSR-2 cruise missiles. Even though he was not ordered to do so, Shahak decided to inspect Marsa Talamat, an anchorage further south from Ras Zafranah. Battle The two Israeli Daburs arrived at Marsa Talamat after 01:00 am on the night of October 6‚Äì7. Shahak maneuvered his vessel into the anchorage, while ordering the other to stay outside for cover. Upon entry, Shahak discovered a Bertram class patrol boat and two Zodiacs filled with Egyptian naval commandos in their battle gear and about to depart. The Dabur opened fire first and the Zodiacs sunk immediately. The Dabur then maneuvered to attack the Bertram, and while doing so ran aground about 20 meters (about 65 feet) from the coastline. Both engines stopped. As it ran aground, the Dabur came under heavy gun, rocket and light-arm fire, including from 14.5mm Coastal Guns. Shahak had his men returning fire and at the same time called the second Dabur for support. As the second boat entered the anchorage, it too ran aground. The boats remained aground for over two hours under heavy enemy fire, before they were able to extricate themselves. During the fight the Bertram was severely damaged but did not sink. The Israelis were only able to sink it by firing a 25 mm flare gun, which ignited the Bertram, causing it to explode. Once back afloat, the Israeli boats retreated and made their way to Abu-Zaneima where they were met ‚Äî at 04:22 ‚Äî by an Israeli Air Force Helicopter which evacuated the wounded. Altogether, 1 Israeli crewman was killed and 7 wounded. The Egyptians lost the Bertram and the two Zodiacs, all loaded with naval commandos about to depart on a mission. Aftermath and significance According to Rabinovich the outcome of the Marsa Talamat battle \\"derailed\\" the Egyptian \\"master plan\\" for southern Sinai.Rabinovich, p. 250 Apparently, the Egyptian forces which were destroyed at Marsa Talamat were intended to reinforce and resupply forces which landed in Sinai the day before. Almog mentions the battle as one of several which enabled Israel to maintain control of the Gulf of Suez throughout the war. According to Almog: > \\"The Israeli Navy's combat initiatives, combined with the support of ground > and air forces, gave Israel full control over the Gulf of Suez and led > eventually to the following far-reaching results: * Dozens of Egyptian- > mobilized fishing boats loaded with troops, ammunition, and supplies, ready > to invade the Israeli side of the Gulf of Suez and support the helicopter- > borne beachhead, were either destroyed or confined to their anchorages. * > Commando troops of the Egyptian beachhead were either killed or captured. > This force, landed by helicopter along the Sinai shores, was cut off from > its support bases in the Egyptian anchorages of the Gulf of Suez and in > mainland Egypt. * Israel's control of the Gulf of Suez made possible the > continued deployment of a surface-to-air missile battery close to the > Israeli Ras-Sudr naval base, near the southern end of the Suez Canal. This > maneuver deprived the Egyptian Third Field Army of air support and prevented > it from moving southward to occupy the southern Sinai. * The Israeli Navy > assisted in tightening the blockade around the besieged Egyptian Third Field > Army from the southern flank. This flank bordered on the northern part of > the Gulf of Suez, completing the encirclement.\\" Following the battle, three Israeli crewmen were awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service: Zvi Shahak, who commanded the operation; 2nd Lt. Ami Segev, an officer on Shahak's Dabur who kept fighting even after being severely wounded; and Staff-Sergeant Shalom Nachmani, Shahak's Dabur chief mechanic. Able to patch the boat's damaged engines and restart them, Nachmani was in fact the one responsible for the boat's recovery after it ran aground. A fourth member of the crew, 2nd Lt. Nimrod Erez, who had fired the flare gun at the Bertram, was awarded the Chief Of Staff Citation.

It is directed by Ching-chih Chen, Professor Emeritus of Simmons College, Boston, Massachusetts and supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s International Digital Library Program (IDLP). The goal of GMNet is to provide a global collaborative network that provides universal access to educational resources to a worldwide audience. GMNet provides multilingual and multimedia content and retrieval, as well as links directly to major resources, such as OCLC, Internet Archive, Million Book Project, and Google. History Global Memory Net superseded Chinese Memory Net (CMNet) , which was founded in 2001 as a NSF/IDLP project. It was intended to make Chinese cultural and heritage resources globally accessible in a multimedia format. \\"The experiences and knowledge gained from [CMNet] made me realize the need to rethink the model for information dissemination and use,\\" wrote Chen in 2001.Chen, Ching-chih. 2001. Chinese Memory Net (CMNet): A model for collaborative global digital library development, In: Global Digital Library Development in the New Millennium: Fertile Ground for Distributed Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration. Beijing, China: Tsinghua University Press. pp. 21‚Äì32. CMNet later expanded to represent global collections and officially became Global Memory Net in 2003. Collections Reflecting GMNet's origins in CMNet and Prof. Chen's earlier PROJECT EMPEROR-I, an interactive multimedia project , the strongest portion of the collection's content is from China and Asia. This collection includes over 8000 images and featured videos of this World Heritage Site and the original discovery and excavation of the Emperor's terracotta army. Additional to the Asian collections are materials from around the world. A number of comprehensive collections are included, covering specific sites, cultures, and other overarching themes from content collaborators, including the UNESCO's Memory of the World, Asia Division of Library of Congress, national libraries, academic institutions, and some private groups. These collections feature images of geographical locations and historical sites, historical manuscripts, maps, art, indigenous crafts, weapons, pottery and musical instruments. Every image is accompanied by metadata information. Images of musical instruments are linked with the audio and video files, and with notations. Metadata is recorded in multiple languages. In general, English is provided and is often also available in the local language of the object's country of origin. A recent ongoing project is the multilingual and multimedia documentation of all the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, known as World Heritage Memory Net. Collections in GMNet are broken up into the following categories to help users browse the extensive content: * Antique Maps * Arts, Paintings, Poetry * Cathedrals, Churches, Shrines, Temples * Ethnic Groups * Historical Cities * Musical Instruments * National Libraries * National Memories * Old Civilizations and Culture * Palaces- Ancient and Current * Selected Museums * UNESCO Memory of the World * UNESCO World Heritage Sites In addition, GMNet also includes instant access to over 2530 digital collections from over 80 countries in the world in its World Digital Collections. Usage Search Methods When one enters GMNet, all collections can be searched using an open search box, which allows traditional search by metadata fields (such as title, date, location, keyword, source, etc.) in multiple languages. Advanced Search with additional Boolean Operators is available for both Collections and images by language and by multiple fields. Information in GMNet is retrieved not only by the traditional way of searching by collection listings, country, or timeline, but especially by enhanced search methods including freely browsing, randomly looking for images of interest, finding similar images, zooming for details, and obtaining appropriate annotations. GMNet's search capabilities include: * Content-based image retrieval (CBIR): This is one of the key features of Global Memory Net. :A user can gain familiarity with an unknown collection through CBIR using Random and Browse image searches, which allow users to browse the collections without requiring knowledge of the language used to describe the records. Randomizing allows users to view a randomized overview of thumbnail images for a collection; users can then follow their visual or contextual interests and narrow their focus if they wish by using the Similar, Larger, and Info functions. Similar retrieves images of the same color and shape, and uses the CBIR developed by Prof. James Z. Wang at Penn State University, but modified in-house . Users can enlarge the thumbnail images (magnification varies with resolution) and also obtain additional descriptive information, including multilingual, multimedia and links where available. * Traditional Search: :When one has some knowledge of a given collection or of specific information that they are seeking within that collection, a search box allows traditional search by metadata fields (such as title, date, location, keyword, source, etc.) in multiple languages. * Geographical Search: :Collections are also accessible through a navigation bar link to a listing by country, leading to multiple browsable images and information. * Temporal Search: :All Collections are listed on a sliding timeline which links to individual Collection pages with information and browsable images. Users can scroll through the centuries viewing all relevant Sites Collections related to the time period of interest. Linked Data GMNet links to outside data sources to provide more additional information resources to the user. These resources include OCLC, Internet Archive, Million Books, Google Scholar and Google Books, wikipedia, and Flickr. User‚Äôs Projects Registered users may create up to 3 projects and save images in a durable portfolio within GMNet. As users search through the collections they can save and add notes and metadata to individual objects.

Plot Corporate real estate tycoon Hamilton Lux (Armand Assante) sets his sights on developing the quaint seaside town of Full Moon Bay, California into a prime getaway for the wealthy, but runs into some unexpected problems. Lifelong fisherman Daniel Wilder (John Schneider) and wife Brooke (Daryl Hannah) own property exactly where Lux wants to build high-priced condos, and isn't planning to sell. Lux secretly laces the local waters with a toxin deadly to marine life, decimating the fishing industry in an attempt to starve Daniel out. Alas, the chemical react differently on the area's sharks, drastically increasing their aggressive tendencies and transforming them into engines of pure destruction moving in coordinated swarms. Without fish to feed on, shark attacks on humans rapidly increase. Lux uses media contacts to paint the attacks as random incidents. Daniel, his marine biologist brother and a concerned E.P.A. agent must expose Lux's plan and rid the area of the chemically-altered sharks before the town's entire population is devoured by hungry sharks.

History Developed with Swedish assistance (today Dynamit Nobel AG). The EFP disc was originally manufactured in Sweden then license produced in Yugoslavia. It may bear resemblance to the AT2 mine. Description The mine is intended for incapacitating and demolition of enemy armoured and other combat and transport vehicles. It has a destructive and penetrating effect. The activation force by a bar is 13‚Äì17 N (1.3‚Äì1.7 kgf; 2‚Äì4 lbf) and by pressure 1500‚Äì3500 N (150‚Äì350 kgf; 330‚Äì780 lbf). Temperature range: ‚àí25 ¬∞C to +50 ¬∞C (‚Äì10 ¬∞F to +90 ¬∞F). Armed with the pressure lever type mechanical fuze which makes a unit with the mine. The firing pin of the fuze is locked and the explosive chain interrupted, securing safety in storage, transportation and laying. The safety is for 1 or 4 minutes. The mine is laid either manually, by means of minelayer or from helicopter. Arming is automatically done in the ditch. Laid in dry or swampy ground. Airtight. Resistant to the action of increased air pressure. General information Size: √ò = 290√ó132 mm (11¬Ω√ó5¬º in). Capable for any type of transportation. Mass of the mine is 7.2 kg. Explosive charge of cast TNT, mass 5.1 kg with tetryl detonator. The mine penetrates an armour to 40 mm at a distance to 80 cm and may act sidewise from a distance of 45 m. Mine laying The mine may be laid manually, mechanically and from helicopters. In manual laying. a clod is cut, larger by one half than the mine diameter and a well is dug so that the clod of 2‚Äì3 cm is protruding by 2 cm above the ground. The mine is laid in the well, the safety element is taken off, safety is set at 1 or 4 minutes the starter is pressed (the fuze bar is fitted) and the mine camouflaged. The mine is safe for 6 months even under very unfavourable conditions. Fuze UTMRP-6 The fuze is mechanical of pressure-lever type, permanently fitted in the mine. It has a clockwork safety, set at 1 or 4 minutes. The basic position is 1 minute. The fuze is activated by a pressure force of 1500 N (330 lbf) or more. The mine may be armed with a supplementary fuze too and may be electrically activated in controlled firing. The fuze may be activated also by action of a bar which Is fitted on the fuze after laying of the mine, with a force of 13‚Äì17 N (2‚Äì4 lbf). The fuze has an ejection charge of black powder which breaks the weakened part of the mine body, ejecting the top part with tuze, removing the clod and clearing the way to the penetrating disc to obtain a higher penetration. Mine clearing The camouflaging layer is removed, the protective plug is unscrewed, the wrench is fitted, interrupting the explosive train and the fuze is set in safe position; the safety element is put on (the haze bar is removed) and the mine is taken out from well. Packing Four mines are packed per case: 330√ó650√ó330 mm, mass 43 kg (95 lb). Storage capacity -15 years.Casing manufacturer Operators SFRY Yugoslavia : passed on to successor states Not exported abroad.

The laboratory grew out of the World War II era Dayton Project (a site within the Manhattan Project) where the neutron generating triggers for the first plutonium bombs were developed. Post-war construction of a permanent site for Dayton Project activities began in 1947. The lab was originally known as the Dayton Engineer Works. The lab began operations in 1948 and was managed by Monsanto. Mound produced detonators, cable assemblies, timers, firing sets, and other equipment. In 1954, Mound began working with tritium. The lab disassembled bomb components, recovering the tritium within and sending it for repurification at Savannah River Site. Mound supplied enriched non-radioactive isotopes. The lab also produced plutonium-238-powered thermoelectric heat sources called SNAP or Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power for the U.S. space program. Mound was declared a Superfund site and was put on the National Priorities list in 1989. In a decision was made to close the plant by 2006. Cleanup of the site began in 1995. Work with tritium ended in 1997. Cleanup of the site finished in 2010.http://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0504935&msspp;=med References Sources * Thomas B. Cochran, William M.

Mathematically they are similar to the hypercube graphs, but with a Fibonacci number of vertices. Fibonacci cubes were first explicitly defined in in the context of interconnection topologies for connecting parallel or distributed systems. They have also been applied in chemical graph theory. The Fibonacci cube may be defined in terms of Fibonacci codes and Hamming distance, independent sets of vertices in path graphs, or via distributive lattices. Definition Like the hypercube graph, the vertices of the Fibonacci cube of order n may be labeled with bitstrings of length n, in such a way that two vertices are adjacent whenever their labels differ in a single bit. However, in a Fibonacci cube, the only labels that are allowed are bitstrings with no two consecutive 1 bits. There are Fn + 2 labels possible, where Fn denotes the nth Fibonacci number, and therefore there are Fn + 2 vertices in the Fibonacci cube of order n. Fibonacci cubes (drawn in red) as subgraphs of hypercubes The nodes of such a network may be assigned consecutive integers from 0 to Fn + 2 ‚àí 1; the bitstrings corresponding to these numbers are given by their Zeckendorf representations., pp. 3‚Äì4. The Fibonacci cube of order 6 Algebraic structure The Fibonacci cube of order n is the simplex graph of the complement graph of an n-vertex path graph., p.3. That is, each vertex in the Fibonacci cube represents a clique in the path complement graph, or equivalently an independent set in the path itself; two Fibonacci cube vertices are adjacent if the cliques or independent sets that they represent differ by the addition or removal of a single element. Therefore, like other simplex graphs, Fibonacci cubes are median graphs and more generally partial cubes.; , Theorem 5.1, p.10. The median of any three vertices in a Fibonacci cube may be found by computing the bitwise majority function of the three labels; if each of the three labels has no two consecutive 1 bits, the same is true of their majority. The Fibonacci cube is also the graph of a distributive lattice that may be obtained via Birkhoff's representation theorem from a zigzag poset, a partially ordered set defined by an alternating sequence of order relations a < b > c < d > e < f > ... calls the fact that this lattice has a Fibonacci number of elements a ‚Äúwell known fact,‚Äù while asks for a description of it in an exercise. See also , , and . There is also an alternative graph-theoretic description of the same lattice: the independent sets of any bipartite graph may be given a partial order in which one independent set is less than another if they differ by removing elements from one side of the bipartition and adding elements to the other side of the bipartition; with this order, the independent sets form a distributive lattice,. and applying this construction to a path graph results in the lattice associated with the Fibonacci cube. Properties and algorithms The Fibonacci cube of order n may be partitioned into a Fibonacci cube of order n ‚àí 1 (the nodes with labels beginning with a 0 bit) and a Fibonacci cube of order n ‚àí 2 (the nodes with labels beginning with a 1 bit)., pp. 4‚Äì5. Every Fibonacci cube has a Hamiltonian path. More specifically, there exists a path that obeys the partition described above: it visits the nodes with first bit 0 and the nodes with first bit 1 in two contiguous subsequences. Within these two subsequences, the path can be constructed recursively by the same rule, linking the two subsequences at the ends of the subsequences at which the second bit is 0. Thus, e.g., in the Fibonacci cube of order 4, the sequence constructed in this way is (0100-0101-0001-0000-0010)-(1010-1000-1001), where the parentheses demark the subsequences within the two subgraphs of the partition. Fibonacci cubes with an even number of nodes greater than two have a Hamiltonian cycle.. investigate the radius and independence number of Fibonacci cubes. Because these graphs are bipartite and have Hamiltonian paths, their maximum independent sets have a number of vertices that is equal to half of the number of vertices in the whole graph, rounded up to the nearest integer., p.6. The diameter of a Fibonacci cube of order n is n, and its radius is n/2 (again, rounded up to the nearest integer)., p.9. showed that it is possible to test whether a graph is a Fibonacci cube in time near- linear in its size. Applications and suggested using Fibonacci cubes as a network topology in parallel computing. As a communications network, the Fibonacci cube has beneficial properties similar to those of the hypercube: the number of incident edges per vertex is at most n/2 and the diameter of the network is at most n, both proportional to the logarithm of the number of vertices, and the ability of the network to be partitioned into smaller networks of the same type allows it to be split among multiple parallel computation tasks. Fibonacci cubes also support efficient protocols for routing and broadcasting in distributed computations.; . apply Fibonacci cubes in chemical graph theory as a description of the family of perfect matchings of certain molecular graphs. For a molecular structure described by a planar graph G, the resonance graph or (Z-transformation graph) of G is a graph whose vertices describe perfect matchings of G and whose edges connect pairs of perfect matchings whose symmetric difference is an interior face of G. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be described as subgraphs of a hexagonal tiling of the plane, and the resonance graph describes possible double-bond structures of these molecules. As show, hydrocarbons formed by chains of hexagons, linked edge-to-edge with no three adjacent hexagons in a line, have resonance graphs that are exactly the Fibonacci graphs. More generally described the class of planar bipartite graphs that have Fibonacci cubes as their resonance graphs. Related graphs Generalized Fibonacci cubes were presented by based on the k-th order Fibonacci numbers, which were later further extended to a larger class of networks called the Linear Recursive Networks by based on more general forms of linear recursions. modified the second order Fibonacci cubes based on different initial conditions. Another related graph is the Lucas cube, a graph with a Lucas number of vertices defined from the Fibonacci cube by forbidding a 1 bit in both the first and last positions of each bitstring; investigated the coloring properties of both Fibonacci cubes and Lucas cubes.

He was awarded the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions at the Battle of Lewis's Farm. Biography Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Pearson studied law at Meadville College and Jefferson College. He was admitted to the Allegheny County bar on January 14, 1862, but worked in the profession for only a few months before leaving to join the army. Alfred Pearson He enlisted in the 155th Pennsylvania Infantry on April 2, 1862, and was commissioned a captain in Company A later that year, on August 23. Over the next few years he took part in all of his regiment's operations and received a series of promotions: to major on December 31, 1862, to lieutenant colonel on July 22, 1863, and to colonel on August 31, 1863. On December 14, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Pearson for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from September 30, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 754 On March 29, 1865, in the last weeks of the war, Pearson participated in the Battle of Lewis's Farm in Virginia. When a Union brigade was pushed back by intense Confederate fire, Pearson rallied his regiment and led an attack which successfully regained the lost ground. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on September 17, 1897. In the last months of his military service he commanded the 3rd Brigade and later the 1st Brigade of 1st Division, V Corps. He was mustered out of the Army on June 2, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Pearson for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers to rank from May 1, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 714 After the war Pearson returned to Pittsburgh and resumed the practice of law. He was elected Allegheny County's district attorney in October 1868 and served in that post until health problems forced him to retire from the legal profession. He later worked as a county gas inspector. Pearson was appointed a major general in the Pennsylvania National Guard in 1870 and placed in command of the 6th Division. He served in that capacity during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, in which dozens of rioters were killed when his troops opened fire. Pearson was active in veterans' affairs and was for many years a manager of the National Soldiers' Home. He was one of the organizers of the Grand Army of the Republic and was commander of the group's Department of Pennsylvania. He helped organize another veterans' group, the Union Veteran Legion, and was its first national commander. He was also a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion and the Medal of Honor Legion. Pearson married Elizabeth Harwood Stewart and had a son, Alfred Laurence Pearson, who went on to become a successful businessman. He died on January 6, 1903, at age 64 and was buried at Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. Medal of Honor citation Pearson's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > Seeing a brigade forced back by the enemy, he seized his regimental color, > called on his men to follow him, and advanced upon the enemy under a severe > fire. The whole brigade took up the advance, the lost ground was regained, > and the enemy was repulsed.

The house of the family was located miles from anywhere in between unspoiled countryside. Otto Kleinschmidt was already as a young boy highly interested in nature and the world of the birds. Besides that it was kind of a family tradition to research and collect. Already at the age of 8 Otto prepared his first taxidermied birds. He introduced a typological species concept into German ornithology. His Formenkreis theory influenced the early ideas of Erwin Stresemann. Others have considered him one of the first biogeographers. His position was that similar \\"forms\\" (species) found in geographically distant regions could be accounted for by \\"formation rings\\" ‚Äì with a fixed set of characters.

Clemmons received the Terry Haskins Award again in 2012 for his work on issues important to the Republican Party Platform as well as for his work on the redistricting process. Clemmons has also taken the lead in South Carolina on pro-Israel issues. From 2004 until 2008, Clemmons served as Secretary-Treasurer of the S.C. House Republican Caucus. He was term-limited from seeking additional years in the position. He has also been a staunch voice in the S.C. General Assembly in favor of extending Interstate 73 to Myrtle Beach. He served as Chairman for the South Carolina I-73 Association from 2003 to 2007 and currently serves as Board Chairman of the National I-73/I-74/I-75 Association.About Us, National I-73/I-74/I-75 Corridor Association Rep. Clemmons has served as Chairman for the House Rules Committee since 2011. He is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, in which he served as 2nd Vice Chairman from 2004 to 2006. Among other pieces of legislation, Clemmons was the sponsor of the Rider Safety Act which emphasizes the responsibility of individuals to act responsibly on amusement park rides. In April 2014, Clemmons introduced a bill to the House of Representatives that could pave the way for a large brewing company to construct a new brewery location in Myrtle Beach. Current legislation limits the amount barrels a beer produced per year to 2,000 to brewpubs that wish to produce beer and sell it in the same location. The bill, if passed, would allow a brewpub in South Carolina to produce up to 500,000 barrels of beer a year and still sell the beer at the brewing site.The Sun News: Brewpub bill that would allow for Stone Brewing Co. introduced in SC House Clemmons received the following recognitions for his legislative and community service: South Carolina Hero, 2008, by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP); Legislator of the Year, 2006, by the South Carolina Association of Realtors; Legislator of the Year, 2005, by the Association of Drug Stores; Special Legislative Commendation, 2004, by the South Carolina Silver Haired Legislature; and Distinguished Alumnus of the Year, 2004, by Coastal Carolina University. Clemmons entered the national spotlight during a case challenging whether a South Carolina Voter ID law he worked on while in the House of Representatives violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act. During testimony in the proceeding, Clemmons stated that he responded to an e-mail from a man named Ed Koziol saying, \\"Amen, Ed, thank you for your support.\\" A portion of the email from Kozoil stated that if the legislature offered a reward for identification cards, ‚Äúit would be like a swarm of bees going after a watermelon.‚Äù Views on Israel and the BDS movement Clemmons denies that Israel has a military occupation of the West Bank, and refers to such descriptions as ‚Äúthe lie of occupation,‚Äù writing \\"To suggest that the Jews are occupiers in a region that has been known as Judea for over 3000-plus years is no less ridiculous than to suggest that Arabs are occupiers in Arabia.\\" In 2011, Clemmons wrote a pro- Israel resolution drawing inspiration from Bible verses: > Whereas, Israel has been granted her lands under and through the oldest > recorded deed as reported in the Old Testament, a tome of scripture held > sacred and reverenced by Jew and Christian, alike, as the acts and words of > God; and Whereas, as the Grantor of said lands, God stated to the Jewish > people in the Old Testament; in Leviticus, Chapter 20, Verse 24: \\"Ye shall > inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that > floweth with milk and honey\\"; and Whereas, God has never rescinded his grant > of said lands; and ... Be it resolved by the House of Representatives: That > the members of the South Carolina House of Representatives, by this > resolution, commend the nation of Israel for its relations with the United > States of America and with the State of South Carolina. The resolution received positive response from both Democratic and Republican legislature members in South Carolina. Israeli lawmakers, who had heard about the South Carolina resolution, invited Clemmons to speak at the Knesset‚Äôs inaugural meeting of the caucus against antisemitism. In 2014, Clemmons led a group of South Carolina legislators to Israel on an economic development visit for marrying venture capital with new technologies.YONAH JEREMY BOB. HOW US STATES ARE COUNTERING THE BDS MOVEMENT AGAINST ISRAEL, Jerusalem Post, October 17, 2016. In 2015, in response to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, Clemmons sponsored an anti-BDS law which prohibited public entities from doing businesses with companies that boycotts Israel. The bill passed with strong bipartisan support. More controversially, in March, 2017 while speaking at a United Nations gathering opposed to the BDS campaign, Clemmons accused J Street, a pro-Israel PAC, of being anti-Semitic due to their positions on the West Bank and Gaza Strip (collectively, the State of Palestine). This charge was rejected by Jewish groups spanning the political spectrum right to left.

Due to his political activity, he was chased by the Axis forces, Greek state and National Liberation Front (Greece). For quite a few years before his death, he was the oldest survivor among the active participants of the great strike of 1936, in Thessaloniki. Biography He was born in 1908, in Fo√ßa, Ottoman Empire. In 1914, his family fled persecutions of Anatolian Greeks to Greece, and he was forced to earn his living as a street vendor of simits and later as a shoeshiner. In 1918-1919, aged 11, he participated in a workers' manifestation for the 1st of May, in the district of Evangelistria, Thessaloniki, for the first time. He had his first contact with supporters of Archeio-Marxism in 1924. He took part in every workers' struggle in Thessaloniki, as a shoemaker, having been elected committee member (1926‚Äì1927) and a secretary (1928‚Äì1929) of the Union of the Shoe-makers of Thessaloniki. Later, he got active through the union of the unemployed. In 1931, while on the frontline of a demonstration of the unemployed, in Syntrivani Square in Thessaloniki, he was attacked by a group of policemen, led by the nephew of the Head of the Police; the former shot him in the cheek and the bullet cut his tongue. He didn't lose his ability to speak, thanks to sub-consequent surgeries.\\"ŒëŒΩœÑŒØŒø, œÉœçŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÜŒµ ŒºœÄŒ±œÅŒºœÄŒ± ŒìŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑\\", œÑŒøœÖ Œ§œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ¨œÜœÖŒªŒªŒøœÖ ŒúŒ∑œÑŒ±œÜŒØŒ¥Œ∑, ŒëŒìŒìŒïŒõŒôŒüŒ¶ŒüŒ°ŒüŒ£, ŒïœÄœâŒΩœçŒºœâœÇ, ŒîŒµœÖœÑŒ≠œÅŒ± 7/1/08 In 1936, after the violent suppression of the workers' revolt, he was found guilty by the Felony Court of Edessa, along with another 52 workers, as organiser of the Thessaloniki strike, in May 1936. He was sent into internal exile, based on the idionymon law, from 1937 to 1942. The Tsouderos government, before fleeing the country in April 1941, exiled him to Gavdos. A lot of his fellow detainees who had been exiled in Gavdos, were handed over to the German occupation authorities and later executed during the Axis Occupation of Greece. Identifying himself as a revolutionary, he didn't fight in the Second World War, because he believed that the National Liberation Front was working in favour of the self-exiled Greek government, in order to liberate the Greek middle class. In 1942, he met Cornelius Castoriadis and adopted after a few years his opinion on the bureaucratisation of the communist parties. Based on these positions, he quit Troskyism in 1947. Along with his comrades, Agis Stinas, Dimosthenis Voursoukis, Makris, Krokos, Castoriadis et al., he believed in the principles of defeatism and of revolutionary internationalism, by promoting an autonomous, self-organised society and asking for the alliance among all of the fighting soldiers. Due to this position, Tamtakos and his comrades were persecuted by the German occupiers, the Security Battalions, but also from the antinazi forces. He managed to escape assassination efforts by National Liberation Front (Greece) quite a few times while he used several identities and nicknames during the period of the occupation and of the liberation of Greece.ŒíŒµœÅŒ≥ŒÆœÇ, Œì.

There has been tremendous growth in India's housing sector as incomes have risen. Low income housing According to the Times of India, \\"a majority of Indians have per capita space equivalent to or less than a 10 feet x 10 feet room for their living, sleeping, cooking, washing and toilet needs.\\" The average is 103 sq ft per person in rural areas and 117 sq ft per person in urban areas. 99 percent of rural households have access to electricity. Although cities have better facilities than villages in India & provides full-day water supply. Almost all States such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and others provides a continuous power supply. Indian Green Building Council Provides maximum support to all the state and central governments with respect to affordable housing IGBC is the country's premier body for green Building certification https://igbc.in/igbc/ Cities Mumbai The Imperial Towers, Mumbai are the 2nd tallest buildings in India. Mumbai experiences similar urbanisation challenges as other fast growing cities in developing countries: wide disparities in housing between the affluent, middle-income and low-income segments of the population. Highly desirable neighborhoods such as Colaba, Malabar Hill, Marine Drive, Bandra and Juhu house professionals, industrialists, Bollywood movie stars and expatriates. Up-scale flats have 3 or more bedrooms, ocean views, tasteful interior decoration, parking for luxury cars and sleeping quarters for maids and cooks. In 2007, Mumbai condominiums were the priciest in the developing world at around US$9,000 to US$10,200 per square metre. Mumbai has more than 1,500 high rise buildings, many of which are just planned, but some already constructed or under construction. Despite the recent economic growth, there is still some poverty, unemployment and therefore, poor housing conditions for a huge section of the population. With available space at a premium, working-class Mumbai residents often reside in cramped and poor quality, yet relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces. Despite this, Mumbai's economic boom continues to attract migrants in search of opportunities from across the country. The number of migrants to Mumbai from outside Maharashtra during the 1991‚Äì2001 decade was 1.12 million, which amounted to 54.8% of the net addition to the population of Mumbai. Over 7 million people, over 42% of the population of Mumbai, live in informal housing or slums, yet they cover only 6‚Äì8% of the city's land area. Slums were recognized as a problem as early as in 1919 by the Bombay Municipal Corporation. Slum growth rate in Mumbai is greater than the general urban growth rate. Financial Times writes that \\"Dharavi is the grand panjandrum of the Mumbai slums\\". Dharavi, Asia's second-largest slum is located in central Mumbai and houses over 1 million people. Slums are a growing tourist attraction in Mumbai. Most of the remaining live in chawls and on footpaths. Chawls are a quintessentially Mumbai phenomenon of multi-storied terrible quality tenements, typically a bit higher quality than slums. 80 per cent of chawls have only one room. Pavement dwellers refers to Mumbai dwellings built on the footpaths/pavements of city streets. With rising incomes, many residents of slums and chawls now have modern amenities such as mobile phones, access to electricity, often illegally, and television. Rent control laws have helped to create a housing shortage. Most of the investors are looking to invest in ongoing real estate projects to get maximum returns. The MMRDA has released the Mumbai Development Plan for 2034 which discusses means of creating affordable housing, including a criticised proposal to build on salt pan land. Delhi Delhi has witnessed rapid suburban growth over the past decade. South Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida have added thousands of apartment buildings, Affordable Homes, shopping centres and highways. New Delhi's famous Lutyens bungalows house the prime minister, members of his cabinet, top political and government leaders, military officials, senior judges and top bureaucrats. New Delhi is also home to thousands of diplomatic staff of foreign countries and the United Nations. With India's growth, Delhi has developed into a business center, especially for outsourcing, IT consultancy, high-tech, research, education and health care services. Employees of these institutions are the source of growing demand for high-end housing provided by major builders such as DLF. Bangalore In the 1990s the information technology boom hit Bangalore. Y2K projects in America's IT industry resulted in shortages for skilled computer scientists and systems programmers. Bangalore has transformed into the Silicon Valley of India as over 500,000 well-paying jobs for young college graduates were created. The demographics of the city changed, new high-rise were built, campus-style office parks sprouted, vast shopping centers started to thrive, streets became crowded with new cars and gated expatriate housing estates emerged , housing estates emerged, https://homesandloansblog.wordpress.com. Roughly 10% of Bangalore's population lives in slums.. Census of India, 2001. 2006. Government of India. Kolkata (Calcutta) The most sought-after neighbourhoods of Calcutta are generally centered around Lower Circular Road, Sarat Bose Road, Salt Lake, Ballygunge, Anwar Shah Road, Chowringhee and Golf Green. A recent building boom has converted sprawling British-era bungalows into high-rise condominiums and apartment-buildings with modern amenities. Kolkata currently has the second most number of highrises and tall buildings in the country, second only to Mumbai. The highest of them is at 65 floors (The 42). New suburbs are constantly being developed in Rajarhat and along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. These suburbs will consist of major condominiums, complete with penthouses, many designed primarily for NRIs, expats and affluent residents. The tallest buildings in the city, The South City Towers and Urbana towers, are also condominiums. North Calcutta contains mansions built in the early 20th century during Calcutta's heyday as capital of British India. These buildings feature a courtyard surrounded by balconies, large rooms with tall ceilings, marble floors, tall pillars and crumbling artwork. Most of them are poorly maintained. The Marble Palace and other buildings received \\"heritage status\\" which provides them municipal funds and incentives to repair and restore. These mansions serve as reminder of the era of Bengali Renaissance. It's estimated that 5% of the population live in slums. Although the number of slums are less than Mumbai, they are scattered all over Kolkata in between affluent areas giving the city a rustic and poverty driven look. Hyderabad In Hyderabad, housing in modern ages in the 21st century is more modernized and developed than it has been in the past. The housing sector in Hyderabad has relatively sophisticated infrastructure. and is suitable for gated communities and villas, as well as higher-standard flats and condominiums. Hyderabad is home to several skyscrapers, including The Botanika, Lodha Belezza, etc. Roughly 15% of population is living in slum presently. Many residential infrastructure companies are well-established in Hyderabad. Corruption In general India's crime rates trails those of other developing countries. There is a large developed housing market with major builders and promoters. Some municipal and other government officials, elected politicians, real estate developers and a few law enforcement officials, acquire, develop and sell land in illegal ways.K.R. Gupta and J.R.

Indian property bubble The Indian property bubble refers to the concern expressed by some Indian economists that housing market in some major Indian cities may be in a bubble. The real estate sector is thought to be collapsing due to increasing costs of financing. Real estate projects in India take a long time to complete due to a complicated and corrupt regulatory mechanism. Several of the India's publicly traded real estate firms are in debt. The inventory of unsold real estate assets is growing and it is expected the market will undergo price corrections. According to Mumbai-based market research agency, Liases Foras, 30% of the transaction in the real estate sector is done with black money. In September 2019, India announced that it will provide $1.41 billion of funds to boost affordable and middle income housing, as part of measures designed to aid India‚Äôs slowing economy.

Despite peaking lower than her No. 1 UK comeback hit \\"Sailor\\", \\"Romeo\\" earned Clark her first Gold record by selling 400,000 units in the UK. In Ireland \\"Romeo\\" reached No. 2. Jean Broussolle who had translated Clark's precedent hit \\"Sailor\\" rendered \\"Romeo\\" as \\"Rom√©o\\" which became Clark's first No. 1 hit in France on 20 January 1962 ‚Äì Clark's next two singles would also reach No. 1 in France where overall she'd top the charts five times. \\"Rom√©o\\" was also ranked at No. 1 on the chart for the Wallonia region of Belgium while the original English version had been a hit (#2) in Belgium's Flemish region. \\"Romeo\\" also achieved hit status in Denmark (#3), the Netherlands (#10), Norway (#7) and Australia (#25). Cover versions ;\\"Romeo\\" * Rina Pia (nl) recorded a Flemish rendering of \\"Rom√©o\\" which reached No. 3 on Belgium's Dutch chart in the autumn of 1962. * A Czech rendering of \\"Romeo\\" was recorded in 1963 by Yvetta Simonov√° (cs). ;\\"Salome\\" * An earlier English-language rendering of \\"Salome\\" by lyricist Bartley Costello entitled \\"Sal-o-may\\" had been published in 1920 but was evidently never recorded although instrumental versions of Stolz' piece were recorded under the title \\"Sal-o-may\\" by the Paul Biese Trio and also by the Joseph C. Smith Orchestra in 1921. * A hit in Germany in the summer of 1961 via a recording by Lucas Quartett (de) (chart peak #20), the German-language original version of \\"Salome\\" has also been recorded by Medium-Terzett (de) (album Weit ist die Welt/ 1967), Harry Friedauer (album \\"Mit Musik Geht Alles Besser/ 1969), Heino (album La Montanara/ 1973), and Extrabreit (album Welch Ein Land! ‚Äì Was F√ºr M√§nner√©/ 1981), while a Finnish rendering was recorded in 1961 by Kukonpojat (fi). * An Italian version of Stolz's \\"Salome\\" entitled \\"Abat-jour\\",lyric by Ennio Neri,in late 1950s(?) and recorded by Nilo Ossani (it) and remade by Aurelio Fierro, reached No. 4 on the Italian hit parade in September 1962 to rank as the year's No. 9 hit via a remake by Henry Wright (it) which bested a rival version by Milva. The success of Wright's \\"Abat-jour\\", which was perceived as a local cover version of Clark's \\"Romeo\\" prompted the decision to have Clark herself cut songs for the Italian market. **Henry Wright's version of \\"Abat-jour\\" is prominently featured in the 1963 film Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow: Sophia Loren, playing the prostitute Mara, plays Wright's record as the background music for the strip tease she performs for a client played by Marcello Mastroianni. The 1994 film Pr√™t-√†-Porter featured Loren and Mastroianni in what was in effect a remake of the strip tease scene from Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow with Wright's \\"Abat-jour\\" again played as background music. * Kukonpojat (fi) recorded a version of \\"Salome\\" with Finnish lyrics in 1961.

The current demarcation between this period and the Early history of the Philippines is April 21, 900, which is the equivalent on the Proleptic Gregorian calendar for the date indicated on the Laguna Copperplate Inscription‚Äîthe earliest known surviving written record to come from the Philippines. This period saw the immense change that took hold of the archipelago from Stone Age cultures in the fourth century, continuing on with the gradual widening of trade until 900 and the first surviving written records. Pleistocene Butchered remains of a Rhinoceros philippinensis found in Rizal, Kalinga. An evidence of early hominins in the Philippines about 709,000 years ago. Kalinga Artifacts and Fossil Fauna Remains A 2018 study led by Thomas Ingicco pushes back the arrival of the first Homo species on the Philippines between 631,000 and 777,000 years ago in a period known today as Pleistocene. This was on the wake of the analysis conducted using several dating techniques to the rhino remains unearthed in a Kalinga site. =Site Description= Unearthed in the site was a 'nearly complete, disarticulated' rhinoceros skeleton, of the extinct species Rhinoceros philippinensis. It showed ridges left by tools made while removing flesh, and special tools designed to remove bone marrow. The site yielded more than 400 bones, including several dozen knapped and chipped tools, of which 49 are knife-like flakes with two hammers. Also, among the finds are other skeletal remains, which include brown deer, monitor lizards, freshwater turtles and stegodonts. =Hominins= While the earliest confirmed evidence of a hominin came from a 67,000-year-old foot bone from Sierra Madre discovered in 2007, those finds had no direct trace of the butchers of the animals. On the other hand, it is possible that the butchers had by then evolved into a distinct subspecies.  Callao Man (c. 67,000 years ago)  The earliest known hominin remains in the Philippines is the fossil discovered in 2007 in the Callao Caves in Cagayan. The 67,000-year-old find predates the 47,000-year-old Tabon Man, which was until then the earliest known set of human remains in the archipelago. The find consisted of a single 61 millimeter metatarsal which was dated using uranium series ablation. It was initially thought to be possibly one of the oldest Homo sapiens remains in the Asia- Pacific.Severino, Howie G. (August 1, 2010). Researchers discover fossil of human older than Tabon Man.

In the same stratigraphic layer where the third metatarsal was discovered, continued excavations revealed 12 fossil bones (7 postcanine maxillary teeth, 2 manual phalanges, 2 pedal phalanges, 1 femoral shaft) from three hominin individuals. These remains and the Callao Man were identified to belong to a new species of hominins, Homo luzonensis.  Stone Age (c. 50,000 ‚Äì c. 500 BC)  The first evidence of the systematic use of Stone Age technology in the Philippines is estimated to 50,000 BC, and this phase in the development of proto-Philippine societies is considered to end with the rise of metal tools in about 500 BC, albeit with stone tools still used past that date. Filipino anthropologist F. Landa Jocano refers to the earliest noticeable stage in the development of proto-Philippine societies as the Formative Phase. He also identified stone tools and ceramic manufacture as the two core industries that defined the period's economic activity, and which shaped the means by which early Filipinos adapted to their environment during this period. By about 30,000 BC, the Negritos, who became the ancestors of today's aboriginal Filipinos (such as the Aeta), probably lived in the archipelago. No evidence has survived which would indicate details of ancient Filipino life such as their crops, culture, and architecture. Historian William Henry Scott noted any theory which describes such details for the period must be pure hypothesis, and thus be honestly presented as such.  Tabon Man (c. 24,000 or 22,000 BC)  Fossilized fragments of a skull and jawbone of three individuals had been discovered on May 28, 1962 by Dr. Robert B. Fox, an American anthropologist of the National Museum.; , citing . These fragments are collectively called \\"Tabon Man\\" after the place where they were found on the west coast of Palawan. Tabon Cave appears to be a kind of a Stone Age factory, with both finished stone flake tools and waste core flakes having been found at four separate levels in the main chamber. Charcoal left from three assemblages of cooking fires there has been Carbon-14 dated to roughly 7,000, 20,000, and 22,000 BC.. (In Mindanao, the existence and importance of these prehistoric tools was noted by famed Jos√© Rizal himself, because of his acquaintance with Spanish and German scientific archaeologists in the 1880s, while in Europe.) Tabon Cave is named after the \\"Tabon bird\\" (Tabon scrubfowl, Megapodius cumingii), which deposited thick hard layers of guano during the period when the cave was still uninhabited, resulting to a cement-like floor made of bird dung where three succeeding groups of tool-makers settled. It is indicated that about half of the 3,000 specimens recovered from the cave are discarded cores of a material which had to be transported from some distance. The Tabon man fossils are considered to have come from the third group of inhabitants who inhabited the cave between 22,000 and 20,000 BC. An earlier cave level lies so far below the level containing cooking fire assemblages that it must represent Upper Pleistocene dates from 45 or 50 thousand years ago. Physical anthropologists who have examined the Tabon Man skullcap have agreed that it belonged to a modern man (Homo sapiens), as distinguished from the mid-Pleistocene Homo erectus species. This indicates that Tabon Man was Pre-Mongoloid (Mongoloid being the term anthropologists apply to the racial stock which entered Southeast Asia during the Holocene and absorbed earlier peoples to produce the modern Malay, Indonesian, Filipino, and \\"Pacific\\" peoples). Two experts have given the opinion that the mandible is \\"Australian\\" in physical type, and that the skullcap measurements are most nearly like the Ainus or Tasmanians. Nothing can be concluded about Tabon man's physical appearance from the recovered skull fragments except that he was not a Negrito. The custom of Jar Burial, which ranges from Sri Lanka, to the Plain of Jars, in Laos, to Japan, also was practiced in the Tabon caves. A spectacular example of a secondary burial jar is owned by the National Museum, a National Treasure, with a jar lid topped with two figures, one the deceased, arms crossed, hands touching the shoulders, the other a steersman, both seated in a proa, with only the mast missing from the piece. Secondary burial was practiced across all the islands of the Philippines during this period, with the bones reburied, some in the burial jars. Seventy-eight earthenware vessels were recovered from the Manunggul cave, Palawan, specifically for burial. Migration theories There have been many models of early human migration to the Philippines. Since H. Otley Beyer first proposed his wave migration theory, numerous scholars have approached the question of how, when and why humans first came to the Philippines. The question of whether the first humans arrived from the south (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei as suggested by Beyer) or from the north (via Taiwan as suggested by the Austronesian theory) has been a subject of heated debate for decades. As new discoveries come to light, past hypotheses are reevaluated and new theories constructed. =Beyer's wave migration theory (Theory of Waves of Migration)= The first, and most widely known theory of the prehistoric peopling of the Philippines is that of H. Otley Beyer, founder of the Anthropology Department of the University of the Philippines., citing Beyer Memorial Issue on the Prehistory of the Philippines in Philippine Studies, Vol. 15:No. 1 (January 1967). According to Dr. Beyer, the ancestors of the Filipinos came to the islands first via land bridges which would occur during times when the sea level was low, and then later in seagoing vessels such as the balangay. Thus he differentiated these ancestors as arriving in different \\"waves of migration\\", as follows:. :# \\"Dawn Man\\", a type similar to Java man, Peking Man, and other Asian Homo erectus of 250,000 years ago. :# The aboriginal pygmy group, the Negritos, who arrived between 25,000 and 30,000 years ago. :# The seafaring tool-using \\"Indonesian\\" group who arrived about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago and were the first immigrants to reach the Philippines by sea. :# The seafaring \\"Malays\\" who brought the Iron Age culture and were the real colonizers and dominant cultural group in the pre-Hispanic Philippines. Beyer's theory, while still popular among lay Filipinos, has been generally been disputed by anthropologists and historians. Reasons for doubting it are founded on Beyer's use of 19th century scientific methods of progressive evolution and migratory diffusion as the basis for his hypothesis. These methods have since been proven to be too simple and unreliable to explain the prehistoric peopling of the Philippines.. =Objections to the land bridges theory= In February 1976, Fritjof Voss, a German scientist who studied the geology of the Philippines, questioned the validity of the theory of land bridges. He maintained that the Philippines was never part of mainland Asia. He claimed that it arose from the bottom of the sea and, as the thin Pacific crust moved below it, continued to rise. It continues to rise today. The country lies along great Earth faults that extend to deep submarine trenches. The resulting violent earthquakes caused what is now the land masses forming the Philippines to rise to the surface of the sea. Dr. Voss also pointed out that when scientific studies were done on the Earth's crust from 1964 to 1967, it was discovered that the 35-kilometer- thick crust underneath China does not reach the Philippines. Thus, the latter could not have been a land bridge to the Asian mainland. The matter of who the first settlers were has not been really resolved. This is being disputed by anthropologists, as well as Professor H. Otley Beyer, who claims that the first inhabitants of the Philippines came from the Malay Peninsula. The Malays now constitute the largest portion of the populace and what Filipinos now have is an Austronesian culture. Philippine historian William Henry Scott has pointed out that Palawan and the Calamianes Islands are separated from Borneo by water nowhere deeper than 100 meters, that south of a line drawn between Saigon and Brunei does the depth of the South China Sea nowhere exceeds 100 meters, and that the Strait of Malacca reaches 50 meters only at one point.. Scott also asserts that the Sulu Archipelago is not the peak of a submerged mountain range connecting Mindanao and Borneo, but the exposed edge of three small ridges produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom in recent geologic times. According to Scott, it is clear that Palawan and the Calamianes do not stand on a submerged land bridge, but were once a hornlike protuberance on the shoulder of a continent whose southern shoreline used to be the present islands of Java and Borneo. Mindoro and the Calamianes are separated by a channel more than 500 meters deep. =Bellwood's Austronesian diffusion theory (Austronesian Model)= The popular contemporary alternative to Beyer's model is Peter Bellwood‚Äôs Out-of-Taiwan (OOT) hypothesis, which is based largely on linguistics, hewing very close to Robert Blust‚Äôs model of the history of the Austronesian language family, and supplementing it with archeological data. citing This model suggests that between 4500 BC and 4000 BC, developments in agricultural technology in the Yunnan Plateau in China created pressures which drove certain peoples to migrate to Taiwan. These people either already had or began to develop a unique language of their own, now referred to as Proto- Austronesian. By around 3000 BC, these groups started differentiating into three or four distinct subcultures, and by 2500 to 1500 BC, one of these groups began migrating southwards towards the Philippines and Indonesia, reaching as far as Borneo and the Moluccas by 1500 BC, forming new cultural groupings and developing unique languages. By 1500 BC, some of these groups started migrating west, reaching as far as Madagascar around the 1st millennium. Others migrated east, settling as far as Easter Island by the mid-13th century, giving the Austronesian language group the distinction of being one of the most widely distributed language groups in the world at that time, in terms of the geographical span of the homelands of its languages. According to this theory, the peoples of the Philippines are the descendants of those cultures who remained on the Philippine islands when others moved first southwards, then eastward and westward. =Solheim's Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network (NMTCN) or island origin theory= Wilhelm Solheim's concept of the Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network (NMTCN), while not strictly a theory regarding the biological ancestors of modern Southeast Asians, does suggest that the patterns of cultural diffusion throughout the Asia-Pacific region are not what would be expected if such cultures were to be explained by simple migration. Where Bellwood based his analysis primarily on linguistic analysis, Solheim's approach was based on artifact findings. On the basis of a careful analysis of artifacts, he suggests the existence of a trade and communication network that first spread in the Asia-Pacific region during its Neolithic age (c.8,000 to 500 BC). According to Solheim's NMTCN theory, this trade network, consisting of both Austronesian and non-Austronesian seafaring peoples, was responsible for the spread of cultural patterns throughout the Asia-Pacific region, not the simple migration proposed by the Out-of-Taiwan hypothesis. Solheim came up with four geographical divisions delineating the spread of the NMTCN over time, calling these geographical divisions \\"lobes.\\" Specifically, these were the central, northern, eastern and western lobes. The central lobe was further divided into two smaller lobes reflecting phases of cultural spread: the Early Central Lobe and the Late Central Lobe. Instead of Austronesian peoples originating from Taiwan, Solheim placed the origins of the early NMTCN peoples in the \\"Early Central Lobe,\\" which was in eastern coastal Vietnam, at around 9000 BC. He then suggests the spread of peoples around 5000 BC towards the \\"Late central lobe\\", including the Philippines, via island Southeast Asia, rather than from the north as the Taiwan theory suggests. Thus, from the Point of view of the Philippine peoples, the NMTCN is also referred to as the Island Origin Theory. Ifugao hogang, guardian spirits carved from tree fern trunks, overlooking the Banaue Rice Terraces This \\"late central lobe\\" included southern China and Taiwan, which became \\"the area where Austronesian became the original language family and Malayo-Polynesian developed.\\" In about 4000 to 3000 BC, these peoples continued spreading east through Northern Luzon to Micronesia to form the Early Eastern Lobe, carrying the Malayo-Polynesian languages with them. These languages would become part of the culture spread by the NMTCN in its expansions Malaysia and western towards Malaysia before 2000 BC, continuing along coastal India and Sri Lanka up to the western coast of Africa and Madagascar; and over time, further eastward towards its easternmost borders at Easter Island. Thus, as in the case of Bellwood's theory, the Austronesian languages spread eastward and westward from the area around the Philippines. Aside from the matter of the origination of peoples, the difference between the two theories is that Bellwood's theory suggests a linear expansion, while Solheim's suggests something more akin to concentric circles, all overlapping in the geographical area of the late central lobe which includes the Philippines. =Jocano's local origins theory (Core Population)= Another alternative model is that asserted by anthropologist F. Landa Jocano of the University of the Philippines, who in 2001 contended that the existing fossil evidence of ancient humans demonstrates that they not only migrated to the Philippines, but also to New Guinea, Borneo, and Australia. In reference to Beyer's wave model, he points out that there is no definitive way to determine the \\"race\\" of the human fossils; the only certain thing is that the discovery of Tabon Man proves that the Philippines was inhabited as early as 21,000 or 22,000 years ago. If this is true, the first inhabitants of the Philippines would not have come from the Malay Peninsula. Instead, Jocano postulates that present day Filipinos are products of the long process of evolution and movement of people. He also adds that this is also true of Indonesians and Malaysians, with none among the three peoples being the dominant carrier of culture. In fact, he suggests that the ancient humans who populated Southeast Asia cannot be categorized under any of these three groups. He thus further suggests that it is not correct to consider Filipino culture as being Malayan in orientation. Genetic studies =2001 Stanford University study= A Stanford University study conducted during 2001 revealed that Haplogroup O3-M122 (labeled as \\"Haplogroup L\\" in this study) is the most common Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup found among Filipinos. This particular haplogroup is also predominant among Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese. Another haplogroup, Haplogroup O1a-M119 (labeled as \\"Haplogroup H\\" in this study), is also found among Filipinos. The rates of Haplogroup O1a are highest among the Taiwanese aborigines, and Chamic-speaking people. Genetic data found among a sampling of Filipinos may indicate some relation to the Ami tribe of Taiwan. =2008 Leeds University study= A 2008 genetic study showed no evidence of a large-scale Taiwanese migration into the Philippine Islands. A study by Leeds University and published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, showed that mitochondrial DNA lineages have been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) since modern humans arrived approximately 50,000 years ago. Population dispersals occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which resulted in migrations from the Philippine Islands into Taiwan within the last 10,000 years. = Other studies = Migration of the Austronesian peoples and their languages. A 2002 China Medical University study indicated that some Filipinos shared genetic chromosome that is found among Asian people, such as Taiwanese aborigines, Indonesians, Thais, and Chinese. In a 2003 research study by the University of the Philippines, genetic mutations were found in Filipinos which are shared by people from different parts of East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The predominant genotype detected was SC, the Southeast Asian genotype. However, only about 50 urine samples were collected for the study, far below the minimum sample size needed to account for credible test results. A 2013 study on the genetics and origin of Polynesian people supported the Out of Taiwan scenario of Austronesian expansion from Taiwan, through the Philippines and Indonesia, and into Polynesia. = Conclusions = These indigenous elements in the Filipino's genetic makeup serve as clues to the patterns of migration throughout Philippine prehistory. After the 16th century, of course, the colonial period saw the influx of genetic influence from European colonizers. During the above-mentioned study conducted by Stanford University Asia-Pacific Research Center, it was stated that 3.6% of the Philippine population has varying degrees of European ancestry from Spanish, and American colonization. However, only 28 individuals from the Philippines were genotyped for this study, again a sample size far below the minimum sample size needed to account for credible test results in a population of over 90 million individuals. However, the Stanford study is conflicted by the findings of the open-source Y-DNA bank of the company, Applied Biosystems,With a sample population of 105 Filipinos, the company of Applied Biosystems, analyses the Y-DNA of the average Filipino. which found out that most Philippine Y-DNA haplogroups were found to be O3 and O2, which comes from East Asia, Southeast Asia and Polynesia but also concluded that those that carry the percentage of Spanish Y-DNA haplogroups, were higher at around 13.33% of the population (haplogroup R1b). Compared to the 28 individuals used by Stanford which they sampled from the rural areas of isolated Palawan island, the Y-DNA bank had analyzed 105 Filipino individuals from all across the country.With a sample population of 105 Filipinos, the company of Applied Biosystems, analysed the Y-DNA of average Filipinos and it is discovered that about 0.95% of the samples have the Y-DNA Haplotype \\"H1a\\", which is most common in South Asia and had spread to the Philippines via precolonial Indian missionaries who spread Hinduism and established Indic Rajahnates like Cebu and Butuan. Furthermore, according to a Y-DNA compilation by the DNA company Applied Biosystems, they calculated an estimated 1% frequency of the South Asian Y-DNA \\"H1a\\" in the Philippines. Thus translating to about 1,011,864 Filipinos having full or partial Indian descent, not including other Filipinos in the Philippines and Filipinos abroad whose DNA (Y-DNA) have not been analyzed. Proto- Austronesians The world in 1000 BCE shows the societies in the Philippine islands and its neighbors at the time. Before the expansion out of Taiwan, recent archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidence has linked Austronesian speakers in Insular Southeast Asia to cultures such as the Hemudu, Liangzhu and Dapenkeng in Neolithic China. Bolobok Archaeological Site (6810‚Äì3190 BC) The site is one of the earliest human settlement zones in the region. The site itself is part of a huge karst system with layers of shells and other minerals made by early humans. More excavation led to discovery of ancient artifacts like flake tools, polished stones, earthenware shards, bone tools and some animal remains. These remains and artifacts were dated by C-14 to be around 8,810 to 5,190 years ago, making the site one of the most significant archaeological sites in the region. The site was declared an Important Cultural Property in 2017 by the National Government. 5000‚Äì2000 BC‚ÄîAustronesian speakers arrive Deer hunting Natives. Historian William Henry Scott has observed that, based on lexicostatistical analysis involving seven million word pairs linguist Isidore Dyen offered in 1962, two alternative scenarios explaining the origin and spread of Austronesian languages: (a) that they originated in some Pacific island and spread westward to Asia, or (b) that they originated in Taiwan and spread southward.. Based on subsequent study of the second alternative, Scott concludes that the Philippine language tree could have been introduced by Austronesian speakers as long ago as 5000 BC, probably from the north, with their descendants expanding throughout the Philippine archipelago and beyond in succeeding millennia, absorbing or replacing sparse populations already present, and their language diversifying into dozens of mutually unintelligible languages which replaced earlier ones. During those millennia, other Austronesian speakers entered the Philippines in large enough numbers to leave a linguistic mark but not to replace established languages. Scott suggested that if this scenario is correct all present Philippine languages (except for Sama‚ÄìBajaw languages, which probably have more speakers outside the Philippines than within) were produced within the archipelago, none of them being introduced by separate migration, and all of them having more in common with each other than with languages outside of the Philippines. During this neolithic period, a \\"jade culture\\" is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found at a site in Batangas province.

The new tools brought about a more stable way of life, and created more opportunities for communities to grow, both in terms of size and cultural development. Where communities once consisted of small bands of kinsmen living in campsites, larger villages came about- usually based near water, which made traveling and trading easier. The resulting ease of contact between communities meant that they began to share similar cultural traits, something which had not previously been possible when the communities consisted only of small kinship groups. Jocano refers to the period between 500 BC and 1 AD as the incipient phase, which for the first time in the artifact record, sees the presence of artifacts that are similar in design from site to site throughout the archipelago. Along with the use of metal tools, this era also saw significant improvement in pottery technology. Proto-historic era Sa huyun culture  The Sa Huynh culture showed evidence of an extensive trade network. Sa Huynh beads were made from glass, carnelian, agate, olivine, zircon, gold and garnet; most of these materials were not local to the region, and were most likely imported. Han Dynasty-style bronze mirrors were also found in Sa Huynh sites. Conversely, Sa Huynh produced ear ornaments have been found in archaeological sites in Central Thailand, Taiwan (Orchid Island), and in the Philippines, in the Palawan Tabon Caves. in The Kalanay Cave is a small cave located on the island of Masbate in central Philippines. The cave is located specifically at the northwest coast of the island within the municipality of Aroroy. The artifacts recovered from the site were similar to those found in Southeast Asia and South Vietnam. The site is one of the \\"Sa Huynh-Kalanay\\" pottery complex which is shares similarities with Vietnam. The type of pottery found in the site were dated 400BC-1500 AD. 100 BC onward Iron Age finds in Philippines also point to the existence of trade between Tamil Nadu and the Philippine Islands during the ninth and tenth centuries B.C. The Philippines is believed by some historians to be the island of Chryse, the \\"Golden One,\\" which is the name given by ancient Greek writers in reference to an island rich in gold east of India. Pomponius Mela, Marinos of Tyre and the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentioned this island in 100 BC, and it is basically the equivalent to the Indian Suvarnadvipa, the \\"Island of Gold.\\" Josephus calls it in Latin Aurea, and equates the island with biblical Ophir, from where the ships of Tyre and Solomon brought back gold and other trade items. Ptolemy locates the islands of Chryse east of the Khruses Kersonenson, the \\"Golden Peninsula,\\" i.e. the Malaya Peninsula. North of Chryse in the Periplus was Thin, which some consider the first European reference to China. In about the 200 BC, there arose a practice of using gold eye covers, and then, gold facial orifice covers to adorn the dead resulting in an increase of ancient gold finds. During the Qin dynasty and the Tang dynasty, China was well aware of the golden lands far to the south. The Buddhist pilgrim I-Tsing mentions Chin- Chou, \\"Isle of Gold\\" in the archipelago south of China on his way back from India. Medieval Muslims refer to the islands as the Kingdoms of Zabag and WƒÅ·∏≥wƒÅ·∏≥, rich in gold, referring, perhaps, to the eastern islands of the Malay archipelago, the location of present-day Philippines and Eastern Indonesia.Zabag. Retrieved September 2, 2008. Thalassocracies and international trade (200 AD onwards) =The emergence of Barangay city- states and trade (200‚Äì500)= Since at least the 3rd century, the indigenous peoples were in contact with other Southeast Asian and East Asian nations. Fragmented ethnic groups established numerous city-states formed by the assimilation of several small political units known as barangay each headed by a Datu or headman (still in use among non-Hispanic Filipino ethnic groups) and answerable to a king, titled Rajah. Even scattered barangays, through the development of inter-island and international trade, became more culturally homogeneous by the 4th century. Hindu-Buddhist culture and religion flourished among the noblemen in this era. Many of the barangay were, to varying extents, under the de jure jurisprudence of one of several neighboring empires, among them the Malay Sri Vijaya, Javanese Majapahit, Brunei, Melaka empires, although de facto had established their own independent system of rule. Trading links with Sumatra, Borneo, Thailand, Java, China, India, Arabia, Japan and the Ryukyu Kingdom flourished during this era. A thalassocracy had thus emerged based on international trade.(archived from the original on August 1, 2010) Each barangay consisted of about 100 families. Some barangays were big, such as Zubu (Cebu), Butuan, Maktan (Mactan),Mandani (Mandaue), Lalan (Liloan), Irong-Irong (Iloilo), Bigan (Vigan), and Selurong (Manila). Each of these big barangays had a population of more than 2,000. In the earliest times, the items which were prized by the peoples included jars, which were a symbol of wealth throughout South Asia, and later metal, salt and tobacco. In exchange, the peoples would trade feathers, rhino horn, hornbill beaks, beeswax, birds nests, resin, rattan.2 In the period between the 7th century to the beginning of the 15th century, numerous prosperous centers of trade had emerged, including the Kingdom of Namayan which flourished alongside Manila Bay, ^ . Cebu, Iloilo,Remains of ancient barangays in many parts of Iloilo testify to the antiquity and richness of these pre-colonial settlements. Pre-hispanic burial grounds are found in many towns of Iloilo. These burial grounds contained antique porcelain burial jars and coffins made of hard wood, where the dead were put to rest with abundance of gold, crystal beads, Chinese potteries, and golden masks. These Philippine national treasures are sheltered in Museo de Iloilo and in the collections of many Ilonngo old families. Early Spanish colonizers took note of the ancient civilizations in Iloilo and their organized social structure ruled by nobilities. In the late 16th Century, Fray Gaspar de San Agustin in his chronicles about the ancient settlements in Panay says: ‚ÄúTambi√©n fund√≥ convento el Padre Fray Martin de Rada en Araut- que ahora se llama el convento de Dumangas- con la advocaci√≥n de nuestro Padre San Agust√≠n...Est√° fundado este pueblo casi a los fines del r√≠o de Halaur, que naciendo en unos altos montes en el centro de esta isla (Panay)...Es el pueblo muy hermoso, ameno y muy lleno de palmares de cocos.

Introduction of metal The introduction of metal into the Philippines and the resulting changes did not follow the typical pattern. Robert Fox notes, \\"There is, for example, no real evidence of a \\"Bronze Age\\" or \\"Copper-Bronze Age\\" in the archipelago, a development which occurred in many areas of the world. The transition, as shown by recent excavation, was from stone tools to iron tools.\\" The earliest use of metal in the Philippines was the use of copper for ornamentation, not tools. Even when copper and bronze tools became common, they were often used side by side with stone tools. Metal only became the dominant material for tools late in this era, leading to a new phase in cultural development. Bronze tools from the Philippines' early metal age have been encountered in various sites, but they were not widespread. This has been attributed to the lack of a local source of tin, which when combined with copper produces bronze. This lack has led most anthropologists to conclude that bronze items were imported and that those bronze smelting sites which have been found in the Philippines, in Palawan, were for re-smelting and remolding. Introduction of iron Iron Age finds in Philippines also point to the existence of trade between Tamil Nadu and the Philippine Islands during the ninth and tenth centuries B.C. When iron was introduced to the Philippines, it became the preferred material for tools and largely ended the use of stone tools. Whether the iron was imported or mined locally is still debated by scholars. Beyer thought that it was mined locally, but others point to the lack of iron smelting artifacts and conclude that the iron tools were probably imported. Metalsmiths from this era had already developed a crude version of modern metallurgical processes, notably the hardening of soft iron through carburization. Archaeological sources Until very recently, scholars have limited sources or access to artifacts discovered since the 19th century. During the Spanish colonial era, which began in 1521, many artifacts were destroyed or re-used. A good example is the Spanish walled city of Intramuros in Manila, whose stone bricks were taken from the original city wall of pre-Hispanic Maynila. As new evidence is discovered, old theories are adapted or new ones developed, which has led to numerous and sometimes conflicting theories about the prehistory of the Philippines, leading to a lack of consensus among archaeologists and historians.

It is a row of about 200 shops that line either side of the road for about a kilometre. History Burma Bazaar was established by Burmese immigrants, who were Tamil refugees who fled Myanmar during the early 1960s. The government set aside land for the Tamil refugees returning from Burma during the 1960s. The bazaar is run by the Burma Tamizhar Marumalarchi Sangam, an association that has been set up to look after the interests of the traders since 1966. The bazaar The bazaar extends to about a kilometre along the Chennai Beach railway station. There are an estimated 200 shops in the bazaar. With several passengers coming out of the station every few minutes, the market appears busy all the time. It is estimated that over 100,000 people pass through this corridor every week.

The Kallar, along with the Maravar and Agamudayar, constitute a united social caste on the basis of parallel professions, though their locations and heritages are wholly separate from one another. Etymology Kallar is a Tamil word meaning thief. Their history has included periods of banditry. Alternatively, the term 'Kallar' can mean \\"Master\\" or \\"Landlord\\", Other proposed etymological origins include \\"black skinned\\", \\"hero\\", and \\"toddy- tappers\\". The anthropologist Susan Bayly notes that the name Kallar, as with that of Maravar, was a title bestowed by Tamil palaiyakkarars (warrior-chiefs) on pastoral peasants who acted as their armed retainers. The majority of those poligars, who during the late 17th- and 18th-centuries controlled much of the Telugu region as well as the Tamil area, had themselves come from the Kallar, Maravar and Vatuka communities. Kallar is synonymous with the western Indian term, Koli, having connotations of thievery but also of upland pastoralism. According to Bayly, Kallar should be considered a \\"title of rural groups in Tamil Nadu with warrior-pastoralist ancestral traditions\\". History Ramachandra Tondaiman, Raja of Pudukkottai seated in his palace, 1858 Bayly notes that the Kallar and Maravar identities as a caste, rather than as a title, \\"... were clearly not ancient facts of life in the Tamil Nadu region. Insofar as these people of the turbulent poligar country really did become castes, their bonds of affinity were shaped in the relatively recent past\\". Prior to the late 18th-century, their exposure to Brahmanic Hinduism, the concept of varna and practices such as endogamy that define the Indian caste system was minimal. Thereafter, the evolution as a caste developed as a result of various influences, including increased interaction with other groups as a consequence of jungle clearances, state-building and ideological shifts. British sources often characterized the Kallars, and the related castes, as \\"soldiers out of work.\\" Many Kallars had been warriors as well as peasants for the last few centuries. Kallar chieftaincies, organized into networks of nadus, controlled the region north and west of Madurai. The Nayaks attempted to pacify or subjugate them by titling Kallar chieftains, with limited success. These nadus were well outside Nayaka control, and folk songs told of fields that could not be harvested and raids by Kallar parties, who were considered sovereign and independent, in Madurai city. This situation persisted past the downfall of the Nayakas and the advent of Yusuf Khan, until the mid 18th century. Starting in 1755, the British army engaged in several brutal, bloody campaigns against the Kallars of Melur, but decades later Kallar raiding parties still posed a significant threat. In 1801, they networked with palegars of Tamil and Telugu regions to spearhead a series of revolts against British control. By the late 18th century, the Kallars were working as kavalkarars, or watchmen, in hundreds of villages throughout southern Tamil Nadu, especially the region west of Madurai. These kavalkarars were given maniyam, rent-free land, to ensure they did their job correctly. These kaval maniyams were commonly held by palaiyakarars who used land, and shares of the crops, to maintain a small militia. A common allegation made by colonial officials was that these kavalkarars were \\"abusing\\" their position and exploiting the peasants whose livelihoods they were supposed to protect. Kallars were often also hired as mercenaries by palaiyakarars, who according to British sources, used them to loot villagers. In 1803, these rights were abolished by the East India Company and the militias were abolished. However, the kaval system was not abolished but placed under the supervision of the East India Company. Reforms in 1816 abolished the responsibility kavalkarars had towards compensation for damaged crops while keeping fees, which British sources claimed led to the kavalkarars charging exhorbitant fees. By the end of the 19th century, the watchmen formed a \\"shadow administration.\\" Although British claims that Kallar watchmen were operating a \\"protection racket\\" were exaggerated, the Kallar watchmen still had the power of violence over the cultivators who paid them. Around the beginning of the 20th century, the cultivators, of many communities, near Madurai staged an anti-Kallar movement against the community's authority. The reasons for the movement are complex: partly the abuse of authority shown by Kallar watchmen, partly agrarian distress, and part-personal feud. The agitations took the form of violence against the Kallars, including arson, and forcing them out of the villages. In 1918, the community was placed on the list of Criminal Tribes. The Thondaiman dynasty of the erstwhile Pudukkottai state hailed from the Kallar community. Culture Among the traditional customs of the Kallar noted by colonial officials was the use of the \\"collery stick\\" (), a bent throwing stick or \\"false boomerang\\" which could be thrown up to . Writing in 1957, Louis Dumont noted that despite the weapon's frequent mention in literature, it had disappeared amongst the Piramalai Kallar. Diet The Kallar were traditionally a non-vegetarian people, though a 1970s survey of Tamil Nadu indicated that 30% of Kallar surveyed, though non-vegetarian, refrained from eating fish after puberty. Meat, though present in the Kallar diet, was not frequently eaten but restricted to Saturday nights and festival days. Even so, this small amount of meat was sufficient to affect perceptions of Kallar social status. Martial arts The Kallars traditionally practised a Tamil martial art variously known as Adimurai, chinna adi and varna ati. In recent years, since 1958, these have been referred to as Southern-style Kalaripayattu, although they are distinct from the ancient martial art of Kalaripayattu itself that was historically the style found in Kerala.

Elisabeth Spiro Klossowski pursued her own artistic career under the name Baladine Klossowska; she preferred life in France and lived there through much of her later life. The Klossowskis were forced to leave France in 1914, at the start of World War I, due to their German passports. The couple separated permanently in 1917; Klossowska took her sons to Switzerland. They moved to Berlin in 1921 due to financial pressures.Edward Lucie-Smith, Lives of the Great Twentieth Century Artists, New York, Rizzoli, 1986; p. 299. Mother and sons returned to Paris in 1924, where the three lived a materially marginal existence, often dependent upon help from friends and relations. Klossowska met Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) in 1919. At the time, Rilke was emerging from a severe depression that had limited his writing to uncollected poems, and a large number of letters, for several years during and after World War I. The two had an intense but episodic romantic relationship that lasted until Rilke's death from leukemia in 1926. Klossowska helped Rilke establish his residence in Switzerland, and proved a stabilizing force - in spite of the intensity of their own relationship - during a period when Rilke sought stability above all. Her sons developed close relationships with Rilke, and Balthasar published his first book of watercolors about a lost cat, Mitsou, with text by Rilke. In 1922, Rilke had written in what he called \\"a savage creative storm\\" his two most important collections of poetry, the Duino Elegies and Sonnets to Orpheus, both published in 1923.

While the concept covers many commonplace criminal offenses, the term is used in particular to refer to a 1929 law directed against left-wing political dissidents who sought to violently overthrow the government.  Legal Term  In Greek criminal law, an idionymous crime (ŒπŒ¥ŒπœéŒΩœÖŒºŒø Œ≠Œ≥Œ∫ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±) is a crime the constituent acts of which are already covered by an existing definition in the Penal Code but which is nonetheless treated as a completely separate criminal offense due to the particularity of the circumstances involved. Idionymous crimes are distinguished from mitigating and aggravating factors that change the penalty for a crime without turning it into a different crime. Examples of idionymous crimes include assaulting a minor (a separate crime to assault), assisted suicide (a separate crime to homicide) and theft in desperate need (a separate crime to theft). The term can also refer to crimes the constituent acts of which are normally legal but which become criminal in particular circumstances, usually involving a connection to a different criminal act. These include intentional inebriation leading to an illegal act, participation in a quarrel resulting in violence and membership of a criminal organisation.  Idionymon of 1929  In common and historical discourse, the term 'idionymon' is used in particular to refer to the crime established by Law 4229 of 1929 (\\"concerning safety measures for the social establishment and protection of freedom\\"), introduced by the liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, which established a penalty of six months imprisonment for anyone \\"who attempts to apply ideas that have as an obvious target the violent overthrow of the current social system, or who acts in propagandizing their application\\". The law was directed against communists and anarchists and was used to enforce repression against the trade union movement. By the end of 1930, the law had been used to ban and dissolve most worker's organizations affiliated with the far-left. The idionymon was the first of a series of legal measures directed against the Communist Party of Greece, the calls to violent revolution of which were considered a growing threat by the Greek establishment in the inter-war years, culminating in the brutal persecution of communists and socialists by the Metaxas regime. The establishment of the idionymon resulted from the perceived need to defend the gains of the republican reforms of Venizelos' Liberal party against the growing threat of leftist insurrection. The Second Hellenic Republic was inherently unstable, and furthermore, by the late 1920s, the old political dualism between Venizelists and Royalists was beginning to be threatened by agitation in the emerging working class. The defeat of the Asia Minor Campaign in 1922, which resulted in the arrival of over 1.5 million refugees, mostly impoverished and living in atrocious conditions, resulted in the emergence, for the first time, of a large urban working class, to whom the radical/communist ideas of the Russian Revolution might appeal. Two of the leaders of the liberal opposition in Parliament, Alexandros Papanastasiou and Georgios Kafantaris, had expressed strong disagreement during the vote. It is notable that Eleftherios Venizelos rejected Papanastasiou's proposal to use the idionymon against fascists as well as communists, although it is perhaps understandable in light of the far- right's low political presence in Greece at the time (relative to socialists) and Venizelos' ongoing diplomatic rapprochement with Fascist Italy. Following the establishment of the dictatorial \\"4th of August Regime\\" in 1936, the idionymon was replaced by Emergency Law 117/1936 (\\"concerning measures to combat communism and the consequences thereof\\"), which allowed authorities to require people to sign declarations condemning communism, refusal to sign which would be taken as evidence of guilt, and added harsher penalties, including five-year jail terms and internal exile in Greece. These measures remained in effect until 1945, when they were superseded by the Treaty of Varkiza, which legalised the Communist Party and prohibited persecution of its members. Nonetheless, measures similar to the idionymon were re-introduced by the democratically elected post-war government through Emergency Law 509 of 1947, in the context of the Greek Civil War and remained in effect until their final repeal by Decree-Law 59 of September 1974, introduced by the transitional government following the end of the Regime of the Colonels.

At times Juanita will work with her mother Joyce, and her daughter Jessica \\"Jessa Rae\\" together beading for larger regalia projects. Artwork Fogarty creates traditional Plains clothing and accessories, such as purses, pipe bags, dolls, cradle boards, rifle scabbards, and knife cases ‚Äì all adorned with beadwork or porcupine quill embroidery. Her quillwork is labor-intensive. She gathers her own quills from freshly killed porcupines, then washes and dyes them. She uses both synthetic and natural dyes, such as bloodroot, blackberries, and wolf moss. Sorting the quills by color and size is the lengthiest step in the process. The quills are then softened in a bath of warm water, and Fogarty flattens them with her own teeth. She then appliqu√©s or wraps the quills to moose or deer hide to create intricate patterns. The designs of her artwork are both abstract and realistic and are based on nature, daily life, and the mythology of her tribes. She says that traditional designs of her tribe would, \\"reflect what the people saw, and what they had going on in their lives at the time ... maybe somebody in their family had gone to war or battle.\\" Fogarty has won best of class four times at the Santa Fe Indian Market. She also dances at powwows in regalia created by her family over the course of seven years. As of 2006, she lived in North San Juan, California. Her work is in various permanent museum collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, and more. In 2019, her piece Give Away Horses (created in collaboration with her mother and daughter) was included in the exhibition \\"Heart of Our People: Native Women Artists\\" at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

Although in 1930s Kohi Safi was said to be one of the 2nd most populous district of Parwan after Charakar, but during 1930s-1940s the region was depopulated due to Governments pressure to evacuation of area due to Saf's War on the King. Majority of its population were displaced or escaped further in the north away from borders of capital Kabul, few escaped to west in modern Herat and many into it India (After 1947 came to be Pakistan). The root of the conflict seems to be started due to King Amanuallah Khan's proposal of modernization, Safi and with few other Afghan tribes armed against the ruling family of Durrani. Although some annalists assume the other factor behind the conflict and rise of Safi was mainly due to Safi's not being of ruling Durrani tribe, but rather Shinwari. Although Majority of Shinwari's enjoyed presence of Durrani and many were often involved into Government compare to those of Ghilzai, however Safis are always known to have history of conflict with many ruling governments and empires. History and population The Kohi Safi district is mainly a mountain area, considered to be a small region of the greater Kohistan region. The name of the district was known to have been mentioned going back as far as the 15th century, it was Sikandar Lodi's personal physician Qulam Adam Mohammad Shahid Mirza mentioning that someone should be sent to Kabul in the land of Saphystan to bring Herbal medicine. Perhaps the Indian medician's Islamic name \\"Laooq Sapistan\\" derived its name from Saphystan of greater Kabul also known as Kabulistan. Kohi Safi along with most of Eastern regions of Parwan region which was part of greater Kohistan region was also well known during Moghal era as the Saphystan land of Safi. Although the modern Kohi Safi district is smaller both in size and population, but prior to Safi war it carried a much larger population. Rebuilding Prior to the rule of Mohammed Nadir Shah majority of Safi and including high class ruling tribal leaders used to settle in Kohi Safi, during the invasion of the Soviets, Kohi Safi was further depopulated, and many infrastructures were destroyed. During the Taliban, Kohi Safi along with Khan Tota was where the Taliban have concentrated their resources, both districts came under heavy bombing during the US air offensives in 2001. From 2001-2003 the roads from Kabul to Kohi-Safi were known to be heaven for robbers, gangsters, and anti-US militants, ever since 2004 with many elected members of Safi Clan in the government, many projects were proposed, to make Safi district the next Kardi- see of Kabul. Although major developments are on the way, so far major roads, clean water, and part-time electricity, has been provided to the people of Kohi Safi.

In 2015 alone, South Korean law enforcement received and investigated over 8000 reports of cyber defamation; over half of these cases involve League of Legends where players head to police stations as a retaliation after being verbally abused by teammates or opponents. There are even 'settlement fee hunters', where players enter games and grief with intention of being insulted by other players. In some cases, such settlement fee hunters file police reports against over 50 other individuals at once. Most of the victims of settlement fee hunters are teenagers, since many parents are willing to pay settlement fees ranging from 300 thousand to 2 million KRW (300 to 2000 USD) to avoid their children having to go to trial and risk gaining criminal records.

The work does not include specific instrumentation, although the composer calls for three groups of wood and/or skins and three groups of metal instruments.Xenakis, I. (1975). Psappha, (p. 1) The actual printed performance score is written in a unique graph notation and consists of 2,396 segments. It presents a greater demand on the performer due to this unique style. Together with Rebonds, composed between 1987 and 1989, Psappha is one of the two compositions for solo percussion by Xenakis. Background \\"Psappha\\" is an archaic form of \\"Sappho\\", a great Greek poet from the Island of Lesbos, born in the 6th century BC. Her style was sensual and melodic, and she was one of the first poets to write from the first person, describing love and loss as it affected her personally. The target of her affections was most commonly female, and today both her name and place of residence have become synonymous with woman- love. Written for six groups of instruments, three of wood and/or skins and three of metal, Psappha is sharp, brittle, and even violent at times. This intensely masculine work seems almost in contradiction to its title. The inspiration here, however, manifests not as aesthetic, but as structure. The work's rhythmic structures are derived from small rhythmic cells characteristic of Sappho's poetry. These rhythms pervade the entire work and make both local and large-scale appearances. Much of the specifics of instrument choice is left up to the performer: Xenakis writes, \\"timbre serves only to clarify the rhythmic structures,\\" suggesting the \\"words\\" of this poem are only a secondary color to the structures that contain them. Commission Psappha was commissioned by the English Bach Festival with financial assistance from the Gulbenkian Foundation and is dedicated to percussionist Sylvio Gualda. The work was premiered by the dedicatee at Round House, London, on 2 May 1976.Percussion Solo Literature. Thomas Siwe, editor. Champaign, Ill.: Media Press, c1995  Footnotes  References *Xenakis, I.

UB-11 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. UB-11 was a little under in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launched and commissioned as SM UB-11 in March 1915.\\"SM\\" stands for \\"Seiner Majest√§t\\" () and combined with the U for Unterseeboot would be translated as His Majesty's Submarine. UB-11s commanding officer at commissioning only remained in charge of the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more commanding officers assigned through the end of the war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. UB-11 was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, UB-11 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Stinnes in February 1920.  Design and construction  After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders.Miller, pp. 46‚Äì47.Karau, p. 48. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.A further refinement of the design‚Äîreplacing the torpedo tubes with mine chutes but changing little else‚Äîevolved into the Type UC I coastal minelaying submarine. See: Miller, p. 458. UB-11 was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines‚Äînumbered to ‚Äîordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.Williamson, p. 12. UB-11 was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 7 November. As built, UB-11 was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single K√∂rting 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, UB-11 was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds. UB-11 was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. UB-11s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.Karau, p. 49. After work on UB-11 was complete at the Weser yard, she was launched on 2 March.  Career  The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-11 on 4 March 1915 under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant (Kapt.) , a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander.Wenninger was in the Navy's April 1907 cadet class with 34 other future U-boat captains, including Werner F√ºrbringer, Heino von Heimburg, Hans Howaldt, and Otto Steinbrinck. See: Wenninger was only in command of UB-11 for a week. Sources do not indicate who, if anyone, succeeded him as commander of UB-11, or if UB-11 remained in commission. According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, UB-11 had been assigned to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 63. Uboat.net reports that UB-11' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which may indicate that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel. At the end of the war, the Allies required all German U-boats to be sailed to Harwich for surrender. UB-11 was one of eight U-boats deemed unseaworthy and allowed to remain in Germany.Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 331‚Äì32.The other seven boats were , , , , and three fellow Type UB I boats, , , and .

PTWF strives to eliminate the use of religion as a tool to achieve personal agendas and to cause conflicts. Through inter-religious projects and concrete gestures of good will, PTWF identifies and eliminates obstacles between people of faith. PTWF utilizes an earned level of trust in order to \\"pave the way\\" towards improving inter-religious relations and encouraging intra-religious exchanges. PTWF tasks the faithful of all beliefs to recognize that the true danger to international peace is the extremist ideologies that exist within every faith. The Work In September 2000, in recognition of donating over 20 years of consulting services and negotiating the acquisition of medical equipment resulting in millions of dollars in savings to Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital in San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy, Gary Krupp was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II, only the seventh Jew to be so honored. Mr. Krupp also assisted the Hospital in 2006 by facilitating a sale of MRI equipment to the hospital by General Electric. Receiving the honor from the Pope inspired Krupp, a developer of medical facilities from Long Beach (NY), to follow the example of his fellow Jewish Knight Commanders in dedicating himself to the work of reconciliation between the Catholic and Jewish religions, In 2002 he founded the Pave the Way Foundation. The Foundation promotes the philosophy, \\"Embrace the Similarities - Savor the Differences\\", through cultural exchanges, talks, pilgrimages, and youth projects. PTWF has developed a Palestinian-Israeli Prosperity Plan that is designed to help provide meaningful jobs and thereby reduce one of the fundamental factors that contributes to hostilities and violence. In an effort to bring people closer together, it has coordinated the purchase of baby formula and diapers by Americans for impoverished families in the Holy Land, but the purchases are made by and for people of different faiths (e.g., Jewish Americans buying for Palestinians). Similarly, PTWF has provided blankets to Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem. PTWF also developed a manual of etiquette to help to train Israeli security personnel in response to Christian criticisms. PTWF has commended Islamic clerics who condemn violence in the name of their religion, explaining that such statements are important \\"in bringing an end to the chain of violent events that now endanger every human being on the planet.\\" PTWF also calls upon all world religions to speak out against violence and deaths perpetrated in the name of their religion and shun any persons who pervert the name of their religion to support violent and destructive goals. The Foundation also works to foster a strong partnership between the Vatican and the State of Israel. Krupp has lobbied the Israeli government to address the concerns of the Vatican on matters including the legal status of Catholic entities in Israel, issue of visa for Church employees and access of pilgrims to major shrines. PTWF has done considerable research on the papacy of Pius XII and has sought to deconstruct negative stereotypes such as \\"Hitler's Pope\\". In his Pius XII related work, Krupp has criticized historians who let down the general public by failing to do proper research. Krupp, while not an historian himself, has \\"sponsor[ed] a three-day symposium in Rome and publish[ed] four editions of a glossy, illustrated volume of evidence supporting his view that Pius XII spared no effort to save the lives of persecuted Jews.\\" It arranged the digitizing of the manuscripts of the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land for permanent archiving and protection. It negotiated the acquisition of high tech medical equipment for Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza the hospital of St. Padre Pio in Italy. It sponsored the exhibit \\"Pope John Paul II and the Jewish People - A Blessing to One Another\\" in New York City. It is also working to help bring peace to the Middle East promoting the Wasatia Forum. Krupp and the Foundation have played a role in diplomatic/political mediation between the Vatican and the State of Israel. When Israeli representatives withdrew from negotiations between the Catholic Church and Israel over proposed legislation relating to the Fundamental Agreement of 1993, Krupp acted as lead mediator between the two sides. Pave the Way lobbied Israeli diplomats, Jewish philanthropic organizations, Jewish congress-members and influential Jewish leaders to contact the Israeli Prime Minister's office and emphasize the importance of cementing the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Israeli state. The Israelis resumed negotiations. Another instance where the Foundation's intervention in Church-Israeli State affairs was important was after the election of a new Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilus III. The newly elected Patriarch was unable to discharge his duties when the Israel Government delayed recognition, Pave the Way Foundation, acting \\"in the interest of inter-religious harmony and positive, improved relations,\\" made representations to the Prime Minister of Israel and the King of Jordan, urging them to give the problem their attention. Theophilos III acknowledged the role of Krupp's intervention in helping move the Patriarchate's affairs forward. Pave the Way is a not-for-profit, tax exempt 501(c)3 organization. Pave the Way's 2012 Internal Revenue Service report states that Krupp and his wife were the organization's only two employees, with Gary Krupp earning $100,022, and his wife $36,667. Pave the Way is largely funded by twenty two members of the Board of Directors and contributions for special projects. During 2013, income amounted to $589,787. Direct project expenses were the second highest expenditure after the wages paid to the Krupp's. Pave the Way Foundation has active volunteers who identify specific needs projects in 15 countries.\\" Vatican Loan of the Maimonides Manuscripts As a result of Gary Krupp's unique position as a Jewish man invested to both Catholic and Anglican Orders of Chivalry, he has been able to arrange for the mutual exchange of and access to, priceless historical artifacts and ancient documents of incalculable religious, theological and societal significance. This ongoing project began as an effort to open the Vatican Library for the study of the previously unavailable writings of the 12th century Rabbi, philosopher and physician Moses Maimonides. Revered by the Jewish, Christian and Muslim religions, the writings and message of reconciliation by Maimonides, born of understanding the similarities of the three faiths, highlight the convergence of these faiths. The project has hence expanded to include much more. Phase one of the \\"Maimonides Project\\" came to fruition September 2002. Pave the Way Foundation requested and was granted permission to bring Jewish scholars to view the original manuscripts of Maimonides at the Vatican Library. The Library was especially opened for this occasion by Fr. Raffaele Farina SBD, Prefect of the Library and H.Em. Jorge Cardinal Mejia, Vatican Librarian and Archivist. Pave the Way initiated the Vatican loan of Maimonides‚Äô works, along with other rare Hebrew manuscripts, for exhibit in Jerusalem, at the Israel Museum's 40th anniversary, September 27, 2005. This historic commemoration was the first time in history that these manuscripts were on Israeli soil, and provided a rare opportunity for the scholarly study of these materials. As a public venue, the exhibition greatly increased the exposure, to a modern audience, of an ancient philosophy of reconciliation and tolerance between religions put forth by this widely revered luminary. Mission of Gratitude to the Vatican to Meet Pope John Paul II On January 18, 2005 168 Jewish leaders, the largest Jewish audience in history, met with Pope John Paul II to thank the Pontiff for all he had done for the Jewish people. Three Rabbis blessed the Pope, Cantors sang, Gary Krupp delivered a message from the worldwide Jewish community and the Pope responded with a message for renewed peace among the religions of the world. It was later reported that the Pope himself considered this audience to be one of the most importance events in Judeo-Catholic relations to occur during his Pontificate. This historic audience received vast media coverage. Another historical event sponsored by Pave the Way during the Mission of Gratitude was the first Cantorial Concert ever held in the Great Synagogue of Rome, which enabled Christian and Jewish participants to experience Ashkenazi Cantorial music together as a congregation. Acquisition of the Bodmer Papyrus In 2006, Pave the Way was primarily responsible for the acquisition of the Bodmer Papyrus for the Vatican Library, which is one of the most important Christian manuscripts in existence today. The Foundation facilitated a private sale of the papyri of the Gospels of St. John and St. Luke from the Bibliotheca Bodmeriana in Cologny, Switzerland. PTWF then identified the donor, Mr. Frank Hanna III, who in turn donated them to the Vatican Library. Bodmer XIV and XV contain the oldest written version of the Gospels and the oldest written version of the Lord's Prayer. Bodmer Papyrus XIV & XV were written between 175 and 225 AD, and were held as part of a private collection by the Bodmer Library since their discovery in 1952 at Pabau, Egypt. They were presented to Pope Benedict XVI on January 18, 2007. Covenants of Protection PTWF has been working diligently to focus awareness of the world community on the existence of ancient Covenants of Protection. \\"This is a message signed with the hand print of the founder of Islam, the Prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah in 628 CE, as a covenant to those who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them. No one of the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world).\\" The above quote is a partial translation of the document by Dr. Muqtedar Khan. The imprinted Covenant of Protection was written in 628 CE, as a guarantee of protection for the Christians of the Monastery of St. Catherine, at the base of Mount Sinai, which has remained safe under Muslim watch for 1,400 years. The breadth of the document in its entirety is stunning. It basically protects the right to property, freedom of religion, freedom of work, and security of person. There are no strings attached, and nothing is expected in return for such security. The simple act of being a Christian guarantees this protection. Collaborating with noted scholars of Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies, Pave the Way Foundation takes an active role in disseminating information, providing education and lectures to communities who might otherwise not have access to materials beyond their local resources. Halki Seminary In 1971, the Turkish government closed the Halki seminary (Heybeliada), the oldest and most important religious education institution in the Christian Orthodox Church, creating a grave crisis. This followed earlier Turkish Government decrees affecting the Patriarchate, including a requirement that the Patriarch must be a Turkish citizen and that the Turkish Government can veto the election of a new Patriarch. Previous Turkish Governments had objected to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople exercising his rights as the spiritual leader of more than 300 million Christian Orthodox faithful (the second largest Christian denomination in the world), tried to restrict him to the leadership for only the tiny Orthodox community in Turkey and confiscated Church properties in Turkey. This was a reversal of several centuries of much greater tolerance. Although Turkey is an Islamic country, the government closed all Muslim schools as well in an effort to secularize the school system. As the only Christian Orthodox seminary in Turkey, Halki Seminary was closed as collateral damage. May 2012, Pave the Way Foundation sent 5 letters to the Turkish government containing a Muslim request for Halki's reopening, together with its religious justification. The request was based on a covenant of protection for the \\"people of the book\\" (that is, Jews and Christians) guaranteed by the hand-printed signature of the Prophet Muhammad in 628 AD. The Prophet Muhammed, through his covenant, guarantees Islamic protection of the Christians and their churches from all of his followers until the end of time.

MS. N.p The letters were received by the Prime Minister, the President, the Ambassadors to the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union May, 2012. On July 5, 2012, Professor Mehmet Gormez, the highest Muslim authority in Turkey, made an unprecedented historic visit to Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew I. On that day he embraced the Patriarch and called for the reopening of the Halki seminary in the name of Islam and stated: Praise for Pius XII related activities Pave the Way's historical work regarding Pope Pius XII has been recognized for serving the common good by Archbishop Fernando Filoni, Substitute Vatican Secretary of State. One of Pave the Way Foundation's most important projects was helping the Vatican digitize and post its Actes et Documents collection of World War II documents on the Internet so that scholars from all over the world could review them.Jerusalem Post, February 15, 2010. PTWF has also posted over 76,000 pages of primary documents, interview videos, and contemporary reports on its web page, making primary sources available at no cost to researchers from around the world. Many organizations, which have used this controversy for fund raising purposes have attacked PTWF for its attempt to make original material available for scholars to reach an educated conclusion. In September 2008, PTWF sponsored an international conference on Pope Pius XII in Rome. Eighty participants, including Jewish and Christian clergy, historians, journalists, and authors ‚Äì took part. Pope Benedict XVI addressed the group and paid tribute to \\"the tireless pastoral and humanitarian work of Pius XII, Pastor Angelicus.\\" The New York Times reported that \\"several historians called to ask him to cancel his three-day conference in Rome, which ultimately drew many Vatican-friendly scholars but few with independent credentials\\". One Catholic historian, Paul O‚ÄôShea, tried to warn Krupp that proponents of canonization might be trying to use him. He urged Mr. Krupp to wait for the Vatican to open its files, and for scholars to complete their work, before reaching conclusions. Rabbi Eric Silver of Temple Beth David in Cheshire, Connecticut, who took part in the event, said: \\"We studied the documents in the Vatican‚Äôs archives and had eye- witness interviews, and what we learned was truly world-shaking. There is nobody who did more to rescue Jews than Pius.\\"Jewish Ledger, November 2008. Later, many of the presentations and numerous documents were compiled in book format. Among the scholars and researchers who have collaborated with Pave the Way are the late Sir Martin Gilbert, one of the leading Jewish historians of his generation; History Professor √âdouard Husson, Vice Chancellor of the University of Paris ‚Äì La Sorbonne; Israeli History Professor Limore Yagil, Tel Aviv University, advisor to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington DC, Associate researcher in the University of Paris ‚Äì La Sorbonne, author of several books on the Vatican efforts to save the Jews of France.

Dr. Frank P. Oliveri, founder of Courage Italia: Italian Resistance to the Holocaust Community Project and recipient of the Phi Delta Kappa Leadership Award in Holocaust Research. holds a PhD in history from Harvard University and La Sapienza University in Rome, wrote the following: \\"Having engaged in serious Holocaust research for the last 35 years, though my research has focused almost purely on individuals who sheltered, protected and in fact saved countless Jewish lives, after having reviewed Gary Krupp's compilation of documents in defense of Pope Pius XII, (Eugenio Pacelli), in two words, I have found his book astonishing and overwhelming. It is those very documents in Mr. Krupp's book that actually linked it all as it has never done before, by all historians and researcher put together, including this writer. Gary Krupp's work and passion has done more to bring Christians and Jews closer together, in an atmosphere of collaboration, greater understanding and brotherhood, than has ever happened during the long history of these two jealous sisters, Judaism and Christianity. It is now up to all of us to, more than ever before, recognize, pay tribute and honor more of those who in the face of evil, demonstrated Goodness, in the face of barbarism, demonstrated Humanity, and in the face of cowardice, demonstrated exceptional Courage.\\". Dr. Oliveri also stated, \\"That it is regrettable, the critics of the Pius XII documents project have resorted to personal attacks against Mr. Krupp, rather than register to actually come on to the site and examine the vast treasure trove of primary source information. Pope Benedict XVI has offered his thanks \\"to the Pave the Way Foundation for its ongoing activity in promoting relationships and dialogue between religions, as witnesses of peace, charity and reconciliation.\\" Rabbi Carlos C. Huerta, Chaplain (Major) United States Military Academy at West Point said of PTWF: \\"without organizations like yours our world would be far worse than it is and religious intolerance would be so rampant. I only pray that G-d gives you the strength to continue this important work.\\" H.E. Ambassador Alon Pinkas, former Consul General to New York for the State of Israel, has called Gary Krupp \\"a committed individual with a kind heart [who] has utilized his unique position within the Catholic Church and commitment to his own heritage, Judaism, as a springboard for dialogue between the two faiths.\\" Ambassador Oded Ben-Hur-Israeli Ambassador to the Holy See Rome called Krupp \\"a soldier of peace.\\" Criticism of Pius XII related activities Although the methodology of Pave the Way Foundation relating to the historical record of Pope Pius XII has been subject to harsh criticism from scholars and long-established Jewish organizations, the foundations is merely assembling primary source documents, eyewitness interviews and published works on its website for scholarly study. To date over 76,000 pages of documentation has been posted on its website. Professor Dwork, Rose Professor of Holocaust History and Director of the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University, said Mr. Krupp's research was \\"amateurish, worse than amateurish ‚Äî risible.\\" and that \\"He may be well-meaning, but his lack of experience in international affairs and historical research makes Mr. Krupp highly vulnerable to being manipulated by factions inside the Vatican. John T. Pawlikowski, Catholic priest and founding member of the board of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and Professor Emeritus of Social Ethics at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, said the Vatican was \\"discrediting itself by associating itself with this kind of questionable scholarship.\\" Eric Greenberg, director of Interfaith Policy at the New York-based Anti-Defamation League asserted \\"Whether he [Gary Krupp] understands it or not, he is waging a campaign of misinformation...He's been given out-of-context documents and is coming to overblown conclusions about Pius XII's personal involvement and that is a disservice to historians and to the historical truth.\\" Rabbi Joseph Potasnik of the New York Board of Rabbis, who was once a supporter, resigned from the board of directors of Pave the Way and commented \\"Many of us are very troubled by the stance Mr. Krupp has taken...Thus far there's only been a superficial examination (of Pius XII). Given the seriousness of the subject, we need to be much more deliberate and have as much historical factual information.\\" Pave the Ways claims of finding new documents that exonerate Pius XII are by disputed John Pawlikowski, professor of ethics at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, who argues that Krupp's evidence has already been studied by experts and that \\"We know that Pius did some things that were good, but they tended to come rather late, they were mostly behind the scenes and were relatively minor gestures.\\" The Anti-Defamation League asked Holocaust historian Paul O'Shea to examine other material published by Pave the Way and ADL concluded that \\"materials presented by Pave the Way Foundation are part of a campaign of misinformation by some Pius apologists who use selective church documents and issue unsubstantiated conclusions about Pius XII. O'Shea commented on the claims made by Pave the Way \\"To use the Campagna files to suggest that Pope Pius XII was active in attempting to rescue Jews is to demand something that historical record cannot sustain,\\" In 2011, Pave the way published claims that a new document they had recently uncovered showed that Pius XII had been pressurised by the allies not to make a radio broadcast that would save the lives of Hungarian Jews. Eric J. Greenberg points out that, contrary to the claims made by Pave the Way, \\"the 1944 cable is an old, well-known document, and by itself does not make the case for Pope Pius\\" and that \\"You can‚Äôt distribute or release an out-of-context letter or document and make a global claim for it. This is an example of Pave the Way‚Äôs campaign of misinformation that makes a disservice to Catholic and Jewish scholars\\". O'Shea, of the Australian Institute of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, also asserts that \\"Pave the Way\\" are masters at creating a media flurry. \\"They are not trained historians. They believe that by creating a deluge of paper with information that is favorable to their perception of Pius XII, they can create a new reality about the wartime pope.\\". Gabriel Wilensky asserts that historian and accredited journalist Michael Hesemann presents \\"findings of documents in a misleading way\\" by implying that the Catholic Church had always been opposed to the Nazi Party and evidences this with reference to the Concordat signed by the Vatican and Nazi Germany in 1933.

The River forms a psychological boundary between the counties of Murang'a and Kiambu. The Thika River is a significant source of hydroelectric power in Kenya and provides most of the water supply for Nairobi, Kenya's capital and largest city. The name Thika originates either from the Kikuyu language or from the Maasai language. It may relate to the Kikuyu word guthika, which means to bury. It also resembles the Maasai word sika, which means to rub something away from an edge. Course The Thika River originates in the Aberdare Range. It flows to the Tana River, which empties into the Indian Ocean. A landmark along the river's course is Thika Falls, near the town of Thika. Thika Falls has a drop of about 25 meters in a wilderness area within walking distance of the Blue Post Hotel, which is one of the oldest hotels in Kenya. Ecology During the early twentieth century colonial big game hunters noted hippopotamus and crocodiles along the deeper sections of the river. Baboons and leopards inhabited the forest near Thika Falls. Antelopes and zebras lived in the open country upriver from the falls. Rhinoceros, lions, and hyenas also resided in the area. Most of the game today relocated either upriver to the Aberdares forest or downriver due to pressure from increased human settlement along the river. Water source Eighty percent of the water supply for Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, comes from the Thika River. Deforestation and overgrazing along the river's heavily populated course have caused soil erosion problems. Sediments have reduced river flow, reservoir size, and water quality. Water quality has also deteriorated due to pesticide runoff. Hydroelectricity The Thika is part of the Tana basin, which is the most extensively engineered of Kenya's major arid watersheds. Hydroelectric power from the Thika River supplies a significant portion of Kenya's electricity. The first proposal for exploiting the Thika River's hydroelectric potential was put forward shortly after World War I by Guglielmo Marconi as a means for supplying power for a planned radio communications station in Nairobi. Marconi's plan was not implemented, but in 1994 the Thika Dam was constructed with a resulting water reservoir of 70 million cubic meters. The Thika River also contributes to the Masinga Reservoir, which serves the Seven Forks Dams. Taken together, three-quarters of Kenya's electrical supply derives from these dams.

Born Ioseb Jughashvili in Gori, Georgia to a cobbler and a house cleaner, he grew up in the city and attended school there before moving to Tiflis (modern-day Tbilisi) to join the Tiflis Seminary. While a student at the seminary he embraced Marxism and became an avid follower of Vladimir Lenin, and left the seminary to become a revolutionary. After being marked by Russian secret police for his activities, he became a full-time revolutionary and outlaw. He became one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the Caucasus, organizing paramilitaries, spreading propaganda, raising money through bank robberies, and kidnappings and extortion. Stalin was captured and exiled to Siberia numerous times, but often escaped. He became one of Lenin's closest associates, which helped him rise to the heights of power after the Russian Revolution. In 1913 Stalin was exiled to Siberia for the final time, and remained in exile until the February Revolution of 1917 led to the overthrow of the Russian Empire. Childhood Childhood: 1878‚Äì1893 Stalin's birth registration from the church records of Gori. Stalin was born Ioseb Jughashvili on in the town of Gori, in what is today the country of Georgia. He was baptised on and christened Ioseb, and known by the diminutive \\"Soso\\" His parents were Ekaterine (Keke) and Besarion Jughashvili (Beso). He was their third child; the first two, Mikheil and Giorgi had died in infancy.The couple's first child, Mikheil, was born on 14 February 1875, but died two months later. A second son, Giorgi, was born on 24 December 1876 but succumbed to measles and died in June 1877. See , . Stalin's father, Besarion, was a shoemaker and owned a workshop that at one point employed as many as ten people, but which slid into ruin as Stalin grew up. Beso had specialised in producing traditional Georgian footwear and did not produce the European-style shoes that were becoming increasingly fashionable. This, combined with the deaths of his previous two infant sons, precipitated his decline into alcoholism. The family found themselves living in poverty. The couple had to leave their home and moved into nine different rented rooms over ten years. The house Stalin was born in, as seen in 2017. Besarion also became violent towards his family. To escape the abusive relationship, Keke took Stalin and moved into the house of a family friend, Father Christopher Charkviani. She worked as a house cleaner and launderer for several local families who were sympathetic to her plight. Keke was a strict but affectionate mother to Stalin. She was a devout Christian, and both she and her son regularly attended church services. In 1884, Stalin contracted smallpox, which left him with facial pock scars for the rest of his life. Charkviani's teenaged sons taught Stalin the Russian language. Keke was determined to send her son to school, something that none of the family had previously achieved. In late 1888, when Stalin was ten, he enrolled at the Gori Church School. This was normally reserved for the children of clergy, but Charkviani ensured that Stalin received a place by claiming that the boy was the son of a deacon. This may be the reason why‚Äîin 1934‚ÄîStalin claimed to have been the son of a priest. There were many local rumours that Beso was not Stalin's real father, which in later life Stalin himself encouraged. Stalin biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore nonetheless thought it likely that Beso was the father, in part due to the strong physical resemblance that they shared. Beso eventually attacked a policeman while drunk which resulted in the authorities ejecting him from Gori. He moved to Tiflis, where he worked at the Adelkhanov shoe factory. Although Keke was poor, she ensured that her son was well dressed when he went to school, likely through the financial support of family friends. As a child, Stalin exhibited a number of idiosyncrasies; when happy, he would for instance jump around on one leg while clicking his fingers and yelling aloud. He excelled academically, and also displayed talent in painting and drama classes. He began writing poetry, and was a fan of the work of Georgian nationalist writer Raphael Eristavi. He was also a choirboy, singing both in church and at local weddings. A childhood friend of Stalin's later recalled that he \\"was the best but also the naughtiest pupil\\" in the class. He and his friends formed a gang, and often fought with other local children. He caused mischief; in one incident, he ignited explosive cartridges in a shop, and in another he tied a pan to the tail of a woman's pet cat. When Stalin was twelve, he was seriously injured after having been hit by a phaeton. He was hospitalised in Tiflis for several months, and sustained a lifelong disability to his left arm. His father subsequently kidnapped him and enrolled him as an apprentice cobbler in the factory; this would be Stalin's only experience as a worker. According to Stalin's biographer Robert Service, this was Stalin's \\"first experience with capitalism\\", and it was \\"raw, harsh and dispiriting\\". Several priests from Gori retrieved the boy, after which Beso cut all contact with his wife and son. In February 1892, Stalin's school teachers took him and the other pupils to witness the public hanging of several peasant bandits; Stalin and his friends sympathised with the condemned. The event left a deep and lasting impression on him. Stalin had decided that he wanted to become a local administrator so that he could deal with the problems of poverty that affected the population around Gori. Despite his Christian upbringing, he had become an atheist after contemplating the problem of evil and learning about evolution through Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Tiflis Seminary: 1893‚Äì1899 Tiflis Orthodox Theological Seminary (c 1919) In July 1893, Stalin passed his exams and his teachers recommended him to the Tiflis Seminary. Keke took him to the city, where they rented a room. Stalin applied for a scholarship to enable him to attend the school; they accepted him as a half-boarder, meaning that he was required to pay a reduced fee of 40 roubles a year. This was still a substantial sum for his mother, and he was likely financially assisted once more by family friends. He officially enrolled at the school in August 1894. Here he joined 600 trainee priests, who boarded in dormitories containing between twenty and thirty beds. Stalin was set apart by being three years older than most of the other first year students, although a number of his fellow students had also attended the Gori Church School. At Tiflis, Stalin was again an academically successful pupil, gaining high grades in his subjects. Among the subjects taught at the seminary were Russian literature; secular history; mathematics; Latin; Greek; Church Slavonic singing; Georgian Imeretian singing; and Holy Scripture. As students progressed they were taught more concentrated theological subjects such as ecclesiastical history; liturgy; homiletics; comparative theology; moral theology; practical pastoral work; didactics; and church singing. To earn money, he sang in a choir, with his father sometimes asking him for his earnings. During the holidays he would return to Gori to spend time with his mother. Tiflis was a multi-ethnic city in which Georgians were a minority. The Seminary was controlled by the Georgian Orthodox Church, which was part of the Russian Orthodox Church and subordinate to the ecclesiastical authorities in St. Petersburg. The priests employed to work there were largely reactionary, anti-semitic, Russian nationalists. They banned the speaking of Georgian by pupils, insisting that Russian be used at all times. Stalin was however proud to be Georgian. He continued writing poetry, and took several of his poems to the office of the newspaper Iveria (\\"Georgia\\"). There, they were read by Ilia Chavchavadze, who liked them and ensured that five were published in the newspaper. Each was published under the pseudonym of \\"Soselo\\". Thematically, they dealt with topics like nature, land, and patriotism. According to Montefiore, they became \\"minor Georgian classics\\", and were included in various anthologies of Georgian poetry over the coming years. Montefiore was of the view that \\"their romantic imagery was derivative but their beauty lay in the delicacy and purity of rhythm and language\\". Similarly, Service felt that in the original Georgian language these poems had \\"a linguistic purity recognised by all\\". Stalin came under the influence of Karl Marx. Over his years at the Seminary, Stalin lost interest in many of his studies and his grades began to drop. He grew his hair long in an act of rebellion against the school's rules. Seminary records contain complaints that he declared himself an atheist, chatted in class, was late for meals, and refused to doff his hat to monks. He was repeatedly confined to a cell for his rebellious behaviour. He had joined a forbidden book club, the Cheap Library, which was active at the school. Among the authors whom he read in this period were √âmile Zola, Nikolay Nekrasov, Nikolai Gogol, Anton Chekhov, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Saltykov- Shchedrin, Friedrich Schiller, Guy de Maupassant, Honor√© de Balzac, and William Makepeace Thackeray. Particularly influential was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 pro-revolutionary novel What Is To Be Done?. Another influential text was Alexander Kazbegi's The Patricide, with Stalin adopting the nickname \\"Koba\\" from that of the book's bandit protagonist. These works of fiction were supplemented with the writings of Plato and books on Russian and French history. He also read Capital, the 1867 book by German sociological theorist Karl Marx, and tried learning German so that he could read the works of Marx and his collaborator Friedrich Engels in the language in which they were originally written. He had soon devoted himself to Marxism, the socio- political theory that Marx and Engels had developed. Marxism provided him with a new way of interpreting the world. The ideology was on the rise in Georgia, one of various forms of socialism then developing in opposition to the governing Tsarist authorities. At night, he attended secret meetings of local workers, most of whom were Russian. He was introduced to Silibistro \\"Silva\\" Jibladze, the Marxist founder of Mesame Dasi ('Third Group'), a Georgian socialist group. One of his poems was published in the group's newspaper, Kvali. Stalin found many socialists active in the Russian Empire to be too moderate, but was attracted by the writings of a Marxist who used the pseudonym of \\"Tulin\\"; this was Vladimir Lenin. It is also possible that he had pursued romantic and sexual relationships with women in Tiflis. Years later, there was some suggestion that he might have fathered a girl named Praskovia \\"Pasha\\" Mikhailovskaya around this period. In April 1899, Stalin left the seminary at the end of term and never returned, although the school encouraged him to come back. Through his years of attendance, he had received a classical education but had not qualified as a priest. In later years, he sought to glamourize his leaving, claiming that he had been expelled from the seminary for his revolutionary activities. Early revolutionary activity: 1899‚Äì1902 Stalin next worked as a tutor for middle class children, but earned a meager living. In October 1899, Stalin began work as a meteorologist at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, where his school-friend Vano Ketskhoveli was already employed. In this position, he worked during the night for a wage of twenty roubles a month. The position entailed little work, and allowed him to read while on duty. According to Robert Service, this was Stalin's \\"only period of sustained employment until after the October Revolution\\". In the early weeks of 1900, Stalin was arrested and held in Metekhi Fortress. The official explanation given was that Beso had not paid his taxes and that Stalin was responsible for ensuring that they were paid, although it may be that this was a \\"cryptic warning\\" from the police, who were aware of Stalin's Marxist revolutionary activities. As soon as she learned of the arrest, Keke came to Tiflis, while some of Stalin's wealthier friends helped to pay the taxes and get him out of prison. Stalin had attracted a group of radical young men around him, giving classes in socialist theory in a flat on Sololaki Street. Stalin was involved in organising a secret nocturnal mass meeting for May Day 1900, in which around 500 workers met in the hills outside the city. There, Stalin gave his first major public speech, in which he called for strike action, something that the Mesame Dasi opposed. Following his prompting, the workers at the railway depos and Adelkhanov's show factory went on strike. By this point, the Tsarist secret police‚Äîthe Okhrana‚Äîwere aware of Stalin's activities within Tiflis' revolutionary milieu. On the night of 21‚Äì22 March 1901, the Okhrana arrested a number of Marxist leaders in the city. Stalin himself escaped arrest; he was traveling toward the observatory aboard a tram when he recognised plain-clothes police around the building. He decided to remain on the tram and get off at a later stop. He did not return to the observatory, and henceforth lived off of donations given by political sympathisers and friends. Stalin next helped plan a large May Day demonstration for 1901, in which 3000 workers and leftists marched from Soldiers Bazaar to Yerevan Square. Demonstrators clashed with Cossack troops, resulting in 14 protesters being seriously wounded and 50 arrested. After this event, Stalin escaped several further attempts to arrest him. To evade detection, he slept in at least six different apartments and used the alias of \\"David\\". Soon after, one of Stalin's associates, Stepan Shaumian, organised the assassination of the railway boss director who resisted the strikers. In November 1901, Stalin attended a meeting of the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, where he was elected one of the eight Committee members. The Committee then sent Stalin to the port city of Batumi, where he arrived in November 1901. He identified an Okhrana infiltrator who was trying to gain access to the Batumi Marxist circles, and they were subsequently killed. According to Montefiore, this was \\"probably [Stalin's] first murder\\". In Batumi, Stalin moved around different flats, and it is likely that he had a relationship with Natasha Kirtava, whom he stayed with in Barskhana. Stalin's rhetoric proved divisive among the city's Marxists. His Batumi supporters became known as \\"Sosoists\\" while he was criticised by those regarded as \\"legals\\". Some of the \\"legals\\" suspected that Stalin might be an agent provocateur sent by the Tsarist authorities to infiltrate and discredit the movement. In Batumi, Stalin gained employment at Rothschild refinery storehouse. On 4 January 1902, the warehouse where he worked was set alight. The company's workers helped to put out the blaze, and insisted that they be paid a bonus for doing so. When the company refused, Stalin called a strike. He encouraged revolutionary fervour among workers through a number of leaflets that he had printed in both Georgian and Armenian. On 17 February, the Rothschild company agreed to the strikers' demands, which included a 30% pay rise. On 23 February, they then dismissed 389 workers whom they regarded as troublemakers. In response to this latter act, Stalin called for another strike. Many of the strike leaders were arrested by police. Stalin helped to organise a public demonstration outside the prison which was joined by much of the town. The demonstrators stormed the prison in an attempt to free the imprisoned strike leaders, but were fired upon by Cossack troops. 13 protesters were killed and 54 wounded. Stalin escaped with a wounded man. This event, known as the Batumi Massacre, gained national attention. Stalin then helped to organise a further demonstration for 12 March, the day on which the dead were buried. Around 7000 people took part in the march, which was heavily policed. By this point, the Okhrana had become aware of Stalin's significant role in the demonstrations. On 5 April, they arrested him at the house of one of his fellow revolutionaries. Imprisonment: 1902‚Äì1904 Stalin was initially interred in Batumi Prison. He soon established himself as a powerful and respected figure within the prison, and retained contacts with the outside world. On two occasions his mother visited him. The state prosecutor subsequently ruled that there was insufficient evidence for Stalin being behind the Batumi disturbances, but he was instead indicted for his involvement in revolutionary activities in Tiflis. In April 1903, Stalin led a prison protest against the visit of the Exarch of the Georgian Church. As punishment, he was restricted to solitary confinement before being moved to the stricter Kutaisi Prison. There, he gave lectures and encouraged inmates to read revolutionary literature. He organised a protest to ensure that many of those imprisoned for political activities were housed together. Stalin was exiled to Novaya Uda in Irkutsk province, eastern Siberia In July 1903, the Justice Minister recommended that Stalin be sentenced to three years of exile in eastern Siberia. Stalin began his journey east in October, when he boarded a prison steamship at Batumi harbour and travelled via Novorossiysk and Rostov to Irkutsk. He then travelled, by foot and coach, to Novaya Uda, arriving at the small settlement on 26 November. In the town, Stalin lived in the two-room house of a local peasant, sleeping in the building's larder. There were many other exiled leftist intellectuals in the town, the majority of whom were Jewish, but Stalin eschewed them and preferred drinking alcohol with the petty criminals that had been exiled there. While Stalin was in exile, a split had developed in the RDSLP, between the Bolsheviks who backed Lenin and the Mensheviks who backed Julius Martov. Stalin had several attempts to escape Novaya Uda. On the first attempt he made it to Balagansk, but suffered from frostbite to his face and was forced to return. On the second attempt, he escaped Siberia and returned to Tiflis. It was while he was in the city that the Russo-Japanese War broke out. In Tiflis, Stalin again lived in the homes of various friends, and also attended a Marxist circle led by Lev Kamenev. A number of local Marxists called for Stalin's expulsion from the RSDLP because of his calls for the establishment of a separate Georgian Marxist movement. They saw this as a betrayal of Marxist internationalism and compared it to the views of the Jewish Bundists. Some referred to him as the \\"Georgian Bundist\\". Stalin was defended by the first Georgian Marxist to officially declare himself a Bolshevik, Mikha Tskhakaya, although the latter made the young man publicly renounce his views. He aligned himself with the Bolsheviks, growing to detest many of the Georgian Mensheviks. Menshevism was however the dominant revolutionary force in the Southern Caucuses, leaving the Bolsheviks as a small minority. Stalin was able to establish a local Bolshevik stronghold in the mining town of Chiatura. At workers' meetings around Georgia, Stalin frequently debated against the Mensheviks. He called for an opposition to inter-ethnic violence, an alliance between the proletariat and peasantry, and‚Äîin contrast to the Mensheviks‚Äîinsisted that there could be no compromise with the middle-classes in the struggle to overthrow the Tsar. With Philip Makharadze, Stalin began editing a Georgian Marxist newspaper, Proletariatis Brdzola (\\"Proletarian Struggle\\"). He spent time in Batumi and Gori, before Tskhakaya sent him to Kutaisi to establish a Committee for the province of Imeretia and Mingrelia in July. On New Year's Eve 1904, Stalin led a gang of workers who disrupted a party being held by a bourgeois liberal group. The Revolution of 1905: 1905‚Äì1907 In January 1905, a massacre of protesters took place in St Petersburg that came to be known as Bloody Sunday. Unrest soon spread across the Russian Empire in what came to be known as the Revolution of 1905. Along with Poland, Georgia was one of the regions particularly affected. In February, Stalin was in Baku when a spate of ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris; at least 2,000 were killed. Stalin formed a Bolshevik Battle Squad which he ordered to try and keep the warring ethnic factions apart, also using the unrest to steal printing equipment. He proceeded to Tiflis, where he organised a demonstration of ethnic reconciliation. Amid the growing violence, Stalin formed his own armed Red Battle Squads, with the Mensheviks doing the same. These armed revolutionary groups disarmed local police and troops, and gained further weaponry by raiding government arsenals. They raised funds through a protection racket on large local businesses and mines. Stalin's militia launched attacks on the government's Cossack troops and Black Hundreds. After Cossacks opened fire on a student meeting, killing sixty of those assembled, Stalin retaliated in September by launching nine simultaneous attacks on the Cossacks. In October, Stalin's militia agreed to co-operate many of its attacks with the local Menshevik militia. On 26 November 1905, the Georgian Bolsheviks elected Stalin and two others as their delegates to a Bolshevik conference due to be held in St. Petersburg. Using the alias of \\"Ivanovitch\\", Stalin set off by train in early December, and on arrival met with Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, who informed them that the venue had been moved to Tammerfors in the Grand Duchy of Finland. It was at the conference that Stalin met Lenin for the first time. Although Stalin held Lenin in deep respect, he was vocal in his disagreement with Lenin's view that the Bolsheviks should field candidates for the forthcoming election to the State Duma. In Stalin's absence, General Fyodor Griiazanov had crushed the Tiflis rebels. Stalin's Battle Squads had to go into hiding and operate from the underground. When Stalin returned to the city, he co-organised the assassination of Griiazanov with local Mensheviks. Stalin also established a small group which he called the Bolshevik Expropriators Club, although it would more widely be known as the Group or Outfit. Containing about ten members, three of whom were women, the group procured arms, facilitated prison escapes, raided banks, and executed traitors. They utilised protection rackets to further finance their activities. During 1906, they carried out a series of bank robberies and hold- ups of stage coaches transporting money. The money collected was then divided; much of it was sent to Lenin while the rest was used to finance Proletariatis Brdzola. Stalin had continued to edit this newspaper, and also contributed articles to it using the pseudonyms \\"Koba\\" and \\"Besoshvili\\". In early April 1906, Stalin left Georgia to attend the RSDLP Fourth Congress in Stockholm. He travelled via St Petersburg and the Finnish port of Hang√∂. This would be the first time that he had left the Russian Empire. The ship on which Stalin travelled, the Oihonna, was shipwrecked; Stalin and the other passengers had to wait to be rescued. At the Congress, Stalin was one of 16 Georgians, but he was the only one who was a Bolshevik. There, the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks disagreed over the so-called \\"agrarian question\\". Both agreed that the land should be expropriated from the gentry, but whereas Lenin believed that it should be nationalised under state ownership, the Mensheviks called for it to be municipalised under the ownership of local districts. Stalin disagreed with both, arguing that peasants should be allowed to take control of the land themselves; in his view, this would strengthen the alliance between the peasantry and the proletariat. At the conference, the RSDLP‚Äîthen led by its Menshevik majority‚Äîagreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery. Lenin and Stalin disagreed with this decision. Stalin returned to Tiflis via Berlin, arriving home in June. Ekaterina \\"Kato\\" Svanidze, Jughashvili's first wife For some time, Stalin had been living in a central Tiflis apartment owned by the Alliluyev family. He and one of the members of this family, Kato Svanidze, gradually developed a romantic connection. They married in July 1906; despite his atheism, he agreed to her wish for a church wedding. The ceremony took place in a church at Tskhakaya on the night of 15‚Äì16 July. In September, Stalin then attended an RSDLP conference in Tiflis; of the 42 delegates, only 6 were Bolshevik, with Stalin openly expressing his contempt of the Mensheviks. On 20 September, his gang boarded the Tsarevich Giorgi steamship as it passed Cape Kodori and stole the money aboard. Stalin was possibly among those who carried out this operation. Svanidze was subsequently arrested for her revolutionary connections, and shortly after her release‚Äîon 18 March 1907‚Äîshe gave birth to Stalin's son, Yakov. Stalin nicknamed his new- born son \\"Patsana\\". By 1907‚Äîaccording to Robert Service‚ÄîStalin had established himself as \\"Georgia's leading Bolshevik\\". Stalin travelled to the Fifth RSDLP Congress, held in London in May‚ÄìJune 1907, via St Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. While in Denmark, he made a detour to Berlin for a secret meeting with Lenin to discuss the robberies. Stalin arrived in England and Harwich and took the train to London. There, he rented a room in Stepney, part of the city's East End that housed a substantial Jewish √©migr√© community from the Russian Empire. The congress took place at a church in Islington. He remained in London for about three weeks, helping to nurse Tskhahaya after the latter fell ill. He returned to Tiflis via Paris. Tiflis Robbery: 1907‚Äì09 After returning to Tiflis, Stalin organized the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank on 26 June 1907. His gang ambushed the armed convoy in Yerevan Square with gunfire and homemade bombs. Around 40 people were killed, but all of Jughashvili's gang managed to escape alive. It is possible that Stalin hired a number of Socialist Revolutionaries to help him in the heist. Around 250,000 roubles were stolen. Service described it as \\"their greatest coup\\". After the heist, Stalin took his wife and son away from Tiflis, settling in Baku. There, Mensheviks confronted Stalin about the robbery but he denied any involvement. These Mensheviks then voted to expel him from the RSDLP, but Stalin took no notice of them. In Baku, he moved his family into a seafront house just outside the city. There, he edited two Bolshevik newspapers, Bakinsky Proletary and Gudok (\\"Whistle\\"). In August 1907, he travelled to Germany to attend the Seventh Congress of the Second International, which took place in Stuttgart. He had returned to Baku in September, where the city was undergoing another spate of ethnic violence. In the city, he helped to secure Bolshevik domination of the local RSDLP branch. While devoting himself to revolutionary activity, Stalin had been neglecting his wife and child. Kato fell ill with typhus, and so he took her back to Tiflis to be with her family. There, she died in his arms on 22 November 1907. Fearing that he would commit suicide, Stalin's friends confiscated his revolver. The funeral took place on 25 November at Kulubanskaya Church before her body was buried at St Nina's Church in Kukia. During the funeral, Stalin threw himself onto the coffin in grief; he then had to escape the churchyard when he saw Okhrana members approaching. He then left his son with his late wife's family in Tiflis. Stalin was exiled to the village of Solvychegodsk There, Stalin reassembled the Outfit and began publicly calling for more workers' strikes. The Outfit continued to attack Black Hundreds, and raised finances by running protection rackets, counterfeiting currency, and carrying out robberies. One of the robberies carried out in this period was of a ship, the Nicholas I, as it docked in Baku harbour. Not long after, the Outfit carried out a raid on Baku's naval arsenal, during which several guards were killed. They also kidnapped the children of several wealthy figures in order to extract ransom money. He also co-operated with Hummat, the Muslim Bolshevik group, and was involved in assisting the arming of the Persian Revolution against Shah Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar. At some point in 1908 he travelled to the Swiss city of Geneva to meet with Lenin; he also met the Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov, who exasperated him. On 25 March 1908, Stalin was arrested in a police raid and interred in Bailov Prison. In prison, he studied Esperanto, then regarding it as the language of the future. Leading the Bolsheviks imprisoned there, he organised discussion groups and had those suspected of being police spies killed. He planned an escape attempt but it was later cancelled. He was eventually sentenced to two years exile in the village of Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province. The journey there took three months, over the course of which he contracted typhus, and spent time in both Moscow's Butyrki Prison and Vologda Prison. He finally arrived at the village in February 1909. There, he stayed with in a communal house with nine fellow exiles. There, he repeatedly got into trouble with the local police chief; the latter locked Stalin up for reading revolutionary literature aloud and fined him for attending the theatre. While in village, Stalin had an affair with an Odessan noblewoman and teacher, Stefania Petrovskaya. In June, Stalin escaped the village and made it to Kotlas disguised as a woman. From there, he made it to St Petersburg, where he was hidden by supporters. Launching Pravda: 1909‚Äì12 The information card on \\"I. V. Stalin\\", from the files of the Imperial police in Saint Petersburg, 1911 By July 1909, Stalin was back in Baku. There he began to express the need for the Bolsheviks to help boost their ailing fortunes by re-uniting with the Mensheviks. He was increasingly frustrated with Lenin's factionalist attitudes. In October 1909, Stalin was arrested alongside several fellow Bolsheviks, but bribed the police officers into letting them escape. He was arrested again on 23 March 1910, this time with Petrovskaya. He was sentenced into internal exile and sent back to Solvychegodsk, being banned from returning to the southern Caucuses for five years. He had gained permission to marry Petrovskaya in the prison church, but he was deported on the same day‚Äî23 September 1910‚Äîthat he received permission to do so. He would never see her again. In Solvychegodsk, he commenced a relationship with a teacher, Serafima Khoroshenina, and before February 1911 had registered as her cohabiting partner; she however was soon exiled to Nikolsk. He then entered into an affair with his landlady, Maria Kuzakova, with whom he fathered a son, Konstantin. He also spent time reading and planting pine trees. During his exile, he had an affair Stalin was given permission to leave Solvychehodsk in June 1911. From there, he was required to stay in Vologda for two months, where he spent much of his time in the local library. There, he also had a relationship with the sixteen-year old Pelageya Onufrieva, who was already in an established relationship with the Bolshevik Peter Chizhikov. He then proceeded to St Petersburg, On 9 September 1911 he was again arrested, and held prisoner by the Okhrana for three weeks. He was then exiled to Vologda for three years. He was permitted to travel there on his own, but on the way hid from the authorities in St Petersburg for a while. He had been hoped to attend a Prague Conference that Lenin was organising but did not have the funds. He then returned to Vologda, living in a house owned by a divorcee; it is likely that he had an affair with her. At the Prague Conference, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was established; Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev subsequently proposed co-opting the absent Stalin onto the group. Lenin believed that Stalin would be useful in helping to secure support for the Bolsheviks from the Empire's minority ethnicities. According to Conquest, Lenin recognised Stalin as \\"a ruthless and dependable enforcer of the Bolsheviks' will\\". Stalin was then appointed to the Central Committee, and would remain on it for the rest of his life. On 29 February, Stalin then took the train to St Petersburg via Moscow. There, his assigned task was to convert the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (\\"Star\\") into a daily, Pravda (\\"Truth\\"). The new newspaper was launched in April 1912. Stalin served as its editor-in-chief, but did so secretly. He was assisted in the newspaper's production by Vyacheslav Scriabin. In the city, he stayed in the flat of Tatiana Slavatinskaya, with whom he had an affair. The Outfit's last heist and the national question: 1912‚Äì13 By May 1912, he was back in Tiflis. He then returned to St Petersburg via Moscow, and stayed with N. G. Poletaev, the Bolsheviks' Duma deputy. During that same month Stalin was arrested again and imprisoned in the Shpalerhy Prison; in July he was sentenced to three years exile in Siberia. On 12 July, he arrived in Tomsk, from which he took a steamship on the Ob River to Kolpashevo, from which he travelled to Narym, where he was required to remain. There, he shared a room with the fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov. After only two months, Stalin escaped via canoe and made it to Tomsk by September. There he waited for Sverdlov to follow him, and the two proceeded to St Petersburg, where they were hidden by supporters. Stalin returned to Tiflis, where the Outfit planned their last big action. They attempted to ambush a mail coach, but were unsuccessful; after fleeing, eighteen of their members were apprehended and arrested. Stalin returned to St Petersburg, where he continued editing and writing articles for Pravda, moving from apartment to apartment. After the Duma elections of October 1912 resulted in six Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks being elected, Stalin began calling for reconciliation between the two Marxist factions in Pravda. Lenin criticised him for this opinion, with Stalin declining to publish forty-seven of the articles which Lenin sent to him. With Valentina Lobova, he travelled to Krakow, a culturally Polish part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to meet with Lenin. They continued to disagree on the issue of reunification with the Mensheviks. Stalin left and returned to St Petersburg but at Lenin's request he made a second trip to Krakow in December. Stalin and Lenin bonded on this latter visit, with the former eventually bowing to Lenin's views on reunification with the Mensheviks. On this trip, Stalin also made friends with Roman Malinovsky, a Bolshevik who was secretly an informer for the Okhrana. In January 1913, Stalin travelled to Vienna, where he stayed with the wealthy Bolshevik sympathiser Alexander Troyanovsky. He was in the city at the same time as Adolf Hitler and Josip Broz Tito, although he likely did not meet either of them at the time. There, he devoted himself to examining the 'national question' of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the various national and ethnic minorities living in the Russian Empire. Lenin had wanted to attract these minorities to the Bolshevik cause and to offer them the right of succession from the Russian state; at the same time, he hoped that they would not take up this offer and would want to remain part of a future Bolshevik-governed Russia. Stalin had not been able to read German, but had been assisted in studying German texts by writers like Karl Kautsky and Otto Bauer by fellow Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin. He finished the article, which was titled Marxism and the National Question. Lenin was very happy with it, and in a private letter to Maxim Gorky he referred to Stalin as the \\"wonderful Georgian\\". According to Montefiore, this was \\"Stalin's most famous work\\". The article was published in March 1913 under the pseudonym of \\"K. Stalin\\", a name he had been using since 1912. This name derived from the Russian language word for steel (stal), and has been translated as \\"Man of Steel\\". It was‚Äîaccording to Service‚Äîan \\"unmistakably Russian name\\". Montefiore suggested that Stalin stuck with this name for the rest of his life because it had been used on the article which established his reputation within the Bolshevik movement. Final exile: 1913‚Äì1917 Stalin in exile, 1915 In February 1913, Stalin was back in St. Petersburg. At the time, the Okhrana were cracking down on the Bolsheviks by arresting leading members. Stalin himself was arrested at a masquerade ball held by the Bolsheviks as a fundraiser at the Kalashnikov Exchange. Stalin was subsequently sentenced to four years exile in Turukhansk, a remote part of Siberia from which escape was particularly difficult. In August, he arrived in the village of Monastyrskoe, although after four weeks was relocated to the hamlet of Kostino. Stalin wrote letters to many people whom he knew, begging for them to send him money, in part to finance his escape attempt. The authorities were concerned about any escape attempt and thus moved Stalin, along with Sverdlov, to the hamlet of Kureika, on the edge of the Arctic Circle, in March 1914. There, the Bolshevik pair lived in the izba of the Taraseeva family, but frustrated one another as housemates. In the hamlet, Stalin had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygia, who subsequently fell pregnant with Stalin's child. Circa December 1914, Pereprygia gave birth to Stalin's child, although the infant died soon after. Near the end of summer 1914, the authorities moved Stalin to Selivanikha, where he was visited by his close friend Suren Spandarian. Here, he lived closely with the indigenous Tunguses and Ostyak communities, with whom he went on fishing trips. He spent lengthy periods on Polovinka island, where he constructed a one-man shelter and spent much time fishing in the adjacent Yenisei River. He also went on solitary hunting trips, tracking down Arctic foxes, partridges, and ducks. Stalin served as an informal doctor for the community and played with the local children. The locals gave Stalin a pet dog, which he named Stepan Timofeevich and nicknamed Tishka. Pereprygia had fallen pregnant for a second time, and would give birth to another of Stalin's children, a son named Alexander, circa April 1917, after Stalin had left Siberia. While Stalin was in exile, Russia had entered the First World War, but was faring poorly against the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires. The Russian government began conscripting exiles into the Russian Army. In October 1916, Stalin and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted, leaving for Monastyrkoe. In December they set forth from there to Krasnoyarsk, arriving in February 1917. There, a medical examiner ruled him unfit for military service due to his crippled arm. This was convenient for Stalin as it meant that he would not be sent to fight on the Eastern Front, but also remained a source of embarrassment for him. Stalin was required to serve four more months on his exile, and he successfully requested that he be allowed to serve it in nearby Achinsk. There, he stayed in the apartment of fellow Bolshevik Vera Shveitzer. Between the February and October Revolutions Stalin was in Achinsk when the February Revolution took place; uprisings broke out in Petrograd‚Äîas St Petersburg had been renamed‚Äîand the Tsar abdicated, to be replaced by a Provisional Government. In March, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd with Kamenev. There, Stalin and Kamenev expressed the view that they were willing to temporarily back the new administration and accept the continuation of Russian involvement in the First World War so long as it was purely defensive. This was in contrast to the view of Lenin‚Äîwho was still in a self-imposed exile in Europe‚Äîthat the Bolsheviks should oppose the Provisional Government and support an end to the war. On 15 March, Stalin and Kamenev assumed control of Pravda, removing Vyacheslav Molotov from that position. Stalin was also appointed as the Bolshevik representative to the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. Lenin then returned to Russia, with Stalin meeting him on his arrival at Petrograd's Finland Station. In conversation, Lenin convinced Stalin to adopt his view on the Provisional Government and the ongoing war. On 29 April, Stalin came third in the Bolshevik elections for the party's Central Committee; Lenin came first and Zinoviev came second. This reflected his senior standing in the party at the time. Over the coming months he spent much of his time working on Pravda, at the Petrograd Soviet, or assisting Lenin on the Central Committee. He lived with Molotov in an apartment on Shirokaya Street; he and Molotov became friends. Stalin was involved in planning an armed demonstration of the Bolsheviks' supporters. Although not explicitly encouraging those armed supporters who carried out the July Days uprising, he partially did so by informing its leaders that \\"you comrades know best\\". After the armed demonstration was suppressed, the Provisional Government initiated a crackdown on the Bolsheviks, raiding Pravda. During this raid, Stalin smuggled Lenin out of the newspaper's office and subsequently took charge of the Bolshevik leader's safety, moving him to five safe houses over the course of three days. Stalin then oversaw the smuggling of Lenin out of Petrograd to Razliv. He himself left the flat that he shared with Molotov and moved in with the Alliluyeva family. In Lenin's absence, he continued editing Pravda and served as acting leader of the Bolsheviks, overseeing the party's Sixth Congress, which was held covertly. At the Congress, Stalin was selected as the chief editor of all Bolshevik press and was appointed a member of the constituent assembly. Lenin began calling for the Bolsheviks to seize power by toppling the Provisional Government in a coup. Stalin and Trotsky both endorsed Lenin's plan of action, but it was opposed by Kamenev and other Bolsheviks. Lenin returned to Petrograd and at a meeting of the Central Committee on 10 October, he secured a majority in favour of a coup. Kamenev nevertheless disagreed and wrote a letter warning against insurrection that Stalin agreed to publish in Rabochii Put. Trotsky censured Stalin for publishing it, with the latter responding with offering his resignation, which was not accepted. On 24 October, police raided the Bolshevik newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses; Stalin managed to salvage some of this equipment in order to continue his activities. In the early hours of 25 October, Stalin joined Lenin in a Central Committee meeting in the Smolny Institute, from where the Bolshevik coup‚Äîthe October Revolution‚Äîwas being directed. Armed Bolshevik militia had seized Petrograd's electric power station, main post office, state bank, telephone exchange, and several bridges. A Bolshevik-controlled ship, the Aurora, sailed up to the Winter Palace, and opened fire, with the assembled delegates of the Provisional Government surrendering and being arrested by the Bolsheviks. Name and aliases Stalin's birth name in Georgian was Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili (). An ethnic Georgian, he also a subject of the Russian Empire, so also had a Russified version of his name: Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili (). Stalin's surname () is transliterated as according to the official romanization system of the Georgian government. An alternative transliteration is , per the ISO standard (9984:1996). His name was Russified to \\"\\", which is in turn transliterated into English as and . Besarionis dze means \\"son of Besarion,\\" and was Russified to Vissarionovich (\\"son of Vissarion\\", the Russian version of \\"Besarion\\"). There are several etymologies of the () root. In one version, the name derives from the village of Jugaani in Kakhetia, eastern Georgia.–ü—Ä–µ–¥–∫–∏ –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞ In Georgian, the suffix means \\"child\\" or \\"son\\". Neo- Nazi and other anti-Semitic sources have claimed that \\"Dzhuga\\" or \\"Jugha\\" means \\"Jew\\" in Georgian and hence \\"Dzhugashvili\\" literally means \\"Jew-son\\" or son of a Jew. This is incorrect as the word for \\"Jew\\" in Georgian is (). An article in the newspaper Pravda in 1988 claimed the word derives from the Old Georgian for \\"steel\\" which might be the reason for his adoption of the name Stalin. (\\"\\") is derived from combining the Russian (\\"\\"), \\"steel\\", with the possessive suffix (\\"\\"), a formula used by many other Bolsheviks, including Lenin. The surname \\"Jughashvili\\" could possibly be of non-Georgian origin since the various peoples of the Caucasus region had moved around for centuries.Robert Service, Stalin: A Biography, p. 18 Throughout his life, Stalin often heard rumours that his paternal grandfather was ethnically Ossetian. However, like many other parts of Stalin's early life, his ancestry is often mixed up with facts and rumours.Helen Rappaport, Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion, p. 71 According to theories advanced by Mihail Vayskopf,\\"–ò–ú–Ø –°–¢–ê–õ–ò–ù\\" it is the Ossetian for \\"herd of sheep\\"; the surname \\"Jugayev\\" is common among Ossetians, and before the revolution names in South Ossetia were traditionally written with the Georgian suffix, especially among Christianized Ossetians. Allusions to the hypothesis of Ossetian ethnicity of Stalin are present in the important Stalin Epigram by Osip Mandelstam: Like many outlaws, Stalin used many aliases throughout his revolutionary career, of which \\"Stalin\\" was only the last. During his education in Tiflis, he picked up the nickname \\"Koba\\", after the Robin Hood-like protagonist from the 1883 novel The Patricide by Alexander Kazbegi. This became his favorite nickname throughout his revolutionary life. Stalin continued to use Koba as his Party name in the underground world of the RSDLP. During conversations, Lenin called Stalin \\"Koba\\". Among his friends he was sometimes known by his childhood nickname \\"Soso\\" ‚Äì a Georgian diminutive form of the name Ioseb. Stalin is also reported to have used at least a dozen other nicknames, pseudonyms and aliases such as \\"Josef Besoshvili\\"; \\"Ivanov\\"; \\"A. Ivanovich\\"; \\"Soselo\\" (a youthful nickname), \\"K. Kato\\"; \\"G. Nizheradze\\"; \\"Chizhikov\\" or \\"Chizhnikov\\"; \\"Petrov\\"; \\"Vissarionovich\\"; \\"Vassilyi\\". Directly following World War II, as the Soviets were negotiating with the Allies, Stalin often sent directions to Molotov as \\"Druzhkov\\". Rumours of being an Okhranka agent Stalin's apparent ease in escaping from Tsarist persecution and very light sentences led to rumours that he was an Okhranka agent. His efforts in 1909 to root out traitors caused much strife within the party; some accused him of doing this deliberately on the orders of the Okhranka. The Menshevik Razhden Arsenidze accused Stalin of betraying comrades he did not like to the Okhranka. The prominent Bolshevik Stepan Shaumyan directly accused Stalin of being an Okhrana agent in 1916. According to his personal secretary Olga Shatunovskaya, these opinions were shared by Stanislav Kosior, Iona Yakir and other prominent Bolsheviks. The rumours were reinforced by being published in the Soviet Union memoirs of Domenty Vadachkory, who wrote that Stalin used an Okhranka badge (supposedly stolen) to help him escape exile.–ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ç –û—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∫–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∫–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –ø–æ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é? by Sergey Zemlyanoy Nezavisimaya Gazeta 3 July 2002 It also appears suspicious that Stalin played down the number of his escapes from prisons and exiles.–¢–∞–π–Ω—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∞–±–µ–∂–∏ –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –∫—Ä—ã—à–µ–≤–∞–ª –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω Komsomolskaya Pravda 13 November 2008–°–¢–ê–õ–ò–ù - –ê–ì–ï–ù–¢ –û–•–†–ê–ù–ö–ò: –ó–ê –ò –ü–†–û–¢–ò–í by A. Ostrovsky Still there was no hard evidence of Stalin's collaboration with the Okhranka and a few alleged reports from Stalin to the Okhranka published by the media appear to be forgeries. Historian Simon Sebag Montefiore found that in all surviving Okhranka records Stalin is described as a revolutionary and never as a spy. Montefiore argued that Stalin escaped from his exiles so frequently because the exile system was not secure: an exile only needed money and false papers to escape the village where he was settled, and thousands did. Stalin also had spies of his own in the Okhranka, warning him of their actions. In 1956, the magazine Life published the Eremin Letter, supposedly written by Colonel Ermin, head of the Tiflis Okhranka, which stated that Stalin was an agent, but it has since been shown to be a forgery. In his 1967 biography of Stalin, Edward Ellis Smith argued that Stalin was an Okhranka agent by citing his suspicious ability to escape from Okhranka dragnets, travel unimpeded, and rabble-rouse full-time with no apparent source of income. One such example was the raid that occurred on the night of 3 April 1901, when nearly everyone of importance in the Socialist-Democratic movement in Tiflis was arrested, except for Stalin, who was apparently \\"enjoying the balmy spring air, and in one of his to-hell-with-the-revolution moods, [which] is too impossible for serious consideration.\\"Smith, Edward Ellis.The Young Stalin. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1967. pg 77. Montefiore, however, wrote that Stalin spotted Okhranka agents waiting for him outside his place of employment whilst he was riding a tram; he stayed on the tram and immediately went into hiding. Service thought there \\"no serious grounds\\" for deeming Stalin an Okhrana agent. Similarly, Robert Conquest was of the view that such claims \\"must be dismissed\\". Stephen Kotkin wrote in his biography of Stalin that these claims simply aren't true and were never proven. References Notes Footnotes Bibliography  Category:Joseph Stalin Stalin, Joseph ","title":"Early life of Joseph Stalin"},{"id":"21618163","text":"The Norinco Type 80 is a close-combat machine pistol that was used in China in the 1980s by the People's Liberation Army of China. It was developed by Norinco in the 1970s, influenced by the design of the German M712 Schnellfeuer. The Type 80 can be used in either single-shot mode or fully automatic fire mode; however, the chamber overheats after ten rounds of sustained automatic fire, risking accidental discharge.  History  The Type 80 was built in the late 1970s as a personal defense weapon for vehicle crews and other military personnel of the People's Liberation Army of China. It was accepted into service in 1980.  Construction  The Type 80 was created by refining and upgrading the design of the various Chinese copies of the imported German selective-fire M712 Schnellfeuer version of the Mauser C96 \\"Broomhandle\\" semi-automatic pistol that were produced and used in China in the 1930s. The internal design is derived from the basic Mauser action, with a slight recoil of the barrel enabling the locking piece under the lightweight bolt. This enables the bolt to drop out of engagement and borrows from the later Westinger (rather than the Nickl) selector mechanism. There is an obvious family resemblance outlined with the C96 having the magazine well in front of the trigger, slender barrel and exposed hammer. The pistol has a permanent unregulated sight set at a distance of 50 m (the maximum effective distance when firing in bursts) and the selector permitted either single shots or automatic fire. The cyclic rate is believed to be around 850 rounds per minute. When firing bursts it is expected that the holster/stock or alternative metal shoulder stock would be attached to the slot at the back of the grip. The pistol grip itself has a more ergonomic shape than the traditional Mauser C96's \\"Broomhandle\\". Another slight difference is the slight forward slope to the magazine which is intended to give greater reliability in feeding. The Type 80 was developed in the 1970s and introduced into service in 1980, it was intended to give service personnel such as tank crews an individual weapon compact enough to be carried as standard equipment. Whilst not having the range or power of an assault rifle, it would have been more accurate in carbine form than a simple pistol whilst also having the potential of automatic fire. During the 1930s, the Broomhandle pistols were highly prized in China, to the extent of becoming a status symbol.

Such policies have been developing most notably in colleges in the United States regarding alcohol use by students. Schools such as Cornell University have implemented such policies to protect students seeking medical attention from illegal action for underage drinking and possession of alcohol and/or other drugs. The purpose of such policies is to reduce the hesitation caused by fear of legal action to seek medical attention. Similar policies are applicable at many levels: Colleges and universities, local communities, as well as state governments. In 2012, The Medical Amnesty Initiative was started with the specific purpose of advocating for the introduction, passage, and education of Medical Amnesty legislation throughout the United States.http://www.medicalamnesty.org Development Medical amnesty policies were first present in the University setting. Although failure to seek medical assistance in cases of alcohol poisoning can lead to fatal outcomes, evidence suggests that the threat of judicial consequences resulting from enforcement of the minimum drinking age or other law or policy violations leads some students to refrain from calling for emergency medical services. A study was initiated in 2002 at Cornell University to investigate if implementation of a Medical amnesty policy increase the likelihood that students will call for help in alcohol-related medical emergencies; and increase the likelihood that students treated for alcohol-related medical emergencies will receive a brief psycho-educational intervention at the university health center as a follow-up to their medical treatment. In April 2009, more than 100 college and university presidents signed the Amethyst Initiative.Amethyst Initiative. The Amethyst Initiative seeks to spark discussion about the current drinking age, problems related to underage drinking, and to develop new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8097783&page;=1 One preventative component of this that many campuses have adopted is requiring an online alcohol education course before registering for classes. Another option to better handle underage drinking is the introduction of medical amnesty policies. Levels of protection Medical amnesty policies can extend legal protection to varying degrees. Individual amnesty Individual amnesty is the most limited level of protection. This level protects individuals who are seeking medical attention for themselves as a result of an illegal action. Individual amnesty does not extend to organizations that person may be a part of or peers also present with the individual at that time. Victim Amnesty Amnesty for victims offers more protection than individual amnesty, as it protects individuals requiring medical attention regardless of whether it was the victim or another party who sought help. Victim amnesty does not address the sanctions possible for violating parties besides the victim. Caller amnesty These policies, also known as Good Samaritan policies, protects individuals who call for another person seeking medical attention as a result of an illegal action. Liability protection in medical amnesty policies can often extend to those seeking help regardless if they are the one who is given medical assistance. This policy builds on individual amnesty but does not guarantee protection from legal prosecution for an organization the persons are a part of or attending. See also Good Samaritan law. Organizational amnesty Protects an organization that is related to the event at which medical attention is sought as a result of an illegal action. Organizational amnesty would extend liability protection to fraternities, sororities, clubs and other social venues that may have people at their location who are under the influence of certain intoxicants. This level of amnesty allows for the largest level of protection and is subsequently the most controversial as well. Various institutions provide medical amnesty to individuals and callers but do not extend amnesty to organizations that may be involved. Levels of implementation Colleges and Universities Many Colleges and Universities hold some level of a Medical amnesty policy. Medical amnesty at the university level most often pertains to exemption from punishment for an intoxicated or impaired underage student if medical assistance is called to help him or her in an emergency situation. Instead of a harsher penalty for underage drinking or drug use, a student usually receives some sort of counseling by a professional following an incident to help identify if the student has a more serious alcohol or drug problem and to provide the student with suggestions on how to stay safe in the future. Ultimately universities seek to encourage students to call for help, valuing the student's well being as the primary concern and forgoing punishment for the student's mistake, instead referring students involved to education, community service, and rehabilitation services. Richmond University compiled a list in February 2010 of colleges and universities that have a medical amnesty policy in place as of that time.CITATION NEEDED The organization, Students for Sensible Drug Policy,Students for a Sensible Drug Policy is an extremely strong advocate for expanding medical amnesty policies on college campuses. The organization provides a list of schools who currently have a medical amnesty policy and a description of what the policy includes as well as a brief description of the school.The research into participating schools is published on their website, Good Samaritan Policy Research : Schools with policies . States The specifics of Medical Amnesty Acts, or sometimes titled 911 Good Samaritan or 911 Lifeline, vary from state to state. The laws are also in varying stages of development and implementation. The following states have passed a Medical Amnesty law: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia. Washington, D.C. also provides Medical Amnesty protection. Several states also have a Medical Amnesty bill moving through the legislative process. Michigan‚Äôs Medical Amnesty Legislation, House Bill 4393,http://legislature.mi.gov/(S(qe3jqm554fbl2ljvqkqde5jo))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName;=2011-HB-4393 was signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder on May 8, 2012, and took effect on June 1, 2012. The bill was sponsored by Representative Anthony G. Forlini at the request of Steve Marino, Aaron Letzeiser, and the Associated Students of Michigan State University.http://statenews.com/index.php/article/2012/04/medical_amnesty_bill_passes_in_mich- _senate On January 4, 2017 the superseding Michigan House Bill 5649 of 2016, which was signed into law by Governor Snyder, became effective as Public Act 307 of 2016. http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2016-HB-5649 This superseding act expands Michigan's medical amnesty protection to any person, regardless of age, who requests medical assistance for someone who is suffering the effects of a drug or alcohol emergency, as well as anyone else who is with them. The person suffering from the medical emergency is also protected. The protection from prosecution only covers violations of Michigan's controlled substance and alcohol laws. They still may be prosecuted for non-drug or alcohol related offenses that may be discovered in the course of providing medical assistance. Federal No federal legislation has been introduced to date concerning medical amnesty. The Medical Amnesty Initiative Following the successful passage of Michigan's Medical Amnesty law, advocate Aaron Letzeiser created The Medical Amnesty Initiative; a non-profit organization dedicated to the introduction, passage, and education of Medical Amnesty legislation throughout the United States. Effectiveness Cornell University completed one of the most extensive studies on Medical Amnesty Policies to date. The study found that within two years of implementing a Medical Amnesty (MAP)/Good Samaritan Policy, ‚Äústudents were less likely to report fear of getting an intoxicated person in trouble as a barrier to calling for help. Furthermore, the percentage of students seen by health centre staff for a brief psycho- educational intervention after an alcohol-related emergency more than doubled (from 22% to 52%) by the end of the second year.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis finding, combined with the survey data indicating a slight decrease in students‚Äô barriers to calling for help, suggests that the increase in calls for help in an alcohol-related emergency was a function of the MAP and related educational efforts rather than changes in drinking practices.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile well-intended, policies and practices at institutions of higher education that are designed to enforce minimum legal drinking age laws and restrict other aspects of alcohol possession and consumption may have negative consequences. For example, such policies may actually deter some students from calling for emergency medical services in dangerous circumstances caused by heavy alcohol use (Colby, Raymond, & Colby, 2000). When alcohol is present, students may be reluctant to seek help in these emergencies because of potential judicial consequences for themselves, the person in need of assistance, or the hosting organization (Meilman, 1992).Often the decision whether to call for help happens late at night and becomes the responsibility of student bystanders whose judgment may be impaired because of their own alcohol consumption.‚Äù ‚ÄúResearch suggests that when individuals who are treated for alcohol-related emergencies receive, as part of their follow-up care after the emergency, a brief psycho-educational intervention examining their alcohol use, the likelihood of recurrence is reduced (Longabaughet al.,2001). At Cornell, students are unlikely to avail themselves of such services on a voluntary basis, even when they receive written requests to do so from the director of health services. In contrast, students who are required to participate in such education as a result of judicial action do so consistently. Since September 2001, the standard requirement for students with a first-time judicial violation has been participation in the Cornell BASICS (Brief Alcohol and Screening Intervention for College Students) program. The Cornell BASICS program was modeled on research that found a two-session screening and feedback process, with elements of motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral skills training, to be effective in reducing drinking and the harm associated with high-risk alcohol consumption in the college environment (Baer, Kivlahan, Blume, McKnight, & Marlatt, 2001; Barnett et al., 2004; Borsari & Carey, 2000; Dimeff, Baer, Kivlahan, & Marlatt, 1999; Marlatt et al., 1998).‚Äù \\"A random sample survey of Cornell undergraduates conducted in the spring of 2000 found that 19% of respondents reported thinking about calling for help because they were concerned about someone who was severely intoxicated, though only 4% actually called for help. The most frequently cited reason for not calling for help was that the respondent was not sure if the person was sick enough (9.3%). The next highest reason given was because the respondent did not want to get the distressed individual in trouble (3.8%).‚Äù Criticisms Many people have criticized medical amnesty policies as policies that perpetuate underage drinking. Critics note that the goal of ameliorating the issue of youth alcohol consumption and drug abuse should focus more on preventing such activities rather than simply providing a more open course of action once choices have been made. An alternative explanation could be that the increase in calls for help reflects an increase in heavy drinking among the student population resulting in a larger percentage of students in need of emergency assistance.

In the years following Lenin's death in 1924, he rose to become the authoritarian leader of the Soviet Union. After growing up in Georgia, Stalin conducted activities for the Bolshevik party for twelve years before the Russian Revolution of 1917. After being elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee in April 1917, Stalin helped Lenin to evade capture by authorities and ordered the besieged Bolsheviks to surrender to avoid a bloodbath. The Bolsheviks then seized Petrograd and Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs. In the civil war that followed between Lenin's Red Army against the White Army, Stalin formed alliances with Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny while leading troops in the Caucasus. There, he ordered the killings of former Tsarist officers and counter-revolutionaries. After their Civil War victory, the Bolsheviks moved to expand the revolution into Europe, starting with Poland, which was fighting the Red Army in Ukraine. As joint commander of an army in Ukraine, Stalin's actions in the war were later criticized, including by Leon Trotsky. Background Stalin was born on December 18, 1878 in Gori, Georgia to a family of limited financial means.Isaac Deutscher, Stalin: A Political Biography (Oxford University Press: New York, 1967) p. 2. He was the fourth child born to the family of Ekaterina Gheladze and Vissarion Djugashvili; the prior three children of the couple had died at an early age.Isaac Deutscher, Stalin: A Political Biography, p. 2. Stalin later became politically active and, during the Russian Revolution of 1905, organized and armed Bolshevik militias across Georgia, running protection rackets and waging guerrilla warfare. After meeting Lenin at a Bolshevik conference in 1906 and marrying Ekaterina Svanidze, with whom he had a son Yakov, Stalin temporarily resigned from the party over its ban on bank robberies. Embarking on an effort to organize Muslim Azeri and Persian partisans in the Caucasus, Stalin conducted protection rackets, ransom kidnappings, counterfeiting operations and robberies, until arrest and exile in 1908. Between 1908 and 1917, Stalin was arrested seven times and escaped five times, enjoying less than two years of liberty in the nine-year period.Helen Rappaport. Joseph Stalin: a biographical companion. 1999, page 330 Role during the Russian Revolution of 1917 Supporting revolution and saving Lenin In the wake of the February Revolution of 1917 (the first phase of the Russian Revolution of 1917), Stalin was released from exile. On March 25 he returned to Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) with just a typewriter and a wicker suitcase, wearing a suit he had on in 1913 when he was arrested. On March 28, together with Lev Kamenev and Matvei Muranov Stalin ousted Vyacheslav Molotov and Alexander Shlyapnikov as editors of Pravda, the official Bolshevik newspaper, while Lenin and much of the Bolshevik leadership were still in exile. Stalin and the new editorial board took a position in favor of the Provisional Government (Molotov and Shlyapnikov had wanted to overthrow it) and went to the extent of declining to publish Lenin's 'letters from afar' arguing for the provisional government to be overthrown. He described them as \\"Unsatisfactory...a sketch with no facts.\\" For a week from March 12, Stalin stopped writing articles, this may have been when he switched to Lenin's position. However, after Lenin prevailed at the April Party conference, Stalin and the rest of the Pravda staff came on board with Lenin's view and called for overthrowing the provisional government. At this April 1917 Party conference, Stalin was elected to the Bolshevik Central Committee with 97 votes in the party, the third highest after Zinoviev and Lenin. These three plus Kamenev formed the Central Committee's Bureau. Stalin would share a flat with Molotov where he apologised: \\"You were the nearest of all to Lenin in the initial stage in April.\\" On June 24, Stalin threatened to resign when Lenin turned against the idea of an armed demonstration when the Soviets refused to support it. It went ahead anyway on July 1 and was a Bolshevik triumph. In mid-July, armed mobs led by Bolshevik militants took to the streets of Petrograd, killing army officers and who were considered bourgeois civilians. Sailors from Kronstadt phoned Stalin asking if an armed uprising was feasible. He said: \\"Rifles? You comrades know best.\\" This was enough encouragement for them. They demanded the overthrow of the government, but neither the Bolshevik leadership nor the Petrograd Soviet was willing to take power, having been totally surprised by this unplanned revolt. After the disappointed mobs dispersed, Kerensky's government struck back at the Bolsheviks. Loyalist troops raided Pravda on July 18 and surrounded the Bolshevik headquarters. Stalin helped Lenin evade capture minutes before and, to avoid a bloodbath, ordered the besieged Bolsheviks in the Peter and Paul Fortress to surrender. Stalin put Lenin in five different hiding places, the last being the Alliluyev family apartment. Convinced Lenin would be killed if caught, Stalin persuaded him not to surrender and smuggled him to Finland. He shaved off Lenin's beard and moustache, took him to Primorsky station then to a shack north of Petrograd, then to a barn in Finland. In Lenin's absence, Stalin assumed leadership of the Bolsheviks. At the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik party, held secretly in Petrograd, Stalin gave the main report, was chosen to be the chief editor of the Party press and a member of the Constituent Assembly, and was re-elected to the Central Committee. The coup of General Lavr Kornilov, August 1917 In , Kerensky suspected his newly appointed Commander-in-Chief, General Lavr Kornilov, of planning a coup and dismissed him (). Believing that Kerensky had acted under Bolshevik pressure, Kornilov decided to march his troops on Petrograd. In desperation, Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help and released the Bolsheviks, who raised a small army to defend the capital. In the end, Kerensky convinced Kornilov's army to stand down and to disband without violence.  The October Revolution  The Bolsheviks now found themselves free, rearmed, swelling with new recruits and under Stalin's firm control, whilst Kerensky had few troops loyal to him in the capital. Lenin decided that the time for a coup had arrived. Kamenev and Zinoviev proposed a coalition with the Mensheviks, but Stalin and Trotsky backed Lenin's wish for an exclusively Bolshevik government. Lenin returned to Petrograd in October. On October 23, the Central Committee voted 10-2 in favor of an insurrection; Kamenev and Zinoviev voted in opposition. On the morning of Kerensky's troops raided Stalin's press headquarters and smashed his printing presses. While he worked to restore his presses, Stalin missed a Central Committee meeting where assignments for the coup were being issued. Stalin instead spent the afternoon briefing Bolshevik delegates and passing communications to and from Lenin, who was in hiding. Early the next day, Stalin went to the Smolny Institute from where he, Lenin and the rest of the Central Committee coordinated the coup. Kerensky left the capital to rally the Imperial troops at the German front. By , the Bolsheviks had \\"stormed\\" the Winter Palace and arrested most of the members of Kerensky's cabinet. Establishing government On 7 November (O.S. 26 October) 1917, Lenin officially proclaimed the existence of the new Bolshevik government, which became known as \\"Sovnarkom\\". Stalin was not yet well known to the Russian public, but was included on a list of new People's Commissars‚Äîeffectively government ministers‚Äîunder the name of \\"J. V. Djugashvili-Stalin\\". Stalin moved into the Smolny Institute, where Sovnarkom was then based. It was probably Lenin who had proposed Stalin for the position of People's Commissar of Nationalities, and while Stalin had initially turned down the post, he ultimately relented. He and Yakov Sverdlov were also tasked with ensuring that Petrograd was defended from Kerensky's Cossack forces which had rallied in the Pulkovo Heights. During the first few months of the new government, Lenin, Stalin, and Trotsky formed what the historian Simon Sebag Montefiore described as an \\"inseparable troika\\". Lenin recognised both Stalin and Trotsky as \\"men of action\\" who stood out in this regard from many of the other senior Bolsheviks. On 29 November, the Bolshevik Central Committee established a four-man Chetverka to lead the country; it consisted of Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov. On 7 December, Lenin's government formed the Cheka, a political police force. On 27 October, they banned opposition press. Stalin supported the use of terror from the beginning; in response to a message from Estonian Bolsheviks suggesting how they could deal with opponents, he stated that \\"the idea of a concentration camp is excellent\\". Role in the Russian Civil War, 1917‚Äì1919 Upon seizing Petrograd, the Bolsheviks formed the new revolutionary authority, the Council of People's Commissars. Stalin was appointed People's Commissar for Nationalities' Affairs; his job was to establish an institution to win over non-Russian citizens of the former Russian Empire. He was relieved of his post as editor of Pravda so that he could devote himself fully to his new role.Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography. 2004. In March 1918, the Menshevik leader Julius Martov published an article exposing Bolshevik crimes committed before the revolution. Martov wrote that Stalin had organized bank robberies and had been expelled from his own party for doing so (the latter part is untrue). Stalin sued Martov for libel and won. After seizing Petrograd, civil war broke out in Russia, pitting Lenin's Red Army against the White Army, a loose alliance of anti-Bolshevik forces. Lenin formed an eight-member Politburo which included Stalin and Trotsky. During this time, only Stalin and Trotsky were allowed to see Lenin without an appointment. In May 1918, Lenin dispatched Stalin to the city of Tsaritsyn (later known as Stalingrad, now Volgograd). Situated on the Lower Volga, it was a key supply route to the oil and grain of the North Caucasus. There was a critical shortage of food in Russia, and Stalin was assigned to procure any he could find according to Prodrazvyorstka policy. The city was also in danger of falling to the White Army. He opposed the ‚Äúmilitary specialists‚Äù‚Äî former Tsarist professional military officers‚Äî and formed the \\"Tsaritsyn group,\\" a loose group of like- minded Bolshevik military leaders and party members personally loyal to Stalin. In doing so, he first met and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, both of whom would become two of Stalin's key supporters in the military. Through his new allies, he imposed his influence on the military; in July Lenin granted his request for official control over military operations in the region to fight the Battle for Tsaritsyn. Stalin challenged many of the decisions of Trotsky, who at this time was Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and thus his military superior. He ordered the killings of many former Tsarist officers in the Red Army; Trotsky, in agreement with the Central Committee, had hired them for their expertise, but Stalin distrusted them, seizing documents which showed many were agents for the White Army.Ian Grey, Stalin: Man of History (New York: Doubleday & Co, 1979). This created friction between Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin even wrote to Lenin asking that Trotsky be relieved of his post. Stalin ordered the executions of any suspected counter-revolutionaries.Simon Sebag Montefiore. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, Knopf, 2004 (). In the countryside, he burned villages to intimidate the peasantry into submission and discourage bandit raids on food shipments. In May 1919, Stalin was dispatched to the Western Front, near Petrograd. To stem mass desertions and defections of Red Army soldiers, Stalin had deserters and renegades rounded up and publicly executed as traitors. Role in the Polish-Soviet War, 1919‚Äì1920 After the Bolsheviks turned the tide and were winning the civil war in late 1919, Lenin and many others wanted to expand the revolution westwards into Europe, starting with Poland, which was fighting the Red Army in Byelorussia and the Ukraine. Stalin, in Ukraine at the time, argued these ambitions were unrealistic but lost. He was briefly transferred to the Caucasus in February 1920, but managed to get transferred back to Ukraine in May where he accepted the position of the Comissar of the South-West Front (commander Alexander Yegorov).Stalin: The Man and His Era, Beacon Press, 1987, , Google Print, p.189 In late July 1920, Yegorov moved against the then-Polish city of Lw√≥w, which conflicted with the general strategy set by Lenin and Trotsky by drawing his troops further away from the forces advancing on Warsaw. In mid-August, the Commander-in-Chief Sergei Kamenev ordered the transfer of troops (1st Cavalry Army, commanded by Semyon Budyonny and Kliment Voroshilov) from Yegorov's forces to reinforce the attack on Warsaw led by Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Stalin refused to counter-sign the order because it did not have the requisite two signatures on it, a reasonable response. In the end, the battles for both Lw√≥w and Warsaw were lost, and Stalin's actions were held partly to blame. Richard Pipes suggested Lenin was more to blame, for ordering Soviet troops south to spread the revolution to Romania, and north to secure the Polish corridor for Germany (this would win over German nationalists). Both these diversions weakened the Soviet assault. Much blame must be laid on the overall commander, Kamenev, for permitting insubordination from both front commanders and conflicting and ever-changing strategic orders during the critical phase in the attack on Warsaw. Stalin returned to Moscow in August 1920, where he defended himself before the Politburo by attacking the whole campaign strategy. Although this tactic worked, he nonetheless resigned his military commission, something he had repeatedly threatened to do when he didn't get his way. At the Ninth Party Conference on September 22, Trotsky openly criticized Stalin's war record. Stalin was accused of insubordination, personal ambition, military incompetence and seeking to build his own reputation by victories on his own front at the expense of operations elsewhere. Neither he nor anybody else challenged these attacks; he only briefly reaffirmed his position that the war itself was a mistake, something which everybody agreed on by this point.

Pictured on left: Capsule on SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Center: Capsule, with service module, unpressurized cargo space, and launch vehicle adapter structure, underneath the Falcon 9 payload shroud. Upper right: Outline of the sphere-cone shape, with ISS Common Berthing Adapter at rear. Lower right: Internal components layout The S-550 capsule was intended to carry up to six people (normally 2 or 3) and significant internal and external cargo on resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Unlike the other COTS competitors, the S-550 capsule was explicitly a human-operated vehicle - while it had automated flight functions, it was intended to be flown with crews for any space station mission, using manned control for all rendezvous and dockings with ISS. Design The overall vehicle was design was for a -diameter ballistic capsule, weighing including payloads. The capsule was projected to weigh \\"wet\\" (with 2 crew and consumables, but not cargo), the service module \\"wet\\" including rocket propellants, and of internal cargo or passengers within the capsule. Additional mass in external unpressurized cargo could be obtained with increased launch vehicle capacity beyond or by trading off internal cargo for external cargo. = Capsule shape = The S-550 capsule is a sphere-cone type lifting ballistic space capsule, similar to the shape of the film capsule reentry modules in the Corona spy satellite, but much larger. The general shape was also used by COTS competitor T/Space's CXV capsule. The capsule design shape had a spherical nose section diameter of 0.8 of the base diameter and 10 degree conical half-angle (see Atmospheric reentry). = Capsule layout = The capsule consisted of two structures - an outer aeroshell, which supported the ablative heatshield (thermal protection system), and an inner pressurized cylinder containing the crew, systems, and cargo space. Most of the spacecraft systems were at the front of the cylinder, up against the front bulkhead. The crew were seated in one row near the rear bulkhead and access hatch, with 2 \\"crew\\" seats on the sides with flight controls on the rear bulkhead and one passenger in the middle. Cargo was carried in the middle of the capsule, at the capsule's center of gravity, to simplify loading effects on reentry angles and lift.  Descent and landing  The S-550 capsule was intended to descend under a parachute system and touch down on land, using an inert aluminum foam crush structure in the nose of the capsule to attenuate the roughly 7 meter per second touchdown velocity. The landing did not require any active controls or systems to operate safely. Emergency landings in the water were handled by capsule flotation systems.  Service module  The service module was intended to provide rocket thrusters to control spacecraft attitude and provide orbital maneuvering capability to rendezvous with the International Space Station and then reenter the Earth's atmosphere. It included some structure, propellant tanks, and rocket motor systems.

He served as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death in 1953. In the years following the death of Vladimir Lenin, he rose to become dictator of the Soviet Union, using a combination of manipulation and terror to destroy his opposition. After growing up in Georgia, Stalin became a political activist, conducting discreet activities for the Bolshevik Party for twelve years before the Russian Revolution in 1917. Following the October Revolution, Stalin took military positions in the Russian Civil War and the Polish-Soviet War. Stalin was one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the Caucasus and grew close to leader Vladimir Lenin, who saw him as a tough character, and a loyal follower capable of getting things done behind the scenes. Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia, adopting a hardline approach to opposition. Stalin's connections helped him to gain influential positions behind the scenes in the Soviet-Russian government. At the 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), leaders decided to expand the party's Central Committee. Due to this expansion, a secretariat became a necessity. Stalin was appointed the head of this new office on the 3rd of April 1922. From that date until his death, Stalin's formal title was General Secretary. The office grew with Stalin's aggressive assumption of power, not the other way around. After a brief disappointment of not being given a prestigious ministerial post, Stalin soon learned how to use his new office in order to gain advantages towards other key persons within the Communist Party. He prepared the agenda for the Politburo meetings, directing the course of meetings. As General Secretary, he appointed new local party leaders, establishing a patronage network of people loyal to him.Isaac Deutscher, Stalin - a Political Biography, 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish , pp 184-233 Only a few weeks after his appointment, Lenin was forced into semi- retirement because of a stroke. Lenin never fully recovered and died in January 1924. He spent most of his remaining life resting in a countryside Dacha. But he received messages and political visitors, and between the autumn of 1922 and spring of 1923, he resumed his party leadership in Moscow. As late as in October 1922, Lenin expressed his \\"unreserved support\\" for Stalin as General Secretary and for his work with a new constitution. (Adopted in December 1924, it shaped the Soviet Union.) But soon thereafter, and having learned that a number of matters related to brutality, abuse of power and rising internal party struggles had occurred during his absence, Lenin's faith in Stalin faded. Lenin was disturbed by a report on violent atrocities committed in Georgia, reported by the head of the security police GPU, Felix Dzerzhinsky. He attributed the atrocities to Sergo Ordzhonikidze and associated people. Neither did Lenin approve of Dzerzhinsky, who expressed his support of Stalin, whilst reporting on Georgia to Lenin.Harrison S.Salisbury,\\"Russia in Revolution 1900-1930\\", 1978, Swedish , p. 264 Further, Stalin had been very unpleasant with Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya on the telephone. Stalin had threatened to have her prosecuted for having disturbed Lenin with political matters during his recovery.Salisbury, p.266-269 (the book has numerous illustrations.) All of this caused a growing suspicion on Stalin. In December 1922 and early January 1923, Lenin dictated a political will. Historian Isaac Deutscher, who first published reports in 1949 of the terrorism conducted by Stalin, described Lenin's will by the following: \\"The whole testament breathed uncertainty\\". It contains some hard criticism on Stalin, but sharply criticizes Leon Trotsky; Lenin primarily expressed a fear of a future fragmentation of the party.Isaac Deutscher, 'Stalin - a Political Biography, 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish , pp 198-199 After Lenin's death, a struggle for power in the party broke out in the open. Stalin, through his office as General Secretary, took advantage of his knowledge of the existing antagonisms among the Bolshevik Party's leaders. Many were members of the Party's supreme organ, the Politburo, but rivalries extended beyond that. Several People's Commissars (or Ministers in other countries) were involved in the Party's internal personal as well as political struggles. Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev represented the intellectual \\"left wing,\\" whilst Nikolai Bukharin, Mikhail Tomsky and Alexei Rykov represented the trade unionist \\"right wing\\". But the most prominent Bolshevik after Lenin's death was Leon Trotsky, who led a group of his own. None of these persons would survive Stalin; all died of suspected assassinations.Isaac Deutscher, Stalin - a Political Biography, 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish , p 203 Soon after Lenin's death, Stalin joined Zinoviev and Kamenev in a Politburo Triumvirate. By 1924 they were united in wanting to get rid of the troublesome Trotsky. But this was no easy task. Trotsky had developed the Red Army and had played a huge role during the October Revolution. He was intellectually and as orator superior to Stalin. Stalin used Zinoviev and Kamenev to combat Trotsky, while appearing as \\"The Golden Centre Man\\". There are multiple theories on the hostility between Stalin and Trotsky, and when it began. But a huge political divider became Stalin's idea of \\"Socialism in One Country\\" vs Trotsky's \\"Permanent Revolution\\". Stalin's idea, in the mid-1920s, was actually revolutionary in itself. The entire Bolshevik concept had been to begin at home, in Russia, and then \\"export\\" the revolution to the West. By 1925 it had become apparent that all revolutionary movements in Germany and elsewhere had failed. In Italy even a counter-socialistic movement, Fascism, had come to power. From these perspectives, suddenly few Bolsheviks saw Stalin's idea as sound when compared to Trotsky's.Isaac Deutscher, \\"Stalin - a Political Biography\\", 2nd edition, 1961, Swedish , pp 233-249 Trotsky was first removed as Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs (January 1925), removed from the Politburo (October 1926), removed from the Central Committee (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), exiled to Alma‚ÄìAta in Kazakhstan (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). But Stalin had canceled the cooperation with Zinoviev and Kamenev a long time before Trotsky's final decline. He slowly but steadily desired to get rid of his two former Triumvirate-companions. During this phase, Stalin instead joined forces with the \\"right\\" of the Bolshevik Party. Together with Bukharin, Tomsky and Rykov, Stalin could now rather easily send Zinoviev and Kamenev to Gulag (thus far just briefly), and by 1929 also Bukharin, Tomsky and Rykov found themselves played by Stalin. All struggles for power were over. Stalin was now the autocratic ruler of the entire Soviet Union. Millions of Russians and people of other ethnic origin inside the Soviet Union had been killed during the Russian Civil War, through starvation and in other conflicts, but the bloodbath had thus far not reached within the Bolshevik Party. Background Before his 1913-1917 exile in Siberia, Stalin was one of the Bolshevik operatives in the Caucasus, organizing cells, spreading propaganda, and raising money through criminal activities. Stalin eventually earned a place in Lenin's inner circle and the highest echelons of the Bolshevik hierarchy. His pseudonym, Stalin, means \\"man of the steel hand\\". The October Revolution took place in the Russian capital of Petrograd on 7 November 1917 (O.S. 25 October 1917), which saw the transfer of all political power to the Soviets. In the Russian Civil War that followed, Stalin forged connections with various Red Army generals and eventually acquired military powers of his own. He brutally suppressed counter-revolutionaries and bandits. After winning the civil war, the Bolsheviks moved to expand the revolution into Europe, starting with Poland, which was fighting the Red Army in Ukraine. As joint commander of an army in Ukraine and later in Poland itself, Stalin's actions in the war were later criticized by many, including Leon Trotsky. Invasion of Georgia and General Secretary In late 1920, with the crises in society following the Russian Civil War, Trotsky argued for the trade unions to be incorporated more and more into the workers' state, and for the workers' state to completely control the industrial sectors. Lenin's position was one where the trade unions were subordinate to the workers' state, but separate, with Lenin accusing Trotsky of \\"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\\". Fearing a backlash from the trade unions, Lenin asked Stalin to build a support base in the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate (Rabkrin) against bureaucratism. Lenin's faction eventually prevailed at the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921. Frustrated by the squabbling factions within the Communist Party during what he saw as a time of crisis, Lenin convinced the Tenth Congress to pass a ban on any opposition to official Central Committee policy (the Ban on Factions, a law which Stalin would later exploit to expel his enemies).Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography. 2004. Stalin played a decisive role in engineering the Red Army invasion of Georgia in February and March 1921, at a time when Georgia was the biggest Menshevik stronghold. Following the invasion, Stalin adopted particularly hardline, centralist policies towards Soviet Georgia, which included severe repression of opposition to the Bolsheviks, and to opposition within the local Communist Party (e.g., the Georgian Affair of 1922), not to mention any manifestations of anti-Sovietism (the August Uprising of 1924).Knight, Ami W. (1991), Beria and the Cult of Stalin: Rewriting Transcaucasian Party History. Soviet Studies, Vol. 43, No. 4, pp. 749‚Äì763. It was in the Georgian affairs that Stalin first began to play his own hand.Shanin, Teodor (July 1989), Ethnicity in the Soviet Union: Analytical Perceptions and Political Strategies. Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 409‚Äì424. Lenin, however, disliked Stalin's policy towards Georgia, as he believed that all Soviet states should be on equal standing with Russia, rather than be absorbed and subordinated to Russia. Grigory Zinoviev successfully had Stalin appointed to the post of General Secretary in March 1922, with Stalin officially starting in the post on 3 April 1922. Stalin still held his posts in the Orgburo, the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate and the Commissariat for Nationalities Affairs, though he agreed to delegate his workload to subordinates. With this power, he would steadily place his supporters in positions of authority. Lenin's retirement and death Stalin visiting the ailing Lenin at his dacha in Gorki in 1922. On 25 May 1922, Lenin suffered a stroke while recovering from surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck since a failed assassination attempt in August 1918. Severely debilitated, he went into semi-retirement and moved to his dacha in Gorki. After this, prominent Bolsheviks were concerned about who would take over if Lenin actually died. Lenin and Trotsky had more of a personal and theoretical relationship, while Lenin and Stalin had more of a political and apparatical relationship. Yet, Stalin visited Lenin often, acting as his intermediary with the outside world. During this time, the two quarrelled over economic policy and how to consolidate the Soviet republics. One day, Stalin verbally swore at Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, for breaching Politburo orders by helping Lenin communicate with Trotsky and others about politics; this greatly offended Lenin. As their relationship deteriorated, Lenin dictated increasingly disparaging notes on Stalin in what would become his testament. Lenin criticised Stalin's rude manners, excessive power, ambition and politics, and suggested that Stalin should be removed from the position of General Secretary. One of Lenin's secretaries showed Stalin the notes, whose contents shocked him. On 9 March 1923, Lenin suffered his most debilitating stroke, which ended his political career. During Lenin's semi-retirement, Stalin forged a triumvirate alliance with Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev in May 1922, against Trotsky. These allies prevented Lenin's Testament from being revealed to the Twelfth Party Congress in April 1923. Although Zinoviev and Kamenev were disconcerted by Stalin's power and some of his policies, they needed Stalin's help in opposing Trotsky's faction and to prevent Trotsky's possible succession to Lenin in a power struggle. Lenin died on 21 January 1924. Stalin was given the honour of organizing his funeral. Upon Lenin's death, Stalin was officially hailed as his successor as the leader of the ruling Communist Party and of the Soviet Union itself. Against Lenin's wishes, he was given a lavish funeral and his body was embalmed and put on display. Thanks to Kamenev and Zinoviev's influence, the Central Committee decided that Lenin's Testament should not be made public. At the Thirteenth Party Congress in May 1924, it was read out only to the heads of the provincial delegations. Trotsky did not want to appear divisive so soon after Lenin's death and did not seize the opportunity to demand Stalin's removal. Downfall of Trotsky Stalin walks in the streets of Moscow in 1920s In the months following Lenin's death, Stalin's disputes with Zinoviev and Kamenev intensified. While the triumvirate remained intact throughout 1924 and the early months of 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev did not regard Stalin highly as a revolutionary theorist, and often disparaged him in private even as they had aided him publicly against Trotsky and the Left Opposition. For his part, Stalin was cautious about where the political situation was heading and often felt that Zinoviev's volatile rhetoric against Trotsky was going too far, especially when Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party in January 1925. Stalin opposed Zinoviev's demand and skillfully played the role of a moderate. At this time, Stalin was allying himself more and more with Nikolai Bukharin and the Right Opposition, whom Stalin had promoted to the Politburo at the Thirteenth Party Congress. Stalin proposed the theory of Socialism in One Country in October 1924, which Bukharin soon elaborated upon to give it a theoretical justification. Zinoviev and Kamenev suddenly found themselves in a minority at the Fourteenth Party Conference in April 1925, over their belief that socialism could only be achieved internationally, which resulted in the triumvirate splitting up. This saw a strengthening of Stalin's alliance with Bukharin. With Trotsky mostly sidelined with a persistent illness during 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev then formed the New Opposition against Stalin. At the Fourteenth Party Congress in December 1925, Stalin openly attacked Kamenev and Zinoviev, revealing that they had asked for his aid in expelling Trotsky from the Communist Party. Stalin's revelation made Zinoviev, in particular, very unpopular with many inside the Communist Party. Trotsky remained silent throughout this Congress. In early 1926, Zinoviev and Kamenev drew closer to Trotsky and the Left Opposition, forming an alliance that became known as the United Opposition. The United Opposition demanded, among other things, greater freedom of expression within the Communist Party and less bureaucracy. In October 1926, Stalin's supporters voted Trotsky out of the Politburo. During the years of 1926 and 1927, Soviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911,Sterling Seagrave, Dragon Lady (Alfred A. Knopf Inc.: New York, 1992) p. 454. resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, Puyi, on 12 February 1912.Compilation Group for the \\"History of Modern China Series, The Revolution of 1911 (Foreign Languages Press: Peking, 1976) p. 153. Sun Yat-sen established the Republic of China. In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \\"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\\" ‚Äî the Kuomintang. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a Northern Expedition was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese Communist Party to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working-class revolution.Joseph Stalin, \\"The Prospects of Revolution in China\\" a speech to the Chinese Commission of the Executive Committee of the Communist International on 30 November 1926\\" contained in J. Stalin on Chinese Revolution (Suren Dutt Publishers: Calcutta, India, 1970) pp. 5‚Äì21. Stalin believed that the KMT bourgeoisie, together with all patriotic national liberation forces in the country, would defeat the western imperialists in China. Trotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang's right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of April 1927 by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition. While the catastrophic events in China completely vindicated Trotsky's criticism of Stalin's approach towards the Chinese Revolution, this paled insignificance compared to the demoralization that the Soviet masses felt at such a big setback for socialist revolution in China, with this demoralization aiding Stalin and his allies in the Communist Party and the Soviet state. Attacks against the United Opposition increased in volatility and ferocity. Many supporters of Kamenev and Zinoviev's group, as well as most from the Workers Opposition grouping, had left the United Opposition by mid-1927, changing sides under the growing political pressure and espousing their support for Stalin. Trotsky, Kamenev, and Zinoviev grew increasingly isolated and were ejected from the Central Committee in October 1927. On 7 November 1927, on the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, the United Opposition held a demonstration in Red Square, Moscow, along with Vladimir Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya. On 12 November 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party itself, followed by Kamenev at the Fifteenth Party Congress in December 1927. At the Congress, where Kamenev acted as the United Opposition's spokesman due to Trotsky's and Zinoviev's expulsion, the United Opposition were unable to gain the support of more than a small minority of the Communist Party, and they were expelled after the Congress declared United Opposition views to be incompatible with Communist Party membership. While Trotsky remained firm in his opposition to Stalin after his expulsion from the Communist Party and his subsequent exile, Zinoviev and Kamenev capitulated almost immediately and called on their supporters to follow suit. They wrote open letters acknowledging their mistakes and were readmitted to the Communist Party in June 1928, after a six- month cooling-off period. They never regained their Central Committee seats, but they were given mid-level positions within the Soviet bureaucracy. Kamenev and Zinoviev were courted by Bukharin at the beginning of his short and ill- fated struggle with Stalin in the summer of 1928. This activity was soon reported to Stalin and was later used against Bukharin as proof of his factionalism. Trotsky, firmer than ever in his opposition to Stalin, was exiled to Alma-ata in January 1928 and was exiled from the Soviet Union itself in February 1929, sent into exile in Turkey. From his exile, Trotsky continued to oppose Stalin, right up until Trotsky was assassinated on Stalin's orders in August 1940. Stalin turns on the Right Stalin birthday in 1929. Left to right: Mikhail Kalinin, Lazar Kaganovich, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Stalin, Voroshilov, Valerian Kuybyshev (obscured), Sergei Kirov. 17th Party Congress. Standing far left is Avel Yenukidze, far right - Valerian Kuybyshev. After the United Opposition were illegalized in December 1927, the Kulaks and NEPmen were emboldened and exerted much greater economic pressure on the Soviet government in the months afterwards. In January 1928, Stalin personally travelled to Siberia where he oversaw the seizure of grain stockpiles from kulak farmers. Many in the Communist Party supported the seizures, but Bukharin and Premier Rykov were outraged.Simon Sebag Montefiore. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, Knopf, 2004 (). Bukharin criticized Stalin's plans for rapid industrialization financed by kulak wealth, and advocated a return to Lenin's NEP. However, Bukharin was unable to rally sufficient support from the higher levels of the Communist Party to oppose Stalin. By the latter months of 1928, a critical shortfall in grain supplies prompted Stalin to push for collectivisation of agriculture. Stalin began pushing for more rapid industrialisation and central control of the economy, a position which alienated Bukharin and the Right Opposition, but which appeared close to what the Left Opposition had advocated before they were banned. Stalin accused Bukharin of factionalism and capitalist tendencies. The other Politburo members sided with Stalin, and labelled Bukharin a \\"Right Deviationist\\" from Marxist‚ÄìLeninist principles. Bukharin was ejected from the Politburo in November 1929. Stalin's agricultural policies were also criticized by fellow Politburo member Mikhail Kalinin. In the summer of 1930, Stalin exposed Kalinin's embezzlement of state funds, which he spent on a mistress. Kalinin begged forgiveness and effectively submitted himself to Stalin. In September 1930, Stalin proposed dismissing Premier Rykov, who was Bukharin's fellow oppositionist. The other Politburo members agreed with Stalin, and supported his nomination of Vyacheslav Molotov. On December 19, the Central Committee dismissed Rykov and replaced him with Molotov. After 1930, open criticism of Stalin within the Communist Party was virtually non-existent, though Stalin continued to hunt for discreet dissenters. Stalin dominated the Politburo (the policy-making branch of the Communist Party) through staunch allies such as Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Lazar Kaganovich, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Kliment Voroshilov. Death of his wife On the night of 9 November 1932, Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, committed suicide and shot herself in her bedroom. As Stalin was sleeping in another room, her death was not discovered until the next morning. To prevent a scandal, Pravda reported the cause of death as appendicitis. Stalin did not tell his children the truth, to prevent them from revealing it accidentally. The Great Terror On 1 December 1934, Sergei Kirov was murdered by Leonid Nikolaev. The death of this popular, high-profile politician shocked Russia, and Stalin used this murder to begin The Great Terror. Within hours of Kirov's death, Stalin declared Grigory Zinoviev and his supporters to be responsible for Kirov's murder. Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev were arrested and, to escape long prison sentences, confessed to political and moral responsibility for Kirov's murder. In January 1935, Zinoviev was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, and Kamenev was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. Stalin sanctioned the formation of troikas for the purpose of extrajudicial punishment. In April 1935, Kamenev's prison sentence was increased by another 5 years, to a total of 10 years imprisonment. Hundreds of oppositionists linked to Kamenev and Zinoviev were arrested and exiled to Siberia. In late 1935, Stalin reopened the case. Kamenev and Zinoviev were interrogated again, and the exiled Trotsky was now accused of being the leading mastermind in Kirov's murder. As in claimed by Montefiore, in July 1936, Stalin promised Kamenev and Zinoviev (through NKVD chief, Genrikh Yagoda) that there would be no executions or persecution of their families if they confessed to conspiring with Trotsky. Stalin's promise was soon broken. A few weeks later, after a trial, Kamenev and Zinoviev were both executed on 25 August 1936. Spearheading Stalin's purges was a Commissar called Nikolai Yezhov, a fervent Stalinist and a believer in violent repression. Nikolai Yezhov continued to expand the lists of suspects to include all the old oppositionists as well as entire nationalities, such as the Poles. Stalin distrusted the Soviet secret police ‚Äì the NKVD ‚Äì which was filled with Old Bolsheviks and ethnicities he distrusted, such as Poles, Jews and Latvians. In September 1936, Stalin fired the head of the NKVD, Genrikh Yagoda, and replaced him with the more aggressive and zealous Yezhov, with Yezhov overseeing the most brutally oppressive period of Stalin's Great Purge from late 1936 to late 1938. In June 1937, The Case of the Trotskyist Anti- Soviet Military Organization took place. Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky and the senior Red Army military officers Iona Yakir, Ieronim Uborevich, Robert Eideman, August Kork, Vitovt Putna, Boris Feldman and Vitaly Primakov (as well as Yakov Gamarnik, who committed suicide before the investigations began) were accused of anti-Soviet conspiracy and sentenced to death; they were executed on the night of 11 to 12 June 1937, immediately after the verdict delivered by a Special Session (—Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å—É–¥–µ–±–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ) of the Supreme Court of the USSR. The Tribunal was presided over by Vasili Ulrikh and included marshals Vasily Blyukher, Semyon Budyonny and Army Commanders Yakov Alksnis, Boris Shaposhnikov, Ivan Panfilovich Belov, Pavel Dybenko, and Nikolai Kashirin. Only Ulrikh, Budyonny and Shaposhnikov would survive the purges that followed. The Tukhachevsky trial triggered a massive subsequent purge of the Red Army. In September 1938, the People's Commissar for Defence, Voroshilov, reported that a total of 37,761 officers and commissars were dismissed from the army, 10,868 were arrested and 7,211 were condemned for anti-Soviet crimes. Since his falling out with Stalin in 1928‚Äì1929, Bukharin had written an endless stream of letters of repentance and admiration to Stalin. However, Stalin knew that Bukharin's repentance was insincere, as in private Bukharin continued to criticize Stalin and seek out other opponents of Stalin (the NKVD wiretapped Bukharin's telephone). Shortly before their executions in August 1936, Kamenev and Zinoviev had denounced Bukharin as a traitor during their trial. At the December 1936 plenum of the Central Committee, Yezhov accused Bukharin and Alexei Rykov of treachery. Bukharin confessed to conspiring against Stalin, and was executed on 15 March 1938, on the same day that former NKVD chief, Yagoda, was also executed. Stalin eventually turned on Yezhov. He appointed Yezhov Commissar of Water Transport in April 1938 (a similar thing had happened to Yezhov's predecessor, Yagoda, shortly before he was fired). Stalin began ordering the executions of Yezhov's prot√©g√©s in the NKVD. Politburo members also started to openly condemn the excesses of the NKVD under Yezhov's leadership, all of which gave the signal that Yezhov was falling from Stalin's favour. Yezhov eventually suffered a nervous breakdown and resigned as NKVD chief on 23 November 1938. Yezhov was replaced as NKVD chief by Lavrentiy Beria. Yezhov was executed on 4 February 1940.

As a traditional troll is said to collect a toll from those trying to cross a bridge, a trademark troll \\"magically appears when an unsuspecting producer adopts the same or similar mark and poses upon them two choices: pay to get a license to use my mark or litigate\\". The existence of trademark trolls exemplifies a common misunderstanding about trademark rights: the mere registration of a mark does not give the trademark owner a monopoly over that mark but must be used in commerce. As a consequence, while Leo Stoller, who has been labelled a \\"prototypical trademark troll\\" by intellectual property attorney Anna B. Folgers, had brought 47 trademark infringement suits , no court had found any infringement and the Northern District of Illinois had enjoined him from filing new actions without the court's permission. In a similar manner, the business practices of Tim Langdell of Edge Games were referred to as trolling by the US District Court after it was found that there was no evidence of commercial use of the asserted marks but that there was instead evidence that Langdell had fraudulently obtained and/or maintained many of his registrations.Edge Games, Inc. v.

He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of RRJ Capital, one of the largest private equity funds based in Asia. Richard was also a founder and CEO of Hopu Fund 1, a Beijing-based private equity fund.https://www.ft.com/content/52fb5764-970f-11e4-845a-00144feabdc0 https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=261904107&privcapId;=127380687 Career Early career Ong started his finance career at Chase Manhattan Bank, where he worked for three years as a mergers banker; he also spent a year at Prudential Bache International. Goldman Sachs Ong joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 and became a partner of the firm seven years later. He was later named to the position of co-president of Goldman's Singapore office. In 2006, Ong was promoted to the position of co-head of Asia investment banking, replacing Bill Wicker, who moved to New York. GS moved Ong from Singapore to Beijing with the intention that he would also become CEO of their Beijing joint venture Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, Co. However, Ong's weak knowledge of written Chinese led him to fail a language ability examination required to take up his new position. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had required since 2004 that CEOs, deputy CEOs, and heads of supervisory boards at locally incorporated securities firms all pass the examination; however many CEOs and deputy CEOs of other securities companies were not able to pass the CSRC examination as well, but were given waivers. Goldman elevated the joint venture's deputy CEO Zha Xiangyang to the CEO post in Ong's place. One industry observer criticised the decision by CSRC to deny Ong his new position as \\"short sighted and xenophobic\\", also noting that it served as a wake-up call to overseas Chinese that shared ethnicity was not a guarantee of success in the mainland China market. A China Economic Review editorial speculated that the language proficiency issue was merely a pretext, and that the true reason that CSRC denied Goldman permission to name Ong to his new position was due to his family ties to Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings and his own role in the money-losing sale of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's Shin Corporation to Temasek. Hopu Fund In January 2008, Ong resigned from his position at GS, ending a fifteen-year tenure there; his departure was seen as a major blow to the firm. He stated that he planned to return to Malaysia to spend time with his family and work in his family business. It soon emerged that he would be joining fellow former GS executive Fang Fenglei at the Hopu Fund, a new China private equity fund established by Fang. Goldman planned to invest roughly US$300 million of their own money in the new fund, while Temasek would provide another US$1 billion. The total size of the fund was planned at US$2 billion; interest from potential investors far exceeded that amount, according to unnamed sources. In 2010 the fund began winding down when it announced that Hopu Investment Management would not be raising a second fund. https://www.ft.com/content/8185fafc-e6b1-11df-99b3-00144feab49a  RRJ Capital  RRJ Capital, founded in 2011, is based in Hong Kong and Singapore with 40 professionals currently employed.

K≈çmy≈ç-ji is number one among the , a group of 18 J≈çdo temples established during the Edo period by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and dedicated to both the training of priests and scholarly research. It is also the sect's head temple for the Kant≈ç region. In spite of the fact it is a J≈çdo sect temple, K≈çmy≈ç-ji has several of the typical features of a Zen temple, for example a sanmon (main gate), a pond and a karesansui (rock garden). K≈çmy≈ç-ji has always enjoyed the patronage of Japan's powerful and is the only Buddhist temple in Kamakura to have had the privilege of being a daimy≈çs funeral temple. It was chosen for that role by the Nait≈ç clan, feudal lords from today's Miyazaki Prefecture whose tombs are part of the temple's compound. The temple, besides the usual Buddhist cemetery, maintains a special crypt for the ashes of house pets and other animals, and twice a year holds in the Main Hall ceremonies in their memory. The crypt was created and is maintained by a group of veterinarian volunteers. The temple holds occasional music concerts in its main hall, concerts that are announced in its Wweb site. For 3500 yen, visitors who make a reservation can try at K≈çmy≈ç-ji the vegetarian food the resident priests themselves eat. Entrance is free, with the exception of the sanmon, which can be visited only telephoning the temple, explaining the motives for the planned visit, making a reservation and paying a small fee. History K≈çmy≈ç-ji's Main Hall K≈çmy≈ç-ji's precise origins are unclear. According to the temple itself, it was founded by Kamakura's fourth regent and de facto ruler of Japan H≈çj≈ç Tsunetoki. According to this version of events, it was originally built in 1240 in the Sasukegayatsu Valley near Jufuku-ji for famous Buddhist priest Nenna :ja:Ry≈çch≈´ (also known by his posthumous name Kishu Zenji). It was then called Renge-ji, or \\"Temple of Lotuses\\", a name which is still part of its official full name.Shirai (1976:116-117)Mutsu (1995/06: 293-312) Tradition says Tsunetoki received in a dream the divine order to rename the temple K≈çmy≈ç-ji, or \\"Temple of the Shining Light\\", and soon thereafter decided to move it to its present location near the sea. The usual date given by the temple itself for the transfer and the name change is 1243, however it isn't clearly supported by any historical record. It would be therefore more precise to say that the date of foundation is unclear.Kamiya Vo.1 (2008:146-151) According to a variant of the theory, Renge-ji was originally opened for Ry≈çch≈´ by H≈çj≈ç Tomonao (a.k.a. :ja:Osaragi Tomonao) with the name . K≈çmy≈ç-ji was later sponsored by H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori and other Kamakura regents, acquiring a and becoming a center of Amidist devotion in the Kant≈ç region.K≈çmy≈ç-ji official Web site, K≈çmy≈ç-ji ni tsuite, accessed on February 18, 2009 Ry≈çch≈´ presided over the temple for more than forty years, dying there in 1287. During the following years, the temple enjoyed the continuous religious and financial support of emperors, sh≈çguns and daimy≈çs, among them Ashikaga Takauji and several other Muromachi period sh≈çguns, taik≈ç Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and their generosity is well attested by the temple's archives. Three different emperors, Go-Hanazono, Go-Tsuchimikado and Go-Uda, donated it their own calligraphy. During the Muromachi period it was restored by Y≈´sh≈ç Sh≈çnin and in 1495 Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado made it his praying temple. When Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1547 created the group of temples, he dedicated it to the training of priests and scholarship, and put K≈çmy≈ç-ji at its top.Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei The buildings presently part of its compound belong to different eras, the s≈çmon (first gate) being the oldest (it was built in the first half of the 17th century) and the Kaisand≈ç (Founder's Hall) the newest (having been built in 1924). Features The temple's gates are a few hundred meters from the ruins of Wakaejima, an artificial island built in 1232 which, in spite of its state of disrepair, has been declared a national Historic Site because it's the sole surviving example of artificial harbor of the Kamakura period. Wakaejima used to be the point of entry of most of the cargo needed to support the city and it's likely that at least part of K≈çmy≈ç-ji's own timber came from there. The Zen style main gate (the was first erected in 1495, then restored in 1624‚Äì28, and it is believed that part of the old timber was reused for the reconstruction. The huge Hon-d≈ç (Main Hall) is an Important Cultural Property.Harada (2007:97) To its left lie the Kaisand≈ç and the Shoin drawing room. Between them is the temple's lotus pond, designed in the early 17th century. The sanmon K≈çmy≈ç-ji's huge sanmon, the biggest in the Kant≈ç regionThe temple's huge sanmon (the second gate, see photo) is an 1847 reconstruction of an older original.According to some sources sanmon used to stand at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g≈´ and was later transferred here, others mention the point to disagree. The 16 meter wide structure has two stories, the first in traditional Japanese style, the second in Zen (Chinese) style. The characters on the gable under the Sanmon were written by Emperor Go-Hanazono himself in 1436 and sent to the temple as a present. The Sanmon's second floor contains several statues, the most important of which are the so-called , or Shakyamuni Trinity, three statues which represent Shaka, Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bosatsu. (The statue of Fugen Bosatsu has however been lost). The so- called Shi Tenn≈ç, or Four Heavenly Kings (Deva Kings) are statues of four protector gods. These are accompanied by the . All the statues were built during the late Edo period. The Sanmon is usually closed to the public, but it's occasionally opened for ceremonies or festivities, and can be visited at any time telephoning the temple, explaining the motives for the visit and paying a small fee.K≈çmy≈ç-ji's official site, Sanmon, accessed on February 16, 2009 The rock garden K≈çmy≈ç-ji's rock garden with its eight rocksLocated next to the main hall, the rock garden consists of white raked gravel, some rhododendrons and eight rocks. Each rock represents a saint or a god. The group of three to the left, surrounded by plants, represent the Amida trinity, with Amida Amida Nyorai at the center, Seishi to the left and goddess Kannon to the right. The remaining five stones represent Shakyamuni and four priests who contributed to the diffusion of Buddhism: Zend≈ç, H≈çnen, Bench≈ç, and the temple's own Ry≈çch≈´. Rock gardens are often called Zen gardens because they normally are a feature of Zen temples of the Rinzai sect like Kamakura's own Kench≈ç-ji, Engaku-ji and Zuisen-ji, which all have one. It is therefore rare to find one in a J≈çdo temple. The rock garden is a popular gathering spot among the numerous stray cats that live on the premises. The pet cemetery sot≈çba (wooden stupas) are those of pets: Jiro, Top, Goemon and Nonnon Immediately after the sanmon, next to the cemetery lies the , an animal mortuary maintained by the Sh≈çnan J≈´ishikai D≈çbutsu Reid≈ç H≈çsankai, a group of volunteers affiliated with a local association of veterinarians, the Sh≈çnan J≈´ishikai.K≈çmy≈ç-ji official Web site, D≈çbutsu Reid≈ç accessed on February 18, 2009 The veterinarians of the association had originally created the crypt at K≈çmy≈ç-ji to inter the ashes of cats, dogs, birds and other animals who had died in their care but, after many other pet owners expressed the wish to bury their animals there too, the association decided to grant the wish to all who apply after the payment of a small fee. The ashes are laid to rest on the 10th day of every month after the chanting of s≈´tras, and are often accompanied by a sot≈çba (a wooden stupa), carrying the pet's name (see photo). Twice a year, in spring and autumn, a memorial service is held in the temple's main hall for the souls of the dead animals. K≈çmy≈ç-ji's Ten Nights of Prayer Every year, from 12 to 25 October, K≈çmy≈ç-ji holds the , a celebration which started in 1495 and consists of three days and three nights of uninterrupted s≈´tra chanting in the main hall.K≈çmy≈ç-ji's official site, J≈´ya, accessed on February 16, 2009 The festival was born by order of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, who invited the temple's ninth abbot Yushu Sh≈çnin to Kyoto, where he was given permission to hold a rite consisting of ten days and ten nights of continuous prayer. Nowadays the rites last only three days, but are performed in J≈çdo temples all over the country. Because the event attracts so many people, during those days the temple's compound is full of stands, selling mostly potted plants, but also food and drinks.

It was the first adoption of a semi-automatic service pistol by the land army of a major power.Semi-automatic pistols were adopted earlier only by the Swiss Army and the Imperial German Navy (both: Parabellum), and the Italian Royal Navy (Mauser C96). Erenfeicht, L., p. 49. Mechanism  The Roth‚ÄìSteyr pistol fires from an unusual style of locked breech. The bolt is very long. Its rear end is solid, except for a sleeve for the striker, but its front part is hollow and fits tightly over the barrel. The interior of the bolt has cam grooves cut into it, and the barrel has studs which fit into the grooves. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together within the hollow receiver for about 0.5 inch. During this operation, the helical grooves in the muzzle bush cause the barrel to turn 90 degrees clockwise, after which it is held while the unlocked bolt continues to the rear, cocking the action as it does so. For safety in the intended use by mounted cavalry, the pistol has a heavy trigger pull against the firing striker spring, similar to a hammerless revolver.Smith, W. H. B. Small Arms of the World (1953) Military Service Publishing Company p.13 The Roth‚ÄìSteyr is a locked-breech pistol, which allows the barrel and bolt to recoil together within a hollow receiver. It is chambered for a cartridge specific to this model. The Roth‚ÄìSteyr does not have a detachable magazine, but features a fixed magazine loaded from the top with stripper clips. The sights are fixed, the grips are wooden and terminate in a lanyard ring. Rifling is four grooves with right-hand twist. Production and distribution  The pistol was developed by the Czech designer Karel Krnka, working for the ammunition company of Georg Roth, based on the earlier Roth‚ÄìTheodorovic pistol. After development and tests of several prototypes, the final version of the Roth‚ÄìKrnka won a contest for an Army pistol in 1906, and was adapted as a standard gun of Austro-Hungarian Army as: Repetierpistole M.7. (self-loading pistol M1907). Since Roth had no weapon production capabilities, the government bought all the rights and ordered production in the √ñsterreichische Waffenfabriksgesellschaft (OEWG) in Steyr and FEG in Budapest. From 1908 to 1914, approximately 99,000 weapons were manufactured (the Army received 59,334 from Steyr and 38,213 from FEG, plus several hundred were sold on the civilian market). Despite common name for the pistol Roth‚ÄìSteyr, Steyr works did not participate in its design, apart from minor improvements. Following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the Roth‚ÄìSteyr was fielded by Yugoslavia, with limited use during World War II by the Austrians and Hungarians. Italy received a number of pistols as World War I reparations from Austria-Hungary, and these pistols were used by Italian troops during World War II.

It was produced by a wide variety of manufacturers between 1889 and 1931 in both Spain and Italy. The Bodeo was employed by the Royal Italian Army in World War I, the Interwar Italian colonial wars, and World War II. The Bodeo comes in two distinct varieties with only superficial weapons differences. History Made by a large variety of Italian gun-makers, the Bodeo became the service revolver of the Italian Army in 1891.Hogg, Ian, Pistols of the World 4th Edition (2004) p. 49 The revolver was named after the head of the Italian commission that recommended its adoption, Carlo Bodeo.McNab, Chris, The Great Book of Guns (2004) p. 105 It remained the principle handgun of the Italian Army until it was increasingly supplanted by the Glisenti Model 1910. The revolver was never declared obsolete and remained as a reserve weapon until the end of World War II.Hogg, Ian, Military Small Arms of the 20th Century 7th Edition (2000) p. 59 The Italian manufacturers identified with the production of the Bodeo include: Societa Siderurgica Glisenti, Castelli of Brescia, Metallurgica Bresciana, and Vincenzo Bernardelli of Gardone Val Trompia.Hogg, Ian, Pistols of the World 4th Edition (2004) p. 50 During World War I, Spanish manufacturers Errasti and Arrostegui of Eibar produced the Bodeo for the Italian government. The Italians nicknamed this revolver coscia d‚Äôagnello (\\"leg of lamb\\"). During World War II, the Wehrmacht designated the Bodeo as Revolver 680(i) when utilized as an alternative firearm.Luciano Salvatici. Pistole Militari Italiane Design details Alternates Royal Arsenal of Brescia mark The Bodeo Model 1889 is a solid-framed, six-shot revolver. The revolver was designed in two distinct versions: a round-barreled version designed with a trigger guard, and an octagonal-barreled version with a folding trigger. The octagonal-barreled version was produced for rank and file Italian soldiers, while the round-barreled version was produced for non-commissioned officers and field officers. The folding trigger version was produced in greater numbers. Mechanics The Bodeo was considered simple and robust. Due to the revolver being produced by a multitude of manufacturers, the quality of the weapon varied greatly. Frames were made from a wide variety of materials ranging from brass to brazed copper plates.Kinard, Jeff. Pistols: an illustrated history of their impact, p. 157, ABC-CLIO, Inc. 2003. The gate was connected to the hammer with the barrel screwed into the frame. Ejection was achieved by the rod normally housed in the hollow axis pin. The hammer block was designed to prevent firing unless the trigger was fully cocked.

Plot summary The story begins at sea when the unnamed Skipper (Prochnow) of the sailboat Bella Donna reports a man overboard. The victim, Paul Pelikan, drowns before he can be rescued. People in the Bella Donna's home port of Gibraltar suspect that the Skipper deliberately pushed Paul overboard because he'd had an affair with the Skipper's wife Mona (Gra≈ºyna Szapo≈Çowska). Though nothing is proven, Mona believes the Skipper did in fact throw Paul overboard and leaves him. Heartbroken, the Skipper spends most of his time at the local bars getting drunk and swearing he will sail again, though the townspeople don't take his claim seriously. Meanwhile, two English girls Su (Kensit) and Lou (Hurley) are barely making a living singing at local clubs. Though fast friends, there seems to be tension between the two. They put on a show at the California Bar that night, singing an English language version of Porque te vas (translated as You're Leaving Me). The Skipper is present for the performance and falls hard for the two, especially after Lou performs an impromptu striptease at the end. After spending the night with the two girls, the Skipper agrees to their request to sail them to Barbados. Though the voyage will take four weeks, all seems to be well at the start. The Skipper does express some concern in his ship's log about how close the two girls are, then injects himself with a syringe. As time passes, Su flirts with the Skipper, but becomes upset when her advances are ignored, revealing a somewhat unbalanced personality. As tensions further mount, Su snoops through the Skipper's quarters and finds his serum bottles, syringes and his log book. She tells Lou that she thinks the Skipper is a murderer and a drug addict. When he discovers the missing serum, which turns out to be insulin, he throws Su overboard with a line, in an attempt to get her to reveal where she hid it. He pulls her back in and gives her an ultimatum, \\"I'll give you one hour\\". He soon becomes very ill and incapacitated. A desperate Lou eventually finds the insulin and injects the Skipper, saving his life. A grateful Skipper later confesses his love for Lou. Lou responds \\"What about Su?\\" The Skipper replies \\"What about Su?\\" Su then walks in on them having sex. Su is heartbroken and starts crying. Lou, feeling guilty, tries to comfort Su. Things seem to have smoothed over at the end, when the girls reprise their act, singing \\"You're Leaving Me\\" again. Without warning, Lou shoots the Skipper with a spear gun, killing him almost instantly. In terror, Su flees below deck. Lou takes a moment to draw a heart and arrow in the Skipper's pooling blood before going to the galley to make a cup of tea. She seems oddly calm while Su is quaking in terror over what's happened. Lou tries to calm Su down but ends up smothering her with a pillow. As the end title states, three weeks later, the Bella Donna drifts to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, with no one aboard.

It was the standard issue sidearm for officers in the French military during the First World War. The Mod√®le 1892 revolver is a solid frame revolver with the cylinder on a separate frame swinging right for manual reloading. The Mod√®le 1892 was first fielded in 1893 and was prominent among French military officers during First World War, and later the French police until the mid-1960s. A mechanically tight and very well finished handgun, the Mod√®le 1892 fires 8mm rounds with a striking power equivalent to that of a .32 ACP round. It also features a smaller calibre than many other military revolvers of that time period, including the Webley revolver and its predecessor the MAS 1873 revolver. History The MAS 1887, a variant of the MAS 1885 chambred in 8mm, and precursor to the MAS 1892 Though it was originally designed to serve as a commissioned officer's personal sidearm, over 350,000 Mod√®le 1892 revolvers were manufactured between 1892 and 1924. It was issued in the French Army, French Navy, and French Gendarmerie, amongst others. It is commonly, but mistakenly, called a \\"Lebel revolver\\" after the name of Colonel Nicolas Lebel, although there is no evidence whatsoever that Lebel had any involvement in the creation of the gun or its ammunition.Kinard, Jeff. Pistols: an illustrated history of their impact, p. 154, ABC-CLIO, Inc. 2003. Non-commissioned officers continued to carry the older Mle 1873 service revolver, but were also frequently issued .32 ACP automatic pistols (the Ruby pistol) during World War I. The Mle 1892 was later officially replaced by semi-automatic pistols in 1935 but many saw service during World War II and were brought to the United States as souvenirs.Wood,J.B. Book of Revolver Assembly and Disassembly, p. 152, Krause Publications, 2011. A Mod√®le 1892 was used in the 2018 Strasbourg attack. Mechanics Originally chambered for an 8mm black-powder cartridge closely resembling the .32-20 WCF round, later models issued during World War I and thereafter fired the same 8mm cartridge loaded with smokeless powder. The Mle 1892 revolver is a double-action solid-frame design, with chambers being accessed by swinging out the cylinder to the right. The fired cases can then be pushed out of the cylinder at the same time. After reloading, the cylinder is swung back into the frame and locked into place with the case- hardened loading gate located on the right side of the frame.McNab,Chris The Great Book of Guns, p. 108, Thunder Bay Press, 2004. In addition, the left sideplate of the frame can be swung back on a hinge to give access to the gun's internal parts for oiling or cleaning. These parts were individually numbered to indicate the order in which they can be disassembled. The year of manufacture of each revolver is engraved on the right side of the barrel, for instance \\"S 1895. The inscription \\"Mle 1892 is hand engraved on top of the barrel. It was carried in a large closed leather holster, which held an additional 12 rounds of ammunition hidden below the flap. Legacy The Mle 1892 is a mechanically tight, accurate and very well finished revolver. It can be fired single-action by cocking the hammer first or by double-action by a full trigger pull. Its downside is the relative weakness, for a military handgun, of its 8√ó27mm ammunition.McNab, Chris. The Great Book of Guns. p. 108. Thunder Bay Press, 2004. In terms of striking power, it just barely reaches the level of the .32 ACP.

It was produced by Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne from 1873 to 1887 in about 337,000 copies. Although replaced by the Modele 1892 revolver, it was nevertheless widely used during the First World War, and issued to reserve units in 1940. The Resistance made widespread use of it during the Occupation. The model 1874, of which 35,000 were made, was an officer's version. It differs from the model 1873 by having a lighter structure and a darker finish. Many copies for civilian sale were made in France and Belgium. Both the 1873 and the 1874 use an 11mm cartridge which proved to have insufficient velocity. The weapons themselves were very reliable and resistant to damage. A Navy version was also produced. A more powerful cartridge was produced for this version, but production ceased and they turned to the regular ammunition when the stocks were depleted. Overview The Franco-Prussian War in 1870 clearly demonstrated the need for up-to-date equipment in war time. A great military tradition and esprit de corps can be defeated by superior training, and in the case of that war, artillery. After the war, both Germany and France continued to improve their military technology. However, neither side was convinced of the importance of pistols for field officers. The sword continued to be the symbol of authority for an officer on the battlefield all the way into World War I. European general staffs at that time were extremely conservative and pistols were sometimes grudgingly adopted as personal defense weapons with no practical offensive use. Even as pistols became more of a symbol of the officer, most preferred to privately purchase a smaller and more comfortable handgun instead of using a large standard issue revolver. The Chamelot-Delvigne 11mm Modele 1873 was adopted by the French army as a service revolver for non-commissioned officers. The Modele 1874 Revolver d'Officier was the version issued to officers. The differences between the two models included the following: the 1873 was finished in the white, whereas the 1874 had a fluted cylinder and a blued finish. The 1873 and 1874 were the first center-fire cartridge revolvers adopted by the French army. They had solid-frame, side-ejection, double-action mechanisms. The pistols were manufactured by the St. Etienne arsenal, which still continues to manufacture fine sporting arms. The design of the Chamelot- Delvigne revolvers became so popular that versions were adopted by the Belgian in 1871, Italian, and 1872 in Switzerland with the Model 1872 Revolver. Revolver Model 1872 The caliber of these French pistols was 11x17.8mmR. The French round was actually 0.47 mm larger than its German counterpart. The German round could be loaded and used in the French pistol, but French rounds would not chamber in the German pistol. The cartridge had a pointed lead bullet weighing 11 grams. The case length was 17.8 mm, which was rather on the short side. Reloading this cartridge could take some patience due to the shortness of the case. Military specifications called for black powder loads, replaced by a mild smokeless powder in the early twentieth century. Standard muzzle velocity was around 550 feet per second. The cylinder had a side- loading gate which pulled straight to the rear. The sight picture was a ball and v type and is easy to align. It could be difficult to stay on target when shooting double-action due to the stiffness of the action. There was certainly no danger of accidentally pulling the trigger double-action. Cleaning and disassembly were easy as the cylinder pin doubled as a screwdriver and all- purpose tool. Internal parts were finely machined and finished. The trigger, hammer, and several of the internal springs were straw-finished, a type of case-hardening hot oil finish. The French pistols began their service with the French army in the late 19th century and saw service all over the globe in French colonies. Many saw service in World War I when European armies finally realized how important pistols were in the trenches. The Chamelot-Delvigne finally ended its venerable service as a police sidearm in World War II.http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_fgp.html  Features   Army model 73  * Length: 240 mm * Barrel length: 115 mm * Weight (empty): 1.04 kg * Cylinder: 6 cartridges * Ammunition: 11 mm Mle 1873 (11x17mmR) * Rifling: 4 right-hand grooves * Operation: DA/SA http://www.gunsworld.com/french/18xx/1873_gen_us.html Army model 74  * Length: 240mm * Barrel length: 110mm * Weight (empty): 1.08 kg * Cylinder: 6 cartridges * Ammunition: 11 mm MLE 1873 (11x17mmR) * Rifling: 4 right-hand grooves * Operation: DA/SA * Muzzle Velocity: 600 ft/sec  Usage  Model 1873 was issued to the French Army, the French Navy, the National Gendarmerie, and the French National Police until 1962.

History  180,000 copies were produced by the firm Leopold Gasser Waffenfabrik in Vienna from 1898 to 1912. The M1898 was planned to be replaced in the Austro-Hungarian cavalry by the Roth‚ÄìSteyr M1907, and in the infantry by the Steyr M1912, prior to the outbreak of the First World War. However production of newer pistols was not sufficient and the weapon continued in service, especially issued to NCOs, officers and as a secondary weapons to machinegunners. In some armies it was used up through the Second World War, including Italy and Yugoslavia. The quality manufacture and the strength of the solid-frame design made it a reliable and consistent military weapon. The M1898 was copied in Belgium by Manufacture d'Armes Li√©geoise in 7.62 Nagant caliber. Operation The Rast & Gassers featured some new elements of revolver design, as well as older elements already obsolete at the time of its manufacture. A solid-frame double-action revolver, it had a loading-gate through which individual cartridges are loaded, and extracted individually by an extractor rod. The firing pin was located on a transfer piece on the frame of the revolver rather than the hammer, an advancement at the time. Its ammunition is similar to but not interchangeable with that of the 8mm French Ordnance. The cylinder could be removed by pulling down on the trigger guard and withdrawing the axis pin/ejector rod.  Loading  To load the M1898, the hammer is rotated back slightly until it is in the half-cock position. This safeguards against the hammer accidentally striking a cartridge while the user is loading the weapon. The loading-gate is then rotated back, exposing the rear of the cylinder. Doing this disengages the hammer from the trigger, but the cylinder will still rotate if the trigger is squeezed. This feature makes loading much easier and faster. Cartridges are then inserted into the cylinder and the trigger squeezed to rotate the cylinder for the next empty slot. After all the slots have been loaded, the loading-gate is closed by pushing it forward. The hammer is then rotated all the way back to the full-cocked position ready for firing. To unload the M1898, the hammer is rotated back slightly until it is in the half-cock position. The loading-gate is opened and the ejector rod is pulled back to eject either spent casings or unused cartridges. To remove the cylinder, the trigger guard is pulled down and the ejector rod-cylinder axis is then withdrawn and the cylinder removed.

The gun was produced from 1931 to 1938 in roughly 10,000 exemplars (in three main variants) and exported to Spain, Mexico, China and Yugoslavia, but also used domestically by the SS. It was produced under license in Spain by the arsenal of A Coru√±a under the designation M41/44.  History  In the early 1920s, Vollmer started to develop his own sub-machineguns. His early models, named VPG, VPGa, VPF and VMP1925 were fairly similar to the MP18. The VMP1925 had a wooden handgrip and was fed by a 25-round drum magazine. The VMP1925 was secretly tested by the Reichswehr, along with competing designs from Schmeisser and Rheinmetall. (The Reichswehr was prohibited by the Versailles Treaty from having sub-machine guns in service, although the German police were allowed to carry a small number.) Secret funding was given to Vollmer to continue development, and this resulted in the VMP1926, which mostly differed from its predecessor by the removal of the cooling jacket. A subsequent development was the VMP1928, which introduced a 32-round box magazine sticking from the left side. The final development of this series was the VMP1930. (It can also be seen at the WTS.) This model introduced a substantive innovation‚Äîa telescoping main spring assembly, which made the gun more reliable and easier to assemble and disassemble in the field. Vollemer applied for a patent for his innovation in 1930 and it was granted in 1933 as DRP# 580620. His company, Vollmer Werke, produced however only about 400 of these, and most were sold to Bulgaria. In late 1930, the Reichswehr stopped supporting Vollmer financially; consequently he sold the rights to all his designs to the company known as Erma Werke (which is an abbreviation for Erfurter Maschinenfabrik, Berthold Geipel GmbH). The submachine guns that Erma started to sell in 1932 under the names EMP (Erma Maschinenpistole) or MPE (Maschinenpistole Erma) was basically just the VMP1930 with the cooling jacket restored. Although there were several variants with varying barrel lengths and sights made to customers' specifications, roughly three main variants were produced: one with a 30 cm barrel, tangent rear sight and bayonet lug was apparently sold to Bulgaria or Yugoslavia. The second model, sometimes called the MP34, or the \\"standard model\\", had a 25 cm barrel and no provision for a bayonet; the rear sight on these varies‚Äîsome had a tangent sight, others a simplified flip-up \\"L\\" sight. A third variant was basically similar in the metallic parts, but replaced the foregrip with an MP18-style stock with finger-grooves. Overall, at least 10,000 of these Vollmer-based designs were made by Erma. They were adopted by the SS and the German Police, but also sold to Mexico, Yugoslavia and Spain. During the Spanish Civil War, the EMP was used by both the Republicans and the Nationalists. In the Spring of 1939, a large number of defeated Spanish Republicans fled to France, where they were disarmed. Some 3,250 EMPs formerly in the possession of these fighters ended up in a French warehouse at Clermont-Ferrand. The EMPs were usually referred to as the \\"Erma‚ÄìVollmer\\" in French documents. The French tested the weapons and decided to adopt them for their own service. A provisional manual was printed in French as Provisoire sur le pistolet-mitrailleur Erma ‚Äì Vollmer de 9mm, issued on December 26, 1939 and updated on January 6, 1940. However, the French had obtained only some 1,540 suitable magazines for these guns, so only 700-800 EMPs were actually distributed to the French forces, mostly to the Mobile Gendarmerie. After the Germans conquered France, some EMPs armed the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, which eventually became part of the SS Charlemagne division. This division was practically destroyed in February 1945 in Eastern Prussia, now part of Poland. Numerous EMPs have been found in the last-stand battlefields of the SS Charlemagne division; most of these guns lack any German military stamps or marks.The Erma EMP submachine guns ‚Äì Translation to English of text from Martin Helebrant's Samopal MP38 a MP40, Nakladatelstvi Elka Press, at mp40.nl The EMPs which arrived in German hands via the French route were given the (Fremdger√§t) designation 740(f). The Yugoslav purchased EMPs were used by both the Partisans and the Chetniks. In Francoist Spain, the EMP, chambered in the 9mm Largo cartridge, was locally produced until the mid-1950s. It was designated Model 1941/44 or \\"subfusil Coru√±a\\". It performed poorly during the Ifni War.  Design  Its arming lever is on the right. The magazine housing, which is on the left, is slightly canted forwards to assist in feeding ammunition. The weapon could be fired either in semi-automatic or fully automatic modes.  Influence  The final development at Erma is known as the EMP 36. This can be considered an intermediate model between the EMP and the MP38. Although many details of the mechanism were changed from the EMP, it retained Vollmer's telescoping main operating spring basically unchanged. On the exterior, the most obvious differences are that the magazine housing was now almost vertical, although still canted slightly to the left and forward. The solid wood stock was replaced with a wood frame and a folding metal butt. It is not entirely clear who designed the EMP 36, although Berthold Geipel himself is usually credited. Apparently, the features of the new design were the result of another secret contract with the German army. The EMP's telescopic cylinder return spring guide was retained for the Maschinenpistole 38.

Sugarloaf refers to a landmark mountain in Heber Springs in Cleburne County, Arkansas, USA. Sugarloaf Mountain1 This popular climbing destination rises above the fertile valley just east of the city of Heber Springs. It formed as an erosional remnant by the Little Red River (Arkansas). It stands as a monument to the eons of time when the river was patiently carving out the valley from the surrounding hills. Why the sandstone formation has held firm on top of the long familiar landmark is a question that geologists can explain. Because the huge rocks at the top of the formation lie in flat layers and were not folded by continental drift, they cap the mountain on which they lie. Through the centuries, less resistant units of sandstone, siltstone and shale eroded away, leaving the atoka formation which the white man called Sugar Loaf. Exactly where the mountain first got its name is a question nobody can answer today. The Indians called it Tonawanda or Ton-Wan-Dah. And from the top of Ton-Wan-Dah with its sparse growth of wind-stunted cedars and gnarled scrub oak they could see for miles in every direction. The Indian name, as tradition has it, was that of a family of renowned arrow makers. An abundance of flint chips and imperfect arrow heads remained on the mountaintop long after the white man arrived to attest to this storied past. The earliest white settlers who pushed through the dense forest must have called it Sugar Loaf because of the resemblance in shape to the loaves of unrefined sugar in use at that time. The survey party that was surveying the Louisiana Purchase in 1819 took note of the feature \\"encountered Sugar Lofe (sic), a well-known landmark\\". Presumably Indians and early day travelers on the nearby Little Red River had used it as a landmark. The name of the landmark became the name of the springs to the west and the community that developed there. The community name was later changed to Heber Springs. Sugar Loaf Mountain is located on a section line, and consequently land transactions have always been conducted in two parcels. For several years, beginning in 1901, the Lucas brothers, Creighton and Richard, maintained a mining claim on the north side of Sugar Loaf Mountain, but apparently no ore or oil was discovered. In 1922 Dr. L.E. Robbins of Heber Springs bought the on the south of the mountain along with other land from Richard R. Lucas. In 1951 he acquired a clear title to the on the north side by patent from the U.S. government. In the same year of the patent, Dr. Robbins and his wife Dotte dedicated the to the town of Heber Springs in a 99 year lease. The lease specified that the land was to be used as a public park and picnic ground, the town should have the right to build barbecue grills, tables and benches and no lumber should be cut except as prescribed by the Arkansas Forestry Commission and then only by the grantors or their heirs. So the central picnic spot of Cleburne County, long treated as public property, was given to the people to use and enjoy. Climbing Sugarloaf has been a very popular pastime for generations of residents of Heber Springs and surrounding areas. It was an easy day trip for young people before the advent of the automobile. The increase of tourism due to the Greers Ferry Dam and lake has spread the popularity of the Sugarloaf adventure far beyond the local area. There have even been weddings performed on the top level. The land parcel containing the Sugarloaf mountain was obtained by Arkansas State University Beebe for the ASU-Heber Springs campus in 2005. The first phase of construction of the campus was completed in 2007. In 2007 the Sugarloaf Heritage Council was formed. The founders were Arkansas State University (ASU) Vice-Chancellor Dr. Diane Tiner, Heber Springs Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Jo Price, Sun-Times Editor Randy Kemp, Heber Springs Mayor Jackie McPherson, Joe Rath, Frank Barton, Clay McCastlain (ASU), Jeff Baggett (ASU), ASU Development Director Carol Johnson, and Joe Rath. The group spent many days rappelling down the side of the sheer rock to remove the extensive graffiti. Once complete with the help of over 200 volunteers, 600 pounds of trash was removed, and three trails were constructed; the Tonowanda Base Trail, the Summit Trail, and Hidden Pond Trail. In 2017 the Wildlife Trail will be completed and will connect to the Sulfur Creek Trail. Benches were constructed and placed along the trails by more volunteers, and by Eagle Scout Projects. The parking lot is now paved, and the entrance is enhanced with a beautiful green space with picnic tables. Sugarloaf Mountain is called the Jewel of Heber Springs. The island Sugar Loaf In the upper section of Greers Ferry Lake is another \\"Sugar Loaf\\" mesa that rises as an island in the lake. Though accessible only by boat, it is also a popular hiking destination, with a well-maintained trail: \\"The Sugar Loaf Mountain Island National Nature Trail,\\" a 1.5-mile hike that reaches 1001 feet. above sea level, providing impressive views of the surrounding lake and countryside. Unlike the landlocked Sugar Loaf, the climb on the island peak is aided by a wooden staircase. Like many other locations on the lake, Sugar Loaf island is embellished by a nearby campground and boat ramp (on the lake's main shore) maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

It was founded in the late 1980s by Elgin James in Boston, Massachusetts, evolving out of the hardcore punk scene and in particular the straight edge subculture. While originally having a reputation for fighting against Neo-Nazis and racist groups, in later years FSU members were accused of unprovoked violence and intimidation tactics. The group is classified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a street gang.  History  FSU grew out of the hardcore punk scene Boston, Massachusetts in the late 1980s. The group consisted primarily of members of the straight edge subculture, and while people of all races were allowed to join, members were predominantly White. The group is credited with expelling White supremacists, Neo-Nazi and other racist gangs from punk concerts in Boston in the late 1980s. According to Rolling Stone, FSU started out as \\"just another local [hardcore punk] crew\\", which were typically \\"fueled by young male aggression\\". According to Elgin James, one of the founding members, FSU \\"never really had a political agenda. It was more of a visceral reaction: ‚ÄòYou're gonna call me a nigger? I'm gonna bash your face in with this fucking brick'.\\" After successfully eliminating the presence of Neo-Nazis from punk concerts in Boston, Elgin and other FSU members then turned their attention on drug dealers, robbing them and giving half their money to charity. FSU is said to have \\"fizzled out\\" after racists became less prominent in the hardcore scene, and has been described as reemerging in the mid 1990s with no clear agenda. The group began to get a reputation for becoming \\"the intimidating, bullying presence they once fought against\\". They were accused of violently confronting anyone they believed had crossed them, and of taking over and policing concerts. FSU officially stands for \\"Friends Stand United\\", however, in the punk scene it was more frequently known as \\"Fuck Shit Up\\". By the early 2000s, there were FSU chapters in Philadelphia, Chicago, Arizona, Los Angeles, Seattle, upstate New York and New Jersey, and they were considered to have about 200 members. In 2004, FSU produced an official documentary film entitled Boston Beatdown Volume II; they previously released an underground video entitled Boston Beatdown. The film interviews members including James and discusses the group's formation. According to Rolling Stone, the film contains \\"disturbing footage of violent beatings in and around Boston clubs, ostensibly by members of FSU\\". The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which classified FSU as a street gang in 2009, states that James and other FSU members \\"boast\\" about their violent methods in the film and are shown repeatedly assaulting people at hardcore punk rock concerts and on Boston streets. James has stated that FSU is different from other outlaw organizations as they are not concerned with profiting from activities. Any involvement with selling guns, drugs or prostitution will result in members being removed from the group. He insisted the group was a collection of individuals, though was described as the closest person they have to a leader. Throughout 2005, FSU members were accused of using violence and intimidation to control hardcore punk events in Seattle on several occasions, including threatening the band Dangers over a song they had written which criticized FSU's violence and intimidation tactics; Dangers cancelled one of their concerts following threats from FSU over the song. In response to these incidents, a group of Seattle venues, bands and bookers were reported to be discussing ways to resist the group; there were calls for a complete boycott. In February 2005, six men with ties to FSU, including the president of the upstate New York chapter, were arrested following a thirty- six-year-old man being bashed to death at a concert in New York; charges were later dropped against three of the members. That December, an FSU member was shot and killed in Arizona. According to the Arizona Daily Star, armed FSU members had invaded a concert and attacked patrons, one of whom ran to his car where he retrieved a firearm and shot an FSU member who had been chasing him. In March 2006, a Seattle police spokesperson stated there were three incidents of FSU members attacking strangers for no apparent reason in recent months, and several complaints of FSU members assaulting people in a local club. In March 2006, police searched 24 men standing outside a Seattle rock club, some wearing FSU clothing, and arrested four for carrying weapons. In 2007, FSU member Alex Franklin was arrested and charged with the murder of James Morrison, following a confrontation at a punk concert in New Jersey. There is no clear agreement over the cause of the confrontation, though some media reports claimed it was due to one of Franklin's friends wearing a shirt with a Confederate flag on it. Elgin James left FSU in 2007, stating he'd \\"been thinking a lot about violence and responsibility\\" since being interviewed regarding his involvement with the group by Rolling Stone earlier that year. At the time he was the last original founding member, with previous members having left and moved on to motorcycle gangs like the Outlaws and the Mongols.Catalano, Debbie, ‚ÄúElgin James: Truth and Fiction‚Äù, Soundcheck magazine (November 2003), pp. 14-16 In 2011, James was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for attempting to extort $5,000 from an unidentified member of the band Mest in 2005. The Mest member had been targeted and beaten by FSU several times, and Elgin approached him saying the attacks could stop if he made a $5,000 donation to FSU. Upon being sentenced, Elgin stated he had faced his \\"day of reckoning. ...

She disappeared on her first patrol in May 1915, and was the first of her class to be lost. UB-3 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November. UB-3 was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. She was launched and commissioned as SM UB-3 in March 1915.\\"SM\\" stands for \\"Seiner Majest√§t\\" () and combined with the U for Unterseeboot would be translated as His Majesty's Submarine. UB-3 was broken into sections and shipped by rail to the Austro-Hungarian port of Pola in April for reassembly. She officially joined the Pola Flotilla on 1 May and departed on her first patrol for temporary duty in Turkey on 23 May, and was never seen again. A postwar German study concluded that UB-3 was likely the victim of an unexplained technical problem in the absence of any minefields or enemy action.  Design and construction  After the German Army's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow environment off Flanders.Miller, pp. 46‚Äì47.Karau, p. 48. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes.A further refinement of the design‚Äîreplacing the torpedo tubes with mine chutes but changing little else‚Äîevolved into the Type UC I coastal minelaying submarine. See: Miller, p. 458. UB-3 was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines‚Äînumbered to ‚Äîordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.Williamson, p. 12. UB-3 was laid down by Germaniawerft on 3 November and was launched on 5 March 1915. As built, UB-3 was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Daimler 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, UB-3 was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds. UB-3 was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. UB-3s complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.Karau, p. 49.  Service career  The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-3 on 14 March under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Siegfried Schmidt, a 27-year- old, first-time U-boat skipper,Schmidt was in the Navy's April 1906 cadet class with 34 other future U-boat captains, including Wilhelm Marschall, Matthias Graf von Schmettow, Max Viebeg, and Erwin Wa√üner. See: and underwent trials in German home waters. As one of the UB I boats selected for Mediterranean duty, UB-3 was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. UB-3 was shipped to the port of Pola,Messimer, pp. 126‚Äì27. site of ally Austria‚ÄìHungary's main naval base,Halpern, p. 384. on 15 April. After UB-3s parts arrived at Pola, it took about two weeks to assemble them. UB-3 joined the Pola Flotilla () on 1 May. By late May, UB-3 had made her way down the Adriatic to the Austro‚ÄìHungarian port of Cattaro, the base from which most boats of the Pola Flotilla actually operated.Although the flotilla was based in Pola, boats of the flotilla operated out of Cattaro which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean. German U-boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs. See: Halpern, p. 384. For her first patrol, UB-3 was loaded with ammunition for Turkish forces at ƒ∞zmir, Turkey.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 71. Because of her limited range, UB-3 was towed by the light cruiser SMS Novara of the Austro-Hungarian NavyBendert, Die UB-Boote der Kaiserlichen Marine, 1914-1918. Eins√§tze, Erfolge, Schicksal p. 30. through the Straits of Otranto and cast off near the island of K√©rkira. UB-3s planned route was south of the Ionian Islands, around the Peloponnese, through the Cyclades, north around Khios and Karaburun, and into the Gulf of ƒ∞zmir. If all went well, UB-3 would have arrived at ƒ∞zmir on 28 or 29 May with about half her fuel left. The Germans received a garbled radio message from UB-3 when she was about from ƒ∞zmir, but were unable to completely understand it. No trace of UB-3 has ever been found. UB-3 was the first of the UB I boats to be lost during the war.Tarrant, p. 24. The first UB I boats entered service in March 1915. The list presented by Tarrant shows UB-3 was sunk three months before sister ship UB-4. A postwar German study concluded that UB-3s loss was probably the result of some unexplained technical problem, because there were no minefields along UB-3s route and no record of any attacks against U-boats in the area. British records, and some sources based on them, give the particulars of UB-3s demise as being in the North Sea on 24 April 1916, which authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast assert was actually the fate of . They also point out that UB-3 had gone missing nearly a year before UB-3s supposed sinking in the North Sea.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 91.

Its mission: to \\"commemorate throughout Canada the development of electronic communications\\". In the ensuing years, the project moved forward slowly, perhaps because broadcasters were too preoccupied with the challenges of the present and the future to their industry to be able to properly reflect on or to chronicle the past. But, all the while, a search was carried on to find the ideal vehicle with which to fulfill the mission. It was not until the potential of the Internet was revealed and realized that the ideal vehicle was found and two veteran Canadian broadcasters became involved in CCF.

It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms, and to replace the medieval inquisition which was under Vatican control. Spain's diplomatic mission in Rome grew out of the Inquisition and exploration in the New World. Its first ambassador, Gonzalo de Beteta, was appointed in 1480. This established the World¬¥s oldest permanent diplomatic mission in History. The mission resulted in important projects of cooperation between the 2 countries.

Relations with the recent Zapatero's PSOE government were strained because of legislation allowing for same-sex marriage and liberalisation of abortion, the end of religious education in public schools, and general political support for secularism. The government valued the heritage of the Spanish Republicans of the 19th and 20th centuries, many of which were strongly anticlerical, especially during the Spanish Civil War. It also questioned the role of the Spanish monarchy in national politics. This contrasts with previous Spanish administrations, many of which had been keen on promoting Spain's historic Catholic culture and identity, such as under Francisco Franco, for example. Relations were also good under Partido Popular (PP)'s Jose Maria Aznar and Mariano Rajoy.

Peter Blecha accounts his Dave Lewis Combo as \\"Seattle's first significant African American 1950s rock and roll band\\"Peter Blecha, \\"Dave Lewis\\", Seattle Metropolitan, December 2008, p. 74. and Lewis himself as \\"the singularly most significant figure on the Pacific Northwest's nascent rhythm & blues scene in the 1950s and 1960s.\\"Peter Blecha, Lewis, Dave (1938‚Äì1998): Father of Northwest Rock, HistoryLink, July 22, 2008. Accessed online February 20, 2009. Life and early career The Texas-born Lewis came to the Pacific Northwest with his family during World War II. There was music in his background: his father, David Lewis, Sr., was an accomplished amateur guitarist, and his mother Bertha Lewis was similarly talented on piano. The family moved first to seek work in the navy town of Bremerton, Washington, across Puget Sound from Seattle, where they settled in the segregated Sinclair Heights housing projects. One of their neighbors was the young Quincy Jones, who took some music lessons from David Sr. The Lewis and Jones families both eventually moved to Seattle, where they lived about five blocks apart from one another in the Central District, the center of African-American life in Seattle at the time. His father worked as a fabricator at Boeing and also pulled shifts in a barber shop. Lewis tried both guitar and piano, but definitely gravitated toward the latter, especially after hearing Ray Charles, who was launching his performing career in Seattle in the late 1940s. Lewis's first performing group was a doo-wop vocal group called the Five Checks, formed to enter a talent show held at Edmond Meany Jr. High School (now Edmond S. Meany Middle School). They went on to perform at schools around Seattle, often for audiences who had never heard anything of the sort, at least not in live performance. Barney Hilliard, former member of the Dave Lewis Combo, 2018. As a student at Seattle's Garfield High School Lewis formed the combo that would bring him to local prominence. George Griffin from his doo-wop group played drums; Barney Hilliard and J. B. Allen both played saxophone; Jack Grey played upright bass, and Al Aquino rounded out the group on guitar. Starting off at teenage sock hops and house parties, they soon graduated to being an opening act for touring R&B; acts when they played Seattle's downtown Palomar Theater (then at the corner of Third and University, now replaced by a multi-story parking garage). The Dave Lewis Combo opened for, among others Sugar Pie DeSanto, Sugar Chile Robinson, Nellie Lutcher, and Wild Bill Davis. In the summer of 1956, Lewis still had one more year to complete at Seattle's Franklin High School, but his combo was the hottest item in the region. They toured the Pacific Northwest as the opening act for a leg of a Bill Haley & His Comets tour. This led to similar opportunities with Ray Charles, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Platters, Ike and Tina Turner, the Drifters, Roy Orbison, and Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps. In summer 1957, Lewis and his combo settled in for a long tenure as the house band at the leading Seattle R&B; club, Birdland (22nd and Madison), where they popularized the song Louie Louie, which would become strongly associated with the region. By this time, Al Aquino and Jack Grey had left the band, replaced by Bud Brown on guitar and Chuck Whittaker on electric bass (replacing Grey's upright acoustic). On several occasions the teenaged Jimi Hendrix‚Äîthen \\"Jimmy\\" Hendrix‚Äîsat in on jam sessions there, but Lewis's audience found him undanceable. Later members of the Combo were Jerry Allen (guitar) and Carlos Ward (saxophone). Role in desegregation Lewis's broad popularity played a significant role in the desegregation of the Seattle music scene. At the time Lewis began his professional career, Seattle still had two musician's union locals, AFM No. 76 for whites and AFM No. 493 for blacks. Lewis's combo became the first African- American band to play frequently on traditionally white turf, including downtown clubs, University of Washington fraternities, and even suburban venues. When Local 76 complained about Lewis getting a gig at the popular Parker's Ballroom on Aurora Avenue, owner Dick Parker told them that if they made him choose between booking Lewis's combo and being able to book Local 76 bands, he'd choose Lewis. On January 14, 1958 the two Seattle locals merged. 1960s success In 1962, taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the Century 21 Exposition (the Seattle world's fair), Lewis put together a new band. J. B. Allen remained from the old group; the new band members were guitarist Jim Manolides and drummer Don \\"Candido\\" Mallory. The new group took over from Manolides' old group the Frantics as the house band at Dave's Fifth Avenue near the fairgrounds. Shortly after the end of the fair, Lewis switched from piano to Hammond B-3 organ, and formed a new trio with guitarist Joe Johansen and drummer Dickey Enfield (who would be replaced in 1966 by Dean Hodges). His new trio scored minor hits with \\"David's Mood (Part 2)\\" (1963) and \\"Little Green Thing\\" (1964), both of which were heavily covered by other Pacific Northwest bands. By the mid-1960s, though, Lewis pretty much gave up touring, settling instead into a long series of local club gigs that lasted into the early 1970s. Declining years Although Lewis in his years of success was not known to be a drug user \\"beyond an occasional reefer,\\" he was busted for drug possession in 1975, receiving probation. He attempted a comeback in the 1980s with the Paramount Orchestra, an attempt at a house band for Seattle's landmark Paramount Theatre, where his brother Ulysses Lewis was one of the partners in the management firm at the time. The \\"grandiose\\" project was not notably successful. Furthermore, Lewis got into increasingly serious drug problems, leading him to get involved with a drugstore robbery, for which he was convicted and served two years in prison. Lewis did some performing in his later years, including playing in a 1987 Northwest Rock reunion concert at the Seattle Center Coliseum, and was inducted into the Northwest Area Music Association's Hall of Fame in 1989. Lewis died of cancer March 13, 1998. Some of his recordings were finally reissued in CD form in 2006.

Its founder, David G. Seixas (1788‚Äì1864), was a Philadelphia crockery maker-dealer who became concerned with the plight of impoverished deaf children that he observed on the city's streets.Gannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage‚ÄìA Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, p. 17, 20 (PDF )(PDF ) The current school building is listed by the National Register of Historic Places, and two former campuses are similarly recognized. It is one of four approved chartered schools‚Äîalong with the Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, the Overbrook School for the Blind, the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf‚Äîin Pennsylvania. History In 1819, Seixas began bringing deaf youngsters into his home to provide them with food, clothing and instruction, all at his expense. More space became needed to accommodate additional children as Seixas' humanitarian efforts became known, so he rented an office at the southeast corner of Eleventh and High (later Market) Streets to serve as a school. In 1821, prominent Philadelphia citizens decided to help Seixas by incorporating a charitable society: the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb. The organization was chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as \\"an asylum and school in the city of Philadelphia, where the children of the rich, for a moderate compensation, and of the poor, gratuitously, laboring under the privation of the faculty of speech, are maintained and educated.\\" (Act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, February 8, 1821) The state also provided financial assistance. Episcopal Bishop William White served as the school's president until his death in 1836. University of the Arts. The number of deaf children needing special education increased so much that a much larger school‚Äîmore accurately, an asylum‚Äîwas soon needed. This became the stately Greek Revival structure that still stands at the northwest corner Broad and Pine Streets. Completed in 1826 and later incorporating two additions, this building is an excellent example of major works by three of America's most important 19th-century architects: John Haviland, William Strickland and Frank Furness. When the Pennsylvania School moved to a campus in Philadelphia's Mount Airy neighborhood in 1892-1893, the Broad and Pine building was purchased by the predecessor of Philadelphia's University of the Arts. The structure, now known as Dorrance Hamilton Hall, is the oldest extant edifice on Broad Street. Since 1984, the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf has been located in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, occupying several buildings of the Old Germantown Academy site at 100 West School House Lane. Spring Garden College bought the Mt. Airy campus in 1985 and then closed in the early 1990s.Spring Garden College History, accessed January 2, 2013. The institution presently serves students aged 3 to 18 in preschool through high school classes. As one of four private state-chartered schools, along with the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, which recently took over the Scranton School for Deaf and Hard-of- Hearing Children (formerly known as Scranton State School for the Deaf), the Pennsylvania School is reimbursed for most of its operating expenses by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and eligible youngsters attend tuition-free. The school also depends on charitable contributions. A resource and service center for deaf and hard of hearing adults called the Center for Community and Professional Services also operates on the school's campus. Under the title Pennsylvania Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, the former campus at 7500 Germantown Avenue was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 9, 1985. The 1826 Broad Street building is a contributing building in the Broad Street Historic District added to the NRHP in 1984. The current buildings are part of the Old Germantown Academy, added to the NRHP in 1972. Notable students Artist Albert Newsam attended the school, starting in 1820.

It is the second tallest building in Belgium, and has the most office space of any building in Belgium.Finance Tower at Emporis  Height classification  At the time of its construction, this skyscraper was the second tallest building in Belgium after the Tour du Midi. The height of the building is 145 meters, and it has 36 floors.  Location  The Finance Tower is situated to the crossroads of the boulevard of the botanical Garden (Boulevard du Jardin Botanique / Kruidtuinlaan) and the Royal Street (Rue Royale / Koningsstraat). It is served by many public transit systems, including the Botanique/Kruidtuin metro station and Brussels-Central and Brussels-North railway stations.  Art  L'√Çme Sentinelle sculpture by Nat Neujean. Right in front of the Finance Tower one finds the sculpture L'√Çme Sentinelle (by Nat Neujean) of two females embracing. In individualistic Belgian fashion, this is rather an evocative and erotically-themed sculpture. One of the two women is more classically feminine in appearance, the other looks more like a man, though one quickly sees she also female. The pose is enigmatic, with the shorter-haired woman firmly grasping the wrist of the longer-haired woman behind her back, almost wrestling her into submission, while both look away from each other despite being nude and intimate.  History   Purpose  The Finance Tower is part of a wider body: the Administrative City of the State. One objective was to group together the administrations of the State in order to increase productivity and to reduce the functioning wastes. The site is preferred because of its ease of access, most notably with the proximity of central train station. On top of this, the works of the North-South connection made the neighbourhood lifeless, and it was necessary to recreate a liaison between the upper and lower city.  Construction  The tower is located on a site with a 13-metre difference between the highest and lowest altitudes. Producing the preliminary documents took nearly four years, from 1968 to 1972. Searches were performed down to a depth of 26 metres. The building of the foundations was made difficult by the presence of a water-logged clay terrain as well as by the tunnel of the North- South connection. Budget restrictions slowed down the construction; work was practically paralysed from 1974 to 1978. The works resumed in 1978. Major work was finally finished in February 1981 but it was the end of 1983 before the tower at last opened its doors. Its external elevator core was intended to have had a marble facade, but this was scrapped because of the high cost.  Renovation  The Finance Tower was involved in a large-scale renovation between January 1, 2005 and 2008. The plan comes about it back to the office of architects of Maurice Mottle, It involved replacing the old facade with a light blue and white curtain wall, removal of all asbestos, the dismantling of the external elevator core and the building of new elevators inside the building. The office space lost by this move is compensated for by a new 11-storey building constructed to the east of the tower. The renovated building provides office space for 4,600 workers, an increase from the 3,200 prior to renovation. The antenna, which is mounted on top of the tower, serves the two Belgian national television stations and is used only for digital broadcast.

Gonzalo Salvad√≥rez (or Salvadores) (died 6 January 1083), \\"called Cuatro Manos (‚Äòfour hands‚Äô) on account of his great valour\\", was one of the most powerful Castilian noblemen of his era, a kinsman of the Lara family, and by tradition, descendant of the Counts of Castile. He was a son of Salvador Gonz√°lez and brother of √Ålvaro Salvad√≥rez, with whom he often figures in contemporary documentation. His family's area of influence was Bureba. Gonzalo is first recorded as an adult when he witnessed a charter with his father and uncle, Munio (Mu√±o) Gonz√°lez, in 1056, at the court of Ferdinand I. In the next reign, he was a frequent subscriber to the charters of--and attendee at the court of--Sancho II. He was ruling Lara in 1072, when Sancho granted the citizens of Lara the right to pilgrimage to San Mill√°n de Cogolla.This charter refers to comes Gonzalvo Salvatorez (count Gonzalo Salvad√≥rez) as qui Laram dominabatur ([he] who dominates Lara). He witnessed donations to San Mill√°n in 1070 and 1082 (twice).Gonzalo is referred to as \\"count\\" in the 1082 charters: comite Gonzalvo Salvatoriz and, confusingly, comite Gundissalvo et frater eius Gonzalvo Salvatoris. In the 1070 charter he is only Gonzalvo Salvadorez. He and his uncle Munio were one of the first Castilian magnates to support Alfonso VI after the death of Sancho (1072), and Gonzalo attained the rank of count (comes) in 1074. Gonzalo, Munio, and Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar (El Cid) were the only Castilian magnates to figure prominently in royal actions outside of Castile. In total, Gonzalo confirmed some nine charters of Sancho II and eleven by Alfonso. Gonzalo negotiated with King Sancho IV of Navarre the safe passage of the pilgrims of Lara to the shrine of San Mill√°n in 1073, while Sancho and Alfonso were at war. In December 1082 Albofalac, the governor of Rueda de Jal√≥n, made a pronunciamiento in a favour of Yusuf al-Muzaffar, the imprisoned brother of al-Muqtadir, recently deceased ruler of Zaragoza, and rebelled against al-Mu'tamin, al-Muqtadir's son and successor. At the same time Ibn al-Royolo, who had brought Denia to al-Muqtadir in 1076, was now suspected of intriguing with Alfonso VI against al-Mu'tamin. Further, a recently failed embassy led by Sisnando Davidiz to the court of Zaragoza may have warmed Alfonso to the invitation of Albofalac to take part in his revolt, which he eventually requested. Alfonso sent an army under Gonzalo and Ramiro Garc√©s, the younger brother of Sancho IV of Navarre. Gonzalo and Ramiro held talks with Yusuf, now free (Albofalac had been his jailer), who may have urged them to request the king's presence. Alfonso did appear, but only for a short while. After his departure, Yusuf suddenly died. Albofalac then invited Alfonso to take possession of his castle of Rueda, and the king sent Gonzalo and Ramiro under a safe conduct. Immediately before setting out on his final expedition, Gonzalo made a donation to the monastery long patronised by his family, San Salvador de O√±a. The act of donation‚Äîwhich reads almost like a will‚Äîis a \\"vivid statement of the aristocratic piety of the eleventh century\\": > I Count Gonzalo, in readiness for battle against the Moors with my lord, > grant and concede to God and to the monastery of O√±a where my forebears > rest, in order that I may be remembered there for evermore . . . [a list of > properties and churches] . . . If I should meet with death among the Moors, > may my soul be with Christ; and let my body be borne to O√±a and buried there > with my kinsfolk, together with [the gifts of] 1600 gold pieces [metcales], > and three of my noble horses and two mules, and from my wardrobe two silken > robes and three of shot-silk taffeta, and two vessels of silver . . . And if > my vassals and retainers do not so bear me [to O√±a] in the event of my > death, they are nothing worth, like the traitor who kills his lord, because > I made them rich and powerful. When they and their men entered the castle, they were massacred by the garrison, who pelted them with stones. The Annales Compostellani place the death of Gundisalvus comes ‚Ä¶ apud Rodam (Count Gonzalo ‚Ä¶ by Rueda) in 1084. The disaster is also placed in 1084 by the Chronicon Iriense, Chronicon Burgense, and Annales Complutenses. The date of the Historia Roderici, however is confirmed by the Chronica Naierensis and has the support of Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, Antonio Ubieto Arteta, R. A. Fletcher, and B. F. Reilly. Coat of arms on the lid of the sepulchre of Count Gonzalo and his brother Munio at the monastery of San Salvador de O√±a Gonzalo was buried at O√±a as he had requested, and where his ancestors continued to be buried. Gonzalo's first wife was Elvira D√≠az, daughter of Diego √Ålvarez and sister of Ticlo, wife of √ç√±igo L√≥pez, who bore him six children:Perhaps only five since Munia and Due√±a, as mentioned in a charter in Valvanera, could have been only one person, Muniadona, or Mayor, who Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n 2003 believes was the wife of Pelayo Pel√°ez and mother of count Gonzalo Pel√°ez. Ticlo, jointly with Diego Gonz√°lez, Gonzalo Salvad√≥rez, do√±a Elvira and children (Goto, Tota, Moma, Duenna, Garsea, and Gudesteus) donated to the Monastery of Valvanera on 25 July 1074 the third part of their threshing land in Herreruela. Goto, Toda, Munia, Due√±a, Garc√≠a, and Gustio. His second wife, Sancha S√°nchez, daughter of Sancho Macer√°tiz, bore him two: count G√≥mez Gonz√°lez, Gonzalo's eventual heir and the premier noble and one-time suitor of queen Urraca of Le√≥n, and Fernando. Goto married Fernando D√≠az and was dead by July 1087, when, as the executor of her will, he made a donation to San Salvador de O√±a of some land in Hermosilla that she had inherited from her father and uncle √Ålvaro Salvad√≥rez.

This university, also known simply as La Academia (The Academy) is accredited in the areas of Institutional Management and Undergraduate Studies by the National Commission on Accreditation, an organization that ensures the quality of higher education in Chile, for a period of 3 years from December 2008 and December 2011. It, along with the Andr√©s Bello and Diego Portales University was awarded research funds from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) program's regular contest of 2009. The University now offers 21 courses leading to diploma and degree graduates, special programs and 9 master's programs in the areas of Social Sciences, Education, Arts and Culture, State, Economy and Management, and also a PhD in Education with twenty years of experience.  History  The university began in 1975 when Cardinal Ra√∫l Silva Henr√≠quez (SDB) prompted the establishment of the Academy of Christian Humanism, a center for studies in a framework of freedom and pluralism. This institution has enabled a large group of intellectuals in Chile, especially in the field of social sciences, an area for creating and disseminating knowledge on the political, economic, social and cultural of Chile under the Pinochet's military dictatorship. The Academy of Christian Humanism University was founded in 1988 as a university within the framework of human values from various strands of social thought, with a decisive role in the formation of new generations of professionals in Chile. This has been setting up work areas, which integrates the teaching, research, extension and interdisciplinary studies of the phenomena characteristic of contemporary society. This University has been defined as university of academic excellence, that definition is supported by the high quality of its teachers and researchers, and as an open space for discussion and reflection. This position is reflected in the promotion of critical thinking and divergent, through constructive dialogue.

Career Born in Bridgwater, Somerset, Dukes was educated at Caterham School and graduated with an M.D. thesis entitled Effect of severe haemorrhage and shock on the condition of the blood from the University of Edinburgh in 1914. His field of choice was pathology and he would make many great contributions to the world of medicine over the course of his career. He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps that was attached to the Rifle Brigade during World War I and was awarded the OBE for his services. After the war's end he became a demonstrator in bacteriology at University College in London, and in 1922, was the first pathologist to join the staff of St Mark's Hospital. It was there that he began his recognized studies on the pathology of colon cancer. He wrote several books based on his findings. A meticulous researcher who took personal pleasure in the many cases in which his findings helped patients with colon cancer, Dukes, apparently in accordance to his humble Quaker faith, refused all honours despite the wishes of his former colleagues and lived quietly at his home in Wimbledon until his death at the age of 86. He was the younger brother of British playwright Ashley Dukes and MI6 agent Sir Paul Dukes.

Since H. Otley Beyer first proposed his wave migration theory, numerous scholars have approached the question of how, when and why humans first came to the Philippines. The current scientific consensus favors the \\"Out of Taiwan\\" model, which broadly match linguistic, genetic, archaeological, and cultural evidence.  Older theories   Beyer's Wave Migration Theory  The most widely known theory of the prehistoric peopling of the Philippines is that of H. Otley Beyer, founder of the Anthropology Department of the University of the Philippines. Heading that department for 40 years, Professor Beyer became the unquestioned expert on Philippine prehistory, exerting early leadership in the field and influencing the first generation of Filipino historians and anthropologists, archaeologists, paleontologists, geologists, and students the world over., citing Beyer Memorial Issue on the Prehistory of the Philippines in Philippine Studies, Vol. 15:No. 1 (January 1967). According to Dr. Beyer, the ancestors of the Filipinos came in different \\"waves of migration\\", as follows:. :# \\"Dawn Man\\", a cave-man type who was similar to Java man, Peking Man, and other Asian Homo erectus of 250,000 years ago. :# The aboriginal pygmy group, the Negritos, who arrived between 25,000 and 30,000 years ago via land bridges. :# The seafaring tool-using Indonesian group who arrived about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago and were the first immigrants to reach the Philippines by sea. :# The seafaring, more civilized Malays who brought the Iron Age culture and were the real colonizers and dominant cultural group in the pre-Hispanic Philippines. There is no definite evidence, archaeological or historical, to support this migration theory, and the passage of time has made that more unlikely. Key issues with this theory include Beyer's reliance on 19th-century theories of progressive evolution and migratory diffusion that have been shown in other contexts to be overly simplistic and unreliable and his reliance on incomplete archaeological findings and conjecture.. His claims that the Malays were the original settlers of the lowland regions and the dominant cultural transmitter now seem untenable, no subsequent evidence has emerged to support his \\"Dawn Man\\", and improved bathymetric soundings have established that there was almost certainly not a land bridge to Sundaland, although most of the islands were connected and could be accessed across the Mindoro Strait and Sibutu Passage. Writing in 1994, Philippine historian William Scott concluded that \\"it is probably safe to say that no anthropologist accepts the Beyer Wave Migration Theory today.\\"Scott, William H. Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society, p. 11\\\\. Manila University Press (Manila), 1994. . Accessed 14 May 2009. A German scientist who has studied the Philippines, Fritjof Voss, has even argued that the present soundings are probably a generous overestimate of the earlier situation, as the Philippines have steadily risen over known geologic history.  Core Population Theory  The Sahul Shelf and the Sunda Shelf today. The area in between is called \\"Wallacea\\". A less rigid version of the earlier wave migration theory is the Core Population Theory first proposed by anthropologist Felipe Landa Jocano of the University of the Philippines. This theory holds that there weren't clear discrete waves of migration. Instead it suggests early inhabitants of Southeast Asia were of the same ethnic group with similar culture, but through a gradual process over time driven by environmental factors, differentiated themselves from one another. Jocano contends that what fossil evidence of ancient men show is that they not only migrated to the Philippines, but also to New Guinea, Borneo, and Australia. He says that there is no way of determining if they were Negritos at all. However, what is sure is that there is evidence the Philippines was inhabited tens of thousands of years ago. In 1962, a skull cap and a portion of a jaw, presumed to be those of a human being, were found in Tabon Cave in Palawan. The nearby charcoal from cooking fires have been dated to years ago. While Palawan was connected directly to Sundaland during the last ice age (and separated from the rest of the Philippines by the Mindoro Strait), Callao Man's still-older remains were discovered in northern Luzon. Some have argued that this may show settlement of the Philippines earlier than that of the Malay Peninsula. Jocano further believes that the present Filipinos are products of the long process of cultural evolution and movement of people. This not only holds true for Filipinos, but for the Indonesians and the Malays of Malaysia, as well. No group among the three is culturally or genetically dominant. Hence, Jocano says that it is not correct to attribute the Filipino culture as being Malayan in orientation. According to Jocano's findings, the people of the prehistoric islands of Southeast Asia were of the same population as the combination of human evolution that occurred in the islands of Southeast Asia about 1.9 million years ago. The claimed evidence for this is fossil material found in different parts of the region and the movements of other people from the Asian mainland during historic times. He states that these ancient men cannot be categorized under any of the historically identified ethnic groups (Malays, Indonesians, and Filipinos) of today. Other prominent anthropologists like Robert Bradford Fox, Alfredo E. Evangelista, Jesus Peralta, Zeus A. Salazar, and Ponciano L. Bennagen agreed with Jocano. Some still preferred Beyer's theory as the more acceptable model, including anthropologist E. Arsenio Manuel. Modern theories Best-fit genomic mixture proportions of Austronesians in Island Southeast Asia and their inferred population movements Chronological map of the Austronesian expansion Modern theories of the peopling of the Philippines islands are interpreted against the backdrop of the migrations of the wider Austronesian peoples. They comprise two major schools of thought, the \\"Out of Sundaland\\" models and the \\"Out of Taiwan\\" model. Of the two, however, the most widely accepted hypothesis is the Out-of-Taiwan model, which largely corresponds to linguistic, genetic, archaeological, and cultural evidence.  Out of Sundaland  The various \\"Out of Sundaland\\" hypotheses, posited by a minority of modern authors and differing slightly in the details, is similar to F. Landa Jocano's \\"Core Population\\" hypothesis. However, instead of the Philippines, they assume the origin of the Austronesian peoples as being the now sunken Sundaland landmass (modern Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula). These models have been criticized as relying only on mtDNA genetic data without accounting for admixture events, thus having results that mistakenly combine the much older Paleolithic Negrito populations with the newer Neolithic Austronesian peoples. =Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network= A notable model among the \\"Out of Sundaland\\" hypothesis is Wilhelm Solheim II's \\"Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network\\". It posited an alternative model based on maritime movement of people over different directions and routes. It suggests that people with distant origins from 50,000 years ago in the area of present-day coastal eastern Vietnam and Southern China had moved to the area of the Bismarck Islands south and east of Mindanao and developed into the Austronesian cultures. They supposedly later spread among seafarers from the area to the rest of Island Southeast Asia and areas along the South China Sea. In support of this idea Solheim notes there is little or no indication that Pre- or Proto Malayo-Polynesian was present in Taiwan. According to Solheim, \\"The one thing I feel confident in saying is that all native Southeast Asians are closely related culturally, genetically and to a lesser degree linguistically.\\" Out of Taiwan The most widely-accepted hypothesis today is the \\"Out of Taiwan\\" model, first proposed by Peter Bellwood. Although originally largely based on linguistic evidence, it has corresponded to archaeological, cultural, and genetic findings later on; including whole genome sequencing data, rather than the mtDNA sequencing relied upon by \\"Out of Sundaland\\" proponents. In this hypothesis, the first Austronesians reached the Philippines at around 2200 BC from Taiwan, settling the Batanes Islands and northern Luzon. From there, they rapidly spread downwards to the rest of the islands of the Philippines and Southeast Asia, as well as voyaging further east to reach the Northern Mariana Islands by around 1500 BC. They assimilated the earlier Negrito groups which arrived during the Paleolithic, resulting in the modern Filipino ethnic groups which all display various ratios of genetic admixture between Austronesian and Negrito groups.

Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 starting World War II, Stalin waited until September 17 before launching his own invasion of Poland. Part of the Karelia and Salla regions of Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and the Hertza region). It was known at the Nuremberg trials the existence of the secret protocol of the German‚ÄìSoviet pact regarding the planned divisions of these territories. The invasion of Bukovina violated the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence agreed with the Axis.Brackman, Roman. The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life (Psychology Press, 2001) p. 341, On 22 June 1941, Hitler launched an invasion of the Soviet Union. Stalin was confident that the total Allied war machine would eventually stop Germany, and with Lend Lease from the West, the Soviets stopped the Wehrmacht some 30 kilometers (or 18.6 miles) from Moscow. Over the next four years, the Soviet Union repulsed Axis offensives, such as at the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Kursk, and pressed forward to victory in large Soviet offensives, such as the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive. The bulk of Soviet fighting took place on the Eastern Front‚Äîincluding a continued war with Finland‚Äîbut it also invaded Iran (August 1941) in cooperation with the British and late in the war attacked Japan (August 1945), with which the Soviets had border wars earlier up until in 1939. Stalin met with Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Tehran Conference and began to discuss a two- front war against Germany and the future of Europe after the war. Berlin finally fell in April 1945. Fending off the German invasion and pressing to victory in the East required a tremendous sacrifice by the Soviet Union, which suffered the highest casualties in the war, losing more than 20 million citizens . Pact with Adolf Hitler Stalin and Ribbentrop at the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939. In August 1939, Stalin accepted Hitler's proposal into a non-aggression pact with Germany, negotiated by the foreign ministers Vyacheslav Molotov for the Soviets and Joachim von Ribbentrop for the Germans. Officially a non-aggression treaty only, an appended secret protocol, also reached on 23 August, divided the whole of eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, 2008Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non- Aggression Pact, executed 23 August 1939 The USSR was promised the eastern part of Poland, then primarily populated by Ukrainians and Belarusians, in case of its dissolution, and Germany recognised Latvia, Estonia and Finland as parts of the Soviet sphere of influence, with Lithuania added in a second secret protocol in September 1939.Christie, Kenneth, Historical Injustice and Democratic Transition in Eastern Asia and Northern Europe: Ghosts at the Table of Democracy, RoutledgeCurzon, 2002, Another clause of the treaty was that Bessarabia, then part of Romania, was to be joined to the Moldovan SSR, and become the Moldovan SSR under control of Moscow. The pact was reached two days after the breakdown of Soviet military talks with British and French representatives in August 1939 over a potential Franco-Anglo-Soviet alliance.Lionel Kochan. The Struggle For Germany. 1914‚Äì1945. New York, 1963 Political discussions had been suspended on 2 August, when Molotov stated that they could not be resumed until progress was made in military talks late in August, after the talks had stalled over guarantees for the Baltic states,Michael Jabara Carley (1993).

Soviet cavalry on parade in Lviv (then Lw√≥w), after the city's surrender during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland After disagreement regarding Stalin's demand to move Red Army troops through Poland and Romania (which Poland and Romania opposed), on 21 August, the Soviets proposed adjournment of military talks using the pretext that the absence of the senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces, though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet- German negotiations. That same day, Stalin received assurance that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would grant the Soviets land in Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Romania, after which Stalin telegrammed Hitler that night that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August.Shirer, William L., The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, Simon and Schuster, 1990 , pages 528 Regarding the larger issue of collective security, some historians state that one reason that Stalin decided to abandon the doctrine was the shaping of his views of France and Britain by their entry into the Munich Agreement and the subsequent failure to prevent the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.Max Beloff The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia. vol. II, I936-41. Oxford University Press, 1949. p. 166, 211.For example, in his article From Munich to Moscow, Edward Hallett Carr explains the reasons behind signing a non-aggression pact between USSR and Germany as follows: Since 1934 the U.S.S.R. had firmly believed that Hitler would start a war somewhere in Europe: the bugbear of Soviet policy was that it might be a war between Hitler and the U.S.S.R. with the western powers neutral or tacitly favourable to Hitler. In order to conjure this bugbear, one of three alternatives had to be envisaged: (i) a war against Germany in which the western powers would be allied with the U.S.S.R. (this was the first choice and the principal aim of Soviet policy from 1934‚Äì38); (2) a war between Germany and the western powers in which the U.S.S.R. would be neutral (this was clearly hinted at in the Pravda article of 21 September 1938, and Molotov's speech of 6 November 1938, and became an alternative policy to (i) after March 1939, though the choice was not finally made till August 1939); and (3) a war between Germany and the western powers with Germany allied to the U.S.S.R. (this never became a specific aim of Soviet policy, though the discovery that a price could be obtained from Hitler for Soviet neutrality made the U.S.S.R. a de facto, though non-belligerent, partner of Germany from August 1939 till, at any rate, the summer of 1940)., see E. H. Carr., From Munich to Moscow. I., Soviet Studies, Vol. 1, No. 1, (June, 1949), pp. 3‚Äì17. Taylor & Francis, Ltd.This view is disputed by Werner Maser and Dmitri Volkogonov Stalin may also have viewed the pact as gaining time in an eventual war with Hitler in order to reinforce the Soviet military and shifting Soviet borders westwards, which would be militarily beneficial in such a war.Yuly Kvitsinsky. Russia-Germany: memoirs of the future, Moscow, 2008 p.95 Stalin and Ribbentrop spent most of the night of the pact's signing trading friendly stories about world affairs and cracking jokes (a rarity for Ribbentrop) about Britain's weakness, and the pair even joked about how the Anti-Comintern Pact principally scared \\"British shopkeepers.\\"Shirer, William L., The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, Simon and Schuster, 1990 , pages 541 They further traded toasts, with Stalin proposing a toast to Hitler's health and Ribbentrop proposing a toast to Stalin. The division of Eastern Europe and other invasions Brest in front of a photo of Stalin On 1 September 1939, the German invasion of its agreed upon portion of Poland started the Second World War. On 17 September the Red Army invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland. Eleven days later, the secret protocol of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was modified, allotting Germany a larger part of Poland, while ceding most of Lithuania to the Soviet Union. The Soviet portions lay east of the so-called Curzon Line, an ethnographic frontier between Russia and Poland drawn up by a commission of the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

On March 5, 1940, pursuant to a note to Stalin from Lavrenty Beria, the members of the Soviet Politburo (including Stalin) signed and 22,000 military and intellectuals were executed they were labelled \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\", kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus. This became known as the Katyn massacre.Sanford, Google Books, p. 20-24. Major-General Vasili M. Blokhin, chief executioner for the NKVD, personally shot 6,000 of the captured Polish officers in 28 consecutive nights, which remains one of the most organized and protracted mass murders by a single individual on record. During his 29-year career Blokhin shot an estimated 50,000 people,Katyn executioners named Gazeta Wyborcza. December 15, 2008 making him ostensibly the most prolific official executioner in recorded world history. In August 1939, Stalin declared that he was going to \\"solve the Baltic problem, and thereafter, forced Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to sign treaties for \\"mutual assistance.\\" After unsuccessfully attempting to install a communist puppet government in Finland, in November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland.Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, Stalin's Cold War, New York : Manchester University Press, 1995, The Finnish defensive effort defied Soviet expectations, and after stiff losses, Stalin settled for an interim peace granting the Soviet Union less than total domination by annexing only the eastern region of Karelia (10% of Finnish territory). Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000, while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million.Mosier, John, The Blitzkrieg Myth: How Hitler and the Allies Misread the Strategic Realities of World War II, HarperCollins, 2004, , page 88 After this campaign, Stalin took actions to modify training and improve propaganda efforts in the Soviet military. In mid-June 1940, when international attention was focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in the Baltic countries.Senn, Alfred Erich, Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above, Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 Stalin claimed that the mutual assistance treaties had been violated, and gave six-hour ultimatums for new governments to be formed in each country, including lists of persons for cabinet posts provided by the Kremlin. Thereafter, state administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres, followed by mass repression in which 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians were deported or killed. Elections for parliament and other offices were held with single candidates listed, the official results of which showed pro-Soviet candidates approval by 92.8 percent of the voters of Estonia, 97.6 percent of the voters in Latvia and 99.2 percent of the voters in Lithuania. The resulting peoples' assemblies immediately requested admission into the USSR, which was granted. In late June 1940, Stalin directed the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, proclaiming this formerly Romanian territory part of the Moldavian SSR. But in annexing northern Bukovina, Stalin had gone beyond the agreed limits of the secret protocol. Stalin and Molotov on the signing of the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, 1941 After the Tripartite Pact was signed by Axis Powers Germany, Japan and Italy, in October 1940, Stalin personally wrote to Ribbentrop about entering an agreement regarding a \\"permanent basis\\" for their \\"mutual interests.\\" Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact. At Stalin's direction, Molotov insisted on Soviet interest in Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Greece, though Stalin had earlier unsuccessfully personally lobbied Turkish leaders to not sign a mutual assistance pact with Britain and France. Ribbentrop asked Molotov to sign another secret protocol with the statement: \\"The focal point of the territorial aspirations of the Soviet Union would presumably be centered south of the territory of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean.\\" Molotov took the position that he could not take a \\"definite stand\\" on this without Stalin's agreement. Stalin did not agree with the suggested protocol, and negotiations broke down. In response to a later German proposal, Stalin stated that the Soviets would join the Axis if Germany foreclosed acting in the Soviet's sphere of influence. Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret internal directive related to his plan to invade the Soviet Union. Photo from 1943 exhumation of mass grave of Polish officers killed by NKVD in the Katyn Forest in 1940 In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on 13 April 1941, Stalin oversaw the signing of a neutrality pact with Japan. Since the Treaty of Portsmouth, Russia had been competing with Japan for spheres of influence in the Far East, where there was a power vacuum with the collapse of Imperial China. Although similar to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with the Third Reich, that Soviet Union signed Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, to maintain the national interest of Soviet's sphere of influence in the European continent as well as the Far East conquest, whilst among the few countries in the world diplomatically recognizing Manchukuo, and allowed the rise of German invasion in Europe and Japanese aggression in Asia, but the Japanese defeat of Battles of Khalkhin Gol was the forceful factor to the temporary settlement before Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 as the result of Yalta Conference. While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany, before military confrontation when Hitler controlled Western Europe and for Soviet Union to take control Eastern Europe. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union, though Stalin was not aware of Hitler's further military ambition. Termination of the pact During the early morning of 22 June 1941, Hitler terminated the pact by launching Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of Soviet-held territories and the Soviet Union that began the war on the Eastern Front. Before the invasion, Stalin thought that Germany would not attack the Soviet Union until Germany had defeated Britain. At the same time, Soviet generals warned Stalin that Germany had concentrated forces on its borders. Two highly placed Soviet spies in Germany, \\"Starshina\\" and \\"Korsikanets\\", had sent dozens of reports to Moscow containing evidence of preparation for a German attack. Further warnings came from Richard Sorge, a Soviet spy in Tokyo working undercover as a German journalist who had penetrated deep into the German Embassy in Tokyo by seducing the wife of General Eugen Ott, the German ambassador to Japan. German soldiers march by a burning home in Soviet Ukraine, October 1941. Seven days before the invasion, a Soviet spy in Berlin, part of the Rote Kapelle (Red Orchestra) spy network, warned Stalin that the movement of German divisions to the borders was to wage war on the Soviet Union. Five days before the attack, Stalin received a report from a spy in the German Air Ministry that \\"all preparations by Germany for an armed attack on the Soviet Union have been completed, and the blow can be expected at any time.\\" In the margin, Stalin wrote to the people's commissar for state security, \\"you can send your 'source' from the headquarters of German aviation to his mother. This is not a 'source' but a dezinformator.\\" Although Stalin increased Soviet western border forces to 2.7 million men and ordered them to expect a possible German invasion, he did not order a full-scale mobilisation of forces to prepare for an attack. Stalin felt that a mobilization might provoke Hitler to prematurely begin to wage war against the Soviet Union, which Stalin wanted to delay until 1942 in order to strengthen Soviet forces. In the initial hours after the German attack began, Stalin hesitated, wanting to ensure that the German attack was sanctioned by Hitler, rather than the unauthorized action of a rogue general.Simon Sebag Montefiore. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, Knopf, 2004 () Accounts by Nikita Khrushchev and Anastas Mikoyan claim that, after the invasion, Stalin retreated to his dacha in despair for several days and did not participate in leadership decisions. But, some documentary evidence of orders given by Stalin contradicts these accounts, leading historians such as Roberts to speculate that Khrushchev's account is inaccurate. Stalin soon quickly made himself a Marshal of the Soviet Union, then country's highest military rank and Supreme Commander in Chief of the Soviet Armed Forces aside from being Premier and General- Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union that made him the leader of the nation, as well as the People's Commissar for Defence, which is equivalent to the U.S. Secretary of War at that time and the U.K. Minister of Defence and formed the State Defense Committee to coordinate military operations with himself also as Chairman. He chaired the Stavka, the highest defense organisation of the country. Meanwhile, Marshal Georgy Zhukov was named to be the Deputy Supreme Commander in Chief of the Soviet Armed Forces. Soviet PoWs starving in a Nazi camp KZ Mauthausen. In the first three weeks of the invasion, as the Soviet Union tried to defend itself against large German advances, it suffered 750,000 casualties, and lost 10,000 tanks and 4,000 aircraft. In July 1941, Stalin completely reorganized the Soviet military, placing himself directly in charge of several military organizations. This gave him complete control of his country's entire war effort; more control than any other leader in World War II. A pattern soon emerged where Stalin embraced the Red Army's strategy of conducting multiple offensives, while the Germans overran each of the resulting small, newly gained grounds, dealing the Soviets severe casualties. The most notable example of this was the Battle of Kiev, where over 600,000 Soviet troops were quickly killed, captured or missing. By the end of 1941, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties and the Germans had captured 3.0 million Soviet prisoners, 2.0 million of whom died in German captivity by February 1942. German forces had advanced c. 1,700 kilometres, and maintained a linearly-measured front of 3,000 kilometres.Glantz, David, The Soviet-German War 1941‚Äì45: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay, October 11, 2001, page 7 The Red Army put up fierce resistance during the war's early stages. Even so, according to Glantz, they were plagued by an ineffective defence doctrine against well-trained and experienced German forces, despite possessing some modern Soviet equipment, such as the KV-1 and T-34 tanks. Soviets stop the Germans While the Germans made huge advances in 1941, killing millions of Soviet soldiers, at Stalin's direction the Red Army directed sizable resources to prevent the Germans from achieving one of their key strategic goals, the attempted capture of Leningrad. They held the city at the cost of more than a million Soviet soldiers in the region and more than a million civilians, many of whom died from starvation. While the Germans pressed forward, Stalin was confident of an eventual Allied victory over Germany. In September 1941, Stalin told British diplomats that he wanted two agreements: (1) a mutual assistance/aid pact and (2) a recognition that, after the war, the Soviet Union would gain the territories in countries that it had taken pursuant to its division of Eastern Europe with Hitler in the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. The British agreed to assistance but refused to agree to the territorial gains, which Stalin accepted months later as the military situation had deteriorated somewhat by mid-1942. On 6 November 1941, Stalin rallied his generals in a speech given underground in Moscow, telling them that the German blitzkrieg would fail because of weaknesses in the German rear in Nazi-occupied Europe and the underestimation of the strength of the Red Army, and that the German war effort would crumble against the Anglo-American-Soviet \\"war engine\\". Correctly calculating that Hitler would direct efforts to capture Moscow, Stalin concentrated his forces to defend the city, including numerous divisions transferred from Soviet eastern sectors after he determined that Japan would not attempt an attack in those areas. By December, Hitler's troops had advanced to within of the Kremlin in Moscow. On 5 December, the Soviets launched a counteroffensive, pushing German troops back c. from Moscow in what was the first major defeat of the Wehrmacht in the war. Iconic photo of a Soviet officer (thought to be Ukrainian Alexei Yeryomenko) leading his soldiers into battle against the invading German army, 12 July 1942, in Soviet Ukraine In early 1942, the Soviets began a series of offensives labelled \\"Stalin's First Strategic Offensives\\". The counteroffensive bogged down, in part due to mud from rain in the spring of 1942. Stalin's attempt to retake Kharkov in the Ukraine ended in the disastrous encirclement of Soviet forces, with over 200,000 Soviet casualties suffered. Stalin attacked the competence of the generals involved. General Georgy Zhukov and others subsequently revealed that some of those generals had wished to remain in a defensive posture in the region, but Stalin and others had pushed for the offensive. Some historians have doubted Zhukov's account. Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet ambassador to the United States At the same time, Hitler was worried about American popular support after the U.S. entry into the war following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and a potential Anglo-American invasion on the Western Front in 1942 (which did not occur until the summer of 1944). He changed his primary goal from an immediate victory in the East, to the more long-term goal of securing the southern Soviet Union to protect oil fields vital to the long- term German war effort. While Red Army generals correctly judged the evidence that Hitler would shift his efforts south, Stalin thought it a flanking move in the German attempt to take Moscow. The German southern campaign began with a push to capture the Crimea, which ended in disaster for the Red Army. Stalin publicly criticised his generals' leadership. In their southern campaigns, the Germans took 625,000 Red Army prisoners in July and August 1942 alone. At the same time, in a meeting in Moscow, Churchill privately told Stalin that the British and Americans were not yet prepared to make an amphibious landing against a fortified Nazi-held French coast in 1942, and would direct their efforts to invading German-held North Africa. He pledged a campaign of massive strategic bombing, to include German civilian targets. Estimating that the Russians were \\"finished,\\" the Germans began another southern operation in the autumn of 1942, the Battle of Stalingrad. Hitler insisted upon splitting German southern forces in a simultaneous siege of Stalingrad and an offensive against Baku on the Caspian Sea. Stalin directed his generals to spare no effort to defend Stalingrad.

Within a year after Barbarossa, Stalin reopened the churches in the Soviet Union. He may have wanted to motivate the majority of the population who had Christian beliefs. By changing the official policy of the party and the state towards religion, he could engage the Church and its clergy in mobilising the war effort. On 4 September 1943, Stalin invited the metropolitans Sergius, Alexy and Nikolay to the Kremlin. He proposed to reestablish the Moscow Patriarchate, which had been suspended since 1925, and elect the Patriarch. On 8 September 1943, Metropolitan Sergius was elected Patriarch. One account said that Stalin's reversal followed a sign that he supposedly received from heaven.(Radzinsky 1996, p.472-3) The Frontoviki Over 75% of Red Army divisions were listed as \\"rifle divisions\\" (as infantry divisions were known in the Red Army).Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 5. In the Imperial Russian Army, the strelkovye (rifle) divisions were considered more prestigious than pekhotnye (infantry) divisions, and in the Red Army, all infantry divisions were labeled strelkovye divisions. The Soviet rifleman was known as a peshkom (\\"on foot\\") or more frequently as a frontovik ( - front fighter; plural - frontoviki). The term frontovik was not equivalent to the German term Landser, the American G.I Joe nor the British Tommy Atkins, all of which referred to soldiers in general, as the term frontovik applied only to those infantrymen who fought at the front. All able-bodied males in the Soviet Union became eligible for conscription at the age of 19 - those attending a university or a technical school were able to escape conscription, and even then could defer military service for a period ranging from 3 months to a year. Deferments could be only offered three times. The Soviet Union comprised 20 military districts, which corresponded with the borders of the oblasts, and were further divided into raions (counties). The raions had assigned quotas specifying the number of men they had to produce for the Red Army every year.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 7. The vast majority of the frontoviks had been born in the 1920s and had grown up knowing nothing other than the Soviet system.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 8. Every year, men received draft notices in the mail informing to report at a collection point, usually a local school, and customarily reported to duty with a bag or suitcase carrying some spare clothes, underwear, and tobacco. The conscripts then boarded a train to a military reception center where they were issued uniforms, underwent a physical test, had their heads shaven and were given a steam bath to rid them of lice. A typical soldier was given ammo pouches, shelter-cape, ration bag, cooking pot, water bottle and an identity tube containing papers listing pertinent personal information.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 9. During training, conscripts woke up between 5 and 6 am; training lasted for 10 to 12 hours - six days of the week.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 10. Much of the training was done by rote and consisted of instruction.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 11. Before 1941 training had lasted for six months, but after the war, training was shorted to a few weeks. After finishing training, all men had to take the Oath of the Red Army which read: > I______, a citizen of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, entering > into the ranks of the Red Army of the Workers and Peasants', take this oath > and solemnly promise to be a honest, brave, disciplined, vigilant fighter, > staunchly to protect military and state secrets, and unquestioningly to obey > all military regulations and orders of commanders and superiors. > > I promise conscientiously to study military affairs, in every way to protect > state secrets and state property, and to my last breath to be faithful to > the people, the Soviet Motherland, and the Workers-Peasants' Government. > > I am always prepared on order of the Workers and Peasants Government to rise > to the defense of my Motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; > and as a fighting man of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants', I promise to > defend it bravely, skillfully, with dignity and honor, sparing neither my > blood nor my life itself for the achievement of total victory over our > enemies. > > If by evil intent I should violate this, my solemn oath, then let the severe > punishment of Soviet law and the total hatred and contempt of the working > classes befall me.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey > 2007 pages 11-12. Tactics were based on the 1936 training manual and on the revised edition of 1942.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 12. Small-unit movements and how to build defensive positions were laid out in a manner that was easy to understand and memorize.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 13. The manuals had the force of law and violations of the manuals counted as legal offenses. Soviet tactics always had the platoons attacking in the same way - with the platoons usually broken into four sections occupying about 100 yards on average.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 16. The only complex formation was the diamond formation - with one section advancing, two behind and one in the rear. Unlike the Wehrmacht, the Red Army did not engage in leap-frogging of sections with one section providing fire support to the sections that were advancing: instead all of the sections and platoons attacked en masse. The other only variation was for the sections to \\"seep\\" into a position by infiltration. British and Soviet servicemen over body of swastikaed dragon U.S. government poster showing a friendly Red Army soldier, 1942 When the order Na shturm, marshch! (Assault, march!) was given, the Soviet infantry would charge the enemy while shouting the traditional Russian battle cry Urra! (, pronounced oo-rah), the sound of which many German veterans found terrifying.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 pages 16-17. During the charge, the riflemen would fire with rifles and submachine guns while throwing grenades before closing in for blizhnii boi ( - close combat - close-quarter fighting with guns, bayonets, rifle butts, knives, digging tools and fists), a type of fighting at which the Red Army excelled.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 17. On the defensive, the frontoviki had a reputation for their skill at camouflaging their positions and for their discipline in withholding fire until Axis forces came within close range. Before 1941 Red Army doctrine had called for opening fire at maximum range, but experience quickly taught the advantages of ambushing the enemy with surprise fire at close ranges from multiple positions. The typical frontovik during the war was an ethnic Russian aged 19‚Äì24 with an average height of .Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 18. Most of the men were shaven bald to prevent lice and the few who did grow their hair kept it very short. The American historian Gordon Rottman describes the uniforms as \\"simple and functional\\". In combat, the men wore olive-brown helmets or the pilotka (side cap). Officers wore a shlem (helmet) or a ( - peaked cap), a round service-hat with a black visor and a red star. Rottman described Soviet weapons as \\"...known for their simplicity, ruggedness and general reliability\\".Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 23. The standard rifle, a Mosin- Nagant 7.62 mm M 1891/30, although heavy, was an effective weapon that crucially was not affected by the cold.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 24. Every rifle section had one or two 7.62 mm Degtyaryov DP light machine guns to provide fire support.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 25. By 1944, one of every four frontoviki was armed with the 7.62 mm PPSh-41 (Pistolet-pulemet Shapagina-Pistol Automatic Shpagin), a type of submachine gun known as a \\"rugged and reliable weapon\\", if somewhat underpowered. The frontovik usually carried all he had in a simple bag.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 31. Most of the frontoviki had a perevyazochny paket (wound dressing packet), a razor, a shovel and would be very lucky to have a towel and toothbrush.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 32. Toothpaste, shampoo and soap were extremely rare. Usually sticks with chewed ends were used for brushing teeth. Latrine pits were dug, as portable toilets were rare in the Red Army.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 41. Soldiers frequently slept outdoors, even during the winter. Food was usually abysmal and often in short supply, especially in 1941 and 1942. The frontoviki detested the rear-service troops who did not face the dangers of combat as krysy ( - rats; singular: ).Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 42. The frontovik lived on a diet of black rye bread; canned meats like fish and tushonka (stewed pork); shchi (cabbage soup) and kasha (porridge).‚Äù. Kasha and shchi were so common that a popular slogan in the Red Army was \\"shchi ee kasha, pisha nasha\\" (\\"schchi and kasha, that's our fare\\".). Chai ( - hot sugared tea) was an extremely popular beverage, along with beer and vodka.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 43. Makhorka, a type of cheap tobacco rolled into handmade cigarettes, was the standard for smoking. Rottmann describes medical care as \\"marginal\\". A shortage of doctors, medical equipment and drugs meant those wounded often died, usually in immense pain. Morphine was unknown in the Red Army. Most Red Army soldiers had not received preventive inoculations, and diseases became major problems - with malaria, pneumonia, diphtheria, tuberculosis, typhus, dysentery, and meningitis in particular regularly sickening Red-Army men. In the winter frostbite often sent soldiers to the medical system, while in the spring and fall rains made trench foot a common ailment. The frontoviki had a pay day once every month, but often did not receive their wages.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 44. All soldiers were exempt from taxes. In 1943 a private was paid 600 roubles per month, a corporal 1,000 roubles, a junior sergeant 2,000 roubles and a sergeant 3,000 roubles. Special pay accrued to those serving in guards units, tanks, and anti-tank units, to paratroopers and to those decorated for bravery in combat. Those units that greatly distinguished themselves in combat had the prefix \\"Guards\\" () prefixed to their unit title, a title of great respect and honor that brought better pay and rations.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 47. In the Imperial Russian Army, the elite had always been the Imperial Guards regiments, and the title \\"Guards\\" when applied to a military unit in Russia still has elitist connotations. Discipline was harsh and men could be executed, for desertion and ordering a retreat without orders. To maintain morale, the men were often entertained with films shown on outdoor screens, together with musical troupes performing music, singing and dancing.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 45. The balalaikaregarded as a Russian \\"national instrument\\"often featured as part of the entertainment. The Soviet regime held the position that essentially sex did not exist, and no official publications made any references to matters sexual. After the Germans hanged the 18-year old partisan heroine Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya (29 November 1941), the photo of her corpse caused a sensation when published in early 1942 as she was topless, which ensured that the photo attracted much prurient interest. Unlike the German and French armies, the Red Army had no system of field brothels and the frontoviki were not issued condoms as men in the British and American armies were. Venereal diseases were a major problem and those soldiers afflicted were harshly punished if discovered. The widespread rapes committed by the Red Army when entering Germany had little to do with sexual desire, but were instead acts of power, in the words of Rottman \\"the basest form of revenge and humiliation the soldiers could inflict on the Germans\\". It was a common practice for officers to take \\"campaign wives\\" or PPZh (). Women serving in the Red Army Sometimes were told that they were now the mistresses of the officers, regardless of what they felt about the matter.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 46. The \\"campaign wives\\" were often nurses, signalers and clerks who wore a black beret. Despite being forced to become the concubines of the officers, they were widely hated by the frontoviki, who saw the \\"campaign wives\\" as trading sex for more favorable positions.Beevor, Antony & Vinogradova, Luba A Writer at War Vasily Grossman With the Red Army 1941-1945, New York: Alfred Knopf, 2005 page 120. The writer Vasily Grossman recorded typical remarks about the \\"campaign wives\\" in 1942: \\"Where's the general?\\" [someone asks]. \\"Sleeping with his whore.\\" And these girls had once wanted to be 'Tanya',The name \\"Tanya\\" came into use as a pseudonym of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya. or Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya.Beevor, Antony & Vinogradova, Luba A Writer at War Vasily Grossman With the Red Army 1941-1945, New York: Alfred Knopf, 2005 page 121. The frontoviki had to live, fight and die in small circular foxholes dug into the earth with enough room for one or two men. Slit trenches connected what the Germans called \\"Russian holes\\". The soldiers were usually not issued blankets or sleeping bags, even in the winter.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 48. Instead, the frontoviki slept in their coats and shelter-capes, usually on pine, evergreen needles, fir boughs, piled leaves or straw. In the winter, the temperature could drop as low as -60 ¬∞F (-50 ¬∞C), making General Moroz (General Frost) as much an enemy as the Germans. Spring started in April and with it came rains and snowmelt, turning the battlefields into a muddy quagmire. Summers were dusty and hot while with the fall came the rasputitsa (time without roads) as heavy autumn rains once again turned the battlefields into muddy quagmires that made the spring rains look tame by comparison.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 49. The Soviet Union encompassed over 150 different languages and dialects but Russians comprised the majority of the Red Army and Russian was the language of command. The Red Army had very few ethnic units, as the policy was one of sliianie () in which men from the non-Russian groups were assigned to units with Russian majorities. The few exceptions to this rule included the Cossack units and the troops from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who however were few in number.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 pages 49-50. The experience of combat tended to bind the men together regardless of their language or ethnicity, with one Soviet veteran recalling: \\"We were all bleeding the same blood.\\".Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 50. Despite a history of anti-Semitism in Russia, Jewish veterans serving in the frontovik units described anti-Semitism as rare, instead recalling a sense of belonging. During the first six months of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht and the SS had a policy of shooting all of the commissars. Jews serving in the Red Army who were taken prisoner by German forces also received short shrift.Shirer, William The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, New York: Viking page 953Compare: During the war, the Soviet authorities toned down pro-atheist propaganda, and Eastern Orthodox priests blessed units going into battle, though chaplains were not allowed. Muslims from Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Volga and the Crimea were allowed to practice their religion discreetly, though - as with Eastern Orthodox - no chaplains were allowed. Most soldiers carried lucky talismans.Merridale, Catherine Ivan's War The Red Army 1939-1945, London: Faber and Faber, 2005 page 168 Despite official Soviet atheism, many soldiers wore crosses around their necks and crossed themselves in the traditional Eastern Orthodox manner before going into battle, through the British historian Catherine Merridale interprets these actions as more \\"totemic\\" gestures meant to ensure good luck rather than expressions of \\"real\\" faith.Merridale, Catherine: Ivan's War The Red Army 1939-1945, London: Faber and Faber, 2005 pages 168-169. One of the most popular talismans was the poem Wait for Me by Konstantin Simonov, which he wrote in October 1941 for his fianc√©e Valentina Serova. The popularity of Wait for Me was such that almost all ethnic Russians in the Red Army knew the poem by heart, and carried a copy of the poem - together with photographs of their girlfriends or wives back home - to reflect their desire to return to their loved ones. \\"Political work\\" done by politruks and kommissars took much of the soldiers' spare time, as at least one hour every day was given to political indoctrination into Communism for soldiers not engaged in combat.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 pages 50-51. The term Nazi was never used to describe the enemy, as the term was an acronym for National-Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party) and the politruks and kommissars found explaining why the enemy called themselves \\"National Socialists\\" to be too confusing for the frontoviki. The preferred terms for the enemy were \\"fascists\\", Gitleritsy (Hitlerites - the Russian language has no \\"H\\"-sound), Germanskii and nemetskiye ( - a derogatory Russian term for Germans).Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 51. The commissars had the duty of monitoring Red Army officers for any sign of disloyalty, and maintained a network of informers known as seksots ( - secret collaborators) within the ranks. In October 1942 the system of dual command, which dated back to the Russian Civil War, and in which the officers shared authority with the commissars, was abolished - thenceforward only officers had the power of command.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 52. Many commissars after the Stalin's Decree 307 of 9 October 1942 were shocked to find how much the officers and men hated them.Beevor, Antony & Vinogradova, Luba A Writer at War Vasily Grossman With the Red Army 1941-1945, New York: Alfred Knopf, 2005 page 219. The commissars now become the politruks or deputy commanders for political affairs. The politruks no longer had the power of command, but still evaluated both officers and men for their political loyalty, carried out political indoctrination and had the power to order summary executions of anyone suspected of cowardice or treason. Such executions were known as devyat gram (nine grams - a reference to the weight of a bullet), pustit v rakhod (to expend someone) or vyshka (a shortened form of vysshaya mera nakazanija - extreme penalty). Despite these fearsome powers, many of the frontoviki were often openly contemptuous of the politruks if subjected to excessively long boring lectures on the finer points of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, and officers tended to win conflicts with the poltitruks as military merit started to count more in the Great Patriotic War than did political zeal. Relations between the officers and men were usually good, with junior officers in particular being seen as soratniki (comrades in arms) as they lived under the same conditions and faced the same dangers as the frontoviki.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 53 Officers usually had only a high-school educationvery few had gone to universityand coming from the same social milieu as their men ensured that they could relate to them.Rottman, Gordon Soviet Rifleman 1941-45, London: Osprey 2007 page 53. The frontoviki usually addressed their company commanders as Batya (father). Soviet push to Germany The center of Stalingrad after liberation in 1943 The Soviets repulsed the important German strategic southern campaign and, although 2.5 million Soviet casualties were suffered in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front. World War II military deaths in Europe by theater and by year. The German armed forces suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front. Stalin personally told a Polish general requesting information about missing Polish officers that all of the Poles were freed, and that not all could be accounted because the Soviets \\"lost track\\" of them in Manchuria.

In 1943, Stalin ceded to his generals' call for the Soviet Union to take a defensive stance because of disappointing losses after Stalingrad, a lack of reserves for offensive measures and a prediction that the Germans would likely next attack a bulge in the Soviet front at Kursk such that defensive preparations there would more efficiently use resources. The Germans did attempt an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets after Hitler cancelled the offensive, in part, because of the Allied invasion of Sicily,McCarthy, Peter, Panzerkrieg: The Rise and Fall of Hitler's Tank Divisions, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2003, , page 196 though the Soviets suffered over 800,000 casualties.Russian Central Military Archive TsAMO, f.

Furthermore, another 1,104 Soviet aircraft were lost between 12 July and 18 August. Bergstr√∂m, Christer (2007). Kursk ‚Äî The Air Battle: July 1943. Chevron/Ian Allan. , page 221. Kursk also marked the beginning of a period where Stalin became more willing to listen to the advice of his generals. By the end of 1943, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans from 1941‚Äì42. Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the East of the front, safe from German invasion and air attack. The strategy paid off, as such industrial increases were able to occur even while the Germans in late 1942 occupied more than half of European Russia, including 40 percent (80 million) of its population, and approximately of Soviet territory. The Soviets had also prepared for war for more than a decade, including preparing 14 million civilians with some military training. Accordingly, while almost all of the original 5 million men of the Soviet army had been wiped out by the end of 1941, the Soviet military had swelled to 8 million members by the end of that year. Despite substantial losses in 1942 far in excess of German losses, Red Army size grew even further, to 11 million. While there is substantial debate whether Stalin helped or hindered these industrial and manpower efforts, Stalin left most economic wartime management decisions in the hands of his economic experts. While some scholars claim that evidence suggests that Stalin considered, and even attempted, negotiating peace with Germany in 1941 and 1942, others find this evidence unconvincing and even fabricated. thumbSoviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944: In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran. Roosevelt told Stalin that he hoped that Britain and America opening a second front against Germany could initially draw 30‚Äì40 German division from the Eastern Front. Stalin and Roosevelt, in effect, ganged up on Churchill by emphasizing the importance of a cross-channel invasion of German-held northern France, while Churchill had always felt that Germany was more vulnerable in the \\"soft underbelly\\" of Italy (which the Allies had already invaded) and the Balkans. The parties later agreed that Britain and America would launch a cross-channel invasion of France in May 1944, along with a separate invasion of Southern France. Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with Germany, which Churchill tabled. In 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany, including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in Belarus against the German Army Group Centre. Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill closely coordinated, such that Bagration occurred at roughly the same time as American and British forces initiation of the invasion of German held Western Europe on France's northern coast. The operation resulted in the Soviets retaking Belarus and western Ukraine, along with the successful effective destruction of the Army Group Center and 300,000 German casualties, though at the cost of more than 750,000 Soviet casualties. Romanians greet the Soviet army entering the city of Bucharest on 31 August 1944. Successes at Operation Bagration and in the year that followed were, in large part, due to an operational improve of battle-hardened Red Army, which has learned painful lessons from previous years battling the powerful Wehrmacht: better planning of offensives, efficient use of artillery, better handling of time and space during attacks in contradiction to Stalin's order \\"not a step back\\". To a lesser degree, the success of Bagration was due to a weakened Wehrmacht that lacked the fuel and armament they needed to operate effectively,Williams, Andrew, D-Day to Berlin. Hodder, 2005, , page 213 growing Soviet advantages in manpower and materials, and the attacks of Allies on the Western Front. In his 1944 May Day speech, Stalin praised the Western allies for diverting German resources in the Italian Campaign, Tass published detailed lists of the large numbers of supplies coming from Western allies, and Stalin made a speech in November 1944 stating that Allied efforts in the West had already quickly drawn 75 German divisions to defend that region, without which, the Red Army could not yet have driven the Wehrmacht from Soviet territories. The weakened Wehrmacht also helped Soviet offensives because no effective German counter-offensive could be launched, U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin in Yalta, Soviet Union in February 1945 Beginning in the summer of 1944, a reinforced German Army Centre Group did prevent the Soviets from advancing in around Warsaw for nearly half a year. Some historians claim that the Soviets' failure to advance was a purposeful Soviet stall to allow the Wehrmacht to slaughter members of a Warsaw Uprising by the Polish home army in August 1944 that occurred as the Red Army approached, though others dispute the claim and cite sizable unsuccessful Red Army efforts to attempt to defeat the Wehrmacht in that region. Earlier in 1944, Stalin had insisted that the Soviets would annex the portions of Poland it divided with Germany in the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, while the Polish government in exile, which the British insisted must be involved in postwar Poland, demanded that the Polish border be restored to prewar locations. The rift further highlighted Stalin's blatant hostility toward the anti-communist Polish government in exile and their Polish home army, which Stalin felt threatened his plans to create a post-war Poland friendly to the Soviet Union. Further exacerbating the rift was Stalin's refusal to resupply the Polish home army, and his refusal to allow American supply planes to use the necessary Soviet air bases to ferry supplies to the Polish home army, which Stalin referred to in a letter to Roosevelt and Churchill as \\"power-seeking criminals\\". Worried about the possible repercussions of those actions, Stalin later began a Soviet supply airdrop to Polish rebels, though most of the supplies ended up in the hands of the Germans. The uprising ended in disaster with 20,000 Polish rebels and up to 200,000 civilians killed by German forces, with Soviet forces entering the city in January 1945. Soviet soldiers of the 1st Baltic Front during an attack in the Latvian city of Jelgava, 16 August 1944 Other important advances occurred in late 1944, such as the invasion of Romania in August and Bulgaria. The Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria in September 1944 and invaded the country, installing a communist government. Following the invasion of these Balkan countries, Stalin and Churchill met in the autumn of 1944, where they agreed upon various percentages for \\"spheres of influence\\" in several Balkan states, though the diplomats for neither leader knew what the term actually meant. The Red Army also expelled German forces from Lithuania and Estonia in late 1944 at the cost of 260,000 Soviet casualties. In late 1944, Soviet forces battled fiercely to capture Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, but could not take it, which became a topic so sensitive to Stalin that he refused to allow his commanders to speak of it.Erickson, John, The Road to Berlin, Yale University Press, 1999 , page 396-7. The Germans held out in the subsequent Battle of Budapest until February 1945, when the remaining Hungarians signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. Victory at Budapest permitted the Red Army to launch the Vienna Offensive in April 1945. To the northeast, the taking of Belarus and western Ukraine permitted the Soviets to launch the massive Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, where German intelligence had incorrectly guessed the Soviets would have a 3-to-1 numerical superiority advantage that was actually 5-to-1 (over 2 million Red Army personnel attacking 450,000 German defenders), the successful culmination of which resulted in the Red Army advancing from the Vistula River in Poland to the German Oder River in Eastern Germany.Duffy, C., Red Storm on the Reich: The Soviet March on Germany 1945, Routledge, 1991, Stalin's shortcomings as a strategist are frequently noted regarding the massive Soviet loss of life and early Soviet defeats. An example of it is the summer offensive of 1942, which led to even more losses by the Red Army and the recapture of initiative by the Germans. Stalin eventually recognized his lack of know-how and relied on his professional generals to conduct the war. Additionally, Stalin was well aware that other European armies had utterly disintegrated when faced with Nazi military efficacy and responded effectively by subjecting his army to galvanizing terror and nationalist appeals to patriotism. He also appealed to the Russian Orthodox church. Final victory American and Soviet troops meet east of the Elbe River, April 1945 By April 1945 Nazi Germany faced its last days, with 1.9 million German soldiers in the East fighting 6.4 million Red Army soldiers while 1 million German soldiers in the West battled 4 million Western Allied soldiers.Glantz, David, The Soviet-German War 1941‚Äì45: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay, October 11, 2001 While initial talk postulated a race to Berlin by the Allies, after Stalin successfully lobbied for Eastern Germany to fall within the Soviet \\"sphere of influence\\" at Yalta in February 1945, the Western Allies made no plans to seize the city by a ground operation.Beevor, Antony, Berlin: The Downfall 1945, Viking, Penguin Books, 2005, , page 194Williams, Andrew (2005). D-Day to Berlin. Hodder. ., page 310-1 Stalin remained suspicious that western Allied forces holding at the Elbe River might move on the German capital and, even in the last days, that the Americans might employ their two airborne divisions to capture the city.Erickson, John, The Road to Berlin, Yale University Press, 1999 , page 554 Stalin directed the Red Army to move rapidly in a broad front into Germany because he did not believe the Western Allies would hand over territory they occupied, while he made capturing Berlin the overriding objective.Beevor, Antony, Berlin: The Downfall 1945, Viking, Penguin Books, 2005, , page 219 After successfully capturing Eastern Prussia, three Red Army fronts converged on the heart of eastern Germany, and the Battle of the Oder-Neisse put the Soviets at the virtual gates of Berlin.Ziemke, Earl F (1969), Battle for Berlin End of the Third Reich Ballantine's Illustrated History of World War II (Battle Book #6), Ballantine Books, page 71. By April 24 elements of two Soviet fronts had encircled Berlin.Ziemke, Earl F, Battle For Berlin: End Of The Third Reich, NY:Ballantine Books, London:Macdonald & Co, 1969, pages 92‚Äì94 On April 20 Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had begun a massive shelling of Berlin that would not end until the city's surrender.Beevor, Antony, Revealed\\" Hitler's Secret Bunkers (2008) On 30 April 1945 Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide, after which Soviet forces found their remains, which had been burned at Hitler's directive.Bullock, Alan, Hitler: A Study in Tyranny, Penguin Books, , 1962, pages 799‚Äì800 Remaining German forces officially surrendered unconditionally on 7 May 1945. Some historians argue that Stalin delayed the last final push for Berlin by two months in order to capture other areas for political reasons, which they argue gave the Wehrmacht time to prepare and increased Soviet casualties (which exceeded 400,000); other historians contest this account.Glantz, David, The Soviet-German War 1941‚Äì45: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay, October 11, 2001, pages 91‚Äì93 Mass murder of Soviet civilians near Minsk. The Nazis murdered civilians in 5,295 different localities in occupied Soviet Belarus. Despite the Soviets' possession of Hitler's remains, Stalin did not believe that his old nemesis was actually dead, a belief that persisted for years after the war.Kershaw, Ian, Hitler, 1936‚Äì1945: Nemesis, W. W. Norton & Company, 2001, , pages 1038‚Äì39Dolezal, Robert, Truth about History: How New Evidence Is Transforming the Story of the Past, Readers Digest, 2004, , page 185-6 Stalin later directed aides to spend years researching and writing a secret book about Hitler's life for his own private reading.Eberle, Henrik, Matthias Uhl and Giles MacDonogh, The Hitler Book: The Secret Dossier Prepared for Stalin from the Interrogations of Hitler's Personal Aides, PublicAffairs, 2006, . A reprint of one of only two existing copies.

Vladimir Putin retained the only other known copy in a safe. Fending off the German invasion and pressing to victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War required a tremendous sacrifice by the Soviet Union (more than by any other country in human history). Soviet casualties totaled around 27 million.Glantz, David, The Soviet-German War 1941‚Äì45: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay, October 11, 2001, page 13 Although figures vary, the Soviet civilian death toll probably reached 18 million. Millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians disappeared into German detention camps and slave-labor factories, while millions more suffered permanent physical and mental damage. Soviet economic losses, including losses in resources and manufacturing capacity in western Russia and Ukraine, were also catastrophic. The war resulted in the destruction of approximately 70,000 Soviet cities, towns and villages \\\\- 6 million houses, 98,000 farms, 32,000 factories, 82,000 schools, 43,000 libraries, 6,000 hospitals and thousands of kilometers of roads and railway track. On 9 August 1945 the Soviet Union invaded Japanese-controlled Manchukuo and declared war on Japan. Battle- hardened Soviet troops and their experienced commanders rapidly conquered Japanese-held territories in Manchuria, southern Sakhalin (11-25 August 1945), the Kuril Islands (18 August to 1 September 1945) and parts of Korea (14 August 1945 to 24 August 1945). The Imperial Japanese government, vacillating following the bombing of Hiroshima (6 August 1945) and Nagasaki (9 August 1945), but faced with Soviet forces fast approaching the core Japanese homeland, announced its effective surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945 and formally capitulated on 2 September 1945. In June 1945 the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union conferred on Stalin for his role in the Soviet victory the newly-invented rank of Generalissimus of the Soviet Union, which became the country's highest military rank (superior to Marshal). Stalin's \\"cult of personality\\" emphasised his personal military leadership after the enumeration of \\"Stalin's ten victories\\" - extracted from Stalin's 6 November 1944 speech \\"27th anniversary of the Great October socialist revolution\\" () during the 1944 meeting of the Moscow Soviet of People's Deputies. Repressions On 16 August 1941, in attempts to revive a disorganized Soviet defense system, Stalin issued Order No. 270, demanding any commanders or commissars \\"tearing away their insignia and deserting or surrendering\\" to be considered malicious deserters. The order required superiors to shoot these deserters on the spot.Text of Order No. 270 Their family members were subjected to arrest. The second provision of the order directed all units fighting in encirclements to use every possibility to fight. The order also required division commanders to demote and, if necessary, even to shoot on the spot those commanders who failed to command the battle directly in the battlefield. Thereafter, Stalin also conducted a purge of several military commanders that were shot for \\"cowardice\\" without a trial. In June 1941, weeks after the German invasion began, Stalin directed that the retreating Red Army also sought to deny resources to the enemy through a scorched earth policy of destroying the infrastructure and food supplies of areas before the Germans could seize them, and that partisans were to be set up in evacuated areas. This, along with abuse by German troops, caused starvation and suffering among the civilian population that was left behind. Stalin feared that Hitler would use disgruntled Soviet citizens to fight his regime, particularly people imprisoned in the Gulags. He thus ordered the NKVD to handle the situation. They responded by murdering approximately 100,000 political prisoners throughout the western parts of the Soviet Union, with methods that included bayoneting people to death and tossing grenades into crowded cells.Robert Gellately. Lenin, Stalin and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe. Knopf, 2007 p. 391 Many others were simply deported east.Anne Applebaum. Gulag: A History, Doubleday, 2003 () See also: Allen Paul.

Stalin's resolution: \\"Shoot all named in the list. ‚Äì J. St.\\" In July 1942, Stalin issued Order No. 227, directing that any commander or commissar of a regiment, battalion or army, who allowed retreat without permission from his superiors was subject to military tribunal. The order called for soldiers found guilty of disciplinary infractions to be forced into \\"penal battalions\\", which were sent to the most dangerous sections of the front lines. From 1942 to 1945, 427,910 soldiers were assigned to penal battalions.G. I. Krivosheev. Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses. Greenhill 1997 The order also directed \\"blocking detachments\\" to shoot fleeing panicked troops at the rear. In the first three months following the order 1,000 penal troops were shot by \\"blocking detachments, and sent 24,933 troops to penal battalions. Despite having some effect initially, this measure proved to have a deteriorating effect on the troops' morale, so by October 1942 the idea of regular blocking detachments was quietly droppedCatherine Merridale. Ivan's War: Life and Death in the Red Army, 1939‚Äì1945. Page 158. Macmillan, 2006. By 29 October 1944 the blocking detachments were officially disbanded. Soviet POWs and forced labourers who survived German captivity were sent to special \\"transit\\" or \\"filtration\\" camps meant to determine which were potential traitors. Of the approximately 4 million to be repatriated, 2,660,013 were civilians and 1,539,475 were former POWs. Of the total, 2,427,906 were sent home, 801,152 were reconscripted into the armed forces, 608,095 were enrolled in the work battalions of the defence ministry, 226,127 were transferred to the authority of the NKVD for punishment, which meant a transfer to the Gulag system(‚Äú–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª‚Äù (‚ÄúMilitary-Historical Magazine‚Äù), 1997, No.5. page 32)–ó–µ–º—Å–∫–æ–µ –í.–ù. –ö –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ —Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω. 1944‚Äì1951 –≥–æ–¥—ã // –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –°–°–°–†. 1990.

Soviet war crimes Victims of NKVD prisoner massacres in June 1941 Soviet troops reportedly raped German women and girls, with total victim estimates ranging from tens of thousands to two million.Schissler, Hanna The Miracle Years: A Cultural History of West Germany, 1949‚Äì1968 During and after the occupation of Budapest, (Hungary), an estimated 50,000 women and girls were raped.Mark, James, \\"Remembering Rape: Divided Social Memory and the Red Army in Hungary 1944‚Äì1945\\", Past & Present ‚Äî Number 188, August 2005, page 133Naimark, Norman M., The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945‚Äì1949. Cambridge: Belknap, 1995, , pages 70‚Äì71 Regarding rapes that took place in Yugoslavia, Stalin responded to a Yugoslav partisan leader's complaints saying, \\"Can't he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometres through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?\\" In former Axis countries, such as Germany, Romania and Hungary, Red Army officers generally viewed cities, villages and farms as being open to pillaging and looting.Beevor, Antony, Berlin: The Downfall 1945, Penguin Books, 2002, .

For example, Red Army soldiers and NKVD members frequently looted transport trains in 1944 and 1945 in PolandUrban, Thomas, Der Verlust, Verlag C. H. Beck 2004, , page 145 and Soviet soldiers set fire to the city centre of Demmin while preventing the inhabitants from extinguishing the blaze,Beevor, Antony, Berlin: The Downfall 1945, Viking, Penguin Books, 2005, which, along with multiple rapes, played a part in causing over 900 citizens of the city to commit suicide.Buske, Norbert (Hg.): Das Kriegsende in Demmin 1945. Berichte Erinnerungen Dokumente (Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Landeskundliche Hefte), Schwerin 1995 In the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, when members of the SED reported to Stalin that looting and rapes by Soviet soldiers could result in negative consequences for the future of socialism in post-war East Germany, Stalin reacted angrily: \\"I shall not tolerate anybody dragging the honour of the Red Army through the mud.\\"Wolfgang Leonhard, Child of the Revolution, Pathfinder Press, 1979, Norman M. Naimark. The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945‚Äì1949. Harvard University Press, 1995. Accordingly, all evidence of looting, rapes and destruction by the Red Army was deleted from archives in the Soviet occupation zone.Wolfgang Leonhard, Child of the Revolution, Pathfinder Press, 1979, . According to recent figures, of an estimated 4 million POWs taken by the Russians, including Germans, Japanese, Hungarians, Romanians and others, some 580,000 never returned, presumably victims of privation or the Gulags, compared with 3.5 million Soviet POW who died in German camps out of the 5.6 million taken.Richard Overy, The Dictators Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia p.568‚Äì569 War crimes by Nazi Germany Men hanged as suspected partisans somewhere in the Soviet UnionFurther information War crimes of the Wehrmacht Clean Wehrmacht Generalplan Ost German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war German alt= Nazi propaganda had told Wehrmacht's soldiers the invasion of the Soviet Union was a war of extermination British historian Ian Kershaw concludes that the Wehrmacht's duty was to ensure that the people who met Hitler's requirements of being part of the Aryan Herrenvolk (\\"Aryan master race\\") had living space. He wrote that: The Nazi revolution was broader than just the Holocaust. Its second goal was to eliminate Slavs from central and eastern Europe and to create a Lebensraum for Aryans. ... As Bartov (The Eastern Front; Hitler's Army) shows, it barbarised the German armies on the eastern front. Most of their three million men, from generals to ordinary soldiers, helped exterminate captured Slav soldiers and civilians. This was sometimes cold and deliberate murder of individuals (as with Jews), sometimes generalised brutality and neglect. ... German soldiers' letters and memoirs reveal their terrible reasoning: Slavs were 'the Asiatic-Bolshevik' horde, an inferior but threatening race During the rapid German advances in the early months of the war, nearly reaching the cities of Moscow and Leningrad, the bulk of Soviet industry which could not be evacuated was either destroyed or lost due to German occupation. Agricultural production was interrupted, with grain harvests left standing in the fields that would later cause hunger reminiscent of the early 1930s. In one of the greatest feats of war logistics, factories were evacuated on an enormous scale, with 1523 factories dismantled and shipped eastwards along four principal routes to the Caucasus, Central Asian, Ural, and Siberian regions. In general, the tools, dies and production technology were moved, along with the blueprints and their management, engineering staffs and skilled labor. The whole of the Soviet Union became dedicated to the war effort. The population of the Soviet Union was probably better prepared than any other nation involved in the fighting of World War II to endure the material hardships of the war. This is primarily because the Soviets were so used to shortages and coping with economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime‚ÄîWorld War I brought similar restrictions on food. Still, conditions were severe. World War II was especially devastating to Soviet citizens because it was fought on their territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over one million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and the elderly. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar, and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Additional rations were often so expensive that they could not add substantially to a citizen's food supply unless that person was especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with local resources that they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold any surplus they had at a high price and a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two years after the end of the war wiped out their wealth.John Barber and Mark Harrison, The Soviet Home Front, 1941‚Äì1945: a social and economic history of the USSR in World War II (Longman, 1991), 77, 81, 85‚Äì6. Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. Soviet propaganda toned down extreme Communist rhetoric of the past as the people now rallied by a belief of protecting their Motherland against the evils of German invaders. Ethnic minorities thought to be collaborators were forced into exile. Religion, which was previously shunned, became a part of Communist Party propaganda campaign in the Soviet society in order to mobilize the religious elements. The social composition of Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was a burst of marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war and in the next few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honours and money benefits if they had a sufficient number of children‚Äîmothers could earn around 1,300 roubles for having their fourth child and earn up to 5,000 roubles for their 10th.Barber and Harrison, The Soviet Home Front, 1941‚Äì1945 91‚Äì93. German soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women ‚Äì and other women as well ‚Äì with the words \\"Whore for Hitler's troops\\" and rape them. Following their capture some German soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide. Susan Brownmiller argues that rape played a pivotal role in Nazi aim to conquer and destroy people they considered inferior, such as Jews, Russians, and Poles. An extensive list of rapes committed by German soldiers was compiled in the so called \\"Molotov Note\\" in 1942. Brownmiller points out that Nazis used rape as a weapon of terror. Examples of mass rapes in Soviet Union committed by German soldiers include Smolensk: German command opened a brothel for officers in which hundreds of women and girls were driven by force, often by arms and hair. Lviv: 32 women working in a garment factory were raped and murdered by German soldiers, in a public park. A priest trying to stop the atrocity was murdered. Lviv: Germans soldiers raped Jewish girls, who were murdered after getting pregnant. Survival in Leningrad Soviet soldiers on the front in Leningrad The city of Leningrad endured more suffering and hardships than any other city in the Soviet Union during the war, as it was under siege for 872 days, from September 8, 1941, to January 27, 1944. Hunger, malnutrition, disease, starvation, and even cannibalism became common during the siege of Leningrad; civilians lost weight, grew weaker, and became more vulnerable to diseases.Barber and Harrison, The Soviet Home Front, 1941‚Äì1945 pp 86‚Äì7. Citizens of Leningrad managed to survive through a number of methods with varying degrees of success. Since only 400,000 people were evacuated before the siege began, this left 2.5 million in Leningrad, including 400,000 children. More managed to escape the city; this was most successful when Lake Ladoga froze over and people could walk over the ice road‚Äîor ‚ÄúRoad of Life‚Äù‚Äîto safety. A victim of starvation in besieged Leningrad in 1941 Most survival strategies during the siege, though, involved staying within the city and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck. One way to do this was by securing factory employment because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the tools of survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers got larger rations than regular civilians and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced crucial goods. Factories also served as mutual-support centers and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of women who would sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horses in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.Bidlack, ‚ÄúSurvival Strategies in Leningrad pp 90‚Äì94. Survival opportunities open to the larger Soviet community included bartering and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with Soviet citizens that had extra warm clothes to trade. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens got to keep everything grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.Bidlack, ‚ÄúSurvival Strategies in Leningrad p 97. Some of the most desperate Soviet citizens turned to crime as a way to support themselves in trying times. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards, which could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day or two before a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes, such as murder and cannibalism, also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though by the end of the siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.Bidlack, ‚ÄúSurvival Strategies in Leningrad p 98 Aftermath and damages Soviet soldiers killed during the Toropets‚ÄìKholm Offensive, January 1942 Even though it won the conflict, the war had a profound and devastating long-term effect in the Soviet Union. The financial burden was catastrophic: by one estimate, the Soviet Union spent $192 billion. The US lend-lease around $11 billion in supplies to the Soviet Union during the war. Anastasia V. Zotova gives a slightly different estimate of 666.4 billion rubles in Soviet military expenditure during the war, equivalent to $125.7 billion. American experts estimate that the Soviet Union lost almost all the wealth it gained from the industrialization efforts during the 1930s. Its economy also shrank by 20% between 1941 and 1945 and did not recover its pre-war levels all until the 1960s. British historian Clive Ponting estimates that the war damages amounted to 25 years of the Soviet Gross National Product. 40% of the Soviet housing was damaged or destroyed. Out of 2.5 million housing dwellings in the German occupied territories, over a million were destroyed. This rendered some 25 million Soviet citizens homeless. The German occupation encompassed around 85 million Soviet citizens, or almost 45% of the entire Soviet population. At least 12 million Soviets fled towards the east, away from the invading German army. The Soviet sources claim that the Axis powers destroyed 1,710 towns and 70,000 villages, as well as 65,000 km of railroad tracks. The post-Soviet government of Russia puts the Soviet war 'losses' at 26.6 million, on the basis of the 1993 study by the Russian Academy of Sciences, including people dying as a result of battle and war related exposure. This includes 8,668,400 military deaths as calculated by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The figures published by the Russian Ministry of Defense have been accepted by the majority of historians and academics, some historians and academics give different estimates. Bruce Robellet Kuniholm, professor of public policy and history, estimates that the Soviet side suffered 11,000,000 military deaths and additional 7,000,000 civilian deaths, thus amounting to a total of 18 million fatalities. American military historian Earl F. Ziemke gives a figure of 12 million dead Soviet soldiers and further 7 million dead civilians‚Äìa total of 19 million dead. He also notices that from autumn 1941 until autumn 1943 the front was never less than 2,400 miles long. German professor Beate Fieseler estimates that 2.6 million people, or 7.46 percent of the Soviet Army, were left disabled after the war. Timothy C. Dowling estimates that in the 1,417 days of war, the Soviet Union lost the equivalent of the entire US population in 1940 living west of the Missouri River.

She translated the original English lyrics of Bohol Hymn into Binisaya (Awit sa Bohol). The Bohol Hymn is the official anthem of the Province of Bohol, Philippines, which was composed by Justino Romea from Loon town.http://www.bohol.ph/article35.html?sid=f986dd68e37736def50683bffcdff43a  Biography  Ganade started playing the piano while in Grade 3 as encouraged by her parents Nicomedes Ganade and Consorcia Bag-ao who are both musicians. She graduated her elementary and high school at Holy Spirit Tagbilaran City. She took Bachelor of Music from the College of the Holy Spirit in Manila and she had rendered performances, helped in musical shows and had written compositions. Ganade‚Äôs repertoire as an orchestral soloist ranges from the classical repertoire of Mozart and Beethoven to the Romantic literature of Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Schumann and Rachmaninoff to the modern works of Debussy, Ravel, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Bart√≥k. It was during the administration of then Governor Lino Chatto that the provincial government of Bohol undertook the initiative to formally identify the provincial symbols and seals, including the Bohol flag and hymn. Justino 'Ning\\" Romea, a writer of the Bohol Chronicle and composer of the RPC Song (now the UB Hymn) and the Bohol Provincial School of Nursing Hymn, was commissioned to pen the Bohol Provincial Hymn. It was first sung publicly by a female choir of the College of Holy Spirit of Tagbilaran on March 1, 1970 in time for the unfurling of the Bohol Flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1970 East Visayan Athletic Association held in Tagbilaran City. On September 24, 1970, the Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 215 adopting it as the official song of the province of Bohol. As the hymn's original version was in English, the Provincial Board, a few years after, endeavored to have it translated into the vernacular. It must be cited, however, that Justino Romea would have wanted to translate his original composition had the Board informed him. This intent of his can be read in \\"Bohol Without Tears\\" a three-volume book written and published by Simplicio M. Apalisok. Meanwhile, the competition was launched and the entry of Maxelende Ganade emerged as the best and was adjudged the winner. With some modifications by the Board of Judges in consultation with authorities in music Mrs. Enriquita Borja-Butalid and Mrs. Maria Fe Rocha- Lumayag, then Division Supervisor and music consultant, the Boholano version was adopted by the Provincial Board in Resolution No. 151 dated September 13, 1974. While the lyrics and music of the Bohol Hymn (English version) is credited to Romea, the Awit sa Bohol (Boholano version) is largely attributed to Ganade. Ganade also composed the Carmen hymn and other hymns in school and special affairs. Her arrangement of Pobreng Alindahaw is included in the Loboc Children's Choir and the almub: A Child's Heart Sings.

The eleventh named storm of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko formed out of a large mesoscale convective system on August 25\\\\. Slowly tracking northwestward, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane early the next day. Strengthening continued until early August 27, when Kiko reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The storm turned west at this time, and at around 0600 UTC, the storm made landfall near Punta Arena at the southern tip of Baja California Sur. The hurricane rapidly weakened into a tropical storm later that day and further into a tropical depression by August 28, shortly after entering the Pacific Ocean. The depression persisted for another day while tracking southward, before being absorbed by nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Though Kiko made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, its impact was relatively minor. Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains. Meteorological history Unlike most other eastern Pacific hurricanes between 1988 and 1990 that began as tropical waves off the western coast of Africa, Hurricane Kiko developed out of a large-scale mesoscale convective system on August 23 on the coast of Sonora. The system slowly tracked southward into the Gulf of California and became increasingly organized. Shower and thunderstorm activity was present around an area of low pressure the following day; however, insufficient reports from the region hindered the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) forecasting ability. By August 25, satellite intensity estimates, using the Dvorak technique, indicated that the low had developed into a tropical depression around 1200 UTC, while the storm was located about 115 miles (185 kilometers) south of Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression; instead it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kiko with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Located within an area with little or no steering current, and situated over warm waters and underneath an upper- level low, conditions were near perfect for rapid intensification, despite the proximity to land. A general northwestward drift was anticipated, and the NHC forecast the storm to reach hurricane intensity within 24 hours. Convective banding features began to develop late on August 25 as winds around the center reached 50 mph (85 km/h). With the development of an anticyclone over the storm, Kiko's outflow become more pronounced. Around 0600 UTC on August 26, an eye developed within the small circulation, suggesting the cyclone had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. However, satellite intensity estimates indicated winds of only 40 mph (65 km/h). Shortly after, Kiko was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Ships in the vicinity of the hurricane reported tropical storm-force winds extending roughly 50 mi (85 km) from the center. Winds within the eyewall subsequently increased to 115 mph (185 km/h), making Kiko a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Intensification continued for another six hours, ending around 0000 UTC on August 27, at which time the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg). Around the time of peak intensity, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T6.0, equating to a minimal Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph (215 km/h). A trough located to the north of the hurricane began to weaken, causing the storm to track in a more westward direction. Kiko weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Arena, on the southern tip of Baja California, with winds of 115 mph (185 mph). Kiko was thus the second major hurricane to ever make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Baja California since reliable recordkeeping began in 1949, with the other being 1967's Hurricane Olivia. Due to the small size and slow movement of the storm, it rapidly weakened, becoming a tropical storm by 1800 UTC. Convection associated with the storm significantly diminished; the center of circulation became nearly devoid of thunderstorm activity early on August 28. Shortly after emerging into the Pacific Ocean, Kiko was further downgraded into a tropical depression, and turned towards the southwest due to interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Tropical Depression Kiko dissipated around 1800 UTC on August 29; however, its remnants continued southward before being absorbed by Lorena. Preparations and impact Rainfall totals from Kiko Around 2100 UTC on August 25, the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane warning for the Islas Mar√≠as and areas between the southern border of Sonora and El Dorado. A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Los Burros and the southern tip of Baja California Sur along the Gulf of California. By 0900 UTC the following day, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a warning. Roughly three hours later, the previous hurricane watch issued for Sonora was discontinued as Kiko was no longer forecast to make landfall in the state. The hurricane warning on Baja California was also extended northward to Bah√≠a Concepci√≥n. Due to uncertainty in Kiko's track, a hurricane watch was re-issued for Sonora between El Dorado and Los Mochis. Around 0900 UTC on August 27, a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of San Carlos on the Pacific coast of Baja California. The hurricane watch for Sonora was then discontinued. By 1800 UTC, the hurricane warnings on the Gulf Coast of Baja California were replaced by a tropical storm warning which was declared for areas between the southern tip of the peninsula and Bah√≠a Concepci√≥n. At this time, the hurricane warning for the Pacific coast was revised to a tropical storm warning. Early on August 28, all watches and warnings were discontinued as Kiko weakened into a tropical depression and moved away from land. In Baja California Sur, more than 1,300 people evacuated to shelters in La Paz. Flights arriving and departing in the region were canceled or diverted to other airports. The Red Cross prepared shelters in schools, hospitals, and other public buildings throughout the city. On the Islas Mar√≠as, an unconfirmed report of sustained winds was relayed to the National Hurricane Center. Due to the hurricane's small size, only areas directly in the path of the storm received precipitation; however, a monsoonal outer band on the eastern side of the storm produced widespread rainfall in eastern Mexico. In Sonora, over of rain fell in mountainous areas, while numerous locations recorded at least . In Baja California, the heaviest rainfall was recorded in Los Cabos, and amounted to . Only a small portion of the peninsula received more than of rain. At least 1,000 people were evacuated from heavily damaged areas. Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed by Hurricane Kiko. High winds, gusting over , brought down numerous trees and power lines. Before Kiko's eye moved ashore, the airport near Cabo San Lucas reported sustained winds of with gusts up to . Meteorological recordings near the place of landfall were not available as the small system tracked over a sparsely populated region. From La Paz to Cabo San Lucas, power and water supplies were lost.Staff Writer (August 27, 1989). \\"Hurricane Kiko Weakens Over Southern Baja California\\". Associated Press The heavy rains flooded several highways, and the resultant flood waters overturned a bus. Passengers on the bus managed to escape injury and were quickly brought to shelter by the local fire department. The storm's effects washed out roughly of the San Antonio‚ÄìSan Bartolome highway.Staff Writer (August 27, 1989). \\"Hurricane Kiko dissipates into slow-moving tropical storm\\", United Press International The Rancho Leonero Resort in Buena Vista sustained severe roof damage and several docked boats were damaged. Several days after Kiko dissipated, remnant moisture from the storm contributed to a complex weather system that produced torrential rainfall throughout the U.S. state of Kansas, unofficially reaching in localized areas.

Construction She was ordered on 6 May 1757 from the yards of Pleasant Fenn, East Cowes and was laid down on 13 June 1757. She was launched just over a year later on 5 September 1758. The frigate was named after Cerberus, the multi-headed dog from Greek mythology that reputedly guarded the doors to Hades. The choice of name followed a trend initiated in 1748 by John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty, of using figures from classical antiquity as descriptors for naval vessels. A total of six Coventry-class vessels were named in this manner; a further ten were named after geographic features including regions, English or Irish rivers, or towns.Winfield 2007, pp. 227‚Äì231 In sailing qualities Cerberus was broadly comparable with French frigates of equivalent size, but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed with ample space for provisions and the ship's mess, and incorporating a large magazine for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics would enable Cerberus to remain at sea for long periods without resupply.Gardiner 1992, pp. 107108 She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced the weight of her hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail. The disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds.Gardiner 1992, pp. 111112 Her designated complement was 200, comprising two commissioned officers a captain and a lieutenant overseeing 40 warrant and petty officers, 91 naval ratings, 38 Marines and 29 servants and other ranks.Rodger 1986, pp.348351 Among these other ranks were four positions reserved for widow's men fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to the families of sailors who died at sea. Naval career Bushnell mines destroying a small British boat from Cerberus Lark and Cerberus wreck map Cerberus saw action in the American Revolutionary War. One of its first duties was to dispatch generals William Howe, Henry Clinton, and John Burgoyne to Boston after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The American press likened the three generals to the three-headed dog that was the ship's namesake. It provided naval reinforcement at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The ship was the target of an early torpedo attack by David Bushnell's newly developed powder keg torpedoes in 1777. The attack killed four sailorsBattle of the Kegs in a small boat, but did not severely damage the ship. Cerberus was eventually burnt to prevent being captured by the French on 5 August 1778 during the American War of Independence, in Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island.

It was first published in the July 1956 issue of Science Fiction Stories with the title \\"Art Work\\". It has often been anthologized, appearing in The Worlds of Science Fiction and The Golden Age of Science Fiction, among others. Plot In the year 00 2161, a new medical specialty has been developed, known as \\"Mind Sculpting.\\" Human personalities from history are re- created and placed into voluntarily donated physical bodies. Two mind sculptors, Drs. Kris and Seirds, re-create the mind of Richard Strauss and place it in a body. After animation, the \\"new\\" Dr Strauss is encouraged to re- commence his life as a composer of music, which he does. After some difficulty adjusting to the current techniques and theories of musical composition, based largely on random choices on a composition machine, Strauss searches for subjects to inspire him and composes several songs. He then comes across a play by Christopher Fry, Venus Observed, which he realises is an ideal subject for his music. Working to a tight deadline, he completes the opera and conducts its premiere. But during the performance, he begins to suspect that something isn't quite right, and finally realises that he's used all the same musical language many times before and that he has nothing left to say musically. The applause, when it comes, is not for him, but for the mind sculptors, and Strauss realises that it was all an experiment. Before the sculptors pronounce the formulation that will destroy the re-created mind and restore the mind of the donor ‚Äì a man completely devoid of musical ability ‚Äì he feels the satisfaction that the sculptors will never know that the music lacked any spark of genius: \\"the 'Strauss' [they] had created was as empty of genius as a hollow gourd.\\" His final regret is that he will not now be able to set to music Personae, a poem by Ezra Pound appropriate to the occasion that he had just discovered. Commentary In The Worlds of Science Fiction, James Blish writes: > Ostensibly this is a story about the future of serious music, but actually > it proposes no novelties in that field. Its real subject is the creative > process itself ... The story adopts a radical scientific assumption in order > to make a philosophical and emotional point that could have been made in no > other way.

Clarke has performed on both albums, playing guitar, piano and strings on We'll Live and Die in These Towns. He appeared as guest on Noel Fielding's team on the first episode of series 23 of Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Personal life On 14 April 2009, The Sun reported that Tom Clarke had purchased a 1972 Jaguar E Type because it reminded him of his grandfather. The singer said \\"in 1972 my granddad used to work in Jaguar's Brown's Lane plant in Coventry and I wanted a car he'd worked on ‚Äì whenever I look at the car I think of him\\". In January 2010, Gigwise reported that Clarke had acquired a \\"ridiculous farm\\" and was taking a short break from music to decorate. Clarke stated that the band was rehearsing and was writing new Enemy material prolifically. In October 2016, he finished his last Enemy gig by proposing to unsuspecting girlfriend and tour DJ Kate Frost. Gumball Rally In 2009, Tom Clarke drove a Jaguar XKR with in the famous \\"Gumball 3000 Rally\\" an annual 3,000-mile international road rally which takes place on public roads featuring mostly exotic and powerful sports cars. Clarke is alleged to have been landed with a $5,000 bill during the course of the rally for wrecking a hotel suite with friends from Dirty Sanchez, whilst celebrating the band's second album reaching number two in the UK Albums Chart. Monster Energy, one of the rally sponsors, awarded Clarke and his co driver and fellow band member Tom Boddy, The 2009 Monster Energy Award for Bad Behaviour. Car accident On 29 August 2010, The Sun Newspaper reported that Clarke had \\"totalled his new sports car just days after getting it.\\" Clarke said he \\"lost it in the outside lane of the A90 near Aberdeen, The car, a TVR 350c, spun four times before hitting a barrier, then it left the road and went over a bollard before wrapping around a parking sign.\\" The newspaper report said that the singer was not injured, and Clarke compared the crash to the feeling of falling over when trying to put your boxers on. He also urged festival goers to drive safely. Motorcycle injury In March 2009, The Enemy were forced to cancel a performance in Tunbridge Wells when Clarke sustained a hand injury whilst riding his motorcycle. Art gallery bid In June 2010, Clarke backed an art gallery's bid to win the UK's largest single arts prize. The Herbert Art Gallery in Coventry was shortlisted for the ¬£100,000 prize. The singer said winning the award would make The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum a \\"jewel in the crown of Coventry\\". Clarke said, \\"The Herbert means a lot to me personally, as we did one of our first ever gigs downstairs. No band had played here before us, and not many people knew the gallery was here\\". Race For Heroes On 27 February 2010, Clarke participated in the \\"Race For Heroes\\" alongside stars of British motorsport and British soldiers for the Help For Heroes organisation. The six-hour endurance race aimed to raise money and awareness for the charity. XFM controversy In September 2007, Alex Zane, presenter of the XFM Breakfast show broadcast a statement declaring that the band would not be played on his show again. After playing their single \\"You're Not Alone\\" for seven seconds, he reasoned that altercations between himself and the band (notably Tom) over a television interview meant that they would no longer be played by him. He stated that Clarke said \\"disgusting, offensive, hateful things\\".

Catholicism was introduced in Mexico in 1519 by Spain. The majority of Mexicans practice the Catholic faith, however, since the adoption of the current Constitution in 1917, Mexico is a secular nation. History In 1904, the Holy See assigned an Apostolic Delegate as resident representative in Mexico in 1904.Mexico and Vatican Move Toward Restoring Ties The Holy See and Mexico broke diplomatic relations after Mexican President Benito Ju√°rez confiscated church property between 1856 and 1861.Benito Ju√°rez establece la Republica Laica (in Spanish) President Ju√°rez disbanded religious orders and ordered the separation of church and state in the new Constitution of Mexico making Mexico a secular country. Some of the powers of the Catholic Church were reinstated by President Porfirio Diaz.Mexico and the Catholic Church Restore Full Diplomatic Ties In 1926, after several years of the Mexican Revolution and insecurity, President Plutarco El√≠as Calles, leader of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, enacted the Calles Law, which eradicated all the personal property of the churches, closed churches that were not registered with the State, and prohibited clerics from holding public office. The law was unpopular, and several protesters from rural areas fought against federal troops in what became known as the Cristero War. After the war's end in 1929, President Emilio Portes Gil upheld a previous truce where the law would remain enacted, but not enforced, in exchange for the hostilities to end. In 1974, Mexican President Luis Echeverr√≠a paid a visit to the Holy See, becoming the first Mexican head-of-state to do so. In 1979, Pope John Paul II became the first Papal leader to visit Mexico.Bilateral relations between Mexico and the Holy See (in Spanish) In 1992, after more than 130 years, the Mexican Government re-established formal diplomatic relations with the Holy See. That same year, resident diplomatic missions were established in each other's capitals, respectively. In 2016 Pope Francis paid a visit to Mexico.Una persona que piensa en construir muros no es un cristiano (in Spanish) During his visit to Mexico, Pope Francis, in reference to the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier, stated that \\"A person who only thinks of building walls, and not building bridges, is not Christian\\".

Career Financial In 1979, he joined the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade as a commodity trader and order filler for Drexel Burnham Lambert; he eventually became the Vice President of Interest Rate Futures and Options.

While broadcasting from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Santelli accused the government of \\"promoting bad behavior\\", and raised the possibility of a \\"Chicago Tea Party\\". He suggested that individuals who knowingly obtained high-risk mortgages (and faced impending foreclosure as a consequence) were \\"losers\\".

Aslan, the divine creator and protector of Narnia, is envisioned not simply as an analogue to Jesus of Nazareth, but rather as a fantastic alternate version of Christ himself. For example, in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, an allegorical retelling of the Gospels, Aslan offers himself up as a sacrifice in place of the traitorous Edmund, and is mocked, tortured, executed and subsequently resurrected. Aslan himself blatantly alludes to his nature as an alternate Christ in the final scene of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, wherein he reveals to the protagonists Edmund, Lucy and Eustace that in their own world, he is known by \\"another name\\", and that they must learn to know him by that name. *The seventh arc of a popular manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Steel Ball Run shows one of the main characters, 14 year old Lucy Steel, being pregnant with a head of a saint (heavily implied to be Christ) in spite of her being a virgin, being directly influenced by the story of Virgin Mary and the birth of Christ. Devil * For Love of Evil (1988) by Piers Anthony * Melkor is an Ainur, the antagonist of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion and can be seen as the Devil of Tolkien's fictional world. In the creation myth of Ainulindal√´ the Ainur compose the great music before time begins with the harmony being disrupted by Melkor's \\"loud and vain\\" music as he contends with Eru Il√∫vatar (his own creator), attempting to alter the Music and introduce what he believed to be elements purely of his own design. Later Il√∫vatar takes the Ainur to see how the music, at the end of the void, created Arda, the fictional Middle-earth. Melkor then desires to rule Arda and later becomes the source from whom all evil in the world of Middle-earth ultimately stems. * Lucifer is the main character in the comic book series Lucifer (DC Comics) and the tv series Lucifer (TV series). Gods * In Lois McMaster Bujold's Chalion novels, The Curse of Chalion and Paladin of Souls, there are five gods, with substantial consideration of free will and how the gods influence and interact with people. * Small Gods (1992) by Terry Pratchett ‚Äì On the Discworld, the power of a God is determined by how many people believe in them and the God \\"Om\\" has ignored his believers for ages he finds himself stripped of his divine powers and only able to manifest himself as a tortoise. * In Chosen of the Changeling by Gregory Keyes, gods and goddesses are not remote entities, but numerous and everywhere. There is a hierarchy where the smaller and less powerful exists inside rocks and trees, and more powerful ones controls forests and other areas. Especially the smaller ones interact regularly with humans. The most powerful exist simultaneously as four different beings. Heaven * To Reign in Hell (1984) by Steven Brust narrates an alternate account of the War in Heaven, casting Satan as a sympathetic protagonist. Hell * Inferno (1976) by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. * Escape from Hell (2009) by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Morality * The Time Quartet series by Madeleine L'Engle covers a good vs. evil \\"battle\\" over the hearts and minds of children and whole planets. Theocracy * The Goblin Tower (1968) by L.

Romea (Napo, Loon, April 17, 1934- 1985) was a Filipino composer, writer, director, musical arranger, poet and journalist. He composed the Awit sa Boholhttp://www.bohol.ph/article35.html or Bohol hymn and many school anthems. Biography Born in Napo, Loon, Bohol, who later settled in Maribojoc with his wife Jesusa Dalugdug (also from Napo) and family because they were able to acquire a property there. Romea taught at the Bohol School of Arts and Trades (BSAT) now CVSCAFT. Romea was commissioned to pen the Bohol Provincial Hymn. It was first sung publicly by a female choir of the College of Holy Spirit of Tagbilaran City on March 1, 1970, in time for the unfurling of the Bohol Flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1970 East Visayan Athletic Association held in Tagbilaran City. On September 24, 1970, the Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 215 adopting it as the official song of the province of Bohol. As the hymn's original version was in English, the Provincial Board, a few years after, endeavored to have it translated into the vernacular. Competition was launched, and the entry of Maxelende Ganade emerged as the best and was adjudged the winner. The Boholano version was adopted by the Provincial Board in Resolution No. 151 dated September 13, 1974. Romea also composed many school anthems like University of Boholhttp://www.universityofbohol.com or UB Hymn, BSAT Hymn, Saint Joseph Institute of Technology in Butuan City, and he is best remembered for the love song \\"Ako Kang Paabuton,\\" the folk song \\"Sa Daplin sa Baybayon\\" as well as most of the songs featured in the annual 'drama' presentations in his native Napo for which he served as writer, director and musical arranger.http://www.bohol-island.com/loon/lights.htm Nong Tining was also a revered columnist of Bohol Chronicle. In fact, his column was in the frontpage of the Bohol Chronicle defying editing rules. Father's side Romea's father Bernardo \\"Leon\\" Vidal Romea was a rondalla trainer, scriptwriter, director and musical Arranger for the \\"Drama\\" in Napo, Loon, Bohol. Bernardo or \\"Pantaleon\\" or \\"Leon\\", as he was more popularly known, was born on March 12, 1895, in Barangay Napo to spouses Marcelo (Oyong Eloy) and Maria (Oyang Iyay) Vidal, a second wife. His grandparents were Domingo Romea and Cecilia Ordubanes of Barangay Taytay. After completing his elementary education and the first year of high school, the latter at Bohol High School, he qualified for a teaching post, a feat in those days. On June 16, 1910, at age 15, he was appointed a temporary teacher in Loon. A few years later, he passed the teachers' examinations and went on to become principal for 19 years. Romea's command of the English language was grammatically flawless. He bought American books and subscribed to local English magazines (e.g. Free Press, Graphics, etc.) hoping that his children would love or develop the habit of reading. They indeed became bookworms and their communication skills improved. His passion for music was such that he composed songs, organized rondallas wherever he was assigned to his teaching career and promoted and participated in competitions. This went on even after his retirement years. He could skillfully play any of the string instruments in the rondalla but was at his best with the banduria. Romea was keen in distinguishing the slightest discord that at times during rondalla rehearsals, he would suddenly wave a hand for a pause just to tune up a dissonant instrument. Romea was also called a \\"dramaturgo\\" for he wrote and directed stage plays or \\"drama\\" which always served as the culminating feature of the barrio fiesta celebration in Napo. In fact, he is acknowledged as the original playwright, director and composer‚Äìmusical arranger of Napo's stage plays that are now mounted on May 25 of each year without fail. It is believed that Napo holds the record of staging the longest running series of annual plays in Bohol, if not the whole country. Songs Ako kang Paabuton Music by Atty.

Here‚Äôs where the early heroes lived, Here‚Äôs where they wrought peace and here they bled, Here rise the marvelous cone-shaped hills, Here‚Äôs sweet kinampay grows. Blessed with white sandy beaches, Rivers that water valley, Seas teem with fishes and cows graze on the plains, In ev‚Äôry home love reigns, God keep my homeland always free, Let her forever be, I pledge my strength, my heart, and soul, To my close home, Bohol.

Bergmann Mars The Bergmann Mars was produced in 1901, and was the first Bergmann design aimed squarely at the military market, with a comparatively powerful 9√ó23mm Bergmann round. It aroused the interest of a number of armies and was the subject of several trials in competition with the Mauser C96, Mannlicher, Browning and Luger pistols. Model 1903 The Bergmann‚ÄìBayard Model 1903 was adopted by the Spanish army in 1905 as the Pistola Bergmann de 9 mm. modelo 1903. Unable to find a German manufacturer to complete the Spanish order for 3000 pistols, Theodor Bergmann turned to a Belgian manufacturer, Anciens Etablissements Pieper (who used the trademark \\"Bayard\\") and who completed the order. The modified pistol was known as the Bergmann Bayard 1908 (not to be confused with Pieper-Bayard 1908), or in Spain as the Pistola Bergmann de 9 mm. modelo 1908. Although adopted in 1908 delivery of the approximately 3,000 weapons was not completed until two years later. Meanwhile, other manufacturers such as Campo-Giro had adopted the 9mm Bergmann‚ÄìBayard round and, due to its long history of use in Spanish submachine guns, carbines and pistols, today it is most commonly known as the 9mm Largo. Model 1910 and Model 1910/21 At the same time the Bergmann‚ÄìBayard model 1910 was adopted by the Danish military. A total of 4,840 M1910 Bergmann Bayards was initially delivered to the Danish Army. The pistol was produced in Belgium until 1914, when production ceased during World War I and never resumed. The Bergmann‚ÄìBayard was later produced in Denmark from 1922 to 1935. Several modifications to the original design, such as an improved extractor and bolt; a screw to retain the sideplate instead of a spring-loaded catch; and a new grip design extending the full length of the backstrap to the frame were made. The original grips were made of Trolit, a checkered plastic material similar to Bakelite. It was, however, prone to chipping and warping, and the majority of new 1910/21 models was fitted with checkered wooden grips. More than 2,200 Danish Bergmann‚ÄìBayard pistols were produced in Copenhagen. In addition, most of the prewar M1910s delivered to the Danish army by AEP were converted to meet the new specifications. These were restamped \\"M1910/21\\" beneath the Societe Anonyme Anciens Establissments Pieper on the left side of the barrel extension. The last Danish 1910/21 models were built in 1935, but they remained standard issue for the Danish military until 1946 when they were replaced by the Browning Hi-Power. {align=\\"center\\" -valign=\\"bottom\\" Danish 9 mm Bergmann M1910/21 pistol, left view.

Comparatively speaking these are very rare, and had a distinctive wooden grip fitted and changed markings, but seem to have been mechanically identical. Greece also adopted the pistol in 1913 (presumably the Model 1910) but no deliveries are believed to have taken place due to the outbreak of war.

Born and raised in urban New Jersey, Searle moved to rural Minnesota in 1947 with his wife Jane and their two young children. With no prior experience in agriculture, they moved to a farm, and soon were raising crops and livestock. He also became heavily involved in community activities. Searle was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1956, and spent 24 years as a legislator, and had a particular emphasis in education. In 1979 he was selected by an evenly divided body as Speaker. Searle retired from the legislature after the 1980 session but continued in public service, serving in a variety of public and private volunteer positions for the remainder of his life. He died at his home on January 5, 2014. Early life Rod Searle was born July 17, 1920, in Camden, New Jersey to Ruby Marie Barus Searle, a nurse, and newspaper editor William A. Searle. He recalled seeing Babe Ruth hit a home run at Shibe Park in nearby Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Searle graduated from Haddonfield Memorial High School in Haddonfield, New Jersey. During World War II he worked for Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, New Jersey and went to night classes at Rutgers University. Searle married Janette (Jane) E. Christie on May 17, 1941. In 1946 they began considering relocating from the industrial East to the rural Midwest.Searle (1990), p. xiii. Eight months later, in April 1947, the Searles and their two small children made the move, which Searle later characterized as \\"nearly traumatic at the time\\", but \\"turned out to be the biggest and wisest decision of our lives\\". They began farming 280 acres of run-down land in rural Waseca County, Minnesota in partnership with Robert Christie III, his brother-in-law, in a career for which they were neither trained nor educated. They obtained advice from the agricultural Experiment Station at Waseca, a branch of the University of Minnesota Waseca,History, Southern Research and Outreach Center , University of Minnesota (2009). the county extension agent, and neighbors. They grew crops, tended a small dairy herd, and raised sheep and chickens. They involved themselves in community activities, and Searle was president of the Parent-Teacher Association for the Janesville school system and also led the Waseca County Dairy Herd Improvement Association. He chaired the Waseca County Red Cross, and was in the Janesville-Waseca Squadron of the United States Air Force Auxiliary Civil Air Patrol. He was active in the local Mason lodge, the Episcopal Church, and Republican Party, chairing the Waseca County executive committee of the party. Searle resumed his college education, transferring his credits earned at Rutgers and attending classes part-time at Minnesota State University, Mankato, obtaining his BA in 1960 while a legislator. Legislative career Searle was first elected to represent Waseca County in 1956. He was a part of the Conservative caucus during the period in which Minnesota's legislature was officially nonpartisan. When the legislature started using partisan designations in 1975 he was a Republican. He served on a number of committees, and at various times was Chair of the Higher Education, University and College, and University committees, and Chair of the Education Division of the Appropriations Committee. Searle was named Assistant Minority Leader by his caucus in 1975. After the election of 1978, the house was divided equally between Independent-Republicans and the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Searle was chosen as speaker in a compromise between the two parties. He later acknowledged the \\"unique opportunity\\" as speaker of an evenly divided House, and said of this period: \\"Out of necessity, and challenged by the legislative concerns of the times, raw politics was minimized, and a system of balance, cooperation and mutual respect produced workable solutions to the problems that confronted us.\\" In May 1979, Democrats gained a seat, giving the party a majority in the body, and selected Fred C. Norton as Speaker. Searle was named Minority Leader by his caucus. Later career Searle retired from the House after conclusion of the 1980 session. In later years, as the Minnesota Republican Party moved further to the right, Searle became an independent, stating \\"My party has abandoned me.\\" In 2010 Searle was among a group of Republican former lawmakers who endorsed Independence Party candidate for governor Tom Horner, rather than the Republican-endorsed candidate, Tom Emmer. The state Republican party took action against those in the group, preventing them from serving as delegates to the state or national party conventions for two years. After retirement from the legislature, Searle was president of the Minnesota State University Board, chair of the Minnesota College Merger Board, and chair of the Minnesota Higher Education Board. He served as Chair of the Upper Mississippi River Basin Commission. He also volunteered for the Minnesota Agricultural Interpretive Center (\\"Farmamerica\\"), and the Waseca County Historical Society, which he also served as a member of its board of directors. pp. 1, 2.

Early life John Colin Scott was born in Haumoana, Hawke‚Äôs Bay on 9 June 1924, the third of seven children of Kathleen Hiraani Blake and Charles Hudson Scott, a farmer. His mother and father both had British ancestry, while his father was also a descendant of Te Arawa. John Scott had a typical Hawke's Bay childhood, riding to Haumona School on horseback. Then attending St John's College in Hastings where he was head prefect and captain of the school's First XV rugby team. After leaving school he found work as a shepherd, before volunteering for the air force as the Second World War came to an end. In 1946 he studied at the School of Architecture at Auckland University College, but he was unsure of what he wanted to do. He disliked the university academic environment and by 1950 he reduced himself to studying part-time. Scott never achieved his architecture diploma from the College, but he was influenced by teachers Vernon Brown and Bill Wilson. In 1951 he married Wilson's sister-in-law Joan Moffatt in Auckland. Architectural career Futuna Chapel viewed from the south east Our Lady of Lourdes, Havelock North St Canice's, Westport After leaving University he worked for two architectural firms. later he decided to move back to Haumona in the Hawke's Bay with his wife and work for himself. His initial jobs were mostly private houses, like the Savage House and the Falls House in Havelock North (1952‚Äì53). As he developed his individual style, he became inspired by traditional New Zealand buildings such as the whare and woolshed, elements of which can be seen in his later work. Much of his work is characterised by strong geometric shapes. His first church was designed for St John's College in Hastings (1954‚Äì56). This led to the commission of a Marist chapel in Karori, Wellington. This project, the Chapel of Futuna (1958‚Äì61) is arguably the best work of his career, and is recognised nationally and internationally. The chapel incorporates ideas from a whare - a central pole, ribs of rafters and low eaves. The building won the New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal in 1968, and the first 25-year Award in 1986. Scott mostly worked on private commissions, many of which were located in the Hawke‚Äôs Bay region where he grew up. One of Scott‚Äôs last projects before he died was John‚Äôs House, a holiday accommodation located in Havelock North. This was the second home that decorated World War II veteran John Pattison commissioned John Scott to build, and it was completed in 1990.John's House Designed by Architect John Scott Besides public commissions, Scott designed several other public buildings. The Maori Battalion Memorial Centre in Palmerston North (1954‚Äì64) used carved panels and tukutuku for decoration. The Urewera National Park Headquarters building (1974‚Äì76) was designed as a pavilion to suit the neighbouring bush, and shows that sense of place and landscape were critical to his architectural thinking. Death and subsequent recognition John Scott died on 30 July 1992 in Auckland after a major heart operation. In 1999 he was awarded another gold medal by the New Zealand Institute of Architects for his unique contribution to architecture.John Scott: Architect Retrieved: 20 February 2009 See also * Futuna Chapel * St Canice's Church, Westport References External links *John‚Äôs House - One of John Scott‚Äôs Last New Zealand Projects *John Scott: Architect *Friends of Futuna Charitable Trust Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:People from the Hawke's Bay Region Category:1924 births Category:1992 deaths Category:20th-century New Zealand architects Category:Recipients of the NZIA Gold Medal Category:People educated at St John's College, Hastings Category:Te Arawa ","title":"John Scott (architect)"},{"id":"21619721","text":"The Newark Bears is the name of four different sports teams: * Newark Bears, a team that played from 1998 to 2013 in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball and Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball. * Newark Bears (International League), the original baseball team beginning in 1917 that last played in 1949. * Newark Bears (AFL), a 1926 team of the first American Football League. * Newark Bears, a name used by a descendant of the Orange/Newark Tornadoes after it was bought by the Chicago Bears ","title":"Newark Bears (disambiguation)"},{"id":"21619734","text":"'Marie d'Albret, Countess of Rethel, Countess of Nevers (25 March 1491Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Gascony, Dukes and Nobility ‚Äì 27 October 1549) was the suo jure Countess of Rethel, a title which she inherited at the age of nine upon the death of her mother, Charlotte of Nevers, Sovereign Countess of Rethel, on 23 August 1500.

Conidiophores with this pathogen are dichotomous branched, eventually end with two teeth or sterigmata and on each sterigma is formed one conidia. Peronospora hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina is a plant pathogen infecting tobacco that causes blue mold. It is an oomycete (a fungus-like organism) that is highly destructive toward seed plants. It is very prevalent in humid farming zones, like the southeastern and eastern U.S., Canada, and countries bordering the Caribbean. The disease was first identified in 1921 in Florida and Georgia.Ivors, Kelly, and Asimina Mila. \\"Burley and Flue-cured Tobacco: Blue Mold.\\" North American Plant Disease Center Forecast. 16 July 2007. Web. 3 March 2010. Ten years later the same disease was found once again in the same region of the U.S. The disease began to spread into Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. A few years later, the disease reached Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1960, a blue mold epidemic spread in approximately eleven countries. There was approximately twenty five million dollars in losses which is nearly thirty percent of tobacco plants at the time. Each year, Peronospora hyoscyami is introduced as blue mold as windblown spores from outside the region by infected transplants. Symptoms Tobacco plants with an upright position of small patches of the seed bed are typically early signs of blue mold. These leaves are usually in diameter, and normally spotted with yellow, gray, or a bluish mold in the lower surface. Younger plants that are up to four weeks old and are affected by the disease are easily killed by the oomycete. Older plants become deformed and dark, indicating that parts of the plant are dead. In more severe cases the stem and root become infected and turn to a brownish color. The observation of downy mold in the lower surface of the leaf is the most reliable symptom of blue mold. Downy mold carries thousands of small reproductive units called conidiaZhang, Shouan. \\"Plant and Soil.\\" SpringerLink. Springer Netherlands, 2 November 2004. Web. 4 March 2010. If conidia forms at different spots in the seedbed an outbreak is more than likely to occur. The symptoms usually take place before it's obvious. The symptoms evolve rapidly and are typically noticeable over night. The oomycete frequently takes place when the vein of the leaves reaches vascular tissue of the stem, causing weakness and lodging. This infection is called \\"systemic infection\\". The infection causes a stunt in growth and the leaves become narrow and short. The vascular system of the plants usually turns brown in color and the weakened stalk usually causing the stalk to fall over. The mould is highly weather sensitive. During the time when the weather is cool, wet, or overcast the disease can evolve in a greenhouse or field. The disease spreads rapidly because of the pathogen. The rate of continental spread is based on the potential for high levels of inoculum and effective wind spores. When the weather is clear, dry, and hot the disease usually stops spreading and more than likely stops all together. Spreading the disease A major way blue mold spreads is by the distribution of infected transplants. Even though they may appear to be healthy they can still hold the infection. Farmers generally buy transplants from other growers, and take risks of possibly buying diseased plants. If these plants are diseased they are risking their other plants of getting blue mold. This can affect their entire region of their tobacco plants. A five to seven-day symptom-free plant takes place before the first appearance of a diseased plant is visible. When weather conditions are reasonable, a second set of spores evolves around a seven to a ten-day period. If these plants are not chemically treated quickly, the cycle may be repeated several times during the growing season. This can cause a huge epidemic causing many plants to be infected. Blue mold has been found to appear three times each week from March to August.Main, Charels E., Thomas Keever, Gerald J. Holmes, and Jerry M. Davis. \\"Forecasting Long-Range Transport of Downy Mildew Spores and Plant Disease Epidemics.\\" APSnet. The American Phytopathological Society, Apr. 2001. Web. 3 March 2010. Host-pathogen interaction After the germination of conidia, the initial penetration of the host depends on the formation of appressoria near the stomata. This is largely due to a response of P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina to topographical cues of the host such as stomatal openings.Lucas, G.B. (1980). The war against blue mold. Science, USA 210, 147‚Äì153. Upon entry of an infection peg through a stomatal opening, hyphae grow and develop between plant cells. When hyphae reach a photosynthetic mesophyll cell a peg penetrates the cell and establishes a haustorium which the oomycete uses to absorb the necessary nutrients for its own growth.Borras-Hidalgo, O., Thomma, B.P.H.J., Silva, Y., Chacon, O., and Pujol, M. (2010). Tobacco blue mould disease caused by Peronospora hyoscyami f. sp. tabacina. Molecular Plant Pathology 11, 13‚Äì18. Through the establishment of haustoria the pathogen develops an intimate relationship with the host. In doing so P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina efficiently redirects the nutrients of the host and delivers effector proteins into the host cytoplasm that suppress the host defense response. Tobacco defense to P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina The activation of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) has shown to be an effective management strategy for P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina. It has been documented that an accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) and increased activities of peroxidase, Œ≤-1, 3-glucanase, and chitinases have been shown to be associated with induced resistance in tobacco to P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina.Ye, X.S., Pan, S.Q., and Kuc, J. (1990). Association of pathogenesis- related proteins and activities of peroxidase, beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase with systemic induced resistance to blue mould of tobacco but not to systemic tobacco mosaic virus. Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology 36, 523‚Äì531. In addition, PR proteins have been shown to have antifungal activities in vitro and thus are thought to be a key component in the resistance of tobacco to blue mold. Of the tobacco defense responses to P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina SAR has been characterized as the best activated response to blue mold. In addition to SAR, tobacco plants have been found to secrete Œ≤‚Äìionone and T-phylloplanin which both inhibit the sporulation and growth of P. hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina. T-phylloplanin proteins are secreted by tall glandular trichomes on the aerial surface of tobacco leaves and may be a novel leaf surface defense molecule in tobacco.Shepherd, R.W., Bass, W.T., Houtz, R.L., and Wagner, G.J. (2005). Phylloplanins of tobacco are defensive proteins deployed on aerial surfaces by short glandular trichomes. Plant Cell 17, 1851‚Äì1861. Prevention The disease is getting harder to manage and is becoming a problem.Gayed, S.K. \\"Blue Mold of Tobacco.\\" Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs. Ontario, Aug. 2009. Web. 4 July 2010. The way to prevent the disease is to manage crops and protect plants with fungicides when they are most vulnerable while taking control of the crops early on. Making the environment less favorable for the pathogen to survive and protect the tobacco will prevent its growth and spread and it is imperative to always keep the pathogen out of tobacco and the area for as long as possible. Farmers are also always able to grow their own plants rather than purchase them from others which should reduce the chance of planting diseased plants.

Sexuality and disability is regarding the sexual behavior and practices of individuals with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities have a range of sexual desires and differ in the ways they choose to express their sexuality. Commonly, people with disabilities lack comprehensive sex education that would assist in their sexual lives. This roots from the idea that people with disabilities are asexual in nature and are not sexually active. Although some people with disabilities are asexual, it is a misconception to label all as such. Many people with disabilities lack rights and privileges that would enable them to have intimacy and relationships. When it comes to sexuality and disability there is a sexual discourse that surrounds it. The intersection of sexuality and disability is often associated with victimization, abuse, and purity. For physical disabilities that change a person's sexual functioning, such as spinal cord injury there are methods, that assist where needed. An individual with disabilities may enjoy sex with the help of sex toys and physical aids (such as bed modifications), by finding suitable sex positions, or through the services provided by a qualified sex worker.  History  Much of the sexual biases in the United States are traced back to Puritan ethics. Issues on the acceptance of sexuality and disability root back to 2000 years. The review of history on sexuality in philosophy, religion, and science leads to the modern day views on sexuality and disability. Religious institutions were the first entities to combat sexuality. They believed that sex was a sin and should not be practiced unless it was done with intents of reproducing. Then doctors began developing medical views on sex. Sexual pleasure was deemed a sickness. The taboo around sexuality being a disease and sin restricted many people from expressing their sexuality, especially people with disabilities. After much groundbreaking research, it was not until the 20th century that sex and pleasure became normalized. With the normalization of sex, pleasure became the main focus. Healthy sex meant a good performance that led into an orgasm. If a person was not able to orgasm during sex they were seen as inadequate for sexual intercourse. With this a sex therapist would help the individual explore oral sex, and clitoral orgasm. When a person with a disability is not able to achieve an orgasm it was not seen as problematic, because they did not have sexual desires. The neglect on the sexual lives of people with disabilities roots from the idea that they are child like and asexual. Because people with disabilities do not fall under the category of being sexual, there were no resources for them to seek sexual assistance. Over the years sexually disenfranchised groups were working towards sexual acceptance for all people, including queer and disabled communities. The work of these groups began to open doors for people with disabilities to become more expressive of their sexuality. Even with these new found opportunities, sexual pleasure for people with disabilities remained unspoken of. Self-image Having a disability may sometimes create an emotional or psychological burden for the individual with disabilities. They may feel inhibition about pursuing relationships, fearing rejection on the basis that they have a disability. Self-image may suffer as a result of disfigurement, or lack of confidence. A New York disabled dating service manager explains, \\"Sexuality, travel, mobility, pain: Everything takes on a different dimension.\\" In The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability, Miriam Kaufman points out that attempting to hide a disability or minimize its existence is ultimately an added burden, encouraging readers to \\"come out\\" to themselves as having a disability, to accept their disability. There is often fear associated with the intersection of sexuality and disability. Many people with disabilities embody a fear of being rejected due to the way they look. This hypersensitivity causes the individual with disabilities to keep interactions platonic. Author of Sex and Disability Robert McRuer studied a man with disabilities. McRuer gave insight on the individuals sexual and non- sexual encounters. This man had a belief that crossing the line into sexual encounters meant it would cause severe bodily harm for him. During a sexual encounter, the man felt very uncomfortable and could not cross the sexual boundary. This was due to his fear of being judged. This is an issue common in some people with disabilities. The \\"evaluative gaze\\" coming from others causes people with disabilities to feel judged and uncomfortable in their own bodies. It is a common misconception that people with disabilities are insecure and have a negative self-image. A study was done on 7 adolescents with cerebral palsy, to assess their self-image. Of the group there were 3 girls and 4 boys, ranging between 12 and 17 years old. A personality inventory was conducted and the results came out to be positive. The group of adolescents with disabilities viewed themselves very positively, rating their self-image higher than norm groups. After the inventory, the interviewer Lena Adamson came up with this conclusion in her brief report- Self-image, Adolescence and Disability. American Journal of Occupational Therapy. > \\"The following conclusions are made: Further studies on self-image and the > psychosocial development of adolescents with disabilities should (a) focus > on the social interaction outside their immediate families, and (b) continue > to use and develop methods where these adolescents can give voice to their > own experiences and opinions.\\"  In contemporary society  Individuals with disabilities are rarely regarded in society as sexy or believed to be sexually active. When sex and disability are linked, it is common for marginalization to occur. Many people shy away from the idea that individuals with disabilities can have sex. This is due to a lack of information on the subject. Popular scholarly texts on disability rarely discuss sex, conversely disability is rarely discussed in the field of sexuality studies. Disability studies is a new field, it is just recently beginning to have a voice in the scholarly communities. Cultural theory on HIV and AIDS is one area of study that has broadly considered disability and sex. Since the AIDS epidemic the queer community have been including physical and intellectually Individuals with disabilities in their activist interventions. But even with these efforts, the correlation between sexuality and disability are not discussed in disability studies. In society it is widely believed that women with disabilities are asexual. One reason for this belief is that Individuals with disabilities are seen as eternal children. Others see the intertwine of sex and disability as an acrobatic act. It is difficult for many people to imagine an Individual with disabilities having sex, because of the restricting impairments. Viewing women with disabilities as asexual has its issues. In contemporary United States women with disabilities are not viewed as physically attractive because society does not view them as sexually desirable. This results in women with disabilities to be limited and constrained to love and be loved. In the United States pleasure and sex have been largely ignored, especially when it comes to Individuals with disabilities. Medical facilities, public schools, and religious groups have created a \\"don't ask don't tell policy\\" when it comes to sex education. The United States government has spent over 500 million dollars funding a program that restricts public schools from teaching sex in the classroom. The idea is that people should remain abstinent until marriage. This dominant idea has silenced many public institutions. In society sex is portrayed appropriate only for single, young, heterosexual and able bodied people. Because of this spaces to express sexuality are minimized for Individuals with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities are marginalized so the intersection of sexuality and disability is not recognized. When an individual is sexually active, they tend to exclude people with disabilities from their sexual space. These attitudes have served to shun out personal and public sexual pleasure for Individuals with disabilities. In mainstream media people who are disabled are absent when it comes to sexual portrayals. This is also true when it comes to medical and scientific literature. The biological idea that sex is meant for reproduction has been damaging to the sexual lives of Individuals with disabilities. Because some disabilities restrict an individual from having children, the idea of this person having sex is eliminated. After this the individual with disabilities is no longer a candidate for reproduction. This social cultural viewpoint creates the need in society to protect Individuals with disabilities from harm, by keeping them away from all sexual encounters. Sexual activity General The mechanics of sex may be daunting, and communication, experimentation, medication and manual devices have been cited as important factors for sexual activity where disability is involved. Additionally, recognition of the pleasure that is derived from sexual activity beyond penetration and intercourse is also highlighted. For example, changes may take place in a person's sexuality after spinal cord injury; sensitivity to touch can increase above the lesion location in someone with a spinal injury. From research undertaken by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, orgasm was achievable for 79% of men with incomplete spinal cord injuries and 28% of men with complete injuries. Oral sex is another alternative where penetration is not possible or not wanted, and wedge devices can be used to aid with positioning‚Äîwedges can be used as an aid in sex generally. Sex toys may be used as assistive devices as well; for example, vibrators can be used to provide extra stimulation and in circumstances where hand mobility is impaired. Other supportive devices include manual stimulation pumps, for erection promotion and maintenance, and \\"sex furniture\\", whereby rail or clamp enhancements, or specialised designs facilitate sexual activity. Writer Faiza Siddiqui sustained a serious brain injury that led to a decrease in her sexual drive and the loss of her ability to orgasm, with the latter most likely the result of damage to Siddiqui's hypothalamus. Siddiqui explained her learning process in relation to sexual activity following the accident in a 2013 article: > I had to clear away all the thoughts I had about my imperfect body ... Since > then, I've started to feel less shame about my unresponsive body ... My > brain can't concentrate on as many things anymore, so I have to focus more > on every little twinge and the lightest of touches. Surely that's going to > mean better sex? I can't say that the sex is exactly better ‚Äì I can't be on > top anymore ‚Äì but I'm learning that it doesn't really matter ... I had to > grow up. Growing up is something that we're all having to do. Some people with a spinal cord injury are able to \\"transfer their orgasm\\" using sexual energy to any part of the body that has sensation. For example, Rafe Biggs acquired a spinal cord injury in 2004. Through his work with a sexologist he discovered during a massage that when his thumb was being massaged; it felt very similar to his penis.Biggs, Rafe. \\"Strange Sex ‚Äì Surrogate Manhood (Pt.1).\\" YouTube. Rebiggs1, 30 Apr. 2011. Web. 01 Mar. 2016. It was through this experience that he learned that he could transfer his orgasm, using tantric energy, to his penis. Kenneth Ray Stubbs also has a spinal cord injury and is able to use tantric bodywork to obtain an \\"orgasmic feeling\\".Tzigany, Becca, and Kenneth Stubbs. \\"Sexual Shamanism.\\" YouTube. YouTube, 27 Sept. 2014. Web. 02 Mar. 2016. If a person is able to use sexual energy correctly then they would be able to experience an orgasm in any part of the body that is capable of feeling sensation.  Fetishes and BDSM  Sexuality for people with disabilities is often linked to fetishes and \\"freakish excess.\\" * Abasiophilia is when an individuals sexual arousal is dependent on a sexual partner with a disability. The obsession is most common for people with disabilities who wear leg braces. * Apotemnophilia is self demanded amputation. Apotemnophilia is when an individual amputates his own limb for sexual pleasure. A case research done in the Journal of Sex Research states \\"Apotemnophillia is related to erotization of the stump and to overachievement despite a handicap.\\" Little is known about the relationship between sexual pleasure and amputated limbs. This is due to the fetish being fairly new. Apotemnophilia was first introduced to the public in the magazine Penthouse in late 1972. The fetish was brought up by a young man with a disability who practices this fetish. After reading his accounts some editors of the magazine related with this feelings and published his story. Some individuals who have this fetish, have made successful amputation attempts. For those who want to be amputated but do not have the means or strength to do so, are able to get professional assistance. * Devotism is the sexual attraction someone has for a person with disabilities Sex and disability does not only have an unattractive connotation. Sex and Disability writer Robert McRuer found that Devotism had renewed self-assurance in a group of women with disabilities. He writes \\"Women who had felt profound shame about their bodies reported significant gains in their self-confidence after discovering devotees.\\" This empowerment has led to positive changes in the women's behavior. It has been reported by Robert McRuer that because of this some women with disabilities are more confident in their self-image and do not hide their disabilities as they previously have. People who have a devotism fetish are referred to as Devotees. Robert McRuer argues that devoteeism relies on disgust and desire. The description of the devotees desire come from an ableist assumption that disabled bodies are disgusting. It is typical for a devotees to view themselves as the only people who are sexually attracted to amputees. That they are the only ones capable of desiring a person with disabilities. This belief establishes a ground for Devotees exceptionalism. BDSM is a topic in the sex and disability culture. It has been described as empowering for people with disabilities because of their acceptance of non- normative bodies. BDSM could be used as a way to control pain for people with chronic pain. Bob Flanagan used BDSM to help him cope with his Cystic Fibrosis. His ability to control his own pain excited him as he was known to push himself as far as he could. \\"I was making a mockery out of something serious that had happened to me,\\" said Flanagan when making light of his pain related to Cystic Fibrosis. Flanagan was an artist. He was a writer, an actor, and also created a traveling museum exhibit called \\"Visiting Hours\\" that showed the intersectionality of Cystic Fibrosis and sadism and masochism. In the exhibit, \\"Visiting Hours\\",\\"Visiting Hours: An Installation by Bob Flanagan in Collaboration with Sheree Rose.\\" New Museum. New Museum, n.d. Web. 03 Mar. 2016. museumgoers would experience an environment that was a combination of a children's residential hospital and a BDSM torture chamber. The purpose of this exhibit was to portray Flanagan's pain through a pleasurable lens showing that BDSM could offer some sexual healing.BFITrailers. Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist (1997) ‚Äì Trailer. Accessed March 3, 2016. Women and girls with disabilities are a common focus in fetishism due to their immobility. This makes them especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. Sex work In February 2013, it was reported that citizens with disabilities in the Netherlands were eligible for a government-funded scheme that provided funds to cover up to 12 occasions of sexual service per year. During the same period, Chris Fulton, a campaigner in the UK with cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, called upon the UK government to also provide financial support for sexual services for people with disabilities. Fulton explained: > The idea is to give people with disabilities more of a choice. There's still > a lot of stigma attached [to people with disabilities having relationships] > from research I‚Äôve done and experiences I've had. I think it would be good > to bring the Dutch scheme over here to take away that stigma about people > with disabilities having sex. But it's not just about that. It's about > people with disabilities being accepted when they have relationships ... It > needs to be brought out into the open in a managed and constructive way. In early 2013, former brothel owner Becky Adams spoke with the media about her intention to open a non-profit brothel exclusively for people with disabilities in the UK, which, if launched in 2014, will be the nation's first legal initiative of this nature. Adams stated that she will invest ¬£60,000 into the brothel after suffering a stroke in 2009‚ÄîAdams explained that after the stroke, her \\"eyes were suddenly opened. I was utterly unaware that such a big group was suffering so enormously.\\" If she is approved for a permit, Adams plans to open a two-room service in Milton Keynes, near London, that will be staffed by sex workers and assistants. Adams also founded the Para-Doxies service in 2012, which connects people with disabilities throughout the UK with sex workers‚Äîat the time, Adams ran the service on a completely voluntary, non-profit basis. In April 2013, the service was receiving over 500 enquiries a week from men, women and couples, and was struggling to cope with the demand. A 2011 Australian documentary directed by Catherine Scott, Scarlet Road, explores another aspect of sexuality and disabilities through the life of a sex worker who has specialized for 18 years in a clientele who have disabilities. In 2012, the topic was highlighted in a fictional film based on the real life experience of writer Mark O'Brien. The Sessions portrays the relationship between O'Brien, who survived polio as a child, and a \\"sexual surrogate\\" to whom he loses his virginity. A member of the British Polio Fellowship states that post-polio syndrome, which affects polio survivors later in life, is a little-known condition that could have been explored in the film. A survey conducted by the Disability Now magazine in 2005 found that 19% of female participants would see trained sex workers, compared with 63% of the male respondents. Tuppy Owens, sex therapist and disability professional, explained in 2013 that disabled women \\"don't trust male sex workers to be honourable\\".  LGBT  LGBT people with disabilities face double marginalization. Individuals with disabilities are often either viewed as nonsexual or hypersexual. Because of these misconceptions it is hard to find queer people with disabilities portrayed in healthy sexual lives. During the recent decades, scholars have been working to include disabilities studies into queer theory, with the intentions of normalizing disability in queer and LGBT spaces. Queer and disabled liberation starts with the rejection of historic ideas on sexuality and disability. It is also rare to have a queer person with disabilities portrayed in media. Some movies and literature do exist for the queer disabled communities such as: * Akers, Michael D. (director). 2012. Morgan (film). United Gay Network This movie is about a bicyclist who gets in an accident and becomes paraplegic. After the bicyclist recovers from his injuries, he comes to terms with his sexuality and falls in love with a man. * Alland, Sandra (filmmaker). 2013‚Äì2014. I'm Not Your Inspiration (documentary film series) This is a short documentary series documenting the lives of queer and trans people with disabilities. * Bose, Shonali (director). 2014. Margarita, With a Straw (film). This is a film about a young Indian woman with cerebral palsy who relocates to America for her undergraduate education. The movie follows her complex romantic relationship with a blind woman.  Relationships  Individuals with disabilities access to sexual and emotional partners is restricted by societies de-eroticization of their sexuality. The experiences of individuals with disabilities has shown that the basic human need to form close relationships is as relevant for individuals with disabilities as it is for humans without a disability. Furthermore, the social networks of people with disabilities can be small and this restricts the ability to form new relationships. Society's view of disability also puts pressure of individuals with disabilities in finding relationships. Even though our society has made great strides with creating a more accepting world, individuals with disabilities are still seen as outsiders. Parents prevent their children from asking individuals with disabilities questions which results in them viewing people with disabilities as \\"other\\". While the majority of able-bodied people meet other people in public spaces there are many physical and social barriers. The lack of access to public spaces, whether it be stairs; an absence of menus written in braille; or no ASL interpreters; could make it difficult and almost impossible for an individual with disabilities to go out. Individuals with disabilities also participate in online dating. Not only are there websites that are for online dating, but there are also websites that are solely for people with disabilities finding someone that is also disabled or someone that wants to date an individual with disabilities. Disability stereotypes add to the difficulty and stigma experienced by individuals with disabilities. The following myths about individuals with disabilities have been identified: * Individuals with disabilities don't need sex to be happy. * Individuals with disabilities are not sexually attractive. * Individuals with disabilities are \\"oversexed\\". * Individuals with disabilities have more important needs than sex. * Individuals with disabilities don't need sex education. * Individuals with disabilities can't have real sex. * Individuals with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, should not have children and should not be allowed to have children. According to one survey, up to 50% of adults with disabilities are not in any sexual relationship at all. Online dating sites specifically aimed at individuals with disabilities have been founded to fill this void. Misperceptions from the broader community has been raised as a prominent issue for individuals with disabilities in terms of their own relationships. The head of a disabled dating service explained in 2010: \\"Like anyone else, people with disabilities have different preferences. Someone with good mobility may prefer someone also mobile; others don't limit at all.\\" In a 2012 Sydney Morning Herald, the mother of a man with cerebral palsy explained, \\"It's hard being a parent and this [sexuality] comes up. People see them sitting in their wheelchair think, that's it. They don't see what's going on in their lives and Mark [son] would dearly love a relationship.\\"  Oppression  There is a long history of seclusion and segregation that has affected society's view of people with disabilities. For years people with disabilities have been segregated from society. People with disabilities were often put in institutions against their will because they were deemed \\"weak\\" and \\"feeble minded.\\" While they were in the institutions they would often experience compulsory sterilization a.k.a. forced sterilization.. The types of sterilization would include vasectomies, salpingectomy, and other types as well. None of these were considered dangerous to the person in the institution.10\\\\. ‚ÄúEugenicsArchive.‚Äù Accessed April 19, 2016. . In 1927, the United States Supreme Court case of Buck v. Bell stated that it was permissible to sterilize some people with disabilities against their will. It also stated in the decision that that did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.10\\\\. ‚ÄúBuck v. Bell 274 U.S. 200 (1927).‚Äù Justia Law. Accessed April 25, 2016. However, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court of the United States held that under the Americans with Disabilities Act, individuals with mental disabilities have the right to live in the community rather than in institutions if, in the words of the opinion of the Court, \\"the State's treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.\\" According to a series of interviews taken place in Malta investigating the sexual lives of men and women with intellectual disabilities, most individuals reported that they felt oppressed by the expectations from families and caretakers to not engage in sexual activity or a relationship. As a result of the study, almost all individuals expressed a desire to be able to talk openly about their relationships and spend more time away from the family. And while all people's sexualities are controlled and limited by social norms, people with disabilities feel that they are limited by further factors. Another study in Texas explored the beliefs of the families and caretakers of people with intellectual disabilities on their sexualities. The results proved that the majority of families and caretakers of those with intellectual disabilities believed that those with disabilities should not engage in sexual activity because of the fear that they will be taken advantage of. A resolution to the oppression that people with disabilities face when it comes to sexuality is educating families on these researches and educating the disabled on their own sexualities and life options. Sexual harassment, assault, and domestic violence People with disabilities are no less vulnerable than people without disabilities to harassment, assault, and domestic violence. People with disabilities are more vulnerable to sexual assault than the general public, being targeted due to the physical or mental impairments that they have. The American Journal of Preventive Medicine has published results of a survey that found that males with disabilities are 4 times more likely to be sexually abused. Other studies have shown that for women with disabilities, \\"regardless of age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or class [they] are assaulted, raped, and abused at a rate two times greater than women without disabilities [... the] risk of being physically assaulted for an adult with developmental disabilities is 4‚Äì10 times higher than for other adults\\". It is estimated that 25% of both girls and boys with disabilities will experience sexual abuse before the age of 18. It is also estimated that 20% of these incidents are reported. These rates are much higher than sexual abuse incidents pertaining to nondisabled children. There is a 1 in 4 chance that a girl with developmental disabilities will be molested before the age of 18. This is 10 times higher than the nondisabled population. During the California Committee on Abuse of Person with Disabilities, national statistics estimate the sexual abuse on people with disabilities as such: > \\"By combining national statistics with specific studies, estimate ranges are > as follows: between 39% and 83% of girls with developmental disabilities, > and between 16% and 32% of boys with developmental disabilities will be > subjected to sexual abuse before the age of 18 years. Incidence of sexual > abuse among the population of persons with developmental disabilities was > estimated in 1985 by the California State Department of Developmental > Services to be 70%.\\" A majority of the predators are documented to be the father or stepfather of the victim. This is especially true for females with developmental disabilities. It is estimated that 10% of girls with intellectual disabilities are victims of incest. Females are most likely to be victims of sexual abuse. Studies show 50% of disabled females have experience multiple incidents of sexual abuse and 80% of disabled males experienced 1 incident. The numbers for sexual abuse are so high because the perpetrators are well known to the individual, such as a parent, uncle, aunt, cousin, friend, caretaker or sibling. The statistics on sexual abuse for people with disabilities with disabilities are also high because staff and dependent parents are not adequately trained in identifying sexual abuse. Many staff believe that sexual abuse must be proven before it is reported. The issue with this is that certain disabilities restrict the individual from expressing the experience. Dependent Adults with training in identifying abuse are more effective in protecting the child. Most programs focus on \\"stranger danger\\", which is not effective because most sexual abuse assaults come from the individual's inner circle. With more and more cases of sexual abuse reported towards people with disabilities, organizations and state government have taken action. Training seminars are available online and in person for sexual abuse prevention for people with disabilities. Various groups also provide these training seminars such as The Child Abuse Councils, Disability Conferences, and Sexuality Organizations. Government social service agencies also provide assistance for sexually abused people with disabilities.  Prevention  Several prevention programs against sexual abuse for people with disabilities exist in the United States. * Seattle In Seattle, United States a program called Seattle Project trains individuals with developmental disabilities to prevent sexual assault * Minnesota In Minnesota, the Department of Corrections created a prevention program where children and adults with disabilities are trained in all aspects of abuse prevention. * California In California, there is the Waters Child Abuse Prevention Training Act (WCBTA). This program attempts to provide all children with abuse prevention. Each program caters to the child's age and learning level. In Contra Costa County, California, the WCBTA focuses on the needs of various disabilities and sexual abuse prevention. In Los Angeles County Office of Education they have created a Preschool Abuse Prevention Program for Children with disabilities. In this, teachers are instructed to train students with disabilities on physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.  Resources  People may have concerns about sexual participation after experiencing a disability which can affect that person's quality of life and self-esteem. If you are looking for a professional to talk to about your unique needs you can reach out to social workers, psychologists, sex therapists, and occupational therapists (OT) as well as others. Specifically, occupational therapists can help people navigate intimacy and sexual expression with sensitivity and empathy. OTs are health care providers, who are knowledgeable about sex and sexuality and can work with people to fully experience and enjoy sexual participation. Sex guides depicting various sexual positions, as well as other written material, can be helpful for couples who need to address mobility impairments, as well as for those who are caring for or working with people with disabilities. Such resources, written by people with expertise in disability issues, are in print, including: \\"Sexuality and Learning Disability\\", by Claire Fanstone and Zarine Katrak; The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability, published by Cleis Press, which consists of advice from people with disabilities; and Holding On, Letting Go, a book for parents written by John Drury, Lynne Hutchinson and Jon Wright. The creation of the \\"Sexual Respect Tool Kit\\" was initiated by Alex Cowan, a professional working in the disability field in the UK, and Owens after the Outsiders/Royal Society of Medicine conference \\"Disability: Sex Relationships and Pleasure\\", held in 2009. Cowan, a consultant with multiple sclerosis (MS) who discovered the lack of sex-related support for PWD through personal experience, worked with Owens to form a group of experts, consisting of people such as human rights law lecturer Claire de Than and sex educator Sue Newsome, to further develop the tool kit concept. The finished resource is designed to assist health professionals in the UK to initiate discussions on sex and related matters with people with disabilities. Disability Horizons is a UK magazine co-founded by Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley, who both have spinal muscular atrophy and continue as co-editors. The publication is self-described as a \\"21st Century View of Disability\\" and seeks to \\"help people with disabilities achieve whatever they wish.\\" Disability Now is another UK magazine that is published by Scope, a national cerebral palsy organisation. The publication appointed its first disabled editor in September 2007 and had a circulation of 20,000 at the time. An academic journal founded in 1978, called Sexuality and Disability, is described by its publisher, Springer Publishing, as \\"A Journal Devoted to the Psychological and Medical Aspects of Sexuality in Rehabilitation and Community Settings\\". Its current Editor-in- Chief is Sigmund Hough. PleasureABLE is a sexual device manual, made for people with disabilities. The manual was created to assist any race, gender, age, and sexual orientation with their sexual life. The authors of PleasureABLE believe that sexuality should be embraced, pleasurable, and talked about. PleasureABLE's manual discusses anatomy, routines, safety, devices for physical disabilities, positioning, and safe sex. These topics are geared towards people with disabilities and health care professionals. Organizations Australia The subject of the Scarlet Road documentary, Rachel Wotton, also co-founded and helps run Touching Base, an organization based in New South Wales, Australia that provides information, education and support for clients with disabilities, sex workers and Disability Service Providers. The organization has been active since October 2000 following the formation of the founding committee that consisted of disability and health organization representatives. Wotton explains, \\"I am a sex worker and I make my money from clients seeing me. Some clients just happen to have a disability.\\" Initially, the organization was receiving around one weekly phone call, but by 2012, inquiries were daily. In March 2014, former Australian High Court judge Michael Kirby became a patron of the organization, joining four other inaugural patrons: Eva Cox, Professor Basil Donovan, Associate Professor Helen Meekosha, and NSW Local Government elder statesman Peter Woods. Following his appointment, Kirby stated: \\"If you deny sexual expression to human beings, cut them off from that aspect of their personalities and of their happiness, then you end up with a lot of very frustrated and very unhappy people\\", and he praised Touching Base for recognising that people with disabilities need \\"to have opportunities for sexual expression\\". People with Disability Australia has developed a sex and relationship education workshop for people with intellectual disabilities. United Kingdom *TLC Trust The TLC Trust provides a web-based service that facilitates the provision of sexual services‚Äîsex workers, therapists, and teachers‚Äîfor people with disabilities, including a phone call appointment-booking service for those people with speech impairments or care workers who are unable to organize such services for clients due to the policy of their employer. The TLC Trust was founded in 2000 at a Sexual Freedom Coalition Conference and the website was initially run by James Palmer, a man with disabilities. The organization has garnered praise from sex educator and performance artist Annie Sprinkle, and academic and writer A.C. Grayling. *Outsiders Founded by Owens, Outsiders is primarily an international social club for people with disabilities, but the organization also runs the Sex and Disability Helpline, a telephone support service for people with disabilities that is staffed by both people with disabilities and health professionals. Outsiders is supported by the Outsiders Trust, which consists of a Board of Trustees that assists with the management of matters such as finances and projects. *Sexual Health and Disability Alliance (SHADA) The Sexual Health and Disability Alliance, also founded by Owens, was first started to provide a forum in which all of the UK's disability helpline operators, and others, could meet and discuss their work. The individuals who were initially involved state that they were \\"eager to improve the sex-positive work we do\\" and the Alliance was eventually formalized in 2008 with a mission to \\"bring together health professionals who work with people with disabilities to empower and support them in their sex and relationship needs.\\" The Alliance does not charge a fee for those interested in becoming members and meets biannually in London. It held its first conference in 2009 at the Royal Society of Medicine. *The Disabilities Trust The Disabilities Trust is over 30 years old and is a leading charitable organization in the UK. It states that it provides \\"residential and day services to meet the needs of individuals with Autism, Brain Injury, Physical Disability and Learning Disability\\", as well as helping people to live at home in the community. The Trust has produced written information on sexuality and disability, which are freely available on the Internet.  United States  *Reach Out USA Reach out USA is an advocacy organization that focuses on the relationship between disability and LGBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender) concerns. The group's goal is to influence disabled communities to be more aware of the LGBT communities, and LGBT communities and organizations to be more accountable and welcoming of disabled communities. Reach Out USA also helps out with other topics such as mental illness, suicide, depression and much more. *Queerability Queerability is a LGBT and disabled rights advocacy group that is run by LGBT people with disabilities who hope to increase visibility to the community. The goal of this group is to ensure that the voices of LGBT people with disabilities are heard. The organization gives them a large social platform to express themselves. Queerability does not only advocate for the rights of LGBT disabled communities, but also provides educational sources pertaining to the individuals sexuality and disability.

Portner was born on January 8, 1940 in Mombasa, Kenya. In 1968, he was awarded doctorate in experimental nuclear physics from McGill University in Montreal, which was followed by a postdoctoral fellowship in nuclear physics at the University of Oxford. Portner was hired as a senior physicist at Andros Inc., a research and development firm headquartered in Berkeley, California, that was taken over by Novacor in the 1980s. During the 1970s, first became involved in biomedical engineering while experimenting on a device that attached to the left ventricles of the hearts of laboratory cows in order to restore the heart's pumping ability while obviating the need to remove the heart's chambers. By 1984, this had evolved into the left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which consisted of an electrical pump and bladder that was placed into the chest of the patient, connected by wires to a battery outside the patient's body. The LVAD replaced earlier devices that had run on compressed air, requiring a larger opening in the thoracic cavity that was more prone to infection. The first recipient, 51-year-old Robert St. Laurent, remained on the pump for eight days before his damaged heart was replaced in a transplant operation, and lived for 20 years in stable health before his death in 2004. St. Laurent had had a heart attack and what turned out to be unsuccessful coronary artery bypass surgery, leading to the successful implantation of the LVAD for the first time in a human. The heart St. Laurent received came from an 18-year-old college student who had been brain dead following a car accident.White, Tracie. \\"Peer Portner, pioneer in heart pump surgery at Stanford, dies at 69\\" , Stanford School of Medicine. press release dated February 13, 2009. accessed February 20, 2009. He established the Novacor Medical Corporation in the 1980s to construct and distribute the device, serving as its president and chief executive before the company was acquired by Baxter Healthcare Corporation in 1988. After the takeover, Portner served as chairman of Baxter's Novacor division, where he continued to improve the device, making it easier to transport and allowing patients to wash, walk and be outside the hospital for significant periods of time. By the time of Portner's death, an estimated 1,800 Novacor devices had been implanted to allow for a transition to transplants and in other cases, with devices kept in patients for up to six years. Available since 1993, the wearable version lets patients return to a largely normal lifestyle outside of the hospital. By 1987, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted permission to use Novacor pumps on a case-by- case basis, with doctors at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh indicating that they would use the Novacor pump in lieu of Jarvik hearts until a human donor heart can be found.via Associated Press. \\"Experimental Use of Blood Pump is Planned\\", The New York Times, July 6, 1987.

Name Vrzdenec was attested in written sources as SchoÕ§nprun in 1309, SchoÕ§nprunen in 1343, and Schonprun in 1453, among other transcriptions. The name is a fusion of the phrase *v—årx—ä st—äden—åca, meaning either 'above the spring' or 'source of the spring'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 471. In the past it was known as Sch√∂nbrunn (literally, 'beautiful spring') in German. History Prehistoric finds, including stone and bronze axes, have been found at Tabor Hill, testifying to early settlement of the area. Tabor Hill also had a fortification during the Middle Ages that served as protection against Ottoman attacks. The village came under German bombardment during the Second World War on 1 November 1943. Church Saint Cantius church with the late 16th-century Renaissance fresco of St. Christopher The local church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Cantius and belongs to the Parish of Horjul. It is a Romanesque building, probably dating to the 13th century with poorly preserved traces of frescos from the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries.

The university gradually expanded and enrolled more students, creating a need for more faculties. Ahmad Shah Rafiqi was replaced by Abdul Qadeer Khamosh around the time of the expansion, and after two years he himself was replaced by Mohammad Bayer Darmal who is the current rector. A new campus for the university was constructed in the city's eastern quarter. Two more faculties were added, the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Sharia (Islamic law). The Faculty of Literature & Languages was also later added. On 16 September 2019, a bomb attached to a university minibus exploded, killing one and injuring five.

It starts where the Dragone River flows into the Dolo River in the La Piana locality () and finishes at San Pellegrino in Alpe (), a hamlet (currently a frazione of the commune of Castiglione di Garfagnana) located on the ridge that separates the Tuscan from the Emilian Apennines. It was also called the Imperial Way due to its high toll that had to be paid in order to use it and that it could host a cart drawn by two oxen one beside the other, a luxury for the time. It has a lengthhttp://www.viaggiatori.com italian of 30 kilometers, starting from a height of 360 metres and arriving at a height of 1,529 metres. Now it is used as an amateur trekking path that runs alongside the Strada provinciale 32MO road and in certain stretches shares the same route. History The road dates back to the early Roman times, when the ancient tribe of the Frinati,http://www.provincia.modena.it/Servizi/sentieri italian part of the population of the Liguri, gave battle for over twenty years to the Roman Republic. When the Romans, once defeated the Frinati in 175 BC,Livy managed to settle in the area, they built a thick system of paths and roads. In fact, the name comes from Latin Bi-, meaning \\"two\\", and bulca, meaning \\"oxen\\". According to some historians, however, the road may actually date back to the pre-Roman period.http://www.frassinoro.net italian In the Middle Ages it was called the Via Nova. At the arrival of the Lombards, the road lost most of its importance, though in the 7th century, the Pass of the Radici was opened in order to bypass the remaining Byzantine possessions. The most important era for the road began when the Abbey of Frassinoro was inaugurated by the local ruler Matilda of Tuscany: the abbey overtook by importance the Pieve of Rubbiano, the local main town of the time, that used to collect the tolls for and maintained all the local roads including the Via Bibulca. The road was often a matter of content between the free commune of Modena and the Abbey of Frassinoro: the latter was assigned its care officially in 1164 by Frederick I because of the frequent robberies that took place in the nearby Garfagnana. Along the route were constructed 2 hospices: one over at Saint Geminiano and another one over to San Pellegrino in Alpe. In 1522 Ludovico Ariosto, while going to Garfagnana to take its government, tested the conditions of the road saying that it was an \\"iniquitous road\\".http://www.luna-nuova.it/ValDragone/Itinerari/LaViaBibulca italian Finally in the 18th century other trans-Apennine roads were constructed, including the Via Vandelli: this mostly shared the same old route of the Bibulca, although on the final ridge towards Saint Pilgrim in Alpe moved to another route. Towards the end of the 18th century the Via Giardini road was laid down by the House of Este Dukes, and the Via Bibulca road was abandoned.

Biography Very little is known of Theobald's early life. Theobald was referred to in official documents as \\"William Theobald, Junior\\". He arrived in Calcutta on the ship Hindostan via the Suez in March 1847 and worked as a volunteer in the coal exploration of the upper Damodar and Son valleys under David Williams. During this time Joseph Hooker visited him and they spent time together. Later Theobald became an assistant to John McClelland who took over the exploration from David Williams. He went to Burma in 1855 as a staff of the Geological Survey of India and took over the Pegu survey. He returned Bengal on completion of the survey in 1873 to be appointed Deputy Superintendent of Bengal in 1876.Mabberley DJ (1985). \\"William Theobald (1829-1908): Unwitting Reformer of Botanical Nomenclature?\\".

L. Reeve & Co. p. 65 He even made his shell collections available to Francis Mason for his epic work on the flora and fauna of British Burma titled Burmah, its People and Natural Productions. The third edition of this work was completely rewritten by Theobald and was published in two volumes under the title Burma, its people and productions; or notes on the fauna, flora and minerals of Tenasserim, Pegu and Burma (Hertford, England, 1882 & 1883). The first volume of this work covered geology, mineralogy and zoology and was exclusively written by him while the second volume relied on several important botanical works of his time. The phanerogamic information came from printed works of Sulpiz Kurz on the Burmese flora and from the entries in Edward Balfour's works. He also relied on Le Maout's and Decaisne's general system of botany translated by Mrs. Hooker and on Gamble's Manual of Indian Timbers. However, his efforts at reforming botanical nomenclature conflicted with the British Botanical establishment at that time a majority in British India and his botanical works were largely disregarded. He retired from the service in June 1881 and died at Ilfracombe, Devon, England on 31 March 1908. A photograph of him as member of a group of the Geological Survey of India was published in the Centenary publication of the Geological Survey of India.

Upon ignition, the vapor cloud exploded with tremendous force. Both near- and far-field damage indicate that this explosion may be attributed to the detonation of propane in air with an energy release equivalent to that from about 50 tons of detonating trinitrotoluene (TNT). The violence of the explosion is likely unprecedented. As such, the accident is widely quoted as one of the first, if not the first, confirmed accidental occurrences of an unconfined vapor cloud deflagration that turns into a detonation - a so-called deflagration to detonation transition. The accident represents a \\"worst- possible\\" sort of case history for assessment of the hazards of fuel transportation. The accident took place in Port Hudson, Franklin County, Missouri, on December 9, 1970. The pipeline was owned by Phillips Pipeline Company.

It is scored for piano, violin and cello. In early 1880 Brahms began work on two new piano trios, one in C major, the other in E major. By June he had completed an Allegro movement for each of them, and showed these to Clara Schumann who offered a preference for the E major piece.Misha Donat, liner notes to Hyperion recording, CDA67251/2, 1998. However, the two trio movements were set aside while Brahms worked on his second piano concerto and third symphony, and by the time he picked up the trios again two years later, the self-critical Brahms had decided to destroy the E major Allegro and concentrate on the C major trio, completing the remaining three movements in the summer of 1882 while on vacation in the spa town of Bad Ischl, Upper Austria.James M. Keller, \\"Chamber Music: A Listener‚Äôs Guide\\", Oxford University Press, 2011. The Trio was first performed at a chamber music evening in Frankfurt-on-Main on 29 December 1882 with Brahms' first String Quintet (F major, Op. 88). Both the Trio and String Quintet were published that same month by the firm of Fritz Simrock. The trio is in four movements: A typical performance lasts roughly 27 to 30 minutes.

His work over the last 20 years has focused on dialogue process design and implementation, conflict resolution, conflict early warning, stabilisation, as well as forecasting and strategy. Career history After several years in the humanitarian and public health fields, he was recruited in 1997 to establish the Forum on Early Warning and Early Response (FEWER). His tenure as Director involved the establishment of early warning systems in the North Caucasus, West Africa, and Great Lakes region. Concerned with the absence of responses to warnings, he worked with FEWER members to combine warning systems with multi-stakeholder dialogue and planning processes in Chechnya, DR Congo, Guinea-Conakry, and Georgia. After leaving FEWER in 2003, Nyheim established International Conflict and Security (INCAS) Consulting Ltd. (United Kingdom) together with Anton Ivanov, Samuel Gbaydee Doe, and Tom Porteous. He served as its Chief Executive till 2014, after which he became the Chairman of the INCAS Consulting Ltd. and its affiliated consulting companies.https://incasconsulting.com/ourstory As a consultant, David Nyheim designed and implemented dialogue processes in Indonesia (Christian-Muslim conflicts), Mauritania (government-opposition dialogue on development), Fiji (pre-election stabilisation), and Kyrgyzstan (micro-conflicts and tensions). He worked on several stabilisation initiatives, largely for governments and companies operating in areas affected by criminalised violence. Lessons learnt from his work on preventing petroleum-related violent conflicts were published in \\"Balancing Petroleum Policy: Toward Value, Sustainability, and Security\\" by the World Bank in 2019.https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/full/10.1596/978-1-4648-1384-9_ch11 Most of Nyheim's forecasting and strategy work has been for governments and multinational corporations. In 2003, he co-authored the Peace and Security Strategy (PASS) for Shell Nigeria that accurately predicted serious instability in the Niger Delta. After several years of focused work on the Niger Delta, which included support to later President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, Nyheim returned to the North Caucasus in 2005, where worked with Anton Ivanov and others on a Strategic Reconstruction and Development Assessment for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (United Kingdom). That same year, he developed an integrated aid-reconciliation multi-donor strategy for Myanmar that controversially argued for active engagement with the Myanmar government. Nyheim is considered a leading thinker and practitioner of modern conflict early warning and response. His studies, \\"Preventing Violence, War, and State Collapse. The Future of Conflict Early Warning and Response\\"https://www.oecd- ilibrary.org/development/preventing-violence-war-and-state- collapse_9789264059818-en for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and \\"Early warning and response to violent conflict: Time for a rethink?\\"https://www.saferworld.org.uk/resources/publications/1009- for Saferworld are widely cited. Education David Nyheim received his BA in political science from McGill University (Canada) in 1992. From 1992 to 1994, he studied medicine at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), before joining the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) in 1994. He received his MSc. in economics from the London School of Economics/London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (United Kingdom) in 1996. During this time he served as the chairperson of the Student's Union of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

The Route leads in a westward direction, from The Church of St. John Jerusalem behind the Wall to the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St. Florian. The Royal‚ÄìImperial Route in Pozna≈Ñ is an idea of a tourist product that would combine important places and historical monuments of the city. \\"The Royal ‚Äì Imperial Route\\" axis provides cultural, artistic and educational events that integrate the activities of all parties concerned and are the platform for co-operation of various entities: public administration, culture and science institutions, representatives of the academic circle, and tourist organisations. That is why \\"The Royal‚ÄìImperial Route\\" is Pozna≈Ñ's first complete partner project in which the City Hall motivates the other parties to work for the development of cultural tourism of the city and region. Thematic lines *Route of history \\"Poland began here... ‚Äì Poland began in Pozna≈Ñ...\\". The name of the theme recalls the words of Pope John Paul II, who reminded that the history of Christian Poland (and its statehood) began in Pozna≈Ñ, to some extent together with the European integration, or rather affiliation to the Mediterranean culture instead of Byzantine one. The thousand-year history inscribed in the areas of the old Pozna≈Ñ (from Ostr√≥w Tumski to the Old Town) and the Polish state provide excellent material and inspiration to develop a tourist offer, which could be briefly described with the following sentence: in Pozna≈Ñ you travel to the beginnings of Poland ‚Äì not only in the family context, but also in respect of the national identity. *Route of architecture monuments \\"That is how Pozna≈Ñ was built ‚Äì Route of Work and Beauty\\". Different architectural styles in Pozna≈Ñ: from Romanesque to Secession (Cathedral ‚Äì Town Hall ‚Äì Parish Church‚Äì Castle), and transparent development of both the urban system and cultural content, allow to guide the tourist through successive stages (cultural layers) of the city, from which the history of people who worked and lived here can be traced over the centuries. *Artistic (Cultural) Route \\"Cultural inspirations ‚Äì Route bustling with (cultural) life‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Entertainment/Cultural ROUTing\\". The artistic offer constitutes an important element of cultural tourism. Cultural programs affect the significance of the city on the map of cultural ‚Äì city tourism marketing to a great extent. For that reason the elements of the integrated Tourist Product \\"Royal-Imperial Route in Pozna≈Ñ\\" involve many diversified product programs within this area. *Route of Wielkopolska traditions \\"Not just potatoes with cottage cheese ‚Äì Good Food and Fun\\". Emphasizing one's own local identity through presenting the customs, traditions or values to the public constitutes the only \\"resources\\" exploited for tourist purposes. Yet, presenting the tradition of Wielkopolska Region in Pozna≈Ñ will be a wonderful supplement to the cultural offer of the city, highlighting at the same time its genuine individual character and regionalism. Historic reference The name of The Royal-Imperial Route has its ground in the history of the city. \\"Royal\\" comes from the fact that Mieszko I's palatium served as a residence for the first kings of Poland, whose tombs are located in Pozna≈Ñ Cathedral's crypt. The cathedral is the place of burial of the following rulers: * Mieszko I, (and his wife ‚Äì Dobrawa), * Boles≈Çaw I the Brave, * Mieszko II, * Casimir I the Restorer, * Ladislaus Odonic, * Przemys≈Ç I, * Boles≈Çaw the Pious, * Przemys≈Ç II. The Royal Castle (Zamek Kr√≥lewski), erected on Przemys≈Ç Hill (G√≥ra Przemys≈Ça) at the end of the 13th century as the largest of its time in Poland, was where Polish as well as foreign kings were frequently received. * Casimir III the Great, * Louis I the Great, * Jadwiga of Anjou, * W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, * John I Albert * Casimir IV Jagiellon, * Sigismund I the Old, * Henry of Valois, * Sigismund III Vasa, * John II Casimir Vasa. Pozna≈Ñ was also an emperors' city: * The first emperor to visit the city was Otto III on his way to Gniezno, where in 1000 (AD), together with the Polish sovereign, Boles≈Çaw the Brave, he offered prayers to God at the tomb of St. Adalbert, who is now the patron saint of the European Union. Henry II, Frederick I (Barbarossa) and John of Luxembourg all attempted to take Pozna≈Ñ. Two Tsars, Peter the Great and Alexander I, also paid state visits to the city. * In 1806, Napoleon Bonaparte moved into the Jesuit College for few weeks, from where he commanded his army. * The German Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded Pozna≈Ñ the status of \\"imperial- residence city\\". The castle erected for the Kaiser in 1910 was the last imperial residence built in Europe.

In a post-apocalyptic world, destroyed by a disease, which turns humans into infected strongly resembling vampires, Seagal plays Tao, the leader of a squad of ex-military vigilantes who are attempting to find and rescue a group of survivors trapped in a hospital. This is Steven Seagal's first horror film. The film was released direct-to-video on February 10, 2009.http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2009/0AGTD.php Plot An epidemic disease has overwhelmed humanity, turning nearly everyone into blood-thirsty infected who resemble vampires and zombies. There is no known cure and very few survivors left fighting \\"against the dark\\". Tao (Seagal) is in charge of a group of vampire/zombie hunters. The survivors in the hospital are shown to be scared, isolated and untrusting. As the characters work their way through the hospital, they drift apart numerous times, often getting lost and attacked. To make matters worse for the survivors, a massive army base is planning to bomb the area at dawn. The survivors must get to the one functioning exit from the hospital before the emergency power runs out and they are shut inside. To make matters worse many of the stairways and elevators are blocked off, forcing them to make their way level by level. Meanwhile, Cross (Linden Ashby) tries to prevent Lt. Waters (Keith David) from unleashing a bombing raid on the hospital. A number of survivors and a hunter are killed and a different hunter is infected as they make their way out of the hospital. A survivor is captured by a human to be fed on by his infected daughter, but is rescued by Tao. As the humans make their way out a horde of infected chase them. As they exit the hospital just in time before the power fails the vampires become trapped inside. The surviving humans then run as jet planes bomb the forsaken hospital. Cast Reception Rob Hunter of FilmSchoolRejects.com says that although the film could have been entertaining, \\"the idea and the execution are worlds apart\\" and questions the strange decisions of the survivors. Hunter praises Tanoai Reed as the one bright spot of the film, delivering top-notch fight scenes, even if his acting could do with improvement.

The bar indicates 1 cm. Electrophoresis performed overnight at less than 10 V/cm. The analysis was performed early in the 1970s at the Protein Laboratory Affinity electrophoresis is a general name for many analytical methods used in biochemistry and biotechnology. Both qualitative and quantitative information may be obtained through affinity electrophoresis. The methods include the so- called electrophoretic mobility shift assay, charge shift electrophoresis and affinity capillary electrophoresis. The methods are based on changes in the electrophoretic pattern of molecules (mainly macromolecules) through biospecific interaction or complex formation. The interaction or binding of a molecule, charged or uncharged, will normally change the electrophoretic properties of a molecule. Membrane proteins may be identified by a shift in mobility induced by a charged detergent. Nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments may be characterized by their affinity to other molecules. The methods have been used for estimation of binding constants, as for instance in lectin affinity electrophoresis or characterization of molecules with specific features like glycan content or ligand binding. For enzymes and other ligand- binding proteins, one-dimensional electrophoresis similar to counter electrophoresis or to \\"rocket immunoelectrophoresis\\", affinity electrophoresis may be used as an alternative quantification of the protein. Some of the methods are similar to affinity chromatography by use of immobilized ligands.  Types and methods  Currently, there is ongoing research in developing new ways of utilizing the knowledge already associated with affinity electrophoresis to improve its functionality and speed, as well as attempts to improve already established methods and tailor them towards performing specific tasks.  Agarose gel electrophoresis  an example of an agarose gel after electrophoresis A type of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (AMSA), agarose gel electrophoresis is used to separate protein-bound amino acid complexes from free amino acids. Using a low voltage (~10 V/cm) to minimize the risk for heat damage, electricity is run across an agarose gel.  Rapid agarose gel electrophoresis  This technique utilizes a high voltage () with a 0.5√ó Tris-borate buffer run across an agarose gel. This method differs from the traditional agarose gel electrophoresis by utilizing a higher voltage to facilitate a shorter run time as well as yield a higher band resolution. Other factors included in developing the technique of rapid agarose gel electrophoresis are gel thickness, and the percentage of agarose within the gel.  Boronate affinity electrophoresis  Boronate affinity electrophoresis utilizes boronic acid infused acrylimide gels to purify NAD- RNA. This purification allows for researchers to easily measure the kinetic activity of NAD-RNA decapping enzymes.  Affinity capillary electrophoresis  Affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) refers to a number of techniques which rely on specific and nonspecific binding interactions to facilitate separation and detection through a formulary approach in accordance with the theory of electromigration. Using the intermolecular interactions between molecules occurring in free solution or mobilized onto a solid support, ACE allows for the separation and quantitation of analyte concentrations and binding and dissociation constants between molecules. With ACE, scientists hope to develop strong binding drug candidates, understand and measure enzymatic activity, and characterize the charges on proteins. Affinity capillary electrophoresis can be divided into three distinct techniques: non- equilibrium electrophoresis of equilibrated sample mixtures, dynamic equilibrium ACE, and affinity-based ACE. Nonequilibrium electrophoresis of equilibrated sample mixtures is generally used in the separation and study of binding interactions of large proteins and involves combining both the analyte and its receptor molecule in a premixed sample. These receptor molecules often take the form of affinity probes consisting of fluorophore-labeled molecules that will bind to target molecules that are mixed with the sample being tested. This mixture, and its subsequent complexes, are then separated through capillary electrophoresis. Because the original mixture of analyte and receptor molecule were bound together in an equilibrium, the slow dissociation of these two bound molecules during the electrophoretic experiment will result in their separation and a subsequent shift in equilibrium towards further dissociation. The characteristic smear pattern produced by the slow release of the analyte from the complex during the experiment can be used to calculate the dissociation constant of the complex. Dynamic equilibrium ACE involves the combination of the analyte found in the sample and its receptor molecule found in the buffered solution in the capillary tube so that binding and separation only occur in the instrument. It is assumed for dynamic equilibrium affinity capillary electrophoresis that ligand-receptor binding occurs rapidly when the analyte and buffer are mixed. Binding constants are generally derived from this technique based upon the peak migration shift of the receptor which is dependent upon the concentration of the analyte in the sample. Affinity-based capillary electrophoresis, also known as capillary electroaffinity chromatography (CEC), involves the binding of analyte in sample to an immobilized receptor molecule on the capillary wall, microbeads, or microchannels. CEC offers the highest separation efficacy of all three ACE techniques as non-matrixed sample components are washed away and the ligand then be released and analyzed. Affinity capillary electrophoresis takes the advantages of capillary electrophoresis and applies them to the study of protein interactions. ACE is advantageous because it has a high separation efficiency, has a shorter analysis time, can be run at physiological pH, and involves low consumption of ligand/molecules. In addition, the composition of the protein of interest does not have to be known in order to run ACE studies. The main disadvantage, though, is that it does not give much stoichiometric information about the reaction being studied.  Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  Affinity-trap polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) has become one of the most popular methods of protein separation. This is not only due to its separation qualities, but also because it can be used in conjunction with a variety of other analytic methods, such as mass spectrometry, and western blotting. This method utilizes a two-step approach. First, a protein sample is run through a polyacrylamide gel using electrophoresis. Then, the sample is transferred to a different polyacrylamide gel (the affinity-trap gel) where affinity probes are immobilized. The proteins that do not have affinity for the affinity probes pass through the affinity-trap gel, and proteins with affinity for the probes will be \\"trapped\\" by the immobile affinity probes. These trapped proteins are then visualized and identified using mass spectrometry after in-gel digestion.  Phosphate affinity electrophoresis  Phosphate affinity electrophoresis utilizes an affinity probe which consists of a molecule that binds specifically to divalent phosphate ions in neutral aqueous solution, known as a \\"Phos-Tag\\". This methods also utilizes a separation gel made of an acrylamide-pendent Phos-Tag monomer that is copolymerized. Phosphorylated proteins migrate slowly in the gel compared to non-phosphorylated proteins. This technique gives the researcher the ability to observe the differences in the phosphorylation states of any given protein.

History The group were formed as the Country Gentlemen in 1956 in Alabama by banjo player Rual Yarbrough, mandolin player Herschel Sizemore and guitarist Jake Landers. About that time, another group who went by the name of the Country Gentlemen already existed so Yarbrough's group changed their name to the Dixie Gentlemen. Soon, Jake Landers entered military service but was discharged the next year in 1957. During these early years, they toured the south eastern USA and also made personal appearances on both local radio and television stations. Their efforts bore fruit and they made their recording debut in 1959 for the tiny and obscure Blue Sky label. When the fiddler Tommy Jackson was going to record an album for Dot Records, the Dixie Gentlemen were offered to back him up. In the early 1960s, they recorded for the small Time label. Shortly they signed with United Artists Records. The Dixie Gentlemen disbanded in 1966 after having made their last album together with fiddler Vassar Clements and dobro player Tut Taylor. Later, Yarbrough and Sizemore formed The Dixiemen. The original Dixie Gentlemen were temporarily revived in 1972 and again in the early 1990s.

About Dr. Julia Davis Born in 1891, Davis graduated from Dumas Elementary, Sumner High and Normal Schools and Stowe Teacher College. She received an M.A. in Education from the State University of Iowa and continued graduate study at Lincoln, Boston, Northwestern, St Louis, Syracuse and New York Universities. From 1913 until her retirement in 1961, she taught in the St. Louis Public Schools. Thirty-five of those years were spent at Simmons Elementary. Among her lifelong interests, Davis pursued research in African-American history. She served actively at Central Baptist church and in national, state, and local Baptist educational programs with the Metropolitan Church Federation. She also served with other civic and cultural groups. In an effort to raise public awareness of the contributions of African-Americans to American culture, Davis initiated, in 1941, a series of annual exhibits at the St. Louis Public Library. She also published many notable works on African- American history, including a calendar of African-American achievements and a compilation of biographical notes on twenty African-Americans for whom St Louis schools were named. On November 20, 1961, the day of her retirement from teaching, she established the Julia Davis Fund at the St Louis Public Library. The fund was designed for the purchase of books, manuscripts and other materials related to the African-American contribution to world culture. Thus was initiated the Julia Davis Research Collection on African-American History and Culture. It has grown into a major research collection on the subject. The collection is public and serves a lasting tribute to African-American cultural contributions. She was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Missouri-St. Louis in 1981 and celebrated her 100th birthday in November 1991 with a ceremony at Central Library. She died on April 26, 1993. About the Julia Davis Library On April 21, 1974, the St Louis Public Library broke with tradition by dedicating a Branch in honor of a living person. On February 14, 1993, the new Julia Davis Branch was officially opened. Built on a land donated by the Commerce Bank, it houses the collection consisting of books, manuscripts, newspapers, art work and other research materials, which document the history and cultural heritage of African Americans and people of African descent worldwide. Davis' initial gift of $2,500 in 1961 was used to begin the Library's Julia Davis Collection of Negro and African Literature and Culture. She also donated her personal collection to the Davis Collection at the same time. The ground breaking for a new Julia Davis Branch at 4415 Natural Bridge was held on September 29, 1991. Land for the new Branch, the first Branch of the St. Louis Public Library system to be constructed since 1974, had been donated by Commerce Bank of St. Louis. The building, designed by architect Russell Lewis of By Design, Inc., features a 100-seat auditorium and space for collections of 50,000 volumes. Computers and educational and recreational software packages are available for public use. The Julia Davis Research Collection, now housed at Central Library, was moved to the new Branch when it opened in late 1992 or early 1993.

The jury failed to reach a verdict, and a new trial was blocked on the grounds that Brown was too senile to be tried again. Brown's arrest attracted wide publicity, leading to a witness to the abduction of two children from Adelaide oval in 1973 identifying Brown as the man she had seen. Brown is thus considered a prime suspect for the Beaumont children disappearance and the Adelaide Oval disappearances.  Life  Arthur Brown was born in Merinda, Queensland, on 20 May 1912 and moved to Townsville with his parents when he was four. Following the separation of his parents, he moved to Melbourne, Victoria, with his mother, where he remained until he got a drivers licence when he moved back to Townsville and obtained work as a meatpacker. He was exempted from military service in World War II as his job was listed as a Reserved occupation, and in 1946 he became a maintenance carpenter with the Queensland Department of Public Works, where he was known to his workmates as a polite, immaculately dressed man who ironed knife-edge creases in his work uniforms. He was nicknamed The Scarlet Pimpernel based on the verse from the playSir Percy Blakeney: \\"We seek him here, we seek him there, Those Frenchies seek him everywhere. Is he in heaven? ‚Äì Is he in hell? That dammed, elusive Pimpernel\\". as he could be anywhere at any time due to flexible work hours and self-supervision. In 1944 Brown married Hester Porter (N√©e Andersen) following her divorce and became a stepfather to her three children. According to Hester's older sister Milly, Hester later told her that she was afraid of Brown and that she had caught him molesting a child and was trying to prevent him from being alone with children. Hester once gave a female relative the \\"prized\\" lacework she'd inherited from her mother, saying that she didn't want \\"his next lady love to get it\\". When asked whom she meant, Hester had replied \\"Charlotte, of course\\". On 15 May 1978 Hester, by now bedridden with arthritis, died after hitting her head in a fall, and Hester's younger sister Charlotte, who had five children, moved in with Brown. The couple married later that year. Some members of Hester's family believed Brown had killed Hester. One relative recalled that Brown wasn't grieving the day Hester died but was \\"shaking with fright\\" and looked worried. Brown told family members that he had paid for a post-mortem that found the death to be an accident, but investigating police found this to be untrue and believe the family doctor had written out a death certificate without examining the body, which Brown had had cremated. In 1982 another of Hester's sisters told her parents that Brown had molested her while a small girl. After this, many more of the Anderson extended family came forward to say they also had been molested. Following legal advice that taking the matter to court could be traumatic for the victims, the incidents were to be kept a family secret. It was not entirely secret, however, as an entry in Christine Millier's diary dated 23 January 1991 and produced at his trial in 1999 reads: \\"Kids and I went for walk to Strand. Arthur Brown drove by and the kids called him \\"rock spider\\", shouting it out. Eventually they told me what a rock spider was\\".\\"Rock Spider\\" is an Australian slang term for a child molester. The term is considered so serious that it is never used in jest.  Mackay sisters  Five-year-old Susan and seven-year-old Judith MacKay disappeared on the morning of Wednesday, 26 August 1970 from a school bus stop from their home in the Townsville suburb of Aitkenvale less than 10 minutes after leaving home. A search for the missing girls was mounted after they failed to return home after school and continued until the girls' bodies were found on Friday in the dry bed of Antill Creek, south-west of Townsville. Susan was found first and a trail of footprints from her body led searchers to where Judith's body lay. It was speculated that Judith had fled while Susan was being killed and had then been run down. A post-mortem revealed that Susan had been raped, strangled and stabbed three times in the chest, possibly after death. Judith had also been raped and stabbed three times in the chest but cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation by sand. Their school uniforms, straw hats and shoes were beside them, with each shoe containing a neatly folded sock while their uniforms were folded neatly inside their schoolbags.Tiny footprints led to schoolgirls' corpses beaumontchildren.com scan from The Australian 19 October 1999 The community was outraged, with one policeman stating that he wouldn't go home until they caught the killer. The officer slept at the Townsville police station while his wife brought him food and clean clothing. He died of a heart attack two weeks later. Police initially declined to post a reward but after interviewing more than 6,000 men who lived in the area and having no progress in the investigation, posted a reward of $10,000 (2011: $101,500) with an offer of a pardon for any accomplice who came forward.Brendan OMalley Queensland's Mackay sister murder shocked the nation The Courier-Mail 26 August 2009 One witness saw the girls talking to a man in a car at the bus stop at 8:10am. Just after 11am a car pulled into a service station at Ayr, south of Townsville and the driver bought $3 (around 25-litre/ 5 gll) of petrol. The two girls were in the car and the station attendant, Jean Thwaite, recalled the younger girl saying \\"Are we there yet?\\" followed by the older girl asking the driver, \\"When are you taking us to mummy? You promised to take us to mummy.\\" Not long after, Neil Lunney, a soldier recently returned from Vietnam, spoke to a driver who had cut him off. Lunney stated that he saw two girls in Aitkenvale school uniforms in the vehicle and that the driver appeared to be trying to avoid being seen. The evidence given by the station attendant and Lunney were both rejected as unreliable as, in contrast to all the other witnesses who identified the car as \\"looking like a Holden\\", they had both identified the car as a Vauxhall and neither were questioned \\"in depth\\". Several witnesses reported the girls being driven around in a car. Two witnesses later reported seeing a man walking towards a car from the direction of the murder scene around 1pm that day. Identification of the vehicle and suspect Two witnesses claimed the vehicle was a blue Vauxhall Victor, a very uncommon car at the time. Several witnesses described the vehicle as blue in colour and \\"looking like\\" a Holden EH. The media reported that the vehicle was a Holden FJ Several witnesses claimed the car looked like a Holden EH. Two witnesses said it was a blue Vauxhall Victor, a very uncommon car at the time. A car seen parked near the murder scene was described as an earlier model Holden (possibly a Holden FJ). Despite the various descriptions of the vehicle, the two witnesses who saw the children inside the car gave matching descriptions of the driver; with him having high cheekbones, narrow skull, short dark hair and, as one put it, \\"Mickey Mouse ears\\", and both were in agreement that the vehicle had a driver's door that was a different colour from the rest of the vehicle. One of these was to eventually be a key witness at the trial as he identified Brown as the driver with two young passengers that he had argued with over erratic driving that day. Although 28 years had passed, Brown's appearance had barely changed and he was still very much recognisable as the same person when compared to photographs of him taken in the 1970s. This would be an important factor in identifying him as matching the sketch of the suspect in the Beaumont and Adelaide Oval abductions. Inexplicably, the two witnesses who said the vehicle was a Vauxhall, later changed their minds and signed statements that the vehicle may have been an FJ Holden. The Police, believing the car seen parked near the murder scene was the offender's, concentrated on finding the vehicle rather than the driver, no sketch or photofit picture of the suspect was ever released and, despite evidence from the witness who refueled the car that the petrol cap was on the left side which ruled out the vehicle being a Holden, the media only ran pictures of FJ Holdens. Police were unable to locate the car at the time and the murders remained unsolved. Arthur Brown, who matched the suspects description and owned a blue Vauxhall Victor with an odd coloured drivers door, was never a suspect in the original police investigation. The evidence given by the two witnesses who identified the car as a Vauxhall was rejected as unreliable solely due to the belief held by police that the car was a Holden. They were never questioned in depth which police later admitted hindered investigations as both were the only witnesses to speak to the suspect while the girls were in the car.Greg Roberts Years Fail To Heal A School In Trauma Sydney Morning Herald 12 December 1998 The Mackay family moved to Toowoomba several months after the murders.  Suspect for Mackay murders  In 1998, a cousin of Brown's wife who was now living in Perth, Western Australia, who had been one of Brown's victims and also had suspicions about his involvement with the MacKay sisters, decided to phone Crimestoppers after they aired a program on the case. Sergeant David Hickey of the Queensland homicide squad, who was conducting the cold case review of the MacKay murders, returned the call three days later. The ensuing months of investigations by Detectives David Hickey and Brendan Rook, including interviewing other family members resulted in 45 cases against Brown relating to pedophilia and circumstantial evidence linking him to the MacKay murders. Investigations continued and evidence accumulated. Brown, who had been working as a carpenter at the MacKay sisters' school at the time, had been obsessed by the case, falsely claiming he knew the girls' father and two weeks after the murders he had offered to take two of his wife's cousins to view the murder site. He had replaced the odd-coloured door from his blue Vauxhall Victor, buried it, then later dug it up and took it to the rubbish tip explaining to his family he did it because he didn't want anyone interviewing or annoying him. Many of his victims were taken to Antill Creek to be molested and one instance was only from where the girls' bodies were found. Brown had twice previously confessed to the murders. In September 1970, Brown was drinking with 19-year-old John White in the White Horse Tavern in Charters Towers. White, who did not know Brown, claimed that Brown had asked if he had been following the murder of the Mackay sisters a few days earlier and had then stated that police were looking for the wrong car and that he had committed the murders. White reported the conversation to the local police who had dismissed the claim after speaking to \\"Arty Brown\\". In 1975, Brown confessed to the murders to his apprentice John Hill who said he never came forward before because it seemed totally out of character and he thought Brown was joking.Andrew Rule Did Arthur Brown Kill All These Girls eimeo scan of The Sun-Herald 8 July 2001 Brown was arrested on 45 charges of sexual assault and the rape of six children three to ten years of age and for the murders of Susan and Judith MacKay.  Trial and aftermath  The trial of Arthur Stanley Brown for the murders of Judith and Susan Mackay began on 18 October 1999. Although evidence regarding Brown's pedophilia had been given at the committal hearing it had been ruled prejudicial at trial and therefore could not be put before the Supreme Court jury. The jury were unable to reach a decision on the strong but circumstantial evidence. Trial was set for 25 July 2000 where the defense argued Brown was unfit to plead and a new trial was set for 31 July but before it could start newspapers reported that \\"the case did not proceed for legal reasons which cannot be published\\". The court suppressed release of the legal reasons until July 2001. In 2001 it was revealed that Brown's lawyer had applied for a section 613 verdict (unfit to be tried) from the jury. The jury had rejected the application, but in the meantime Brown's wife Charlotte had referred the case to the Queensland Mental Health Tribunal who ruled that Brown had progressive dementia and was also suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and was thus unfit to stand trial. The Attorney-General lodged an appeal and the court concluded that the Mental Health Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to overrule the jury and commissioned an independent psychiatric report. In July 2001 the report concluded that Brown was unfit to stand trial because he was suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Although the psychiatric report could not overrule the courts finding that the trial could proceed, Queensland's Director of Public Prosecutions, Leanne Clare, announced on 3 July that her office had decided not to proceed with the retrial and all charges against Brown were dropped. Death His wife of 24 years Charlotte Brown (formerly Anderson) died in April 2002. Ostracized by his family, Arthur Brown moved into a nursing home in Malanda, north Queensland where he died three months later on 6 July, officially an innocent man. Brown left instructions that no funeral notices be placed and only one stepdaughter had knowledge of the funeral details. His death was not reported until several weeks after the funeral. Stepson Robert stated \\"I can't believe such an insignificant little arsehole had such a profound effect on so many people's lives.\\" Everybody involved with the MacKay case is satisfied that Brown committed the murders and police have closed the file. The Beaumont children Along with Bevan Spencer von Einem, he is considered to be the best suspect for the Beaumont children disappearance as he bore a similarity to an identikit picture of the suspect for both the Beaumont children and Adelaide Oval cases. Brown is also a suspect in several other child murders and disappearances. A search for a connection to the Beaumonts was unsuccessful as no employment records existed that could shed light on his work history such as showing holidays when he may have travelled interstate. Some of the records were believed lost in the 1974 Brisbane flood and it is also possible that Brown, who had unrestricted access to government buildings, may have deleted his own employment files. Brown is considered a suspect for the Beaumont children disappearance, based on the connections that have been made between him and the Adelaide Oval Abduction. Although there is no proof that he had ever visited Adelaide, a witness recalled having a conversation with Brown in which he mentioned having seen the Adelaide Festival Centre nearing completion which places him in Adelaide after June 1973. The oval abduction occurred on 25 August 1973. Another witness who earlier had reported seeing a manThe suspect wore a distinctive wide-brimmed hat with a low, flat crown. Rare in Adelaide, the hat was common in the north of Australia. near the oval carrying a young girl while another older girl in obvious distress followed, identified Brown as the man she had seen after seeing his picture on television in December 1998 in relation to his arrest for the MacKay murders. She had reported that the man was wearing a pair of horn rimmed glasses which had fallen to the ground, been picked up and placed in a pocket. Brown is known to have worn horn rimmed reading glasses which police consider a significant point in the identification. This identification though is based on that of a woman who was aged 14 when she saw him, only for one minute, and who then saw a picture of Brown, now aged 86, 25 years later, albeit Brown at 86 compared to a photo of him taken in the 1970s showed little change in his appearance. Potential links to other cases *Fourteen-year-old Marilyn Joy Wallman disappeared while on the way to school at Eimeo Queensland, on 21 March 1972. Witnesses saw a blue Vauxhall in the area around the time of the disappearance. Brown and his wife Hester had visited relatives in Mackay (13 km from Eimeo) but his car (a blue Vauxhall) had broken down and the couple returned home by train. Brown returned to Mackay alone to pick up the car and police speculate that if the couple had taken an early train, Brown could have been passing Eimeo at the time that Wallman disappeared.Arthur Stanley Brown beaumontchildren.com In 1974 fragment of skull was discovered 40 kilometres away from where Wallman went missing and was positively identified as being Wallman's through DNA analysis in January 2015.http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/marilyn-wallman-farewelled- at-mackay-funeral/story- fnn8dlfs-1227251430209http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-06/marilyn-wallman- funeral-held-in-mackay/6286400http://www.news.com.au/national/marilyn-wallman- memorial-missing-mackay-girl-farewelled/story-fncynjr2-1227251441426 *Eighteen-year-old Catherine Pamela Graham was murdered in Oak Valley, 18 kilometres south of Townsville on 28 July 1975. Graham had been selling books door-to-door on the day she was murdered and had been seen door-knocking close to Brown's house. Her body was discovered only 500 metres from where the bodies of the Mackay sisters had been found in 1970. Police have evidence that two men were involved in the murder but admit that the disposal of Graham's body was very similar to that of the Mackay sisters and that there are other similarities which have not been released to the public.

Both Biggs and his brother Selwyn played international rugby for Wales, though they never played together in the same match for Wales. Biggs also played cricket for Glamorgan and in 1893 was part of a team that took on Cardiff in a two-day match; he faced his brother Selwyn, who was a member of the Cardiff team. Biggs is notable for being a member of the 1893 Triple Crown winning Wales team, being the youngest capped player to represent the Wales international team, a record he held for over a century, and the unusual circumstances of his death by poison arrow. Early history Norman Biggs was born in Cardiff to John and Emily Biggs. His father, who lived at Park Place in the centre of the city, was a brewer by trade who owned businesses in Cardiff and Bristol. Biggs was privately educated at several proprietary schools including Lewinsdale School in Weston- super-Mare, before matriculating to University College Cardiff and later Trinity Hall, Cambridge, playing rugby for both university teams.Jenkins (1991), p. 21 It was reported that Biggs should have won a sporting 'Blue' while at Cambridge, but an injury to his ribs ruled him out. As well as playing rugby, Biggs was a keen sprinter and he was able to run 100 yards in even time, and was able to beat world sprint champion Charlton Monypenny at this distance. On returning to Cardiff he joined his father's brewing business. In 1887, Biggs played his first senior game for Cardiff RFC, in a match against Penarth. Biggs came from a large sporting family and was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff. His most notable brothers were Selwyn, who also played for Wales, and Cecil, who captained Cardiff during their 1904/05 season. Rugby career International debut Biggs gained his first cap for Wales when he was selected to play against the touring New Zealand Natives in 1888 at St. Helen's Ground. At the time Biggs was 18 years and 49 days old, making him the youngest Wales international, a record that would last for more than a century before being broken by Tom Prydie in 2010.Griffiths (1987), p. 4:5. The New Zealanders were the first touring team from the Southern Hemisphere and brought with them a reputation for over- vigorous play. Biggs himself was described by the press as \\"palpably nervous\\" before the kick-off, though many of the backs appeared withdrawn, apart from William Stadden and James Webb appearing calm.Billot (1972), p.17 Not only did Biggs have the MƒÅori opposition to contend with, the Swansea crowd were also hostile towards their own team, as they felt the Swansea backs should have been selected instead. Biggs, as an inexperienced new cap from rivals Cardiff, was picked out by the crowd as one of those players unworthy of his place and was heckled. Nonetheless, the Welsh team were victorious, with tries from Thomas, Towers and Hannan and a single conversion from Webb. A week later on 29 December, Biggs faced the same tourists, this time as part of the Cardiff team. Biggs had been disappointing in his international debut, but regained his form on the pitch at the Cardiff Arms Park.Billot (1972), p 21 Within 90 seconds of the start of the match, Biggs scored a \\"sparkling try\\". Biggs should have scored again, but dropped the ball after crossing the line in the slippery conditions. Cardiff won by a goal and a try to one try. Home Nations Championship matches Later in the 1888‚Äì89 season, Biggs was reselected for the Welsh team as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. He was not chosen for the first game of the season against Scotland, but was accepted for the second and final game to Ireland. Under the captaincy of Arthur Gould, Biggs was partnered on the wing by Abel Davies of London Welsh. Wales lost to Ireland by two tries to nil, the first time the Irish had won on Welsh soil.Griffiths (1987), p. 3:3 ‚Äì 3:6. Biggs and Davies were both dropped for the next season. It took Biggs until the 1892 Home Nations Championship to regain his place in the national team, again he was chosen for the final game of the tournament against Ireland. Although the Welsh backs contained the talents of Billy Bancroft, brothers Evan and David James and Arthur and Bert Gould, the Welsh team were outclassed by Victor Le Fanu's Ireland. It was the first time Wales had lost all three games in the Championship. Despite the loss Biggs was reselected for all three games of the 1893 tournament, all under the captaincy of \\"Monkey\\" Gould. In a reversal of fortunes from the previous season, Wales managed to win all three matches, lifting the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. Biggs played an important role during the Triple Crown winning season, scoring two tries, one each in the games against England and Scotland. The 1893 away game against Scotland is described as Biggs' best international match and 'his speed and general play were the main factors in securing the first victory of the Principality over Scotland at Scotland'. Biggs played in two more internationals for Wales, both in the 1894 Championship and both resulted in losses. The first game of the 1894 Championship was against England, and Wales suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24‚Äì3. In an after match interview Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle Harry Bradshaw, who scored the first try; Biggs responded \\"Tackle him? It was as much as I could do to get out of his way!\\". In his final game against Ireland, Biggs was part of an all Cardiff three-quarters, along with Tom Pearson, Dai Fitzgerald and Jack Elliott. The very next international saw Biggs' younger brother Selwyn selected for the first time, the brothers missing each other by just one match. International matches played WalesSmith (1980), p. 463 * 1893, 1894 * 1889, 1892, 1893, 1894 * 1888 * 1893 Club and county Biggs played for Cardiff from the 1886‚Äì87 season through to 1898‚Äì99, though not continuously, spending some time in the early 1890s in London.Davies (1975) p. 213 He played in 166 matches for Cardiff, was one of the highest scoring players the club had produced. He scored five or more try conversions in a single match on seven occasions, six in the same season (1893‚Äì94), against Gloucester, Bristol, London Welsh, Penygraig, Exeter and Cardiff & D.R.U.Davies (1975) p. 419 The 1893‚Äì94 season saw Biggs score 58 conversions, 25 tries and two dropped goals bringing his points tally to 199 points.Davies (1975) p. 427 This remained a club record until the 1972‚Äì73 season when it was surpassed by John Davies. Biggs ended his Cardiff career with 107 tries, four less than his brother Cecil.Davies (1975) p. 413 Biggs played for several club teams throughout his career, including England's Richmond and Welsh exile club London Welsh. On 24 December 1890, Biggs played for London Welsh in a match against his longterm club Cardiff. The London Welsh team produced a 'devastating display' to beat Cardiff by a single try.Davis (1975) p.307 At county level he represented Glamorgan where he played alongside his brother, and later turned out for Somerset. During the 1893/94 season Biggs was made club captain of Cardiff, and in the same season he led Cardiff against the invitational team the Barbarians, not only winning the game but also scoring two tries and kicking a successful conversion. The same season as he faced the Barbarians with Cardiff, Biggs was invited to join the tourists; one of four of the Biggs brothers to play for the team. The last notable club Biggs represented was Bath, captaining the senior team during the 1899‚Äì1900 season. In 1894 Biggs was invited to play for the Barbarians, and on 2 April, he faced Rockcliff, playing alongside his brother Selwyn, who was also making his Barbarian's debut. Biggs played twice more for the Barbarians, both matches against Bath Rugby. In the 1894 encounter Biggs converted a try in a 14-0 victory, while the 1896 match saw Biggs score a try and two conversions in a 13-13 draw.Starmer-Smith (1977), p.234 Later life and military career After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Biggs volunteered for active service and was posted as a private to the Glamorgan Yeomanry, which formed 4 Company, 1st Battalion Imperial Yeomanry for service in South Africa. Biggs later reflected how life in the Yeomanry was a constant struggle, and he engaged in 57 skirmishes with his unit coming under daily sniper fire. He was wounded near Vrede on 11 October 1900, when he was shot through the thigh whilst patrolling. He was returned to England on the hospital ship Simla which left Cape Town 26 November and arrived at Southampton on 18 December. He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant on 16 February 1901. On 17 April he was promoted lieutenant and attached to 4th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry. Later in the year he either received a further wound, or fell ill, since The Times reported on 26 September that he had been discharged from hospital and returned to duty in the week ending 8 September. He returned home on the steamship Goorkha, which left Cape Town on 19 July. He relinquished his commission on 12 September, and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant, and permission to continue wearing his uniform. Biggs was then commissioned as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion Welsh Regiment on 13 June 1903. He was appointed an Instructor of Musketry on 10 May 1905, He was then seconded to the Colonial Office and posted to Northern Nigeria as a superintendent of police in a military area on 10 February 1906, by that time he had also been promoted captain. He was killed in 1908 when he was struck by a poison arrow, while on patrol in Kebbi State, Nigeria.

The currently accepted scientific hypothesis is that the Earth was formed by accretion of material with a chondritic composition. Still during the accretionary phase planetary differentiation started, giving rise to the Earth's core, where heavy metallic siderophile elements accumulated. Around it was an (in this stage) undifferentiated mantle, the primitive mantle. Further differentiation would take place later, creating the different chemical reservoirs of crust and mantle, with incompatible elements accumulating in the crust.

The last name is confusing but derives from the fact that such reservoirs are comparable in composition to the primitive mantle. Volcanic rocks from hotspot areas often have a primitive composition.

History The President Ramon Magsaysay State University, a merger of three public education institutions in the province of Zambales, was established by virtue of Republic Act 8498, enacted on February 12, 1998 through the initiative of Congressman Antonio M. Diaz. The University Charter integrated the former Ramon Magsaysay Polytechnic College (RMPC) in Iba, the former Western Luzon Agricultural College (WLAC) in San Marcelino, and the former Candelaria School of Fisheries (CSF) in Candelaria. The strengths of its parent-institutions, which had existed since the early 1900s, served as PRMSU's springboard for its accelerated growth and development.RMTU at a Glance, About Us. The RMPC in 1998, which is now PRMSU‚Äôs Main Campus, was founded as a farm school in 1910. It was converted into a provincial trade school in 1919. Through the years, it metamorphosed into Zambales Trade School in 1933, Western Luzon School of Arts and Trades in 1953, Zambales School of Arts and Trades in 1957, and Ramon Magsaysay Memorial School of Arts and Trades in 1961. It became a DECS- supervised College (RMPC) in 1993 and a chartered state college in 1995.RMTU at a Glance, About Us. WLAC, now the San Marcelino Campus, started as a farm school in 1927. It became the Zambales Rural High School in 1933, the Zambales National Agricultural School in 1960, the Western Luzon Junior Agricultural College in 1977, and eventually evolved into a full-fledged state college in 1985.

Established in 1965, CSF started as a secondary vocational high school and eventually offered post-secondary, non- degree courses under the supervision of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Philippines) (TESDA).RMTU at a Glance, About Us. Dr. Feliciano S. Rosete assumed office as the first duly elected and appointed President of the University effective February 12, 2001, the start of the full operation of the institution as a multi-campus university system. With a viable organizational structure, the institution transformed dramatically as it accelerated the full integration of its component campuses. Through strong partnership with the Provincial Government, DepEd and municipal governments, PRMSU had established LGU-subsidized satellite campuses in Masinloc, Castillejos, and Sta. Cruz in the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Faculty development and infrastructure build-up were intensified. Degree programs increased from 12 to 65 in the last nine (9) years. Enrolment expanded from 2,000 to 8,000 per semester over the same period. Massive scholarships from various stakeholders attracted more and more students. Graduates registered commendable performance in licensure examinations especially in electrical, mechanical and civil engineering and other flagship programs. In addition to its Php 93.0M annual budget from the National Government, income from revenue-generating projects and self-liquidating academic programs reached as high as Php 80.0M per year. Major curricular programs attained various accreditation levels and PRMSU achieved an unprecedented Level III-A status under the Commission on Higher Education- Department of Budget and Management-Philippine Association of State Colleges and Universities (CHED-DBM-PASUC) Leveling Scheme. The CHED also listed PRMSU as one of the top 30 higher education institutions (HEIs) recognized by the People‚Äôs Republic of China, South Korea and other countries.RMTU at a Glance, About Us.

Life  Son of a village clogmaker, Charles-Louis Philippe rose from his modest background first to secondary education via a grant, then to the world of letters. However, he remained attached to the class of his birth. He wrote to the bourgeois writer and politician Maurice Barr√®s... Philippe passed the Baccalaureat in science in 1891, but failed in his attempts to enter the specialist colleges in Paris (√âcole polytechnique, √âcole centrale). He eventually obtained a modest office job in the administration of Paris, which allowed him to settle in the capital and pursue his vocation as a writer. Among his literary friends and admirers would be Paul Claudel, L√©on-Paul Fargue, Andr√© Gide, Jean Giraudoux, Francis Jammes, Valery Larbaud.  Works  After a short period writing poetry, he turned to fiction, publishing a collection of overheated tales of ‚Äúpoor love‚Äù (Quatre histoires de pauvre amour, 1897), then two sentimental portraits of village girls (La bonne Madeleine et la pauvre Marie, 1898), and a lyrical evocation of his own childhood and youth (La M√®re et l‚Äôenfant, 1900). A brief liaison with a prostitute inspired his best-known novel, Bubu de Montparnasse (1901), which earned him critical as well as popular attention. A provincial novel followed: Le P√®re Perdrix (1902) recounts the painful old age of a blacksmith, and explores the small-town class system. Marie Donadieu (1904) returns to Paris to tell a passionate love story tinged with individualism inspired by Nietzsche. Croquignole (1906) evokes the stifling office atmosphere Philippe knew well, and which his hero escapes, but briefly, through an inheritance. Despite some strong support (notably from Octave Mirbeau), the last three novels failed to win the new Prix Goncourt. He turned next to a fictionalised life of his father (Charles Blanchard), but abandoned what was to be a kind of hymn to work shortly before his sudden death, from meningitis, in December 1909. In his last years he had also written 50 entertaining short stories for a large-circulation Paris paper, Le Matin, which were published in volume form after his death (Dans la petite ville, 1910, Les Contes du Matin, 1916). Thanks to the efforts of Gide, other occasional writings and two volumes of letters were published between 1911 and 1928 : Lettres de jeunesse (1911), Chroniques du Canard sauvage (1923), Lettres √† sa m√®re (1928). L'Association internationale des Amis de Charles- Louis Philippe has existed since 1935 to promote knowledge of his life and work through an annual bulletin.Secretary: d.roe@leeds.ac.uk.

The Han dynasty (206 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE) of ancient China, divided between the eras of Western Han (206 BCE ‚Äì 9 CE, when the capital was at Chang'an), Xin dynasty of Wang Mang (r. 9‚Äì23 CE), and Eastern Han (25‚Äì220 CE, when the capital was at Luoyang, and after 196 CE at Xuchang), witnessed some of the most significant advancements in premodern Chinese science and technology. There were great innovations in metallurgy. In addition to Zhou-era China's (c. 1050 ‚Äì 256 BCE) previous inventions of the blast furnace and cupola furnace to make pig iron and cast iron, respectively, the Han period saw the development of steel and wrought iron by use of the finery forge and puddling process. With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine up to the surface to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted pipeline transport systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel- powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron seed drill were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical chain pump powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating trip hammers in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere around the Earth. The quality of life was improved with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century CE had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed for better navigation of their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with the invention of the seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today. Modern perspectives on science and technology during Han wine-heating stove made of bronze, dated to the Western Han Jin Guantao, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Fan Hongye, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Science Policy and Managerial Science, and Liu Qingfeng, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, assert that the latter part of the Han dynasty was a unique period in the history of premodern Chinese science and technology.Jin, Fan, & Liu (1996), 178‚Äì179. They compare it to the incredible pace of scientific and technological growth during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279). However, they also argue that without the influence of proto-scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of Mohism, Chinese science continued to lack a definitive structure: > From the middle and late Eastern Han to the early Wei and Jin dynasties, the > net growth of ancient Chinese science and technology experienced a peak > (second only to that of the Northern Song dynasty) ...Han studies of the > Confucian classics, which for a long time had hindered the socialization of > science, were declining. If Mohism, rich in scientific thought, had rapidly > grown and strengthened, the situation might have been very favorable to the > development of a scientific structure. However, this did not happen because > the seeds of the primitive structure of science were never formed. During > the late Eastern Han, disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of > social transformation, leading to the greatest social disorder in Chinese > history. One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science. Joseph Needham (1900‚Äì1995), a late Professor from the University of Cambridge and author of the groundbreaking Science and Civilisation in China series, stated that the \\"Han time (especially the Later Han) was one of the relatively important periods as regards the history of science in China.\\"Needham (1972), 111. He noted the advancements during Han of astronomy and calendrical sciences, the \\"beginnings of systematic botany and zoology\\", as well as the philosophical skepticism and rationalist thought embodied in Han works such as the Lunheng by the philosopher Wang Chong (27‚Äì100 CE). Writing materials Sunzi's (fl. 6th century BCE) The Art of War, a Qing dynasty copy from the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736‚Äì1795) The most common writing mediums found in archaeological digs from ancient sites predating the Han period are shells and bones as well as bronzewares.Loewe (1968), 89. In the beginning of the Han period, the chief writing mediums were bamboo () and clay tablets, silk cloth, strips of soft wood, and rolled scrolls made of strips of bamboo sewn together with hempen string passed through drilled holes (ÂÜå) and secured with clay stamps.Tom (1989), 99; Cotterell (2004), 11‚Äì13; Loewe (1968), 94‚Äì95. The written characters on these narrow flat strips of bamboo were arranged into vertical columns.Loewe (1968), 92‚Äì93. While maps drawn in ink on flat silk cloths have been found in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, Hunan province), the earliest known paper map found in China, dated 179‚Äì141 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper.Buisseret (1998), 12. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper.Needham (1986e), 1‚Äì2, 40‚Äì41, 122‚Äì123, 228. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50‚Äì121 CE) created a process in 105 where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper.Tom (1989), 99; Day & McNeil (1996), 122; Needham (1986e), 1‚Äì2, 40‚Äì41, 122‚Äì123, 228. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely to 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack.Cotterell (2004), 11. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.Needham (1986e), 1‚Äì2. Ceramics The Han ceramics industry was upheld by private businesses as well as local government agencies.Wang (1982), 146‚Äì147. Ceramics were used in domestic wares and utensils as well as construction materials for roof tiles and bricks.Wang (1982), 147‚Äì149. Han dynasty grey pottery‚Äîits color derived from the clay that was used‚Äîwas superior to earlier Chinese grey pottery due to the Han people's use of larger kiln chambers, longer firing tunnels, and improved chimney designs.Wang (1982), 142‚Äì143. Kilns of the Han dynasty making grey pottery were able to reach firing temperatures above . However, hard southern Chinese pottery made from a dense adhesive clay native only in the south (i.e. Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and southern Jiangsu) was fired at even higher temperatures than grey pottery during the Han. Glazed pottery of the Shang (c. 1600 ‚Äì c. 1050 BCE) and Zhou (c. 1050 ‚Äì 256 BCE) dynasties were fired at high temperatures, but by the mid Western Han (206 BCE ‚Äì 9 CE), a brown-glazed ceramic was made which was fired at the low temperature of , followed by a green-glazed ceramic which became popular in the Eastern Han (25‚Äì220 CE).Wang (1982), 143‚Äì145. Wang Zhongshu states that the light-green stoneware known as celadon was thought to exist only since the Three Kingdoms period (220‚Äì265 CE) onwards, but argues that ceramic shards found at Eastern Han (25‚Äì220 CE) sites of Zhejiang province can be classified as celadon.Wang (1982), 145. However, Richard Dewar argues that true celadon was not created in China until the early Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) when Chinese kilns were able to reach a minimum furnace temperature of , with a preferred range of for celadon.Dewar (2002), 42.

The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BCE during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141‚Äì87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelted elsewhere).Wagner (2001), 7, 36‚Äì37, 64‚Äì68; Pigott (1999), 183‚Äì184. Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron.Wagner (2001), 75‚Äì76. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached the bottom of the furnace. A Western-Han bronze tripod oil lamp, 1st century BCE An Eastern-Han pair of iron scissors A Han-dynasty iron plowshare Although Chinese civilization lacked the bloomery, the Han Chinese were able to make wrought iron when they injected too much oxygen into the cupola furnace, causing decarburization.Pigott (1999), 177 & 191. The Han-era Chinese were also able to convert cast iron and pig iron into wrought iron and steel by using the finery forge and puddling process, the earliest specimens of such dating to the 2nd century BCE and found at Tieshengguo near Mount Song of Henan province.Wang (1982), 125; Pigott (1999), 186. The semisubterranean walls of these furnaces were lined with refractory bricks and had bottoms made of refractory clay.Wang (1982), 125. Besides charcoal made of wood, Wang Zhongshu states that another furnace fuel used during the Han were \\"coal cakes\\", a mixture of coal powder, clay, and quartz.Wang (1982), 126. Use of steel, iron, and bronze Donald B. Wagner writes that most domestic iron tools and implements produced during the Han were made of cheaper and more brittle cast iron, whereas the military preferred to use wrought iron and steel weaponry due to their more durable qualities.Wagner (1993), 336. During the Han dynasty, the typical bronze sword found in the Warring States period was gradually replaced with an iron sword measuring roughly in length.Wang (1982), 122‚Äì123. The ancient dagger-axe (ge) made of bronze was still used by Han soldiers, although it was gradually phased out by iron spears and iron ji halberds.Wang (1982), 123. Even arrowheads, which were traditionally made of bronze, gradually only had a bronze tip and iron shaft, until the end of the Han when the entire arrowhead was made solely of iron. Farmers, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, stonemasons, and rammed earth builders had at their disposal iron tools such as the plowshare, pickaxe, spade, shovel, hoe, sickle, axe, adze, hammer, chisel, knife, saw, scratch awl, and nails.Wang (1982), 122. Common iron commodities found in Han dynasty homes included tripods, stoves, cooking pots, belt buckles, tweezers, fire tongs, scissors, kitchen knives, fish hooks, and needles. Mirrors and oil lamps were often made of either bronze or iron.Wang (1982), 103‚Äì105 & 124 Coin money minted during the Han was made of either copper or copper and tin smelted together to make the bronze alloy.Ebrey (1986), 611‚Äì612; Nishijima (1986), 586‚Äì587. Agriculture Tools and methods Modern archaeologists have unearthed Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Yunnan in the south.Wang (1982), 53. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen.Wang (1982), 54. Oxen were also used to pull the three- legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand.Greenberger (2006), 12; Cotterell (2004), 24; Wang (1982), 54‚Äì55. While artwork of the Wei (220‚Äì265 CE) and Jin (265‚Äì420) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25‚Äì220 CE).Wang (1982), 55. Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.Wang (1982), 55‚Äì56; Ebrey (1986), 617. Alternating fields During Emperor Wu's (r. 141‚Äì87 BCE) reign, the Grain Intendant Zhao Guo (Ë∂ôÈÅé) invented the alternating fields system (daitianfa ‰ª£Áî∞Ê≥ï).Nishijima (1986), 561. For every mou of land‚Äîi.e. a thin but elongated strip of land measuring wide and long, or an area of roughly Swann (1974), 361.‚Äîthree low-lying furrows (quan ÁîΩ) that were each wide were sowed in straight lines with crop seed. While weeding in the summer, the loose soil of the ridges (long Â£ü) on either side of the furrows would gradually fall into the furrows, covering the sprouting crops and protecting them from wind and drought. Since the position of the furrows and ridges were reversed by the next year, this process was called the alternating fields system. A Han- dynasty pottery model of a standing cow This system allowed crops to grow in straight lines from sowing to harvest, conserved moisture in the soil, and provided a stable annual yield for harvested crops.Nishijima (1986), 562. Zhao Guo first experimented with this system right outside the capital Chang'an, and once it proved successful, he sent out instructions for it to every commandery administrator, who were then responsible for disseminating these to the heads of every county, district, and hamlet in their commanderies. Sadao Nishijima speculates that the Imperial Counselor Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) perhaps had a role in promoting this new system.Nishijima (1986), 562‚Äì563. Rich families who owned oxen and large heavy moldboard iron plows greatly benefited from this new system. However, poorer farmers who did not own oxen resorted to using teams of men to move a single plow, which was exhausting work.Nishijima (1986), 563‚Äì564. The author Cui Shi (ÂÇ¨ÂØî) (d. 170 CE) wrote in his Simin yueling (ÂõõÊ∞ëÊúà‰ª§) that by the Eastern Han Era (25‚Äì220 CE) an improved plow was invented which needed only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it, had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil, and could sow roughly of land in a single day.Nishijima (1986), 563‚Äì564; Ebrey (1986), 616‚Äì617. Pit fields A Western-Han pottery model of a sitting bull During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33‚Äì37 BCE), Fan Shengzhi wrote a manual (i.e. the Fan Shengzhi shu) which described the pit field system (aotian ÂáπÁî∞).Nishijima (1986), 564‚Äì565.Hinsch (2002), 67‚Äì68. In this system, every mou of farmland was divided into 3,840 grids which each had a small pit that was dug deep and wide and had good quality manure mixed into the soil. Twenty seeds were sowed into each pit, which allegedly produced 0.6 L (20 oz) of harvested grain per pit, or roughly 2,000 L (67,630 oz) per mou. This system did not require oxen-driven plows or the most fertile land, since it could be employed even on sloping terrains where supplying water was difficult for other methods of farming.Nishijima (1986), 565; Hinsch (2002) 67‚Äì68. Although this farming method was favored by the poor, it did require intensive labor, thus only large families could maintain such a system.Nishijima (1986), 565‚Äì566; Hinsch (2002), 67‚Äì68. Rice paddies An Eastern-Han pottery model of a rice paddy field with farmers Han farmers in the Yangzi River region of southern China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time.Nishijima (1986), 568‚Äì569. In this system, the field lays fallow for much of the year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation.Nishijima (1986), 570‚Äì572. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery. Mechanical and hydraulic engineering Literary sources and archaeological evidence winnowing machine with a crank handle and a tilt hammer used to pound grain. Evidence of Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang Âå†) did not leave behind detailed records of their work.Needham (1986c), 2, 9; see also Barbieri-Low (2007), 36. Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.Needham (1986c), 2. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. As written by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the belt drive was first used for a quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the bobbins of weaver shuttles.Temple (1986), 54‚Äì55. The invention of the belt drive was a crucial first step in the development of later technologies during the Song dynasty, such as the chain drive and spinning wheel. The inventions of the artisan and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (‰∏ÅÁ∑©) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital.Barbieri-Low (2007), 197. The official and poet Sima Xiangru (179‚Äì117 BCE) once hinted in his writings that the Chinese used a censer in the form of a gimbal, a pivot support made of concentric rings which allow the central gimbal to rotate on an axis while remaining vertically positioned.Needham (1986c), 233‚Äì234. However, the first explicit mention of the gimbal used as an incense burner occurred around 180 CE when the artisan Ding Huan created his 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions' which allowed burning incense placed within the central gimbal to remain constantly level even when moved.Needham (1986c), 233‚Äì234; Barbieri-Low (2007), 198, writes that \\"For reasons I cannot determine, Joseph Needham estimated that Ding Huan was active around 180 CE, during the Latter Han period,\\" although on the previous page 197, Barbieri-Low writes of Ding Huan's biography in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital, \\"The avoidance of some tabooed written characters in his story suggest to me that Ding Huan's tale may have been written during the Latter Han period.\\" Ding had other inventions as well. For the purpose of indoor air conditioning, he set up a large manually operated rotary fan which had rotating wheels that were in diameter.Needham (1986c), 99, 134, 151, 233. He also invented a lamp which he called the 'nine-storied hill-censer', since it was shaped as a hillside.Temple (1986), 87; Needham (1986b), 123. When the cylindrical lamp was lit, the convection of rising hot air currents caused vanes placed on the top to spin, which in turn rotated painted paper figures of birds and other animals around the lamp. mold for making bronze gear wheels When Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202‚Äì195 BCE) came upon the treasury of Qin Shi Huang (r. 221‚Äì210) at Xianyang following the downfall of the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206), he found an entire miniature musical orchestra of puppets tall who played mouth organs if one pulled on ropes and blew into tubes to control them.Needham (1986c), 158. Zhang Heng wrote in the 2nd century CE that people could be entertained by theatrical plays of artificial fish and dragons. Later, the inventor Ma Jun (fl. 220‚Äì265) invented a theater of moving mechanical puppets powered by the rotation of a hidden waterwheel. From literary sources it is known that the collapsible umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple parasol existed beforehand. This employed sliding levers and bendable joints that could be protracted and retracted.Needham (1986c), 70‚Äì71. Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines.Needham (1986c), 116‚Äì119, 153‚Äì154 & Plate CLVI; Temple (1986), 46; Wang (1982), 57. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century.Needham (1986c), 283‚Äì285. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li).Needham (1986c), 281‚Äì285. From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.Temple (1986), 86‚Äì87; Loewe (1968), 195‚Äì196. Uses of the waterwheel and water clock hydraulic- powered chain pumps from an encyclopedia written in 1637 by Song Yingxing A stone sundial from the Eastern Han period, 2nd century AD, excavated from Togtoh, Inner Mongolia By the Han dynasty, the Chinese developed various uses for the waterwheel. An improvement of the simple lever-and-fulcrum tilt hammer device operated by one's foot, the hydraulic-powered trip hammer used for pounding, decorticating, and polishing grain was first mentioned in the Han dictionary Jijiupian of 40 BCE.Needham (1986c), 183‚Äì184, 390‚Äì392. It was also mentioned in the Regional Speech (Fangyan) dictionary written by Yang Xiong (53 BCE ‚Äì 18 CE) in 15 BCE, the philosophical Xinlun Êñ∞Ë´ñ written by Huan Tan (43 BCE ‚Äì 28 CE) in 20 CE, the poetry of Ma Rong (79‚Äì166 CE), and the writings of Kong Rong (153‚Äì208 CE). In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), the philosopher Wang Chong (27‚Äì100 CE) was the first in China to describe the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances).Needham (1986c), 89, 110, & 344. Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam.Needham (1986c), 342‚Äì346. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.Needham (1986c), 33 & 345. While acting as administrator of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked the bellows of the blast furnace and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work the bellows.de Crespigny (2007), 184; Needham (1986c), 370. Although the astronomical armillary sphere (representing the celestial sphere) had existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139 CE) provided it with motive power by using the constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted on a set of gears.Needham (1986c), 30 & 479 footnote e; de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Morton & Lewis (2005), 70; Bowman (2000), 595; Temple (1986), 37. Zhang Heng was also the first to address the problem of the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.Needham (1986c), 30 & 479 footnote e; de Crespigny (2007), 1050. Seismometer The Han court was responsible for the major efforts of disaster relief when natural disasters such as earthquakes devastated the lives of commoners.Ebrey (1986), 621. To better prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a seismometer in 132 CE, which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific cardinal or ordinal direction.de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Morton & Lewis (2005), 70. Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern Gansu).Minford & Lau (2002), 307; Balchin (2003), 26‚Äì27; Needham (1986a), 627; Needham (1986c), 484; Krebs (2003), 31. Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi ÂÄôÈ£éÂú∞Âä®‰ª™), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air.Needham (1986a), 626. A modern replica of Zhang Heng's seismometer of 132 As described in the Book of the Later Han, the frame of the seismometer was a domed bronze vessel in the shape of a wine jar, although it was in diameter and decorated with scenes of mountains and animals.Needham (1986a), 626‚Äì627; Barbieri-Low (2007), 203. The trigger mechanism was an inverted pendulum (which the Book of the Later Han calls the \\"central column\\") that, if disturbed by the ground tremors of earthquakes located near or far away, would swing and strike one of eight mobile arms (representing the eight directions), each with a crank and catch mechanism. The crank and a right angle lever would raise one of eight metal dragon heads located on the exterior, dislodging a metal ball from its mouth that dropped into the mouth of one of eight metal toads below arranged like the points on a compass rose, thus indicating the direction of the earthquake.Needham (1986a), 627‚Äì631. The Book of the Later Han states that when the ball fell into any one of eight toad mouths, it produced a loud noise which gained the attention of those observing the device.Needham (1986a), 626‚Äì627. While Wang Zhenduo (ÁéãÊåØÈìé) accepted the idea that Zhang's seismometer had cranks and levers which were disturbed by the inverted pendulum, his contemporary Akitsune Imamura (1870‚Äì1948) argued that the inverted pendulum could have had a pin at the top which, upon moving by force of the ground vibrations, would enter one of eight slots and expel the ball by pushing a slider.Needham (1986a), 631. Since the Book of the Later Han states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset. Mathematics and astronomy Mathematical treatises A page of the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art One of the earliest surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei.Liu et al. (2003), 9. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the zhoubi school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132‚Äì192 CE) commentary of 180.Cullen (2007), 138‚Äì149; Dauben (2007), 213‚Äì214. A preface was added to the text by Zhao Shuang Ë∂ôÁàΩ in the 3rd century.Dauben (2007), 214. There was also the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century) in 263.Needham (1986a), 24‚Äì25. It is worth noting in this context that many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence of the practical mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.Brian Lander. \\"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\\" T'oung Pao 100.4‚Äì5 (2014): 350‚Äì352. Innovations in the treatises The Suan shu shu presents basic mathematics problems and solutions. It was most likely a handbook for day-to-day business transactions or affairs of government administration.Dauben (2007), 213. It contains problems and solutions for field measurements of area, proportional exchange rates for agricultural millet and rice, distribution by proportion, short width division, and excess and deficiency.Dauben (2007), 212. Some of the problems found in the Suan shu shu appear in the later text Jiuzhang suanshu; in five cases, the titles are exact matches. However, unlike the Jiuzhang suanshu, the Suan shu shu does not deal with problems involving right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, which demonstrates the significant advancements made in Chinese mathematics between the writings of these two texts.Dauben (2007) 212; Liu, Feng, Jiang, & Zheng (2003), 9‚Äì10. Mathematical proof for the Pythagorean theorem (in Chinese: ÂãæËÇ°ÂÆöÁêÜ) as seen in the treatise Zhoubi Suanjing compiled during the Han dynasty The Zhoubi suanjing, written in dialogue form and with regularly presented problems, is concerned with the application of mathematics to astronomy. In one problem which sought to determine the height of the Sun from the Earth and the diameter of the Sun, Chen Zi (Èô≥Â≠ê) instructs Rong Fang (Ê¶ÆÊñπ) to wait until the shadow cast by the 8 chi tall gnomon is 6 chi (one chi during the Han was 33 cm), so that a 3-4-5 right-angle triangle can be constructed where the base is 60,000 li (one li during the Han was the equivalent of 415 m or 1362 ft), the hypotenuse leading towards the sun is 100,000 li, and the height of the sun is 80,000 li.Dauben (2007), 219. Like the Jiuzhang suanshu, the Zhoubi suanjing also gives mathematical proof for the \\"Gougu Theorem\\" (ÂãæËÇ°ÂÆöÁêÜ; i.e. where c is the length of the hypotenuse and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, respectively, a2 \\\\+ b2 = c2), which is known as the Pythagorean theorem in the West after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras (fl. 6th century BCE).Needham (1986a), 22; Dauben (2007), 221‚Äì222. The Jiuzhang suanshu was perhaps the most groundbreaking of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature negative numbers, along with the Bakhshali manuscript (200? ‚Äì 600? CE) of India and the book of the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE.Temple (1986), 141; Liu, Feng, Jiang, & Zheng (2003), 9‚Äì10. Negative numbers appeared as black counting rods, while positive numbers appeared as red counting rods.Temple (1986), 141. Although the decimal system existed in China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 ‚Äì c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a decimal fraction (i.e. the denominator is a power of ten) is an inscription on a standard volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (46 BCE ‚Äì 23 CE).Temple (1986), 139 & 142‚Äì143. Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the Jiuzhang suanshu, as a means to solve equations and represent measurements. Gaussian elimination, an algorithm used to solve linear equations, was known as the Array Rule in the Jiuzhang suanshu.Needham (1986a), 24‚Äì25, 121; Shen, Crossley, & Lun (1999), 388; Straffin (1998), 166. While the book used continued fractions to find the roots of equations, Liu Hui built on this idea in the 3rd century when he increased the decimals to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the Horner scheme named after William George Horner (1786‚Äì1837).Temple (1986), 142. Approximations of pi Yang Hui's (Pascal's) triangle, as depicted by Zhu Shijie in 1303, using counting rods For centuries, the Chinese had simply approximated the value of pi as 3, until Liu Xin approximated it at 3.154 sometime between 1‚Äì5 CE, although the method he used to reach this value is unknown to historians.Needham (1986a), 99‚Äì100. Standard measuring vessels dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9‚Äì23 CE) also showed approximations for pi at 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.167.Berggren, Borwein & Borwein (2004), 27. Zhang Heng is the next known Han mathematician to have made an approximation for pi. Han mathematicians understood that the area of a square versus the area of its inscribed circle had an approximate ratio of 4:3, and also understood that the volume of a cube and the volume of its inscribed sphere would be 42:32. With D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=9‚ÅÑ16D3, a formula Zhang found fault with since he realized the value for diameter was inaccurate, the discrepancy being the value taken for the ratio.Berggren & Borwein (2004), 27; Arndt, Haenel, & Lischka (2001), 176. To fix this, Zhang added 1‚ÅÑ16D3 to the formula, thus V = 9‚ÅÑ16D3 \\\\+ 1‚ÅÑ16D3 = 5‚ÅÑ8D3. Since he found the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the ratio of the area of a square to the inscribed circle is :.Berggren & Borwein (2004), 27; Arndt, Haenel, & Lischka (2001), 177. With this formula, Zhang was able to approximate pi as the square root of 10, or 3.162.de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Berggren & Borwein (2004), 27; Arndt, Haenel, & Lischka (2001), 177. After the Han, Liu Hui approximated pi as 3.14159, while the mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429‚Äì500) approximated pi at 3.141592 (or 355‚ÅÑ113), the most accurate approximation the ancient Chinese would achieve.Needham (1986a), 100‚Äì101; Berggren, Borwein & Borwein (2004), 20 & 24‚Äì26. Musical tuning and theory Mathematics were also used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, compiled by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179‚Äì122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale.McClain & Ming (1979), 207‚Äì208. Jing Fang (78‚Äì37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves.McClain & Ming (1979), 212; Needham (1986b), 218‚Äì219. By calculating the difference at 177147‚ÅÑ176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620‚Äì1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536‚Äì1611) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548‚Äì1620) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.Temple (1986), 209; Needham (1986b), 227‚Äì228. Astronomical observations The Han-era Chinese observed and tracked the movements of Halley's comet in 12 BCE, seen here in its 1986 reappearance. The ancient Chinese made careful observations of heavenly bodies and phenomena since observations of the cosmos were used for astrology and prognostication.Loewe (1994), 61‚Äì79. The astronomer Gan De (fl. 4th century BCE) from the State of Qi was the first in history to acknowledge sunspots as genuine solar phenomena (and not obstructing natural satellites as thought in the West after Einhard's observation in 807), while the first precisely dated sunspot observation in China occurred on May 10, 28 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33‚Äì37 BCE).Temple (1986), 29‚Äì30. Among the Mawangdui Silk Texts dated no later than 168 BCE (when they were sealed in a tomb at Mawangdui Han tombs site, Changsha, Hunan province), the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan Â§©ÊñáÊ∞£Ë±°ÈõúÂç†) manuscript illustrates in writings and ink drawings roughly three-hundred different climatic and astronomical features including clouds, mirages, rainbows, stars, constellations, and comets.Loewe (1994), 61; Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 173‚Äì175. Another silk text from the same site reports the times and locations of the rising and setting of planets in the night sky from the years 246‚Äì177 BCE.Loewe (1994), 65‚Äì66. The Han-era Chinese noted the passage of the same comet seen in Persia for the birth of Mithridates II of Parthia in 135 BCE, the same comet the Romans observed close to the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, Halley's comet in 12 BCE, the same comet noted by Roman historian Cassius Dio (c. 155 ‚Äì c. 229 CE) for 13 CE, and (what is now known to have been) a supernova in AD 185.Loewe (1994), 69. For various comets discussed in the Han-era history books Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han, details are given for their position in the sky and direction they were moving, the length of time they were visible, their color, and their size.Loewe (1994), 75‚Äì76. The Han-era Chinese also made star catalogues, such as historian Sima Qian's (145‚Äì86 BCE) A Monograph on Celestial Officials (Tianguanshu Â§©ÂÆòÊõ∏) and Zhang Heng's 2nd-century-CE star catalogue which featured roughly 2,500 stars and 124 constellations.de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Balchin (2003), 27; Sun & Kristemaker (1997), 5 & 21‚Äì23. To create a three- dimensional representation of such observations,Sun & Kistemaker (1997), 25 & 62. Astronomer Geng Shouchang (ËÄøÂ£ΩÊòå) provided his armillary sphere with an equatorial ring in 52 BCE. By 84 CE, the elliptical ring was added to the armillary sphere, while Zhang Heng's model of 125 added the celestial horizon ring and meridian ring.Needham (1986a), 343; Barbieri-Low (2007), 203. Han calendars Han-dynasty paintings on tile; being conscious of time, the Chinese believed in guardian spirits for the divisions of day and night, such as these two guardians here representing 11 pm to 1 am (left) and 5 am to 7 am (right). The Han Chinese used astronomical studies mainly to construct and revise their calendar. In contrast to the Julian calendar (46 BCE) and Gregorian calendar (1582) of the West (but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece), the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year.Cullen (2006), 7; Lloyd (1996), 168. During the spring and autumn periods of the 5th century BCE, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (Âè§ÂõõÂàÜÂéÜ), which measured the tropical year at 3651‚ÅÑ4 days (like the Julian calendar of Rome).Deng (2005), 67. Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar (Â§™ÂàùÂéÜ) in 104 BCE, which measured the tropical year at 365385‚ÅÑ1539 days and the lunar month at 2943‚ÅÑ81 days. Since the Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries, Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75‚Äì88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar.de Crespigny (2007), 498. Later, astronomer Guo Shoujing (1233‚Äì1316) would set the tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar (ÊéàÊôÇÊõÜ), the same value used in the Gregorian calendar.Deng (2005), 67‚Äì69. Besides the use of the calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle‚Äîconstructed by celestial stems (gan Âπ≤) and Earthly Branches (zhi ÊîØ), each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac.Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 167. Astronomical theory Zhao Shaung's 3rd-century commentary in the Zhoubi suanjing describes two astronomical theories: in one, the heavens are shaped as a hemi- spherical dome extending over the earth, while the other compares the earth to the central yolk of an egg, where the heavens are shaped as a celestial sphere around the earth. The latter astronomical theory was mentioned by Yang Xiong in his Model Sayings (Fayan Ê≥ïË®Ä) and expounded on by Zhang Heng in his Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian ÈùàÊÜ≤) of 120 CE.Dauben (2007), 214; Balchin (2003), 27; Huang (1988), 64; Sun & Kistemaker (1997), 62. Thus, the Han-era Chinese believed in a geocentric model for the immediate solar system and greater universe, as opposed to a heliocentric model. Illustration of a lunar eclipse, where the Earth obstructs the path of sunlight to the Moon The Han-era Chinese discussed the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, or were they rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets.Needham (1986a), 227. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it.Needham (1986a), 414. He also repeated Jing's comment that the side of the moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth. In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27‚Äì100 CE) wrote that some Han thinkers believed that rain fell from the Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located).Needham (1986a), 468. Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle. Structural engineering and public works Materials and construction This Eastern-Han painting of a watchtower with a drum is dated 176 CE and was found in a tomb of Anping, Hebei province. The ruins of a Han-dynasty watchtower made of rammed earth at Dunhuang, Gansu province, the eastern end of the Silk Road A rubbing of a Han pictorial stone showing an ancestral worship hall (citang Á•†Â†Ç) Timber was the chief building material in Han architecture.Ebrey (1999), 76. It was used for grand palace halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, and humble abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907).Steinhardt (2004), 228‚Äì238. Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, as well as the often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture.Thorp (1986), 360‚Äì378. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and rammed earth walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), rammed earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls.Wang (1982), 1 & 30, 39‚Äì40, 148‚Äì149; Chang (2007), 91‚Äì92. Sections of the Han-era rammed earth Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations.Morton & Lewis (2005), 56. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of rammed earth.Chang (2007), 91‚Äì92. Thatched or tiled roofs were supported by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture. Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they were supported by dougong brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.Ebrey (1999), 76; Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 275‚Äì277. Courtyard homes Valuable clues about Han architecture can be found in Han artwork of ceramic models, paintings, and carved or stamped bricks discovered in tombs and other sites. The layout of Han tombs were also built like underground houses, comparable to the scenes of courtyard houses found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models. Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by stairways. Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as watchtowers. The halls were built with intersecting crossbeams and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; stairways and walls were usually plastered over to produce a smooth surface and then painted.Loewe (1968), 138‚Äì139. Chang'an and Luoyang, the Han capitals The ruins of the walls of Han's first capital Chang'an still stand today at in height with a base width of .Wang (1982), 1‚Äì2. Modern archaeological surveys have proven that the eastern wall was long, the southern wall was long, the western wall was long, and the northern wall was 7,200 (23,622 ft) long. Overall the total length of walls equalled , and formed a roughly square layout (although the southern and northern walls had sections which zigzagged due to topographical concerns: rough terrain existed along the southern wall and the course of the Wei River obstructed the straight path of the northern wall). The city's moat was wide and deep; the remains of what were wooden bridges have been discovered along the moat.Wang (1982), 2. Chang'an had twelve gatehouses leading into the city, three for each side of the wall, and acted as terminus points for the main avenues.Wang (1982), 2‚Äì3. Every gatehouse had three gateway entrances that were each wide; Han-era writers claimed that each gateway could accommodate the traffic of four horse-drawn carriages at once. The drainage system included many drainholes that were dug under these gates and lined with bricks that form arches, where ceramic water pipes have been found that once connected to the ditches built alongside the major streets.Wang (1982), 4. Only some wall sections and platform foundations of the city's once lavish imperial palaces remain.Wang (1982), 4‚Äì6. Likewise, the stone foundations of the armory were also discovered, but its wooden architecture had long since disappeared. Some sections of the wall ruins of Han's second capital Luoyang still stand at in height and in width at the base.Bielenstein (1986), 262; Wang (1982), 30. The eastern wall was long, the western wall was long, and the northern wall was long, yet the southern wall was washed away when the Luo River changed its course centuries ago; by using the terminus points of the eastern and western walls, historians estimate that the southern wall was long. The overall walled enclosure formed a rectangular shape, yet with some disruptive curves due to topographical obstructions.Wang (1982), 30. Like Chang'an, Luoyang had twelve gatehouses, three for each side of the wall, while each gatehouse had three gateway entrances which led to major avenues within the city.Wang (1982), 30‚Äì31. The rammed earth foundational platforms of religious altars and terraces still stand today outside of the walled perimeter of Luoyang, dedicated to the worship of deities and where state sacrifices were conducted.Wang (1982), 39. They were approached by long ramps and once had timber halls built on top with verandas on the lower levels. vaulted tomb chamber at Luoyang made of small bricks Underground tombs By the 1980s, over ten thousand brick-and-stone underground Han tombs had been discovered throughout China.Wang (1982), 175. Earlier Chinese tombs dating to the Warring States were often vertically dug pits lined with wooden walls.Wang (1982), 176. In digging the tomb sites, Han workers would first build vertical pits and then dig laterally, hence the name \\"horizontal pits\\" for Han tombs; this method was also used for tomb sites dug into the sides of mountains. The walls of most Western Han tombs were built of large hollow bricks while the smaller, non-hollow brick type that dominated Eastern Han tomb architecture (with some made out of stone) appeared in the late Western Han.Wang (1982), 175, 177‚Äì178. The smaller brick type was better-suited for Han tomb archways at entrances, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs.Wang (1982), 175, 177‚Äì178; Needham (1986d), 179‚Äì180. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits.Watson (2000), 108. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown. The layout of tombs dug into the sides of mountains typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls. The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.Fong (1991), 155. A total of twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que) from the Han dynasty have survived and can be found in the aboveground areas around Han tomb and shrine sites.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 279; Wang (1982), 179‚Äì180. They often formed part of outer walls, usually flanking an entry but sometimes at the corners of walled enclosures.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 279; Liu (2002), 55. Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and balustrades.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 279‚Äì280; Liu (2002), 55. Boreholes and mining shafts On Han tomb brick reliefs of Sichuan province, scenes of borehole drilling for mining projects are shown. They show towering derricks lifting liquid brine through bamboo pipes to the surface so that the brine could be distilled in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce salt.Loewe (1968), 191‚Äì194. The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by bamboo pipes, with gas brought up from below the surface. The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the boring tool was rotated by a draft animal, usually oxen or water buffaloes.Tom (1989), 103. Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface.Ronan (1994), 91. Mining shafts dating to the Han dynasty have been found which reach depths of hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the earth, complete with spacious underground rooms structured by timber frames along with ladders and iron tools left behind.Loewe (1968), 191‚Äì194; Wang (1982), 105. Ceramic model buildings There are Han-era literary references to tall towers found in the capital cities; they often served as watchtowers, astronomical observatories, and religious establishments meant to attract the favor of immortals.Loewe (1968), 132‚Äì133. The court eunuchs Zhao Zhong and Zhang Rang discouraged the aloof Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168‚Äì189 CE) from ascending to the top floors of tall towers (claiming it would cause bad luck), in order to conceal from him the enormous palatial mansions the eunuchs built for themselves in Luoyang.de Crespigny (2007), 513‚Äì514. It is not known for certain whether or not miniature ceramic models of residential towers and watchtowers found in Han-dynasty tombs are completely faithful representations of such timber towers, yet they reveal vital clues about lost timber architecture. There are only a handful of existing ceramic models of multi- story towers from pre-Han and Western Han eras; the bulk of the hundreds of towers found so far were made during the Eastern Han period.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 275‚Äì278. Model towers could be fired as one piece in the kiln or assembled from several different ceramic pieces to create the whole.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 275‚Äì277. No one tower is a duplicate of the other, yet they share common features. They often had a walled courtyard at the bottom, a balcony with balustrades and windows for every floor, roof tiles capping and concealing the ceiling rafters, human figures peering out the windows or standing on the balconies, door knockers, and pets such as dogs in the bottom courtyard.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 275‚Äì277, 280; Steinhardt (2005), \\"Tower Model,\\" 283. Perhaps the most direct pieces of evidence to suggest that miniature ceramic tower models are faithful representations of real-life Han timber towers are tile patterns.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Tower Model\\" 283‚Äì284. Artistic patterns found on the circular tiles that cap the eave-ends on the miniature models are exact matches of patterns found on real-life Han roof tiles excavated at sites such as the royal palaces in Chang'an and Luoyang, and even the tiles of the original White Horse Temple.

This includes multi-story storehouses such as granaries, courtyard houses with multi-story halls, kiosks, walled gate towers, mills, manufactories and workshops, animal pens, outhouses, and water wells.Steinhardt (2005), \\"Pleasure Tower Model,\\" 278. Even models of single-story farmhouses show a great amount of detail, including tiled roofs, courtyards, steps leading to walkways, farmyards with troughs and basins, parapets, and privies.Juliano (2005), \\"Model Farm,\\" 287. Models of granaries and storehouses had tiled rooftops, dougong brackets, windows, and stilt supports raising them above ground level.Hiromi (2005), \\"Storehouse Model,\\" 291. Han models of water wells sometimes feature tiny tiled roofs supported by beams that house the rope pulley used for lifting the bucket.Liu (2005), \\"Green-glazed Wellhead,\\" 293.

These include repairs and renovation work on the Dujiangyan Irrigation System of Sichuan and Zhengguo Canal of Shaanxi, both of which were built by the previous State of Qin.Wang (1982), 59. Accepting the proposal of Ni Kuan (:zh:ÂÖíÂØ¨), in 111 BCE Emperor Wu commissioned Er to lead the project of creating extensions to the Zhengguo Canal that could irrigate nearby terrain elevated above the main canal.Needham (1986d), 286. Since a large amount of silt had built up over time at the bottom of the Zhengguo Canal (causing flooding), in 95 BCE another project was initiated to tap irrigation waters from further up the Jing River, requiring the dredging of a new long canal following a contour line above the Zhengguo. The Han state also maintained a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.Brian Lander. ‚ÄúState Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.‚Äù T‚Äôoung Pao 100.4‚Äì5 (2014): 325‚Äì62. Rubbing detail from Stone Chamber 1 on the West Wall of the Wu family shrines in Shandong Province, China, showing a battle fought at a bridge crossing, dated 2nd century CE Roadways, wooden bridges, postal stations, and relay stations were occasionally repaired, while many new facilities such as these were established.Ebrey (1986), 613‚Äì614; Needham (1986d), 35‚Äì37. As written by Han authors, roads built during the Han were tamped down with metal rammers, yet there is uncertainty over the materials used; Joseph Needham speculates that they were rubble and gravel.Needham (1986d), 7. The widths of roads ranged from narrow footpaths where only a single horse or oxen could pass at once to large highways that could accommodate the simultaneous passage of nine horse-drawn chariots abreast.Needham (1986d), 5‚Äì7. Fortified Han roadways were built as far west as Shanshan (Loulan) near the Lop Desert, while Han forces utilized routes that traversed north of the Taklamakan Desert towards Kashgar.Needham (1986d), 18. A vast network of roads, fortified passes, and wooden bridges built over rushing torrents in steep gorges of the Qin Mountains was consolidated during the Han, known as the gallery roads.Needham (1986d), 19‚Äì21. During the reign of Emperor Wu, roads were built to connect newly conquered territories in what is now Yunnan in the far southwest as well as the Korean Peninsula in the far northeast.Needham (1986d), 24‚Äì25. One of the most common bridge-types built during the Han was the wooden-trestle beam bridge, described by literary sources and seen in reliefs carved on tomb bricks.Needham (1986d), 149‚Äì150. Evidence for arch bridges is elusive: one outside of Chengdu's south gate is claimed to date to the Han period, while that built by Ma Xian (È¶¨Ë≥¢) (fl. 135 CE) was certainly a beam bridge.Needham (1986d), 171‚Äì172. In artwork, a relief sculpture from a Han tomb in Sichuan province shows an arch bridge with a gradual curve, suggesting that it is segmental, although the use of such bridges are not entirely confirmed.Liu (2002), 56. Although there are rare references to simple suspension bridges in Han sources, these are only mentioned in connection with travels to foreign countries in the Himalaya, Hindukush and Afghanistan, demonstrating the antiquity of the invention there.Needham (1986d), 187‚Äì188. Floating pontoon bridges made of boats secured by iron chains were built during the Han (some even spanning the Yellow River and Yangzi River) and were most often employed for military purposes since they could be easily assembled and then disassembled.Needham (1986d), 161; Bielenstein (1986), 255. Medicine The Mawangdui Silk Texts, found in the Mawangdui, Changsha, Hunan province, provide information not only on astronomy and mythology, but also on Han-era medicine. Much of the beliefs held by Han-era physicians are known to modern historians through such texts as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (Huangdi neijing) medical corpus, which was compiled from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE and was mentioned in the Book of Later Han.Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 181‚Äì182. It is clear from this text and others that their metaphysical beliefs in the five phases and yin and yang dictated their medical decisions and assumptions.Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 181‚Äì182; Sun & Kistemaker (1997), 3‚Äì4. The Han-era Chinese believed that each organ in the body was associated with one of the five phases (metal Èáë, wood Êú®, water Ê∞¥, fire ÁÅ´, earth Âúü) and had two circulatory qi channels (‰ªªÁù£‰∫åËÑâ). If these channels were disrupted, Han medical texts suggest that one should consume an edible material associated with one of these phases that would counteract the organ's prescribed phase and thus restore one's health. For example, the Chinese believed that when the heart‚Äîassociated with the fire phase‚Äîcaused one to become sluggish, then one should eat sour food because it was associated with the wood phase (which promoted fire). The Han Chinese also believed that by using pulse diagnosis, a physician could determine which organ of the body emitted \\"vital energy\\" (qi) and what qualities the latter had, in order to figure out the exact disorder the patient was suffering.Hsu (2001), 75. Despite the influence of metaphysical theory on medicine, Han texts also give practical advice, such as the proper way to perform clinical lancing to remove an abscess.Hsu (2001), 28‚Äì29. The Huangdi neijing noted the symptoms and reactions of people with various diseases of the liver, heart, spleen, lung, or kidneys in a 24-hour period, which was a recognition of circadian rhythm, although explained in terms of the five phases.Temple (1986), 124‚Äì126. In his Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber (Jinkui yaolue), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150 ‚Äì c. 219 CE) was the first to suggest a regulated diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314‚Äì1330) to prescribe a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for beriberi.Temple (1986), 131. Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun).de Crespigny (2007), 1055. His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology.de Crespigny (2007), 332. Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month. In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments. Historical sources say that Hua Tuo rarely practiced moxibustion and acupuncture. The first mentioning of acupuncture in Chinese literature appeared in the Huangdi neijing.Omura (2003), 15. Acupuncture needles made of gold were found in the tomb of the Han King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE). Some stone-carved depictions of acupuncture date to the Eastern Han Era (25‚Äì220 CE).Omura (2003), 19‚Äì22. Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life- prolonging exercises of calisthenics. In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the Mawangdui, illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and captions.Loewe (1994), 65. Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of taijiquan and qigong are derived from Han-era calisthenics.Lo (2001), 23. Cartography Map-making in China preceded the Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, displaying the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues that these are to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE ‚Äì 24 CE).Hsu (1993), 90‚Äì93. Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps.Hsu (1993), 90‚Äì93; Hansen (2000), 125. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.Hansen (2000), 125. An early Western-Han silk map found in tomb 3 of Mawangdui Han tombs site, depicting the Kingdom of Changsha and Kingdom of Nanyue in southern China (note: the south direction is oriented at the top). In Chinese literature, the oldest reference to a map comes from the year 227 BCE, when the assassin Jing Ke was to present a map to Ying Zheng Â¨¥Êîø, King of Qin (ruling later as Qin Shi Huang, r. 221‚Äì210 BCE) on behalf of Crown Prince Dan of Yan. Instead of presenting the map, he pulled out a dagger from his scroll, yet was unable to kill Ying Zheng.Needham (1986a), 534‚Äì535. The Rites of Zhou (Zhouli), compiled during the Han and commented by Liu Xin in the 1st century CE, mentioned the use of maps for governmental provinces and districts, principalities, frontier boundaries, and locations of ores and minerals for mining facilities. The first Chinese gazetteer was written in 52 CE and included information on territorial divisions, the founding of cities, and local products and customs.Hargett (1996), 406. Pei Xiu (224‚Äì271 CE) was the first to describe in detail the use of a graduated scale and geometrically plotted reference grid.Hsu (1993), 93‚Äì94; Needham (1986a), 538‚Äì540. However, historians Howard Nelson, Robert Temple, and Rafe de Crespigny argue that there is enough literary evidence that Zhang Heng's now lost work of 116 CE established the geometric reference grid in Chinese cartography (including a line from the Book of Later Han: \\"[Zhang Heng] cast a network of coordinates about heaven and earth, and reckoned on the basis of it\\").de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Nelson (1974), 359; Temple (1986), 30; see also Barbieri-Low (2007), 203. Although there is speculation fueled by the report in Sima's Records of the Grand Historian that a gigantic raised-relief map representing the Qin Empire is located within the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, it is known that small raised-relief maps were created during the Han dynasty, such as one made out of rice by the military officer Ma Yuan (14 BCE ‚Äì 49 CE).Temple (1986), 179. Nautics and vehicles junk An Eastern-Han pottery ship model with a steering rudder at the stern and anchor at the bow In 1975, an ancient shipyard discovered in Guangzhou is now dated to the late 3rd century BCE, made during either the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BCE) or early Western Han dynasty. It had three large platforms capable of building wooden ships that were long, wide, and had a weight capacity of 60 metric tons. Another Han shipyard in what is now Anhui province had a government-operated maritime workshop where battle ships were assembled.Nishijima (1986), 582. The widespread use of iron tools during the Han dynasty was essential for crafting such vessels. The southward expansion of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue in what is now modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route.Nishijima (1986), 579‚Äì580. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route.Nishijima (1986), 579‚Äì580; Liu (1988), 19; de Crespigny (2007), 600. By at least the 1st century CE‚Äîas proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs‚Äîthe Chinese would have been able to brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar.Needham (1986d), 627‚Äì628; Chung (2005), 152; Tom (1989), 103‚Äì104; Adshead (2000), 156; Fairbank & Goldman (1998), 93; Block (2003), 93 & 123. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun Ëàπ) created by the 1st century was China's first seaworthy sailing ship.Needham (1986d), 678; Turnbull (2002), 4 & 14‚Äì16; Woodman (2002), 6. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat- bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts.Turnbull (2002), 14; Needham (1986d), 390‚Äì391. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century).Adshead (2000), 156; Mott (1991), 2‚Äì3, 92, 84, 95f. As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.Temple (1986), 187. A pottery model of a horse-drawn, roofed chariot from the Eastern Han period Although horse and ox- drawn carts and spoke-wheeled chariots had existed in China long before the Han dynasty, it was not until the 1st century BCE that literary evidence pointed to the invention of the wheelbarrow, while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods.Needham (1986c), 263‚Äì267; Greenberger (2006), 13. While the 'throat-and- girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount of pressure on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as seen on a Chu lacquerware).Needham (1986c), 310; Temple (1986), 21. By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer breast strap, as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs.Needham (1986c), 308‚Äì312. In the final stage of evolution, the modern horse collar was invented in China by the 5th century, during the Northern Wei period.Needham (1986c), 319‚Äì323. Weaponry and war machines The pivot catapult, known as the traction trebuchet, had existed in China since the Warring States period (as evidenced by the Mozi).Turnbull (2001), 18. It was regularly used in sieges during the Han dynasty, by both besiegers and the besieged. The most common projectile weapon used during the Han dynasty was the small handheld, trigger-activated crossbow (and to a lesser extent, the repeating crossbow), first invented in China during the 6th or 5th century BCE.You (1994), 80; Wagner (1993), 153 & 157‚Äì158; Mao (1998), 109‚Äì110; Wright (2001), 42 & 159; Lin (1993), 36. Although the nomadic Xiongnu were able to twist their waists slightly while horse-riding and shoot arrows at targets behind them, the official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) deemed the Chinese crossbow superior to the Xiongnu bow.Di Cosmo (2002), 203. The Han Chinese also employed chemical warfare. In quelling a peasant revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows that were used to pump powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed.Needham (1986f), 167. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations. To deter pursuits of marching infantry or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made caltrops (barbed iron balls with sharp spikes sticking out in all directions) that could be scattered on the ground and pierce the feet or hooves of those who were unaware of them.

History Historic lorry in the mine After closure of the salt mining activities, Bartensleben was designated as a repository for radioactive waste by the former government of East Germany. Today, the shaft is operated by the Deutsche Gesellschaft zum Bau und Betrieb von Endlagern f√ºr Abfallstoffe mbH (DBE) under supervision of the Bundesamt f√ºr Strahlenschutz. Potash The salt mining industry in this region is over a century-old, started with the first potash mining shaft \\"Marie\\" in 1897. Shaft \\"Bartensleben\\" started between 1910‚Äì1912 and is of current depth 525 m. The mine levels in shaft \\"Bartensleben\\" are interconnected with shaft \\"Marie\\" at depths 326, 426, 466 and 506 m. The main mine structure is between 320 and 630m depth. Weapon production and forced labor During the Third Reich, from February 1944 until April 1945, forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners from Ravensbr√ºck, and Buchenwald were employed. From August 1944, 2,500 German, Soviet, Polish, Hungarian and French female concentration camp prisoners, also from the Neuengamme camp, were moved to the Beendorf camp. Initially this was a subcamp of Buchenwald and latterly of the Neuengamme camp. They worked in the salt mine. They were forced to work in the tunnels of more than 400 meters depth on the production of components for the Me 262 jet aircraft and for rockets, including the V1 and V2. The components included parts for guidance systems. For secrecy the underground shafts \\"Marie\\" at Beendorf and \\"Bartensleben\\" in Morsleben were named \\"Bulldog\\" and \\"Polecat\\". Site selection Mine Bartensleben in 1957 In 1965 the Staatliche Zentrale f√ºr Strahlenschutz (SZS) of East Germany (later: Staatliches Amt f√ºr Atomsicherheit und Strahlenschutz (SAAS)) started with a search for a central storage location for all types of radioactive waste. During the selection process, ten sites were considered. Three of them came up for the final selection, which included the shafts \\"Bartensleben\\" (Morsleben) and \\"Marie\\" (Beendorf). In 1965 the decision was made to select Morsleben as the site for the \\"Zentralen Endlager Grube Bartensleben\\" (ZEGB). Important criteria were salt as a disposal medium, the size and availability of caverns and the early viability of the mine. The site permits were issued in 1972-73. Inventory The first partial authorization for retrievable storage of 500 cubic meters of radioactive waste from the crowded central storage depot in Lohmen near Dresden, East Germany was granted in 1971/72. These deposits were made due to economic considerations ahead of the conversion operations (deployment authorization of 1974) of the salt mine as a disposal site. In the years that followed smaller quantities of radioactive materials were stored until the commissioning approval in 1978/79. On 20 June 1981 the temporary approval for continuous use was published, followed by the final license on 22 April 1986. A request for a closure permit, under which the evidence of long-term security had to be provided, was not granted. In the late 1980s the preparations started for an additional approval stage for the storage of high level radioactive waste. In the wake of the unification of East and West Germany the approval process was halted. In the first storage period from 1971 to February 1991, approximately 14 432 cubic meters of intermediate- and low level radioactive waste and 6 227 sealed objects with a total activity of about 0.29 PBq were stored. The waste came mainly from the Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant and Rheinsberg Nuclear Power Plant and from the ELBE of the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf research reactor. The rest of the radiation and radioactive waste sources were products from the radionuclides used in research, medicine and industry and consisted of about 40% solid waste, particularly mixed and solidified evaporator concentrates, and almost 60% of liquid evaporator concentrate. In the context of the German reunification the responsibility for the repository was transferred to the Bundesamt f√ºr Strahlenschutz (BfS). In the period 1994 to 1998 approximately 22 320 m¬≥ of radioactive waste with a total activity of 0.08 TBq alpha radiation and 91 TBq in beta and gamma radiation was stored in Morsleben. 88% of the waste came from the entire federal territory and the nuclear powerplants in Rheinsberg and Lubmin. 3% of the waste came from the national depots, and a further 9% from research institutions and other bodies. Again it was primarily mixed waste, evaporator concentrates, resins, waste under high pressure and sealed sources. The nuclear industry contributed 138 Million Euro in the period 1994-1998 for deposit costs.Merkels Altlast Altogether, up to the termination of the storage operation in 1998 (including the period before reunification) at least 36 753 m¬≥ of low and intermediate level radioactive waste was stored in Morsleben. With an additional 6 621 (other sources speak of 6 892) sealed sources, the total radiation activity is specified at about 0.38 PBq . Delayed closure Filling station in 375 m depth The request on October 13, 1992 from Saxony- Anhalt's Ministry of Environment to initiate a planning process under ¬ß 9 b AtG for the continued operation of the site from June 30, 2000 onwards was limited on May 9, 1997 to a decommissioning of the repository Morsleben. The Bundesamt f√ºr Strahlenschutz notified the planning authority on April 17, 2001 that it irrevocably waived approval of the regulations that permit the continued use of the site and acceptance of other radioactive waste and their storage in the repository Morsleben. The planning procedure for the closure will now be accelerated. Whether it succeeds to stabilize the mine and maintain long-term security is still unclear. Since the suspension of nuclear waste storage in Morsleben in 1998 the stability of the salt domes deteriorated to a state in which collapse could occur. Since 2003 480,000 m3 of salt-concretepumpversatz has been pumped into the pit to temporarily stabilize the upper levels.

Plot The film follows Chris Vale (Scot Nery) who was admitted to an asylum at the age of 12, after witnessing his mother's rape and murder by two thugs hired by his father (who subsequently committed suicide). Chris barely survived being shot in the head by one of the thugs. Now a 22-year-old grossly disfigured young man, he escapes from the asylum on Halloween after killing two orderlies who mock his wearing of masks that resemble those the thugs were wearing. His old home is now inhabited by David Bexter's (Derek Osedach) family; Bexter hosts a Halloween party there with his girlfriend Shannon (Rebekah Kochan), his friends, and his schoolmates. Vale kills a party-goer named Todd (Nicholas Daly Clark) at a gas station, steals his costume and his car, and drives to the party. At the party Vale is taken for Todd by everyone and starts a killing spree unnoticed. Meanwhile, David fakes a dispute with a friend who kidnaps Vale (who still is taken for Todd) with a gun, and another friend disguised as a police officer, who is forced to hand over the keys of his car. After escaping with the car, the kidnapper is murdered by Vale, who goes back to the party in it. Because someone at the party has called the real police, the angry officer ends the party by telling everyone to go home, leaving only David, the now disappointed Shannon, and some friends. Vale enters the house again, kills several of the remaining people and ties up Shannon who is wearing the collar of his mother that was found in the house earlier. He breaks up a hole in the wall that was covered with boards where the corpse of his mother was hidden by his father before committing suicide. As one girl escapes from the house in panic David begins to search for Shannon, finding her captured in the basement. After freeing her Vale knocks out David from behind but Shannon manages to grab a gun that Vale has lost shooting him twice, presuming the killer for dead. As the police and ambulance arrives later David seems to have disappeared with the police searching for him. Suddenly a hooded person appears behind a police officer who is talking to Shannon. Shannon grabs the officers gun shooting and killing the hooded person, after removing the hood she is shocked to see that she killed David. In the final scene Vale is seen hitch-hiking and picked up by a car-driver who presumes him to having a long Halloween party night. The film ends while the car leaves.

Its artists are credited for the Madras Movement of Art (1950s‚Äì1980s), which brought modernism to art in South India. Their work is widely recognized as some of the best art produced in postwar India and is shown regularly in galleries across the country. Several Cholamandal artists have also shown in Europe, the United States and South America. In the village Injambakkam, 9 km from Chennai, India, it has over 20 resident painters and sculptors, who live as a community and pool their skills. They run the Artists Handicrafts Association, a cooperative which manages the village and sale of works through the permanent exhibition at the complex, which includes paintings, sketches, terra-cotta/stone/metal sculptures, batiks and handicrafts etc., making the village a self-supporting entity.Cholamandal Artists' Village The community was founded by K. C. S. Paniker, the principal of the Madras School of Arts, along with his students and a few artists associated with the college. It used the \`art-meets-craft' approach where artists made handicrafts for a living as they pursued their art. By the 1970s, the village became self-sufficient and grew into one of the most important meeting places for international artists in India. Today, it is one of the few artist-driven movements in India. Four decades on, it is one of the few artists' colonies in the world to survive successfully and its foundation remains one of the \\"10 biggest art moments\\" in India. History Most of the original founding creative artists, painters and sculptors were students and artists associated with the Government School of Arts and Crafts, Chennai (Madras School of Arts), where [K.C.S. Paniker], noted metaphysical and abstract painter, was principal 1957 to 1967. These artists desired to form a congenial space for practising their art; 38 of them got together and formed the 'Artists Handicrafts Association' (AHA) in 1963 initially to sell the works of artists. Gradually, the artists started working together, producing handicrafts in their spare time. They were among the first in the country to produce batik fabric; proceeds of their first batik exhibition went into buying the of land in 1966, which was to make up the village. By now K.C.S. Paniker had retired and founded the artists commune in April 1966. It was named after the Chola dynasty, which is known to have encouraged arts and ruled the region, 9-13th century AD ‚Äî called Cholamandalam in Tamil, which literally translated as the realm of the Cholas. Chola also lends its name to the Coromandel Coast of Bay of Bengal, which is a short walk from the village. Paniker was \\"worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions\\". In the same year six artists moved into live and work on their own land. In the 60s, while they could hardly sell their paintings, avant garde wood and leather work, batik, ceramics and metal craft, they found a good market. This sustained them, while the local buyers were familiarized to modernism, which their art represented. Electricity was provided in 1968 and till 1972 the mud road ended at Muttukadu. The village was on a lonely, bumpy road, now known as the East Coast Road highway to Mahabalipuram, from Adyar. Chennai was further away, though today, it is right at its door steps, and the road is busy with traffic and shops and commercial establishments. Over the years, built their houses, studios, exhibition gallery, theatre, workshop and kitchen, which they jointly owned along with all the infrastructure of the village. It nurtured artists such as J. Sultan Ali, Dr. K.M. Gopal S. Kanniappan, K. Ramanujam, M. Reddeppa Naidu, S. P. Jayakar, K. R. Harie, P. S. Nandan, Akkitham Narayanan, Namboothiri, D. Venkatapathy, Haridasan, S. Nanda Gopal, S. G. Vasudev, K. Jayapala Panicker, Gopinath, Senathipathy, M. V. Devan and Richard Jesudas. Soon they formed a cooperative to look after the village and built a gallery, which displayed and sold their works; 20% of their sales went to the ‚ÄòCholamandal Artists Handicrafts Association‚Äô, which used the funds for village upkeep. In time the cooperative became self- sufficient and held exhibitions of their work in major cities of India. K. C. S. Paniker died in 1977. By this time the module had proven sustainable. Over the years, work done by the artists at the village, initiated a period in south Indian art called the 'Madras Movement', which brought modernism to south Indian art. The Progressive Painters‚Äô Association (P.P.A.), one of the oldest art associations in India founded by Paniker in Chennai in 1944; it was inactive for many year after Paniker's death. The association was revived in 2006 and a new committee formed. It is now being carried forward by artists at the village and an annually elected general council of members administers Cholamandal. The village continues to produce artists of great talent such as S. Ravi Shankar, A. Selveraj and Shailesh B.O. amongst many others. Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art During his last days Paniker had offered his oeuvre to the Madras government on the condition that a separate gallery be created for his work. When no response came from the government, the Trivandrum Art Gallery took up the offer and now houses an important collection of Paniker's work. The artists at the village wanted a place to display the work of the Madras Movement, thus idea of the art museum took place. The artists raised money from the private sector to fund a museum in the village, which would house a permanent collection of artworks representative of the Madras Movement. While the initial design was made by a visiting Dutch couple, the design for the art centre was made by architects Sheila Sri Prakash of Shilpa Architects and M. V. Devan. As the project gathered momentum help came in from artists and corporates alike. After three and half years of construction the building was finished ‚Äî thus started a long search for works that exemplified the Madras Movement, which flourished between the early 50s and the 80s. Eventually about 60 per cent of the works were donated by senior artists and the rest were given on extended loan by art collectors around the country. The Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art opened on 1 February 2009. It has a 'Museum of the Madras Movement', which display works of prominent artists of the movement (apart from that of Paniker) including J. Sultan Ali, K. M. Gopal M. Senathipathi, Late A. P. Santhanaraj, P.S. Nandhan, S. G. Vasudev, K.V. Haridasan, Thota Tharani, sculptor S. Nandagopal. The centre has two commercial galleries, 'Labernum' and 'Indigo', that can be rented free of commission charge, an art book store, and a craft shop. It is surrounded by tree-shaded sands which sport an international sculpture garden, displaying sculptures made by visiting artists from across India and the world through the decades. Facilities Today, the village houses art galleries, museums, and an open-air theatre for dance and theatre performances. The original Artists Handicrafts Association is still in charge of the colony, and Paniker's son, sculptor S. Nandagopal, is the secretary of the village. Out of the original 40 artists, many are no more, and some have moved out, only 21 remain today. Cholamandal does not accept new members, though it has at least a dozen artists living or working there at any time, plus many artists-in-residence are at work. The village is open daily from 10am to 5pm. It is 10-minute walking distance from the Golden Beach. Local transport is easily available, and the Chennai International Airport is the nearest airport.

YSJBC is the longest standing club of the university and has an affiliation to the British Rowing. The club has 50 members and is one of the clubs of the York St John Students' Union. The vast majority of members learn to row on arrival at university. YSJBC welcomes students, alumni and staff to participate in the club. The boathouse is based beside the River Ouse, opposite York City Rowing Club between Lendal Bridge and the Scarborough Railway Bridge next to the Museum Gardens. Boathouse and facilities The club's boathouse sits on 21 km of row-able water, on the River Ouse; it is approximately 12 km downstream from 'The Split' (where the Nidd and Ouse meet, but where on approaching from York the rivers 'split') and 9 km upstream from Naburn Lock. The stone and concrete boathouse nestles into land adjacent to the Museum Gardens. The building replaced the wooden boathouse at the bottom of Marygate in York during an early heyday for the club in the 1960s at the request of the then St John's College Principal, Canon Lamb, by the George Pace firm of architects, who also refurbished the College Chapel and built a new Chapel in 1966. Racing The club competes at a number of regattas and head races throughout the academic year (September - August). Prior to Christmas the club's main focus is BUCS competition and the York Small Boats Head. These events provide developing crews with the academic year's first taste of inter-university competition and the beginner crews with the first chance to apply what they have learnt in race conditions. The club also sends its athletes to the National Indoor Rowing Championships. After Christmas, the club enters a number of events during the continuing head season. These include Durham Small Boats Head and a Varsity match against the University of York Boat Club. From 2010 the club has entered the women's and men's Head of the River Races too. Following further training in the Easter vacation the summer sees attendance at the York Spring Regatta, the BUCS Regatta and other regional regattas such as Doncaster, Durham, Bradford, Tees and York Summer.

The BDA governs the sport through its Executive Committee and Council. The BDA Executive Committee is responsible for the policy, organisation and administration of the sport, at UK level, and for the selection of British crews competing abroad. As a National Governing Body, the BDA is a member of both the International Dragon Boat Federation (IDBF) International Dragon Boat Federation and the European Dragon Boat Federation (EDBF).European Dragon Boat Federation and is a Founding Member of both federations.  History  Dragon Boat Racing first featured competitively in the UK in September 1980 at the Hong Kong in London Chinese Festival. Races held on the River Thames were won by the Richmond Canoe Club in both the Men's and Women's classes. In 1981 racing featured in the World Canoe and Kayak Racing Championships, organised by Mike MacKeddie-Haslam and held at the National Water Sports Centre, Nottingham. The Lincoln Imps crew won this 500-metre event. The formation of the DBRC (Dragon Boat Racing Club of Great Britain) in June 1985, by Mike MacKeddie-Haslam, was the first serious attempt to organise the sport on a national scale in the British Isles. With the three Hong Kong wooden boats imported for the London Festival in 1980, the DBRC raced fairly regularly during 1986/87, and with the support of the HKTA, built the first fibre-glass dragon boat in the country. After making its debut on the BBC TV's 'Blue Peter' programme, in May 1986 a dragon boat was raced from London to Nottingham via the canal system by a crew of soldiers in aid of charity. The crew paddled 180 miles (including 180 portages for canal locks) in 9 days and raised over ¬£4,000 for Sport Aid en route. In 1986 and early 1987 specialist dragon boat groups were formed in Sheffield, Liverpool and Tyneside (although none of them had dragon boats, at this stage). In July 1987, following an initiative by the DBRC, these groups came together to form the British Dragon Boat Racing Association ‚Äì the BDA, which was formally constituted as the governing body for the sport of Dragon Boat Racing in the UK at an inaugural meeting held at the National Water Sports Centre, Nottingham. Mike MacKeddie- Haslam was elected as the first BDA Chairman. The 1st National Championships were held in October 1987 on the Serpentine Lake in London's Hyde Park, where 19 crews contested the 500m races. Elmbridge Kayak Club were the first BDA National Champions over this distance.

The duo won 2nd place in the M-1 Grand Prix 2008 competition. As of February 2009, the duo belongs to the management company K Dash Stage Co., Ltd.  Biography  Formed under the name of in 2000, Kasuga initially was the tsukkomi (\\"straight man\\") and Wakabayashi the boke (\\"funny man\\"). After almost 6 years of unsuccessful activities, Wakabayashi was one day told by a TV playwright in person that his mate, Kasuga, is as a tsukkomi, and that he had \\"better look for another mate\\". When Wakabayashi tried to explain to Kasuga what he had been told, Kasuga \\"thought he was just joking.\\" Rejecting the idea but swapping their roles instead, they finally started to make first appearances on terrestrial TV broadcasts in 2008. On December 21, 2008, the two made it all the way to the final round of the M-1 Grand Prix of the year from the consolation. After the first session of the final, competed and broadcast live on the same day, they were temporarily in the top position ahead of the other eight duos, but ended up 2nd overall behind NON STYLE. The manzai performed by Audrey is characterized by Kasuga's trying to shoot tsukkomi but each time turning out to be terribly off-the-line boke, interrupting Wakabayashi's talks with delayed responses and frequent gags. Wakabayashi, on the other hand, either reacts fast and hard with his tsukkomi in return, or sometimes just \\"ignores\\" him. In 2009, they were on TV commercials for major global companies such as Toyota Motor, Nintendo and KFC.

He was consul in 11 BC as the colleague of Quintus Aelius Tubero,Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 457. and a confidant of emperor Augustus. Background The patrician Fabii were one of the most ancient and illustrious families of Rome, but by the Late Republic their status had begun to wane. Ronald Syme notes that the Fabii had \\"missed a generation in the consulate.\\"Syme, The Roman Revolution (Oxford: University Press, 1939), p. 18 Fabius was the elder son of Quintus Fabius Maximus, one of Caesar's legates during the Civil War, whom Caesar appointed consul suffectus on October 1, 45 BC.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 403. He was named after his ancestor, Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, pp. 75, 419, 420. The elder Fabius died on the last day of his consulship, December 31, leaving Paullus, his younger brother, Africanus Fabius Maximus, and a sister, Fabia Paullina. Political career Fabius' first known post was that of quaestor, in which capacity he served under Augustus during the emperor's travels through the eastern provinces from 22 to 19 BC.IG II2. 4130; Athens After his consulship, Fabius served as proconsul of Asia; the exact period of his administration is uncertain, with some sources favouring 10 to 8 BC,Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 405.K. M. T. Atkinson, \\"The Governors of the Province Asia in the Reign of Augustus\\", Historia 7 (1958), pp. 300‚Äì330. and others as 6 to 5.B. A. Buxton & R.

During this time, he minted a number of coins bearing his image.Jocelyn Toynbee, Roman Historical Portraits (1978), pp. 74 ff. In 3 BC, Fabius was legatus or governor of Hispania Tarraconensis.ILS 8895; Bracara; Bracara; Lucus Augusti; Lucus AugustiSyme, Augustan Aristocracy, pp. 407, 408. While there, Paullus captured a Celtic city and named it Lucus Augusti, the modern city of Lugo.noted as by Ptolemy, ii. 6. ¬ß 24 During Fabius' administration of Asia, the provincial council decreed a competition to find a unique honour for the emperor. The winner was to receive a crown from the province. The proconsul himself submitted the winning proposal: a new calendar for the province, wherein the new year would start on September 23, Augustus' birthday.Steven J. Friesen, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John (2001), pp. 32-5 He was honored with a monument built by some grateful colonists in his memory on the top of the sacred hill of Monte Giove, in the territory of Hatria Picena, where there was a sanctuary. Personal life At some time between 20 and 10 BC, Fabius married Marcia, daughter of Lucius Marcius Philippus, consul suffectus in 38 BC. Her mother, Atia, was an aunt of Augustus, making Marcia the emperor's cousin.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy (1989), pp. 153, 403.ILS 8811; Paphos They had at least one son, Paullus Fabius Persicus, who was probably born in 2 or 1 BC. The younger Fabius was consul in AD 34, with Lucius Vitellius, father of the emperor Aulus Vitellius.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 416. The elder Fabius and Marcia may also have been the parents of Fabia Numantina, although she may have been the daughter of Paullus' brother, Africanus.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, pp. 417, 418. Fabius was a member of the Arval Brethren, an ancient college of priests that had dwindled into obscurity before Augustus chose to revive its importance as a means of demonstrating his piety and devotion to Roman traditions. = ILS 5026; Rome Fabius was later succeeded in this priestly office by his son.; Rome The poet Juvenal described Fabius as a generous patron of poetry.Juvenal, Satires vii. 95. He was named in one of Horace's poems, written in 13 BC, and one of Horace's odes hints at him.Horace, Odes iv. 1. Fabius was also the recipient of a wedding song composed by Ovid.Ovid, Epistulae ex Ponto i. 2. ¬ß 131. While in exile Ovid wrote to Paullus, soliciting his help in allowing Ovid to return.Ovid, Epistulae ex Ponto i. 2; iii. 1. Writing many years later, the historian Tacitus reported that Fabius had accompanied the emperor on a secret visit to the emperor's last surviving grandson, Agrippa Postumus, in AD 13. Postumus had been exiled in AD 9, perhaps at the instigation of his stepmother, the empress Livia Drusilla. According to Tacitus, Augustus and his grandson were reconciled, although the latter was not recalled from exile before the emperor's death in AD 14. Supposedly, Fabius discussed the visit with his wife, who informed the empress. Tacitus reported that Fabius' death in the summer of AD 14 was said to be either directly or indirectly the result of Augustus' anger at this betrayal of trust.Tacitus, Annals i. 5. However, both the truth and accuracy of this story have been questioned by modern historians.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 414.Ovid, Epistulae ex Ponto iv. 6.
