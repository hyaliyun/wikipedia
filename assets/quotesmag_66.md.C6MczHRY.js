Ralstonia is a genus of Proteobacteria, previously included in the genus Pseudomonas. It is named after the American bacteriologist Ericka Ralston. Ericka Ralston was born Ericka Barrett in 1944 in Saratoga, California, and died in 2015 in Sebastopol, California. While in graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, she identified 20 strains of Pseudomonas which formed a phenotypical homologous group, and named them Pseudomonas pickettii, after M.J. Pickett in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of California at Los Angeles, from whom she had received the strains. Later, P. pickettii was transferred to the new genus Ralstonia, along with several other species. She continued her research into bacterial pathogenesis under the name of Ericka Barrett while a professor of microbiology at the University of California at Davis from 1977 until her retirement in 1996. Genomics *Ralstonia Genome Projects (from Genomes OnLine Database) *Comparative Analysis of Ralstonia Genomes (at DOE's IMG system) Ralstonia has also been identified as a common contaminant of DNA extraction kit or PCR reagents, which may lead to its erroneous appearance in microbiota or metagenomic datasets. Ralstonia is one of the most common pathogens for causing nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients. Those receiving mechanical ventilation are twelve times more likely of developing the infection than those not on a mechanical vent.

Seiter and starring Lawrence Gray, O. P. Heggie, and Inez Courtney. It was produced and released by First National Pictures. The film was based on the Broadway stage hit, Sunny, produced by Charles Dillingham, which played from September 22, 1925, to December 11, 1926. Marilyn Miller, who had played the leading part in the Broadway production, was hired by Warner Brothers to reprise the role that made her the highest-paid star on Broadway. The AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893-1993: Sunny Plot Marylin Miller plays the part of an American circus performer, doing her act in a British circus, who is engaged to a man she does not love. A former boyfriend, played by Lawrence Gray, stops by to see her before taking a boat back to the United States. Miller realizing that she loves Gray, decides to run away. She embarks on the same boat that Lawrence takes. Her father, who realizes what his daughter has done, reaches the boat just as it is about to leave and manages to board it. While on board, Gray becomes engaged to be married to a wealthy socialite (Barbara Bedford). Miller learns that she will not be allowed to disembark in the United States without a passport. In order to land, Miller marries an American friend, intending to divorce him as soon as she is safely inside the United States. After arriving in the States, Miller tells Gray about her love for him. Bedford overhears them and tells Gray that she will announce their engagement at a party that very night. Disappointed, Miller decides to return to England, but Gray proposes to her just as she is about to leave.

The film was completed as a full musical. Due to the backlash against musicals, however, the Warner Bros. were forced to make many cuts to the film and much of the original music is missing or severely truncated. The film had originally been announced as a Technicolor production in trade journals. This was dropped once the studio realized that the public was growing weary of musicals. The film was released as a full musical outside of the United States, where a backlash against musicals never occurred. It is not known whether a print of this longer version still exists.

The effect is named after Robin Hood, said to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor. Causes of a Robin Hood effect A Robin Hood effect can be caused by a large number of different policies or economic decisions, not all of which are specifically aimed at reducing inequality. This article lists only some of these. Natural national development A Kuznets curve Simon Kuznets argued that one major factor behind levels of economic inequality is the stage of economic development of a country. Kuznets described a curve-like relationship between level of income and inequality, as shown. That theory prescribes that countries with very low levels of development will have relatively equal distributions of wealth. As a country develops, it necessarily acquires more capital, and the owners of this capital will then have more wealth and income, which introduces inequality. However, eventually various possible redistribution mechanisms such as trickle down effects and social welfare programs will lead to a Robin Hood effect, with wealth redistributed to the poor. Therefore, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality. Non-proportional income tax Many countries have an income tax system where the first part of a worker's salary is taxed very little or not at all, while those on higher salaries must pay a higher tax rate on earnings over a certain threshold, known as progressive taxation. This has the effect of the better-off population paying a higher proportion of their salary in tax, effectively subsidising the less-well off, leading to a Robin Hood effect. Specifically, a progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases.Webster (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)American Heritage (6). Increasing in rate as the taxable amount increases.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia: Tax levied at a rate that increases as the quantity subject to taxation increases.Princeton University WordNet: (n) progressive tax (any tax in which the rate increases as the amount subject to taxation increases)Sommerfeld, Ray M., Silvia A. Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), Concepts of Taxation, Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX \\"Progressive\\" describes a distribution effect on income or expenditure, referring to the way the rate progresses from low to high, where the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate.Hyman, David M. (1990) Public Finance: A Contemporary Application of Theory to Policy, 3rd, Dryden Press: Chicago, ILJames, Simon (1998) A Dictionary of Taxation, Edgar Elgar Publishing Limited: Northampton, MA It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower ability-to-pay, as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay. Cross-subsidisation of mobile telephony In many developing countries, mobile communications networks tend to experience a large network externality, which regulators and operators seek to correct by subsidising subscriptions through increased prices for call termination. That then allows the less-well off in that country to gain access to communications services, often for free (on a prepay tariff). The additional cost is then levied on subscribers who make calls to these new subscribers; the call originators tend to be better- off. Therefore, despite there being no direct transfer of money, there is a strong Robin Hood effect, with the better-off subsidising the less well-off.

R. solanacearum is soil-borne and motile with a polar flagellar tuft. It colonises the xylem, causing bacterial wilt in a very wide range of potential host plants. It is known as Granville wilt when it occurs in tobacco. Bacterial wilts of tomato, pepper, eggplant, and Irish potato caused by R. solanacearum were among the first diseases that Erwin Frink Smith proved to be caused by a bacterial pathogen. Because of its devastating lethality, R. solanacearum is now one of the more intensively studied phytopathogenic bacteria, and bacterial wilt of tomato is a model system for investigating mechanisms of pathogenesis. Ralstonia was recently reclassified as Pseudomonas, with similarity in most aspects, except that it does not produce fluorescent pigment like Pseudomonas.Agrios, G. N. (2008). Plant pathology. Amsterdam [u.a.], Elsevier Academic Press, pp 647-649 The genomes from different strains vary from 5.5 Mb up to 6 Mb, roughly being 3.5 Mb of a chromosome and 2 Mb of a megaplasmid. While the strain GMI1000 was one of the first phytopathogenic bacterias to have its genome completed, the strain UY031 was the first R. solanacearum to have its methylome reported. Within the R. solanacearum species complex, the four major monophyletic clusters of strains are termed phylotypes, that are geographically distinct: phylotypes I-IV are found in Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania, respectively. Ralstonia solanacearum was once considered as a possible biological control agent for Kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), a highly invasive species. However, R. solanacearum is no longer used as a biological control for Kahili ginger in Hawaiian forests because of its wide host range. The ginger-parasitizing strain will infect numerous ginger species, including edible ginger (Zingiber officinale), shampoo ginger (Zingiber zerumbet, pink ginger (Alpinia purpurata), and red ginger (Alpinia purpurata). Hosts and symptoms Photograph of tomato plant with Ralstonia wilt symptoms, Clemson University - USDA Cooperative Extension Slide Series Hosts Plant hosts that R. solanacearum infects include: ;Crops: *Potato (Solanum tuberosum); tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum); aubergine (egg plant) (Solanum melongena); banana, (Musa spp); geranium (common name) (Pelargonium); ginger (Zingiber officinale); tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum); sweet pepper (Capsicum spp.); olive (Olea europea); rose (Rosa); and soybean (Glycine max). ;Wild hosts: *Woody nightshade (Solanum dulcamara) Symptoms Geranium: *Wilting begins with lower leaves and petioles and works its way up the plant. *Wilted leaves have chlorotic, wedge-shaped areas or chlorotic and/or necrotic leaf margins. No leaf spots are evident. *Eventually, the entire plant collapses on the medium. *White runny material oozes from cut stems. Potato: *Wilting of the leaves occurs at the end of the day with recovery at night. Plants eventually fail to recover and die. *Brown staining of vascular ring happens and pus may exude from the ring when the tuber is squeezed. *Pale ooze may exude from eyes and heel end of potato. Soil will adhere to the oozing eyes. *Cross-section of a stem placed in water will exude milky white strands. *Unlike the fungal wilts, the leaves remains green in bacterial wilt. Disease cycle=Survival Ralstonia solanacearum can overwinter in plant debris or diseased plants, wild hosts, seeds, or vegetative propagative organs like tubers. The bacteria can survive for a long time in water (up to 40 years at 20‚Äì25 ¬∞C in pure water), and the bacterial population is reduced in extreme conditions (temperature, pH, salts, e.g.). Infected land sometimes cannot be used again for susceptible crops for several years. R. solanacearum can also survive in cool weather and enter a state of being viable but not culturable. In most cases, this stage is not an agricultural threat because the bacteria usually become avirulent after recovering.Denny T., \\"Plant Pathogenic Ralstonia species\\" in GNANAMANICKAM, S. S. (2006). Plant-associated bacteria. Dordrecht, Springer. pp 1-62 Dispersal Ralstonia solanacearum causes wilting at high populations (108 ‚Äì 1010 cfu/g tissue) and disperses in several routes. The large number of R. solanacearum can shed from roots of symptomatic and nonsymptomatic plants. Besides that, bacterial ooze (which is usually used as a sign for detection) on plant surfaces) can enter the surrounding soil or water, contaminating farming equipment or may be acquired by insect vectors. In addition, this pathogen can be spread by contaminated flood water, irrigation, contaminated tools, or infected seeds. In northern Europe, the pathogen has become established in solanaceous weeds which grow in slow-moving rivers. When such contaminated water is used to irrigate potatoes, the pathogen enters the potato production system. The race 3 biovar 2 strain can survive in perennial nightshades which act as secondary hosts, and can also cause bacterial wilt of tomato. Some EU states and Middle Eastern countries have not yet been able to eradicate this pathogen. Infection Ralstonia solanacearum usually enters the plant by a wound. Natural wounds (created by abscission of flowers, genesis of lateral roots) and unnatural ones (by agricultural practices or nematodes and xylem-feeding insects) could become entry sites for R. solanacearum. The bacteria get access to the wounds partially by flagellar- mediated swimming motility and chemotaxic attraction toward root exudates. Unlike many phytopathogenic bacteria, R. solanacearum potentially requires only one entry site to establish a systemic infection that results in bacterial wilt. After invading a susceptible host, R. solanacearum multiplies and moves systemically within the plant before bacterial wilt symptoms occur. Wilting should be considered as the most visible side effect that usually occurs after extensive colonization of the pathogen. When the pathogen gets into the xylem through natural openings or wounds, tyloses may form to block the axial migration of bacteria within the plant. In susceptible plants, this sometimes happens slowly and infrequently to prevent pathogen migration, and may instead lead to vascular dysfunction by unspecifically obstructing uncolonized vessels. Wilting occurs at high bacterial populations in the xylem and is partially due to vascular dysfunction in which sufficient water cannot reach the leaves. At this time, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS1) content is about 10 Œºg/g tissue in the taproot, hypocotyl, and midstem; EPS1 concentration is higher later on at more than 100 Œºg/g tissue in fully wilted plant. Ralstonia's systemic toxin also causes loss of stomatal control, but no evidence shows excessive transpiration as its consequence. The primary factor contributing to wilting is probably blocking of pit membranes in the petioles and leaves by the high molecular weight EPS1. High bacterial densities are byproducts of plant cell wall degradation; tyloses and gums produced by the plant itself are other contributing factors to wilting. Natural genetic transformation Most strains of R. solanacearum are competent for genetic transformation. Natural genetic transformation is a sexual process involving DNA transfer from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination. R. solanacearum is able to exchange large DNA fragments ranging from 30 to 90 thousand bases. Virulence mechanisms Ralstonia solanacearum possesses genes for all six protein secretion pathways that have been characterized in Gram-negative bacteria. Perhaps the best- studied of these is the Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS), which secretes infection-promoting effector proteins (T3Es) into host cells. Around 74 suspected or confirmed T3Es have been identified in R. solanacearum to date, although the functions of very few are currently known. Despite being just one of several protein secretion systems, T3SS is necessary for R. solanacearum to cause disease. No single effector protein has been found to significantly alter pathogenicity of R. solanacearum, but simultaneous disruption of certain subsets of effectors (such as the set of seven GALA effectors in strain GMI1000) strongly affects virulence of the pathogen. GALA 7 is necessary for virulence on Medicago truncatula, hinting that T3E diversity may play a role in determining the broad host range of the R. solanacearum species complex. The type III secretion system is not unique to R. solanacearum, and is, in fact, very ancient. The evolutionary history of the T3SS is contested; a high degree of similarity to the flagellum has sparked debate over the relationship between these two structures. About half of T3SS proteins are highly conserved in R. solanacearum and likely constitute a very old and stabilized effector core. Among the other half showing variation among different strains of R. solanacearum, only a third show evidence of lateral gene transfer. The origins of the remaining effectors are unknown, although some researchers hypothesize that gene-for-gene interactions may play a significant role in shaping virulence genes in R. solanacearum. Some of these effector proteins are homologous to Transcription Activator-like effectors (TAL effectors) from Xanthomonas and could possibly have a similar function of activating specific genes in the host plant cells during R. solanacearum pathogenesis. Environment The environment in which R. solanacearum is commonly found is affected by the particular race (a genetically diverse population within a species), and the particular biovar (a strain that differs physiologically or biochemically from other strains.) Race 1, race 2 biovar 1, and race 3, biovar 2 are three of the most common and important strains. Race 1 strains have a broad host range including tobacco and bananas, and are usually found in tropical and subtropical environments, as they have trouble surviving cooler temperatures, and are endemic to the southeastern United States. Race 2 strains have a more limited host range than race 1, and are mostly restricted to tropical environments. Race 3 strains are more cold tolerant than the other two and are found in tropical highlands and temperate areas. The host range for race 3 biovar 2 includes potatoes, tomatoes, and geraniums. Race 3 biovar 2 is very common throughout the world, but is not generally reported in North America, so is the focus of many sanitation and quarantine management practices to prevent the introduction or spread of the pathogen. Management=General management Commercial chemicals have generally proven to be ineffective in controlling the pathogen and are not recommended as a means of control. In regions where the pathogen is established, a strategy of integrated disease management is the best method to reduce any impact of the pathogen. Using pathogen-free planting materials is a necessity. Planting resistant cultivars minimizes the ill effects of the pathogen, although no completely immune cultivars are now available. Finally, a good rotation system that follows susceptible crops with resistant or nonhost crops can assist in diminishing the pathogen. The pathogen is listed as a select agent in the United States; if the pathogen is detected by a proper authority, a number of management protocols may be implemented. These can range from surveys to quarantines of infected and potentially infected plant material, which in turn may lead to larger eradication and sanitation programs. Specific host plant symptoms and managementPotato Wilting and yellowing of the leaves, as well as overall stunting of the plant, are typical symptoms. The leaves may also take on a bronze cast along with stems becoming streaked and tuber eyes becoming discolored. Tubers also start to rot if left in the ground. A milky-white sticky exudate or ooze, consisting of bacterial cells and their extracellular polysaccharide, is usually noticeable in freshly cut-sections of infected tubers. Control of R. solanacearum is difficult because it is a soil borne pathogen, has wide host range, long survival in the soil, and has wide biological variation. No single control method has been found to be 100% effective, although in locations where the pathogen is established, some level of bacterial wilt control has been possible through use of a combination of diverse methods. These methods include phytosanitation and cultural practices, chemical control, biological control, and host resistance. General sanitation practices are recommended to prevent spread of the disease, as chemical control is ineffective. Crop rotation with resistant crops is useful, as is altering the pH of the soil to keep it low in the summer (4-5), and higher in the fall (6.) Tomato Younger leaves of the plant will become flaccid, and adventitious roots may appear on the stem of the plant. The vascular system exhibits a progressively darker brown color as the disease progresses, in addition to possible lesions on the stem. Management practices are similar to those of potato. Banana Typically, yellowing and wilting of older leaves occurs, as well as reduced fruit size and eventual rotting of the fruit. In addition, flowers can become blackened and shriveled, and the vascular tissue discolored.http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/pw/ph/dis/fn/fs2006_moko_neyres.pdf Exclusion of the disease where it is not present is the only effective means of control. If an area does become infected, all of the infected plants must be eliminated, which is why strong sanitation practices must be used to reduce the spread of disease. Importance Ralstonia solanacearum is classified as one of the world's most important phytopathogenic bacteria due to its lethality, persistence, wide host range, and broad geographic distribution. Although the pathogen causes major yield losses in the tropics and subtropics, it is currently a continuing threat in temperate climates. Ralstonia solanacearum is a high-profile alien plant pathogen of A2 quarantine status affecting a very wide range of crops. This means that it is present in parts of Europe, but is under statutory control. Worldwide, the most important crops affected are: potato, tomato, tobacco, banana, and geranium. In the UK and the rest of the EU, the most important crops affected are potato and tomato. It would cause serious economic damage were it to become more established than it currently is. Losses are due to actual yield reduction and also due to statutory measures taken to eliminate the disease. Bacterial wilt caused by R. solanacearum is of economic importance because it infects over 250 plant species in over 50 families. As of 2007, this pathogen has affected over 450 host species representing 54 plant families due to its broad host range around the world. The disease is known as southern wilt, bacterial wilt, and brown rot of potato. Many more dicots suffer from the disease than do monocots. Among the monocot hosts, the order Zingiberales dominates, with five of nine families being infected by this bacterium. The reason why some families are more susceptible to bacterial wilt is still unknown. Originally, R. solanacearum is found in tropical, subtropical, and warm, temperate climates, but is not believed to survive cold temperatures. However, this pathogen has recently been detected in geraniums (Pelargonium spp.) in Wisconsin, USA Hudelson B. 2005.

American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN. Race 3 biovar 2 is cold tolerant and classified as a quarantine pathogen. In addition, this race/biovar has been listed as a select agent in the Agricultural Bioterrorism Act of 2002, and is considered to have potential to be developed as a bioterror weapon.

In conventional single-stream beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate weighting (phase and gain) such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver output. When the receiver has multiple antennas, single-stream beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas.G.J. Foschini and M.J. Gans, On limits of wireless communications in a fading environment when using multiple antennas, Wireless Personal Communications, vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 311‚Äì335, 1998. In order to maximize the throughput in multiple receive antenna systems, multi-stream transmission is generally required. In point-to-point systems, precoding means that multiple data streams are emitted from the transmit antennas with independent and appropriate weightings such that the link throughput is maximized at the receiver output. In multi-user MIMO, the data streams are intended for different users (known as SDMA) and some measure of the total throughput (e.g., the sum performance or max-min fairness) is maximized. In point-to-point systems, some of the benefits of precoding can be realized without requiring channel state information at the transmitter, while such information is essential to handle the inter-user interference in multi- user systems.D. Gesbert, M. Kountouris, R.W. Heath Jr., C.-B. Chae, and T. S√§lzer, Shifting the MIMO Paradigm, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, vol. 24, no. 5, pp. 36-46, 2007. Precoding in the downlink of cellular networks, known as network MIMO or coordinated multipoint (CoMP), is a generalized form of multi-user MIMO that can be analyzed by the same mathematical techniques.E. Bj√∂rnson and E. Jorswieck, Optimal Resource Allocation in Coordinated Multi- Cell Systems, Foundations and Trends in Communications and Information Theory, vol. 9, no. 2-3, pp. 113-381, 2013. Precoding in Simple Words  Precoding is a technique that exploits transmit diversity by weighting the information stream, i.e. the transmitter sends the coded information to the receiver to achieve pre-knowledge of the channel. The receiver is a simple detector, such as a matched filter, and does not have to know the channel state information. This technique will reduce the corrupted effect of the communication channel. For example you are sending the information s and it will pass through the channel, h, and add Gaussian noise, n. The received signal at the receiver front-end will be r = sh + n; The receiver will have to know the information about h and n. It will suppress the effect of n by increasing SNR, but what about h? It needs information about the channel, h, and this will increase the complexity. The receiver (mobile units) has to be simple for many reasons like cost or size of mobile unit. So, the transmitter (the base station) will do the hard work and predict the channel. Let us call the predicted channel h_{\\\\text{est}} and for a system with precoder the information will be coded: {s \\\\over h_{\\\\text{est}}}. The received signal will be r = \\\\left(\\\\frac{h}{h_{\\\\text{est}}}\\\\right) s + n. If your prediction is perfect, h_{\\\\text{est}} = h and r = s + n and it turns out to be the detection problem in Gaussian channels which is simple. To prevent a potential misunderstanding here, precoding does not cancel out the impact of the channel, but it aligns the vector containing the transmit symbols (i.e. transmit vector) with the eigenvector(s) of the channel. In simple terms, it transforms the transmit symbols' vector in such a way that the vector reaches the receiver in the strongest form that is possible in the given channel. Why do they call it \\"coding\\"? It is a preprocessing technique that performs transmit diversity and it is similar to equalization, but the main difference is that you have to optimize the precoder with a decoder. Channel equalization aims to minimize channel errors, but the precoder aims to minimize the error in the receiver output.http://www.edaboard.com/thread130479.html Precoding for Point-to- Point MIMO Systems  In point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, a transmitter equipped with multiple antennas communicates with a receiver that has multiple antennas. Most classic precoding results assume narrowband, slowly fading channels, meaning that the channel for a certain period of time can be described by a single channel matrix which does not change faster. In practice, such channels can be achieved, for example, through OFDM. The precoding strategy that maximizes the throughput, called channel capacity, depends on the channel state information available in the system. Statistical channel state information If the receiver knows the channel matrix and the transmitter has statistical information, eigenbeamforming is known to achieve the MIMO channel capacity.D. Love, R. Heath, V. Lau, D. Gesbert, B. Rao and M. Andrews, An overview of limited feedback in wireless communication systems, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas Communications, vol. 26, no. 8, pp. 1341‚Äì1365, 2008. In this approach, the transmitter emits multiple streams in eigendirections of the channel covariance matrix. Full channel state information If the channel matrix is completely known, singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding is known to achieve the MIMO channel capacity.E. Telatar, Capacity of multiantenna Gaussian channels , European Transactions on Telecommunications, vol. 10, no. 6, pp. 585-595, 1999. In this approach, the channel matrix is diagonalized by taking an SVD and removing the two unitary matrices through pre- and post- multiplication at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Then, one data stream per singular value can be transmitted (with appropriate power loading) without creating any interference whatsoever. Precoding for Multi-user MIMO Systems In multi-user MIMO, a multi-antenna transmitter communicates simultaneously with multiple receivers (each having one or multiple antennas). This is known as space-division multiple access (SDMA). From an implementation perspective, precoding algorithms for SDMA systems can be sub-divided into linear and nonlinear precoding types. The capacity achieving algorithms are nonlinear,H. Weingarten, Y. Steinberg, and S. Shamai, The capacity region of the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel , IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 52, no. 9, pp. 3936‚Äì3964, 2006. but linear precoding approaches usually achieve reasonable performance with much lower complexity. Linear precoding strategies include maximum ratio transmission (MRT),T. Lo, Maximum ratio transmission, IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 47, no. 10, pp. 1458‚Äì1461, 1999. zero-forcing (ZF) precoding,M. Joham, W. Utschick, and J. Nossek, Linear transmit processing in MIMO communications systems, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 53, no. 8, pp. 2700‚Äì2712, 2005. and transmit Wiener precoding There are also precoding strategies tailored for low-rate feedback of channel state information, for example random beamforming.M. Sharif and B. Hassibi, On the Capacity of MIMO Broadcast Channels With Partial Side Information, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 51, no. 2, pp. 506-522, 2005. Nonlinear precoding is designed based on the concept of dirty paper coding (DPC), which shows that any known interference at the transmitter can be subtracted without the penalty of radio resources if the optimal precoding scheme can be applied on the transmit signal. While performance maximization has a clear interpretation in point-to-point MIMO, a multi-user system cannot simultaneously maximize the performance for all users. This can be viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem where each objective corresponds to maximization of the capacity of one of the users. The usual way to simplify this problem is to select a system utility function; for example, the weighted sum capacity where the weights correspond to the system's subjective user priorities. Furthermore, there might be more users than data streams, requiring a scheduling algorithm to decide which users to serve at a given time instant. Linear precoding with full channel state information This suboptimal approach cannot achieve the weighted sum rate, but it can still maximize the weighted sum performance (or some other metric of achievable rates under linear precoding). The optimal linear precoding does not have any closed-form expression, but it takes the form of a weighted MMSE precoding for single-antenna receivers. The precoding weights for a given user are selected to maximize a ratio between the signal gain at this user and the interference generated at other users (with some weights) plus noise. Thus, precoding can be interpreted as finding the optimal balance between achieving strong signal gain and limiting inter-user interference.E. Bj√∂rnson, R. Zakhour, D. Gesbert, B. Ottersten, Cooperative Multicell Precoding: Rate Region Characterization and Distributed Strategies with Instantaneous and Statistical CSI, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 58, no. 8, pp. 4298-4310, 2010. Finding the optimal weighted MMSE precoding is difficult, leading to approximate approaches where the weights are selected heuristically. A common approach is to concentrate on either the numerator or the denominator of the mentioned ratio; that is, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF)N. Jindal, MIMO Broadcast Channels with Finite Rate Feedback, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 52, no. 11, pp. 5045‚Äì5059, 2006. precoding. MRT only maximizes the signal gain at the intended user. MRT is close-to-optimal in noise-limited systems, where the inter-user interference is negligible compared to the noise. ZF precoding aims at nulling the inter- user interference, at the expense of losing some signal gain. ZF precoding can achieve a performance close to the sum capacity when the number of users is large or the system is interference-limited (i.e., the noise is weak compared to the interference). A balance between MRT and ZF is obtained by the so- called regularized zero-forcingB. C. B. Peel, B. M. Hochwald, and A. L.

Also for multiuser MIMO system setup, another approach has been used to reformulate the weighted sum rate optimization problem to a weighted sum MSE problem with additional optimization MSE weights for each symbol in.T.

Note that the optimal linear precoding can be computed using monotonic optimization algorithms,W. Utschick and J.

Ottersten, Robust monotonic optimization framework for multicell MISO systems, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 60, no. 5, pp. 2508‚Äì2523, 2012. but the computational complexity scales exponentially fast with the number of users. These algorithms are therefore only useful for benchmarking in small systems. Linear precoding with limited channel state information In practice, the channel state information is limited at the transmitter due to estimation errors and quantization. Inaccurate channel knowledge may result in significant loss of system throughput, as the interference between the multiplexed streams cannot be completely controlled. In closed-loop systems, the feedback capabilities decide which precoding strategies that are feasible. Each receiver can either feedback a quantized version of its complete channel knowledge or focus on certain critical performance indicators (e.g., the channel gain). If the complete channel knowledge is fed back with good accuracy, then one can use strategies designed for having full channel knowledge with minor performance degradation. Zero-forcing precoding may even achieve the full multiplexing gain, but only provided that the accuracy of the channel feedback increases linearly with signal-to-noise ratio (in dB). Quantization and feedback of channel state information is based on vector quantization, and codebooks based on Grassmannian line packing have shown good performance.D.J. Love, R.W. Heath, and T. Strohmer, Grassmannian Beamforming for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Wireless Systems, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 49, no. 10, pp. 2735‚Äì2747, 2003. Other precoding strategies have been developed for the case with very low channel feedback rates. Random beamforming (or opportunistic beamformingP. Viswanath, D. N. C. Tse, Member, and R. Laroia, Opportunistic Beamforming Using Dumb Antennas, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 48, no. 6, pp. 1277‚Äì1294, 2002.) was proposed as a simple way of achieving good performance that scales like the sum capacity when the number of receivers is large. In this suboptimal strategy, a set of beamforming directions are selected randomly and users feed back a few bits to tell the transmitter which beam gives the best performance and what rate they can support using it. When the number of users is large, it is likely that each random beamforming weight will provide good performance for some user. In spatially correlated environments, the long-term channel statistics can be combined with low-rate feedback to perform multi-user precoding.D. Hammarwall, M. Bengtsson, and B. Ottersten, Utilizing the spatial information provided by channel norm feedback in SDMA systems, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 56, no. 7, pp. 3278‚Äì3293, 2008 As spatially correlated statistics contain much directional information, it is only necessary for users to feed back their current channel gain to achieve reasonable channel knowledge. As the beamforming weights are selected from the statistics, and not randomly, this approach outperforms random beamforming under strong spatial correlation.E. Bj√∂rnson, D. Hammarwall, B. Ottersten, Exploiting Quantized Channel Norm Feedback through Conditional Statistics in Arbitrarily Correlated MIMO Systems, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 57, no. 10, pp. 4027-4041, 2009 In multiuser MIMO systems where the number of users are higher than the number of transmit antennas, a multiuser diversity can be achieved by performing user scheduling before applying zero- forcing beamforming. Multiuser diversity is a form of selection diversity among users, the base station can schedule its transmission to those users with favorable channel fading conditions to improve the system throughput. In order to achieve multiuser diversity and apply zero-forcing precoding, the CSI of all users are required at the base station. However, the amount of overall feedback information increases with the number of users. Therefore, it is important to perform a user selection at the receiver to determine the users which feed back their quantized CSI to the transmitter based on a pre-defined threshold. B. √ñzbek, D.

Description of Multi-user MIMO Consider a downlink multi-user MIMO system where a base station with N transmit antennas and K single-antenna users. The channel to user k is described by the N \\\\times 1 vector \\\\mathbf{h}_k of channel coefficients and its ith element describes the channel response between the ith transmit antenna and the receive antenna. The input-output relationship can be described as :y_k = \\\\mathbf{h}_k^H \\\\mathbf{x}+n_k, \\\\quad k=1,2, \\\\ldots, K where \\\\mathbf{x} is the N \\\\times 1 transmitted vector signal, y_k is the received signal, and n_k is the zero-mean unit-variance noise. Under linear precoding, the transmitted vector signal is :\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\mathbf{w}_i s_i, where s_i is the (normalized) data symbol and \\\\mathbf{w}_i is the N \\\\times 1 linear precoding vector. The signal-to-interference-and- noise ratio (SINR) at user k becomes :\\\\textrm{SINR}_k = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{h}_k^H\\\\mathbf{w}_k^2}{\\\\sigma_k^2+\\\\sum_{i eq k} \\\\mathbf{h}_k^H\\\\mathbf{w}_i^2} where \\\\sigma_k^2 is the noise variance for channel to user k and the corresponding achievable information rate is \\\\log_2(1+\\\\textrm{SINR}_k) bits per channel use. The transmission is limited by power constraints. This can, for example, be a total power constraint \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\\\\\mathbf{w}_i\\\\^2 \\\\leq P where P is the power limit. A common performance metric in multi-user systems is the weighted sum rate :\\\\underset{\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{w}_k\\\\\\\\}:\\\\sum_i \\\\\\\\mathbf{w}_i\\\\^2 \\\\leq P}{\\\\mathrm{maximize}} \\\\sum_{k=1}^K a_k \\\\log_2(1+\\\\textrm{SINR}_k) for some positive weights a_k that represent the user priority. The weighted sum rate is maximized by weighted MMSE precoding that selects :\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\textrm{W-MMSE}}_k = \\\\sqrt{p_k} \\\\frac{( \\\\mathbf{I} + \\\\sum_{i eq k} q_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i^H )^{-1} \\\\mathbf{h}_k}{\\\\( \\\\mathbf{I} + \\\\sum_{i eq k} q_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i^H )^{-1} \\\\mathbf{h}_k\\\\} for some positive coefficients q_1,\\\\ldots,q_K (related to the user weights) that satisfy \\\\sum_{i=1}^K q_i = P and p_i is the optimal power allocation. The suboptimal MRT approach removes the channel inversion and only selects :\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\mathrm{MRT}}_k = \\\\sqrt{p_k} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{h}_k}{\\\\\\\\mathbf{h}_k\\\\}, while the suboptimal ZF precoding makes sure that \\\\mathbf{h}_i^H\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\mathrm{ZF}}_k=0 for all i ‚â† k and thus the interference can be removed in the SINR expression: :\\\\textrm{SINR}^{\\\\mathrm{ZF}}_k = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{h}_k^H\\\\mathbf{w}_k^{\\\\mathrm{ZF}}^2}{\\\\sigma_k^2}. =Uplink- downlink duality= For comparison purposes, it is instructive to compare the downlink results with the corresponding uplink MIMO channel where the same single-antenna users transmit to the same base station, having N receive antennas. The input-output relationship can be described as :\\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\\\mathbf{h}_k \\\\sqrt{q_k} s_k + \\\\mathbf{n} where s_k is the transmitted symbol for user k, q_k is the transmit power for this symbol, \\\\mathbf{y} and \\\\mathbf{n} are the N \\\\times 1 vector of received signals and noise respectively, \\\\mathbf{h}_k is the N \\\\times 1 vector of channel coefficients. If the base station uses linear receive filters to combine the received signals on the N antennas, the SINR for the data stream from user k becomes :\\\\textrm{SINR}^{\\\\mathrm{uplink}}_k = \\\\frac{q_k\\\\mathbf{h}_k^H\\\\mathbf{v}_k^2}{\\\\sigma_k^2+\\\\sum_{i eq k} q_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i^H\\\\mathbf{v}_k^2} where \\\\mathbf{v}_k is the unit-norm receive filter for this user. Compared with the downlink case, the only difference in the SINR expressions is that the indices are switched in the interference term. Remarkably, the optimal receive filters are the same as the weighted MMSE precoding vectors, up to a scaling factor: :\\\\mathbf{v}^{\\\\textrm{MMSE}}_k = \\\\frac{( \\\\mathbf{I} + \\\\sum_{i eq k} q_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i^H )^{-1} \\\\mathbf{h}_k}{\\\\( \\\\mathbf{I} + \\\\sum_{i eq k} q_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i^H )^{-1} \\\\mathbf{h}_k\\\\} Observe that the coefficients q_1,\\\\ldots,q_K that was used in the weighted MMSE precoding are exactly the optimal power coefficients in the uplink (that maximize the weighted sum rate). This important relationship between downlink precoding and uplink receive filtering is known as the uplink-downlink duality.M. Schubert and H. Boche, Solution of the multiuser downlink beamforming problem with individual SINR constraints, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, vol. 53, no. 1, pp. 18-28, 2004.A. Wiesel, Y.C. Eldar, S. Shamai, Linear precoding via conic optimization for fixed MIMO receivers, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 54, no. 1, pp. 161-176, 2006. As the downlink precoding problem usually is more difficult to solve, it often useful to first solve the corresponding uplink problem. = Limited feedback precoding = The precoding strategies described above was based on having perfect channel state information at the transmitter. However, in real systems, receivers can only feed back quantized information that is described by a limited number of bits. If the same precoding strategies are applied, but now based on inaccurate channel information, additional interference appears. This is an example on limited feedback precoding. The received signal in multi-user MIMO with limited feedback precoding is mathematically described as :y_k = \\\\mathbf{h}_k^H \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{w}}_i s_i +n_k, \\\\quad k=1,2, \\\\ldots, K. In this case, the beamforming vectors are distorted as \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{w}}_i = \\\\mathbf{w}_i + \\\\mathbf{e}_i, where \\\\mathbf{w}_i is the optimal vector and \\\\mathbf{e}_i is the error vector caused by inaccurate channel state information. The received signal can be rewritten as :y_k = \\\\mathbf{h}_k^H \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\mathbf{w}_i s_i + \\\\mathbf{h}_k^H \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\mathbf{e}_i s_i+ n_k, \\\\quad k=1,2, \\\\ldots, K where \\\\mathbf{h}_k^H \\\\sum_{i eq k} \\\\mathbf{e}_i s_i is the additional interference at user k according to the limited feedback precoding. To reduce this interference, higher accuracy in the channel information feedback is required, which in turn reduces the throughput in the uplink.

Nuttall was educated at Hereford Cathedral School, Watford Grammar School for Boys and Merton College, Oxford, where he studied both Classical Moderations and English Literature. As a postgraduate he wrote a B.Litt thesis on Shakespeare's The Tempest subsequently published as Two Concepts of Allegory (1968), and considered by some to be his most original book. Nuttall first taught at Sussex University where he was successively lecturer, reader and professor of English and where his students included the philosopher A. C. Grayling and the critic and biographer Robert Fraser. After a tumultuous period as pro-vice-chancellor at Sussex, he moved on to New College, Oxford, in 1984, eventually being elected to an Oxford chair. His published works include studies of Shakespeare and works on the connections between philosophy and literature. Prominent among the first is Shakespeare the Thinker (2007), in which he criticised his earlier work as needlessly forcing Shakespeare into an abstract metaphysical framework. Instead, Nuttall attempted to undo this tradition through a 'pataphysical approach, where everyday objects such as eggs, tennis rackets, and other mundane phenomena acquire an absurd metalepsis in their satiric relation to Shakespeare's tragedies.' In a more philosophical tradition, A Common Sky traces the literary repercussions of both the English empiricist tradition and the idea of solipsism. His work is characterised throughout by wide reading (especially in classical sources), common sense, a deep and broad humanity, a robust sense of humour and by occasional‚Äîand sometimes eccentric‚Äîreferences to popular culture (In Shakespeare the Thinker, for example, he cites the TV series Wife Swap.) His elder brother Jeff Nuttall was a poet and an important figure in 1960s counterculture. To him he dedicated his book The Alternative Trinity, a study of the Gnostic tradition in English literature through Marlowe and Milton to William Blake, a poet to whom both brothers had been attracted in their youth, if in rather different ways.

Jet aircraft It was during a visit by Frank Whittle to Gloster that Carter became involved in the development of jet aircraft. At the time Gloster were working on a twin-boom fighter, for specification F.18/37 - also used for the Hawker Typhoon, to be powered by a Napier Sabre piston engine which attracted the attention of Whittle who thought that the layout would be suitable for his new engine. Although the design Whittle saw would not progress beyond the project stage, within a few weeks, Carter was asked by the Air Ministry to submit plans for a brand new aircraft to use Whittle's engine. He agreed to the project before seeing the engine for himself. While not impressed with the engine itself, when he saw it running he was convinced that it could develop into a suitable powerplant given what they had managed to achieve in the somewhat primitive conditions at Lutterworth. Gloster E.28/39 The Gloster E.28/39 was designed primarily to prove the concept of turbojet powered flight, the Air Ministry however insisted that the design include provision for four guns and 2,000 rounds of ammunition even if these were not fitted in the prototype. The contract to build the E.28/39 also known as the Pioneer was placed with Gloster on 3 February 1940. The aircraft was built in secret at the Regents garage, Cheltenham and first flew on 15 April 1941 at RAF Cranwell, becoming the first British and Allied jet aircraft. Even before the Pioneer flew, the Air Ministry encouraged Carter to design a practical jet fighter since the Pioneer was not suitable because it was unlikely that an engine of at least thrust would be available in the near future. Carter therefore decided that the design would require two engines. The result was designated the F.9/40 which first flew on 5 March 1943 and would find worldwide fame as the Gloster Meteor. His later designs included the E.1/44. He supervised the design of the Gloster GA-5 delta-wing fighter (later the Gloster Javelin which first flew in 1951 from RAF Moreton Valence south of Gloucester), which was designed by Richard Walker (Gloster's chief designer) and powered by Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines. Honours Gloster Meteor Along with other pioneering aircraft designers, Carter was honoured in 1997 with the issuance of a special postage stamp in a series called \\"The Architects of the Air.\\" Other partnerships featured on the stamps were R. J. Mitchell and Supermarine's celebrated Spitfire on the 20p stamp, R.E. Bishop and the de Havilland company's Mosquito on a 37p stamp and Sydney Camm, designer of the Hawker Hunter fighter, featured on the 63p value. Chairman of Royal Mail's Stamp Advisory Committee, Adam Novak said: \\"Each one of the aircraft featured on the stamps was unique and revolutionary in its own way. The Architects of the Air were the trail blazers for today's modern aircraft designs.\\"Stamp Designs Pay Tribute To Revolutionary British Aircraft.\\" prnewswire.co. Retrieved: 11 May 2011.\\" George Carter's face dramatically forms the clouds overlooking a flight of a Meteor Mk T7 on the 1997 43p stamp. Personal life (Wilfred) George Carter was born in Bedford. His father George Alfred Carter was a journeyman carpenter and later became a builder. Carter married Hilda Back at St Martin's, Bedford on 20 April 1916. They had a son, Wilfred Maxwell (Peter), born in 1917. Carter became CBE in 1947, and lived on Cold Slad Lane in Crickley Hill, Gloucester. He was awarded the RAeS Silver Medal in 1947.

It was published in 2007 by Wizard Books. It forms part of Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy series. It is the 29th in the Wizard series. It is the first completely original Fighting Fantasy gamebook published by Wizard (Eye of the Dragon is an extended version of the adventure from Ian Livingstone's earlier book Dicing with Dragons). The book is made up of 515 references rather than the usual 400. Howl of the Werewolf was voted the best gamebook in the series in a 2011 poll in Fighting Fantazine.Jonathan Green's blog, 14 February 2011 (retrieved 2 April 2014).  Story  To find the cure for their lycanthropy, the player must travel through oppressed towns to reach Castle Wulfen. On the way they may find several important items that they will use in your final battle against Count Varcolac.  Setting  The book's setting of Lupravia is another of the principalities of Mauristatia, like Mortvania which featured in the previous Fighting Fantasy book Vault of the Vampire. Lupravia is an exclusive location for this book. It is a highly gothic setting that includes many vampiric monsters such as werewolves.  Creation  Green had conceived the idea of Howl of the Werewolf before the cancellation of the series by Puffin Books. Green came up with the premise, the name of the book, the beginning of the story and the very end, along with a few background details at this earlier time, but came up with the majority of the ideas in the book when he began plotting it in 2006. In writing the book, Green wanted to create an adventure that drew on the mythology and folklore surrounding werewolves, having found that their previous appearances in Fighting Fantasy took the form of shallow side-encounters. Green has stated that he took the criticisms of his previous work on the official Fighting Fantasy website forums into account when writing Howl of the Werewolf. The procedure for creating a character in Howl of the Werewolf is somewhat different than for previous Fighting Fantasy books.

The game was never officially released, but found widespread distribution through the HP INTEREX user community. It became so popular among HP users that the authors were compelled to include a mechanism to prevent playing it during working hours. Warp is arguably one of the most advanced text adventure games ever created. Its main strength is its command parser, which attempts to understand complex natural English syntax such as \\"Go west and get everything but the lamp from the toolbox\\" or \\"Backtrack 2 moves. Next, inspect the peg and fountain\\". The command processor supports macros (custom commands), recursion, conditional tests, and multiple saved states, making it conceivable for one to construct a script that can play the game from start to finish. The world of Warp is extensive, interesting and dangerous. Most of the action takes place in a large sea resort, including islands and reefs which can be explored by boat. The game's name alludes to an interesting twist in the world's laws of physics. There are many ways to die, and a player will likely experience all of them before figuring out how to collect all the treasures and win the game. For the clever few who get that far, there is an endgame with even more puzzles to solve. Warp for the HP 3000 was originally coded in about 17,000 lines of HP 3000 Pascal combined with some 6000 lines of textual data.

Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the little woodpecker. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name Picus passerinus and cited Brisson's work. Linnaeus mistakenly specified the type location as Dominica. This has been corrected to Cayenne in French Guiana. The specific name passerinus is from Latin and means \\"sparrow like\\". This species is now placed in the genus Veniliornis that was introduced by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854.

Based in Los Angeles, California, US, the company specializes in documentary television and film productions, with credits including the Million Dollar Listing docuseries, RuPaul's Drag Race, and documentary films Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures (2016), and The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2000). The duo have produced programming for HBO, Bravo, HGTV, Showtime, BBC, Netflix, and VH1, and are considered pioneers in LGBTQ programming ‚Äì having won an Outfest Annual Achievement Award in 2011. World of Wonder was instrumental in building the career of drag queen RuPaul, first as his managers, and eventually producing the majority of the franchises live shows, podcasts, television specials, and conventions.  History  Filmmakers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato at the Miami International Film Festival presentation of Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures (2016). Photo: David Heischrek Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato founded World of Wonder after meeting in NYU's graduate film program in the mid-'80s. Intent on becoming famous, they formed a disco-pop-rock duo called the Fabulous Pop Tarts under their \\"World of Wonder\\" record label and began performing regularly at Danceteria and other clubs in downtown New York City.Pike, L (2006). \\"Channel XYZ: drag queens, club kids, and amateur erotic filmmakers make WOW TV the online outlet for artists on the edge\\", Los Angeles Magazine, as archived on gcnext.com, retrieved April 4, 2009. They produced two albums, Age of the Thing which included their hit single, \\"New York City Beat\\", and Gagging on the Lovely Extravaganza, which included guest appearances by Lady Miss Kier, RuPaul, Martyn Phillips, and Filthy the Dog. World of Wonder was organized initially in order to manage the Fabulous Pop Tarts, enable projects in television production and licensing, documentary film-making, and career expansion of their friends and fellow artists, particularly RuPaul. Bailey and Barbato began their partnership with drag queen RuPaul in Atlanta in the 1980s and have worked together ever since. They produced RuPaul's first album, \\"RuPaul is Star Booty,\\" in 1986 and became his manager shortly after launching World of Wonder in 1991. They have since produced all of his television shows, his DragCon bi-coastal conventions and music productions, earning multiple Emmy Awards along the way. World of Wonder shares its name with one of its early television documentaries, Died on the 4th of July: Nelson Sullivan's World of Wonder. Nelson Sullivan was a central figure in the downtown New York City art and club scene of the 1980s, obsessively videotaping everyone and everything he saw before dying of a heart attack on July 4, 1989. He left behind over 1200 hours of video footage that he'd shot over the last ten years of his life. From this archive World of Wonder created the one-hour documentary portrait of Nelson which aired on UK's Channel 4, and is also included on the DVD release of Party Monster: The Shockumentary. Based, in part, on this documentary, Sullivan has continued to gain respect as a noted historian, with his videos gaining a younger and wider viewership on YouTube. The early focus on Nelson Sullivan formed the basis of the company's ongoing interest in documentary film-making. In 2014, Bailey and Barbato were honored with the IDA Pioneer Award, \\"celebrating exceptional achievement, leadership, and vision in the nonfiction and documentary community\\". World of Wonder operates out of a historical art-deco building on Hollywood Boulevard. Designed by architects S. Tilden Norton and Fredrick H. Wallis and erected in 1930, the building served as the original home of the Directors Guild of America. The World of Wonder Storefront Gallery now occupies the ground floor retail space, with production and management offices occupying the upper three stories. The basement, once home to the punk rock club The Masque, now houses the company's video archive and a soundstage.  Television  World of Wonder primarily produces television content for networks in the US and UK, including BBC, Channel 4, FIVE, HBO, Cinemax, TLC, PBS, Showtime, A&E;, MTV, VH1 and Bravo.

It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build cross-platform services which can connect applications written in a variety of languages and frameworks, including ActionScript, C, C++,Thrift Requirements, see this issue for Windows support C#, Cappuccino,Fred Potter, Using Thrift with Cappuccino , parallel48's posterously luscious blog, 10 June 2010.

It was developed at Facebook and it is now (2020) an open source project in the Apache Software Foundation. The implementation was described in an April 2007 technical paper released by Facebook, now hosted on Apache.Mark Slee, Aditya Agarwal, Marc Kwiatkowski, Thrift: Scalable Cross-Language Services Implementation Architecture The Apache Thrift API client/server architecture Thrift includes a complete stack for creating clients and servers. The top part is generated code from the Thrift definition. From this file, the services generate client and processor code. In contrast to built-in types, created data structures are sent as result in generated code. The protocol and transport layer are part of the runtime library. With Thrift, it is possible to define a service and change the protocol and transport without recompiling the code. Besides the client part, Thrift includes server infrastructure to tie protocols and transports together, like blocking, non-blocking, and multi-threaded servers. The underlying I/O part of the stack is implemented differently for different languages. Thrift supports a number of protocols: * TBinaryProtocol ‚Äì A straightforward binary format, simple, but not optimized for space efficiency. Faster to process than the text protocol but more difficult to debug. * TCompactProtocol ‚Äì More compact binary format; typically more efficient to process as well * TJSONProtocol ‚Äì Uses JSON for encoding of data. * TSimpleJSONProtocol ‚Äì A write-only protocol that cannot be parsed by Thrift because it drops metadata using JSON. Suitable for parsing by scripting languages. The supported transports are: * TSimpleFileTransport ‚Äì This transport writes to a file. * TFramedTransport ‚Äì This transport is required when using a non-blocking server. It sends data in frames, where each frame is preceded by length information. * TMemoryTransport ‚Äì Uses memory for I/O. The Java implementation uses a simple internally. * TSocket ‚Äì Uses blocking socket I/O for transport. * TZlibTransport ‚Äì Performs compression using zlib. Used in conjunction with another transport. Thrift also provides a number of servers, which are * TNonblockingServer ‚Äì A multi-threaded server using non-blocking I/O (Java implementation uses NIO channels). TFramedTransport must be used with this server. * TSimpleServer ‚Äì A single-threaded server using standard blocking I/O. Useful for testing. * TThreadedServer ‚Äì A multi-threaded server using a thread per connection model and standard blocking I/O. * TThreadPoolServer ‚Äì A multi-threaded server using a thread pool and standard blocking I/O. Benefits Some stated benefits of Thrift include: * Cross- language serialization with lower overhead than alternatives such as SOAP due to use of binary format. * A lean and clean library. No framework to code. No XML configuration files. * The language bindings feel natural. For example, Java uses . C++ uses \`std::vector\`. * The application-level wire format and the serialization-level wire format are cleanly separated. They can be modified independently. * The predefined serialization styles include: binary, HTTP-friendly and compact binary. * Doubles as cross-language file serialization. * of the protocol. Thrift does not require a centralized and explicit mechanism like major-version/minor-version. Loosely coupled teams can freely evolve RPC calls. * No build dependencies or non-standard software. No mix of incompatible software licenses. Creating a Thrift service Thrift is written in C++, but can create code for a number of languages. To create a Thrift service, one has to write Thrift files that describe it, generate the code in the destination language, write some code to start the server, and call it from the client. Here is a code example of such a description file: enum PhoneType { HOME, WORK, MOBILE, OTHER } struct Phone { 1: i32 id, 2: string number, 3: PhoneType type } service PhoneService { Phone findById(1: i32 id), list findAll() } Thrift will generate the code out of this descriptive information. For instance, in Java, the \`PhoneType\` will be a simple \`enum\` inside the \`Phone\` class.

Early history The racetrack was built by a group of prominent businessmen from the New York City area who formed the Coney Island Jockey Club in 1879. Led by Leonard Jerome, James R. Keene, and the track's president, William Kissam Vanderbilt, the Club held seasonal race cards at nearby Prospect Park fairgrounds until construction of the new race course was completed. On June 19, 1880 the track hosted its first day of Thoroughbred racing. Old maps and railroad track diagrams for the Manhattan Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road showing the spur that served both the club and the racetrack indicates the entrance to the club was located on the east side of Ocean Avenue between Avenues X and Y. The Sheepshead Bay Race Track station contained six tracks and three island platforms. In its first year of operations, the new Sheepshead Bay track hosted a 1¬Ω mile match race between two of the top horses racing at the time in the United States. The Dwyer Brothers' Luke Blackburn was ridden by Jim McLaughlin, and Pierre Lorillard's Uncas was ridden by Tom Costello. Luke Blackburn won by twenty lengths. Sheepshead Bay had both a dirt and a turf course. Principal backers were: *August Belmont Jr. *Leonard Jerome *James G. K. Lawrence *Pierre Lorillard IV *A. Wright Sanford *William R. Travers *William Kissam Vanderbilt The new Sheepshead Bay Race Track's premier event was the Suburban Handicap, first run on June 10, 1884 and conceived by James G. K. Lawrence, who became the track's president. Four years later Lawrence would also create the Futurity Stakes, first run on Labor Day in 1888. At the time, the Futurity was the richest race ever run in the United States. Today, both the Suburban and the Futurity are ongoing Graded stakes races held at the Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont on Long Island. The Lawrence Realization Stakes was named for James G. K. Lawrence. First turf course in the United States On June 10, 1886 the Coney Island Jockey Club opened the first turf racecourse in the United States. The Club replaced the Sheepshead Bay steeplechase course with a one-mile turf course, built inside the existing main dirt track. The Green Grass Stakes was the first race on turf and was run as part of the June 10 opening day program. A race for three- year-old horses, it was contested at a distance of a mile and an eighth and was won by Emory & Cotton's Dry Monopole in a time of 157.00. Demise In 1908, the administration of Governor Charles Evans Hughes signed into law the Hart‚ÄìAgnew bill that effectively banned all racetrack betting in the state of New York. The legislation allowed for fines and up to a year in prison which was strictly enforced. Compounding matters for the Sheepshead Bay track was intense competition. In a summary of 1909 racing, the Daily Racing Form reported that \\"Sheepshead Bay, which for years led the country in daily average distribution, yielded first place in 1909 to Belmont Park, which August Belmont and his associates are ambitious to make the \\"turf headquarters of America\\".\\" A 1910 amendment to the Hart‚ÄìAgnew legislation added further restrictions that made the owners and directors of a racetrack personally liable for any betting done on their premises, with or without their consent. Such an onerous liability was intolerable and meant that by 1911 all racetracks in the state ceased operations. Although a February 21, 1913 ruling by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division paved the way for racing to resume that year, by then it was too late for horse racing at the Sheepshead Bay Race Track and it was ultimately sold to the Sheepshead Bay Speedway Corporation who used it for automobile racing. In December 1919, what the Daily Racing Form called one of the most famous racetracks in the history of the American turf, was purchased for real estate development. The facility was torn down and the land subdivided into building lots.

They are operated by their owners or investors, rather than a not-for-profit institution, religious organization, or government. Because they are not funded by tax money, their long-term sustainability is dependent on the value they provide relative to the perceived value of a degree from a higher educational institution overall. The increased reliance on federal student aid funds by these \\"for-profit\\" schools is of growing concern. Since federal student loans are typically guaranteed by the government, for-profit colleges can reap a profit from taxpayers even if students drop out after enrolling, do not complete a degree, or the degree turns out to be nearly worthless for future employment. Students can be stuck with large and unmanageable debt loads, defaulting at a significantly higher rate than students at traditional non-profit institutions. Non-profit institutions generally depend in part on academic excellence and creating graduates that succeed in their fields, while for-profit schools are often based on attracting large numbers of students with few requirements in terms of academic qualifications for entry because federal loans are provided for good and bad students alike. Some institutions in this category are regionally accredited, while many others are not. Sometimes a proprietary college may also overlap with the sector of non-degree granting business colleges. Students should exercise caution, before enrolling, about the validity and transferability of the degrees and credits earned at proprietary colleges. If a college is not regionally accredited, its credits will probably not be accepted by other colleges, and its degrees or certificates may not be recognized by employers. Every college claims to be accredited, but except in some specific areas such as nursing, regional accreditation is by far the most important type of accreditation. National accreditation is usually less rigorous. Traditionally, a common argument against for-profit universities has been that the science and theory behind the learning technique is more important than the profit or specific skills gained, thus profit or financial success should not be a motivational factor in education. The argument in favor of for-profit universities has been that a student learning from a professor who has never needed to produce their product or service for profit is ill-prepared for a free-enterprise system. However, as non-profit colleges and universities increasingly utilize professionals and former professionals in their teaching faculties, this distinction has become less significant. History in the United States While to some extent proprietary colleges have always existed, their numbers and ubiquitous nature exploded after 1992 when then-committee chairman John Boehner (R-Ohio) of the House of Representatives' Committee on Education and the Workforce killed a federal regulation known as the \\"90-10 rule\\", and by simplifying the definition of \\"institution of higher education\\" to place for- profit schools on par with nonprofit colleges regarding federal-aid eligibility. The idea behind the 90-10 rule was that if a proprietary school's offerings were truly valuable‚Äîfor example, if they filled some niche that traditional State and private non-profit educational institutions did not‚Äîthen surely 10% of their students would be willing to pay completely out-of-pocket, i.e., those who fell above federal guidelines for receiving taxpayer subsidies to attend college. Traditional educational institutions routinely met this bar without even paying attention.

The village is situated halfway between Bradford and Halifax, on the A6036 road.shelfhalifax.wordpress.com In 2001 it had a population of 4,496. At the 2011 Census Shelf was measured as part of the Calderdale ward of Northowram and Shelf. History In the Domesday Book the village is called \\"Scelf.\\" The place name probably derives from the Anglo Saxon word 'Scelf', suggesting a broad and level shelf of land. In the period before 1700 Shelf developed from a mixed moorland and forested landscape to a few scattered farmsteads; to a landscape full of activity. Shelf gained a number of mills and workers cottages during the Industrial Revolution, and there are a number of historical relics including a stone horse trough and a stone chair milestone originally erected in 1737 which gave rise to the local area being named Stone Chair, Shelf. Prior to 1851, Shelf was a part of the large Parish of Halifax. The Parish Church of Shelf St. Michael and All Angels Church was built in 1850 and there were a number of chapels of other denominations, including an Independent Methodist, Bethel Chapel. On a secular level the village was administered by a 'Local Board' established in 1863, and then by the 'Shelf Urban District Council' from 1894 to 1937. From 1937 to 1974, Shelf formed part of Queensbury and Shelf, an urban district in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Queensbury and Shelf consisted of Queensbury and Shelf. Queensbury and Shelf was split in 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, with the Shelf part going to the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale, and the rest going to the Metropolitan Borough of Bradford. Shelf village centre has many shops and facilities such as a bakery and pharmacy. There is a Village Hall, and a new library was opened in 2009. There is a local Lidl supermarket. The village is on the route of the Calderdale Way, a circular walk around the hills and valleys of Calderdale. Notable residents Joseph Jagger, a man reputed to have broken the bank at Monte Carlo was born at Shelf although, contrary to popular belief, he did not inspire the song \\"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo.\\" Lucius Smith the first Bishop of Knaresborough was born at the Vicarage at Shelf in 1860. Kathleen Hale, author of the series of children's books about Orlando the Marmalade Cat also lived at the vicarage from 1903 to 1905, and developed her interest in plants, flowers and drawing there. Edward Hartley, an early socialist politician retired to Shelf, and is buried at Bethel Chapel in the village. Much-travelled footballer Frank Worthington was born in the village, as was interior designer and TV presenter Linda Barker. Former Blue Peter presenter John Noakes was born at Shelf and Coronation Street actor Joe Duttine is also from the village.

Above the square, Church of the Holy Trinity; to right of church, Brunet Palace. In distance on hill, Ermita de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria de la Popa. The Plaza Mayor in Trinidad, Cuba, is the historic centre of the town, declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. History The buildings surrounding the plaza (central square) date from the 18th and 19th centuries when trade in sugar from the nearby Valle de los Ingenios and the slave trade brought great riches to the area. Many of the buildings surrounding the plaza belonged to the wealthy landowners of the city. When the trade in sugar diminished and the slave trade ended in the mid-19th century, Trinidad became a backwater and little building work occurred until the 1950s. As a result, many of the historic buildings and streets were preserved, especially the grand colonial edifices in the immediate vicinity of the Plaza Mayor. Today, most of the former houses surrounding the square serve to house museums. Plaza The small sloping Plaza Mayor has gardens on a raised platform, with paths dividing it in quarters. The resulting four small garden beds are fenced off by white wrought-iron fences. Cobbled streets surround the square, separating it from the surrounding buildings. Wrought-iron lamp-posts, statues of English greyhounds, and columns with large terra-cotta finials decorate the plaza. Buildings The barrotes of the 18th century (left), were replaced in the 19th century by grilles decorated with ornamental motifs (right) The colonial houses of Trinidad are typified by red terracotta tiled roofs supported beyond the walls by wooden beams. Pastel-coloured paintwork for the houses is normal with wood and plasterwork details picked out in different colours to the brickwork. The large main door typically has a smaller entrance door (or doors) cut into it. In contrast to the houses of the same period in Havana the door tends to open directly onto a living area, rather than having a vestibule or entrance hall. The doors are often surrounded by architectural plaster mouldings. Windows lack glass, instead they are open to the elements, but have barrotes, bars constructed of small turned wooden columns which allow the air to circulate without allowing entrance to the house. In the 19th century these wooden barriers were replaced by wooden shutters behind a wrought-iron grille. The large windows are normally raised slightly from ground-level but can be flush to the pavement. Arched windows are also common, but are enclosed with radiating wooden slats. 19th-century houses tend to be built around a small courtyard with the rooms facing onto it. Selected buildings Buildings and plazas within the World Heritage Site include: =Iglesia Parroquial de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad= Above the plaza to the north-east stands the Church of the Holy Trinity (Iglesia Parroquial de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad). Construction began on the current church in the late 19th century and it was completed in 1892. It was built on the site of a previous 17th-century church that was destroyed during the 19th century by a cyclone which damaged a great many buildings in Trinidad. The church contains an 18th-century wooden statue of Christ, \\"The Lord of the True Cross\\" (\\"El Se√±or de la Vera Cruz\\") which is an object of particular reverence in Trinidad. Originally destined for a church in Veracruz in Mexico, the ship carrying the statue was driven back to Trinidad three times by bad weather and was only able to make the journey after abandoning part of its cargo which included the statue of Christ. This was taken as divine intervention by the local population and the statue has been housed in the church ever since. Also housed within the building is a large Gothic revival altar dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Piedad). The church has a Neoclassical fa√ßade, but little architectural attention was paid to the mostly concealed rear of the church. To the right of the church is a flight of steps leading to the Casa de la Musica (House of Music), a modern building constructed in a style similar to those nearby. =La Casa de los Conspiradores= Beyond the steps to the left of the Church is the House of the Conspirators (La Casa de los Consipiradores). This has a wooden balcony on one corner overlooking the square and is named because it was the former meeting place of the Cuban nationalist secret society La Rosa de Cuba (The Rose of Cuba). Further down the street is the Plazuela de la Trova, a small square surrounded by 18th-century houses including the Casa de la Trova which features wooden barrotes and is now a live music venue. =Palacio Brunet= To the left of the Church of the Holy Trinity stands the Brunet Palace (Palacio Brunet) which was built in 1812 by Jos√© Mariano Borrell y Padr√≥n, head of the wealthy Borrell family. It takes its name from Count Nicol√°s de la Cruz Brunet y Mu√±oz, the husband of Borrell's daughter who inherited the house on Borrell's death. It now houses the Romantic Museum (Museo Rom√°ntico), mostly displaying objects that belonged to the Borrell family. The house has a central balustraded courtyard, and still features the original marble floor, frescoes, and neoclassical decoration. In the kitchen the original painted earthenware tiles can still be seen. convertible peso piece features a view of the bell tower of the Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco. =Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco= At the opposite end of Calle Hern√°ndez Echerri to the Palacio Brunet stands the Church and Monastery of Saint Francis (Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco) which houses the Museum of the Fight against Bandits (Museo de la Lucha contra Bandidos). The bandits in question were the counter-revolution forces that took refuge in the nearby Escambray Mountains (Sierra del Escambray) after the Cuban revolution and fought against Fidel Castro's government in the Escambray Revolt. Built in 1813 by Franciscan friars, the building became a parish church in 1848, and in 1895 was converted into a garrison for Spanish troops. The church fell into disrepair, and in 1920 much of it was demolished, leaving only the bell tower and a few nearby buildings. The 25 centavo (25 cent) convertible peso coin shows the bell tower of the church viewed from the corner of the Plaza Mayor on the obverse. Below the Church of Saint Francis is Plazuela del Jig√ºe, a small square where Bartolom√© de Las Casas celebrated the first Mass in Trinidad in 1514. The El Jig√ºe restaurant is unusually porticoed and decorated with hand-painted tiles. =Museo de Arqueolog√≠a Guamuhaya= On the east side of the Plaza Mayor is the Museum of Guamuhaya Archeology (Museo de Arqueolog√≠a Guamuhaya). Guamuhaya is the name for the local area in one of the languages of the indigenous Cubans, and the museum features Pre-Columbianb finds as well as articles from the time of the Spanish conquest. The building was constructed in the 18th century. Although who the original owner was is not clear, the building was purchased in the 19th century by Antonio Padr√≥n, who added a portico facing the square and extended the roof. Alexander von Humboldt stayed with Padr√≥n during his visit to Cuba, and his bust is displayed in the courtyard of the building. The Casa de Aldem√°n Ortiz shows many typical features of the Colonial houses of Trinidad. =Casa de los S√°nchez Iznaga= On the other side of the square from the Museum of Guamuhaya Archeology is the House of the S√°nchez Iznaga (Casa de los S√°nchez Iznaga) which houses the Museum of Colonial Architecture (Museo de Arquitectura Colonial). This building was originally two houses in the 18th century, both owned by the sugar barons of the S√°nchez Iznaga family (who owned the Manaca Iznaga estate in the nearby Valley de los Ingenios). The two houses, joined in the 19th century, show the typical grilled and shuttered windows, and feature an elegant portico with slim columns and a delicate wrought-iron balustrade, in contrast to the heavier pillars and ironwork of the Museum of Guamuhaya Archaeology on the other side of the square. Inside, the museum features items from Trinidad's architectural history (including an elaborate 19th-century shower) and details the history of building in the Colonial period. =Casa de Aldem√°n Ortiz= At the bottom of the square is the House of Mayor Ortiz (Casa de Aldem√°n Ortiz), built in 1809 by Ortiz de Z√∫√±√≠ga, who later became Mayor of Trinidad. The house shows many of the typical features of Trinidadian houses, including the large entrance door with two smaller doors cut into it, the barrotes covering the large windows and a terracotta tiled roof with large wooden supports. It is less typical in that it has a projecting balcony running along two sides. On January 2014, after years remodeling it became Bodeguita del Medio de Trinidad. =Palacio Cantero ‚Äî Museo de Historia Municipal= One side of the Casa de Aldem√°n Ortiz faces onto the Calle Sim√≥n Bol√≠var; slightly down this road is the Cantero Palace (Palacio Cantero) one of the largest and most impressive of the houses surrounding the Plaza Mayor. Grander than most buildings nearby, it features a spacious entrance hall that opens on to a large galleried courtyard. Original frescoes survive on the plasterwork of the main hall, and a tower accessible from the courtyard gives views over the Plaza Mayor, the city of Trinidad, and the sea. The house is now used as the Municipal History Museum (Museo de Historia Municipal) which details the history of Trinidad. Originally built in 1828 by Don Jose Mariano Borrell y Padron, one of the richest men in Trinidad, it was inherited by his son Jose Mariano Borrell y Lemus, Marques de Guaimaro and then bought in 1841 by Maria Monserrate Fernandez de Lara y Borrell, a niece of the older Jose Mariano. In 1842 Justo German Cantero y Owar-Anderson, a local doctor, married Pedro Iznaga's widow, Maria Monserrate, and it was the home of the Cantero/Fernandez de Lara family until the late 19th century.

Benn debuted in 1999/00, as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler. He is also a fairly useful left-handed batsman with a first-class average of 17.48. Since his debut season, Benn has had to fight hard for a place in a Barbados team containing four West Indian international fast bowlers. International career Following a series of strong performances in the 2007/08 Carib Beer Cup, Benn was called up to the West Indies Test squad. He beat off competition from Amit Jaggernauth for the spinner's spot and on 22 March 2008 he made his debut for the West Indies in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Providence Stadium, Guyana. He bowled quite well in Sri Lanka's first innings, bowling 40 overs at an economy of 3.00, but went unrewarded. In his first Test innings he scored 28 and helped contribute to some useful lower-order resistance after the West Indies top order had been dismissed cheaply. In Sri Lanka's second innings, he claimed his first Test wicket, Mahela Jayawardene (caught by Shivnarine Chanderpaul), and finished with 3/59. He could only manage 7 with the bat in his second innings as the West Indies slid to defeat by 121 runs. On 6 December 2009, on the third day of the 2nd test against Australia, Benn managed his first five- wicket haul with career best figures of 5/155 after bowling 53 overs for the innings. In the third test between West Indies and Australia at the WACA, Benn came under scrutiny for a mid-pitch altercation with Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson after tangling with Johnson when attempting to field the ball and he was subsequently banned for two ODIs after being found guilty of breaching the spirit of the game. On 28 February 2010, in a Twenty20 international against Zimbabwe, Benn became the first bowler to bowl two maiden overs in a Twenty20 international against a nation with test status,Cricinfo records: Most Maidens in a Twenty20 innings finishing with figures of four wickets for six runs. In the 2012 ICC World T20,he along with Nikita Miller set the record for the highest 10th wicket partnership in T20 World Cups(20).This pair's record has been equalled by Steve Finn-Jade Dernbach record partnership for the last wicket in T20 World Cups.  2010 home series against South Africa During the three-test series in June 2010 against South Africa, Benn took 15 wickets at an average of 30.6, and a strike rate of 29.3, and achieved his Test best bowling figures of 6/81 in South Africa's 1st innings in the Third Test. Despite Benn's efforts, his display was tarnished through a spitting incident with South African fast bowler Dale Steyn. Benn was reported to have provoked Steyn to spit on the feet of Benn after his dismissal when batting, and this resulted in a formal complaint to the ICC from Cricket South Africa, which was matched by a complaint from West Indies Cricket also, causing Steyn to lose his match fee.

Concerning this regard it was the basic aim to investigate different methods of operations for agriculture, which should have been used for the purpose of the so-called Germanisierung in Eastern Europe. During June 1941 the camp was constructed by the first prisoners, who were sent from the concentration camp Mauthausen. The concentration camp in Bretstein was an external camp of the concentration camp in Mauthausen located in Upper Austria, which directed about more than 50 external camps. In Bretstein, at least 170 prisoners were locked up in four barracks, which were surrounded by huge fences and some watchtowers. The prisoners, who were Republic Spaniards, Spanish and German members of Jehovah's Witnesses, have been guarded by up to 50 members of the SS unit Totenkopfsturmbannes Mauthausen, who treated them barbarously. They were forced for road works and functioning in the range of agriculture. As a result of the situation within the camp, many attempts to escape were arranged. The remains of seven former caged inmates can be found at the local cemetery in Bretstein. The concentration camp in Bretstein was closed on 25 June 1943.

He studied design and graduated from the Instituto Superior de Dise√±o (High Institute of Design) in 1994. He first worked, for a short period of time, as a designer and art director in films and theatre plays. He then began to paint, working with the basic techniques and incorporating video in his work. When people saw his videos, they told Pavel he was a \\"gifted storyteller\\" and encouraged him to try his hand at cinema. Giroud had to do everything ‚Äì from image to sound and music ‚Äì when he directed his first short films. He even featured his friends in his movies, rather than professional actors. \\"It wasn‚Äôt a massive hit but it made us feel good and made us feel like we were making a real picture\\". From there on, Pavel decided to focus his career on cinema. Giroud only filmed what he wrote, until he read the script of the movie La Edad de la peseta, written by Arturo Infante, a young screenwriter and director. \\"When I first read the script, I didn‚Äôt see in this movie the possibility to express myself as a director\\". However, he gradually and simply fell in love with the script and the movie, \\"Now, I tell Arturo that it‚Äôs my film not his, and that he should forget he wrote it...\\" He finished La Edad de la peseta in 2006. When film critics saw the movie, they dubbed Pavel the \\"new Cuban Truffaut\\" and \\"the finest director of his generation\\". In 2020 this film was selected by Cuban Cinematheque as one of ten Best Cinematography and Best Production Design in 60 years of Cuban Cinema. One year later he directed a noir film titled Omerta and began to write his most ambitious project, The Companion. He spent more than six years developing it and finding financial support to make it. This film was selected as the Cuban entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards. While he developed this film, he co-directed Playing Lecuona, a musical documentary film about the greatest legend of Cuban music, Ernesto Lecuona, starring the jazz pianists Michel Camilo, Chucho Vald√©s and Gonzalo Rubalcaba.John DeFore, \\"'Playing Lecuona': Montreal Review\\", The Hollywood Reporter, 6 September 2015 From 2012 to 2019 he collaborated with the fine arts group Los Carpinteros, directing all of their films (except for one piece). After the breakup of this group, Giroud has continues working with one of it member, Dagoberto Rodr√≠guez, directing an experimental video titled \\"Geometr√≠a Popular\\", released online by Sabrina Amrani Gallery in March, 2020. In 2019 he was the acting coach of the actress Pen√©lope Cruz in Wasp Network, a film by Olivier Assayas. He trained her for more than three months to talk as a Cuban woman and adapted all of her lines in the script to a Cuban way of talking.

The population of the group is around 366,000. Language Kanayatn languages encompass the Brahe, Badame, Jare, and Bang app languages. Socio-linguistically, it is very difficult to specify the language repertoire because it is used with various dialects and patois pronunciation. However, these languages are all considered a part of the Malayic language family which also includes Indonesia's official language, Malay. The increased adoption of Indonesian words by the Kanayatn has drastically changed Dayak Kanayatn dialects for modern speakers. With many speakers of traditional dialects in the older generations, this change has resulted in communication problems between generations. Weapons The Tangkitn is a unique weapon to the Kanayatn people and was used as their primary head-hunting weapon in the past. In the Salako language, the Tangkitn is also referred to as the Parang Pandat. The Kanayatn tribe employed shields to deflect attacks from swords. According to the Kanayatn people in Mempawah (Compaq-mem pa wah Hulu-mental-too-Sada Niang), there are two types of shields in Kanayatn culture: Gun amp and Jabakng. However, according to Kanayatn members in Landak (including sea Ambawang and Kuala Mandor), there is just one type of shield, namely Gun amp. Religion The original religion of the Kanayatn people is not the Kaharingan as it is with the Dayak people. Kanayatn Dayak's indigenous religion is inseparable from their customs (Adat). It can even be said their customs assert their religious identity. In daily practice, Kanayatn Dayak people never mention religion as their normative, but Adat (custom). This religious system is not a Hindu Kaharingan system. Kanayatn people refer to God as Juba. Juba is said to have passed down indigenous customs to the ancestors of Dayak Kanayatn located in Bukit Ba wang (now entering the district Bengkayang). In expressing belief in Jubata, they have a place of worship called \\"panyugu\\" or \\"padagi\\" (kadiaman). It is also important for the panyangahatn priest to become a liaison between man and God (Jubata). Today, many Dayak Kanayatn have embraced other religions, including Christianity and Islam. Kenanyatn people who have embraced another religion may no longer consider themselves as Dayak Kanayatn once they have abandoned their customary practices. Similarly, Kanayatn people who have embraced Islam will no longer regard themselves as Dayak, but as Malay people or Orang laut. Ethnic origins (disputed) The Kanayatn were grouped into the category clump Land Dayak-Kalimantan by H. J. Mallinckrodt; but according to C. H. Duman, they are part of the Kanayatn Dayak Ot Danum Clump-Maanyan-Ngaju. However, research completed by W. Stohr conflicts with C. H. Duman's theory. Stohr's research suggests that when considering aspects of the region, language and customary law, the Dayak Kanayatn group appears to be more closely associated with the Land Dayak-Kalimantan group than the Ot-Danum- Maanyan-Ngaju group. Landmark District names have been based on the majority Dayak community Kanayatn which is part of the clump Land Dayak (or Land Djak in Dutch spelling). Kanayatn and Salako are, in fact, one tribe and Salako people assume that \\"Kanayatn\\" is not the real name of this tribe.

The Blessing of the Throats is a sacramental of the Roman Catholic Church, ordinarily celebrated on February 3, the feast day of Saint Blaise of Sebaste (modern Sivas, Turkey). It also celebrated in some of the Eastern Catholic Churches, and in parishes of the Anglican Communion on the same day as a commemoration. The Order of the Blessing of Throats on the Feast of Saint Blaise is in the Book of Blessings (de Benedictionibus). Background Article 1625 from The Book of Blessings contains a brief historical background of the blessing of throats: Details regarding the miraculous healing of the boy vary. One account relates that the miracle occurred during the journey to take Blaise to prison when he placed his hand on the boy's head and prayed; another that the miracle happened while Blaise was in prison when he picked up two candles provided to him and formed a cross around the boy's throat. The use of candles for the blessing of throats stems from the candles that Blaise used while in prison. When an old woman's pig had been miraculously rescued from a wolf by Saint Blaise, she would visit him in prison, bringing him food and candles to bring him light in his dark cell. Ritual Articles 1626 and 1627 explain when and how the blessing takes place: The candles may be joined together by a red ribbon, the color of martyrdom. Although it is the general custom to touch the throat with the candles, it is not required, especially if the candles are lit. The candles may be held over the person. If all cannot be blessed individually, the celebrant, without candles, extends his hands over the assembly and says the prayer of blessing. The following blessing is said: The priest or deacon makes the sign of the cross over the recipient as the blessing is said. If necessary, laypersons are permitted to give the blessing of the throats, but are instructed not to make the sign of the cross. The ordinary Anglican (Episcopal) version of this prayer is: Old editions of the Rituale Romanum gave the following formula for blessing the candles independently of the February 2 Candlemas blessing: Variations and customs In Germany and in other places, the blessing of throats is given with lighted candles.Austrian blessing with lighted candles, Agrar-Verlag Allg√§u, February 1, 2012. Archived on February 2, 2015.\\"Der Blasiussegen\\" (The Blaise Blessing), official video, Diocese of Eichst√§tt, Germany. February 3, 2014. It is frequently also given on the evening of Candlemas (the previous day), sometimes even on the proximate Sunday, when more people attend Mass than on St. Blaise's proper feast day.

The method can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, add a gene and modify individual base pairs (introduce point mutations). Gene targeting can be permanent or conditional. Conditions can be a specific time during development / life of the organism or limitation to a specific tissue, for example. Gene targeting requires the creation of a specific vector for each gene of interest. However, it can be used for any gene, regardless of transcriptional activity or gene size.  Methods  In general, DNA containing part of the gene to be targeted, a reporter gene, and a (dominant) selectable marker is assembled in bacteria. Gene targeting methods are established for several model organisms and may vary depending on the species used. To target genes in mice, the DNA is inserted into mouse embryonic stem cells in culture. Cells with the insertion can contribute to a mouse's tissue via embryo injection. Finally, chimeric mice where the modified cells make up the reproductive organs are bred. After this step the entire body of the mouse is based on the selected embryonic stem cell. Physcomitrella and knockout-mosses: Deviating phenotypes induced in gene-disruption library transformants. Physcomitrella wild-type and transformed plants were grown on minimal Knop medium to induce differentiation and development of gametophores. For each plant, an overview (upper row, scale bar corresponds to 1 mm) and a close-up (bottom row, scale bar equals 0.5 mm) is shown. A, Haploid wild-type moss plant completely covered with leafy gametophores and close-up of wild- type leaf. B-D, Different Mutants. To target genes in moss, the DNA is incubated together with freshly isolated protoplasts and with polyethylene glycol. As mosses are haploid organisms,Ralf Reski (1998): Development, genetics and molecular biology of mosses. Botanica Acta 111, 1-15. moss filaments (protonema) can be directly screened for the target, either by treatment with antibiotics or with PCR. Unique among plants, this procedure for reverse genetics is as efficient as in yeast.Ralf Reski(1998): Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis: the David and Goliath of reverse genetics. Trends Plant in Science 3, 209-210. Gene targeting has been successfully applied to cattle, sheep, swine and many fungi. The frequency of gene targeting can be significantly enhanced through the use of engineered endonucleases such as zinc finger nucleases, engineered homing endonucleases, and nucleases based on engineered TAL effectors. This method has been applied to species including Drosophila melanogaster, tobacco, corn, human cells, mice and rats.  Comparison with gene trapping  Gene trapping is based on random insertion of a cassette, while gene targeting manipulates a specific gene. Cassettes can be used for many different things while the flanking homology regions of gene targeting cassettes need to be adapted for each gene. This makes gene trapping more easily amenable for large scale projects than targeting. On the other hand, gene targeting can be used for genes with low transcriptions that would go undetected in a trap screen. The probability of trapping increases with intron size, while for gene targeting, small genes are just as easily altered.  Applications Gene targeting has been widely used to study human genetic diseases by removing (\\"knocking out\\"), or adding (\\"knocking in\\"), specific mutations of interest. Previously used to engineer rat cell models, advances in gene targeting technologies enable a new wave of isogenic human disease models. These models are the most accurate in vitro models available to researchers and facilitate the development of personalized drugs and diagnostics, particularly in oncology.  2007 Nobel Prize Mario R.

It existed in two different buildings on the same site, the first built in 1682, the second in 1832. The market was first built on the site of Hungerford House, next to Durham Yard, the town house of the Hungerford family. The house had burned down in 1669 as is recorded in the Diary of Samuel Pepys.25 April/26 April 1669. Samuel Pepys Diary April 1669 It was replaced by a new Italianate market building by Charles Fowler, which opened in 1833. The new market was unsuccessful. It was damaged when the adjoining Hungerford Hall burned down in 1854, and was sold to the South Eastern Railway in 1862. Charing Cross railway station was built on the site and opened in 1864.Charing Cross, the railway stations, and Old Hungerford Market, Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 123-134 accessed: October 15, 2007 Site Schmollinger's map of 1833 showing Old Hungerford Market. Durham House was a previous occupant of the site The site became the property of the Hungerford family of Farleigh Hungerford Castle near Bath in Somerset in 1425, when it was acquired from Sir Robert Chalons and his wife Blanche by Sir Walter Hungerford (later Baron Hungerford), Speaker of the House of Commons and Steward of the Household of King Henry V. By 1444, it was known as \\"Hungerford Inn\\". Walter Hungerford's grandson, Robert Hungerford, 3rd Baron Hungerford, and great-grandson, Thomas Hungerford, Speaker of the Commons, were both attainted for supporting the Lancastrian cause during the Wars of the Roses, in 1461 and 1469 respectively. King Henry VII granted the land back to Thomas's brother, Walter Hungerford. His daughter-in law, Agnes Hungerford, was hanged at Tyburn in 1523, for the murder of her first husband John Cotell. His grandson, also Walter, was accused in 1540 of treason and perversion, and King Henry VIII had him executed alongside his patron Thomas Cromwell. His son, another Walter, was regranted the property in 1544. It finally passed down the family to Sir Edward Hungerford (1632‚Äì1711), created a Knight of the Order of the Bath at the coronation of Charles II. First market \\"Old Hungerford Market (from a view published in 1805)\\". The bust of Sir Edward Hungerford (d.1711) is visible set high into the north wall.Position in north wall as stated in Edward Walford, 1878, p.131 Engraving by R.C.

Latin inscription: Forum utilitate publicae per quem necessarium Regia Caroli (Secun)di annuente Majestatae propriis sumptibus erexit perfecitq(ue) D(ominus) Edoardus Hungerford Balnei Miles anno MDCLXXXII (\\"This market for the use of the public, with the royal consent of His Majesty Charles the Second, Lord Edward Hungerford, Knight of the Bath, erected and completed at his own expense in the year 1682\\") Sir Edward Hungerford (d.1711) obtained permission to hold a market on the site for three days a week. Hungerford Inn, or seemingly the burned-out remains of it, was subdivided into shops and with a covered piazza, formed the market. The market never prospered and Hungerford sold the site in parcels to the politician Sir Stephen Fox between 1681 and 1684, and Sir Christopher Wren bought a quarter of the property, and a quarter of the rents. In 1685 Fox and Wren obtained a license to sell grain, but achieved little increase in trade. A market house was built in the centre of the site, possibly designed by Wren himself. Hungerford squandered his money, dying a poor Knight of Windsor in 1711. In 1718 the market was sold to the royal gardener Henry Wise and remained in his family until 1830, when it was bought by the newly formed Hungerford Market Company. New market By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the old market had become dilapidated. In 1830 an Act of Parliament was obtained to incorporate a company to re-establish the market. The company acquired the site of the old market, together with the adjoining houses in Hungerford street, and a few in the Strand. All the existing buildings were demolished, and a new structure was built in 1831-3 to an Italianate design by Charles Fowler, the architect of Covent Garden Market. The building contract was the first undertaken by the partnership of Grissell and Peto, who later went on to build Nelson's Column, the Reform Club, and the Lyceum Theatre, The buildings were mostly of granite. The area occupied by the new market was a strip 126 feet wide, extending 465 feet northward towards the Strand. In addition, next to the river, was a wharf, about 200 feet long, with steps down to the water. The market itself was divided into three sections. The lower level of the site was occupied by a fish market, consisting of an open court, 130 feet long, with two tiers of colonnaded galleries on each side. By 1830 the replacement of Old London Bridge meant that fishing boats could then come further upstream to deliver their catch, and the company hoped to break the monopoly of Billingsgate Market by providing a more convenient supply of fish for the West End. Fowler later built an iron roof over the open court to protect the fishmongers' stalls and two end pavilions towards the river were used as taverns. At the northern end of this lower court a flight of steps led to the upper level, which was elevated over storage vaults. The Great Hall, an aisled timber-roofed building 160 feet long, housed a fruit and vegetable market. To the north of that was another open court, flanked by colonnades and butchers' shops. New Hungerford Street led from there into the Strand. Fowler exploited the complexities of the site for dramatic effect, leading Thomas Leverton Donaldson to talk of \\"the playful picturesqueness of the group, where court rose above court, galleries above galleries, and where the series of roofs outtopped each other.\\" A suspension bridge leading to the market from Lambeth on the south bank of the River Thames was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1845, and a hall for lectures, named Hungerford Hall, was built next-door in 1851. In the same year of 1851, the Swiss-Italian entrepreneur Carlo Gatti opened a stand at the market selling pastries and ice cream, priced at one penny and served in a shell. This was perhaps the first time that ice cream was made available to the paying general public. Demolition The market found itself unable to challenge more specialist markets, such as Billingsgate, and Covent Garden, and was badly damaged when Hungerford Hall burned down in 1854. It was sold to the South Eastern Railway in 1862 which demolished it to make way for Charing Cross railway station, which opened on 11 January 1864. Brunel's suspension bridge was replaced with the new nine- span Hungerford Railway Bridge, and its chains were re-used to complete the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. Vestiges The Hungerford family are commemorated in the name of the Hungerford Bridge, which leads into Charing Cross from the south bank of the River Thames.

Pinne started working as a television executive for the Reg Grundy organisation. Firstly, as Head of Production from 1980, later rising to become a Senior Vice President of the company. During this period, he worked on numerous shows including The Young Doctors, The Restless Years and Neighbours. He also co-composed the theme tune to Sons and Daughters. In 1992, he was responsible for overseeing the production of Dangerous Women, an American series based loosely on the popular Prisoner. The show was not a huge success running to only 52 one-hour episodes. He also travelled to a number of Latin American countries where he was responsible for overseeing the production of local versions of some of Grundy's most successful hits. He left the Grundy organisation in the late 1990s in order to set up his own record label, Bayview, with fellow former Australian television producer, Don Battye and now writes and composes music. He currently resides in the Brisbane area of Australia. Stage musicals Since the late 1950s, Peter Pinne (variously working in collaboration with Don Battye, Ray Kolle and/or John-Michael Howson has been one of the most prolific creators of original Australian stage musicals. Examples include: *All Saint's Day (1960) ‚Äì based around Australian Rules Football *Don't tell Helena (1962) ‚Äì the misadventures of a society girl employed by a department store *A Bunch of Ratbags (1966) ‚Äì a rock musical set in the 1950s, adapted from the novel by William Dick *It happened in Tanjablanca (1968); later revised as Red, White and Boogie (1974) ‚Äì a murder mystery set in the 1940s *The Computer/Love's Travelling Salesman (1970) ‚Äì a double bill of one-act \\"pop operas\\" *Caroline (1971) ‚Äì based on the life of Caroline Chisholm *Sweet Fanny Adams (1974) ‚Äì the story of two rival whorehouses in 1930s Sydney *A bit o' petticoat (1984) ‚Äì based on The Torrents by Australian playwright Oriel Gray *Pyjamas in Paradise (2005) ‚Äì based on the popular \\"pyjama parties\\" held in Surfers Paradise in the 1950s *Suddenly Single (2007) Most of these musicals were originally performed as amateur or semi-professional productions. Although private demonstration recordings of the scores exist, few of the shows had commercial cast albums released. A song from A Bunch of Ratbags was released as a single, cover versions of two songs from The Computer and Love's Travelling Salesman were included on a 1970 compilation LP Australian Musicals Now, and a studio recording of selections from Red, White and Boogie and Sweet Fanny Adams was released in 1983 on Don Battye's Trigpoint label. The only stage production to generate a complete original cast recording was Caroline; the original LP was released in 1971 and subsequently re-issued on CD (by London-based label Dress Circle Records) in 1998. Although all of Pinne's musicals were successful in their original productions, few of them have been mounted since. A Bunch of Ratbags was revived in 2005 by Magnormos, which resulted in the release of a \\"premiere\\" cast recording. In 2007, Magnormos staged a 30-minute workshop production of Pinne's latest musical, Suddenly Single, which was written in collaboration with Paul Dellit. In the mid-1990s, Pinne and Battye also wrote a stage musical adaptation of the cult 1970s Australian television series, Prisoner: Cell Block H. The show was first produced in England (where the original series had become more popular than in Australia), in a lavish West End production that starred Lily Savage and original TV cast member Maggie Kirkpatrick, reprising her role as Joan \\"The Freak\\" Ferguson.  Pantomime  In addition, Pinne and Battye co-wrote a number of pantomime-like musicals especially for children, which were produced at the Alexander Theatre at Monash University during the 1970s. Mostly based on popular fairy tales, these shows included: *The Shoemaker and the Elves (1975) *Jack and the Beanstalk (1976) *Billabong Bill' (1976) *The Little Tin Soldier (1977) *The Emperor's New Clothes (1978) *Rumpelstiltskin *Beauty and the Beast Books *Australian performers, Australian performances : a discography from film, TV, theatre, radio and concert, 1897‚Äì1985 (1987) ()  ReferencesExternal links * Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Australian composers Category:Australian male composers Category:Australian soap opera writers Category:People from Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian musical theatre composers Category:Male television writers ","title":"Peter Pinne"},{"id":"10438905","title":"Young Chris"},{"id":"10438909","text":"Barry Jones (born 30 June 1970) is an English former footballer.

He was the Chief of Defence 1994-2001, and Chairman of the European Union Military Committee 2001‚Äì2004. Career H√§gglund's father was General Woldemar H√§gglund, commander of the Karelian Front in the Second World War. He was born in Viipuri, an area ceded to the Soviet Union in the Second World War. Despite his Swedish-speaking family background, Finnish language immersion was total in his youth, and he ultimately had to learn Swedish at school. He was educated not only at the Cadet School in Finland, but also attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College in Leavenworth, Kansas. He is also a fellow of Harvard University. H√§gglund commanded United Nations troops in 1978‚Äì1979 as the commander of the Finnish battalion (FINBATT) in UNEF II in Sinai, as the commander of UNDOF in Golan in 1985‚Äì1986, and as the commander of UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon in 1986‚Äì88. H√§gglund served under Presidents Martti Ahtisaari and briefly under Tarja Halonen. H√§gglund's command of the defence forces was characterised by the general modernisation of the force and refocusing from quantity to quality. In the Army, three large \\"readiness brigades\\" were formed, and the Air Force upgraded to Hornet F/A-18 fighters. Finland entered NATO's Partnership for Peace programme under H√§gglund's command. A major change was made in the terms of conscription service: reserve officers and NCOs would serve 12 months (lengthened from 11 months), but rank and file would serve 6 months (shortened from 8 months), with some specialists such as military police serving 9 months. Previously the rotation had been thrice per year, in order to maintain a contingent that had been trained at least 4 months. The rotation was changed to twice per year. Within the military, H√§gglund was also a strong proponent of peacekeeping operations, worked to improve their appreciation and opined that officers should necessarily participate. Since Finnish law requires that all participants are volunteers, this brought him into conflict with the officers' union, whose opinion was that peacekeeping experience could not be a requirement for career advancement. Officer training went through a major improvement due to his actions. The cadet school was promoted to university status as the Finnish National Defence University, and degrees formalised. He has published three books, one concerning the defence of Finland, one about the defence of Europe and an autobiography. In the 2000s, H√§gglund promoted the development of the independent defence of Europe, and took the view that the United States would shift its focus away from Europe, changing the role of NATO.

The club currently competes in Gamma Ethniki, the 3rd league of Greek football. It is the most historic team in Volos, according to the fans of the club, since it holds 26 local, (really local), titles in its potential, hence the only 5.5 entries in the First National Division. History Niki Volos was founded on 19 August 1924 as Gymnastic Club of Volos' Refugees or Refugee Gymnastic Association, by Greek refugees who came from Asia Minor. Niki participated for the first time in the championship of the first category before the establishment of the First National, as in 1953‚Äì54 she was the winner of the Northern Group and this gave her the ticket for the final phase of the National Division Championship 1953‚Äì54, Six teams (Athens (2) ‚Äì Piraeus ‚Äì Thessaloniki ‚Äì North ‚Äì South) took the 5th place with 16 points, ahead of Panahaiki, who finished the championship with 13. Niki won for the first time in the 1961 Men's National Soccer Championship, where she had 5 appearances in the big league. In 1966 it was devalued to the Beta Ethniki and since then it has been trying to regain its rise to the big category, which eventually succeeded 48 years later, in 2014‚Äì15. In 1976 he won the Amateur Cup. In recent years he has been fighting in the Beta Ethniki Championship and in the 2006‚Äì07 season he finished last and deferred to the Third National. In the 2012‚Äì13 season he was back in the Beta Ethniki Championship, and in the following year (2013‚Äì14) after the play- offs he won the first place that led to the Super League after 48 years of absence. Unfortunately, on 10 December 2014, the club of Thessaly left the championship due to the inability of the administration to cover the financial obligations that had been created, leaving all the players that belonged to its staff to be released as free. From 2015 he competes in the Gamma Ethniki. Crest and colours Old crest until 2015 Niki Volos crest displays the goddess Nike as depicted in the statue Winged Victory of Samothrace. The image of the goddess was the original emblem of the Smyrna-based athletic club Panionios, one of the most popular Greek athletic clubs of Ionia, before it was uprooted and re-established in Athens after the Greco-Turkish War. The founding members of Niki Volou FC, many of them refugees from Smyrna (now Izmir) and the surrounding region, decided to restore the emblem as part of their new club.

It was formerly a baseball stadium, home to the Montreal Expos (now Washington Nationals), from 1969 to 1976. The Expos were Major League Baseball's first Canadian franchise. It served as a temporary home (for eight seasons) until the domed Olympic Stadium was finished and made available to the Expos. The ballpark was typically called simply (and inaccurately, since the stadium was built within the larger park) \\"Jarry Park\\" or Parc Jarry. The stadium hosted two National Football League preseason games in 1969; August 25 (Detroit Lions vs Boston Patriots) and September 11 (New York Giants vs Pittsburgh Steelers). The stadium originally began as a baseball field in Montreal's north end (Villeray) in a public park known as Jarry Park. The only structure was the small unroofed grandstand behind the home plate and backstop area, with seating for approximately 3,000 people. 2015, Former Baseball Backstop grandstand evident History (1960-present) The scoreboard at Jarry Park Stadium, 1969 Before Jarry Park Stadium, Montreal's main baseball stadium was Delorimier Stadium, the longtime home of the Montreal Royals. The diamond at Jarry Park had simply hosted youth baseball on a field in the park. However, in early 1960 the Montreal Royals were dropped by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an affiliate. Jackie Robinson Montreal Royals jersey Looking to improve facilities for a stadium in Montreal, the 3,000 seat Jarry Park Stadium was built, formally opening in August 1960. After the Dodgers ended their affiliation with the Royals, potential new owners of the team had an option on the franchise, with the provision that a suitable ballpark is put in place. Unable to negotiate an agreement to play at the aging Delorimier Stadium, the group looked to spacious Jarry Park as the alternate site. The Jarry Park Stadium was built for this reason. However, even after the construction, the Royals franchise relocated to Syracuse, New York in 1960. When the original baseball field was later approved for the Expos, it was renovated to a park approaching major league standards. Unroofed extensions were built from the original stands to the left and right field corners, a large bleacher section was constructed across the left field, and a scoreboard was built behind the right-field fence. This work brought the stadium's capacity to 28,500, and the park was approved as the Expos temporary home. Features and dimensions Beyond the right field fence was a pre-existing swimming pool in the city park. Long before the \\"splash hits\\" at Oracle Park in San Francisco and PNC Park in Pittsburgh, there were occasional \\"splash hits\\" here. The first and most famous was a blast by Willie Stargell on July 23, 1969‚Äîleading locals to call the pool \\"Willie's pool\\" (French: la piscine de Willie). One of those was hit by Willie McCovey during a 6-4 win over the Expos on August 24, 1969. The idea of the swimming pool itself was later replicated in Chase Field in Phoenix. The stadium was rather sparse, given that it was intended to be only a temporary home for a maximum of four years. The clubhouses were located along the left-field line behind the stands. Due to its orientation, games in April and September frequently started with the setting sun shining right in the faces of first basemen. Eventually, it was decided to delay games until the sun finished setting. It was completely exposed to the elements, which was a particular problem at the beginning and end of the season, given Montreal's long winters. There was a huge gap between the left-field bleachers and the third-base grandstands, resulting in second basemen and shortstops getting buffeted by cold winds early and late in the season. The Expos frequently had to postpone early and late-season games because there was no protection for the fans. Even allowing for its temporary status, the field conditions were among the worst in the majors. Although the center field distance was posted as , it was actually to straightaway center, and to the deep left and right center field corners. Montreal Expos In their first expansion since 1962, Major League Baseball added four new franchises for the 1969 season. Along with San Diego, Seattle and Kansas City, Montreal was granted a Major League franchise. This marked the first time a team was located outside of the United States. Montreal, Canada's largest city at the time, had a strong tradition with minor league baseball, as the Montreal Royals were a long time Dodgers farm team. Jackie Robinson had played for the Royals in 1946, before his promotion to the Dodgers in 1947, breaking the color barrier. Icon Roberto Clemente was another Montreal Royal player, as were Dodgers legends Duke Snider, Don Drysdale, Roy Campanella and Tommy Lasorda. At the time the major league expansion announcement was made, Montreal had just hosted the 1967 World's Fair, called Expo '67, opened a new subway system and submitted (and eventually won) an international bid to host the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. Owner Charles Bronfman called the new franchise the Expos (after the World's Fair) and hired Gene Mauch as Manager. When the Expos were announced as an expansion franchise in 1967, one condition for placing an MLB franchise in Montreal was that a domed stadium‚Äîthought to be a must due to Montreal's harsh winter weather‚Äîbe in place for the 1972 season. Finding a site for the Expos to play until that time proved to be a challenge. Delorimier Stadium was ruled out because its location made it impossible to expand beyond its 20,000-seat capacity (it was eventually demolished in 1971). Other options were the Autostade from a World's fair which had inspired the new club's nickname. However, the city balked at the cost of adding a dome and 12,000 seats, and the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes demanded onerous rent. The Expos were now in a bind‚Äîif they did not find another site quickly, the National League would strip Montreal of its franchise and award it to Buffalo, which already had a suitable stadium in place. In August 1968, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau persuaded National League President Warren Giles to visit Jarry Park (Parc Jarry). Giles liked the site's location‚Äîless than a mile from a highway and 200 yards from a commuter railroad. After settling in at Jarry Park Stadium, a strike delayed the original 1972 completion of a domed stadium. Due to further delays and cost overruns, the Expos wound up playing eight seasons in Jarry Park. After Montreal was selected in 1970 to host the 1976 Summer Olympic Games, the stadium projects of the baseball team and of the Summer Olympic Games merged. When it became apparent that Olympic Stadium would not be ready in time, the Expos were forced to seek permission from MLB to stay at Jarry Park Stadium for one more season. Further construction delays eventually forced the Expos to repeat the process until Olympic Stadium was finally ready for baseball for the 1977 season. For a time during the 1976‚Äì77 offseason, it looked like the Expos would have to open the 1977 season at Jarry Park due to delays in securing a lease at Olympic Stadium; indeed, the Expos began selling 1977 season tickets under the assumption they would have to play at Jarry. However, an agreement was finally reached in early 1977, allowing the Expos to open 1977 at the new Olympic Stadium.Costello, Rory. Olympic Stadium (Montreal). Society for American Baseball Research, 2013. On the field, the Expos finished 52-110 in their first year. They improved over the years, winning over 70 games in 1970, 1971 and 1972 and came close to the .500 mark in both 1973 and 1974. Their most popular player during the Jarry Park era was Rusty Staub, nicknamed \\"le Grand Orange.\\" Other players of note at Jarry Park were: Maury Wills, Willie Davis, Ron Fairly, Carl Morton, Ken Singleton and Ron Hunt. Future Hall of Famer Gary Carter debuted in 1974 at age 20. Warren Cromartie, Steve Rogers, Larry Parrish, Ellis Valentine and the great Andre Dawson were all young Expos who played their debut seasons at Jarry Park. The Washington Nationals honored Jarry Park during the 50th- anniversary celebration of their franchise at Nationals Park July 6, 2019, by replicating the Expos' original scoreboard.

The Buffalo Bisons (Class AAA; International League) played 13 home games in Jarry Park. September 29, 1971: Batting against Milt Pappas of the Chicago Cubs, Ron Hunt was hit by a pitch for the 50th time during the season. The Expos won, 6-5, on Hunt's game-winning single in the ninth inning. May 9, 1972: Willie Mays plays in his final game as a member of the San Francisco Giants. As a pinch-hitter, he gets a single in the ninth inning of a 7-1 Giants' loss to the Expos. September 9, 1973: A year and a half following his last appearance as a member of the San Francisco Giants, Willie Mays plays the final regular-season game of his career as the Mets defeated the Expos, 3-0, despite 13 Montreal hits. September 15, 1973: A crowd of 34,331 (the largest ever at Jarry Park Stadium) watches the Expos defeat the Philadelphia Phillies, 5-4. Bob Bailey singles home Ron Woods with the winning run in the 10th inning. September 28, 1974: Gary Carter hits his first major league home run off Phillies' pitcher Steve Carlton. The Expos win, 3-1. September 26, 1976: In the last baseball games played at Stade Parc Jarry, the Phillies won both games of a doubleheader, 4-1 and 2-1 (the second game shortened to seven innings due to rain), over the Expos. The win in the first game gave the Phils' their first National League East Division title. Stade Jarry, 2006 The site today The stadium was used for various civic events in the years after the Expos. The Inter-Montreal soccer team of Canadian Professional Soccer League (CSPL) played at Jarry. Jarry Park Stadium was gradually converted into a tennis stadium, beginning in 1980, with one corner of the court located at the old backstop. The stadium was renamed in honor of Pope John Paul II to mark his visit to Montreal and the park on September 11, 1984. The venue was renamed Du Maurier Stadium in 1987. It has since been upgraded and renamed again, most recently as Stade IGA. Today, Jarry Park contains baseball diamonds, soccer, cricket, bocce, basketball and beach volleyball grounds, pitches and zones, swimming pools and playgrounds, a dog run, and two gazebos. In winter a pond is swept to make a skating rink.

Australia were playing England in the first Test, and were in trouble at the end of the first day, at a score of 232/8, with Dennis Lillee not out.Cricinfo - 1st Test: Australia v England at Perth, Dec 14-19, 1979 When the second day of play began, Lillee emerged onto the field carrying not the traditional willow bat, but a cricket bat made from aluminium. The bat, manufactured by the company of Lillee's good friend Graeme Monaghan, was intended only as a cheap replacement for traditional cricket bats for schools and developing countries. Nevertheless, Lillee decided to use it in the Test match as a marketing stunt, and at that point, there were no rules against using such a bat. This was not the first time Lillee had used an aluminium bat, as he had employed one 12 days previously in a Test against the West Indies without incident. The trouble began on the fourth ball of the day, when Lillee straight drove a ball from Ian Botham. The ball went for three runs, and nothing appeared untoward. However, Australian captain Greg Chappell thought that the ball should have gone for a four, and instructed twelfth man Rodney Hogg to deliver a conventional wooden bat to Lillee. As this was happening, English captain Mike Brearley complained to umpires Max O'Connell and Don Weser that the metallic bat was damaging the soft, leather cricket ball. Although the umpires told Lillee he had to change his bat, Lillee instructed Hogg that he wasn't going to, and assumed a posture to face the next delivery. Brearley, Lillee and the umpires held an animated discussion for almost ten minutes, before Chappell decided that the game would be held up if things continued. He emerged onto the ground, took one of the willow bats from Hogg, and instructed Lillee to be quiet and use the bat; Lillee threw his aluminium bat away in disgust (\\"throwing the offending lump of metal fully 40 yards towards the pavilion\\"),The 10 most spectacular dismissals  Special reports  The Observer and grudgingly took the wooden bat. Lillee was not censured or disciplined for this incident; both the umpires and the Australian Cricket Board decided to let Lillee off with only a warning. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that Lillee's \\" 'unsavoury' behaviour partly overshadowed other individual performances more in keeping with the spirit of the game\\", and commented \\"The incident served only to blacken Lillee's reputation and damage the image of the game as well as, eventually, the Australian authorities because of their reluctance to take effective disciplinary action\\".Cricinfo After the game, sales of the bat skyrocketed for a few months, with Monaghan giving Lillee a small cut of the profits. This lasted for only a few months before the Laws of cricket were amended to state that the blade of the bat was to be made of wood (Law 5). The actual bat that Lillee used is still in his possession; after the match ended, he had it signed by both teams. Brearley, realising a sales stunt when he saw one, simply signed the bat \\"Good luck with the sales\\". The match itself was described by Wisden as \\"enthralling\\" and ended with only 14.4 overs remaining in the last day's play, with Geoff Boycott carrying his own wooden bat through the innings and ending marooned on 99 not out. Australia won the match by 138 runs.

A 10K Walk Through German-Texas Heritage in Austin, Texas. The University of Texas at Austin. 3/6. Retrieved on November 15, 2009. German Texan () is both a term to describe immigrants who arrived in the Republic of Texas from Germany from the 1830s onward and an ethnic category that includes their descendants in today's state of Texas. The arriving Germans tended to cluster in ethnic enclaves; the majority settled in a broad, fragmented belt across the south-central part of the state, where many became farmers. As of 1990, about three million Texans considered themselves at least part German in ancestry, a subgroup of German Americans.  History  Sauer- Beckmann Living History Farm Emigration in force began during the period of the Republic of Texas (1836‚Äì1846) following the establishment in 1842 of the Adelsverein (Verein zum Schutze deutscher Einwanderer, Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas) by a group of Germans dedicated to colonizing Texas. The Adelsverein helped establish German colonies throughout the state, including purchasing the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant, some 5000 square miles between the Colorado and Llano Rivers. In 1847, John O. Meusebach, acting as commissioner of the Adelsverein, negotiated the Meusebach‚ÄìComanche Treaty to settle German colonists on the land grant. It remains the only unbroken treaty between European-American colonists and Native Americans. A large portion of the early settlers following statehood were Forty-Eighters, emigres from the Revolutions of 1848, who dispersed into areas of Central Texas. After generations, German Texans spoke what became known as Texas German (), a German language dialect that was tied to the historic period of highest immigration. In Germany, the language developed differently from how it did among the relatively isolated ethnic colony in the US. The dialect has largely died out since the First and Second World Wars, as have many US German dialects. After a period of ethnic activism during the 1850s, the Civil War, and Reconstruction, the Germans lived in relative obscurity as teachers, doctors, civil servants, politicians, musicians, farmers, and ranchers. They founded the towns of Bulverde, New Braunfels, Fredericksburg, Boerne, and Comfort in Texas Hill Country, and Schulenburg, Walburg, and Weimar to the east. German-American cultural institutions in Texas include the Sophienburg Museum in New Braunfels, the Pioneer Museum in Fredericksburg, the Witte- Schmid Haus Museum in Austin County, the German-Texan Heritage Society, and the Texas German Society.

Sobol, a brilliant computer programmer and CTO of Cyberstorm Entertainment, a Daemon is activated. Sobol, dying of brain cancer, was fearful for humanity and began to envision a new world order. The Daemon becomes his tool to achieve that vision. The Daemon's first mission is to kill two programmers Joseph Pavlos & Chopra Singh who worked for CyberStorm Entertainment and unknowingly helped in the creation of the Daemon. The program secretly takes over hundreds of companies and provides financial and computing resources for recruiting real world agents and creating AutoM8s (computer controlled driverless cars, used as transport and occasionally as weapons), Razorbacks (sword-wielding robotic riderless motorcycles, specifically designed as weapons) and other devices. The Daemon also creates a secondary online web service, hidden from the general public, dubbed the Darknet, which allows Daemon operatives to exchange information freely. Daemon implements a kind of government by algorithm inside the community of its recruited operatives. What follows is a series of interlocking stories following the main characters: Detective Pete Sebeck is called in to investigate the death of Pavlos. However, when a connection is made between the two programmers and Cyberstorm, the FBI takes over led by Agent Decker. For being the first authority figure in the investigation, the Daemon selects Sebeck against his will to serve the Daemon, which frames Sebeck for its creation as a multi-million scheme and a hoax. The US government, though knowing the truth, fasttracks Sebeck's trial and executes him eight months later. Sebeck makes peace with his wife, who loves him despite Sebeck's having an affair, but his son Chris remains estranged, and he proclaims his innocence while dying from lethal injection. However, Sebeck later awakens to learn that the Daemon faked his death and assigned him the task to prove that humanity deserves its freedom from the Daemon. Joined by a fellow operative named Laney Price, Sebeck vanishes into America. Jon Ross, a Russian hacker and identity thief, is questioned by the FBI and brought into the investigation by Sebeck. Unfortunately, traditional investigation methods are useless against Sobol's Daemon program. Ross eventually deduces that the Daemon can anticipate their every move, seemingly one step ahead of anyone who tries to interfere with its operation. Even after being named in the Daemon hoax (and put on the FBI's most wanted list), Ross willingly helps the US government to stop the program. Assigned to the NSA's anti-Daemon task force, with Agent Phillips, he is a firsthand witness to Loki's attack on the installation and barely survives the massacre that follows. With his immunity deal rescinded, he vanishes underground with the intent on destroying the Daemon on his own. Agent Roy \\"Tripwire\\" Merritt a decorated FBI agent is brought in to secure Sobol's property, when several FBI agents and police officers are killed by an automated Hummer that attacks anyone who approaches. A longtime military officer and expert in hostage situations, he realizes that Sobol's estate is a death trap and red herring, but fear of the Daemon forces his hand and his team is ordered to secure the site regardless. His team is quickly killed, and he remains the lone survivor, infiltrating the house and accidentally triggering a bomb, which levels the property. Blamed for the failure, he is relieved of duty but is later brought onto the anti-Daemon task force by the Major. When Loki is revealed to have infiltrated the building, Roy pursues him, against orders. Fearful of the publicity that the chase will generate, the Major kills Roy himself. Despite being an enemy to the Daemon, he becomes a folk hero of the Darknet, known as \\"The Burning Man\\" by the Darknet users, who respect him for his tenacity.

Eventually, she is placed in charge of the anti-Daemon task force, but she finds plenty of interference from the Major. She is attracted to Jon Ross (the attraction is mutual), but she quickly states that national security will take precedence and their relationship will remain professional. Phillips objects to the murder of Sebeck to protect infected corporate systems from the Daemon's wrath. One of a handful survivors from Loki's attack, Phillips is blamed for the failure and relieved of duties. Brian Gragg aka \\"Loki Stormbringer\\" is a sociopathic loner and avid gamer. He makes a living through identity theft and other cyber crimes. After running afoul of some hackers from the Philippines, he allows his partner in crime, Jason Heider, to be killed in his place. Needing to lie low, Loki is recruited by the Daemon by outthinking a hidden game level in one of Sobol's games. Loki is the first Daemon operative and quickly becomes one of the most powerful operatives. His behavior, though useful to the Daemon, is hated and feared even by other Darknet members. His first major act is to infiltrate the anti- Daemon task force. When found out, he quickly triggers an attack, which leaves most of the people and agents there dead. He is pursued by Roy Merritt, as he escapes and witnesses the Major executing Roy, vowing to kill the Major for betraying his own man. The Major, unnamed throughout the series, is introduced as a secret DOD liaison assigned to the daemon task force. Soon, everyone who encounters him realizes that his history is checkered, and his loyalty remains with the military-industrial complex now under attack by the Daemon. When Loki massacres the task force, he quickly contains the situation by destroying all evidence (including leveling the building) and personally executing Roy Merritt, fearful that Merritt's pursuit of Loki will attract too much attention. Realizing that they have underestimated the Daemon and its network, the Major retreats and prepares to wage a secret war against the Daemon and its agents. Anji Anderson is a recently fired reporter, whose good looks have hindered her career for years. Having been relegated to fluff pieces and put on the air to be pretty, she is quickly recruited as a Daemon operative, her job to investigate stories that benefit the Daemon and help push its propaganda. Her main effect in the story is to help frame Sebeck. She eventually becomes the spokesman for the Daemon. Charles Mosely is a former drug dealer and convicted killer recruited by the Daemon, which helps him to escape prison by transferring him first to minimum security and then releasing him altogether. With a new identity, he travels to a Daemon-controlled office where he is interrogated by the Daemon's AI and is deemed acceptable to serve. He eventually becomes a security operative, assigned jobs such as executing criminals, participating a massive worldwide assassination of spammers who corrupt the internet. Mosley's only request is for the Daemon to locate his missing son and protect him. Ray is both found and sent to live with Daemon agents, who will raise and educate Ray in a safe family-like setting.

Settlements There are only three settlements on Agistri - Milos (Megalochori), Skala and Limenaria. Milos (pop. 566) is the main village where the majority of the Greek population of the island lives. Skala (pop. 448) is a twenty-minute walk from Milos along the coastal road. Skala is where most of the tourist facilities and hotels are. Limenaria (pop. 128) is a very small village on the other side of the island with very little tourism. The island's population is 1,142 inhabitants according to the 2011 Greek census. Its land area is . Geography Agistri is a pine-covered island in the Saronic Islands group. Agistri is very close to the larger Saronic island of Aegina. The island can be reached from Aegina by a number of boats in just ten minutes. These boats include the Agistri Express and a number of small \\"water taxis\\". The island is also an hour's boat ride from the large Athenian port of Piraeus.  Flora and fauna  Agistri is home to a wide variety of plants such as wild cyclamen, thyme, caper bushes, and thistles. The center of the island is covered in Pine forest. It hosts a population of chukar partridges. The rocky eastern coast is used as a breeding place by swifts. Noteworthy is a population of peafowls, which have been introduced to the island and since become feral.  Local economies  Agistri's primary industry is tourism. Both in Skala and Megalochori there are numerous hotels and restaurants. Local transport includes a bus and taxis. Popular beaches are Aponissos and Dragonera on the western coast, the beaches of Megalochori and Skala in the north, Mariza in the south, and Skliri and Halikiada in the east. Halikiada is popular for naturism. The island also has a long history of free camping, though it is no longer allowed to erect tents in the forest due to fire hazard. Agriculture also forms part of the island's economy. On 18 September 2015, Wall Street investor Brian Kelly announced he would be investing in the Nxt-based platform Drachmae, which has as its aim the revitalisation of the local economy of the Greek Island Agistri.

Known for discovering the cause of ataxic tropical neuropathy, he was a founding member of the Pan African Association of Neurological Sciences and an early advocate and researcher on tropical neurology. Education He had his primary and secondary education at the Holy Trinity School, Ilawe Ekiti, the Emmanuel School, Ado Ekiti and Christ's School Ado Ekiti. After, finishing his secondary education, he studied medicine at the University College, Ibadan when it was still affiliated to the University of London. Research and career In 1963, he was invited by Prof Harold Scarborough to spend a year at the Welsh National School of Medicine in Cardiff.Independent (newspaper) obituary of B O Osuntokun 19 Sept 1995 He joined the research staff of the University College, Ibadan in 1964, as a medical research fellow. However, upon gaining a Smith and Nephew fellowship, he went abroad for further studies under the direction of Henry Miller and John Walton, both eminent neurologists in Newcastle upon Tyne. After spending some time in Newcastle, he took a job at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queens Square, London before returning to Nigeria in 1965. It was at the University of Ibadan he launched a productive career, working on neuro-epidemiology and clinical and investigative neurology especially the study of dementia among Nigerians and African Americans. In the late 1960s, he investigated cases of ataxic neuropathy in Epe where residents usually consume a dose of ill processed cassava with little or no supplement. He then mapped out the epidemiology of the neuropathy and was able to study the basic aspects of the neuropathy. He discovered the disease was due to cyanide intoxication. At the time, little was done beyond clinical attention to the disease. His success in discovering the basis of tropical ataxic neuropathy earned him local and international acclaim in the medical community. Throughout his career, he wrote a number of scholarly works on his prodigious research on tropical epidemiology and was also Dean of Medicine at the University of Ibadan and later the Chief Medical Officer of that university's teaching hospital, UCH. He died in 1995 and was buried in his native Okemesi, Ekiti State. The onset of neuropathy after ingestion of ill-processed Cassava, due to Cyanide Intoxication, is known as the Osuntokun's Sign, and is commonly used in African Medical Lectures and Bulletins, but is not much known to countries outside Africa.

He wrote several books on the themes of Chinese religions, customs and social life, and missionary work. Biography Nevius was born on a farm halfway between the villages of Lodi and Ovid in the \\"Lake country\\" of western New York state. It was an idyllic country location surrounded by fields and meadows with a nearby spring of pure water, and Lake Seneca, \\"gleaming through the trees\\", only 2 miles distant; he was the son of Benjamin Nevius, of Dutch descent, and his wife Mary Denton. He was educated at the college in Ovid, then at Union College in Schenectady, then, from 1850, at Princeton as a prospective minister in the Presbyterian Church.Creegan, 1903, pp. 200-212. In 1853, Nevius married Helen Coan and, on June 15 of that year, the couple set off, as missionaries, on an arduous 6-month sea voyage to Ningpo, in the Che-Kiang province of China, arriving in the spring of 1854. He and his wife immediately set about learning the language, and Nevius's subsequent interest in the phenomenon of spirit possession was sparked off by conversations about the supernatural with his language tutor, Mr. Tu; the Chinese had a strong belief in the reality and power of the spirit world that was part of an animistic tradition going back thousands of years (see Chinese folk religion).Nevius, Demon Possession, 1894, p. IV & 9. The Revd. and Mrs. Nevius were soon travelling and preaching, as well as setting up missions and schools, studying and writing. In 1861 the couple moved to Shantung province, where most of their Chinese missionary work would be undertaken. They spent some time in Tung Chow and dispensed medicine to the locals during the 1862 cholera epidemic there. John also trained missionaries and helped to establish the country's first Synod which took place in Shanghai in 1870, while Mrs. Nevius set up a boarding school for girls. In 1871, they moved to Cheefoo and built a house there called \\"Nan Lou\\". In 1873, John embarked on a taxing 600-mile missionary tour by foot, finding rest and sustenance at whatever establishments he could find along the way. In 1877, there was a famine in the province of Shantung (the \\"Great North China Famine\\"), and he played a pivotal role in raising funds, setting up a food distribution centre and organising a relief corps from quarters at Kao- Yai. Famine struck again in 1889, and Nevius's abilities were, once more, called upon. Nevius continued with his missionary work to country areas until 1887, travelling thousands of miles, often under arduous conditions of terrain, weather etc. In 1890, he travelled to Korea and, although he stayed for only 2 weeks, his \\"Nevius Plan\\" (see below) was subsequently adopted and led to rapid growth of the church there.David L. Larsen. The Company of the Preachers (Kregel Publications, 1998) p. 523. He died suddenly, at home, in October 1893, and was buried in the cemetery at Chefoo. Nevius was the author of several books covering the subjects of Chinese religions, spiritual practices and social and political life, spirit possession and missionary work; his wife also wrote an exhaustive biography (see bibliography).  Indigenous Church Mission  After questioning the methods of western missionaries of his time, Nevius took up the Venn-Anderson principles of \\"self-propagation, self-government, and self-supporting\\" in a series of articles in the Chinese Recorder journal in 1885, which was later published as a book in 1886, The Planting and Development of Missionary Churches. Nevius called for discarding old-style missions and the adoption of his new plan to foster an independent, self-supporting local church. He criticized the missionaries' practice of paying national workers out of mission funds, believing the healthy local church should be able to support its own local workers.  The Nevius Plan  The missionary principles formulated by Nevius later became known as the \\"Nevius Plan\\", and were a development of the existing ideas of Henry Venn and Rufus Anderson.Ung Kyu Pak. Millennialism in the Korean Protestant Church (Peter Lang, 2005) p. 96. When American Presbyterians began their work in Korea, the new missionaries invited Nevius to advise them. Embracing his method, the Korean mission enjoyed great success, although it did not gain similar popularity in China. The Nevius Plan outlined the following: # Christians should continue to live in their neighborhoods and pursue their occupations, being self-supporting and witnessing to their co-workers and neighbors. # Missions should only develop programs and institutions that the national church desired and could support. # The national churches should call out and support their own pastors. # Churches should be built in the native style with money and materials given by the church members. # Intensive biblical and doctrinal instruction should be provided for church leaders every year.

Architecture The building was the first fully Art Deco structure on the street. Interior When the building opened in 1930 it had apartments ranging from three to nine rooms, the largest of which had four bedrooms. The apartments featured a dropped living room, developed by the Earle brothers, which set the interior apart from most others constructed around the same period. An original rental brochure shows the dropped living room nearly entirely open to the entrance gallery; traditionally the gallery was held as a different room. Exterior The exterior of the building is somewhat non-traditional. As the brick facade rises from the ground it changes shade from deep purple to yellow-white. Color was widely used during the 1920s as a tool in architecture for overall effects. The rental brochure stated: \\"new modernistic design of exterior with beautiful shaded color scheme\\". The New Yorkers architecture critic, George S.

They later learn it had been designed and constructed by insane architect and surgeon Ivo Shandor, who founded and led a secret society in 1920, The Cult of Gozer. Consisting of almost one thousand followers, The Cult was dedicated to the worship of Gozer the Gozerian, an ancient, ultra-powerful, apocalyptic entity first worshipped by the Hittites, the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians. The members of The Gozerian Cult were the original occupants of the apartment building, which Shandor had devised as a modern-day ziggurat. According to Stantz ( who - along with Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) - studied Shandor's original blueprints ), \\"The whole building is a huge, superconductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in an concentrating spiritual turbulence.\\" The Cult of Gozer performed bizarre rituals on the roof after its completion (the actual building was built in 1929), seeking to summon Gozer The Destructor and end the world.

The surname is pronounced 'tea-man'. By 1939 he was considered one of the leading non-conformist organists in England. Life Thiman was born in Ashford, Kent, England. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a fellow of the Royal College of Organists (FRCO) in 1921, and a doctor of music (DMus) in 1928. From 1930 he was Professor of Harmony at the Royal Academy of Music and later, from 1956 to 1962, was Dean of the Faculty of Music at the University of London. He toured Australia in August 1951 to conduct examinations for the Australian Musical Examinations Board. From 1958, having moved from Park Chapel (a Congregational church in Crouch End, later to join with Ferme Park Baptist Church to form a Union Church in the same district), he was organist of the City Temple in London, a Congregational church. He was a keen advocate of amateur music-making and in the 1960s was the conductor and Musical Director of the Purley Choral Society, which performed his Spring garland in 1964. The choir, which changed its name to The Chandos Choir in 1969, performed his Go, lovely rose in 2012. He wrote much educational music for piano and other instruments, as well as music for church choirs, some of which is still performed. He is best remembered for his short passion cantata, The last Supper (1930), which sets texts from the gospels of Matthew and John and hymns by St Thomas Aquinas, Charles Wesley and Johann Franck. Thiman's list of published works numbers about 1,300. These include a large number of part songs (many for SS or SSA and piano, but also many for SATB) and many anthems and carols. Most of his church music was written for the non-conformist churches, but he also wrote anthems and canticles for Church of England choirs. It was considered he was strongly influenced by Edward Elgar (1857‚Äì1934). He composed some lighter songs under the name Eric Harding (Harding being his middle name), one of which was published when he was only fifteen. He was conductor of the Elysian Concert Society that performed at Hornsey Town Hall, The City Temple and other venues in London. Thiman died in 1975. Works An archive of his music, The Eric Thiman Collection, was set up in 2014 in the choir library of Southwell Minster. Some of Thiman's musical compositions include: * Apple blossom, from poem by Will H. Ogilvie (1869‚Äì1963) * A clean wind blowing, from poem by Will H. Ogilvie (1869‚Äì1963) * Highland scenes. Stated to consist of five short piano numbers of moderate difficulty, commencing with 'By rock-bound coast', a mistful 'Evening on Skye', bright and rhythmic 'Celtic tune', an expressive 'In the heather', finishing with the Scottish melodies of 'At the highland gathering'. * The jolly waggoner* The last supper * Miniature trio * My bonnie lass * The nativity * Songs of England, based on a group of six poems by Thomas Campbell, John Masefield (1878‚Äì1967), Irene Gass, and J.

Upon the deposition of Herod Archelaus in 6 CE, his territories (Judea, Samaria and Idumea) were transformed into a Roman province.H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , page 246: \\"When Archelaus was deposed from the ethnarchy in 6 CE, Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea were converted into a Roman province under the name Iudaea.\\" With the death of Salome I in 10 CE, her domain was also incorporated into the province. However, other parts of the Herodian Tetrarchy continued to function under Herodians. Thus, Philip the Tetrarch ruled Batanea, with Trachonitis, as well as Auranitis until 34 CE (his domain later being incorporated into the Province of Syria), while Herod Antipas ruled Galilee and Perea until 39 CE. The last notable Herodian ruler with some level of independence was Agrippa I, who was even granted the Judea province, though with his death in 44 CE, the provincial status of Judea was restored for good. Later Herodians including Herod of Chalcis, Aristobulus of Chalcis and Agrippa II (the last of the Herodian dynasty) were given rule over the Kingdom of Chalcis, a Roman vassal state. Agrippa II died childless and thus Chalcis was incorporated into the province of Syria. History At the time of his death, Herod ruled over most of the South Western Levant, as a client-state of the Roman Empire. Antipas was not Herod's first choice of heir. That honor fell to Aristobulus and Alexander, Herod's sons by the Hasmonean princess Mariamne. It was only after they were executed (c. 7 BCE), and Herod's oldest son Antipater was convicted of trying to poison his father (5 BCE), that the now elderly Herod fell back on his youngest son Antipas, revising his will to make him heir.Bruce 6-7; Sch√ºrer 320-325. During his fatal illness in 4 BCE, Herod had yet another change of heart about the succession. According to the final version of his will, Antipas' elder brother Archelaus was now to become king of Judea, Idumea and Samaria, while Antipas would rule Galilee and Perea with the lesser title of tetrarch. Philip was to receive Gaulanitis (the Golan Heights), Batanaea (southern Syria), Trachonitis and Auranitis (Hauran).Josephus, Antiquities 17.188-189, War 1.664. Because of Judea's status as a Roman client kingdom, Herod's plans for the succession had to be ratified by Augustus. The three heirs of Herod therefore traveled to Rome to make their claims, Antipas arguing he ought to inherit the whole kingdom and the others maintaining that Herod's final will ought to be honored. Despite qualified support for Antipas from Herodian family members in Rome, who favored direct Roman rule of Judea but considered Antipas preferable to his brother, Augustus largely confirmed the division of territory set out by Herod in his final will. Archelaus had, however, to be content with the title of ethnarch rather than king.Josephus, Antiquities 17.224-249, 299-323. Herod's sister Salome I also received the title of queen of Jamnia, ruling Paralia and some areas in southern Perea. Upon her death in 10 CE, the domain was incorporated into Judea Province. Eventually, after his death the kingdom was divided between three of Herod's sons: *Archelaus, his son by his fourth wife Malthace the Samaritan, received the lion's share of the kingdom; Idumaea, Judea and Samaria, and the title of Ethnarch (\\"ruler of the people\\"; in this case, the Jews, Samaritans, and Idumeans). *Herod Antipas, Archelaus‚Äô brother, became Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. *Philip I, Herod's son by his fifth wife Cleopatra of Jerusalem, became Tetrarch of the northern part of Herod's kingdom. St. Luke the Evangelist lists Philip's territories as Iturea and Trachonitis: Josephus gives his territories variously as Batanea, Gaulanitis, Trachonitis and Paneas ( Antiquities XVII, 8 : 1) and Batanea, Trachonitis, Auranitis, and \\"a certain part of what is called the House of Zenodorus\\" (Ant XVII, 11 : 4). A number of these names refer to the same places, found now in modern-day Syria and Lebanon. In a turbulent period of history, the rule of the tetrarchs was relatively uneventful. The most trouble fell to Archelaus, who was faced with sedition by the Pharisees at the beginning of his reign, and crushed it with great severity. After ruling for 10 years he was removed by the emperor Augustus in 6 CE, following complaints about his cruelty and his offences against the Mosaic law. He was replaced by a Roman prefect, and his territory re-organized as the Roman province of Iudaea. Philip ruled Ituraea and Trachonitis as a tetrarch until his death in 34 CE when his territories became briefly part of the Roman province of Syria, but in 37 CE were given to Herod Agrippa I. Agrippa arranged for Chalcis to be handed over to his brother Herod and ruled himself in Philip's stead. After the banishment of Herod Antipas in 39 CE Herod Agrippa became ruler of Galilee also, and in 41 CE, as a mark of favour by the emperor Claudius, succeeded the Roman prefect Marullus as King of Iudaea. With this acquisition, a Herodian Kingdom of the Jews was nominally re-established until 44 CE though there is no indication that status as a province was suspended. Name The word Tetrarch suggests four rulers (\\"ruler of a quarter\\"); however Josephus, in the context of describing Herod's legacy, only mentions three. He refers to Archelaus, who had \\"one half of that which had been subject to Herod\\", and for Philip and Antipas \\"the other half, divided into two parts\\".Josephus, Antiquities XVII, 11 : 4 On the other hand, Luke the Evangelist refers to Lysanias, tetrarch of Abilene, in his list of rulers at the time of John the Baptist, alongside Pontius Pilate (one of a series of Roman governors who replaced Archelaus), Herod (Antipas), and Philip.Luke 3 : 1 Josephus' reference to one half the kingdom may signify that Archelaus was ruler of two quarters. This would suggest that division into quarters was already established, and that Lysanias' quarter was part of a different tetrarchy in Syria; this is credible, as Herod III, brother of Herod Agrippa I, was king of Chalcis, which was to the north, outside Herod's kingdom. Or it may be that Josephus, in describing the inheritances of Herod's sons, omitted to mention Lysanias, or his predecessor, as they were not Herodians. The reference to \\"one half of the kingdom\\" could then be understood as a geographical, rather than a political observation; Archelaus' share of the kingdom covered about half the territory, and more than half the revenue, owned by Herod. It is the view of W. Smith, referring to Abilene, that Abilene, or part of it, was subject to Herod before his death, and held by Lysanias as a tetrarchate from him. The territory was returned later to the Herodians, the first part by Caligula to Herod Agrippa I, the remainder by Claudius to Herod Agrippa II.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 4.692 See also *Herodian dynasty NotesReferences : : Category:4 BC establishments Category:44 disestablishments Category:Herodian dynasty Category:Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire Category:Judea Category:New Testament regions Category:Political entities in the Land of Israel Category:States and territories established in the 1st century BC Category:States and territories disestablished in the 1st century ","title":"Herodian Tetrarchy"},{"id":"10439211","text":"Santa Paravia en Fiumaccio is a video game in which each player becomes the ruler of a fledgling Italian city-state around the year 1400. The goal of the game is to become king or queen; to do so the player must manage their city- state so that it may grow. The game, by George Blank, first appeared in the December 1978 issue of SoftSide magazine, (Milford, NH), and was published for sale on tape cassette as a computer game by Instant Software (Peterborough, NH) for the Radio Shack TRS-80, the Apple II, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, and the Commodore PET. It has been translated into many languages, such as ANSI C, and has been ported to the Palm Pilot. Gameplay The game consists of yearly turns, beginning in 1400; each turn involves the allocation of grain, counted in steres, and funds, counted in florins, attempting to grow the colony in both population and size. A ruler must ensure that sufficient grain supplies are available to feed his people; by distributing excess grain, a ruler can encourage more citizens to move into his city-state. However, often famine and rats cause grain reserves to diminish. Funds can be spent to purchase more land, military forces, or various types of structures. These structures include revenue producing mills and markets as well as prestigious palaces and cathedrals. (The 'SoftSide' version had a code error that allowed you to keep all your grain, even when you went bankrupt.) The different social classes present in this game are serfs, clergy, merchants and nobility. Based loosely on the text game Hamurabi, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio was an early God game. It combined 'guns and butter' economic tradeoffs with graphic development of a kingdom with buildings being constructed and shown on the screen as well as character development, shown as progressive promotions from baron to king.

It is in many ways similar to the BSD and other Unix-style boot processes, from which it derives. Booting a Linux installation involves multiple stages and software components, including firmware initialization, execution of a boot loader, loading and startup of a Linux kernel image, and execution of various startup scripts and daemons. For each of these stages and components there are different variations and approaches; for example, GRUB, coreboot or Das U-Boot can be used as boot loaders (historical examples are LILO, SYSLINUX or Loadlin), while the startup scripts can be either traditional init-style, or the system configuration can be performed through modern alternatives such as systemd or Upstart.  Overview  Early stages of the Linux startup process depend very much on the computer architecture. IBM PC compatible hardware is one architecture Linux is commonly used on; on these systems, the BIOS plays an important role, which might not have exact analogs on other systems. In the following example, IBM PC compatible hardware is assumed: # The BIOS performs startup tasks specific to the actual hardware platform. Once the hardware is enumerated and the hardware which is necessary for boot is initialized correctly, the BIOS loads and executes the boot code from the configured boot device. # The boot loader often presents the user with a menu of possible boot options and has a default option, which is selected after some time passes. Once the selection is made, the boot loader loads the kernel into memory, supplies it with some parameters and gives it control. # The kernel, if compressed, will decompress itself. It then sets up system functions such as essential hardware and memory paging, and calls \`start_kernel()\` which performs the majority of system setup (interrupts, the rest of memory management, device and driver initialization, etc.). It then starts up, separately, the idle process, scheduler, and the init process, which is executed in user space. # The init either consists of scripts that are executed by the shell (sysv, bsd, runit) or configuration files that are executed by the binary components (systemd, upstart). Init has specific levels (sysv, bsd) or targets (systemd), each of which consists of specific set of services (daemons). These provide various non-operating system services and structures and form the user environment. A typical server environment starts a web server, database services, and networking. # The typical desktop environment begins with a daemon, called the display manager, that starts a graphic environment which consists of a graphical server that provides a basic underlying graphical stack and a login manager that provides the ability to enter credentials and select a session. After the user has entered the correct credentials, the session manager starts a session. A session is a set of programs such as UI elements (panels, desktops, applets, etc.) which, together, can form a complete desktop environment. On shutdown, init is called to close down all user space functionality in a controlled manner. Once all the other processes have terminated, init makes a system call to the kernel instructing it to shut the system down. Boot loader phase The boot loader phase varies by computer architecture. Since the earlier phases are not specific to the operating system, the BIOS-based boot process for x86 and x86-64 architectures is considered to start when the master boot record (MBR) code is executed in real mode and the first-stage boot loader is loaded. In UEFI systems, a payload, such as the Linux kernel, can be executed directly. Thus no boot loader is necessary. Below is a summary of some popular boot loaders: * coreboot is an implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and usually deployed with the system, and field upgrades provided by the vendor if need be. Parts of coreboot becomes the systems BIOS and stays resident in memory after boot. * Das U-Boot is a boot loader for embedded systems and usually does not stay resident after booting the Linux kernel. It is used on systems that does not have a x86-style BIOS but rather employ custom methods to read the boot loader into memory and execute it. * GRUB 2 differs from GRUB 1 by having two (optionally three) stages and being capable of automatic detection of various operating systems and automatic configuration. The first-stage loader (stage1) is loaded and executed either by the BIOS from the Master boot record (MBR) or by another boot loader from the partition boot sector. Its job is to discover and access various file systems that the configuration can be read from later. The optional, intermediate stage loader (stage1.5) is loaded and executed by the first-stage loader in case the second-stage loader is not contiguous or if the file-system or hardware requires special handling in order to access the second-stage loader. The second-stage loader (stage2) is loaded last and displays the GRUB startup menu that allows the user to choose an operating system or examine and edit startup parameters. After a menu entry is chosen and optional parameters are given, GRUB loads the kernel into memory and passes control to it. GRUB 2 is also capable of chain-loading of another boot loader. * SYSLINUX/ISOLINUX is a boot loader that specializes in booting full Linux installations from FAT filesystems. It is often used for boot or rescue floppy discs, live USBs, and other lightweight boot systems. ISOLINUX is generally used by Linux live CDs and bootable install CDs. Historical boot loaders, nowadays not in common use other than for legacy systems * LILO does not understand or parse filesystem layout. Instead, a configuration file (\`/etc/lilo.conf\`) is created in a live system which maps raw offset information (mapper tool) about location of kernel and ram disks (initrd or initramfs). The configuration file, which includes data such as boot partition and kernel pathname for each, as well as customized options if needed, is then written together with bootloader code into MBR bootsector. When this bootsector is read and given control by BIOS, LILO loads the menu code and draws it then uses stored values together with user input to calculate and load the Linux kernel or chain-load any other boot-loader. * GRUB 1 includes logic to read common file systems at run-time in order to access its configuration file. This gives GRUB 1 ability to read its configuration file from the filesystem rather than have it embedded into the MBR, which allows it to change the configuration at run-time and specify disks and partitions in a human-readable format rather than relying on offsets. It also contains a command-line interface, which makes it easier to fix or modify GRUB if it is misconfigured or corrupt. * Loadlin is a boot loader that can replace a running DOS or Windows 9x kernel with the Linux kernel at run time. This can be useful in the case of hardware that needs to be switched on via software and for which such configuration programs are proprietary and only available for DOS. This booting method is less necessary nowadays, as Linux has drivers for a multitude of hardware devices, but it has seen some use in mobile devices. Another use case is when the Linux is located on a storage device which is not available to the BIOS for booting: DOS or Windows can load the appropriate drivers to make up for the BIOS limitation and boot Linux from there. Kernel phase The kernel in Linux handles all operating system processes, such as memory management, task scheduling, I/O, interprocess communication, and overall system control. This is loaded in two stages - in the first stage, the kernel (as a compressed image file) is loaded into memory and decompressed, and a few fundamental functions such as basic memory management are set up. Control is then switched one final time to the main kernel start process. Once the kernel is fully operational - and as part of its startup, upon being loaded and executing - the kernel looks for an init process to run, which (separately) sets up a user space and the processes needed for a user environment and ultimate login. The kernel itself is then allowed to go idle, subject to calls from other processes. For some platforms (like ARM 64-bit), kernel decompression has to be performed by the boot loader instead. Kernel loading stage The kernel is typically loaded as an image file, compressed into either zImage or bzImage formats with zlib. A routine at the head of it does a minimal amount of hardware setup, decompresses the image fully into high memory, and takes note of any RAM disk if configured. It then executes kernel startup via \`./arch/i386/boot/head\` and the \`startup_32 ()\` (for x86 based processors) process. Kernel startup stage The startup function for the kernel (also called the swapper or process 0) establishes memory management (paging tables and memory paging), detects the type of CPU and any additional functionality such as floating point capabilities, and then switches to non-architecture specific Linux kernel functionality via a call to \`start_kernel()\`. start_kernel executes a wide range of initialization functions. It sets up interrupt handling (IRQs), further configures memory, starts the Init process (the first user-space process), and then starts the idle task via \`cpu_idle()\`. Notably, the kernel startup process also mounts the initial RAM disk (\\"initrd\\") that was loaded previously as the temporary root file system during the boot phase. The initrd allows driver modules to be loaded directly from memory, without reliance upon other devices (e.g. a hard disk) and the drivers that are needed to access them (e.g. a SATA driver). This split of some drivers statically compiled into the kernel and other drivers loaded from initrd allows for a smaller kernel. The root file system is later switched via a call to \`pivot_root()\` which unmounts the temporary root file system and replaces it with the use of the real one, once the latter is accessible. The memory used by the temporary root file system is then reclaimed. Thus, the kernel initializes devices, mounts the root filesystem specified by the boot loader as read only, and runs Init (\`/sbin/init\`) which is designated as the first process run by the system (PID = 1).http://oldfield.wattle.id.au/luv/boot.html Linux Boot Process - by Kim Oldfield (2001) A message is printed by the kernel upon mounting the file system, and by Init upon starting the Init process. It may also optionally run Initrd to allow setup and device related matters (RAM disk or similar) to be handled before the root file system is mounted. According to Red Hat, the detailed kernel process at this stage is therefore summarized as follows: :\\"When the kernel is loaded, it immediately initializes and configures the computer's memory and configures the various hardware attached to the system, including all processors, I/O subsystems, and storage devices. It then looks for the compressed initrd image in a predetermined location in memory, decompresses it, mounts it, and loads all necessary drivers. Next, it initializes virtual devices related to the file system, such as LVM or software RAID before unmounting the initrd disk image and freeing up all the memory the disk image once occupied. The kernel then creates a root device, mounts the root partition read-only, and frees any unused memory. At this point, the kernel is loaded into memory and operational. However, since there are no user applications that allow meaningful input to the system, not much can be done with it.\\" An initramfs-style boot is similar, but not identical to the described initrd boot. At this point, with interrupts enabled, the scheduler can take control of the overall management of the system, to provide pre-emptive multi-tasking, and the init process is left to continue booting the user environment in user space.  Early user space  initramfs, also known as early user space, has been available since version 2.5.46 of the Linux kernel, with the intent to replace as many functions as possible that previously the kernel would have performed during the start-up process. Typical uses of early user space are to detect what device drivers are needed to load the main user space file system and load them from a temporary filesystem. Many distributions use dracut to generate and maintain the initramfs image.  Init process  Once the kernel has started, it starts the init process. Historically this was the \\"SysV init\\", which was just called \\"init\\". More recent Linux distributions are likely to use one of the more modern alternatives such as \\"systemd\\". Basically, these are grouped as operating system service-management.  SysV init  Init's job is \\"to get everything running the way it should be\\" once the kernel is fully running. Essentially it establishes and operates the entire user space. This includes checking and mounting file systems, starting up necessary user services, and ultimately switching to a user-environment when system startup is completed. It is similar to the Unix and BSD init processes, from which it derived, but in some cases has diverged or became customized. In a standard Linux system, Init is executed with a parameter, known as a runlevel, that takes a value from 0 to 6, and that determines which subsystems are to be made operational. Each runlevel has its own scripts which codify the various processes involved in setting up or leaving the given runlevel, and it is these scripts which are referenced as necessary in the boot process. Init scripts are typically held in directories with names such as \`\\"/etc/rc...\\"\`. The top level configuration file for init is at \`/etc/inittab\`. During system boot, it checks whether a default runlevel is specified in /etc/inittab, and requests the runlevel to enter via the system console if not. It then proceeds to run all the relevant boot scripts for the given runlevel, including loading modules, checking the integrity of the root file system (which was mounted read-only) and then remounting it for full read-write access, and sets up the network. After it has spawned all of the processes specified, init goes dormant, and waits for one of three events to happen: processes that started to end or die, a power failure signal, or a request via \`/sbin/telinit\` to further change the runlevel. This applies to SysV-style init.  systemd  The developers of systemd aimed to replace the Linux init system inherited from UNIX System V and Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating systems. Like init, systemd is a daemon that manages other daemons. All daemons, including systemd, are background processes. Systemd is the first daemon to start (during booting) and the last daemon to terminate (during shutdown). Lennart Poettering and Kay Sievers, software engineers that initially developed systemd, sought to surpass the efficiency of the init daemon in several ways. They wanted to improve the software framework for expressing dependencies, to allow more processing to be done in parallel during system booting, and to reduce the computational overhead of the shell. Systemd's initialization instructions for each daemon are recorded in a declarative configuration file rather than a shell script. For inter-process communication, systemd makes Unix domain sockets and D-Bus available to the running daemons. Systemd is also capable of aggressive parallelization.  Upstart  The traditional init process was originally only responsible for bringing the computer into a normal running state after power-on, or gracefully shutting down services prior to shutdown. As a result, the design is strictly synchronous, blocking future tasks until the current one has completed. Its tasks must also be defined in advance, as they are limited to this prep or cleanup function. This leaves it unable to handle various non-startup-tasks on a modern desktop computer. Upstart operates asynchronously; it handles starting of the tasks and services during boot and stopping them during shutdown, and also supervises the tasks and services while the system is running. Easy transition and perfect backward compatibility with sysvinit were the explicit design goals; accordingly, Upstart can run unmodified sysvinit scripts. In this way it differs from most other init replacements (beside systemd and OpenRC), which usually assume and require complete transition to run properly, and do not support a mixed environment of traditional and new startup methods. Upstart allows for extensions to its event model through the use of initctl to input custom, single events, or event bridges to integrate many or more-complicated events. By default, Upstart includes bridges for socket, dbus, udev, file, and dconf events; additionally, more bridges (for example, a Mach ports bridge, or a devd (found on FreeBSD systems) bridge) are possible.  runit  Runit is an init scheme for Unix-like operating systems that initializes, supervises, and ends processes throughout the operating system. It is a reimplementation of the daemontools process supervision toolkit that runs on the Linux, Mac OS X, *BSD, and Solaris operating systems. Runit features parallelization of the start up of system services, which can speed up the boot time of the operating system. Runit is an init daemon, so it is the direct or indirect ancestor of all other processes. It is the first process started during booting, and continues running until the system is shut down.

The station carries EMF's K-LOVE contemporary Christian music format. The transmitter is located in Hearne, Texas. History The station first existed as KCRM from June 1, 1982 to December 27, 1993, before changing its call sign to KHLR. On April 9, 2001, the station's call sign became KXCS, which it kept until receiving the call sign of KJXJ on March 29, 2007. KXCS KXCS used the slogans \\"103.9 XCS, Everything That Rocks\\" and \\"Aggieland's New Rock Alternative, 103.9 The X\\", and once carried the Lex and Terry and Loveline programs. Transition to KJXJ On the evening of March 19, 2007, DJs announced that the station was changing from the Rock/Alternative Rock format. The last DJs that night were Kira McKinney (on-air moniker: \\"The Queen of Rock\\") to 10 PM, and Dex Peck from 10 PM-midnight. The last songs under the old format: \\"I Ran (So Far Away)\\" by A Flock of Seagulls; \\"Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)\\" by Cobra Starship; \\"Joker and the Thief\\" by Wolfmother; \\"Teenage Dirtbag\\" by Wheatus; and \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" by Queen, dedicated by Dex to a list of staffers. The transition day of March 20 was a confusing and motley collection of music not conforming to a single genre. Across the course of the day, listeners heard a bizarre mixture of rap, classic rock, show tunes, TV theme songs, reggae, easy listening, and others. Shortly after midnight, the audio feed abruptly cut off in the middle of a long string of Irish Drinking Songs, and suddenly new programming came over the air, identifying the broadcast as a Jack FM station.

He wrote a series of books that helped popularize and develop understanding of recreational cross-country skiing in the United States. Consequently, Caldwell has been called the \\"father\\" and \\"guru\\" of Nordic skiing in North America. Personal life Born in Detroit, Michigan, Caldwell grew up in Somerset, Pennsylvania and moved to Putney, Vermont with his parents in 1941. He graduated from Dartmouth College In 1950. Caldwell and his wife, Hep (n√©e Hester Goodenough), had four children, Tim, Sverre, Peter, and Jennifer. He resides in Putney, Vermont. Career Caldwell served variously as a U.S. Ski Team coach, Putney School math teacher and coach, author on cross-country skiing topics, and founder of the New England Nordic Ski Association (NENSA). Caldwell is credited with helping start up the U.S. women's cross-country skiing program. According to his reminiscences, Caldwell's early skiing career began while he was at Dartmouth College when he had an opportunity to participate in the World Nordic Championships in Nordic Combined skiing (both cross-country and ski- jumping). He entered the U.S. Navy through Dartmouth ROTC and was detailed to continue his skiing career. Having placed well in Olympic tryouts, he qualified for the 1952 Olympic Nordic Combined Team. Caldwell competed in the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, finishing 22nd in the nordic combined event and 73rd in the 18 km cross-country skiing event. Caldwell coached the U.S. cross- country team at the Winter Olympics in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, and 1984. He also coached at the Putney School from the mid-1950s until his 1989 retirement. Among the Putney students that he coached, who skied for the U.S. Cross-Country Ski Team, were Bob Gray (1968 and 1972 Winter Olympics), Martha Rockwell (1972 and 1976 Winter Olympics), Mike Gallagher (1964, 1968 and 1972 Winter Olympics), his own children, and Bill Koch, the only American to ever medal in cross country skiing‚Äîboth at the Winter Olympics (30 km silver: 1976 Innsbruck) and at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (30 km bronze: 1982 Oslo). Legacy Caldwell's book, The Cross-Country Ski Book, was published in eight editions from 1964 to 1987 and with a half-million copies became one of the most widely distributed skiing books, published in the United States. He was inducted into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame in 1983 and into the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame in April 2017, along with one-time mentee Martha Rockwell. Caldwell's progeny continued the tradition of cross-country skiing. His eldest son, Tim Caldwell, competed in four Winter Olympics from (1972 through 1984). His daughter, Jennifer Caldwell, was the women's champion of the 1983 American Birkebeiner. His son, Sverre Caldwell, is a noted cross- country ski coach whose daughter, Sophie Caldwell, finished sixth in the sprint freestyle event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, the highest finish by a U.S. woman in Olympic cross-country skiing at that time.

There may have been a church on the site since the 7th century. Construction of the present building took place during the 13th century. Restoration work was later carried out in the 19th century by the Gothic Revival architects Thomas Rickman and George Edmund Street. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building.  History  The first church on the site probably dates to around AD 691‚Äì92, when King √Üthelred of Mercia made a grant of land to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester. Around 1093 a charter of another Bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, endowed the Henbury church and all of its tithes to Westbury on Trym's monastery, which Wulfstan had acquired for the Worcester diocese around that time. When the monastery became Westbury College around 1194, the area around Henbury became a prebend of the college. The tithes from Henbury provided a revenue for one of the college's canons, who was responsible for providing the vicar for St Mary's. In addition, the Henbury church was the other church, alongside Holy Trinity Church, Westbury on Trym, whose maintenance was a collective responsibility of the college community. The college periodically received supervisory visits from the Worcester diocese, with a bishop's palace in Henbury used as an episcopal residence until the late 15th century. This was situated somewhere close to St Mary's, though its exact location is not certain. When Westbury College was dissolved in 1544, St Mary's became a parish church of the new Bristol diocese. Archives Parish records for St Mary's church, Henbury, Bristol are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P.Hen) (online catalogue) including baptism, marriage and burial registers. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, churchwardens, overseers of the poor, parochial church council, charities, schools and societies plus deeds, plans and photographs.  Architecture  The nave and lower tower date from around 1200. In the early 13th century the upper tower, chancel and south chapel were added, and the clerestory was built around 1300. These features are in the Early English style, although with some restoration since. Most notable are the Late Norman doorways, which have segmental arches. In 1836 Thomas Rickman built the north chapel and carried out restoration work, and the church was further restored by George Edmund Street in 1875‚Äì77. The 19th century restorations introduced Perpendicular Gothic Revival style features, in particular the windows for the nave and the chapels. In the churchyard there is a mortuary chapel which was built around 1830, and may also have been designed by Rickman. It is in the Early English Gothic Revival style and has been designated by English Heritage as grade II listed.  Memorials  Grave of Scipio Africanus The slave known as Scipio Africanus is buried in the churchyard in a grave with elaborately painted headstone and footstone, dated 1720. It is grade II* listed. An obelisk with a stone ankh marks the grave of the Egyptologist Amelia Edwards. She is buried alongside her companion, Ellen Drew Braysher, with whom she had lived in Westbury on Trym, and Braysher's daughter, Sarah Harriet. In September 2016, Historic England designated the grave as grade II listed, celebrating it as a landmark in English LGBT history. The churchyard also contains the grave of Philip Napier Miles, the philanthropic last \\"squire\\" of King's Weston, who died in 1935. There are war graves in both the church's churchyard extension and its detached church cemetery.

Effects Orally administered sodium picosulfate is generally used for thorough evacuation of the bowel, usually for patients who are preparing to undergo a colonoscopy. It takes 12‚Äì24 hours to work, since it works in the colon. Abdominal cramps and diarrhea are normal effects of picosulfate and should be expected. The use of sodium picosulfate has also been associated with certain electrolyte disturbances, such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Free full text from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration Patients are often required to drink large amounts of clear fluids, to compensate for dehydration and to reestablish normal electrolyte balance.  Mechanism of action  Sodium picosulfate is a prodrug. It has no significant direct physiological effect on the intestine; however, it is metabolised by gut bacteria into the active compound 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl-(2-pyridiyl)methane (DPM, BPHM). This compound is a stimulant laxative and increases peristalsis in the gut. Sodium picosulfate is typically prescribed in a combined formulation with magnesium citrate, an osmotic laxative.

Cognio‚Äôs Spectrum Expert product was designed for common frequency bands such as RFID and Wi-Fi. It was sold primarily to network engineers responsible for security for wireless networks or applications that run on wireless networks. Cognio was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2007. History Cognio was founded in 2000 and was originally called Aryya Communications. It first announced a \\"cognitive link processing\\" technology, and was located in Waltham, Massachusetts near Boston. In February, 2001, Gary Ambrosino became Interim CEO to work with the founding team in commercializing the product and raising additional capital. In March 2003 it announced $12.5 million of venture capital funding from North Bridge Venture Partners and ABS Ventures as round B. In January 2005, Thomas McPherson became chief executive officer. Cognio was headquartered in Germantown, Maryland (near Washington, DC), United States, and had an additional investments that included Avansis Ventures as a fourth round in April 2007, for a total of $30 million. Products In June 2003, Cognio announced \\"intelligent spectrum management\\" technology, sometimes called cognitive radio. Cognio shipped its Wi-Fi management software in the spring of 2005. Cognio was granted 12 patents, and submitted 172 patent applications for its RF analysis technology. IEEE 802.11 wireless network protocols (the standards which are marketed under the \\"Wi-Fi\\" brand) operate in an unlicensed spectrum. That is, their frequency bands are not licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or other organizations exclusively for 802.11 traffic. Instead, the spectrum is shared with many other types of devices, such as cordless phones and Bluetooth devices. Because of its shared spectrum, an 802.11 device will shut itself out of communications if the airwaves are crowded with other radio signals. Other spectrum management tools do not measure or analyze RF interference problems. They monitor only Layers 2 and up in the OSI model, and report that performance is slow, but are typically unable to report that slow performance is caused by interference. Network engineers could make use of scientific spectrum analyzers. But these tools, which were designed for use in laboratory settings, are often too large and heavy for use by network administrators moving throughout a building during the course of a day. Many spectrum analyzers cost tens of thousands of dollars. Cognio sold Spectrum Expert for WiFi and Spectrum Expert for RFID. (In its product naming, Cognio omits the hyphen that officially appears in the trademark Wi-Fi.) The product consisted of a PC CardBus card that included a built-in antenna and hardware designed to rapidly analyze RF activity. Spectrum Expert for WiFi scans the radio spectrum used for IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g networks (2.4 to 2.5 GHz). It can also scan the spectrum used for IEEE 802.11a networks (4.9 GHz to 5.9 GHz). Cognio Spectrum Expert for RFID is similar, except that it scans the radio spectrum used for RFID tags (851-870 MHz and 902-960 MHz). Spectrum Expert‚Äôs bar graphs show how much Wi-Fi channel interference a specific device is causing on a specific channel. Once they identify an interfering device, network engineers can use Spectrum Expert‚Äôs Device Locator feature, which works like a sort of RF Geiger counter, to track the signal strength and location of the device, so it can be removed, repositioned, or shielded. Cognio sold directly, but primarily through resellers, and through partnerships. These included WildPackets, AirMagnet, and Fluke Networks. Cisco On October 3, 2006, Cognio and Cisco Systems announced a partnership. On February 26, 2007, Cisco added a web page devoted to RF interference which featured Cognio Spectrum Expert. In September 2007 Cisco agreed to acquire Cognio. It then rebranded the product as \\"Cisco Spectrum Expert\\". Cisco announced an integrated circuit called CleanAir in 2010 using some Cognio technology.

Leach (born March 9, 1960) is a former collegiate and ATP Tour professional tennis player who won the NCAA singles championship in 1982 while attending the University of Michigan. Early years Leach grew up in Weston, Massachusetts outside Boston. He was the third child in a family of six and began playing tennis after he received a racket for his 11th birthday. He earned the No. 1 singles and doubles rankings in New England's 14-and-under division, and upon moving to the 16-18 division, he was ranked No. 11 nationally. University of Michigan Leach accepted a tennis scholarship to attend the University of Michigan, where he won the 1982 NCAA singles title was the first married NCAA winner in history, and was a two-time All-American. He played for Michigan's tennis team from 1979 to 1982. As a sophomore, he was Michigan's top player with a 24-4 singles record, leading to the Big Ten singles and doubles titles. As a junior, Leach won all but two individual matches and made the final 16 in the NCAA Tournament. His performance earned him All-America honors in 1981. In 1982, as an unseeded player, he was a long shot to win the NCAA singles title against future 12-year professional Brad Gilbert of Pepperdine. Leach pressured the usually consistent Gilbert into errors and thrilled the collegiate tennis world by winning the 1982 NCAA singles title in straight sets (7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì3). He became only the second Wolverine to win the national title, joining Barry MacKay who won the singles title in 1957. He was also a two-time Big Ten Conference doubles champion with Matt Horwitch in 1980 and with Mark Mees in 1982.

It has been designated as a grade II* listed building, and is currently described as being in poor condition and on the Buildings at Risk Register. The tower dates from the mid 15th century, however the rest of the church was rebuilt between 1775 and 1777 by Thomas Paty. It has been closed since the 1990s, however plans have been drawn up for the future use of the building and the restoration work required. History The original church on the site was Norman. As it was outside the original city walls it was known as St Michael on the Mount Without. The tower was added in the 15th century. Bells were installed in the tower in 1739. By the 1760s the population of the city and parish had grown requiring expansion of church. A survey by Thomas Paty described the fabric of the old building as \\"ruinous\\" and, as a result demolition of everything except the tower was undertaken and it was rebuilt. It has an aisled nave, chancel and north and south porches, along with the older tower in the west. It was damaged in 1941 during the Bristol Blitz and the fire caused by incendiary bombs left it without a roof but it was considered repairable. The church closed in 1999 due to falling attendances and has been boarded up since then. Some walls are covered in ivy and are in shadow from overgrown trees. Various plans have been put forward for the church's future use. The Bristol Civic Society is working with the Diocese of Bristol and others to develop a sustainable use for the future. A bid for Heritage Lottery Fund support has been submitted for the first stage of the work. There was a tradition at the church of distributing large buns known as Colston buns or Tuppenny Starvers to local children on Easter Tuesday. Since the closure of the church this has been continued at the local primary school. In October 2016 the building caught fire, with reports of the roof collapsing. Fifteen fire engines from Avon Fire and Rescue Service attended. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said that the fire was started deliberately. In October 2017 the building was put up for sale and was bought in 2019 by local businessman, Norman Routledge, to restore as a performing arts venue Archives Parish records for the church of St Michael on the Mount Without, Bristol are held at Bristol Archives (Ref.

It was a well known, well recognised and easily located 'marker' on the Scottish Marches and where a number of functions were performed prior to the Union of the Crowns, such arranging truces, exchanging prisoners, etc.Maxwell, Page 132 Etymology A 'tryst' is a time and a place for a meeting, especially of lovers. In Old French the word meant an appointed station in hunting. It is likely from an Old Norse source sharing its origin with 'traust', and the Modern English 'trust' (and thus also related to the Old English 'treowe' which survives as the modern 'true').Online Etymology Dictionary A trysting day is an arranged day of meeting or assembling, as of soldiers, friends, lovers and the like.  History  Many trees have through their isolation, appearance or position been chosen as popular meeting places for young courting couples, soldiers called to gather at a distinctive venue prior to battle, etc. Many a romantic story features trysting trees, including the tales of Robin Hood and his merry men. In the 1845 version of the story, Maid Marion and Robin Hood are buried together under their 'Trysting Tree.'Egan.

The tree has long been a feature of Bemersyde, appearing in many paintings of the house including a sketch by Turner, located in the British Museum, London. The tree is thought to have been planted in the 12th century by Petrus de Haga, making it 800 years old.Rodger, Page 57 The Covin Trysting Sweet Chestnut tree at Bemersyde. Although the original trunk has now died, layers were taken by Earl Haig in the 1950s resulting in several new healthy stems rising from the base. One of the layers, planted about 30 meters from the original, is growing into a fine looking individual. The old rings that can be seen in the branches of the original Covin Tree were once attached to concrete weights which aimed to balance the trunk ‚Äì in its younger days the tree was twice as high as it is now. The 'Kissing Beech' is located at Kilravock Castle, Inverness-shire.

The \\"venerable oak\\" was stated as \\"great trysting tree in the Hart-hill Walk\\" which was, in earlier times, a private road owned and maintained by the Dukes of Leeds, and now forms that part of Kiveton Lane between the Rectory glebe land and Kiveton. On the sandy heath of Barnhamcross Common in East Anglie used to be a pine tree about which curious customs have gathered. Called variously the Trysting Pine, Kissing Tree or Wishing Tree, the trunk had twisted and curled itself into a loop not far from the ground. One tradition said that a person had to pull off or knock down a single fir cone, hold it in the right hand, place one's head through the loop and make a wish. Another version told that couples must hold hands through the loop, then kiss and pledge undying love, hoping the tree would bind them to it with its magic. America A Pedunculate oak. In America the San Juan Capistrano 'Trysting Tree', a sycamore, is connected with the story of one notorious Tiburcio V√°squez, who used San Juan Capistrano and this tree for his gang's own purposes. The gang used the tree as a base to meet and divide up the spoils after a raid, secure food, and then head for the hills to hide out. Vasquez was quite active in this area. His gang raided pueblos, stole cattle, and even held up the Seely and Wright stage coach that travelled between Santa Ana and San Diego. The Trysting Tree at Oregon State University, in the USA, was a large Gray Poplar (Populus √ó canescens) located southeast of Benton Hall, and was a popular gathering spot on campus. According to one story, George Coote, a faculty member in Horticulture, planted the tree between 1880 and 1885. An early alumnus claimed that the Trysting Tree was so named because of its \\"magical effects on students, especially in springtime\\". The tree's popularity was such that the Board of Regents felt obliged to place two arc lights on the cupola of Benton Hall (then the administration building) \\"to keep the tree from being overworked\\". On September 27, 1987, the original Trysting Tree was cut down because of advanced disease in its trunk and limbs. Prior to its removal, Jack Stang (Department of Horticulture) took several cuttings from the tree and rooted them.

He is the younger brother of Peter Reid and played in a similarly hardworking and tough- tackling manner for Rochdale (in two spells), Preston North End, York City, Bury, Chester City (where he also held coaching roles) and Leigh RMI from 1983 to 2000. He has formerly been in charge at Prescot Cables and Warrington Town Brotherly Encounters On-field meetings between Peter and Shaun were confined to pre-season matches, although when Peter was manager of Sunderland they met Shaun's Chester team in the League Cup second round over two legs in September 1998. Shaun had been out through injury for 14 months but returned just in time for the games, which ended in an unsurprising 4‚Äì0 aggregate success for Sunderland. Basement Boy Unusually, all of Shaun's 432 Football League appearances were made in the fourth tier (Division Four, later renamed Division Three and now known as League Two). He did not make any more appearances for Bury after they were promoted from Division Three in 1995‚Äì96. His debut had been a 1‚Äì0 win for Rochdale at Crewe Alexandra in January 1984. Reid's final Football League appearance was as a late substitute for Chester in a 5‚Äì0 win over Mansfield Town on 25 March 2000, just six weeks before Chester themselves fell out of the league. He was strongly rumoured to be returning to Rochdale as manager when Graham Barrow was sacked but the job went to Steve Parkin instead. His only subsequent outing at a notable level was again as a substitute for Leigh RMI in a 2‚Äì0 Football Conference win over Scarborough in August 2000. He went on to become a football agent. Coaching and managerial career Reid holds a UEFA B coaching badge and has had spells coaching at Swindon Town and Plymouth Argyle. In January 2012 he was appointed as manager at Prescot Cables before leaving in March 2012 to become manager at Warrington Town. In the 2014‚Äì15 FA Cup, Reid took Warrington to the first round proper for the first time in their history, where they defeated Exeter City of League Two 1‚Äì0., In March 2016 Reid had his contract mutually terminated.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables below differentiate between towns and cities. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties. Some southern and coastal counties, including Kennebec County, also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory, however. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be ‚Äúorganized‚Äù, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Kennebec County does not currently contain any plantations, but it has included at least one plantation in the past. The unincorporated territory that currently exists within the county is unorganized. Separate sections with census totals for unincorporated areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total. The unincorporated territory in Kennebec County consists of a tract of land (\\"Unity Township\\") which was originally a gore, later became an organized plantation, and is now unorganized territory. Except for Unity Township, all of Kennebec County is incorporated. (During the period when Unity Township was a plantation, Kennebec County was entirely organized, but it has never been entirely incorporated.)

It was adjacent to, but a distinct entity from, the incorporated town of Unity, across the line in Waldo County (because plantations are organized at the county level, they are allowed to duplicate the names of incorporated towns). Unity Plantation was the only territory in the county that was not part of an incorporated town or city. Unity surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory in 1942. There have not been any plantations in Kennebec County since that time. Unity Plantation's population in the 1900 through 1940 censuses was as follows: 1900: 50 1910: 56 1920: 46 1930: 34 1940: 52 Unorganized Territory In 1900, Kennebec County was entirely organized. It lost this status in 1942 when Unity Plantation surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory. The former Unity Plantation, a tract which was originally a gore, has remained the only unorganized territory in the county. At all times since 1942, this has been the only territory in the county that is not part of an incorporated town or city. It is sometimes referred to as \\"Unity Township\\". Its population in each census since 1950 is as follows: 1950: 44 1960: 53 1970: 45 1980: 37 1990: 36 2000: 31 Notes 1960 census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1960 census totals subsequent to their initial release. When it did so, however, it appears to have updated municipal totals only, not overall county totals or state totals, even though in most cases changing municipal totals should have caused county and state totals to change. The 1960 total for Kennebec County was originally reported as 89,150; and for the city of Waterville, 18,695. The total for Waterville was later revised to that shown in the list above (19,001). This should have caused the county total to change as well (to 89,456), but subsequent census publications have continued to list the county total as it was originally reported (89,150). As a result, in the list above, the municipal totals for 1960 do not add to the county total. The 1960 state total for Maine that appears in various Census materials (969,265) likewise reflects the original 1960 total for Kennebec County, and does not take into account the revision made to the population of Waterville. 1970 census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1970 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 1970 total for Kennebec County was originally reported as 95,247, and for the town of Chelsea, 2,095. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above.

Plot In a forest on a remote island, a team of loggers led by Mac (Julian Christopher) face opposition from protesters led by Rita, a known eco- terrorist. The company that employs Mac's team is conducting an experiment in the area, supervised by Carter, a chemist. One of Mac's loggers hits a spiked tree and suffers a wound from his chainsaw. The sap of the tree infects his wounds and causes him to undergo a transformation. The president of the company decides to send his son Tyler to investigate the loss of contact with the loggers, hoping Tyler will learn more about the industry. When he arrives, Tyler discovers most of the loggers and protesters have become zombies. He comes across a bunker where Mac, Rita and Carter have taken shelter, along with other survivors including Mac's apprentice Luke (Michael Teigen). The company learns of the zombie outbreak when a chemist examining one of Carter's samples at their lab is infected by the altered sap. Tyler's father wishes to send an evacuation to rescue his son but is overruled by the other members of the board, who decide to set up a quarantine. The survivors leave the bunker and attempt to drive off the island, but they find the road blocked by the company. They get separated and several more victims fall to the zombies. After reuniting at the logging base, Mac recovers another truck and the group decides to travel to another abandoned facility in the hopes of radioing for help. At the camp, Mac finds the radio dead, while Tyler and Rita begin to become close. Luke is dragged off by the zombies when Carter becomes too frightened to help him. Later, Carter becomes overwhelmed by guilt and confesses that the company had him conducting genetic experiments to grow the trees faster, leading to an increase in profit. The next day, the remaining survivors attempt to drive to another potential exit but encounter more zombies. Mac loses hope when he sees Luke as a zombie, as he considered Luke a son. He tearfully kills Luke with an axe, after which Rita tries to console him. They find the road blocked but hear a chopper approaching. Instead of saving them, however, the chopper opens fire. They are rescued by another renegade band of surviving loggers, who reveal that the company plans to kill them all. The militaristic nature of the camp disturbs the remaining survivors, especially a sadistic game they play in which a selected member of the camp must kill a certain number of zombies in a pen. That night, the head of the camp attempts to rape Rita, but Tyler defends her. They admit their attraction and have sex. The next day, Carter is selected to enter the pen, but he becomes frightened and jams his gun, ending up needing to be rescued. He is bullied mercilessly for this by the loggers, who blame him for the crisis. His spirit broken, Carter takes an axe and leaves the camp alone that night. Zombies wander in through the open gate and kill everyone except Mac, Rita and Tyler, who wake up and flee. At the gate, Mac is bitten. Rita confesses to him as he turns that she was the one who spiked the tree, and with his last breaths as a human, Mac forgives her. While running through the woods, Tyler and Rita hear Carter, who is surrounded by zombies, screaming for help. Tyler attempts to save him, but they are both overrun by zombies. Rita, now the last survivor, sees the lights of a car and happens upon a road she begins to follow in hopes of escape. In his mansion, Tyler's father looks sadly at a picture of himself with Tyler, realizing that his actions led to the loss of his son.

Produced by Phil Spector, their version was issued as a single credited to the Crystals, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in November 1962. It was Spector's first number one hit since \\"To Know Him Is to Love Him\\" (1958). In 2004, \\"He's a Rebel\\" was ranked No. 263 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Billboard named the song #31 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. History The song is about a girl in love with a young man who spurns society's conventions. Despite his being misunderstood by others, the singer claims he is sweet and faithful and vows to be the same towards him. Steve Douglas performs a saxophone solo during the song's bridge. The piano riff at the beginning was contributed by Al DeLory. Unusual for Spector productions, no strings played on the track. Pitney wrote \\"He's a Rebel\\" for The Shirelles, but they declined. Spector learned Vikki Carr was to record it for Liberty Records as her debut, and wanted his own version on sale first. The Crystals were touring on the east coast of the USA at the time, so Spector had The Blossoms, a Los Angeles group, record the track. He credited The Crystals on the record; Mary Thomas recalled that \\"our mouths fell open\\" when she and her groupmates heard a disc jockey announce \\"the new Crystals song.\\" The quintet was then obliged to add \\"He's a Rebel\\" to their live repertoire, even though lead singer Barbara Alston could not mimic Blossoms lead singer Darlene Love. For this reason, 15-year-old Dolores \\"LaLa\\" Brooks became the lead singer the following year with the follow-up \\"Then He Kissed Me\\". \\"He's a Rebel\\" was released in late August 1962, with the b-side \\"I Love You Eddie.\\" By November 3, \\"He's a Rebel\\" had reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.Billboard Music Week Hot 100\\", Billboard.

Lysins are highly evolved enzymes that are able to target one of the five bonds in peptidoglycan (murein), the main component of bacterial cell walls, which allows the release of progeny virions from the lysed cell. Cell-wall-containing Archaea are also lysed by specialized pseudomurein-cleaving lysins, while most archaeal viruses employ alternative mechanisms. Similarly, not all bacteriophages synthesize lysins: some small single-stranded DNA and RNA phages produce membrane proteins that activate the host's autolytic mechanisms such as autolysins. Lysins are being used as antibacterial agents due to their high effectiveness and specificity in comparison with antibiotics, which are susceptible to bacterial resistance.  Structure  Double-stranded DNA phage lysins tend to lie within the 25 to 40 kDa range in terms of size. A notable exception is the streptococcal PlyC endolysin, which is 114 kDa. PlyC is not only the biggest and most potent lysin, but also structurally unique since it is composed of two different gene products, PlyCA and PlyCB, with a ratio of eight PlyCB subunits for each PlyCA in its active conformation. All other lysins are monomeric and comprise two domains separated by a short linker region. For gram positive bacteria lysins, the N-terminal domain catalyses the hydrolysis of peptidoglycan whereas the C-terminal domain binds to the cell wall substrate.  Catalytic domain  The catalytic domain is responsible for the cleavage of peptidoglycan bonds. Functionally, five types of lysin catalytic domain can be distinguished: * Endo-Œ≤-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Endoglycosidase H, ) * N-acetylmuramidase (lysozyme-like, ) * Endopeptidase * N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (T7-like, ) * Œ≥-D-glutaminyl-L-lysine endopeptidase () Peptidoglycan consists of cross-linked amino acids and sugars which form alternating amino sugars: N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM). Endo-Œ≤-N- acetylglucosaminidase lysins cleave NAGs while N-acetylmuramidase lysins (lysozyme-like lysins) cleave NAMs. Endopeptidase lysins cleave any of the peptide bonds between amino acids, whereas N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase lysins (or simply amidase lysins) hydrolyze the amide bond between the sugar and the amino acid moieties. Finally, the recently discovered Œ≥-d-glutaminyl- l-lysine endopeptidase lysins cleave the gamma bond between D-glutamine and L-lysine residues. As is the case for autolysins, early confusion around the cleavage specificity of these individual enzymes has led to some misattributions of the name \\"lysozyme\\" to proteins without this activity. Usually, two or more different catalytic domains are linked to a single cell- binding domain. This is typical in many staphylococcal lysins as well as the streptococcal PlyC holoenzyme, which contains two catalytic domains. Catalytic domains are highly conserved in phage lysins of the same class.  Cell- binding domain  The cell-binding domain (CBD) binds to a specific substrate found in the host bacterium's cell wall, usually a carbohydrate. In contrast to the catalytic domain, the cell-binding domain is variable, which allows a great specificity and decreases bacterial resistance. Binding affinity to the cell wall substrate tends to be high, possibly so as to sequester onto cell wall fragments any free enzyme, which could compete with phage progeny from infecting adjacent host bacteria.  Evolution  It has been proposed that the main mechanism of evolution in phage lysins is the exchange of modular units, a process by which different catalytic and cell-binding domains have been swapped between lysins, which would have resulted in new combinations of both bacterial binding and catalytic specificities.  Mode of action  The lysin catalytic domain digests peptidoglycan locally at a high rate, which causes holes in the cell wall. Since the cross-linked peptidoglycan cell wall is the only mechanism that prevents the spontaneous burst of bacterial cells due to the high internal pressure (3 to 5 atmospheres), enzymatic digestion by lysins irreversibly causes hypotonic lysis. Theoretically, due to the catalytic properties of phage lysins, a single enzyme would be sufficient to kill the host bacterium by cleaving the necessary number of bonds, even though this has yet to be proven. The work by Loessner et al suggests that cleavage is typically achieved by the joint action of multiple lysin molecules at a local region of the host's cell wall. The high binding affinity to the cell wall substrate (close to that of IgG for its substrate) of each lysin appear to be reason why multiple molecules are required, since every lysin binds so tightly to the cell wall that it can't break enough bonds to cause lysis by itself. In order to reach the cell wall, phage lysins have to cross the cell membrane. However, they generally lack a signal peptide that would allow them to do so. In order to solve such a problem, phage viruses synthesize another protein called holin which binds to the cell membrane and makes holes in it (hence its name), allowing lysins to reach the peptidoglycan matrix. The prototypical holin is the lambda phage S protein, which assists the lambda phage R protein (lysin). All holins embed themselves in the cell membrane and contain at least two transmembrane helical domains. The hole making process is thought to be achieved by holin oligomerization at a specific moment when progeny virions are set to be released.  Efficacy  Phage lysins are generally species or subspecies specific, which means that they are only effective against bacteria from which they were produced. While some lysins only act upon the cell walls of several bacterial phylotypes, some broad- spectrum lysins have been found. Similarly, some thermostable lysins are known, which makes them easier to use in biotechnology. Regarding their use as antibacterial agents, lysins have been found effective mainly against Gram- positive bacteria, since Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane that prevents extracellular lysin molecules from digesting peptidoglycan. However, lysins with activity against Gram-negative bacteria, such as OBPgp279, have garnered interest as potential therapeutics.  Immune response  One of the most problematic aspects of the use of phage lysins as antimicrobial agents is the potential immunogenicity of these enzymes. Unlike most antibiotics, proteins are prone to antibody recognition and binding, which means that lysins could be ineffective when treating bacterial infections or even dangerous, potentially leading to a systemic immune response or a cytokine storm. Nonetheless, experimental data from immunologically-rich rabbit serum showed that hyperimmune serum slows down but does not block the activity of pneumococcal lysin Cpl-1.  Antimicrobial use  Phage lysins have been successfully tested in animal models to control pathogenic antibiotic- resistant bacteria found on mucous membranes and in blood. The main advantage of lysins compared to antibiotics is not only the low bacterial resistance but also the high specificity towards the target pathogen, and low activity towards the host's normal bacterial flora. Lysins were first used therapeutically in animals in 2001, in a publication in which mice orally colonized with Streptococcus pyogenes were decolonized with a single dose of PlyC lysin delivered orally.

Design  The IndoStar-1 geostationary broadcast satellite (the first STAR-1 spacecraft bus) and the Turn-Key Indovision Direct To Home (DTH) program was developed by Thomas van der Heyden. The satellite was built by a team of engineers at the US company Defense Systems Inc. (DSI), which had up until the IndoStar program (later renamed Cakrawarta by the then president of Indonesia - Suharto), focused on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for the US government, DARPA and NASA. Under the contract DSI together with its sister company International Technologies Inc. (ITI) constructed the Indostar-1 satellite program for on-orbit turn-key delivery for the Indonesian television broadcasting company PT Media Citra Indostar (MCI). The Turn-Key, End-to-End contract, which included; Launch, Tracking Telemetry & Control Station, Up- Link Station for 60 MPEG television channels, Integrated Receiver Decoder (IRD) design, ITU regulatory filings, insurance, and spacecraft - was the first fully turn key contract in the commercial satellite industry. In 1995 DSI was sold to Computer Technology Associates (CTA) which was sold two years later to Orbital Sciences Corporation (later Orbital ATK, now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems) during the final stages of the Indostar-1 satellite integration in early 1997. The Indostar-1 satellite design was developed from scratch by Thomas van der Heyden and Dr. George Sebestyen founder of DSI, became the first GEO LightSat, their STAR Bus platform. The Cakrawarta satellite was successfully launched into the geostationary orbital slot located at 107.7 East Longitude above Indonesia by the ArianeSpace 44L launch vehicle on November 12, 1997, co-manifested with the Sirius-2 satellite. IndoStar-1 was the world's first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast (pioneered by van der Heyden), which efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80 cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. Similar performance is not economically feasible with comparable Ku- or C-band DTH satellite systems since more power is required in these bands to penetrate the moist atmosphere. Due to a failed power regulator, two of the satellite's five transponders could not be used at 100% output whenever the satellite was eclipsed by the Earth. During these periods, only 80 percent of the required power was available. The spacecraft, with a design life of seven years, operated successfully for 11 years, providing 60 channels of MPEG-2 digital satellite television to the 235 million people of Indonesia. On Saturday, May 16, 2009, Indovision launched the replacement for the Cakrawarta-1 (IndoStar-1) satellite - Indostar-2 (now SES-7) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It became operational in July 2009 and IndoStar-1 was subsequently decommissioned.  Mission  IndoStar-1 was managed and operated by PT Media Citra Indostar (MCI), providing a direct broadcast signal by high quality digital transmission. Operationally, IndoStar-1 satellite was used for commercial services by cable television companies to relay international and local programs throughout Indonesia. Indovision used this satellite before switching to IndoStar-2.

His responsibilities include day-to-day operations at Little Caesars Arena. He was also involved in the operations of Cobo Arena until Olympia Entertainment relinquished management in 2011 and Joe Louis Arena until it closed for good in 2017. Sobotka is known mostly for driving the Zamboni during Detroit Red Wings games for the past 30 years and for collecting the octopuses thrown on the ice during Red Wings playoff games. The official mascot of the Red Wings is named after Sobotka. Sobotka came in second with 97,261 votes in Zamboni News' 1999 Zamboni \\"Driver of the Year\\" Award. Sobotka's role as Zamboni driver Sobotka had been driving the Zamboni between periods at Joe Louis Arena for over 30 years until the arena's closure in the spring 2017 and currently drives the Zamboni between periods at the new Little Caesars Arena, beginning in the fall 2017. He is known for taking pride in his work, and he ensures that the arena's ice surface is of the highest quality. He said: \\"You know I'm particular, so if I see anything that's wrong -- a little chip of snow or something, you know, all that stuff matters a lot, 'cause a little snow can freeze and a guy hits it, never know what can happen, you know?\\" Brendan Shanahan said of Sobotka: \\"Al's very good and he takes it personally. I mean we see him a lot. Everybody knows Al. We're able to go out and make comments to him. He'll know when there's a tough night, you know, in the playoffs, or if it's a humid day and he'll respond accordingly. He'll ask the players after the game, 'What'd you think of the ice?'\\" Detroit fans often arrive before game time to watch Sobotka prepare the ice for a game. Also, kids can compete to drive around with Sobotka between periods. They learn that driving a Zamboni is no simple task, and that ice preparation is both science and an art that can take years to perfect. Sobotka started driving the Zamboni early in life, and when asked about his \\"dream job\\", he said: \\"It was just a job I got when I was in high school, and I kept at it, working in the maintenance department for a few years, [and] I still enjoy getting up in the morning. If you don't enjoy your work, it's hard getting up in the morning, you know?\\" Dealing with octopuses Sobotka is also famous for being the employee responsible for handling any octopuses thrown on the ice during a game. Sobotka will grab the octopus with his bare hands and swing it around his head. He typically receives an appreciative cheer from the crowd for this response. In the April 2006 edition of Sports Illustrated, Michael Farber wrote: > The first face-offs [of the Stanley Cup tournament] were in Ottawa and > Detroit at 7:12 p.m., although the unofficial commencement occurred two > minutes earlier when an octopus landed on the ice with a splat during 'The > Star-Spangled Banner' at the Wings' Joe Louis Arena.

Sobotka said in 1996 that an unofficial record of 54 octopuses were thrown during one game of the 1995 Stanley Cup final series between Detroit Red Wings and New Jersey Devils. He also stated that Detroit fans throw an average of 25 octopuses per playoff game. For his tireless efforts, the Red Wings named their octopus mascot \\"Al\\" after Sobotka. According to NHL rules, if any fan throws an object on the ice in celebration, the supported team could be issued a delay of game penalty. However, the NHL tends to look the other way when Sobotka does his stuff. Frank Brown, the league's vice president for media relations, said in response: \\"Every so often, an octopus slips out of someone's hands, and Al is right there to take care of the matter. And he cannot be blamed if, as it tries to break free from Al's grasp, the octopus lifts Al's arm and twirls itself in the air.\\" In the 2008 playoffs, the NHL issued a warning that while they were fine with octopuses being thrown on the ice, the Red Wings would be fined $10,000 if Sobotka twirled the octopus in the air, as bits of the octopus were getting in the ice and on the opposing goaltender. However, it was announced on May 7, 2008, that the NHL would allow Sobotka to twirl the octopuses, provided that he does so only at the Zamboni gate and not on the ice surface.

Cotton wool spots are an abnormal finding on funduscopic exam of the retina of the eye. They appear as fluffy white patches on the retina. They are caused by damage to nerve fibers and are a result of accumulations of axoplasmic material within the nerve fiber layer. There is reduced axonal transport (and hence backlog and accumulation of intracellular products) within the nerves because of the ischemia. This then causes the nerve fibers to be damaged by swelling in the surface layer of the retina. A 1981 analysis concluded that \\"in most instances, cotton-wool spots do not represent the whole area of ischaemic inner retina but merely reflect the obstruction of axoplasmic flow in axons crossing into much larger ischaemic areas\\". Associated findings include microvascular infarcts and hemorrhages. The appearance of cotton wool spots may decrease over time. Abundant cotton wool spots are seen in Malignant hypertension. Diabetes and hypertension are the two most common diseases that cause these spots, and the best treatment would be to treat the underlying disease. In diabetes they are one of the hallmarks of pre-proliferative retinopathy. More rarely, HIV and Purtscher's retinopathy can also lead to the appearance of cotton wool spots.

In St. Petersburg, where he was born, he attended a classical high school; he went on to attend the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, the University of Strasbourg, and the Saint Petersburg State University (MA 1910, LLD 1914). At the latter university he met the Polish-Russian jurist Leon Petrazycki, who was a significant influence on him throughout his life.A. Javier Trevi√±o, introduction to Nicholas S. Timasheff, An Introduction to the Sociology of Law (Transaction Publishers, 1939: ), p. xi. Two years later he began teaching sociological jurisprudence at the University of Petrograd. He emigrated to the United States following an alleged involvement with the Tagantsev Conspiracy in 1920. He took up a similar position at Fordham University, and was one of the original developers of the discipline of sociology of law. Timasheff was the author of various works, including The Great Retreat: The Growth and Decline of Communism in Russia (New York, 1946), in which he argued that the Bolsheviks made a conscious retreat from socialist values during the 1930s, instead returning to traditional ones like patriotism and the family. Historian Terry Martin considers this a misnomer, because \\"in the political and economic spheres, the period after 1933 marked a consolidation, rather than a repudiation, of the most important goals of Stalin's socialist offensive: forced industrialization, collectivization, nationalization, abolition of the market, political dictatorship.\\"Terry Martin, The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939 (Cornell University Press, 2001: ), p. 415.

They historically lived in the area of Sadiya, Joidaam, Patkai foothills and in the upper plains or also called as the hinterland of the Brahmaputra Valley. Concrete documented records about the history of the tribe is very limited. Scanty information was found in few books and official records. The Deori community belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family of Mongoloid stock. Census of India: Part 1, p. 127., p.30. The community has maintained their racial traits, language, religion, folktales and traditional beliefs through the centuries.Sharma, S.K. Discovery of Northeast India: Volume 2. Mittal Publications,2005, p. 81. They were divided into Jimochayan/Dibang- Diyongial(Dibongia), Midoyan/Tengapania, Luitugan/Borgoya.Deoram, L.D.,Study of Mishing and Deori Community,p. 50. The native language is retained only by the Dibongia group. History History says that the homeland of the Deoris was in the eastern regions of undivided Assam. As per the folklore of the tribe, they are settlers of the area of Joidaam and Patkai foothills and upper valley of Brahmaputra. During Burmese (Maan as called by Deoris) aggression (1817-1826) the tribe lost a lot of lives. Many slaughtered and many taken as captive. Again the destructive earthquake of 1869 devasted the whole community. The uncertainty about future prevailed amongst those who floated down in the river using bamboo and banana plant made raft. They migrated to different places alongside the rivers they floated down. As they entered and landed in their new territory, they took the name of that particular river as their clan name. Deoris under the ruler of the new land had followed the law of the land. Those Deoris who migrated to places with less interest and influence of the outside rulers had followed their culture and traditions and continued their dialect. Some experts claim that the Patorgoyan clan assimilated with the Tiwa tribe in central Assam but there has been no scientific evidence to support the claim, which prompted a section of Deoris to begin a search. A preliminary investigation from 30 September to 5 October under the aegis of Jimachaya Giyan Aru Juktibadi Samaj has given a positive indication of the presence of Deori people in Kachin province and near Yangon in Myanmar. A team of researchers has decided to visit Myanmar in search of the lost clan.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/to-myanmar- in-search-of-a-lost-clan-of-the-deoris-tribe-of-assam/article6485876.ece Most of the people of Dibongiya class can speak their own mother tongue along with Assamese, but the rest of the 3 other classes/clans ( except few elderly persons) only understand and speak Assamese as their mother tongue. The three classes of Deoris live in the districts mentioned above. Language The Deori language is one of the languages of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Deori language is mainly spoken in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Over the years, Deori speakers, barring the Dibongia clan which uses it rigorously, have shifted to speaking the Assamese language, which can be attributed to the Language shift phenomenon. Deori society=Deori clans The people of Deori tribe are mainly divided into four groups or clans, namely Dibongia, Bor-geeya, Tengaponiya and Pator-goya. The entire people of each main clan or main group are again subdivided into several sub-clans or sub-groups. The word \\"sub-clan\\" or \\"sub-group\\" is called \\"Boja\\" or \\"Bahor\\" in Deori language. Some of the commonly known sub-clan are like Ariya, Kumotaya, Bihiya, Naroda, Sundhariya, Patriya, Dupiya, Marangya, Chariya, Lagasuya, Chitigaya, Mehedaya, Kuliya, Khutiya/Buruk, Machiya, Bikomiya, Phaporiya, Fagimegia, Senaboriya, Chakucharu, Ekacharul/Busaru, Simocharu, Hizaru, Popharu, Gucharu etc.http://www.deori.in/Sociallife.html Each Deori people wants to know or wants to inform about their main clan and sub-clan (sub-group) in their first introduction. Otherwise, their introduction remains incomplete.

The church was bombed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1974‚Äì1975 as a church museum. This museum closed in 2007 and the building was used by the city council as offices; in 2018 the church came back into use as an Anglican place of worship in the Diocese of Bristol. History The first church was founded before 1154, with a chancel extending over the south gate of the city. The gate and old church were demolished to make way for the rebuilding of Bristol Bridge, and the church was rebuilt in 1762‚Äì1769 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th-century crypt. The interior was destroyed by bombing in the Bristol Blitz of 1940 and rebuilt in 1974‚Äì1975 as a church museum. This closed in 2007 and the building was used by the city council as offices. The building still holds statues of King Edward I and King Edward III which were removed from Arno's Court Triumphal Arch. The original statues were taken from Bristol's Lawfords' Gate that was demolished around 1760. Other statues are 13th-century figures from Bristol's Newgate representing Robert, the builder of Bristol Castle, and Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances, builder of the fortified walls of Bristol. They were moved to the church, due to their deteriorating condition, in 1898. It also holds one of only two public commissions by Hogarth,M J H Liversidge, William Hogarth's Bristol Altar- piece, University of Bristol (Bristol branch of the Historical Association), 1980 the tripartite altarpiece (Bristol Museum ref K2429-K2431), Sealing the Tomb which was originally painted for St Mary Redcliffe Church in 1755. The painting remained at St Mary Redcliffe until 1858, when the Victorian community mounted a campaign to remove those furnishings which were not in keeping with the church's original Gothic character. The three paintings were sold for ¬£20 to the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of the Fine Arts (later to become the Royal West of England Academy). In 1910 their sale was again proposed, prompting the Bristol Times and Mirror to comment \\"Bristol will be looked upon as one of those places which prefer hard cash to art treasures\\" (Bristol Times and Mirror, 22 February 1910). In 1955 the paintings were passed over to Bristol Museum and Art Gallery and restored whilst residing in St Nicholas' church. The building has been designated as a grade II* listed building. Present day In January 2018, it was announced that St Nicholas' church would be re-opened by the Church of England and used for worship once more. It will be part of the HTB network, having been planted by Holy Trinity Brompton. The church was re-opened on 30 September 2018. The first service for 60 years, was on Sunday 9 December 2018.

Frank Baum, about a living gingerbread man and his adventures. It was illustrated by John R. Neill and published in 1906 by the Reilly & Britton Company. The story was serialized in the Washington Sunday Star and other newspapers from October to December 1906. Like the Oz books but unlike many of the author's other works, John Dough was issued under Baum's name rather than one of his pseudonyms. The book was popular; as late as 1919 it was selling 1500 copies a year.Rogers (2002), p. 230. The 1974 Dover Publications edition features an introduction by Martin Gardner. Gender ambiguity Throughout his text, Baum is careful never to specify the sex of his character Chick the Cherub, even to the point of referring to Chick as \\"it\\" instead of \\"he\\" or \\"she.\\" Chick dresses in androgynous pajamas; Neill pictures Chick in a Buster Brown haircut that could fit either a boy or a girl. The publishers wanted Baum to resolve the ambiguity, but he refused. Eventually they made the best of the situation: in the publicity campaign for the original edition, Reilly & Britton conducted a contest in which the book's child readers could vote on Chick's sex. The children who gave the best answers, in 25 words or less, won prizes.Rogers (2002), p. 142. The contest was presented as a detachable form in front of the first edition of the book, to be detached, filled out, and mailed to the publisher; first editions with the contest-page intact are rare collectors' items. The contest's second-place prize was won by a boy who read the story in the Seattle Times. His entry read, \\"The Cherub was a girl because if it had been a boy he would have eaten the ginger-bread man at once whether it agreed with him or not.\\"Fitch-Brewer (1913), p. 95. Synopsis The story begins in the bakery of Jules and Leontine Grogrande, French immigrants to the United States. Their mysterious local customer, Ali Dubh the Arab, comes to the bakery one day with an urgent request. He is being pursued by three of his countrymen, because he possesses the Great Elixir ‚Äî \\"the Essence of Vitality, the Water of Life.\\" A mere drop of this liquid can endow a person with pronounced health, strength, and longevity. Ali Dubh pleads with Madame Grogrande to hide the golden vial of the Elixir for him; she is reluctant, but relents when the Arab also provides her with a silver vial that contains a cure for her rheumatism. In addition to being rheumatic, however, Leontine is also colorblind; she confuses the gold and silver bottles. She pours the Great Elixir into a bowl of water and bathes her sore limbs in it. Instantly the pain is gone, and she feels \\"as light and airy as a fairy...It occurred to her that she would like to dance; to run and shout, to caper about as she used to do as a girl.\\" Since she is a sensible older woman, she goes to bed instead, leaving the bowl of diluted elixir in the kitchen. Her husband Jules comes into the bakery at 3:00 AM; it is the Fourth of July, and he decides to bake a large gingerbread man to display in his store window. He mixes his dough ‚Äì and uses the water in the bowl, which contains the elixir, at hand. He forms a gingerbread figure the size of a \\"fourteen-year-old boy,\\" but in the shape and appearance of a \\"typical French gentleman.\\" Jules gives the figure glass eyes, white candies for teeth, and lozenges for his suitcoat buttons. He bakes the gingerbread man in his oven ‚Äì and is astonished to find that the figure comes to life when done. The full dose of the Great Elixir has endowed John Dough the gingerbread man not only with life, but with intelligence and multilingual speech. Jules flees in panic; John Dough equips himself with the baker's top hat and a candy-cane cane, and sets out to see the world. Ali Dubh is outraged when he learns what has happened; but he also sees a solution for his problem. He simply needs to eat the gingerbread man to gain the benefits of the elixir. With that realization, the Arab sets out in pursuit of John Dough. On the evening of the Fourth, John Dough accidentally hitches a ride on a large rocket launched during the festivities. The rocket carries him all the way to the Isle of Phreex; John falls from the sky onto a Fresh-Air Fiend, who was, naturally, sleeping outdoors. On Phreex, John encounters a cavalcade of odd beings; most importantly, he meets the cryptic figure of Chick the Cherub, \\"the first and only Original Incubator Baby.\\" Though only six years old (or eight, depending on who is counting), Chick is a slang-talker, brave and even- tempered. Chick becomes John's friend, companion, and protector in a strange new world. The inhabitants of Phreex ‚Äî \\"the Freaks of Phreex,\\" as they are called ‚Äì are a wildly diverse lot. Among the more memorable are: an animated Wooden Indian; a girl executioner who never gets to kill anybody and weeps over the fact; a two-legged talking horse that bullies its rider; and the youthful and tyrannical \\"Kinglet\\" of Phreex. The Isle is also the home of crank inventors. One of them, the least cranky of the lot, has created a workable flying machine. Once Ali Dubh shows up on Phreex (he purchased a magic spell from a witch to magically follow his quarry), John and Chick depart in the flying machine for parts unknown. Their first stop is a small island that contains the Palace of Romance. There, the heroes fall into a Sheherazade predicament: they need to keep telling stories to avoid being killed. They soon make their escape in the flying machine, which crashes onto another island of strange creatures. They meet Pittypat, a talking white rabbit, and Para Bruin, a big and bouncing rubber bear. The mifkets, who also inhabit the island, are malicious gnome-like beings who cause the protagonists major problems. Things get worse when Ali Dubh shows up and reveals to the Mifkets that John Dough is good to eat. The mifkets capture John and eat all the fingers of one of his hands before he is able to escape. John sacrifices the rest of his mutilated hand to save the life of a pretty young girl trapped on the island, who is wasting away; his elixir-rich gingerbread flesh saves her life. Pittypat the rabbit introduces the heroes to the King of the Fairy Beavers, who accepts them into his subterranean domain and resolves their difficulties with his magic. The girl is restored to her parents; John and Chick, joined by Para Bruin, are borne into the sky by friendly flamingoes. After a brief and unpleasant stop on Pirate Island, the flamingoes carry the three adventurers to their final destination. (Ali Dubh is left stranded on the mifket island; his witch-bought transportation spell was good for two uses only.) The twin countries of Hiland and Loland occupy opposite halves of an island, separated by a high wall and a large and richly-furnished castle. The people of Hiland are tall and thin, and they live in tall thin houses; those of Loland are short and stout, with dwellings to match. The king who ruled the two lands has died, and both peoples await the arrival of a prophesied, non- human replacement. John Dough fits the bill, and he becomes the new King of Hiland and Loland. A local baker repairs the damage John has endured in his travels. Para Bruin becomes Chief Counselor, while the Cherub promotes itself to Head Booleywag ‚Äî \\"the one that rules the ruler.\\" Together, the three manage very well for many years to come ‚Äî but the annals of Hiland and Loland never state whether Chick, the Head Booleywag, is male or female. Baum's fantasy cosmos In 1905, Baum had published his most \\"classic\\" fairy tale, Queen Zixi of Ix. With John Dough in the following year, Baum returned to the unique hybrid fantasy world of his Oz books and related works. Like Dorothy Gale, John Dough can travel (by air) from a contemporary United States (c. 1900) to extraordinary countries of the imagination; the types of creatures he meets are those of the world of Oz ‚Äì fairies, talking animals, and animated artificial beings (scarecrow; wooden Indian). Chick the Cherub is another of Baum's unrealistically free-spirited and fearless child protagonists. The Great Elixir is comparable to the Powder of Life that is a key element in Baum's fantasy domain. Baum mixes technology into his Oz fantasies and into John Dough as well; aircraft and incubators were recent developments in 1906. The divided country of Hiland and Loland foreshadows the similarly divided country of Sky Island (1912). The \\"fairy beavers\\" are a kind of animal spirit Baum employs in his The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus.Rogers (2002), p. 51. The gem-encrusted underground realm of the fairy beavers resembles the domain of the Nome King in the Oz books. John Dough, Chick the Cherub, and Para Bruin make cameo appearances in the fifth Oz book, The Road to Oz (1909). A mifket makes a brief appearance in the tenth Oz book, Rinkitink in Oz (1916). Jack Snow used characters from the story of John Dough in his 1949 book The Shaggy Man of Oz.Greene; Martin (1977), p. 79. Adaptations The novel has been adapted into film twice, both under the direction of Otis Turner, first as a 40-minute segment of The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays (1908), then again as a ten-minute short in 1910. Both of these films are lost.

Koga, Ibaraki) Born in Tokyo, Nagai graduated from the Tokyo Women's University with a degree in Japanese literature in 1944. She also studied economy history at the University of Tokyo from 1947 to 1948. After her marriage to the Nobuo Kuroita, the son of historian Kuroita Katsumi, she went to work for the Shogakukan Publishing Company as an editor, but began to write her own stories with historical settings on the side. In 1952, she submitted her debut work, Sanjoin ki (\\"History of Lady Sanjo\\") to the Sunday Mainichi, where it was awarded second place in the 30th anniversary commemorative edition of that publication. This encouraged her to pursue a career in literature full-time, winning the prestigious Naoki Award in 1964, the 21st Women's Culture Award in 1981, the 32nd Kikuchi Award in 1984 and the Yoshikawa Eiji Literary Award in 1987. She is noted for historical novels reassessing the role of women in Japanese history. She is praised for combining historical accuracy with translating her characters emotions into modern terms. In Masako, she countered popular image of Minamoto no Yoritomo's jealous, power-grasping wife H≈çj≈ç Masako (1157‚Äì1225) with a more human, sympathetic personality. Her novel was the basis for a yearlong television drama on the Japanese government television network NHK, in 1979. Likewise, in Gin no yakata (\\"Silver Mansion\\", 1980) she rehabilitated the image of Hino Tomiko (1440‚Äì1496), wife of the ineffectual sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa. Historically scorned as an \\"evil money- grubbing woman\\" who dragged the country into war, Nagai's portrayal is of a woman who is savior of the government, and who is skilled at finance and politics. However, her writing was not entirely on the role of women. In 1997, NHK aired a year-long historical drama in 50 episodes, M≈çri Motonari, on the life of the Sengoku-period daimy≈ç, based on Nagai's book of the same name.

Etymology  The generic name is derived from the Greek word asaphes, meaning \\"indistinct.\\"  Description  A. plautini, enrolledThe headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) are semicircular and without a border (defined by a furrow or a change in convexity parallel to its margin). The cephalon is of approximately equal size as the pygidium (or isopygous). The central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is long, reaching the frontal margin. It may have faint lateral glabellar furrows or be smooth, and sometimes an inconspicuous tubercle is present just in front of the hardly discernible occipital ring. The natural fracture lines (sutures) of the head run along the top edges of the compound eye. From the back of the eye these cut to the back of the head (or is said to be opisthoparian) and not to the side. The free cheeks (or librigenae) are separated from each other anteriorly by a suture at the midline. The corner between the side and the back of the cephalon (or genal angle) is rounded or (in a few species) pointed into spines. Eyes holochroal, commonly more or less conical, short or moderate in length. In some evolution lines, the visual surface of the eye is raised on a stalk. The lateral corners of the palate (or hypostome), visual from the ventral side, are more or less protruding, and the posterior part is forked with two triangular teeth. The reflexed margin of the exoskeleton (or doublure) is broad. The articulate midlength part of the body (or thorax) consists of 8 segments. Furrows in the parts outside the axis (or pleural furrows) are diagonal. The pygidium is rounded, and has a long axis with concave, posteriorly parallel sides.

MTAB is a wholly owned subsidiary of the mining company Luossavaara‚ÄìKiirunavaara (LKAB). In Norway, operations are handled by the subsidiary Malmtrafikk AS (MTAS). Malmtrafik hauls ore from LKAB's mines in Kiruna, Malmberget and Svappavaara to the ports of Lule√• and Narvik, the latter located in Norway. The company owns 28 Iore locomotives and 750 hopper cars. Each train is 68 cars long and weighs , allowing the company to transport 33 million tonnes per year. Traditionally the ore hauling had been done by the Swedish State Railways (SJ) and Norwegian State Railways (NSB). In the late 1980s, LKAB started a process to take over operations and increase efficiency by using heavier and longer trains. Because of the profitability in the operations, especially NSB was reluctant to lose the operations. In 1993, LKAB received permission to operate their own trains in Sweden, and from 1996 in Norway. MTAB and MTAS were created in 1996 when they took over the hauling formerly operated by NSB and SJ. It inherited Dm3 and El 15 locomotives. Originally established as a joint venture between LKAB, NSB and SJ, with the mining company as a majority owner, LKAB bought the whole company in 1999. By 2011, the renewal process will be finished, and only trains pulled by Iore will be in operation.  History  Dm3 in Narvik Background In 1884, LKAB's predecessor Gellivare Aktiebolag is granted concession for mining in Malmberget. Four years later, the first part of the Iron Ore Line, from Malmberget to Lule√•, was completed. In 1889, the mining company filed for bankruptcy, and the Government of Sweden bought the line for 8 million Swedish krona (SEK), half the investment cost. Construction of the Ore Line and Ofoten Line from G√§llivare to Narvik started in 1898 and was completed in 1902. In 1915, the section from Kiruna to Riksgr√§nsen (on the Norway‚ÄìSweden border) is electrified, and by 1923 the whole section from Narvik to Lule√• is electrified. In 1940, the Port of Narvik was bombed, and all export for the remainder of World War II went via Lule√•. In 1957, the Government of Sweden bought LKAB. Hauling of the ore trains along the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line has traditionally been operated by the two state railways, SJ and NSB, who have sold their services directly to LKAB. With dwindling profits in LKAB during the early 1980s, in 1983 LKAB used an arbitration to reduce its transport costs to SJ from 310 to 235 million per year, with subsequent discounts achieved with NSB. In 1988, LKAB demanded further efficiency improvement, and stated that both SJ and NSB were making large profits on the operations. A committee was established by both countries' transport ministries to find areas of improvement. During the 1970s and 1980s, the number of employees working on the ore logistics had been halved, and NSB stated that they did not believe there was much more room for higher efficiency. NSB had a 50% profit margin on the operations. Establishment Ore Line and the Ofoten Line In December 1991, LKAB stated that they wanted to take over the operation of the ore trains from NSB and SJ. At the time, they were paying 0.15 Swedish krona (SEK) per tonne kilometer in Sweden and 0.30 Norwegian krone (NOK) per tonne kilometer in Norway, while comparable rates abroad were between SEK 0.03 and 0.10 per tonne kilometer. While SJ had several times during the 1980s agreed to reduce their rates, NSB had not offered the same, and was making a profit of NOK 60 to 70 million per year. LKAB stated that they, by taking over operations themselves, could save SEK 200 million per year. In addition, they stated that they could save between SEK 50 to 100 million in auxiliary fields. LKAB had sent an application to Swedish authorities for permission to take over operations, and had received positive feedback from SJ. NSB, on the other hand, did not support a solution where they did not operate the trains themselves. LKAB stated that if an agreement with NSB could not be reached, they would shift all their transport to the Port of Lule√•. In February 1992, a report ordered by Kiruna Municipality recommended that LKAB, SJ and NSB create a common company to operate the ore trains. At the same time, SJ stated that the consequence of LKAB taking over operation could be that passenger trains on the lines would be terminated. In April 1992, LKAB was awarded traffic rights by the Swedish Rail Administration. There was a disagreement as to whether the agency had the authority to do this, and SJ stated that it was only the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications who had the authority to award traffic rights on the stem lines, in particular from Boden to Lule√•. The rights also did not affect the Ofoten Line. The following day, SJ and NSB stated that they were considering establishing a joint venture that would take over the operations of the ore trains. In May, LKAB stated that Norway would, through its membership in the European Economic Area, be required to allow any train operator to run trains on a line, while this was rejected by NSB who stated that this only applied within the European Union, of which Norway was not a member. In late May, NSB stated that they were able to cut costs by 25% and that they would reduce the price to LKAB more than this. LKAB rejected the proposal, and stated that NSB had shown their ability of restructuring too late. By August, SJ and NSB had offered to reduce the price from SEK 650 million to 450 million, but LKAB stated that they believed it was possible to reduce the costs further. LKAB's facilities at the Port of Narvik In September, Norwegian Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Opseth from the Labour Party, stated that it would be \\"unfortunate\\" if LKAB should take over the operations. The Swedish Government stated that it was their intention to privatize LKAB. On 18 September, 3,000 in Narvik held a general strike against LKAB's plans. At the time it was not possible for NSB to fire redundant employees, at that the state agency would have to continue to pay their Narvik employees who would not be hired by LKAB, should the latter take over operations. In October the Swedish Ministry of Communications gave the final permission for LKAB to take over operations in their own right. On 26 October, SJ and NSB signed a new five-year contract with LKAB where the latter would purchase transport services from the two state railway. The annual price had then been reduced from SEK 650 to 400 million. Political commentators stated that the agreement allowed LKAB to keep all the profit in the line and introduce new cost savings, while SJ and NSB kept face by keeping the operating contract. The price reduction would mean that both NSB and SJ would have to lay off employees. Hopper cars in Kiruna In 1993, the state railways were losing money on the ore trains. In January 1994, SJ and NSB stated that they were going to merge the operations of the Iron Ore Line and the Ofoten Line. In May 1994, LKAB applied for traffic rights on the Ofoten Line. This was rejected in December by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that the company did not meet the criteria in the law, including that the applicant had to have rail transport as their main activity. In January 1995, it was proposed that a joint venture would be created between LKAB, SJ and NSB. The Norwegian Union of Railway Workers protested the proposal, and the Norwegian Centre Party stated that their feared this was the first step into converting NSB to a limited company. By February the negotiations were in a deadlock, and SJ and NSB stated that they were issuing an invitation to tender for a new class of locomotives. In March, LKAB again applied for permit to operate their own trains in Norway and stated that they would only join a joint venture if they were the majority owner. On 8 June, LKAB established a Swedish and a Norwegian subsidiary dedicated to rail transport. This would bypass the rationale provided by the Ministry of Transport in denying them traffic rights, and LKAB stated that there was no way the Norwegian authorities now could deny them such rights, given EU Directive 91/440. T44 locomotive shunting ore cars at the Port of Narvik On 27 June, LKAB, SJ and NSB reached an agreement where the three would establish a joint venture owned 51% by LKAB and 24.5% each by NSB and SJ. At the time there were 350 employees in the three companies involved in the transport, and the new company would recruit its employees among these, although it would need significantly fewer employees. The plans called for the new companies taking over operations from 1 January 1996. The organization was protested by local labor unions in Narvik. In December, Kjell Opseth created a committee under the ministry, led by State Secretary Torstein Rudihagen of the Labour Party, which would look at the reorganization, thus postponing the date of the start of operations. In late January, the committee concluded that LKAB met the criteria to receive traffic rights. The report also showed that 55 jobs would be lost in Narvik and that the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had concerns regarding the safety of LKAB's operations. In Sweden, the labor unions protested after LKAB demanded that the employees switch union from Swedish Union for Service and Communications Employees to the Swedish Metalworkers Union. This was rejected by the workers, who would both have to reduce their pay and work five more years before retirement. In May the Opseth stated that the Norwegian Government would give the necessary rights to the joint venture. At the same time, the state would give Narvik Municipality economic support and real estate for commercial development. With Malktrafik's take-over, 50 employees, equally distributed between the two countries, became redundant. On 28 May, 22 train drivers, all Swedish, took out sick leave in protest towards being forced to switch labor union and receive lower wages and worse pension rights. This caused a third of the ore trains to be canceled. Twin Iore locomotives in G√§llivare On 28 June, the transfer of operations was finalized when the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Progress Party voted in the Parliament of Norway, with 67 against 45 votes, to grant Malmtrafik the necessary rights. The Centre Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Left Party, the Liberal Party and the Red Electoral Alliance voted against. NSB's workshop and depot were to be transferred to a new company, Norsk Verkstedindustri, which was intended to create new jobs in Narvik. Heavier trains Malmtrafik took over operations from 1 July. The company bought the Dm3-locomotives from SJ, NSB's six El 15 locomotives, and a number of workshops, depots and shunters. Post-nationalization, it became the first private railway company in Europe to haul international freight trains. from 26 September to 27 October, 200 employees in Narvik were on strike regarding the transition rules for employees. While the strike lasted, there was increased shipments to Lule√•. In November, the new ore port in Lule√• opened, having cost LKAB more than half a billion Swedish kronor and a capacity of six million tonnes of ore per year. In 1998, LKAB estimated a gradual 35% increase in production until 2005, and demanded that the track owners grant sufficient funding to upgrade the lines from to maximum permitted axle load. Combined with new locomotives, this would give increased efficiency in hauling the ore. The upgrade for the Ofoten Line would cost 180 million Norwegian krone, and would allow LKAB to increase the train weight from . In addition, heavier trains would have to be longer, so sufficient passing loops would have to be upgraded to . A Dm3 triple units In March, LKAB awarded the contract to build 750 new 100-tonne hopper cars to Transnet of South Africa, after among others Norsk Verkstedindustri had been considered. In August, an agreement was reached whereby LKAB would pay for NOK 100 million of the NOK 130 million needed to upgrade the Ofoten Line. The contract to deliver 18 Iore locomotives was signed with Bombardier on 15 September 1998. LKAB bought SJ and NSB's share of MTAB in 1999, making MTAB a subsidiary. The first twin unit locomotive was delivered in 2000, and serial delivery was made from 2002 to 2004. In 2003, the Iron Ore Line from Kiruna to Riskgr√§nsen and the Ofoten Line were finished upgraded to 30 tonne axle load, allowing half the trains to operate with maximum capacity. In March 2004, LKAB decided to not purchase the option for additional hopper cars from Transnet, and instead purchase 750 heavier cars from K-Industrier. Since 1969 the ore trains have been using the Soviet SA3 coupler. However, LKAB decided that these were not sufficiently strong for the new trains and decided that the Iore locomotives and the new hopper cars were to be delivered with Janney couplers (also known as AAR coupler). While the first pair of locomotives had a Janney couplers, the rest of the first batch were equipped with SA3 couplers to handle the existing hopper cars, and then retrofitted with Janney couplers only to revert to SA3 later.L√•nga t√•g Willison vs AAR (Swedish; 11 March 2014) On 23 August 2007, LKAB ordered another four twin units, with delivery in 2010 and 2011, and costing ‚Ç¨52 million. This will replace all remaining Dm3. After delivery, six locomotives are used from Kiruna to Lule√•, and twenty are used from Kiruna to Narvik. By 2009, sufficient passing loops had been built along the whole line from Narvik to Lule√• to allow all trains to operate with full capacity. By 2011, LKAB's will be able to replace all the Dm3, and convert all the coal trains to 68 cars. This will increase the capacity from 28 to 33 million tonnes per year, and at the same time reduce the number of departures per day from 21 to 15. Rolling stock An Iore hauling an ore train near Tornetr√§sk Iore Iore is a class of 26 modified TRAXX locomotive built by Bombardier Transportation between 2000 and 2011. Operating in pairs, each locomotive has a power output of , a tractive effort of and a maximum dynamic braking effort is . The locomotives have a Co'Co' wheel arrangement, are long, tall and wide. Each locomotive weighs , of which is electrical equipment. Each locomotive has of dead weight to increase the locomotive's weight to the maximum axle weight, and further weight increase has been achieved by making the walls wide with armored steel. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. Hopper cars Malmtrafik operates 750 hopper cars from two different manufacturers: Transnet and K-Industrier. Each hopper car has a loading capacity of , with a maximum permitted axle load of . Each train has 68 cars, although Malmtrafik has ordered six spare cars for each train. There are seven sets of cars for the Northern Circuit. The cars use a Janney coupler. Former locomotives A pair of El 15 hauling an ore train The Dm3 are a class of triple-locomotives delivered to SJ between 1952 and 1970.Aspenberg (2001), p. 96 Each triple unit had a power output of and a 1'D+D+D'1 wheel arrangement. The locomotives were built by ASEA and Motala Verkstad. Each section is long and weighs .Aspenberg (2001), p. 88 The trains will be phased out with the delivery of the last Iore locomotives. Six El 15 were delivered to NSB in 1967 and remained in use by Malmtrafik until 2004. They have a power output of and a Co'Co' wheel arrangement, and hauled ore trains in pairs. They were built by Thune, with the electrical components made by Per Kure. Each locomotive weighs and is long. The train is a more powerful adaption of the Swedish Rc locomotive. While the trains are as powerful as Iore, they have a lower tractive effort.Aspenberg (2001), p. 106‚Äì108 Operation LKAB operates iron ore mines in Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget in Norrbotten County, Sweden. Most of the output is transported by rail to the ice-free Port of Narvik, a route named the Northern Circuit. The Port of Narvik has a capacity for 25 million tonnes per year of ore and allows ships of up to 250,000 deadweight tonnes (DWT). A minority of the ore is transported to the Port of Lule√•, on a route named the Southern Circuit. Located on the Baltic Sea, ore via Lule√• is shipped to Baltic customers, or delivered to furnaces operated by SSAB in Lule√• and Oxel√∂sund. The Port of Lule√• has a capacity of 10 million tonnes per year, and allows ships up to 60,000 DWT. The Bay of Bothnia is covered in ice from January through May, and access to the port is secured through ice breakers. The Ore and Ofoten Lines are long, including the branch to Svappavaara, with the route from Kiruna to Narvik being , and from Malmberget to Lule√• being . Operations are Malmtrafik i Kiruna (MTAB) in Sweden and by Malmtrafikk (MTAS) in Norway. Daily there operate 11 to 13 trains in each direction on the Norther Circuit, and five to six trains on the Southern Circuit. The trains hauled by Iore have 68 cars, are long and weigh . The full ore trains operate at , while the empty return trains operate at . Although the trains and hopper cars are all owned by LKAB, the Iron Ore Line is owned by the Swedish Transport Administration and the Ofoten Line by Bane NOR. The lines are single track, electrified at and have automatic train protection. The Ore and Ofoten Lines are both also used by passenger and container trains. Malmtrafik's haulage constitutes the majority of train cargo in Norway, measured in tonnes, although not in tonne kilometers.

Visitors are taken through the dioramas in small carriages equipped with speakers. It was created by the York Archaeological Trust in 1984. Its name is derived from J√≥rv√≠k, the Old Norse name for the city of York.  Background  Under a glass floor, the original archeological dig is reproduced with actual timbers In the 1850s confectioner Thomas Craven acquired a site in Coppergate. When he died in 1862 his widow Mary Ann Craven continued the business and a century later, in 1966, Cravens relocated to a new factory on the outskirts of the city. Between 1976 and 1981, after the old factory was demolished, and prior to the building of the Coppergate Shopping Centre (an open-air pedestrian shopping centre which now occupies the enlarged site), the York Archaeological Trust, a charity founded in 1972 by Peter Addyman, conducted extensive excavations in the area. Well-preserved remains of some of the timber buildings of the Viking city of Jorv√≠k were discovered, along with workshops, fences, animal pens, privies, pits and wells, together with durable materials and artefacts of the time, such as pottery, metalwork and bones. Unusually, wood, leather, textiles, and plant and animal remains from the period around 900 AD, were also discovered to be preserved in oxygen-deprived wet clay. In all, over 40,000 objects were recovered. The trust recreated the excavated part of Jorvik on the site, peopled with figures, sounds and smells, as well as pigsties, fish market and latrines, with a view to bringing the Viking city fully to life using innovative interpretative methods. The Jorvik Viking Centre, which was designed by John Sunderland, opened in April 1984. Since its formation, the Centre has had close to 20 million visitors.  Today  \\"Wilkom in Jorvik\\" says the Viking at the start of the Time Warp Ride Cooking pan in the museum In 2001, the centre was refurbished and enlarged at a cost of ¬£5 million, and a further investment of ¬£1 million followed in February 2010. These investments were used to \\"intensify the message\\" at Jorvik, and included such changes as extending the ride time to 12 minutes, as well as adding more high-tech elements, which included a hike in \\"the technology and animation elements,\\" and increasing \\"the sensory stimuli to include smells, more sounds, heat, cold and damp.\\" Visitors are taken back to 5:30 pm 25 October 975 AD in a time-capsule, and then embark on a tour of a reconstructed Viking settlement which includes voices speaking in Old Norse, as well as aromas and \\"life-like animated figures, made by laser technology from skeletons found on the site.\\" Beyond this is an extensive museum area, which combines an exhibition of some 800 finds from the site with interactive displays and the opportunity to learn about tenth-century life and to discuss it with \\"Viking\\" staff. Among the exhibits is a replica of the Coppergate Helmet, which was found near the site of the centre and is now in the Yorkshire Museum. A new museum was opened on 13 February 2010, coinciding with the start of the annual Viking Festival in York. The centre contains new exhibitions and features. Demonstration of coin making Jorvik Viking models Graham Ibbeson created the lifelike mannequins used in the Jorvik experience. At first the faces of these mannequins were modelled from modern day people. However, through advances in facial reconstruction technology eight new mannequins have now been modelled on skulls found in a Viking age cemetery, although there is no guarantee that the skulls were Norse, and there is the possibility that they were Saxon.  Viking Festival  The centre also organizes an annual Viking Festival that takes place in the second week of February. The festival is set up in tradition of an ancient Viking festival known as \\"Jolablot\\". The festival includes Combat re-enactment involving volunteers from all over the world.  \\"Time Warp\\" experience  Jorvik Viking Centre is not billed as a museum but as an \\"experience\\"; this type of educational representation of the past, known as a \\"Time Warp\\" experience, has become increasingly popular with the creation of Jorvik. It inspired other such sites as the \\"Canterbury Pilgrims Way\\" where visitors can join Geoffrey Chaucer's pilgrimage.  2015 flood damage  The centre was significantly affected by the flooding in Northern England in December 2015 with extensive water damage to the building and exhibits. The most valuable Viking artifacts were moved to prevent damage. The museum reopened on 8 April 2017.  Public response  The Jorvik Viking Centre has been called \\"one of Britain's most popular attractions.\\" The BBC spoke of the \\"Time Warp\\" experience as \\"a new art form\\". The Jorvik Centre has been criticized as a \\"pop-up book view of history\\" and its presentation of the past has been labelled \\"Disney-like\\". Anthony Gaynor, one of the creators of the Centre, responded by stating: \\"We're making history accessible and enjoyable to the general public. You can't do that if you wrap it in a lot of academic foliage.\\" See also * The Lloyds Bank coprolite is exhibited there.

Degiannis had participated in the abortive pro-Republican coup attempt of March 1935, and been dismissed from the navy as a result. He was one of a number of pro- Liberal or left-wing Greeks contacted and recruited by Section D of British intelligence in early 1941, forming an intelligence cell called \\"Prometheus\\" (Œ†œÅŒøŒºŒ∑Œ∏ŒµœçœÇ) under the leadership of Colonel Evripidis Bakirtzis. Due to the German invasion of Greece and the rapid conquest of the country in April‚ÄìMay 1941, the British were not able to organize their clandestine network on a firm basis or provide them with suitable material such as radios. Following the British withdrawal, only the Prometheus group used its transmitter to send information to SOE in Cairo. In early 1942, Bakirtzis was forced to leave Greece because his identity had been revealed to the Germans. Degiannis, along with fellow participants in the 1935 coup Charalambos Koutsogiannopoulos and Dimitris Bardopoulos, was left in charge of the group which was reorganized as \\"Prometheus II\\". The group collected intelligence for the SOE and engaged in a successful sabotage campaign against Axis shipping. He was arrested, tortured and executed by the Germans on 18 June 1943. He was promoted posthumously to Commander. In December 1980 the Hellenic Navy commissioned the La Combattante IIIb-class fast attack craft Ypoploiarchos Degiannis (P 26) in his honour.

In banded storage, all entries within a fixed distance from the diagonal (called half-bandwidth) are stored. In column-oriented skyline storage, only the entries from the first nonzero entry to the last nonzero entry in each column are stored. There is also row oriented skyline storage, and, for symmetric matrices, only one triangle is usually stored. Skyline storage has become very popular in the finite element codes for structural mechanics, because the skyline is preserved by Cholesky decomposition (a method of solving systems of linear equations with a symmetric, positive-definite matrix; all fill-in falls within the skyline), and systems of equations from finite elements have a relatively small skyline. In addition, the effort of coding skyline Cholesky. The book also contains the description and source code of simple sparse matrix routines, still useful even if long superseded. is about same as for Cholesky for banded matrices (available for banded matrices, e.g. in LAPACK; for a prototype skyline code, see ). Before storing a matrix in skyline format, the rows and columns are typically renumbered to reduce the size of the skyline (the number of nonzero entries stored) and to decrease the number of operations in the skyline Cholesky algorithm. The same heuristic renumbering algorithm that reduce the bandwidth are also used to reduce the skyline. The basic and one of the earliest algorithms to do that is reverse Cuthill‚ÄìMcKee algorithm. However, skyline storage is not as popular for very large systems (many millions of equations) because skyline Cholesky is not so easily adapted for massively parallel computing, and general sparse methods, which store only the nonzero entries of the matrix, become more efficient for very large problems due to much less fill-in.

In 2018, Dysart became involved in the early stages of Comics For Peace, a Pakistani initiative by locals to encourage and promote positive social change through the medium of comic books. He helped hand choose and then mentor young creatives from across Pakistan. The students created stories that brought attention to the societal issues that concerned them, including discrimination, hate, violence and extremism. Two creators published by the program and mentored by Dysart were brought to the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, where they were given a table and spent the convention pitching their comics to attendees. In the process, thousands of free comics created by Pakistani young people were handed out.

The film, starring Amanda Bynes, Sara Paxton and Matt Long, was released theatrically on September 21, 2007 by Universal Pictures. Plot Sydney White (Amanda Bynes) is a simple, boyish, easy-going, and the daughter of a plumber, Paul White (John Schneider). Her mother, a Kappa Sorority member, died when Sydney was still young. She sets off to attend college at SAU and pledge to her mother's once dignified sorority. There she meets Demetria Rosemead Hotchkiss (Crystal Hunt), known as Dinky, also an incoming member of the Kappa Sorority, and the two quickly become friends. While on their way to their dorm, she meets Tyler Prince (Matt Long), the president of a popular fraternity, who is also the on-off boyfriend of the extremely tyrannical, manipulative, and most hated president of the student council and the head of the Kappa Sorority, Rachel Witchburn (Sara Paxton). Rachel checks out her university's website that ranks the \\"hottest\\" in the school several times a day, and is always number one on the list. Tyler meets Sydney and is immediately smitten, while Rachel watches from her window, with an immediate dislike towards Sydney. When she first meets Sydney she believes that she's not \\"Kappa material\\" and doesn't care that she's a legacy. Since Sydney and Dinky's mothers were Kappas, they survived the rush and were accepted as legacies. However, they need to survive the pledging. Sydney's tomboyish upbringing proves to be an asset as she stands out among the other girls and manages to overcome the difficult initiation tasks. She also unintentionally inspires the other girls to innocently defy shallow things that Rachel teaches them. This unique personality gradually propels Sydney's popularity as seen on the university website. Rachel gets extremely jealous of her because of this. As one of the Kappa Sorority's traditional rituals, the freshmen need to find a date late at midnight. Sydney finds Lenny (Jack Carpenter), one of the seven dorks who live in a run-down house known as the Vortex. Sydney is then picked by Rachel to ditch her date, which ended in Lenny paying. Sydney fails to become a member of Kappa when Rachel humiliates her in the pledge gala and lies that she has disobeyed the rules: lying about her background and cheating on a Kappa quiz. Sydney leaves that night in the rain, unintentionally sitting in front of the Vortex. She is welcomed by the seven dorks: Lenny, the one with high maintenance health; Terrence (Jeremy Howard), a genius and post- grad, despite the fact that he still attends classes; Jeremy (Adam Hendershott), who is very shy and uses a dog puppet to communicate, Gurkin (Danny Strong), a hot-tempered blogger; Spanky (Samm Levine), who has no experience with girls; George (Arnie Pantoja), the childlike freshman who still believes in Santa Claus and doesn't know how to tie a knot; and Embelakbo Akapaktumbe‚Äì also known as \\"Embele\\"‚Äì (Dont√© Bonner), a Nigerian interchange student who is highly intelligent but has Jet lag. The Vortex is coincidentally the target of Rachel's plan to open a luxury centre that will benefit only the top Greek sororities and fraternities. She plans to subject it to a planned demolition, which is something Tyler is opposed to after he gets to know Sydney and her housemates better. Sydney, together with the seven dorks, tries to bring Rachel down from her student council position by running Terrence for president. He is soon disqualified because he had already graduated six years prior, as revealed when Rachel humiliated the group at a party. Sydney replaces him as a presidential candidate and starts her campaign. Unlike Rachel's views that promote elitism and exclusivism based solely on popularity and appearances, something that everyone on campus dislikes about her, Sydney and the dorks believe in accepting diversity and equality. This earns Sydney respect from different cliques, and she gets the number one rank on the school's \\"hottest\\" website, which infuriates Rachel more than ever. The day before the debate and election, Rachel hires a hacker to destroy Sydney's files using a virus called 'The Poison Apple.' Sydney is then forced to stay up all night in the library doing her work on Gurkin's laptop. When Sydney finishes her work, she accidentally falls asleep and is almost disqualified for not showing up, but Tyler wakes her with a kiss just in time. After Rachel answers the question posed by Professor Carlton (Brian Patrick Clarke), Sydney's supporters arrive, led by a goth girl (Kierstin Koppel) whose group is devoted to Gurkin's blog and becomes his girlfriend. Sydney's speech defends the underrated people, including dorks, and concludes by stating that she herself is a dork. This incites a number of students to also admit dork status including Tyler, Jeremy, Spanky and Dinky. Sydney wins the debate and the election, becoming the new president, while Rachel is stripped of her Kappa sisterhood privileges by her sisters because of the years of cruelty she bestowed on both her Kappa sisters and the students at the University as well as lying and cheating during the election. The film ends with Sydney's father and other construction workers fixing the Vortex. New relationships have formed as well‚ÄîDinky and Lenny are now a couple (who bonded because of their sensitive digestive system), Spanky is finally getting some girls, the Goth girl and Gurkin are dating, and Sydney and Tyler are together. George has learned how to tie a knot, Jeremy is finally coming out of his shell, and Terrence has become a millionaire because of his theory (He sold his theory {the predictive analytic probability theory that he finally perfected and can predict anything from the behavior of amino acids in a stable isotope peptide bond to the outcome of sporting events} to ibet.com for $10 million). And, according to Sydney's narration, they all lived \\"dorkily ever after\\".

When those three players were all selected with the three immediately preceding picks (by the Dallas Cowboys, Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots, respectively), the Pittsburgh draft managers were unprepared and were forced to make a selection before their fifteen-minute time limit expired, and they settled on Richardson.

Part of the problem was that the Steelers played a 3-4 defense, and Richardson didn't have the build to play defensive end in that scheme. The Steelers made him an inside linebacker, and he didn't make the adjustment very well. Following the 1991 season, long-time head coach Chuck Noll retired and was replaced by Bill Cowher, who tried to switch Richardson to outside linebacker (his position for the first three years of his collegiate career). When that didn't work, Cowher asked player development director Tom Donahoe if it was too soon to cut him. When Donahoe said he should keep the top forty- seven players regardless of their draft history, Richardson was traded to the Washington Redskins for a seventh-round draft pick; if a trade had not been possible, Richardson would have simply been waived. After four uneventful games with the Redskins, he was released and signed with the New York Jets. At the end of the season, after seven games with the Jets, Richardson's short NFL career was over.  Life after football  Richardson returned to college and earned his master's degree in business administration from Emory University in Atlanta in 2000, and currently works as a financial analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York City. He was in the World Trade Center for a meeting on the morning of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. His meeting was scheduled to take place on an upper floor of the building, but he was delayed in the lobby before boarding the elevator, and was able to leave the World Trade Center safely after the first plane hit the building.

The name Movilla is an Anglicized form of the Irish magh bile, which means ‚Äúthe plain of the ancient tree,‚Äù so called because on the site where the abbey was built, pagans had previously worshipped a sacred tree. Finnian's association with Movilla was memorialized in the Book of Armagh as ‚Äúvir vitae venerabilis qui jacet in miraculis multis in sua civitate Maghbile‚Äù (A man of venerable life who reposes in many miracles in his city of Movilla). At the time of Finnian's death in 579, Movilla was recognised as a great monastic foundation. History Finnian's legacy ensured that Movilla Abbey flourished. By the seventh century, it had become one of the greatest monasteries in Ireland - a thriving centre of Celtic Christianity, a community of worship, prayer, study, mission and trade. The Abbey's reputation was enhanced by virtue of the fact it had a complete copy of the Bible (the Latin Vulgate Bible), which Finnian had obtained from Rome. At the time, it was the only complete copy of the Bible in the whole of Ireland, and served to enhance Movilla's reputation nationally, as a unique centre of learning. Movilla's most famous student was St. Columba, a pupil of Finnian's. Columba became a deacon while at Movilla and is said to have performed his first miracles there, turning water into wine for the Eucharist. After completing his training, Columba eventually went on his own way, but returned to Movilla to visit his old teacher in the 550's. This was to be a significant visit, as it led to what is thought to be the world's first recorded wrangle over copyright. During his stay at Movilla, Columba asked Finnian if he could spend some time examining the Abbey's precious copy of the Scriptures. Columba was keen to have a copy of his own, but he knew that Finnian would not permit him to copy it, so he began to transcribe it secretly without his permission. He had almost completed his task when Finnian found out what he was doing. Finnian insisted that Columba surrender the 'pirate' copy, but Columba refused. In order to seek redress, Finnian took the case to Diarmait mac Cerbaill, the High King of Ireland. He pronounced his famous verdict: 'To every cow belongs her calf, to every book its copy. The copy belongs to Finnian.' Columba returned his copy in bad grace, and because he disagreed with King Diarmaid's ruling against him, he reportedly instigated a successful rebellion of the U√≠ N√©ill clan against the King. The battle, called the Battle of the Book, was claimed to have caused around 3,000 casualties. In addition to being a Christian centre of prayer, learning and mission, Movilla was known for its flourishing work in crafts, particularly bronze and glass. In 1980-81, R.J. Ivens and M.J. Yates excavated the area near the Movilla Road before it was realigned. They said: 'Without doubt the most important finds from the early monastery were those illustrating the skills of the craftsmen, who worked in iron, bronze and glass. There was much industrial debris - lumps of slag, broken pieces of crucible and fragments of scrap metal, all informative but perhaps not very exciting. But a few objects do stimulate the imagination. For example, a trial-piece, on which the bronzesmith rehearsed his designs of triangles, scrolls and arcs, and a glass-headed pin, decorated with discs and trails of different coloured glass. The technical and artistic sophistication of such objects is certainly at variance with the impression of material poverty given by the simple timber houses and rather crude pottery...The excavation of a very small part of what was once an extensive monastic settlement has thus given...an insight into the skills of the early Christian craftsmen.'Newtown: A History of Newtownards by Trevor McCavery, pp27-28, White Row Publications 2013 In the seventh century, Pope Honorius I sent an epistle to a number of Celtic churchmen, encouraging conformity to the Roman dating of Easter and cautioning against the Pelagian heresy. It is believed that one of the recipients was St. Cronan of Movilla, whom Bede, in his list of recipients, specified as Cromanus. In the early eighth century, the bishop at Movilla was Colman, son of Murchu, who wrote a hymn to St. Michael the Archangel. It begins: > In Trinitate spes mea fixa non in omine Et archangelum deprecor Michaelem > nomine In the Trinity my hope is fixed not in an omen, And the archangel I > beseech, Michael by name. Movilla began to decline after it was sacked by the Danes in 823, and was united with Bangor Abbey in the tenth century. It was somewhat revitalized in 1135 when St. Malachy of Armagh established a group of Augustinians in the abbey, but it never recovered its former glory. In 1306 the monastery at Movilla had one of the lowest valuations of church property in the area, at two and a half marks. Movilla was so poor that the ruling Anglo-Normans had no interest in taking it over and left Irishmen as abbots.Newtown: A History of Newtownards by Trevor McCavery, p30, White Row Publications 2013 The abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1542. During the reign of Elizabeth I, Brian O‚ÄôNeill, chief of the O'Neills of Clandeboye, burned Movilla, along with other abbeys in the Ards in his campaign to prevent the English from using Irish abbeys for their military garrisons. Abbey Ruins and Movilla Cemetery Nothing visible remains today of Finnian's Celtic Abbey. What ruins still standing are those of the (15th Century) Augustinian church, which comprises two gables, placed about 150 feet apart. Inside, the church measures 107 feet by 21 feet. In the east wall, there once was a three-light window, two of which have largely been blocked up. The third window remaining is Romanesque in style. At the top of the arch are two small carved heads. In the west wall are two lights with trefoil heads and transoms showing signs of tracery. The existing ruins can only be accessed through the entrance to Movilla Cemetery, on Old Movilla Road. On the north wall of the Augustinian abbey ruin are several tapered sandstone grave slabs with large crosses carved in relief in various designs. Those for men depict swords, while those for women depict a shear (sickle) and withe (willow). Anglo-Norman in origin, the slabs date from the tenth to the thirteenth century. One of them bears the inscription ‚ÄúOr Do Dertrend,‚Äù which translates as ‚Äúa prayer for Dertriu,‚Äù who, presumably, was a tenth-century abbot of Movilla. There are also numerous memorials from the early seventeenth century, two of which are especially notable: the tomb of the Corry Family, which is designed as a small Doric temple; and the Parr Mausoleum, built in 1860 in the Gothic Revival style. The surrounding Movilla Cemetery (managed by Ards and North Down Borough Council), is still in use and is the site of twenty-one Commonwealth burials from World War I and twenty- four from World War II, seven of which remain unidentified. Some of the more recent burials include that of Colonel Robert Blair Paddy Mayne, one of the most highly decorated British soldiers in World War II; and that of Ottilie Patterson (Barber), the jazz and blues singer most noted for her performances with the Chris Barber Band in the 1950s and '60s. The Abbey Stone In 1886, W. J. Patterson offered this information to the Annual Report of the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club: > Some years ago, a curious stone object was dug up in the burial ground which > surrounds the ruins of the old Abbey Church of Movilla near Newtownards, Co. > Down. It was found under the following circumstances: A gentleman living in > the neighbourhood, wishing to construct a family burial vault, had an > excavation made to the depth of eight or ten feet, until the solid slate > rock which underlies the clay of the cemetery was reached. At the bottom of > the excavation, resting on the rock, was found [a] large stone coffer. . . > .The measurements are as follows:--Length, 3 feet 8 inches; width, 2 feet 8 > inches; height, 1 foot 10 inches. Inside measurements‚Äî26 inches long, 14 > inches wide, and about 15 inches deep. Its general appearance is that of a > clumsily made oblong trough on which the only attempt at ornamentation > consists of some shallow panels worked on the outside. Within the upper > edge, there is a ledge sunk about an inch, which may have been for the > purpose of receiving a stone lid. Many who examined the stone believed it to be an early baptismal font ‚Äúhastily buried for security on the approach of some party of Danish pirates.‚Äù Others have speculated the object was a chest, or coffer, for the safe keeping of church valuables, which would accord with the fittings for a stone lid and comport with the Viking theory. Another theory is that the object was the base of a sculptured cross and that the hollow part was the mortice in which the end of the cross had stood. Patterson, however, rejected that idea on the grounds that the size of the block would have been totally disproportionate to the large socket; in fact, for a cross to have stood in the object's base, it would have required a shaft, or stem, 26 inches wide by 14 inches thick and ‚Äúwould have been of such a weight as to have burst out so frail a base, if the cross got the slightest lean to either side.‚Äù Preservation Movilla Abbey, church of Augustinian Canons, is a State Care Historic Monument in the townland of Movilla, in Borough of Ards, at grid ref: J5035 7440.

Newspaper career Born in Chicago, Illinois, Holtzman wrote for his hometown papers for over 50 years. Beginning as a copyboy at the Chicago Daily News in 1943, Holtzman wrote for the paper through its merger with the Chicago Sun. His influence and viewpoints made him something of a legend among newspapermen. Southern humorist Lewis Grizzard, who was sports editor of the Sun-Times for part of Holtzman's career, called him \\"the dean of American baseball writers,\\" and went on to say \\"He never smiled, but he had the keys to Cooperstown. No major leaguer ever got into the Hall of Fame if Holtzman didn't want him there. He had tremendous sources. He was writing about the possibility of a baseball players union and a baseball players strike long before anyone else.\\"If I Ever Get Back To Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My Feet To The Ground. Lewis Grizzard. p. 319. Holtzman left the Sun-Times in 1981 for the Chicago Tribune, remaining there until his retirement in 1999. Holtzman was awarded the 1991 J. G. Taylor Spink Award by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). He was honored by the Associated Press Sports Editors in 1997, who awarded him the Red Smith Award, which is America's most prestigious sports writing honor. He was elected to the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 2004 and the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. Among Holtzman's contributions to the game during his career was the creation of the save statistic in 1959. It was adopted as an official statistic for the 1969 season, the first official new statistic since the run batted in (RBI) in 1920. On July 15, 2008, Holtzman suffered a stroke in Evanston, Illinois, and died on July 19. Official historian In 1999, Holtzman retired as a newspaper writer and was named the official historian of Major League Baseball. He wrote occasional columns on the MLB.com website. In 2001, Holtzman decided to revert to counting walks in as hits, reviving an old debate; 1887 was the only season in which walks were counted as hits, an experiment which proved unpopular, but Holtzman took the point of view that once something is counted as a hit it must always remain so. Revised statistics appeared in the seventh edition of Total Baseball, then the official encyclopedia of Major League Baseball. The move has been criticized (and largely ignored) by most other baseball historians. Books Holtzman wrote or edited more than a dozen books, including No Cheering in the Press Box, a collection of interviews with 18 sportswriters that was published in 1974. A revised edition in 1995 added interviews with six new subjects. Among his other notable books are The Commissioners, which contained biographies of baseball's commissioners and a history of the office, and Baseball Chicago Style, a history of the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox.

Description The Aeolian Sky was completed in 1978 at the Japanese Hashihama Shipyard. She was 148 metres long, measured over 14,000 tonnes, and was valued at ¬£3 million. Registered in the Greek port of Piraeus, she was run by Proteus Maritime SA, and was a conventional modern ship with crew quarters in the superstructure and her own large derricks for unloading cargo. Sinking In late 1979 the Aeolian Sky sailed from Hull, via Rotterdam, to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, Africa. On 3 November 1979 while travelling 20 miles off the coast of Guernsey in the Channel Islands she collided with the German coaster Anna Knueppell in fog, during a storm at 4.30 a.m. A French tug based at Cherbourg, the Abeille Languedoc, went to the scene and managed to get a line aboard. Plans were initially laid to tow her back to the French port; only lightly damaged, the Anna Knuepell stood by to render assistance if needed. At 9.30 in the morning a Royal Navy helicopter arrived and evacuated most of the crew; it then had to withdraw to its base at Lee-on-Solent with engine problems, leaving a handful of crew aboard the now sinking vessel. By this time the ship had drifted some distance and was sinking at the bows, so the initial plan was abandoned and the tug headed for The Solent. However, the port authorities of Portsmouth and Southampton, concerned that the ship would sink fouling their busy waterways, declined permission for her to enter either port. With the weather at gale force, the tug started to tow the Aeolian Sky into the storm to try to make the shelter of Portland Harbour. However at 3.45 a.m. on 4 November 1979 she took on too much water and sank 5 miles south of St Aldhelm's Head, still 12 miles from the safety of Portland. She settled on her port side in 30 metres of water with her bows facing south. The wreck Since her sinking the wreck has become a popular dive site as she is accessible from Swanage, Weymouth and Isle of Portland based diving trips. At the time of sinking she lay 9 metres below the surface but salvage work, and explosives used to reduce the risk of her becoming a hazard to navigation, have lowered this to 18 metres. Her bows were blown off during this activity and lie separate from the main body of the wreck. The wreck is at . Diver Magazine has produced a tour of the wreck. Cargo She lies surrounded by parts of Land Rovers and pipes that were among her cargo: she was also carrying two 0-6-0 diesel electric locomotives manufactured by Brush Traction for the Tanzania Railways Corporation, and a load of chemicals, some hazardous. Also among her cargo were a million pounds in Seychelles Rupees, most of which have yet to be recovered (although a few have made their way to auction).

Playing career Jerry played on the field with his brother Avraham. In 1939, during a tour of Australia, Avraham decided to stay in the country and it was the last time that Jerry would see his brother who ended up dying in battle against Japanese forces in New Guinea. Managerial career=Maccabi Tel Aviv and Israel After the retirement of Egon Pollack, Beit haLevi took over the reins of the club that made him famous as a player. He built a strong side that was arguably the strongest side in the country. Star players Eli Fuchs, Itzhak Schneor and Shiye Glazer and tough tactics helped Beit haLevi capture two league championships in 1951 and 1952 as well as a double in 1954. He left Maccabi for a brief stint at city rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv before bringing Maccabi another league title in 1956. During his time with Maccabi, Beit haLevi served two terms as manager of the Israel national football team. His bunker tactics led to the national team's style of play being referred to as \\"Jerry's bunker\\". After the 1956 season with Maccabi, Beit haLevi was fired, though he returned in the 1960s and is credited with the development of such national team stars such as Giora Spiegel. After retiring from coaching, he served as the chairman for the club. Nigerian national team In 1960, Jerry received an offer to coach the Nigerian national football team, which he accepted. In his first match against Ghana, Nigeria lost 3‚Äì0 in Lagos. The press called for Beit haLevi to be fired, but members of the Nigeria Football Association (NFA) pushed back against the exceedingly harsh criticism from the press, and Jerry remained in his position. In November, Jerry recorded his first achievement as Nigeria beat Egypt 2:1. In April 1961, the Israeli coach led the national team to two draws against Ghana. The positive relationship with sportswriters translated into positive coverage of Jerry in most of the Nigerian press from this time onward. At the end of 1961, Nigeria played against Tunisia as qualifiers for the 1962 Africa Cup game. The first of the two games took place in Lagos on 25 November, ending in a 2-1 victory for the Green Eagles. Sportswriter Bonar Ekanem from the West African Pilot attributed this win to Jerry: \\"Beth Halevi has done his job. For the first time since his arrival in this country as a coach, I hand him a bouquet of roses\\" (27 November 1961). He went even further in this praise a few days later: \\"Hail, Beit Halevi!...where we hitherto had wild and ‚Äòbushman‚Äô soccer, we have now thoroughbred and civilized exchanges with economic of energy and goal certainty\\" (29 November 1961).Schler and Dubinsky 2020, p.16 The second game was held in Tunisia on 10 December. Beit Halevi was not permitted by the Tunisians to come to the game due to the hostile relations between Israel and Tunisia. All in all, Jerry led Nigeria to four wins, five draws, and three losses. During this time he was also heavily involved in trying to exhume the body of his brother for burial in Israel, but was unsuccessful.

One route provides Texas Eagle connecting service to Nacogdoches, Houston and Galveston, Texas; the other route provides connecting nonstop service between Longview and Shreveport, Louisiana. Opened in 1940, the red brick depot replaced an 1874 structure. Its Colonial Revival style, popular in the early 20th century, includes stylized quoins, brick cornice and grey stone trim used to highlight the coping, keystones and lintels. In early 2013, the city broke ground on a $2.2 million project to transform the depot into a multimodal transportation center. During the renovation, workers installed new dormers and the open-air waiting room was recreated. The project was largely funded through a Transportation Enhancement grant from the Federal Highway Administration, matched by city funds.

The station was originally built in 1906 by the Texas & Pacific Railway and also used by the Missouri Pacific Railroad. History Mineola station in October 1996, shortly after reopening The Missouri-Pacific Railroad built the station in 1906. In 1951, as \\"modernization\\", the hipped roof was removed and decoration stripped from the station, leaving a rectangular brick building. The Missouri-Pacific Railroad ended service on its Texas Eagle on April 30, 1971, one day before Amtrak took over passenger services. In March 1974, Amtrak's Inter-American was extended from Fort Worth to St. Louis, restoring passenger service to the Missouri-Pacific Railroad's main line but without a stop in Mineola. The Inter-American was replaced by the Eagle in 1981, which in turn was renamed as the Texas Eagle in 1988. On April 14, 1996, Newport station in Arkansas was closed as part of a deal with the Union Pacific Railroad to reopen the stop at Mineola. Trains began stopping at Mineola on April 28. According to Mineola native Willie Brown, the station was reopened as the result of his persistent lobbying of President Bill Clinton. Responding to an Amtrak report that a survey did not reveal anyone wanting to get off in Mineola, Brown reportedly told Clinton: \\"The reason to stop in Mineola is not to let anybody off. It's to let the people on. It's not that great a place. Look at me! I left!\\" Amtrak, however, credited \\"Mineola community leaders\\" with the successful effort. In 2005, the city began an $800,000 renovation project, funded primarily by the Texas Department of Transportation, to restore the station to its original appearance. A new angled roof was constructed, signage and landscaping built, and the interior converted for use as a railway museum. The station was rededicated on June 10, 2006.

History According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated 1,626 dunams of land from the Palestinian village of Mas-ha in 1977 in order to construct Elkana.Mas-ha Village Profile, ARIJ, 2013, p. 17 Elkana was established as one of the earliest settlements after 64 Knesset members signed a bill to allow the use of state land in the area for construction. On 1 May 1977, fifteen men climbed the hill and started preparing the area for families for the official day on 10 May. Amongst the first families to move to the settlement was that of the former Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz ten days later. Elkana became the fourth community to be established by the Seventeenth government of Israel headed by Yitzhak Rabin, following the Kadum outpost, Ofra, and Ma'ale Adumim. A few months later, forty families had moved into prefabricated home's called 'ashkubiot' and after two years, over a hundred families lived in the village. In 1983, the first permanent structures were built as the village was divided into different neighbourhoods named after the number of homes planned in each one: 220, 165, 80, and 34 (also called Bnai Elkana). More recently, two newer neighbourhoods have been built; One on the northern side of the town as well as another smaller one to the west. In November 2013 Israel published plans for 283 new homes to be built in Elkana. In January 2014 they received permission for the homes, and on 5 September 2014 announced tenders for the units.New Samaria Homes Announced Amid 'Covert Freeze' - Retrieved 5 September 2014 The town was named after the nearby Nahal Qana and Elkanah, father of Samuel (1 Samuel 1:1), who is believed to have lived in the area. Virtually all of the town's residents are religious of a primarily national religious orientation. The Trans-Samarian Highway previously cut through the town until 2000 when the road, which now skirts to the south, was upgraded.

First in the late 1970s until 1984, holding the now inactive Junior Heavyweight Championship under his real name. From 1987 until 1989 he worked as Conquistador Dos, working as part of a masked team known as Los Conquistadores. He has also worked extensively in his native Puerto Rico, primarily for the World Wrestling Council (WWC) where he played the masked \\"Super Medico I\\", where he teamed both with a masked Don Kent in 1984 and his son Jos√© Estrada Jr. in 1990. He worked with the WWC in 2007 as a wrestling manager. His son is also a retired professional wrestler, who worked primarily in Puerto Rico. Professional wrestling career Estrada made his professional wrestling debut in 1975 in his native Puerto Rico working for the local World Wrestling Council (WWC) promotion. In WWC he was given the masked ring character Super M√©dico I (\\"Super Medic 1\\"), teaming with Super M√©dico II to form Los Super M√©dicos, sometimes also referred to simply as Los M√©dicos, often wrestling clad in all white. On December 25, 1976 the team defeated Hercules Ayala and Victor Jovica to win the WWC North American Tag Team Championship. Los Super M√©dicos held the titles until March 4, 1977 where they were defeated by the team of Danny and Michel Martel. By 1978 Estrada found himself working for the New York-based World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) Carlos Jos√© Estrada, sometimes billed simply as Carlos Estrada or Jos√© Estrada. On January 20, 1978 Estrada defeated Tony Garea in a tournament final to win the WWWF Junior Heavyweight Championship, a championship that had been inactive for at least six years prior to the tournament. Three days later Estrada dropped the championship to Tatsumi Fujinami who would then bring the championship with him to Japan. In 1981 he returned to Puerto Rico as Super M√©dico I, teaming with Super M√©dico II to win the North American Tag Team Championship from Los Pastores (\\"The Sheepherders\\"; Luke Williams and Butch Miller) in April, only to lose them back to Los Pastores in May after a brief, but bloody storyline feud between the two teams. He would continue to work for the WWWF, now simply the WWF after his brief return to Puerto Rico and also worked for the Japanese New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) promotion through the WWF's tours of Japan. World Wrestling Council (1983-1986) In 1983 he returned to Puerto Rico once more and with his Super M√©dicos partner won the WWC North American Tag Team Championship for the third time on July 10, 1983 when they defeated King Tonga and El Gran Apolo, holding the titles for three months before Tonga and Apolo regained the belts. He would work for the WWF again in 1984 before returning full-time to Puerto Rico. Back in Puerto Rico Los Super M√©dicos moved up in the tag team ranks as they won their first ever WWC World Tag Team Championship on September 10, 1983 defeating the team of Carlos Col√≥n and Pedro Morales. Between December, 1983 and January, 1984, the \\"Super Medicos\\" had a feud for the World Tag Team titles against Hercules Ayala and King Tonga, which began on a televised match in late December 1983 when Ayala and Tonga unmasked one of the \\"Super Medicos\\" (probably #2). The feud continued on January 6, 1984, on another match during which Ayala and Tonga unmasked Super Medico #2 (his manager, Barrabas, covered his face with his jacket). On January 13, 1984, the two teams had a match in Ponce in which Ayala and Tonga managed to unmask both Super Medics (they left the ring areas with towels around their faces so the fans never saw their faces). Finally on January 20, the team of Hercules Ayala and King Tonga defeated Los Super M√©dicos for the titles in a cage match in Ponce, only to drop them to Los Super M√©dicos 22 days later. Their second run as the WWC World Tag Team Champions came to an end on April 25, 1984 at the hands of The Invaders (Invader I and Invader III) In August Los Super M√©dicos won the World tag team championship again, but in October the team was stripped of the titles as Super M√©dico II was unmasked and was played by Don Kent, not the man that actually won the title with Estrada. Following the revelation that Kent had replaced Johnny Rodz and Kent left the area, leaving Estrada as Super M√©dico I on his own. Super M√©dico I and Black Gordman won the WWC World Tag Team Championship briefly in December 1984. After the brief tag team run Estrada, still as Super M√©dico I turned face and won the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship on February 10, 1985, beating former partner Black Gordman. His first reign ended on June 8, 1985 when he lost it to Fidel Sierra, but regained it a month later. Eric Embry ended Estrada's second run, swapping the title back and forth in May of the following year as well. Los Conquistadors (1987-1989) In 1987 Jos√© Estrada Jr. returned to the World Wrestling Federation, he adopted a new masked persona, known as Conquistador Dos, teaming with Jos√© Luis Rivera as Conquistador Uno, to form a team known as Los Conquistadores, which despite both wrestlers being Puerto Rican were billed as from \\"Somewhere in Latin America\\". The team was used mainly as enhancement talent, with their primary function to make other tag teams, especially face teams. Los Conquistadors participated in the 1988 Survivor Series. At the Survivor Series they were part of a \\"5 teams vs. 5 teams\\" special elimination match, teaming with Demolition (Ax and Smash), The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov), The Fabulous Rougeaus (Raymond and Jacques Rougeau). The five tag teams took on the collective face team of The Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian), The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid), The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) and The Young Stallions (Jim Powers and Paul Roma). The match came down to Los Conquistadors and the Powers of Pain as the last team on each side, with The Powers of Pain winning after Demolition's manager Mr. Fuji switched sides and helped the Powers of Pain win the match. This match would make the only time Los Conquistadors would wrestle on a WWF pay per view (PPV) show. By 1989 Estrada worked in singles matches, both as \\"Conquistador Dos\\" and under his real name. Return to Puerto Rico (1989-1991) Estrada returned to Puerto Rico once his WWF stint ended in the spring of 1989, once again working as Super M√©dico I. On May 28, 1989 he defeated Jonathan Holiday to win the WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship for the first time. He would later lost the title to, and regain it from Chicky Star before losing it for good to Eddie Watts. As part of the feud with Chicky Starr, Starr managed to unmask Super Medico, who had to get under the ring to avoid the fans seeing his face. The following week, however, Starr tried the same trick again and actually took of Super Medico's mask, but this time Super Medico had painted his face white and caught Starr by surprise and pinned him, regaining the title (WWC TV show). In 1990 Estrada teamed up with a new Super M√©dico III, with his son Jos√© Estrada Jr. wearing the mask. The two defeated Los Mercenarios (Cuban Assassin and Jerry Morrow) March 31, 1990 to win the WWC World Tag Team Championship, Senior's fifth and Junior's first title reign. They lost the titles to Lance Idol and Rick Valentine but quickly regained them. In September the titles were held up after a brutal match against another masked tag team known as the Texas Hangmen (Killer and Psycho), but Los Super M√©dico won them back after another brutal match between the two teams on September 22, 1990 only to lose them to the Texas Hangmen a week later. On November 10 that same year Los Super M√©dicos defeated Eric Embry and Rick Valentine to win the WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championship for the first time. In December they lost the titles back to Embry and Valentine, but regained them in January. The reign ended only days later when Valentine and Gran Mendoza defeated them for the championship. Retirement Estrada would retire by 1992, working as a trainer in Puerto Rico and making special appearances at times. He worked with WWC in 2007 as a wrestling manager.

The title comes from the Breton word for \\"nightingale\\" (eostig), a symbolic figure in the poem.Marie de France, \\"Les Lais de Marie de France\\", p. 211, traduits et annot√©s par Harf-Lancner, L., Livre de Poche 1990. It is the eighth poem in the collection known as the Lais of Marie de France, and the poem is only found in the manuscript known as Harley 978 (also called manuscript H). Like the other poems in the collection, La√ºstic is written in the Anglo-Norman dialect of Old French, in couplets eight syllables long. Plot summary Two knights live in adjoining houses, in the vicinity of Saint-Malo in Brittany; one is married and one lives as a bachelor. The wife of the married knight enters into a secret relationship with the other knight, but their contact is limited to conversation and the exchange of small gifts, since a \\"high wall made of dark stone\\"\\"La√ºstic\\" 55. separates the two households. Typically, the lady rises at night, once her husband is asleep, and goes to the window to converse with her lover; whenever her lover is home, she is kept under close watch. Her suspicious husband demands to know why she spends her nights at the window, and she says she does so to listen to the nightingale sing. He mocks her, and orders his servants to capture the nightingale. When it is caught he brings it to the lady's chambers, denying her requests to release the bird. Instead, he breaks its neck and throws it at her, \\"bloodying the front of her tunic just a bit above her breasts\\".\\"La√ºstic\\" 56. After he leaves, the lady mourns the bird's death and the suffering she must accept, knowing she can no longer be at the window at night. She wraps the nightingale's body in silk, and embroidered with writing in gold thread, and charges her servant to deliver the bird and her message to her lover, who, in response, preserves the nightingale in a reliquary, a small vessel which he has encased with small jewels and precious stones, and carries it with him always. Analysis and significance The reference to a nightingale alludes to the tale of Philomela in Ovid's Metamorphoses on several levels. Philomela embroiders her story in a tapestry much like the lady of Laustic; Philomela herself is transformed into a nightingale at the end of Ovid's story; and as Michelle Freeman suggests, the broken body of the nightingale, which signifies the end of the lovers' communication, is symbolic of the cutting out of Philomela's tongue, which effectively silences her. The servants hide traps for the nightingale in hazel trees, a plant that is also found in Chevrefoil and Le Fresne, two of Marie's other Lais. In 1950, William S. Woods commented that Marie's lays display \\"her feminine attitude and style in a great number of places\\", which he called \\"one of the most endearing\\" qualities of her writing, and says that she has \\"a true womanly love for forceful and superlative adverbs and expressions\\". In \\"La√ºstic\\", he argues, \\"the climax of the vengeance is not the killing of the bird, but rather the fact that its dead body bloodied the waist of the woman-- the body and blood of the bird which had been an excuse for communication between the two lovers\\". This is one of many examples of \\"feminine subtlety\\" Woods finds in the lays; Marie \\"reveals herself as a woman who appreciated and could use the ultimate in ruthless and cold-hearted poetic justice, and as possessing a cruel subtlety which few, if any, men could equal\\". In 1984, Michelle Freeman discussed the lai in a study that sought to investigate the position of a female author in a tradition of translating to and from Latin and the vernacular languages. She argues that the nightingale serves as a metaphor which constitutes a means for the lovers to communicate one last time; initially a metaphor, the nightingale becomes a narrative commentary of the events which have transpired. Marie as the artist serves to preserve the story of the two lovers through the act of writing, just as the servant is entrusted with the lady's message and enwrapped nightingale. Robert Cargo, in an article from 1966, focused on those messages, noting that there are two: first is the message conveyed by the servant, second is the embroidered message on the silk cloth; Marie is vague about the contents of both. Cargo concludes that the servant's message must be a simple one, \\"This is for you, from my lady\\", whereas the embroidered one, analogous to the message in the Philomena story, is likely \\"an embroidered scene depicting the story, [which] serves to communicate her undying love to the knight\\".

It was released in America in March 2008, and is titled Attack of the Fiend, as the fourth book in the Spook's series. Plot Tom's mother has returned to her own land, Greece. In a special room in the family farmhouse, she has left behind three trunks only to be opened by her youngest son Tom. The Spook sends Tom and Alice to retrieve the trunks, but they arrive to find the farm ransacked, the trunks gone and Tom's brother Jack, his pregnant wife Ellie, and their young daughter Mary all missing, kidnapped and taken to Pendle, a witch controlled area. While Alice goes ahead to Pendle to see if she can learn anything about the missing family, Tom leaves word for his next-oldest brother, James, then goes back to Chipenden where the Spook has just been visited by a Pendle priest, Father Stocks, who tells the Spook that the witches are allying to summon the Fiend (Devil) himself. After arriving in Pendle, Tom sees a young blonde girl named Mab, who tells him that Alice has been put under a spell of binding by the Mouldheels, and she needs his help. Mab leads Tom to a clearing where her two twin sisters, Beth and Jennet, before realizing they're all witches. Tom escapes thanks to the mark of Alice on his arm, and follows the girls as they flee. Tracking them to a small village, Tom rescues Alice from a cottage, noticing the seer Tibb, a small bald creature with sharp teeth and a hairy back and limbs, and all are watching Tom and Alice. Alice tells Tom that she is bound to the place by a spell cast by Mab; to be freed, Tom has to burn a lock of Alice's hair that Mab has taken. Alice tells Tom that his family is locked up in Malkin Tower, a nearly-impenetrable fortress. Tom and Father Stocks go to the local magistrate, Roger Nowell, and are met by the housekeeper Mistress Wurmalde, whom Tom recognises as a witch. Tom swears out a complaint of kidnapping. Magistrate Nowell sets out for Malkin Tower with Tom and Father Stocks, taking along a constable and two bailiffs. When the witches won't admit them, the magistrate tells Tom and Father Stocks to go back to his house, where they will be his guests for the night while he rides to the nearest army garrison for help. Father Stocks eats the food Mistress Wurmalde serves them, but Tom refuses it ‚Äì and thus avoids being drugged into a stupor. During the night, Mistress Wurmalde leaves Read Hall in a carriage and later returns, hiding the seer Tibb beneath her voluminous skirts. Mistress Wurmalde reveals herself to be an old enemy of Tom's mother from Greece, and tells him that his brother is being tortured by Grimalkin and it is his fault for continuing his mother's work against the Dark. She promises to release Tom's family if Tom gives her the key to his mother's trunks that he wears around his neck. She gives him one day to decide. Back in his guest room, Tom hears Father Stocks begging for mercy but finds himself unable to rise from the bed to go help the priest, whose blood is being drunk by Tibb. Soon, Tibb arrives in Tom's room. Hanging from the ceiling over the bed, Tibb tells Tom that he sees his future: Tom will be alone, his master dead, and a girl will love him, betray him and finally die for him. He demands to know what is in the trunks, and Tom tells him the trunks contain the death of Tibb and the Pendle clans. In the morning, Father Stocks is weak from loss of blood and near death. Tom climbs out a window and runs to Downham but finds the Spook gone; Alice tells him that Tom's brother James, having received the word Tom left that he was headed for Pendle, arrived during the night and he and the Spook set out together. They leave a note for the Spook, and together, Tom and Alice head back to Read Hall to save Father Stocks. On the way, Alice tells Tom that Mab Mouldheel has made an offer: if they help her get the trunks for herself, she will help them free Tom's family through a tunnel under the Tower. When they get back to Read Hall, they find Father Stocks has been stabbed to death by Mistress Wurmalde and that she has told the returned Magistrate Nowell that the murderer is Tom, whom she caught trying to rob the house in the night. Tom is thrown in a cell, but Alice gets away. Wurmalde visits Tom in his cell and demands the trunk keys, but he refuses (the keys must be given willingly to work). The constable places Tom in stocks and takes him to the Tower to meet up with the Magistrate and the army battalion he has brought. The battalion begin a siege of the Tower, firing cannonballs at the walls surrounding it throughout the day but not breaching it. That night, Tom (still in stocks and now hungry and dehydrated) makes a run for it, but sees witches led by Mab Mouldheel surrounding the sleeping soldiers and decides he can't leave them to die. The soldiers were drugged just like Father Stocks had been and won't wake. Tom tells Mab that he'll give her the trunks if she spares the soldiers lives, so she does and takes Tom with her to meet Alice, who is with her sisters. Tom promises Mab the keys to all three trunks after she helps him rescue his family, and she agrees. She takes him and Alice through a mausoleum in an old graveyard and into a tunnel that enters the Tower. Tom and Alice rescue Mab from a wight (a dead sailor reanimated by dark magic) and Alice forces Mab to give her the lock of Alice's hair that Mab had been using to bind Alice, then burns it. They reach the cell where Tom's family is being held. Jack's mind has fled, and Ellie tells Tom he has been that way since they left the farm. Tom thinks this may have been caused when the witches forced Jack to enter the protected room to get the trunks for them, as Mam had said that no one but Tom and Alice should ever enter that room. Their one candle goes out and unable to find their way back down through the tunnels, they decide to all go up into the Tower and try to make their escape once the cannons breach the walls. Tom and Alice carry Jack. When they hear the drawbridge being opened, they go up and find the three trunks in front of it. The Malkin witches fled the Tower when the soldiers breached it, but now the soldiers are leaving ‚Äì invaders have arrived from overseas to attack the country, and war is beginning. Mab had seen it coming through her scrying, and timed everything so that now her Mouldheel clan could arrive and take the trunks. Mab says her clan will not join with the Deanes and the Malkins to raise the Fiend, but will take over the Tower for themselves. Tom refuses to give Mab the keys, but when Mab holds a knife to little Mary's throat, he gives in. Mab opens the first trunk and finds Mam's wedding gown, some vials of liquid, bags full of gold, books in Greek, and a letter to Tom, also in Greek. It says that only he can open the other two trunks, in moonlight, and that Mam's two sisters sleep inside them and will protect Tom with their own lives if necessary. Without telling Mab what is in the other two trunks, he agrees to open them that night if Alice and his family are set free, and Mab lets them go. As the moon shines that night, Tom opens the two trunks. When the moon shines on the two winged, feral lamia witches inside, they spring to life. They sniff and recognise Tom as their kin, but chase Mab and her clan from the Tower (which Mab has already had masons repair). Before she leaves, Mab tells Tom that to take revenge upon him, the Mouldheels will now join with the other two clans after all and bring the Fiend into the world. Tom now knows that his own mother is a lamia witch. He stays inside the Tower, and that night Alice returns with the Spook and Tom's brother James. Alice tells Tom that she left his brother Jack with her aunt, Agnes Sowerbutts, who is tending to him. The Spook and James had been busy rousing the men of Downham and helping them to chase the Deane clan out of town. The next day, James goes back to Downham to rally the men to come to the Tower. The Spook stays behind to release the tormented spirits of all the people ever murdered in the Tower, while Tom and Alice go to Agnes Sowerbutts‚Äô to get Jack, Ellie and Mary and bring them into the safety of the Tower. Agnes uses a mirror to spy on Mab and sees her plotting with Mistress Wurmalde and Tibb. Jack is physically recovered but still confused and unable to speak. He, Ellie and Mary go with Tom and Alice back to the Tower. The next day, Tom and the Spook set out to deal with Mistress Wurmalde and Tibb at Read Hall. They find Magistrate Nowell's body and see that Tibb killed him and drank his blood. But Tibb himself is dying, having been abandoned by Wurmalde; his life was only meant to last nine weeks, and is coming to an end. He tells Tom that Mam gave up her immortality and sentenced herself to serve a mortal man ‚Äì Tom's father ‚Äì as penance for her ill deeds as a lamia and that she fashioned Tom as her weapon against the Dark. The Spook kills Tibb. Back at the Tower, Alice has used some of the potions in Mam's trunk to create a cure for Jack's mind, and he is sleeping under its effects. Alice, Tom and the Spook set out once again to Downham. By night, James leads the village men to confront the gathered witches while Tom, Alice and the Spook try to capture the leader, Mistress Wurmalde. They almost fail, but the two lamia witches swoop down from the sky and scatter the witches, and one of them kills Wurmalde. Mab gets away, but not before telling Alice that the ritual to raise the Fiend has already been completed and they are too late. The Spook tells Tom to get back to his family farm and lock himself in his mother's room that no evil can enter; the Fiend will be under the witches‚Äô control for two days, and if Tom can survive that long, the Fiend will be free in the world and move on to other mischief. On the way home, Tom is intercepted by Mab, who tells him she did it all because she loved him and he betrayed her. She also tells him that even if the Fiend doesn't get him, the Malkins have sent Grimalkin the Witch Assassin after him. Tom runs for hours and is almost home when Grimalkin catches up to him. He lets her think he is surrendering to death at her hands, then uses the blade of his staff to pin her to a tree. As he turns to run, Grimalkin hurls a blade at him. Unconsciously, Tom slows time and plucks the blade out of the air, then makes it into the house and the safety of the protected room. Although he hears the Fiend outside, it cannot enter the room, and Tom falls asleep, exhausted. When he wakes, the ghost of Father Stocks appears to him and tells him it is in despair and cannot find hope. Tom helps the priest to focus on a good memory, and he is able to enter the light, his soul free. Daylight enters the room, and Tom knows that two days have passed and he can leave the room. It is his fourteenth birthday. Some weeks later, Tom is back at Chipenden with the Spook and Alice. James has moved back to the family farm with Jack, Ellie and Mary and is helping to look after them while Jack continues his recovery. The Fiend is loose in the world, but not actively hunting Tom for now. Characters *Thomas J.

Key collaborators  Jade Gordon, Malik Gaines, and Alexandro Segade at the My Barbarian Post-Party Dream State Caucus at the New Museum in November 2016. * Malik Gaines (b. 1973, Visalia, California) Gaines received a B.A. in History from UCLA (1996), an MFA in Writing from Cal Arts' School of Critical Studies (1999) and a PhD in Theater and Performance Studies from UCLA (2011). He is currently an associate professor in the Department of Performance Studies at New York University. Alongside his performance practice, Gaines is a writer and scholar whose work has been published in Art Journal, Women & Performance, Artforum, and BOMB Magazine. Gaines is the author of Black Performance on the Outskirts of the Left: A History of the Impossible, which analyzes black art and music in the 1960s to trace out how performances of blackness rescripts and retools dominant discourses which constrain and contain black life. Reading artists through three registers‚Äîblackness (which he calls the \\"vanguard of negativity, the avant-garde of difference\\"), the period of the 1960s, and the transnational routes between the United States, West Africa, and Western Europe‚ÄîGaines explores how the \\"destabilizing excess of difference\\" challenge visual representation across sexual, racial, and political lines. For instance, in the first chapter \\"Nina Simone's Quadruple Consciousness,\\" Gaines riffs on W. E. B. Du Bois' double consciousness to explore Nina Simone's \\"performance position that marshals paradoxical and simultaneous differences to present a provisional form of subjectivity.\\" Drawing from Simone's Four Women and her performance practice of interjection, Gaines locates the political affect of Simone's work through the tensions inherent to the spaces between the multiple narratives, singer, and audience, reworking gendered, racialized fragmentation towards an act of political and personal agency. * Jade Gordon (b. 1975, Santa Rosa, California).

Common names include Brompton stock, common stock, hoary stock, ten-week stock, and gilly-flower. The common name stock usually refers to this species, though it may also be applied to the whole genus. The common name \\"night-scented stock\\" or \\"evening-scented stock\\" is applied to Matthiola longipetala. It is a common garden flower, available in a variety of colours, many of which are heavily scented and also used in floristry. Description Some stocks are grown as annuals (the \\"ten-week stocks\\") that reach heights of growth of 20 to 28 centimeters thick, woody at the base and with numerous foliar scars and branches with terminal rosettes of leaves. The plants are starry, with whitish hairs. The leaves are rounded and ash-coloured. The fragrant flowers are white, cream yellow, pink, red, purple or blue. The scar flaps on the back are swollen. The pods are compressed, their flaps are flattened. Leaves whole or slightly sinuate, lanceolate, attenuated on a short petiole. Pedicels are 10-12 mm in anthesis, 12-17 mm in fruiting, erect- patents. Sepals are around 11-14 mm, with narrow scarious margin, subtle, green or somewhat purple. Petals are 25-30 mm, with a nail almost as long as the limb, ranging between white, pink, violet or purple. Seeds are 2-3 mm, suborbicular, with a whitish wing. The flower is supported by a 10-20 mm stalk.Hickman, JC 1993. The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California 1-1400. University of California Press , Berkeley. Distribution It is native to southern Europe (from the Balearics to the former Yugoslavia) and is naturalized in the western part of the Mediterranean region, roughly in the areal of the olive tree. The plant prefers calcareous soils, and often grows on cliffs overlooking the sea, or on old walls. It is a plant of the coast, but it can be found, naturalized, even in the hinterland up to 600 m of altitude.Sandro Pignatti, Flora of Italy , vol. 1, Bologna, Edagricole, 1982, p. 394, Usage Double-flowered stock, Matthiola incana The flower is widely used as an ornamental plant for summer discounts and as a cut flower and aromatic plant. It is grown in the ground for the spring ornament of the gardens or in pots. It is very suitable for the cracks in the reefs of the marine locations. The species has been in culture since at least the 16th century. The flowers can be simple or filled, medium or large.Eckehart J. J√§ger, Friedrich Ebel, Peter Hanelt, Gerd K. M√ºller (ed.): Rothmaler - excursion flora of Germany. Volume 5: Herbaceous ornamental and useful plants . Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg 2008, . Varieties These varieties are sown in spring (generally from March onwards in colder areas of the Northern Hemisphere, earlier in regions with mild winters). They give a good summer flower display. Other varieties take longer to develop and are treated as biennials. These are often referred to as \\"Brompton stocks\\". In cool temperate regions they are generally sown in summer (June and July) to flower in the following spring. The extra trouble of overwintering the plants is compensated for by the showy spring floral display. In hard winters there may be some mortality and a well-drained sheltered site suits them best.Jaakko Jalas, Juha Suominen: Atlas Florae Europaeae . Volume 10. Helsinki 1994. Pages 112-113. Intermediate varieties (sometimes called \\"East Lothian\\" stocks as they originated in southern Scotland) may be treated either as annuals or biennials. If treated as annuals they give a fine late summer and autumn display. Maltese stocks (Matthiola incana ssp. melitensis), known in Maltese as \\"ƒ°i≈ºi ta' Malta\\", is treated as a perennial and has fleshier and fuzzy leaves with flowers in a light violet colour, while an even rarer variety of it exhibits white flowers. http://www.maltawildplants.com/CRUC/Matthiola_incana_subsp_melitensis.php 'Cinderella series' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Genetics Double-flowered stocks are prized by gardeners for their floral display but are sterile. They therefore have to be produced from the seed of single-flowered plants. The double-flowered form is caused by a recessive gene variant (allele) in the homozygous condition. Therefore, according to the Mendelian laws of genetics, heterozygous single-flowered stocks should produce one quarter doubles in their offspring and one third of the singles should be pure breeding singles incapable of throwing doubles. Selection over the centuries has greatly improved these ratios, resulting in the so-called \\"ever-sporting\\" stocks, in which pure-breeding singles are absent and the proportion of doubles is one half or greater. The reason was first worked out by the Danish geneticist √òjvind Winge.O. Winge, 1931, The inheritance of double flowers and other characters in Matthiola. Zeitschrift f√ºr Z√ºchtung, Reihe a Pflanzenz√ºchtung, 17: 118-35 In these varieties, the singleness allele is closely linked to a pollen-lethal gene. Thus the pollen (male) contribution to seed is always a doubleness allele, while the female contribution is either a doubleness or a singleness allele. The result of this linkage is that doubles and singles are produced in 50:50 ratios and there are no pure-breeding singles. Furthermore, many modern strains produce doubles in even higher proportions: 60% or even 80%. This is due to generations of selection for further linked viability effects, producing higher mortality of heterozygous singles, relative to homozygous doubles.

The house once belonged to the Count and Countess von Hallwyl, but was donated to the Swedish state in 1920 to eventually become a museum. In 1938, the museum was officially opened. History Hallwyl House () was built 1893-1898 to the design of Isak Gustaf Clason for Count and his wife, Wilhelmina. It was created to accommodate the office of the count and the extensive art collection of the countess. Wilhelmina and Walther von Hallwyl also lived there during the winter. While the exterior of the building and the court is historical in style ‚Äî borrowing architectural elements from medieval prototypes and Renaissance Venice ‚Äî it was utterly modern on its completion ‚Äî including electricity, central heating, telephones, and bathrooms. The elevator was a later addition. The countess collected her artworks during her worldwide journeys in order to found a museum, and, consequently, the palace was donated to the Swedish State in 1920, a decade before her death. The museum, including many of the rooms where they used to live, opened in 1938 to the public. Hallwyl Museum, in association with Skokloster Castle and the Royal Armoury, is part of a government agency known as the Royal Armoury and Skokloster Castle with the Hallwyl Museum Foundation, or Livrustkammaren och Skoklosters slott med Stiftelsen Hallwylska museet (LSH) in Swedish.  Collections  Hallwyl House was donated to the Swedish state on the condition that it would remain unchanged. Today, the house has been preserved as it was when Countess von Hallwyl donated the house.

Early life Born in New York City, Arnold started his career acting in summer stock and doing comedy in vaudeville. During World War II, he served in the United States Marine Corps in the South Pacific. He later moved to Hollywood to continue a career in show business. Career Arnold appeared in films as an actor opposite the comic duo Martin and Lewis, and also wrote the screenplay for the Martin and Lewis vehicle The Caddy (1953). In 1956, Arnold started writing for such television series as The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show and The Rosemary Clooney Show. In the 1960s, he began writing and producing episodes for such sitcoms as The Real McCoys, Bewitched, and That Girl. Regarding Bewitched, which he produced for its first season, Arnold noted, \\"With this show, I saw a great opportunity to accomplish something. Fantasy can always be a jumping-off place for more sophisticated work.\\" Though his subsequent work was popular with audiences, Arnold frequently butted heads with TV executives regarding issues of content and fair shooting schedules. Television sitcom writer-director Ken Levine described Arnold as \\"brilliant, unpredictable (a nice term for bi-polar), demanding, and kind.\\" Tapings on Barney Miller became legendary for lasting into the wee hours as Arnold worked on rewrites; due to these extended tapings the show in its later seasons ceased having a live audience. While working on Barney Miller, Arnold became so sick of the constant network battles that he founded his own distribution company Pro-Synd, Inc., so he could syndicate shows as he wished, but with the cancellation of his subsequent series Joe Bash and Stat, his plans for Barney Miller never came to fruition. He eventually sued regarding what he felt was the unfair sharing of the profits from Barney Miller and got a $50 million settlement. On August 28, 1986, Danny Arnold sold his production company Four D Productions, Inc. to Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures Television Group for $50 million after Arnold dropped the federal and state lawsuits against Columbia Pictures Industries accusing them of antitrust violations, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. Arnold won two Emmy Awards, one for My World and Welcome to It and one for the series for which he is most famous, Barney Miller. This latter show also won Arnold a Peabody Award. He was honored with the Paddy Chayefsky Award in 1985 by the Writer's Guild of America to celebrate his lifetime of achievement.

His first marriage was to the daughter of songwriter Ray Gilbert, actress Joanne Gilbert, in 1955. The marriage ended the following year. Arnold met his second wife, Donna, while he was working as a writer on The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show and she was appearing as a singer and dancer on the program. They married in 1961 and had two children, David and Dannel. The couple remained married until Arnold's death. Death On August 19, 1995, Arnold died of heart failure at his Los Angeles home at the age of 70. He is buried at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

In 1930, Hungarian scientist Theodore von K√°rm√°n accepted the directorship of the lab and emigrated to the United States. Under his leadership, work on rockets began there in 1936. GALCIT was the first‚Äîand from 1936 to 1940 the only‚Äîuniversity-based rocket research center. Based on GALCIT's JATO project at the time, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was established under a contract with the United States Army in November 1943. In 1961 the GALCIT acronym was retained while the name changed to Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology. In 2006, during the Directorship of Ares Rosakis, GALCIT was once again renamed, taking on the new name Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (while continuing to maintain the acronym GALCIT) in order to reflect its vigorous re-engagement with space engineering and with JPL.  Founding  Daniel Guggenheim and his son, Harry Guggenheim (an aviator) established the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics on June 16, 1926. Between 1926 and 1930 the fund disbursed $3 million, making grants that established schools or research centers at New York University, Stanford University, the University of Michigan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Washington, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Syracuse University, Northwestern University, the University of Akron, and the California Institute of Technology. It was the Guggenheims who, along with Caltech president Robert Andrews Millikan, convinced von K√°rm√°n to emigrate to the United States and become director of GALCIT. Eventually, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) became so concerned about GALCIT's growing influence over West coast aviation, it erected the Ames Laboratory in Sunnyvale, California in part to deter an ever-widening aeronautical gap that had formed between NACA and GALCIT.

In early 1936, with the aid of a graduate assistant to von K√°rm√°n, William Bollay, Malina and two rocket enthusiasts -- Jack Parsons and Edward S. Forman‚Äîbegan the GALCIT Rocket Research Project. They were soon joined by two GALCIT graduate students, Tsien Hsue-shen and A.M.O. Smith. In October they tested for the first time their gaseous oxygen - methyl alcohol rocket motor. They used an area of the Arroyo Seco on the western edge of Pasadena, \\"a stone‚Äôs throw from the present-day Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\\" After a series of tests, they tested the motor in that location for the last time in January 1937; it ran for 44 seconds at a chamber pressure of 75 psi. In March, Weld Arnold, then an assistant in the Astrophysical Laboratory at Caltech, joined the group as a photographer. Tests of a motor that used nitrogen dioxide as the oxidizer were conducted in the GALCIT lab. A misfire of that motor gained the project the nickname, \\"The Suicide Squad.\\" During 1938 Smith went to work for Douglas Aircraft. Arnold left Caltech for New York. Tsien devoted more of his time to completing his doctorate. Malina, Parsons and Forman continued with the project. Take-off on August 12, 1941 of America's first \\"rocket-assisted\\" fixed-wing aircraft, an Ercoupe fitted with a GALCIT developed solid propellant JATO booster. In early 1939, the National Academy of Sciences provided $1,000 to von K√°rm√°n and the Rocket Research Group to research rocket-assisted take-off of aircraft. This JATO research was the first rocket research to receive financial support from the U.S. government. In 1942, Rolf Sabersky was hired to work in mechanical design on the Southern California Cooperative Wind Tunnel under Mark Serrurier and Hap Richards.  U.S. Army missiles  In 1943 the Army Air Forces asked GALCIT to study the possible use of rockets to propel long-range missiles. In response, Malina and Tsien wrote a report dated 20 November 1943, which was the first document to use the Jet Propulsion Laboratory name. Von K√°rm√°n added a cover memorandum, signing it as \\"Director, Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\\" but as far as Caltech was concerned JPL did not yet formally exist. In early 1944 the United States Army asked GALCIT to develop missiles for field use, which led to the development of the Private, Corporal, and Sergeant missiles. The Army Ordnance Corps established the ORDCIT Project, and JPL/GALCIT was formally organized to carry out this work.

Built between late-1911 and early-1912, it is a designated 'heritage' site and is Toronto's oldest standing movie theatre in use for showing movies. It operated continuously as a movie theatre from its opening until June 2006, making it the oldest continuously running movie theatre in Ontario. When news of its closure became public, a grass-roots community movement sprang up in order to save the cinema. After a great deal of effort, the movement was ultimately successful and the Revue reopened in October 2007. It is now operated by the not-for-profit Revue Film Society.  History  The Art Deco Edwardian cinema was built between 1911 and 1912 by the Suburban Amusement Company. At the time, Roncesvalles Avenue was on the suburban western edge of the City of Toronto. The area as being developed intensively and the local population was increasing. The cinema was successful and operated as a first-run theatre from its opening date until 1972 when it became a repertory cinema. In the 1980s, the Revue became part of the Festival Theatres chain of repertory cinemas in Toronto, which also included the Fox, Royal and Kingsway theatres. In 2004, the Festival Theatres founder died, and in April 2006, the founder's family announced their intentions to close all of the theatres except the Fox. The family found it financially impossible to continue due to the rise of DVDs and the shorter period of public exhibition of films available to repertory cinemas. The last show of the Festival era was on June 30, 2006, showing Lawrence of Arabia. When news of the Revue's closure became public, a grass- roots community movement sprang up in order to save the cinema. The movement founded the Revue Film Society to explore ways to re-open the cinema for film showing. The building's owners put the building up for sale, with the intent to sell to new owners prepared to re-open the cinema. While the theatre was shut, the marquee, known for its tendency to hold water and snow, collapsed on February 19, 2007, most likely due to the weight of a recent snowfall. Portions of the marquee were placed in storage for eventual restoration. The movement to save the cinema was ultimately successful. On June 12, 2007, a press conference was held in front of the Revue Cinema, announcing the purchase of the Revue by local residents Danny and Letty Mullin. The Mullins lease the Revue building to the Revue Film Society to operate. The cinema re- opened on October 4, 2007, with a screening of Some Like It Hot.

History The first church in Bishopsworth was a small chapel dedicated to St Peter and St Paul built under an arrangement in 1194 between Robert Arthur, lord of the manor, and George de Dunster, prebendary of Bedminster. The agreement provided for a chaplain to visit from Bedminster on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. This provision continued until dissolution in 1540. The chapel was converted into three cottages which stood until the Corporation demolished them in 1961 to make way for a swimming pool. The present church, dedicated to St Peter, was built in 1841‚Äì43. The neo-Norman design was the work of Samuel Charles Fripp. Construction started on the current church in 1841 and was not completed until 1842 or 1843. The church's planned tower was never completed on time. It became a parish church in 1853. It is little altered except for a vestry / porch which was added in 1877. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. The churchyard contains war graves of four soldiers, from the airman and Royal Navy and a sailor of World War II.

It began publication in 1826 and by the mid-1830s had become the largest circulating weekly in the United States, with more than 30,000 subscribers and an estimated 150,000 readers. The Methodist Book concern was authorized by the General Conference to publish The Christian Advocate for 147 years. Its publishing location would change as the Methodist Church expanded westward and the slavery issue divided the church in 1844 . After the church united again, what had become a monthly magazine was finally edited in Chicago and printed in Nashville, Tennessee in 1939. It was first a weekly broadsheet, and later a monthly magazine for Methodist families. In the intervening years, The Advocate name was part of the name of numerous Methodist journals published by local conferences and jurisdictions of the church. The last chapter of the Christian Advocate magazine was reported in Time magazine's Religion section (Oct. 11, 1956): In 1959 editors of The New Christian Advocate changed the name back to The Christian Advocate and its format from pocket size to full size, with circulation bi-monthly. In 1973, due to declining circulation, the United Methodist Board of Publishing authorized the replacement of both magazines with a pocket-sized magazine entitled United Methodists Today. A supplement for pastors was published, Today's Ministry. Both magazines ended in 1975.

The church is located on 17th Street between Paulina Street and Ashland Ave in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. St. Adalbert has served generations of Polish immigrants and their American-born children; at its peak, parish membership numbered 4,000 families with more than 2,000 children enrolled in the school. Today the church is an anchor for the Mexican immigrants that have made the Pilsen area their home. In June 2019, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced that the church would permanently close on July 15, 2019. History of Saint Adalbert's St. Adalbert's parish was founded in 1874, and initially served the Polish Catholic community. In more recent years, the church served the Pilsen neighborhood where it is located, which has a substantial Mexican population, and has masses in Polish language as well as Spanish. A shrine of the Mexican patroness Our Lady of Guadalupe is part of the church premises. In June 2019, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced that the church would permanently close on July 15, 2019. Reasons for the church's closure included declining attendance, demographic changes in the Pilsen neighborhood, and over $3 million in repairs needed to maintain the church's crumbling building. The church's operations will be combined with the nearby St. Paul's Catholic Church. Church design and decoration The church and adjoining rectory were designed by the prolific Chicago catholic church architect, Henry J. Schlacks. It was completed at an estimated cost of $200,000. The interior is modeled after the papal basilica of San Paolo fuori le mura (built between 386 AD and ca. 450, burned 1823 and rebuilt 1825-54) and closely resembles several other churches designed by Schlacks including the St. Mary of the Lake in Chicago (1913-17. Not to be confused with the seminary of the same name), Resurrection in Chicago (1914-17. Later demolished), St. Mark's in Cincinnati (1914-16), St. Joan of Arc in Indianapolis (1928-29), and the Chapel of Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament in Marytown/Libertyville, Illinois (1928-32. Since 2000, the National Shrine of St. Maximilian Kolbe). The Roman basilica style was first brought to the United States from Germany and the United Kingdom around 1905 through the dioceses of Pittsburgh and Buffalo and Schlacks was one of its earliest advocates. Although the nave of St. Adalbert's is inspired by Roman churches which pre-date the Renaissance, the exterior is dressed symmetrically with a pair of 185-foot baroque towers to conform its overall appearance with the so- called 'Polish Cathedral style' befitting the parish church of a largely Polish congregation. In this case, Schlacks seems to have taken the towers of the nineteenth-century St. Stephen's Basilica in Budapest as his loose inspiration. One enters through a shallow portico with eight massive grey- flecked, rose-colored polished granite columns, from there to pass through a narrow vestibule with four large recessed fonts in its back wall, and finally to enter the immense main body where one finds the most magnificent marble work to be found in any church in Chicago. A stern large white-marble statue of the church's patron St. Adalbert, the evangelizer of Poland and martyr, stares down from the massive and elaborate thirty-five ton Cararra marble altar whose ten spiral pillars are capped with a dome-shaped ciborium. On the chancel arch above the altar are inscribed the opening words of the Polish hymn Bogurodzica which Adalbert himself is said to have composed. And in an F. X. Zettler window to the west, Adalbert again, in green vestments, stands preaching to the surly, slumped Prussian, an unwilling listener whose response would be to martyr Adalbert. Legend says that the King of Poland Boles≈Çaw I ransomed back Adalbert's body by paying its weight in gold. The original balustered white-marble altar rail complements the white marble of the many- tiered altar behind and above it and serves the additional aesthetic purpose of visually reinforcing the line made by the pilasters which demark the north wall. The altar rail also complements the original high, white marble pulpit. Square and elaborately carved with large figures of the four evangelists on its corners and smaller figures of the six prophets on its sides, it rises west of the sanctuary against one of the ponderous beige-and-grey marble pillars with gold capitals that line the nave on either side. The white- marble side altars have paintings of Our Lady and St. Joseph respectively instead of the more customary statues. The original east transept marble shrine holding the Piet√† (once matched by a similar shrine in the west transept) is still intact. The mural on the upper portion of the north wall above the sanctuary portrays on the left the wedding of Queen Jadwiga of Poland and Prince Jagiello of Lithuania and on the right the 1655 victory of Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa when by the Virgin's intervention an army of 9,000 invading Swedes failed to take a monastery held by only 250 monks. The predominant muted orange-red tones of the mural are repeated in the present color of the ambulatory wall and also in the ceiling coffers and panels of the clerestory. Although these panels and coffers are painted in this solid color today, it is possible that they were originally intended for murals such as the large ones of St. Francis and St. Anthony in the west transept and the others of various subjects that have been completed in the panels around the main lower body of the church. The pews retain their period-authentic molasses-dark varnish; both their finish and their classical broken-curve top ornamentation matches that of the original confessionals in the east transept. On the south (or entrance) end of the church rises a spectacular two-story choir loft with curving ranges of organ pipes on either side and a rose window of St. Cecilia in the center. The aisle floors are a handsome inlay of sections of red, black, and gray terrazzo . Alterations and losses Several rows of pews have been removed from the back, truncating Schlacks's long processional aisle. The floor where the pews were removed has been patched with vinyl tile that attempts to match the pattern and colors of the surrounding tan and black terrazzo floor. The original nave chandeliers are gone. The original brass communion rail is gone. The west transept shrine has been truncated to accommodate a new baptistry. A large polychrome rood (crucifix) which may have originally hung in the sanctuary has been placed in the remaining portion of the west transept shrine to which has been added a false back to bring the surface out to meet the back of the crucifix.

It is known for its caf√©s and for the Church of St Luke, which is situated at the top end. The bottom end leads into the area surrounding Clayton Square, which is part of the main retail district of central Liverpool. The bottom end contains more shops which are chain stores. Liverpool Central, a major hub of the Merseyrail rapid transit/commuter rail network, can also be accessed via an entrance on Bold Street next to The Lyceum, a post office which was Europe's first lending library. The middle area contains bars as it leads towards Concert Square, a square containing clubs and bars, and the top end contains more independent shops and cafes. For the most part, Bold Street is pedestrianised and cars do not have access.  History Bold Street was originally laid out as a ropewalk; a long thin area of land used in the manufacture of rope (the area is now known as 'Rope Walks'). They used to measure the rope from the top of Bold Street to the bottom because it was the standard length needed for sailing ships. It was laid out for residences around 1780 and named after Jonas Bold, a noted slave merchant, sugar trader and banker. In 1802 Bold became Mayor of Liverpool. Merchants that worked on the docks needed houses close by. Therefore, houses were constructed in Hanover Street first, followed by Duke Street and then Bold Street. The fields that were in the area earlier were also developed quickly into houses. Although there had been port-related industrial activity in the area, with roperies occupying the site of what is now Bold Street to supply the sailing ships, this intensified along with a demand for residential properties so that the merchants could be located close to their business interests.Pavement Art from the Bold Street Festival Notable buildings and places of interest *The Lyceum *Liverpool Social Forum *Concert Square References in popular culture The street is featured in a song of the same name by Liverpool-based singer-songwriter Eugene McGuinness, included on his debut EP, 'The Early Learnings of...', distributed by Domino Records in 2007.

This move reflected the increasing importance of satellite observations to NOAA's environmental science and service responsibilities. It was largely precipitated by a decision by the Carter Administration in November 1979 to assign NOAA management responsibility for all civil operational remote sensing from space. NESDIS was formed in 1982 with the merger of NESS and the Environmental Data Service. NESDIS has managed operational polar orbiting satellites (POES) since 1966. Additionally, NESDIS has managed operational geosynchronous satellites (GOES) satellites since 1974. New generations of satellites are being developed to succeed the current polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites: the Joint Polar Satellite System) and GOES-R. The first satellite in the GOES-R series is scheduled for launch in October 2016. JPSS-1 successfully launched on November 18, 2017.

It is one of the oldest cycle sport organisations in the world, formed in 1888. Remit Records are established by riders performing time trials covering set distances (e.g. 25, 50 or 100 miles), prescribed periods of time (12 or 24 hours), or between places (e.g. London to Brighton and back, Land's End to John o' Groats). Riders can compete on single bicycles or tricycles and tandem bicycles or tandem tricycles, with records accepted for men, women and, in the tandem categories, mixed teams. Records for set distances can be established on straight-out courses which may incorporate significant downhills and strong tail-winds. This contrasts with records established in conventional time trials, where the start and finish points are required to be within a short distance of each other to neutralise the impact of gradients and weather. Early history From 1890, the National Cyclists' Union (an association established to organise and regulate UK bicycle racing) had banned all cycle racing on public roads. However, certain exceptions were made - first record-breaking and then time trials. A J Wilson, president of the North Road Cycling Club, convened a meeting in 1888 at which the Road Records Association was founded with the object of certifying the claims of male cyclists on the road, and setting standards for the timing and authentication of records. The Women's Road Record Association (WRRA) was formed in 1934, and merged with the RRA in 1989. Frederick Thomas Bidlake was a record-breaker in the 1880s, and later in demand as a timekeeper. He was a member of the RRA committee for many years, and president from 1924 until his death in 1933. Records The RRA recognises records for: Regional Groups Autonomous groups of the RRA focus on record-breaking within their own respective parts of the country. * Eastern Counties RRA - Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk * Midland RRA - West Midlands, Warwichshire, Hereford & worcester, Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Derbyshire, Avon * Northern RRA - Northumberland, Westmorland, Durham, Cumberland, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Flint, Denbighshire and parts of Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire * North & West Home Counties RRA - Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk west of the Great Ouse, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire south of the river Trent, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Surrey * RRA of Scotland - all Scottish roads * Southern RRA - South-East England (mostly south of the Thames, east of the London-Southampton route) * Welsh RRA - all Welsh roads * Western Counties RRA - Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Avon, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire east of the Severn, west Hampshire External links * Road Records Association ** RRA regional summary ** Eastern Counties RRA (as part of Eastern Counties Cycling Association) ** Midland RRA ** Northern RRA ** North & West Home Counties RRA Category:Cycle racing in the United Kingdom Category:Cycling organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Sports organizations established in 1888 Category:1888 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Road Records Association"},{"id":"10441961","text":"Heather Thatcher (3 September 1896 ‚Äì 15 January 1987) was an English actress in theatre and films. Dancer By 1922 Thatcher was a dancer. She was especially noted for her interpretation of an Egyptian harem dance. Her exotic clothes were designed in Russia. They featured stencil slits in the waist, trouserettes and sleeves. Her attire was billed as the boldest costume ever shown in Britain. English theatre Thatcher played the feminine lead in London stage productions like Oh Daddy and Warm Corner. At the London Winter Garden she sang and danced in a revue in 1923. In August 1926, she appeared in Thy Name Is Woman at the Q Theatre. It marked her graduation from musical comedy to serious acting. She continued her London stage work, performing with June Clyde in Lucky Break. Premiering at the Strand Theatre in September 1934, the theatrical presentation was a production of Leslie Henson. In 1937, Thatcher went to America in Full House. The previous season, she was paired with Ivor Novello in the English rendition. Jack Buchanan, Austin Trevor and Coral Browne teamed with Thatcher in Canaries Sometimes Sing (1947). Produced by Firth Shephard, the theatrical presentation opened in Blackpool and moved to London a month later. Thatcher participated in a Salute To Ivor Novello at the London Coliseum in September 1951. The production raised funds to run his old home, Redroofs. It had been purchased by the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Film career The Plaything (1929), produced by Castleton Knight and Elstree Studios, begins as a silent film. It develops into an audible film which is recorded in good quality for its time. The theme concerns a Highland laird who falls in love with a hedonistic London heiress. Thatcher plays a prominent role as Martyn Bennett. In 1931 she visited Hollywood while attending the wedding of James Gleason. As a star of English comedy, she was being compared to Marilyn Miller, Thatcher wore a monocle to the marriage ceremony. In the autumn of 1931 she was invited to a reception following the premiere of Strictly Dishonorable (1931), at the Carthay Circle Theatre. Among her friends in films were Anthony Bushell and Zelma O'Neal. Thatcher was signed by MGM in February 1932. She was given a feature role in But The Flesh Is Weak (1932). The film stars Robert Montgomery and is directed by Jack Conway. The film was adapted from a British stage production which showcased Novello. Thatcher was praised for her performance. German actress, Nora Gregor was found disappointing. The English actress \\"gives a brilliant performance and creates the only human being in the piece.\\" Thatcher sued Gloria Swanson British Productions for breach of contract in a suit which was settled in December 1933. During the filming of Perfect Understanding (1933) Thatcher's contract was cancelled before the production was completed. No explanation was given. She was excluded from the film when a new author was hired. The replacement writer chose to eliminate her character. The Private Life of Don Juan (1934) was also filmed at Elstree Studios. The film has Douglas Fairbanks Sr. as its leading man. Owen Nares plays the title role and Thatcher is Anna Dora, one of the ladies. Later in her career Thatcher returned to Britain to make films. Among these is Will Any Gentleman...? (1953), filmed at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood. Thatcher appears together with George Cole and Veronica Hurst. The film was a short adventure about a hypnotist who puts a man in a trance. Thatcher made her last films in 1955. The Deep Blue Sea has a screenplay written by Terence Rattigan and features Vivien Leigh and Kenneth More. Thatcher depicts Aunt May Luton in Josephine and Men, a comedy starring Glynis Johns and Peter Finch. Death Thatcher died in Hillingdon, London in 1987.

Affiliated to the CBSE, this is a boys school, one of the oldest schools in Bhopal and considered among the best schools in the city, ranked First in a 2017 listing. Its campus is spread over of land in the locality of Arera Colony. History In July 1965, at the invitation of the Archbishop of Bhopal Eugene D'Souza, Fr. Emmanuel Ferdinand More, a Spanish Jesuit belonging to the Province of Mumbai, established a school which he named Campion School after St. Edmund Campion, a sixteenth- century English Jesuit who would also be the patron of the school. The School moved from place to place to find a location with a proper school setting. It held classes first at Seva Sadan, which had no room for expansion for the increasing number of students. Therefore, Fr. More, the first principal, negotiated with the government for leasing a larger piece of land, about a patch, near No.10 bus stop. He built the school in a \\"barracks\\" fashion and extended the classes from Std IV to Std XI. It opened 17 July 1967. These buildings, \\"Old Campion\\", were returned to the government in 1974. On 21 February 1969 Fr. More acquired of land in Shahapura, the present site of Campion School, in the name of Bombay Xaverian Corporation. \\"The Campion School Society\\" was registered on 1 April 1972 and construction of the building began. Campion School was moved into an incomplete building on the present site in July 1974. In the same year classes from KGI to Std. III were added. St. Mary's School, run by the sisters of PSOL (Poor Sisters of Our Lady), Mumbai, merged with Campion and its students both boys and girls were admitted to this school. Sr. Eleanor, PSOL, was the headmistress of the primary section. The girls studied at Campion for a year or two before they were admitted into St. Joseph‚Äôs, Idgah Hills, or Carmel Convent School, BHEL. In 1979, the Bombay Jesuit Province handed over the administration of Campion School Society to the Ranchi Province. When Madhya Pradesh became an independent Province, Ranchi handed over Campion to the Madhya Pradesh Jesuits. When the Poor Sisters of Our Lady (PSOL), who had been co-workers with the Jesuits from the year 1974, decided to have their own independent school, St Mary‚Äôs' School at Seva Sadan, the M.P. Jesuits invited the Sisters of the Mercy of the Holy Cross to work with them in the primary school, which they have done since 1982. In 1994 the school changed from the M.P. Board of Secondary Education to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). In 2017 Campion was listed among the top ten CBSE schools in Bhopal. Fr. Alphonse Tirkey, S.J., as principal started a Hindi medium section of the school in July 1993, for those who find instruction through English difficult. School Badge The school badge is in the form of a medieval shield with three major divisions, each with a different colour background, and a scroll containing the school motto ‚ÄúJoy in Truth‚Äù. This motto is symbolically expressed by each of the three main divisions on the shield. On the left side, against a red background is a rope shaped like a noose. It stands for the death of St. Edmund Campion, professedly for the love of truth. On the right side, against a white background are three birds that stand for joy while the star stands for truth. Finally, at the base of the shield is to be found the logo of the Jesuits. It consists of the first three letters of Jesus' name in Greek, Contrary to the popular belief, the background colours do not represent the colours of the four school \\"houses\\". School anthem Campion calls, Campion calls to courage and high chivalry Campion calls, Campion calls to shared responsibility To peace, love and charity; To honour truth and loyalty Campion calls, Campion calls, Campion calls to You and Me. Fair school, thy gracious gifts for mind and soul let me not miss We pray that all thy sons may reach their goal eternal bliss There is a challenge every man must meet who walks by day But Campion steers me, lest my wandering feet from grace should stray. Campion calls, Campion calls to courage and high chivalry Campion calls, Campion calls to shared responsibility To peace, love and charity; To honour truth and loyalty Campion calls, Campion calls, Campion calls to You and Me. A special song was composed for the school's 50th Jubilee. Facilities Front view of secondary section. The school is housed in two separate buildings. The primary or elementary section runs from Pre-K (KG-1) to grade V. The secondary or high school section runs from grade VI to XII. Upgrades and renovations were done in the primary section in 1994 to accommodate more classes and facilities. The campus is interspersed with lawns and tree-lined playgrounds, and many trees and shrubs are planted throughout the campus. The school has an auditorium located in the primary section (which is one of the biggest in the state) and a canteen in the secondary section. Sports facilities include a games room housing sports and other equipment, four basketball courts, one soccer field. Students are also coached in roller skating and have won gold medals in the sport. The school organises an Annual Sports Meet, in which all 4 houses compete. In addition to computer labs in both sections, there are labs for physics, chemistry, biology, in the secondary section. There are libraries only in the secondary sections of the school Annual Function, festival celebrations, and various inter-house and class-level competitions are regularly held. The school annually elects its student leaders. Anyone in 11th or 12th grade meeting the criteria to hold the respective posts can run for office. Campion also publishes its annual school magazine, The Campionite. Academics Since 1994, Campion School has been affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Besides the compulsory study of English (till 12th grade), Hindi (till 10th grade), General Science (10th), Mathematics (10th), Social Sciences (10th), and a number of other graded subjects like moral education and computers, students from grades 6 to 8 have to choose between Sanskrit and Urdu as a third language. All subjects are compulsory until the 10th grade, after which students have the choice between Maths or Biology Stream. The robust education system produces a number of outstanding students each year. Vineet Buch who achieved the 1st Rank in IIT- JEE (Indian Institute of Technology - Joint Entrance Exam) in 1989 is among 50 or so who can claim this achievement on one of the world's toughest entrance examinations. An alumnus of Campion Bhopal, he resides in the United States. By far, Campion School has yielded many famous personalities like Congress Leader and MP Assembly Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, Dr. JS Pandey, Shayaan Raza Khan and several other famous personalities.

It is in Clinton Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Eagle Grange No. 1 was the first grange to be organized in Pennsylvania, two years before the formation of the Pennsylvania State Grange and four years after The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, better known as the National Grange was founded in Fredonia, New York by Oliver Hudson Kelley. The chief objectives of the Eagle Grange No. 1 were the establishment of a co-operative purchasing program for farmers, the lowering of railroad rates, and the establishment of rural free delivery by the United States Postal Service. The Grange was one of the first national organizations to give equal status to female members. Luke Eger, a farmer from Lycoming County, was the driving force behind the formation of Eagle Grange No. 1. He had read about the success of similar farmer's co-operative groups in states like Ohio, Iowa, and Minnesota. Eger contacted Oliver Hudson Kelley who was working for farmer's rights in Washington, D.C. at the time. Kelley encouraged Eger to establish a Grange in Lycoming County. Eger received little support from his friends and neighbors when he first attempted to establish a co- operative. In fact his brother-in-law, Frank Porter, is quoted in saying that Eagle Grange No. 1 was finally established, \\"just to keep peace in the family.\\" Luke Eger wrote to the National Grange in 1871, \\"I have at last succeeded in organizing and raising a club here and think there will be little trouble in establishing clubs in the county.\\" Luke Eger and 39 other farmers began Eagle Grange No. 1 on March 4, 1871 at the base of Bald Eagle Mountain in southern Lycoming County. They quickly set about reaching their goals. One of their most important goals was to set up a plan of co-operative purchasing farming supplies to drive down the prices. Merchants that refused to do business with the co-op were summarily boycotted by the members of the Grange. The farmers from Lycoming County also sought to have the rates charged to them by the railroads lowered and they pushed for rural free delivery from the Post Office. Eger and the other members of Eagle Grange No. 1 were quickly successful in establishing themselves as a force with which to be reckoned. The Pennsylvania State Grange was established on September 18, 1873 in Reading. Representatives from 22 local Granges met on Blenizer's Hall and elected the man who said that the first Pennsylvania Grange was established to \\"keep the peace in the family\\", Frank Porter, as the first Overseer of the Pennsylvania State Grange. The Grange Hall was built in 1887.

The game was released for the Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System) on November 28 of the same year, and is a multi-directional scrolling action game which contains some elements of a top-down shooter. The game is known outside Japan as Boomerang and Farmers Rebellion. Its main character, Gonbe, makes a cameo appearance in Atlantis no Nazo, another Sunsoft game. The game was re-released as part of multiple compilations. A mobile phone version was published on September 19, 2003. A renewed version titled was released over the SoftBank Mobile and EZweb networks in July 2006. Gameplay The game is set in medieval Japan, where a poor farming village is planning an insurrection to overthrow their feudal overlord. However, the only participants in the revolt are the player's character, , and the optional second-player character, , and the player battles against an army of ninjas instead of samurai and foot soldiers. The game displays text in the vertical direction, which was very unusual for a game of the period, and all in-game messages use speech reminiscent of jidaigeki films. Arcade screenshot The character's movement is controlled with an 8-way joystick, and pressing the single button allows the player to attack by throwing a sickle. The direction in which the sickle is thrown cannot be determined by the player, and the weapon will automatically head towards the closest enemy. This forces an emphasis on avoiding attacks rather than attacking aggressively. The right side of the screen displays the player's points, along with a map of the level. The location of koban coins is displayed on this map, but players must circumvent walls and other barriers to go to those locations. This map is not included in the Famicom version of the game. Enemy characters include a black or red ninja, bomber ninja, and wild boar (some of these enemies do not appear in the Famicom version). Red ninjas move faster than all of the other characters and are harder to hit, but yield twice as many points. The player loses a life when they come in contact with any of the enemy characters or projectiles. The game ends when the player loses with no lives remaining. A ghost (or y≈çkai) will also appear on occasion, and the player will be unable to throw their sickle if they come in contact with it. The ghost's effect will dissipate if the player touches the jiz≈ç or komainu statues which are present on some levels. A grotesque handmaiden may also appear on some levels, and coming in contact with this handmaiden will prevent the player from moving for a short period of time. Though the player can still attack with the sickle in this condition, it becomes impossible to dodge enemy projectiles, making it very difficult to progress. The handmaiden character does not appear in the i-appli mobile phone version. A level is completed when the player picks up all eight gold koban coins which are spread throughout the map, or if they capture the daikan (Japanese feudal lord) that can randomly appear during the level. There are eight levels included in the original game, and the Famicom version contains four levels, with four more secret levels where the location of the coins is changed. The player returns to the first level after all eight levels are completed. Completing the cycle twice ends the game in the i-appli version, but the player can continue the game indefinitely in the Famicom version by choosing to ignore the coins and concentrate on fending off the enemies. The opening animation was not included and the number of levels was decreased to half the original number in the Famicom version. However, several new items were made available. The bamboo spear allows the player to attack by thrusting the spear forwards, but players cannot throw the sickle or attack in other directions during this time. This becomes a disadvantage against enemies that use projectiles, so it is advantageous to ignore the item on some levels. Eating a daikon (Japanese radish) increase the player's speed, and obtaining an emakimono (Japanese scroll) gives the player an additional life. The leaf item allows the player to duplicate and become invincible, but their attack power remains the same. The smoke item allows the player to advance to the bonus level after completing the current level. A senry≈çbako (Japanese treasure chest) appears in non-Famicom versions of the game, and the character's animated expression changes to laughter when it is obtained. However, the player cannot move while this animation lasts, making them very vulnerable to projectile attacks. Like the bamboo spear in the Famicom version, the treasure chest can actually hinder the player's progress. However, the bamboo spear awards the player bonus points when obtained, and the number of points gained by killing enemies increases while the player is in possession of the spear. Players can advance to the bonus level if they obtain an onigiri. In the Famicom version, the bonus level is accessed by obtaining the smoke item from the jiz≈ç statues. The bonus level is played by catching onigiri thrown in random trajectories by a sennin. The player gains bonus points for every onigiri that they manage to catch, and an extra life is awarded if the player successfully catches all 10 onigiri. However, the character's slow movement makes it difficult to catch all 10 onigiri unless the players cooperate in the multiplayer mode. In the mobile phone version, the narrower width of the game screen makes it easier for the player to catch all 10 onigiri, but the onigiri are thrown at a noticeably faster speed. This type of bonus game became a fixture for SunSoft products, and appears in other games like Dead Zone (1986) and Tenka no Goikenban: Mito K≈çmon (1987). The Famicom version consists of four different levels, with the fifth level being an alternate version of the first, the sixth being an alternate version of the second, and so on. The difficulty gradually increases as the game progresses, and the game levels loop infinitely. There is no ending screen for the game, and completion of level 99 brings the player to level 00, which is an alternate version of the fourth level. The player returns to level 01 after completing level 00. A \\"secret letter\\" appears on-screen after each of the first 8 levels in the Famicom version. The secret letters displayed are E, R, A, W, T, F, O, S, in order, and if the letters are read backwards as indicated in the game's instruction manual, they form the word \\"SOFTWARE.\\" This code word was required for the gift campaign that was conducted during the game's initial release. Reception Japanese essayist Jun Miura coined the term after playing the Famicom version of Ikki.„ÇØ„ÇΩ„Ç≤„ÉºÊé¢Ë®™ Regardless, the game still sold reasonably well and was one of Sunsoft's most popular products at the time. Game Machine listed Ikki on their August 15, 1985 issue as being the tenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy=Re- releases The game was re-released for Microsoft Windows as part of the Ultra2000 Sunsoft Classic games compilation, which was released on June 29, 2001. The game has also been coupled with T≈çkaid≈ç Goj≈´san-tsugi and Y≈´y≈´ Sunsoft kessaku-sen 2 (released July 2, 2004), and was coupled with Super Arabian for the PlayStation compilation Memorial Series Sunsoft Vol. 1. This compilation was also released for the PlayStation Network download service for the PlayStation 3, and also became available on Nintendo's Virtual Console on January 16, 2007, for the Wii,Japanese Sunsoft website catalog on February 13, 2013, for the Nintendo 3DS and on May 22, 2013, for the Wii U Ikki Mobile The mobile version of Ikki, titled was released by SunSoft in July, 2006, for the SoftBank Mobile and EZweb mobile phone networks. Though the content is identical to that of the previous versions, Ikki Mobile contains a series of minigames and a moe drawing trading card series, which can be purchased using the coins collected in the main game. The mobile version consists of 7 different levels, and several changes were made to the characters and graphics. The handmaiden character was revived from the i-appli version, and the bamboo spear has the added effect of deflecting enemy projectiles. The ghost enemy is no longer invincible, and the ninja and handmaiden change to kunoichi and princesses, respectively, as the game progresses. The four minigames become available after the player has completed the 7-level cycle at least once. The first is a slot machine game, where up to 3 coins can be bet at one time. The second is a concentration game that requires 10 coins to play. Up to 5 mistakes are allowed per game, and picking the lucky card gives the player 10 bonus coins. The third game is a frog derby game, where the player bets up to 10 coins on the winning frog. The last minigame is the onigiri catching game that was the bonus level in the Famicom version. It also requires 10 coins to play. Though the content is mostly the same, it is impossible to catch all 10 onigiri, as some are thrown off the borders of the game screen. Small and large gold coins are thrown in addition to the onigiri, and 5 onigiri count for 1 gold coin while 5 small gold coins count for 1 large gold coin. The gold coins collected during the game can also be used to buy packages of the in-game trading card series (capturing a feudal lord in the mobile version yields a bonus of 10 gold coins). Three random cards are included in each card package, and a set of card consists of 16 different cards. Each set of cards creates a single illustration, and the main game's difficulty increases every 48 cards collected. Completing two sets allows the player to access a special webpage from the title screen, where mobile wallpaper can be downloaded after a short survey.

It is refuge for the world's largest population of Great One-horned Rhinoceros. The park has many Elephant, Water Buffalo and Swamp Deer. It is recognized as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International for conservation of avifaunal species. The park has achieved notable progress in wildlife conservation despite several constraints. Kaziranga is a vast stretch of tall elephant grass, marshland and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests crisscrossed by four main rivers ‚Äî Brahmaputra, Diphlu, Mora Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri and has numerous small water bodies. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, documentaries and songs. The park celebrated its centenary in 2005 since its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.

A total addition of along the present boundary of the park has been made and notified with separate national park status to provide extended habitat for increasing population of wildlife or as a corridor for safe movement of animals to Karbi Anglong Hills. The southern border of the park is roughly defined by the Mora Diphlu river. Further south are the hills of Barail and the Mikir. The National Highway NH-37 was once the formal southern boundary of the park. The Brahmaputra River constitutes the dynamically changing Northern boundary of the park. The other rivers in Kaziranga are Diphlu, Mora Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri. Kaziranga is mostly flat expanses of fertile alluvial silt (part of the highly fertile Middle Brahmaputra alluvial flood plains), exposed sandbars, riverine flood-formed lakes called Beels (Beels make up as much as 5% of the surface area) and elevated flats called chapories where animals shelter during floods. Many artificial chapories have been built with the help of the Indian Army.Kaziranga National Park . WildPhotoToursIndia. Retrieved on 2007-02-27 The average altitude of the park ranges from to , with the Mikir Hills to the south of the park rising to around . Human habitation There are no villages within the boundary of the park. However the area outside the boundary of the park is very densely populated. There were 39 villages within a radius of the park, with an estimated population of 22,300 people in 1983-1984. According to a 2002 report, the figure has risen by 184 villages with about 50,000 households. A few new settlements have come up in recent times outside the park borders for servicing the booming eco-tourism industry. Geology A satellite image of the Kaziranga area showing the shifting waters of the Brahmaputra Asian elephants grazing Per the plate tectonics, Assam is in the easternmost projection of the Indian Plate, where it is thrusting underneath the Eurasian Plate creating a subduction zone. It is postulated that due to the northeasterly movement of the Indian plate, the sediment layers of an ancient geosyncline called Tethys (in between Indian and Eurasian Plates) have been pushed upward to form the Himalayas mountain range. Karbi Anglong plateau, which is situated to the south of the Kaziranga (along with the Khasi and Garo Hills) is originally part of the South Indian Plateau system. It is believed that due to the force exerted by the north-eastwardly movement of the Indian plate at the time of the Himalayan origin, a huge fault was created between the Rajmahal hills and the Karbi-Meghalaya plateau. Later, this depression was filled up by the depositional activity of numerous rivers. Today the Maghalaya and Karbi Anglong plateau remains detached from the main Peninsular block. Average height of this plateau varies from to . Kaziranga National Park's landscape is the creation of natural forces of silt deposition and erosion that has been effected by the river Brahmaputra over hundreds of years. This ongoing process of erosion and deposition becomes more severe during the floods which occur at regular intervals during the monsoon season. The Brahmaputra river in its flow through Assam receives more than a hundred tributaries flowing down from the adjoining hills. Once the tributaries hit the river valley, they lose their momentum; deposit the silt they carry, form ox-bow lakes and alluvial fans and branch out before picking up their courses again to join the Brahmaputra. Biomes Kaziranga is one of the largest tracts of protected land in the sub-Himalayan belt, and due to its high species diversity and presence of high-visibility species, has been described as a \\"biodiversity hotspot\\". The park is located in the Indomalayan realm, and the region falls in two ecoregions, the Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests of the Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, and a frequently flooded variant of the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands of the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome.

It was located on the Penn-Lincoln Parkway West (then PA 60) at McClaren Road, just 1¬Ω miles south of the old Greater Pittsburgh International Airport site.  History  The park opened in 1955 with seven rides. It was operated by brother and sister Roy Todd and Margaret Kleeman, who built it along with Kleeman's husband Edward. It occupied about and featured a kiddie park and 15 rides such as the Galaxi roller coaster, Merry-Go-Round, Sport Skooter, Scrambler, Ferris wheel, Tilt-A-Whirl, Mad Mouse roller coaster, Giant Slide, and train billed as \\"the longest train ride in the Tri-State.\\" White Swan also had a pavilion of midway games (which was the actual entrance to the park), six picnic shelters, a Skee Ball building, and a refreshment stand. On July 12, 1963, a new miniature golf course opened at the east end of the park. With construction of the new Pittsburgh International Airport underway in the late 1980s, a reroute of PA 60 (renumbered I-376 in 2009) was needed for access. After the park's 1989 season, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation bought the park. Dismantling of the park began the following year. The amusements and other artifacts were sold at auction. The Mad Mouse was moved to Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania, but was sold and removed in 2003. The Galaxi coaster was shipped to Lubbock, Texas. The last item from the park to be removed was the Giant Slide. The Tilt-a-Whirl is still in operation at Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, PA. The small park was appropriate primarily for families with young children, and was seen by many in its area as easier to visit on a whim than the larger Kennywood amusement park, which dominates the Pittsburgh market.

It is a closed karst basin with a wetland area and an agrarian area. The lake is an important stopover for migratory birds. The size of the lake varies, depending on the season. Usually this area around the lake is fairly dryerfoot. In certain weather conditions thousands of small green frogs hide in the damp grass from the aquatic snakes. These frogs are invisible in the grass until you almost step on them, at which they jump out of the way, usually landing on another frog which also jumps. The effect is of ripples of frogs travelling outwards with every step. The area is rich in birds, amphibians and plant life. Other wildlife, such as weasels, can also be seen. The area is also mentioned in Greek Mythology, due to the Stymphalian birds, which infested the Arcadian woods near the lake. Heracles' sixth labour was to exterminate them.

Overview  The pink line, mostly underground, links Pla√ßa Espanya, in Barcelona proper, with Sant Boi de Llobregat, through L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. It opened in 1912 as a narrow gauge train line (hence predating the first metro Line 3 by 12 years), and was known as S3 until 2003, hence the name of its suburban extended line (S33). It's also part of the Llobregat-Anoia and Metro del Baix Llobregat railway networks run by FGC, from which trains continue from Mol√≠ Nou-Ciutat Cooperativa onwards. There is also a freight-only branch line before Sant Boi station that connects to the Port of Barcelona.

Most of her fiction was written under the pseudonym \\"Jeanie Hering\\". Early life and education She was born Marion Jean Catherine Hamilton at Brodick on the Isle of Arran on 21 June 1846, the illegitimate daughter of William, 11th Duke of Hamilton and a local island beauty, Elizabeth Hamilton. The Duke owned Brodick Castle, where one of his regular summer visitors was a popular landscape painter George Hering, son of one of London's most successful bookbinders, Charles Hering, Sr. George and his wife Caroline had lost their only child at the age of six and the Duke suggested that they adopt Marion. Her mother was reluctant but was persuaded that her daughter would get a much better start to life with this wealthy and well- connected couple. They took her to London at around the age of four, returning to their house, Ormidale, on Arran in the summer months. In London she was known as Jeanie Hering, the name she later used for her children's books. After receiving a good schooling to the age of sixteen she spent two years at a finishing school in Westphalia in Germany. After returning to London, the family were travelling to Arran by train for the summer when they were fortunate survivors of a train crash that killed hundreds. Married life The Herings' house in St John's Wood was in the midst of a thriving artistic community and it was no surprise that on 10 August 1875 Jeanie married an artist, John Adams-Acton, one of England's top sculptors.Siobhan Peiffer, ‚ÄòActon, Marion Jean Catherine Adams- (1846‚Äì1928)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 22 July 2017 Shortly after their marriage the couple took a tour across Europe to India where they spent several months in Bombay. When they returned they settled in a house in Marylebone. When both of her adopted parents died Marian inherited Ormidale, which she always visited for some time in the summer. Around 1880 the couple moved to 14 Langford Place, St John's Wood; at that time the house was named \\"Sunnyside\\" and included the present numbers 12 and 16. During their time at Langford Place, Jeanie became a mother to seven children. The couple held numerous soir√©es and afternoon bazaars for friends and neighbours, and Sunnyside became a leading social centre for politicians and artists, including Sarah Bernhardt. John Adams-Acton was a close friend of William Ewart Gladstone, and Jeanie in 1884 organised a large charity event with Mrs Gladstone called \\"The Bee\\". By the 1890s Jeanie was socialising in the highest circles with kings, queens and prime ministers, and although she wrote plays, one of which was performed at the Strand Theatre, she wrote no more fiction. She was looking for a new challenge in her life when her husband came home one day and announced that some friends had just walked from London to Dorset. Enamoured with this idea, she decided that the summer trip to Arran should be made that year on foot. Her husband quite reasonably objected on the grounds that his friends were just a couple, whereas she had six children, the youngest not even a year old; and of course Arran was considerably further than Dorset. Unperturbed, she undertook the journey of in about 7 weeks, with the poor nurse Ellen having to push the young child in a perambulator. The story of the journey became her last book, being published in 1894 as Adventures of a Perambulator. In 1908 Adams-Acton incurred serious injuries when he was knocked over by a car; a lingering illness resulted in his death at Ormidale in 1910. He is commemorated by a memorial plaque at 14 Langford Place, unveiled on 19 July 1994.City of Westminster green plaques Later life All Jeanie's boys survived the war and she herself lived to the age of eighty-two, when she died in London on 11 October 1928; her body was removed to Brodick on Arran, where she was buried in a small churchyard.

The record was released on September 17, 2005 via ECM Records label. It was Johnson's first release on ECM since 1987. Saxophonist Joe Lovano, guitarist John Scofield and pianist Eliane Elias are amongst the players.  Reviews  The album's title has biographical significance. Marc Johnson first came to the attention of players and listeners around the world as the bassist of Bill Evans' last great piano trio, between 1978 and 1980. The title track of the album, \\"Shades of Jade,\\" was inspired by legendary Scott La Faro's \\"Jade Visions\\", first featured on Sunday at the Village Vanguard, in which he provided a lesson in how intensity can be focused in inward-looking music. On Shades of Jade you get a treat of engaging and sensual, lyrical and swinging music. It reaped praise far and wide. The New York Times enthused over the \\"luminescence\\" created by the close partnership between Elias and Johnson, while The Village Voice said the album was \\"shimmering\\" yet its \\"lusciousness has all sorts of tensile strength.\\" All About Jazz's critique John Kelman, in his review of Shades of Jade stated: \\"Some would argue that it's impossible to call a recording classic until sufficient time has passed to determine its true staying power. Still, one can say that a recording has the makings of a classic‚Äîespecially in its ability to be simultaneously of its time and timeless...\\" Mike Shanly in his review for JazzTimes wrote, \\"In fact, Elias could almost be the de facto leader of the session.\\" Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News noted \\"When you hear the gorgeous, summer-afternoon trance tune that gives the disc its title, you'll know how very much about beauty Johnson learned as the bassist for both Bill Evans and Stan Getz, once upon a time... A gorgeous disc.\\" BBC music critique Peter Marsh wrote: \\"...But it's the ballads (and especially Elias's poised, emotionally charged soloing) that stay in the memory long after the CD's finished. While this music might not change your world, it'll feel like a better place while you're listening to it. That can't be bad.\\" The Guardian reviewer awarded the album four stars.

The construction was started in 1893 and finished in 1897. The palace is surrounded by a park with ponds, fountains, and collections of rare plants. Since 1963 the palace has housed the Palanga Amber Museum and is surrounded by the Palanga Botanical Garden. History Tyszkiewicz family member, Feliks Tyszkiewicz, contacted famous German architect Franz Heinrich Schwechten to construct a new palace; their old estate was a wooden manor on the banks of RƒÖ≈æƒó River. The first stage of construction lasted until 1897, consisting of the terrace and main residence building. The two story building had regular form with an arched terrace, decorated with sculptures from France. Although mainly italian neo-Renaissance in style, it also has neoclassical and baroque elements. Because in 1907 his wife, Antonina, delivered a healthy baby boy (Stanislaw) after a worrisome pregnancy, Feliks commissioned a sculpture of the blessing Jesus for the front of the palace. While the creator of this sculpture is unclear, there is evidence it was made by Danish artist Bertel Thorvaldsen or his apprentice.Danutƒó Mukienƒó. Laiminanƒçiojo Kristaus skulpt≈´ra. Retrieved on 2007-04-03 In 1948 the religious sculpture was torn down under the instructions by the Lithuanian communist authorities. It was reconstructed based on surviving photographs in 1993. Almost a decade after the construction of the palace, the owners started to construct a chapel near by, also designed by Schwechten. The palace gardens were designed by √âdouard Fran√ßois Andr√©, French horticulturalist and landscape architect, and his son.

In 1916, an attempt at palace expansion was started, with Heinrich Schwechten being requested to prepare designs for expanding the upper floors and veranda, but these projects were never completed. During World War I, the palace was damaged in German bombardment.Siedlecka, Po≈ÇƒÖga i okolice, p. 82 After World War II, the palace was nationalized and suffered from neglect.

It is long and its basin covers an area of . Its name is the feminine form of the Croatian adjective meaning \\"good\\" but it is over simplistic folk etymology. The river name probably comes from the Celtic , meaning ‚Äòwater‚Äô, Illyrian Œ¥œÖŒ≤œÅŒπœÇ () ‚Äòdeep‚Äô or Old Slavonic d—äbr—å (, ) also ‚Äòdeep‚Äô or ‚Äòvalley‚Äô. Dobra rises in Gorski Kotar near Skrad and Ravna Gora, where it flows first to the north and then turns to the east. It flows past Vrbovsko, to the southeast into the city of Ogulin, where it becomes an underground stream. It takes a sharp northward turn and rises back to the surface north of Ogulin. It continues to the northeast, past the Le≈°ƒáe spa and a hydroelectric plant (built and in test operation ), running in parallel to the Kupa and Mre≈ænica, and finally flows into the Kupa north of Karlovac. The Dobra river is rich in ichthyofauna and ornithofauna. The Upper and Lower Dobra river are abundant with fish species: brown and rainbow trout, grayling, chub, barbel, bleak, carp, and tench, all in Upper Dobra, while the Lower Dobra is one of the rare Croatian rivers that has fish species such as sprout, pike, chub, pomfret, and barbel. \\"Rijeka Dobra - lipljanski dio\\", www.huchen- angler.com, 2012. North of Ogulin, near Gojak, the water of Dobra is harvested for the Gojak Hydroelectric Power Plant, a hydroelectric power plant built to utilize the rivers Dobra and Mre≈ænica. In 2010. the Le≈°ƒáe hydroelectric power plant started operating on the Lower Dobra section of the river. \\"Hydroelectric power plant Le≈°ƒáe\\", www.obnovljivi.com, 2010. Two motorway bridges have been built over the Dobra: the Dobra Bridge (A1) and the Dobra Bridge (A6). Upper Dobra or Ogulin Dobra Upper Dobra or Ogulin Dobra (Ogulinska Dobra in Croatian) is a typical torrential water with sudden and big changes in volume flow, while the average slope decline is 1.4%. A smaller river Kamaƒçnik flows into Dobra near Vrbovsko. Until 1957 Dobra was disappearing in ƒêula's pit, a huge pit in the center of Ogulin. The Upper Dobra river was diverted into the system of the Hydroelectric power plant Gojak some 1.5 km upstream of ƒêula's pit, and by doing that an artificial lake Bukovnik was created. From the dam down to ƒêula's pit the river bed is filled with water that is there only once in a while, whenever there's heavy rainfall which causes the river to overflow the dam. \\"Jezero Bukovnik\\" (\\"The Bukovnik lake\\"), www.ogulin.hr, 2012.

Both names are derived from an older name for the surrounding region, Eidyn. It is generally accepted that this name in turn derives ultimately from the Celtic Common Brittonic language.Williams 1972, p. 47; 64.Chadwick, p. 107.Dumville, p. 297. Eidyn Several medieval Welsh sources refer to Eidyn. Kenneth H. Jackson argued strongly that \\"Eidyn\\" referred exclusively to the location of modern Edinburgh,Jackson 1969, pp. 77-78. but others, such as Ifor Williams and Nora K. Chadwick, suggest it applied to the wider area as well. The name \\"Eidyn\\" may survive today in toponyms such as Edinburgh, Dunedin, and Carriden (from Caer Eidyn, from which the modern Welsh name for Edinburgh, Caeredin, is derived), located eighteen miles to the west. Present-day Edinburgh was the location of Din Eidyn, a dun or hillfort associated with the kingdom of the Gododdin.Gardens of the 'Gododdin' Craig Cessford Garden History, Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1994), pp. 114-115 The term Din Eidyn first appears in Y Gododdin, a poem that depicts events relating to the Battle of Catraeth, thought to have been fought circa 600. The oldest manuscript of Y Gododdin forms part of the Book of Aneirin, which dates to around 1265 but which possibly is a copy of a lost 9th-century original. Some scholars consider that the poem was composed soon after the battle and was preserved in oral tradition while others believe it originated in Wales at some time in the 9th to 11th centuries.Evans 1982, p. 17. The modern Scottish Gaelic name \\"D√πn √àideann\\" derives directly from the British Din Eidyn. The English form is similar, appending the element -burgh, from the Old English burh, also meaning \\"fort\\".Room, pp. 118‚Äì119. Some sources claim Edinburgh's name is derived from an Old English form such as Edwinesburh (Edwin's fort), in reference to Edwin, king of Deira and Bernicia in the 7th century.Blackie, Geographical Etymology: A Dictionary of Place-names Giving Their Derivations, 68. However, modern scholarship rejects this idea, since the form Eidyn predates Edwin.Gelling, Nicolaisen and Richards, pp. 88‚Äì89. Stuart Harris in his book The Place Names of Edinburgh declares the \\"Edwinesburh\\" form to be a \\"palpable fake\\" dating from King David I's time. Edinburgh's original royal charter granting royal burgh status is lost and the first documentary evidence of the medieval burgh is a royal charter, , by King David I granting a toft in to the Priory of Dunfermline. This suggests that the town came into official existence between 1018 (when King Malcolm II secured the Lothians from the Northumbrians) and 1124.Campbell, A. (January 1942). \\"Two Notes on the Norse Kingdoms in Northumbria\\". The English Historical Review, Vol. 57, No. 225, pp. 85-97 The founding charter of Holyrood Abbey refers to the recipients (in Latin) as \\"Ecclisie Sancte Crucis Edwinesburgensi\\", by the 1170s King William the Lion was using the name \\"Edenesburch\\" in a charter (again in Latin) confirming the 1124 grant of David I. Documents from the 14th century show the name to have settled into its current form; although other spellings (\\"Edynburgh\\" and \\"Edynburghe\\") appear, these are simply spelling variants of the current name. Other names Detail of the Hereford Mappa Mundi, Edinburgh is labelled on this T and O map of the British isles from c. 1300 Auld Reekie The city is affectionately nicknamed Auld Reekie, Scots for Old Smoky, for the views from the country of the smoke covered Old Town. Robert Chambers, who asserted that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of Charles II, attributed the name to a Fife laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. Athens of the North Some have called Edinburgh the Athens of the North for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the Castle Rock of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the Athenian Acropolis. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a port several miles away (respectively Leith and Piraeus). Although this arrangement is common in Southern Europe, it is rare in Northern Europe. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the Scottish Enlightenment, was a key influence in gaining the name. Such beacons as David Hume and Adam Smith shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the Union, some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later neoclassical architecture, particularly that of William Henry Playfair, and the National Monument. Tom Stoppard's character Archie, of Jumpers, said, perhaps playing on Reykjav√≠k meaning \\"smoky bay\\", that the \\"Reykjav√≠k of the South\\" would be more appropriate.Stoppard, Tom. Jumpers, Grove Press, 1972, p. 69. Dunedin Edinburgh has also been known as Dunedin, deriving from the Scottish Gaelic, D√πn √àideann. Dunedin, New Zealand, was originally called \\"New Edinburgh\\" and is still nicknamed the \\"Edinburgh of the South\\". Other nicknames The Scots poets Robert Burns and Robert Fergusson sometimes used the Latin form of the city's name, Edina, in their work. Ben Jonson described it as Britaine's other eye, and Sir Walter Scott referred to the city as yon Empress of the North.Marmion A Tale of Flodden Field by Walter Scott . Retrieved 17 April 2007. Other Scots dialect variants include Embra, or Embro\\"For Embro' wells are grutten dry\\" Elegy On the Year 1788, Robert Burns and Edinburrie.

Federal requirements can be found in the Federal Aviation Regulations. Most of the regulations concern the aircraft, pilot and rules of flight. However, 14 CFR Part 105,http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title14-vol2-part105.pdf \\"Parachute Operations\\" regulates when and where jumps may be made and designates the requirements for parachute equipment and packing. For example, 14 CFR Part 105 (subpart C) requires the person packing either the main chute or the reserve parachute to be a certificated rigger, which means he or she has taken an FAA-approved training course and has passed rigorous FAA testing. 14 CFR Part 105 is based on the assumption that any individual who chooses to skydive has assessed the dangers involved and assumes personal responsibility for his or her safety. The regulations in Part 105 are intended to assure the safety of those not involved in the sport, including persons and property on the surface and other users of the airspace. The skydiving community is encouraged to adopt good operating practices and programs to avoid further regulation by the FAA. Skydiving and accidents When a skydiver is involved in an accident, the first step by the FAA is to determine if any regulations were violated. An investigator will examine the circumstances and route of the flight; the certification of the pilot; the airworthiness of the aircraft; and will ensure that the parachutes were packed in accordance with the regulations. If the FAA does not find any evidence of regulatory violation, it will defer any further investigation of the accident to local law enforcement. The accident then becomes a law enforcement investigation, and the FAA has no further involvement. If the FAA determines one or more of the regulations were violated, it will launch a separate investigation into the areas under its regulatory control, which concern the aircraft, its pilot, mechanic, the location or timing of the jump, and the parachute rigging. Jump practices The drop zone is a designated landing area clear of obstacles, and is usually marked. Some drop zones are located beneath complex airspace, and jump organizers will have a Letter of Agreement with the appropriate FAA air traffic control facility to address site-specific issues and concerns. Each day, before jumping begins, the drop zone operator will determine the weather and consult the Winds Aloft Forecast. The jump pilot files a \\"Notification\\" of jumping, at least one hour before the first jump, with Air Traffic Control (ATC) as required by FAR 105, and may file a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). Skydiving operations with continuous activity may file a permanent Notification and NOTAM, which are often depicted on aeronautical charts. (NOTAMS help alert other pilots about the jump.) Since skydivers often freefall at a speed of 120 mph or more, their bodies can be extremely difficult to spot from other aircraft. It is the responsibility of all involved to watch and avoid each other. During jump operations, pilots follow procedures covered by the general operating and flight rules covered by 14 CFR Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, as well as Part 105, which is discussed on page 1. The pilot will contact FAA Air Traffic Control a few minutes before the jump, advising of the jump altitude and exit time. Air traffic will advise of any other aircraft or unsafe conditions in the area. From a typical jump altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet, it takes just over one minute for the skydiver to freefall to parachute opening altitudes of 4,000 to 2,000 feet above ground level (AGL). Once the jump pilot ensures all jumpers have exited, he or she advises Air Traffic Control and descends to the airport. Skydiving ends when the pilot advises air traffic control that all of the jumpers have landed.

Early life Slinker began studying martial arts at a young age and attained the rank of second dan black belt in judo and sixth dan in Y≈çsh≈´kai. He joined the United States Marine Corps at age 17 before attending the University of Tampa. He worked as a police officer for the Tampa Police Department for ten years. Slinker also taught Yoshukai Karate under Mike Foster, coaching his fighters in the Battle of Atlanta (1976) among others. He competed in 29 karate tournaments, of which he won 27. In 1971, he was named to the United States judo team. That year, he also won the Amateur Athletic Union Southeast heavyweight championship in judo. Career Slinker wrestled for International World Class Championship Wrestling, Mid-South Wrestling (later Universal Wrestling Federation), World Wrestling Council, Florida Championship Wrestling and the National Wrestling Alliance. At various times, he was managed by Woman or competed as part of Kevin Sullivan's Army of Darkness. While competing in Tennessee, he challenged Jerry Lawler for the Memphis version of the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship on April 10, 1978 but was unsuccessful. On May 4, 1979, he won his first championship belt by defeating David Schultz for the NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship, a title Schultz soon regained in a rematch. Slinker also competed as a tag team wrestler, teaming with Kendall Windham, Edward Leslie and Ron Bass. On December 25, 1978 at the NWA Mid-South Superdome Extravaganza, Slinker and Bass competed in a tournament to determine the new holders of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. They faced Andr√© the Giant and Dusty Rhodes but were defeated. Competing in a tag team with Sgt. Rock in 1990, Slinker also won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. They won the title on November 12, 1990 and held the belts until the title was abandoned. After retiring as a professional wrestler in the early 1990s, Slinker managed Ron Bass and Robert Fuller before becoming a promoter and booking agent in Florida. Meeting Rob Szatkowski, Slinker suggested he change his ring name to Rob Van Dam, a name he has used ever since. He also introduced Szatkowski to Japanese promoter Giant Baba and helped him find work in World Championship Wrestling. While working for the United States Wrestling Association, Slinker also helped train such wrestlers as Flex Kavana, who later gained fame as The Rock. Personal life Slinker had two children, David, Jr. and Dina. He also had a twin brother named Don, another brother named Bill, and a sister named Mary Jo. He also had a stepson, Dennis Knight, who has competed under the ring names Tex Slazenger, Phineas Godwinn, and Mideon. In 1979, Slinker appeared in Mr. No Legs, a kung fu movie. Throughout much of his life, Slinker struggled with addiction. He was arrested on multiple occasions, which led to charges of theft and conspiracy to deliver drugs. He died on March 28, 2008 of liver failure, brought on by a lifetime of alcoholism.

Peter attended St. John's School in Manlius, New York until schooling was interrupted by World War I and they enrolled in Isidore Newman School (then called Isidore Newman Manual Training School) in New Orleans. In 1918, the Andersons purchased a large wooded tract of coastal land in Ocean Springs. It was Annette's firm intention that all three of her sons become artists, and her husband's, that they learn to make a living from it. By 1924, a year after the family moved to Ocean Springs, Peter was experimenting with pottery, and in 1928, after training with Edmund deForest Curtis at the Conestoga Pottery (Wayne, Pennsylvania) and with Charles F.

It is made up of the Government of Catalonia and local administrations. It has been known as ATM √Ärea de Barcelona since 2003 to differentiate it from the other existing Catalan public transport authorities in the Girona, Camp de Tarragona and Lleida areas, which are also identified as ATM. , the ATM-managed public transport system comprises 50 different operating companies and serves 346 municipalities, accounting for a population of over 5.7 million. Created in 1997, the ATM has since developed an Integrated Fare System (, STI) based on concentric fare zones. There currently exist about 80 different types of multiple-time tickets or unlimited passes for use on the STI, all of which allow free-of-charge interchange between transport modes in a single trip. In 2012, it was announced that the ATM was planning to upgrade the current magnetic stripe-based technology used on the STI to a contactless smart card validation system known as T-Mobilitat, reducing all the existing ATM cards to one. Integrated Fare System The Integrated Fare System (, STI) is the fare zone-based ticketing system run by the ATM allowing unified public transport fare integration throughout the Barcelona metropolitan area and beyond. The STI consists of six concentric fare zones centered in Barcelona, numbered 1‚Äì6, which are further divided into sectors lettered A‚ÄìH. The overall system virtually reaches the entire province of Barcelona, as well as adjacent parts of the Girona and Tarragona provinces, serving a total number of 15 comarques (counties) and 346 municipalities, that is a population of over 5.7 million. Although the Bergued√† and Ripoll√®s comarques were incorporated in the STI on 1 January 2015, they do not appear on official maps because of their distinct operation. The STI uses magnetic stripe-based technology. A generic 2009 T-10 card valid for travelling within one fare zone. Almost all public transport services within the STI are fare-integrated, with the exceptions of tourist- oriented services such as the Aerob√∫s express bus to Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport, the Tramvia Blau or the Montserrat Rack Railway and its associated funiculars. All major railway systems in the Barcelona area are fare- integrated, including the Barcelona Metro, the Trambaix and Trambes√≤s light rail‚Äìtram systems, the Rodalies de Catalunya-operated Barcelona commuter rail service, as well as the entire Barcelona‚ÄìVall√®s and Llobegat‚ÄìAnoia lines. The metro and the light rail‚Äìtram systems are entirely within fare zone 1. Nevertheless, there are the following exceptions: * Barcelona Metro: the T-10 multiple-time ticket (see below) is not accepted at the stations serving Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport‚ÄîAirport T1 and Airport T2 stations on Barcelona Metro line 9 (L9 Sud). Nevertheless, the rest of fare-integrated cards are valid. * Rodalies de Catalunya: its Barcelona commuter rail service also uses its own fare zone system for use with its non-integrated tickets. Although its fare zones are almost identical to those of the STI, they differ at some locations such as at Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport, thus creating differences on the prices for the same trip. There are eight basic types of fare-integrated cards‚Äîthe T-10, T-50/30, T-70/30, T-Mes, T-Jove, T-Trimestre, T-Dia and T-16‚Äî, all of which are multiple-time tickets or unlimited passes allowing free-of- charge interchange between transport modes in 1 hour and 25 minutes within one fare zone (plus 15 minutes for each additional zone). Single tickets are not fare-integrated and thus they do not allow interchange between transport modes or operating companies. All fare-integrated cards are identified with letter T followed by a hyphen (\\"T-\\") before a distinct name. There currently exist about 80 types of fare-integrated cards, depending on the number of fare zones permitted to cross, their validity period as well as the existence of fare reductions. Non-personalised fare-integrated cards can be purchased at railway and bus stations, at tram stops, at customer service points of the integrated companies, at CaixaBank cash machines, as well as at newsagent's shops and a number of small shops. The eight basic fare-integrated cards have the following features: { \\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! Card !! No. of trips !! Validity time !! Personalised !! unsortable  Notes - !

Known as T-12 prior to 31 December 2016, when it was valid for children aged 4‚Äì12. } The regular fare-integrated cards are not valid in the Bergued√† and Ripoll√®s comarques due to the limitations of magnetic stripe- based technology. Dedicated multiple-time tickets can be purchased for use on trips between Bergued√† and Bages, Bergued√† and Barcelona, and Ripoll√®s and Barcelona. Fares on such trips are calculated as if these comarques formed an outer seventh fare zone. A T-10 multiple-time ticket for use within fare zone 1 is also included with the dedicated card. A one- or two-zone T-10 card can be used on trips within each of the comarques, though interchanges between transport modes are not permitted. The fares for each type of card are calculated according to the number of fare zones crossed. Regarding unlimited passes, the first fare zone in which the pass is validated will determine the number of fare zones permitted to cross with that pass. Since fares are updated on 1 January of each year, the multiple-time tickets purchased the previous year expire on 28‚Äì29 February (depending on the year), whilst unlimited passes expire on 31 March.

The term came into English usage during the Second Boer War of 1899-1902. History Boer Commando in action during the First Boer War, 1881 In 1658, war erupted between the Dutch settlers at Cape Colony and the Khoi-khoi. In order to protect the settlement, all able bodied men were conscripted. After the conclusion of this war, all men in the colony were liable for military service and were expected to be ready on short notice. By 1700, the size of the colony had increased immensely and it was divided into districts. The small military garrison stationed at the Castle de Goede Hoop could not be counted on to react swiftly in the border districts, therefore the commando system was expanded and formalized. Each district had a Kommandant who was charged with calling up all burghers in times of need. In 1795, with the First British Occupation and again in 1806 with the Second British Occupation, the commandos were called up to defend the Cape Colony. At the Battle of Blaauwberg (6 January 1806), the Swellendam Commando held the British off long enough for the rest of the Batavian army to retreat to safety. Under British rule, the Cape Colony continued to use the commando system in its frontier wars, in addition to regular British imperial troops. Boer commandos fought alongside Fengu, British settlers, Khoi-khoi and other ethnic groups in units which were often mixed. Light, mobile commandos were undeniably better-suited than the slow-moving columns of imperial troops, for warfare in the rough frontier mountains. However, tensions often arose in the Cape's government over the relative merits and control of these two parallel military systems.RD staff (1996). Xhosa Wars. Reader's Digest Family Encyclopedia of World History. The Reader's Digest Association. During the Great Trek, this system was used and remained in use in the Boer republics. Both republics issued commando laws, making commando service mandatory in times of need for all male citizens between the ages of 16 and 60. During the Anglo-Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) the Boer commando formed the backbone of the Boer forces. After the declaration of peace in 1902, the commandos were disbanded. They did re-form themselves in clandestine \\"shooting clubs\\". In 1912, the commandos were re-formed as an Active Citizen Force in the Union Defence Force. This system was in operation until 2005, when all commandos were disbanded again. Structure The Commando assembled from Pretoria in 1899 Boer Commando with captured British prisoners during the Anglo-Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) Each commando was attached to a town, after which it was named (e.g. Bloemfontein Commando). Each town was responsible for a district, divided into wards. The commando was commanded by a kommandant and each ward by a veldkornet or field cornet (equivalent of a senior NCO rank) The veldkornet was responsible not only for calling up the burghers, but also for policing his ward, collecting taxes, issuing firearms and other materiel in times of war. Theoretically, a ward was divided into corporalships. A corporalship was usually made up of about 20 burghers. Sometimes entire families (fathers, sons, uncles, cousins) filled a corporalship. The veldkornet was responsible to the kommandant, who in turn was responsible to a general. In theory, a general was responsible for four commandos. He in turn was responsible to the commander-in-chief of the republic. In the Transvaal, the C-in-C was called the Commandant-General and in the Free State the Hoofdkommandant (Chief Commandant). The C-in-C was responsible to the president. Other auxiliary ranks were created in war time, such as vleiskorporaal (\\"meat corporal\\"), responsible for issuing rations. The commando was made up of volunteers, all officers were appointed by the members of the commando, and not by the government. This gave a chance for some commanders to appear, such as General Koos de la Rey and General C. R. de Wet, but also had the disadvantage of sometimes putting inept commanders in charge. Discipline was also a problem, as there was no real way of enforcing it. The various Boer republics did not all have the same command structure.Angloboerwar website Weaponry Before the Second Boer War, the republics' most popular rifle was the .450 Westley Richards, a falling-block, single-action, breech-loading model, with accuracy up to 600 yards.

Its geographic range is larger than that of any other slow loris species. Considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris (N. coucang) until 2001, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Bengal slow loris is most closely related to the Sunda slow loris. However, some individuals in both species have mitochondrial DNA sequences that resemble those of the other species, due to introgressive hybridization. It is the largest species of slow loris, measuring from head to tail and weighing between . Like other slow lorises, it has a wet nose (rhinarium), a round head, flat face, large eyes, small ears, a vestigial tail, and dense, woolly fur. The toxin it secretes from its brachial gland (a scent gland in its arm) differs chemically from that of other slow loris species and may be used to communicate information about sex, age, health, and social status. The Bengal slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, occurring in both evergreen and deciduous forests. It prefers rainforests with dense canopies, and its presence in its native habitat indicates a healthy ecosystem. It is a seed disperser and pollinator, as well as a prey item for carnivores. Its diet primarily consists of fruit, but also includes insects, tree gum, snails, and small vertebrates. In winter, it relies on plant exudates, such as sap and tree gum. The species lives in small family groups, marks its territory with urine, and sleeps during the day by curling up in dense vegetation or in tree holes. It is a seasonal breeder, reproducing once every 12‚Äì18 months and usually giving birth to a single offspring. For the first three months, mothers carry their offspring, which reach sexual maturity at around 20 months. The Bengal slow loris can live up to 20 years. The species is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, and is threatened with extinction due to growing demand in the exotic pet trade and traditional medicine. It is one of the most common animals sold in local animal markets. In traditional medicine, it is primarily used by wealthy to middle-class, urban women following childbirth, but also to treat stomach problems, broken bones, and sexually transmitted diseases. It is also hunted for food and suffers from habitat loss. Wild populations have declined severely, and it is locally extinct in several regions. It is found within many protected areas throughout its range, but this does not protect them from rampant poaching and illegal logging. Critical conservation issues for this species include enhancing protection measures, stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws, and increased connectivity between fragmented protected areas. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Bengal slow loris was long considered a subspecies until it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001. Nycticebus bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal slow loris or northern slow loris, is a strepsirrhine primate in the slow loris genus, Nycticebus. Formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris (N. coucang), it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 by taxonomist and primatologist Colin Groves. It is difficult to distinguish from the other species in its genus. To help clarify species and subspecies boundaries, and to establish whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including N. pygmaeus, N. menagensis and N. javanicus) were shown to be genetically distinct‚Äîthe analysis suggested that DNA sequences from some individuals of N. coucang and N. bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with members of their own species. The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N. coucang individuals was not known. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N. bengalensis and N. coucang, and suggested that there has been gene flow between the two species. Anatomy and physiology The Bengal slow loris has large eyes, round head, and short ears, as shown in this illustration from the mid-19th century. The Bengal slow loris is the largest species of slow loris, weighing , and measuring between from head to tail. It has a skull length of more than . It has dense, woolly, brown-gray fur on its back and white fur on its underside. It also has a clear dark stripe that runs up to the top of its head, but does not extend laterally towards the ears. Its forearm and hand are almost white. The limbs of the pelvis vary in color from brown to nearly white, and the feet are always pale. Moulting may cause seasonal variations in the color of the dorsal surface. Like other slow lorises, its tail is vestigial and it has a round head and short ears. It has a rhinarium (the moist, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose) and a broad, flat face with large eyes. Its eyes reflect a bright orange eye shine. On its front feet, the second digit is smaller than the rest; the big toe on its hind foot opposes the other toes, which enhances its gripping power. Its second toe on the hindfoot has a curved \\"toilet-claw\\" that the animal uses for scratching and grooming, while the other nails are straight. In addition to being smaller than the Bengal slow loris, the sympatric Sunda slow loris also differs in its coloring: it does not have the pale areas of the head, nape and shoulders, and its overall color is a tawny- or golden-brown. The pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus) is much smaller, with a skull length less than . It also lacks the dark dorsal stripe of the Bengal slow loris, has dark brown fur, and longer ears. The Bengal slow loris has a small swelling on the ventral side of its elbow called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and it has been shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi- volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris. The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex, age, health and nutritional status, and dominance. Behavior and ecology The Bengal slow loris will gouge the bark of the bastard myrobala tree to obtain exudates, an important food source‚Äîespecially in winter seasons. The preferred habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, and include evergreen and semi- evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies. It can also be found in bamboo groves. It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip to the base of the crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health. The species acts as an important seed disperser and pollinator, as well as a prey item for several carnivores. The Bengal slow loris feeds on plant exudates such as sap, gums, resins, and latexes, particularly those from the family Fabaceae. Even though the species does not have keeled nails, it will scrape the plant, actively breaking its surface; this behavior resembles that of marmosets and the fork-marked lemurs. Exudates are also obtained by gouging holes in the bark. The winter food supply consists almost entirely of plant exudates. The bastard myrobala (Terminalia belerica), a deciduous tree common in Southeast Asia, is a preferred source for exudates, but it has also been observed taking plant exudates from a number of families: Moraceae (Artocarpus), Magnoliaceae (Manglietia), Fabaceae (Acacia, Bauhinia), Lecythidaceae (Careya arborea), and Sterculiaceae (Pterospermum). Although it will feed on large insects (such as katydids and crickets), gum, snails, small birds, and reptiles, it is primarily frugivorous. Lianas of the flowering plant genus Bauhinia are a commonly used food source. A nocturnal animal, the Bengal slow loris has excellent night vision, enhanced by a tapetum lucidum‚Äîa layer of tissue in the eye that reflects visible light back through the retina. It sleeps during the day curled up in a ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes. Males and females mark their territory with urine. The species is known to live in small family groups. Animals may practice social grooming. Reproduction The Bengal slow loris is not a seasonal breeder, unlike the pygmy slow loris. Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle. Females reproduce every 12‚Äì18 months and have a six-month gestation. Because they are not seasonal breeders, females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old, making possible for females to produce two offspring per year. Females typically give birth to a single offspring, although twins rarely occur. This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow loris, which commonly has twins. The mother carries her young about three months before they become independent, although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20 months of age. The species is known to live up to 20 years. Distribution The species has the largest geographic range of all slow loris species and is native to Northeast India, Bangladesh and Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Vietnam, southern China and Thailand). It is the only nocturnal primate found in the northeast Indian states, which include Assam, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura. It is found in parts of Yunnan and in southwest Guangxi in China, and has been recorded in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. It is known from 24 protected areas in Vietnam, and is distributed across most of Thailand. In Burma, it has been reported from Bhamo, Sumprabum, Kindat, Chin Hills, Pathein, Thaungdaung and Pegu; populations in Laos have been recorded in the north, central, and southern portions of the country. The Bengal slow loris is sympatric (shares its range) with the pygmy slow loris in the southeast of China, Vietnam, and Laos. The Bengal slow loris is also sympatric with the Sunda slow loris on the southern peninsula of Thailand. In 2001, Groves reported the existence of hybrids between these two species in this region. Conservation Listed as \\"Data Deficient\\" as recently as 2006 on the IUCN Red List, The Bengal slow loris was evaluated in 2020 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as endangered-a decision based solely on habitat loss due to lack of sufficient field data. It is found within numerous protected areas within its range; however, poaching and illegal logging are rampant while conservation measures are not species-specific. The species can be found in at least 43 protected areas in Northeast India, 14 conservation areas in Laos, and 24 protected areas in Vietnam. It can be found at Lawachara National Park in Bangladesh, and 80% of its range in China is protected. The species has been listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and in June 2007, it was transferred along with all other slow loris species to CITES Appendix I, which forbids international commercial trade. The most severe threats facing the species are the wildlife trade (trapping for exotic pets and use in traditional medicine) and deforestation. Slash and burn agriculture has also resulted in the destruction of its habitat, and road construction is another factor in its decline. Hunting has been found to be most severe when nearby urban human populations increase. Enhancing protection measures, enforcing current wildlife protection laws, and improving the connectivity between protected areas are factors considered critical to ensure the survival of this species. The species is commonly sold as a pet and to zoos throughout Southeast Asia. In Cambodia, it was reported in 2006 as one of the most common mammals found in shops and stalls, found in the hundreds and selling for US$0.85 to US$6.25. In the same year, it was found selling for US$2.50 to US$6.30 at bazaars in China (Mengla County in Yunnan Province) and US$70 in Thailand. The Bengal slow loris is used in traditional medicine in all of these countries, selling for US$15 in Vietnam, and is also eaten in Vietnam. The animal is predominantly used to prepare treatments for women after childbirth, stomach problems, healing wounds and broken bones, and in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Primary users are wealthy to middle-class women in urban areas. Habitat and population trends Throughout its geographic range, slow lorises are in serious decline. Their habitat has been seriously degraded, and growing human populations will add increasing pressure. In countries like Bangladesh, only 9% of the original forest cover was still present in 2000. In northeastern Cambodia, forests are being cleared at an increasing rate, with a loss of 6% of the natural forest between 1999 and 2000. Within those same years, Myanmar and Thailand lost 14% and 26% of their natural forest, respectively. In Vietnam, only 30% of the original forest cover remains due to the deforestation caused by the Vietnam War, and only 10% of that includes closed-canopy forests. Habitat destruction remains rampant, and all slow loris populations within its borders are significantly depleted. Populations have been declared locally extinct in southern Qu·∫£ng Nam Province and parts of the highlands, and the same is expected in Song Thanh and Kon Cha Rang nature reserves. In India, dense forest canopy has been depleted by as much as 55% in some areas and is rapidly disappearing. As early as 1987, the Indo-China region had reportedly lost 75% of the natural habitat for slow lorises. In 1992, the population size was estimated between 16,000 and 17,000 individuals, based on available habitat; however, recent publications report that few individuals remain due to a reduced geographic range. The Bengal slow loris may be restricted to a few isolated populations and is in serious threat of becoming locally extinct in parts of Assam and Meghalaya. In Arunachal Pradesh, its population is declining and under threat. Population density has been estimated between 0.03 and 0.33 individuals per km2 in Assam, India according to a study published in 2006. A survey in 2007 at the Thrisna Wildlife Sanctuary and Sipahijola Wildlife Sanctuary in Tripura, India yielded an encounter rate of 0.22 individuals/km, with seven of nine sightings occurring within and most of the animals found at a height of and near the interior of wet, deciduous forest. In 2008, the species abundance was measured at 0.18 individuals/km at Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam. Since the 1990s, China's forests have declined significantly. In Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, primary forests are few and isolated, and secondary forests have been severely degraded. Yunnan has lost 42% of its forests and 2,000 or less slow lorises remain. In Guangxi, the Bengal slow loris is nearly extinct; it has been extirpated in Ningming County and only a few individuals are left in Jingxi, Longzhou and Pingxiang.

Hunt believed the fire to be a pious fraud which brought Christianity into disrepute. He intended the painting to be a satire in the manner of William Hogarth. Hunt published an elaborate keyplate explaining the identity of the various characters depicted. It is exhibited in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Subject The miracle of the Holy Fire is an annual event in which the patriarch of the Greek Orthodox church in Jerusalem enters the shrine of the Holy Sepulchre with an unlit lamp and emerges with it lit. The ceremony begins at noon when the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem or another Orthodox Archbishop recites a specific prayer. The congregants will then chant \\"Lord, have mercy\\" (Kyrie eleison in Greek) until the Holy Fire \\"descends\\" on a lamp of olive oil held by the patriarch while he is alone in the tomb chamber. The patriarch will then reveal himself from the tomb chamber and recite some prayers and light either 33 or 12 candles and distribute them to the congregants. Hunt depicts the moment at which the kindled fire is released from the chamber and passed from candle to candle. Lighted candles can be seen emerging from the shrine in the background at the right. Hunt does not concentrate on the event itself, but rather on the social and ethnographic context in which it occurs. Meaning Along with other Protestants and Catholics, Hunt had no doubt that the fire was not a miracle, so he concentrates on what he considered to be the fanatical and grotesque responses of the participants. He also believed that the interior of the church was the epitome of bad taste, writing that it was \\"crammed full of trumpery pictures of old Saints, and decorated throughout in that bad taste which Roman Catholics have to themselves in Europe but which here the modern Greeks share with them.\\"Bronkhurst, J., William Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonn√©, vol 1, p.278 Hunt depicted the various competing religious groups along with the different races and ethnicities of the region.

Like other forms of motorized boating, internal drive propulsion employs a motor that turns a propeller to move the boat forward. The primary difference between internal drive boats and stern drive boats is that the propeller is enclosed inside the hull of an internal drive boat whereas the propeller is exposed outside the hull of a stern drive boat. A conventional screw propeller accelerates a large volume of water by a small amount, similar to the way an airplane propeller accelerates a large volume of air by a small amount. An aircraft's jet engine, by contrast, accelerates a small volume of air by a large amount. Both methods yield thrust due to Newton's third law ‚Äî every force gives rise to an equal and opposite force. In an internal drive boat, pumping a small volume of water and accelerating it by a large amount delivers the thrust. The acceleration of the water is achieved by using multiple impeller stages. Steering is accomplished by small vanes that direct the water jet. Internal drive propulsion was originally designed by Sir William Hamilton (who invented the waterjet in 1954) for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand, specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters. Primary benefits: * Water skiers, wakeboarders, swimmers, divers, etc. are not exposed to external propellers. * Less potential for damage to internal drive boats from floating debris. * Less potential for major drive damage from running aground as with exposed propellers. * Better maneuverability and acceleration compared to stern-drive counterparts.

Early and personal life Born in Truro, Cornwall, but raised in Nairn, Nelson was educated at Nairn Academy and Dollar Academy. He went on to study history and politics at the University of Glasgow and gained a diploma in journalism at City University. He is Catholic, and he once worked as a barman at Cleos in Rosyth. Married with two sons and a daughter, the family live in Twickenham. He is married to Linda, a Swede, and says \\"I am a soppy Europhile who speaks a second language at home. The idea of a united Europe was one that really excited me when I was younger, and which I love now.\\" Journalism career Nelson began his journalistic career as a business reporter with The Times in 1997, followed by a short spell as Scottish political correspondent. At a party he met Andrew Neil, then editor of The Scotsman who recruited him as its political editor in 2001. In 2003 he moved to The Business, a sister title of The Scotsman in the Barclay brothers' Press Holdings group. In July 2004 the brothers bought The Telegraph Group, which included The Spectator and in December 2005 they sold The Scotsman Publications Ltd. Neil had been appointed Chief Executive of The Spectator after the Barclays bought it, and in 2006 he brought in Nelson as associate editor and then political editor of the magazine. He replaced Matthew d'Ancona as editor of The Spectator when the latter left in August 2009. Under his editorship, the magazine has reached a record high in print circulation. In addition to his role as editor of The Spectator, Nelson was a political columnist for the News of the World from 2006 and a board director with the Centre for Policy Studies think tank.Fraser Nelson profile Centre for Policy Studies He was named Political Columnist of the Year in the 2009 Comment Awards. In 2013, the Evening Standard named Nelson as one of the most influential journalists working in London. The British Society of Magazine Editors awarded Nelson the 2013 Editors' Editor of the Year. In the same year he won the British Press Award as Political journalist of the Year. Style and beliefs Nelson is a supporter of the Conservative Party. He describes The Spectator magazine under his editorship as \\"right of centre, but not strongly right of centre\\". He on occasion criticised David Cameron's leadership but was generally supportive, and has also been known to praise Cameron's Liberal Democrat coalition partner from 2010 to 2015, Nick Clegg. In May 2018 he was heavily criticised for publishing a defense of German troops by Taki titled \\"In praise of the Wehrmacht\\" which said readers should feel sorry for Wehrmacht soldiers at Normandy.https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/spectator-editor-fraser-nelson-claims- power-of-editors-comically-overstated-in-500th-issue-under-his- editorship/https://www.timesofisrael.com/respected-british-magazine-publishes- defense-of-nazi-german- troops/https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2019/11/rod-liddles-latest- column-shows-just-how-low-spectator-will-go-attention Immigration Nelson has stated that he is a supporter of immigration. On 4 April 2014, Nelson published a piece in the Daily Telegraph entitled \\"The British Muslim is truly one among us ‚Äì and proud to be so\\", which praised the integration of mainstream Islam in the UK and described it as one \\"of our great success stories\\". He returned to the theme in May 2015, with an article entitled \\"The unsayable truth about immigration: it's been a stunning success for Britain\\". * \\"The irony is that Britain does not need legislation to make it more liberal.

Feyer was born Gy√∂rgy Fej√©r, but westernised his name after leaving Europe. (Feher means 'white' in Hungarian, and \\"Fej√©r is thus the equivalent of the antiquated spelling of the English name \\"Whyte\\".) Life=Early life and career in Europe Feyer remembered as a young boy hating his piano practice so much that his mother, a piano teacher, had to tie his legs to the piano stool. He studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest [alongside conductor Sir Georg Solti], and at the Budapest Conservatory of Music. Among his teachers were Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and B√©la Bart√≥k. By this time he was developing an interest in light music and was playing in the evenings in many of the bo√Ætes around Budapest, such as the Cafe Dunacorso where he accompanied Zsuzsa Darvas, a popular diseuse. Feyer graduated, aged 23, in 1932 and caused a minor scandal by turning to pop music full-time. It is ironic that he became a pianist after having been a student of composition and conducting, whereas his classmate Georg Solti, a piano prodigy, became one of the world's most acclaimed conductors. One of Feyer's first jobs was accompanying silent films, but he soon moved to night clubs, and it was not long before he and his drummer began working around Europe. His first trip away from Budapest was in 1934, to Barcelona, Spain. For the next five years he toured Europe. In Paris a great fan was the exiled Duke of Windsor (previously Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, who had abdicated the throne of England in December 1936, and who lived in France from 1937 to 1939). The Duke particularly liked the accordion, so Feyer and his drummer drew straws to decide which of them would have to learn to play it. The drummer lost, and Feyer was able to continue playing the piano. In 1939 Feyer returned to Hungary to be with his family, but was moved to German factories in a forced labour brigade. He was imprisoned in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in the last year of the war, from where he was rescued in 1945 by the Allies. Feyer returned to Budapest, and in late 1945 married Judith Hoffman, whom he had met during the war. The couple had a son (Robert, b. Budapest, November 1946), and Feyer continued his musical career, playing in the Allied Officers' Club in Budapest (there was four-power nominal occupation in all the former Axis powers, although in Eastern Europe the bulk of the troops were Soviet). After the establishment of Russian Stalinist Communist rule, Feyer fled to Switzerland in January 1948, where he had found a job playing at a resort hotel. He persuaded the owners to allow him to bring his family. At the time he played in a duo with a drummer, whose wife came too. By the time the original contract was fulfilled, the Iron Curtain had truly dropped and Feyer and his drummer (also named George) decided not to return to Hungary, fearing persecution based on their contact with Western powers. They stayed in Switzerland, gaining popularity through successive jobs at the big hotels. By 1950, when Hungary revolted, Switzerland would not allow them to become permanent residents on old Hungarian passports. Career in New York City Feyer‚Äôs younger brother Paul had left Europe before the war, and went to Venezuela. While there Paul won a lottery, and used the money to come to New York City, where he settled with the existing Hungarian community. He quickly married a young woman from within that community, and thereby got permanent U.S. residency and later citizenship. Feyer's father had died during the war, probably of alcoholism, and Paul had brought their mother to the U.S. in 1947. Having two immediate family members in the U.S. helped George Feyer to obtain a visa. (Feyer's mother lived for another forty years in New York, dying at the age of 102, in 1987.) The family arrived and settled in New York in January, 1951, changing the spelling of the name to Feyer almost immediately, as his brother Paul had done, to make it easier to pronounce, and to get work. George's family became U.S. citizens in 1956 after the requisite five-year waiting period. Feyer lived there for the rest of his life. (Feyer's drummer and his wife were also able to come to the United States, but they did not continue to work together in New York.) Within a few months of arrival he made his New York debut at the famous Gogi's La Rue, in The Plush Room. From 1951 to 1954 Feyer had a regular spot in Park Avenue's Delmonico Hotel [now known as Trump Park Avenue]. It was during this period that Feyer began his recording career, making his first record Echoes of Paris in 1953. (Although Feyer made his recordings with light accompaniment, all his hotel and nightclub shows were solo.) A handful more such records appeared in the next couple of years, and in 1955 Feyer signed a contract with New York's luxurious boutique hotel The Carlyle to appear in their Caf√© Carlyle. He performed there for 13 years in a room specially set up for him, with decor provided by a Hungarian interior designer. In August 1968, when he took his usual vacation on Nantucket Island, Bobby Short was hired to cover for him. In Short's words, \\"He took off two weeks that summer, and Peter Sharp, who owns The Carlyle, asked Ahmet and Nesuhi Erteg√ºn, of Atlantic Records, who to get as a replacement. They said, ‚ÄòGet Bobby Short.‚Äô I did my best to make those two weeks as successful as anything I‚Äôd done, and when Feyer‚Äôs contract ran out they offered me half a year. Feyer found a better deal elsewhere, and I work there now eight months of the year.\\" The management had changed, and the move turned out to be permanent. Short was to remain at The Carlyle for a fabled uninterrupted run until 2004, the year before his death. Feyer joked that he had \\"taken the most expensive vacation of them all,\\" and his son later said that he never set foot in The Carlyle again. However he soon found work in the Stanhope Hotel's Rembrandt Room. Feyer remained there for 12 years, until 1980. He spent his remaining two years of active performing at the Hideaway Room in the Waldorf-Astoria, another famous hotel in New York. Feyer retired in December 1982, after the death of his wife. In 1985 he remarried the former Marta Kleyman (a cousin of his brother Paul's first wife), and continued to appear at private parties and occasional hotel engagements, mostly as favours to friends, particularly in Palm Springs, California, where his second wife owned a home. For many years, until no longer physically able to do so (in 1999), he played weekly at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where he had been volunteering since 1961. Feyer died just six days before his 93rd birthday, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan's Upper East Side. He was survived by his son (who lives in San Francisco), three grandsons, and second wife (who died within the year after he died). The Department of Music at Princeton University dedicated a \\"George and Judith Feyer Practice Room\\" to their memory on 2 June 2003. Recordings From 1953 to 1956, Feyer released a series of LPs on the VOX record label. The records were all similarly entitled Echoes of .... The first, Echoes of Paris, was a huge hit, leading to 12 others. The music consisted of popular songs and melodies, played by Feyer on the piano in his own inimitable arrangements, with light guitar and rhythm accompaniment. In 1957 Feyer released his only two records with orchestra: one each of the songs of Cole Porter and Jerome Kern. From 1958 to 1959 Feyer recorded four albums for RCA Victor, and in 1960 he recorded his first live album An Evening At The Caf√© Carlyle, for Cadence Records. From the early 1960s onwards Feyer recorded a series of albums [including a second live album] for Decca, who also reissued three of his VOX records. In 1969 Feyer recorded an LP for Kapp Records. Sometime after 1970 he recorded his third live album, At The Stanhope, which was available only from The Stanhope itself. Feyer's final three recordings were for Vanguard Records: The Essential George Gershwin (1974), The Essential Cole Porter (1976), and The Essential Jerome Kern (1978). These three double-albums are the only of Feyer's recordings subsequently to have been officially issued on CD. However the issue of the Jerome Kern CD is missing the six tracks from the original LP which had contained an integral cello part throughout. In addition, various other tracks on the original LP had contained briefer cello parts, and these sections of those tracks were also all cut from the CD issue. The cello player was Evangeline Benedetti, a cellist with the New York Philharmonic since 1967. She has said that she knows nothing about why her parts were comprehensively edited out of the CD issue of the recording. In literature The 10-inch release of Feyer's first record, Echoes of Paris, is mentioned in Chapter 5 of Ian Fleming's fourth James Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever (published 1956).

As a young researcher he followed the path of his father: Professor Asen I. Hadjiolov was a well-known Bulgarian histologist and cytologist. Hadjiolov began experimental work in the Department of Biochemistry of the Medical Faculty of Sofia and was awarded the PhD in 1958 for his studies on the role of nucleic acids in cancer. In 1963 Hadjiolov became chair of the Department of Molecular Genetics in the Central Laboratory of Biochemistry, which was transformed into the Institute of Molecular Biology of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 1969. During his early years, Hadjiolov had the chance to work with such eminent scientists as F.B.

Early on, he became fascinated by the structure and biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes. Mechanisms of regulation of rRNA synthesis One of Hadjiolov's lab where rRNA was sequenced Hadjiolov's laboratory was the first to provide reliable evidence that the change in the rate of rRNA synthesis in higher eukaryotes is not accompanied by alterations in the number of active genes.Hadjiolov and Nikolaev (1976) Prog Biophys Mol Biol. 1976;31(2):95-144 During his active research years Hadjiolov published more than hundred of articles focused on the ribosome (see PubMed for a complete list).

The fourth game in the Sherlock Holmes series, it was released in October 2007 and is published by Focus Home Interactive. It was preceded in 2002 by Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Mummy, in 2004 by Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Silver Earring and in 2007 by Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. Plot In July 1895, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson receive a letter from the legendary French gentleman thief Ars√®ne Lupin. Lupin threatens to steal five of England's most prized treasures in hopes to humble the \\"vanity\\" of the English, and leaves a riddle containing information on what his first crime will be. Holmes and Watson determine that the theft will take place at the National Gallery, and upon arriving there deduce that the object will be The Fighting Temeraire, which is symbolic of Britain's victory over France and Spain in the Battle of Trafalgar. They alert the Museum Director and Inspector Lestrade who has the Gallery guarded at every entrance. However, the next the morning, they find the guards knocked out and the painting stolen. Holmes learns that Lupin disguised himself as a visiting French painter named Horace Velmont, and hid himself before Lestrade arrived. Lupin leaves behind a letter with a clue as to where he will strike next. The British Museum as it appears in the game Holmes and Watson head to the Tower of London, were they believe Lupin will steal the ravens. They arrived too late, as the ravens are reported missing and replaced with other individual birds and a bat which have been let lose. They capture the animals and find pieces of paper attached to them. From the messages in the papers, Holmes deduces what Lupin will do next. Holmes and Watson meet with Lestrade and the Prime Minister at the British Museum where Holmes informs then that Lupin intends to steal the Rosetta Stone, which was taken by Britain from the French. Lestrade once again has the Museum guarded at every entrance but Lupin still manages to steal the stone right in front of them using ropes. He leaves behind yet another letter. Holmes determines that someone had unwittingly helped Lupin pass the security system. Unknown to him, Watson had befriended a journalist named Piers Urquhart Alenn who he helped into the museum to pay him back for favors. Watson soon confesses and Holmes deduces, to his horror, that Lupin's next target will be Queen Victoria herself. At Buckingham Palace, Holmes and Watson find that the Prime Minister has had the place guarded heavily. Holmes learns that a French grandfather clock (which has a cupboard) was delivered to the queen's chamber and correctly deduces that Lupin made it to the queen. Lupin, however, does not hurt the queen but asks for a kiss which she obliges. She then allows him to use her secret corridor to escape. Holmes persuades Lupin but only manages to find another letter which clues to his next and final crime. The Prime Minister congratulates Holmes and Watson for their role in protecting the Queen and asks Watson to decipher Lupin's message. Watson initially deduces that the next crime will be at the Tower of London but the Prime Minister reminds him that Lupin already struck there. Watson then determines that the final target will be Big Ben. Watson joins the Prime Minister, Lestrade and much of Scotland Yard to wait for Lupin there but Holmes goes to the Tower of London. He learns that Lupin's past four crimes were distractions from his real target, the Crown Jewels. Holmes sabotages Lupin's plan and confronts him. The two express their mutual admiration for each other. Lupin agrees to return the stolen items and Holmes lets him go, knowing they will not see each other again. Holmes later tells Watson not to write about this endeavor. Gameplay Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars√®ne Lupin is an adventure played from a first person perspective. The player character for the majority of the game is Holmes, though some sections feature Watson and one features Inspector Lestrade. Most of the areas in which the game takes place are based on famous London landmarks, including the National Gallery and British Museum, the former of which features scanned copies of dozens of famous paintings, as well as numerous historical artifacts. Solving the mysteries of the game involve examining locations and discovering clues. Retaining the first-person interface and gameplay of The Awakened, the game follows Holmes and Watson as Holmes as they try to stop Lupin. It is the first in the series to feature a cat-and-mouse style plot, a structure which would be retained for Sherlock Holmes Versus Jack the Ripper. Remastered edition On May 18, 2010, Frogwares released a remastered version of Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars√®ne Lupin. This version adds the option of a third person perspective, as well as walking animations for the sections of the game in which Holmes and Watson are together. The version of the game downloadable from Steam and GOG has been updated to include these changes as well. Reception The first four Sherlock Holmes titles from Frogwares‚ÄîMummy, Silver Earring, The Awakened and Nemesis‚Äîtotaled roughly 1.5 million global sales by February 2009. Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars√®ne Lupin has received mixed reviews on review aggregator Metacritic, with a score of 71 out of 100. GameSpot criticised the game's \\"obtuse puzzles\\". IGN stated that \\"for hardcore adventure fans there is a good challenge here to keep you busy for hours,\\" but criticised the need to backtrack often.Sophia Tong (May 23, 2008) Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis Review IGN, Retrieved 4 May 2013. Note has also been made of a prominent element in the areas in which player plays as Holmes: in the original release, Watson does not have a walking animation, resulting in a \\"creepy\\" Watson who apparently always stands still when in view, but seems to silently teleport closer when the player looks away. \\"Creepy\\" Watson became a viral meme after Youtuber tdous uploaded a video of himself playing the Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis demo. To promote Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, Frogwares made a short video entitled \\"Crimes & Punishments - The Return of Creepy Watson\\" which recreates Creepy Watson in their new game engine.

Asensio (born December 30, 1954 in La Habana, Cuba) is the founder, chairman and president of Asensio & Company, LLC an investment firm established in 1992. Asensio is the recognized pioneer of activist short selling.http://www.nber.org/papers/w19834 He is the author of a book about his short selling work entitled Sold Short: Uncovering the Markets. Career While at Harvard, Asensio began proprietary trading, and established Boca Raton Investment Corp. as his own trading firm when he graduated in 1982. He went to work for Bear Stearns in 1986. Asensio sold companies short he believed to be engaging in fraud, and was noted for publicizing his negative opinions. He made claims of fraud or misrepresentation involving 26 companies as of 2004. According to Asensio, of the 52 companies he publicly campaigned against, the average decline in value was around 86 percent, wiping out $30 billion in market value, from which he grossed millions in profits. Prior to making a short sale, Asensio would look at statements made by the company, to determine if they are flawed, and if claims made by the company can be verified. Asensio said in a 2004 magazine interview that \\"If there's a big variance between that and with what the company is saying, which we know is not right, it is reflected in the stock price that attracts us to a market. If you do identify a security that's trading significantly above its fundamental value and if there are a set of representations made by a company which you find to be faulty, and that those representations impact the stock price, you will make money. If you have the sophistication to be able to trade, you will be able to make a substantial amount of money.\\" His short selling activities and public statements resulted in numerous lawsuits. Asensio claimed to have been sued for $1 billion in seven states as of 2004, and spent around $10 million defending himself, but had yet to lose a monetary judgment. One jury found him guilty of misrepresentation without ordering a judgment. Regulatory sanctions In November 2000, the NASD (now FINRA) sanctioned Asensio & Company Inc. and Manuel Asensio, for Short Selling, Trade Reporting, and Internet Advertising Violations. In July 2006, the National Adjudicatory Council of the NASD upheld a hearing panel's rulinghttp://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@enf/@adj/documents/ohodecisions/p013655.pdf FINRA 2005-01-04. Retrieved 2010-03-20 that barred Asensio \\"from association with any NASD member in any capacity\\" and fined him $20,000. The NASD barred Asensio and his firm for failing to respond to requests for information concerning Polymedica. It found that Asensio made statements in research reports that criticized PolyMedica Corp that were \\"misleading,\\" by stating incorrectly that he was shorting the company when he was not, and by making similar disclosure rule violations. Asensio denied any wrongdoing and all appeals were denied. In August 2007, Asensio Brokerage Services, Inc. (now known as Integral Securities, Inc.) was expelled by FINRA for failure to pay fines and/or costs. As a result of a controversy over Asensio's role in the short selling of Polymedica FINRA imposed a fine and Asensio disbanded his broker-dealer operation.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The town hall was commissioned at the instigation of the West Bromwich Town Improvement Commissioners, chaired by Reuben Farley. The site selected, known as the Lodge Estate, located on West Bromwich Heath, was purchased from the descendants of William Izon, a local iron-founder. The building, which was designed by Alexander & Henman of Stockton-on-Tees in the Italian Gothic style, was built in brick and stone by Trow & Sons of Wednesbury between 1874 and 1875. The existing reading room was converted into an enlarged council chamber in 1924 and the building was extended to create a new reading room at that time. The American singer and pianist, Jerry Lee Lewis, performed in the town hall in 1964 and, more recently, the People's Orchestra have given regular performances. The town hall was the headquarters of the county borough of West Bromwich but ceased to be the local seat of government when Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council was formed in 1974. Description The arches at the entrance of the building are decorated with carved heads representing the months of the year, while the corridor encircling the main hall is tiled with paving by Maw & Company of Coalbrookdale. The ceilings, the iron work, the walls and pillars have been decorated from designs by the architects and the \\"harmonious blending of colours, and the magnificent stencil work costing many days of artistic and patient labour, cannot be too highly praised and words can hardly express the charming effect they have produced.\\"West Bromwich Weekly News, August 1875 The main tower is high. The fine carvings are by the local sculptor, John Roddis, and depict the labours of the 12 months of the year. Grand Organ The Grand Organ in the main hall was a gift from Alexander Brogden, MP for Wednesbury, in 1878. It was built by Forster and Andrews of Hull following the International Exhibition of 1862 and is one of twelve organs built for town halls up and down the country by the firm. In May 1997 the organ was awarded a certificate by the British Institute of Organ Studies (BIOS) as it was considered to be of historic importance for its musical and technical qualities. It was recorded as historic in the National Pipe Organ Register at Cambridge University. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Walsh was educated at Stevens Institute of Technology, Columbia University and at Brooklyn College. After World War II, he founded Brooks Electronics Inc. During the war, he worked with Rudy Bozak at the Dinion Coil Company in Caledonia, New York, developing high voltage power supplies for radar use. Walsh worked as a member of the War Planning Board, where he met and later married Harriet Walsh. They were residents of Millington, New Jersey for many years. They had no children. Walsh may have been involved in the development of the Kettledrum Baffle that one associates with the first Bozak speaker systems. He redesigned the \\"Mark II\\" (Colossus computer) power supply to prolong the unit's life. Later, he was a consultant on very large transformer designs for power distribution. He also developed a high-quality AM radio receiver and an aircraft collision avoidance system. Walsh¬¥s interests extended to loudspeaker design. With the help of Bozak, he developed a direct-radiator design using a single speaker with an aluminum foil cone, operating out of a vertical column, and offering a wide frequency response. A Simple Quality Rating System for Loudspeakers and Audio Systems appeared in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society for July, 1963. He went on to invent the wide-range coherent transmission-line loudspeaker, which was granted U.S. Patent 3,424,873 in 1969 (filed in 1964). Walsh realized that if you took an inverted cone and drove it from the apex, you could have a speaker with a perfect 360-degree horizontal radiation pattern available to reproduce all the audible frequency range. The vertical dispersion was controllable with the choice of materials. This offered a wide variety of designs, based on his patent. In 1971, Martin Gersten founded Ohm Acoustics. Gersten raised the capital needed to buy back the Walsh patent rights from a metal-casting company which had invested with Walsh. Walsh's new speaker design was developed and marketed by Ohm (the Ohm 'A'), after Gersten invented an edge- wound anodized aluminum voice coil, U.S. Patent 3,935,402 (1974), which was needed to make the unit viable. Unfortunately, Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. Former Ohm Chief Engineer, John Strohbeen further developed Walsh's concepts.

Japan's Ministry of Education classifies H≈çgaku as a category separate from other traditional forms of music, such as Gagaku (court music) or Sh≈çmy≈ç (Buddhist chanting), but most ethnomusicologists view H≈çgaku, in a broad sense, as the form from which the others were derived. Outside of ethnomusicology, however, H≈çgaku usually refers to Japanese music from around the 17th to the mid-19th century. Within this framework, there are three types of traditional music in Japan: theatrical, court music (called gagaku), and instrumental. Theatrical Japan has several theatrical forms of drama in which music plays a significant role. The main forms are kabuki and noh. Noh or music is a type of theatrical music. Noh music is played by an instrumental ensemble called . The instruments used are the stick drum, a big hourglass-shaped drum called the , a smaller hourglass-shaped drum called the , and a bamboo flute called the . The hayashi ensemble is performed along with yokyoku, vocal music, in noh theater. Kabuki is a type of Japanese theatre known for its highly stylized dancing and singing as well as the elaborate make-up worn by the predominately all-male cast. The first instances of kabuki used the hayashi from noh performances. Later, kabuki began incorporating other instruments like the shamisen. Kabuki music can be divided into three categories: geza, shosa-ongaku, and ki and tsuke. =Geza= Geza includes music and sound effects played on stage, behind a black bamboo curtain called a kuromisu. Geza music can be further subdivided into three types. The first type is uta or song. Uta is sung accompanied by a shamisen. Typically there are multiple uta singers singing together. The second type is called aikata. It involves shamisen music without any singing. The third type is narimono. Narimono is played by small percussion instruments besides the shamisen. =Shosa-ongaku= Shosa-ongaku encompasses music that is played on the stage and accompanies acting and dancing. Shosa-ongaku includes the Takemoto, Nagauta, Tokiwazu and Kiyomoto music styles. Takemoto accompanies acting. Nagauta, Tokiwazu and Kiyomoto accompany dancing in kabuki (dance drama). Takemoto basically recites the parts of the play concerning scenery. The actors attempt to synchronize their lines with the rhythm of takemoto‚Äîan effect known as ito ni noru (get onto strings). Naguata is one of the most commonly seen forms of gza. It involves singers, called utakata, and shamisen players, called shamisenkata. The utakata are seated to the right of the stage dancers, and the shamisenkata are seated ton the left of the stage. The shamisenkata use hosozao (thin neck) shamisen which produce high pitched tones and are capable of producing delicate melodies. Tokiwazu consists of reciters called tayu and shamisenkata that use chuzao (medium-neck) shamisen. Tokiwazu is similar to Kiyomoto music but is slower-paced and more solemn. Tokiwazu is also performed onstage. Kiyomoto also consists of tayu and shamisenkata using chuzao. However, in kiyomoto words and sentences full of emotion are recited in very high-pitched tones. =Ki and tsuke= Ki and tsuke describe the distinctive sounds made by striking two square oak boards. When the two boards are struck together, they produce the ki sound. When they are struck against a hardwood board, they produce the tsuke sound. Court music (gagaku) is court music, and is the oldest traditional music in Japan. It was usually patronized by the Imperial Court or the shrines and temples. Gagaku music includes songs, dances, and a mixture of other Asian music. Gagaku has two styles; these are instrumental music and vocal music . Since means \\"elegance\\", Gagaku literally means elegant music and generally refers to musical instruments and music theory imported into Japan from China and Korea from 500‚Äì600 CE. Gagaku is divided into two main categories: Old Music and New Music. Old Music refers to music and musical compositions from before the Chinese Tang dynasty (618‚Äì906). New Music refers to music and compositions produced during or after Tang, including music brought from various regions of China and Korea.Randel, Don Michael, The Harvard Dictionary of Music (2003), Belknap Press. , page 339The International Shakuhachi Society Old and New Music are further divided into the categories (\\"Music of the Left\\") and (\\"Music of the Right\\").

There are four main j≈çruri styles. These are centuries-old traditions which continue today: *‚ÄîDuring the Edo period, Takemoto Gidayu () began to play joruri in Osaka. This type of j≈çruri is for bunraku, (puppet plays). *‚ÄîDuring the Edo period, Tokiwazu Mojidayu () began to play this style of joruri in Edo. This type of j≈çruri is for kabuki dances called Shosagoto. *‚ÄîKiyomoto Enjyudayu () began to play this for kabuki dances in Edo (Toko) in 1814 during the late Edo period. He played Tomimoto-bushi style at first. He moved from playing this style to the Kiyomotobushi style. This style is light, refreshingly unrestrained, and chic. *‚ÄîIn the middle of the Edo period, Tsuruga Shinnai () began to play this for kabuki. This style of j≈çruri is typically lively and upbeat. There are other four j≈çruri styles which have largely died out. Kat≈çbushi, Icchuubushi and Miyazonobushi are old style. These styles are referred to as or \\"old music\\". Kokyoku also included .

There are three styles of nagauta: one for kabuki dance, one for kabuki plays (dialogue), and one for music unconnected with kabuki. is similar to nagauta. Ogie Royuu I () (?‚Äì1787) began to play this style, having first played nagauta style. He moved from playing this style to play Ogiebushi style. His rival was Fujita Kichiji () who was a Nagauta singer in Edo. Ogie Royuu I had a beautiful but small voice. In a theater a voice with volume was important, So Ogie Royuu I stopped singing in the theater. Ogie Royuu I began to play in the Yoshiwara (red- light district). Ogiebushi declined after 1818. Tamaya Yamazaburou () composed new Ogiebushi pieces at the end of the Edo Period. Yamazaburou was an owner of a parlor house in the red-light district of Yoshiwara. Yamazaburou knew music very well. Tamaya Yamazaburou's pieces are influenced by music. Iijima Kizaemon () re-established Ogiebushi. Kizaemon changed his name to Ogie Royuu IV in 1876 or 1879. (It is not known if there was an Ogie Royuu II or Ogie Royuu III.) Ogiebushi is classified as a . (Kyoku usually means a musical piece or musical number in modern Japanese. \\"music\\" is old sense.) Now Kokyoku is , , and . Kokyoku is old music from the Edo period. Not many players perform Kokyoku and those who do are elderly; there are few young musicians playing this music. Shakuhachi music music began in the Edo period. Buddhist monks played the shakuhachi as a substitute for a sutra. Sometimes the shakuhachi is played along with other instruments. S≈çkyoku uses the Japanese , which differs from the Chinese (guzheng). There are two well known families of s≈çkyoku, which can be distinguished by the shape of the plectra used in playing. *Yamata ryu‚ÄîOriginated in Western Japan and uses pointed oval-shaped plectra. The repertoire consists of classical pieces composed during the Edo period.

In addition to classical pieces, Ikuta ryu also encompasses more recently composed music such as , thus the majority of modern koto performers belong to this style of S≈çkyoku.

It is located on the Lewes Road (the present A270) in the Round Hill area of the city, northeast of the city centre and approximately north of the seafront. It is the largest church in Brighton by capacity and is noted for its ornate interior. Selecting the site Although the church was built between 1872 and 1875 and consecrated on 1 May 1875, its founding was closely connected with the former Vicar of Brighton, Reverend Henry Michell Wagner, who had served the town from 1824 until his death in 1870. He had been responsible for the construction of several churches during his period of office, including St Peter's which later became the town's parish church. At the time of his death, he was planning the construction of another and had set aside ¬£3,000 from his personal wealth, but had not decided on a location or any other details. Wagner's son, Arthur, had been ordained in 1850. When his father died, Arthur Wagner inherited his wealth and set out to build a church both to commemorate him and to fulfil the plans he had towards the end of his life. To achieve this he convened with his half-brothers Joshua and Henry and decided on a site. The area chosen was largely under construction at the time, with large numbers of small terraced houses for poorer people being built to fill the space around the Lewes Road. Some of this development was funded by Arthur Wagner himself, and as neither this area nor the nearby Round Hill district had a proper church, it was considered appropriate to finance and oversee the building of a church at the same time. (A small temporary church which had been built on a nearby street became a school when St Martin's Church opened.) One action the Revd Henry Wagner had taken before his death was the creation of a \\"building committee\\", consisting of other prominent members of the local clergy. The three Wagners offered this committee a choice between constructing a new church on a site chosen by the committee members - in which case only the original ¬£3,000 set aside for the project would be granted, with the committee paying for any work beyond this - and accepting a site chosen by the Wagners, in which case the brothers would bear the full cost. The committee decided to allow the Wagners to choose the site themselves; accordingly, a position on the west side of Lewes Road, just north of the bottom of Elm Grove, was selected. Construction The first bricks were laid in October 1872. A building contractor named Jabez Reynolds, son of Jabez Reynolds senior who had built about 1,000 houses including many significant buildings in Brighton and Hove, including the Cliftonville area of neighbouring Hove in the 1850s and 1860s, was chosen for the building work, while the architect was George Somers Leigh Clarke, a long-standing friend of the Wagner family: his father had been Clerk of the Vestry (the equivalent of a modern-day parochial church council) of Brighton since 1830, and had provided support to Rev. Henry Wagner during periods of tension between different sects and groups within the Vestry. Clarke (junior) studied under the prominent architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, and his other projects included a collaboration with J. T. Micklethwaite on the design of the new chancel at St. Peter's, the clerestory at St Nicholas, work on Chichester Cathedral and an 8-year surveying role at St Paul's Cathedral, London. Design Interior view of the church The exterior of St Martin's reflects the Gothic Revival interpretation of the Early English style associated with 13th century churches. Its most notable exterior feature is its considerable height, accentuated by the modest height of the majority of the surrounding buildings; brown brick, offset in some places with red, predominates on the outside, and the layout of the church is standard: an aisled nave with chapels on each side, and a chancel. A saddleback tower was included in the original plans but never built: a small bell-arch with a single bell was built instead, towards the north end. The church is on a north-south (liturgical east- liturgical west) alignment parallel with the Lewes Road. The church floor lies six feet below street level, creating an architectural illusion of being larger internally and from the entrance there is an unimpeded view across the nave and into the chancel. Octagonal stone columns topped by brick arches separate the aisles from the nave; above these arches are a series of clerestory windows. A large series of stained windows dominates the west wall.St. Martin's, Brighton- Full Guide. Cannell & Rees-Davis, 2012 A series of 144 painted shields adorn the nave ceiling, representing the Anglican missionary dioceses founded within 100 years of the church. Although the marble altar is not original, dating from 1949, the large reredos above it is. It consists of 20 pictures and 69 statues, all of which were carved in the German town of Oberammergau, noted worldwide for its woodcarving tradition. The original pulpit, surmounted by a unique canopy tapering to 55 feet and dating from 1880, also remains: this, and the font in the raised entrance area, are decorated with materials from the collection of Henry Wagner. The base of the pulpit contains olive wood collected from the Mount of Olives; and the font, built of Sussex marble and installed in 1907, contains a variety of other stones and marble from sites such as Cairo and Pompeii, brought back to England by Wagner himself during his lifetime. Consecration, opening and later events The Bishop of Chichester consecrated the church on 1 May 1875 and the vicar in charge of the temporary church nearby, the Revd R. I. Salmon, was appointed to the perpetual curacy of the new church by the Revd John Hannah, Fr Wagner's successor as Vicar of Brighton. Later in 1875, St Martin's was granted its own parish: that of Brighton The Resurrection. This covers parts of the Lower Bevendean, Queen's Park, Round Hill and South Moulsecoomb areas. The Lady chapel was improved in 1925, the 50th anniversary of the consecration, as a memorial to Fr Wagner, using money raised through a special collection. At the same time, part of the reredos was replaced. The church was closely connected with the former Preston Barracks, situated further up the Lewes Road in the north of the parish. A gallery was built on the east side of the chancel for troops and members of military bands to participate in services; also, two different regiments erected memorials to comrades killed in the Battle of Khartoum in 1884 and 1885. Organ The organ at St Martin's Church was built between 1875 and 1888 by the London-based organ building firm of Hill & Sons, and is housed in an incomplete case designed by Somers Clarke which complements the reredos. With 29 stops over three manuals and pedals, its voicing is influenced by Hill's time in Germany and capable of most repertoire. The Institute of Organ Studies has described it as \\"outstanding\\", and noted its historical importance for being in almost totally original condition. Since 2015 the Organist has been Mr Nic Robinson. Present The church is a Grade II* listed building, defined as a \\"particularly significant building of more than local interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. The church maintains its Catholic style of liturgy and is often involved with other churches of the Wagner dynasty in group events.

He is especially noted for his publications in English Renaissance drama and English Restoration drama; he was the first publisher of the works of John Dryden. He conducted his business under the sign of the Blue Anchor in the lower walk of the New Exchange. Herringman had established himself as an independent bookseller and publisher by 1655. He issued the first edition of Thomas Middleton's Hengist, King of Kent in 1661. Herringman had a reputation as a rare stationer who actually profited from the Great Fire of London (1666), in which most of his compatriots lost their stocks of printed books. He was a member of the syndicates of stationers who issued the major collections of William Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the second half of the century, including the Shakespeare Fourth Folio (1685), the third Ben Jonson folio (1692), and the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio (1679). Herringman also published the collected plays of Thomas Killigrew (1664); the collected works of Sir William Davenant (1673); the Dryden/Davenant adaptation of The Tempest (1670); and plays by Thomas Shadwell, William Wycherley, George Etherege, and Sir Robert Howard, among others. Dryden appears to have had a close professional relationship with Herringman early in his career, when he served as a sort of general editorial assistant in Herringman's business, perhaps to the point of taking his board and lodging with Herringman. In this capacity as a supervisor and reviser of texts, Dryden may have worked on Shakespearean plays for Herringman.Sonia Massai, \\"Taking just care of the impression': Editorial Intervention in Shakespeare's Fourth Folio, 1685', in Holland, pp. 257-70. In addition to dramas, Herringman published a large body of nondramatic literature, including (partnered with John Martyn) the 1678 edition of Samuel Butler's Hudibras, which contained the poem's third and final part. Herringman published works by Abraham Cowley, Katherine Philips, John Donne, Francis Bacon, Roger Boyle, and Robert Boyle. He also produced a wide variety of general-interest works, as well as law books. Herringman became master of the Stationers Company in 1685. After selling his retail business in 1684, Herringman became, in effect, the first wholesale book publisher in England; his imprint exists on 532 publications from his era.Massai in Holland, p. 267.

He spent time in the F√ºhrerbunker in Berlin at the end of World War II. H√∂gl later died from wounds received during the break-out on 2 May 1945 while crossing the Weidendammer Bridge under heavy fire in Berlin. Early life and career H√∂gl was born near Dingolfing in Bavaria. After he left school he worked as a miller in Landshut until he joined the 16th Bavarian Infantry Regiment in 1916; there, he then saw active service in World War I and reached the rank of Unteroffizier. He left the army in 1919 and joined the Bavarian police, transferring to the criminal police in 1932.  Nazi career He joined the SS (member number: 249,998) and became a member of Adolf Hitler's bodyguard unit in 1933 and attained the rank of SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer (first lieutenant) in 1934. From April 1935 he became the deputy to Johann Rattenhuber in the Reichssicherheitsdienst (Reich Security Service; RSD) and later was appointed Chief of RSD Department 1 (responsible for the personal protection of Hitler on a day-to-day basis during the war). In this capacity he was posted to the Obersalzberg, Munich and Berlin. From November 1944 forward, he was stationed in Berlin and held the title of Criminal Director. Beginning in January 1945, H√∂gl spent time in the F√ºhrerbunker located below the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin. In April 1945, it became a de facto F√ºhrer Headquarters during the Battle of Berlin, and ultimately, the last one of Hitler's headquarters. Capture of Hermann Fegelein On 27 April 1945, H√∂gl was sent out from the Chancellery to find Heinrich Himmler's liaison man in Berlin, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer and Generalleutnant of the Waffen-SS Hermann Fegelein who had abandoned his post at the F√ºhrerbunker. Fegelein was caught by the RSD squad in his Berlin apartment, wearing civilian clothes and preparing to flee to Sweden or Switzerland. He was carrying cash‚ÄîGerman and foreign‚Äîand jewellery, some of which belonged to Eva Braun. Fegelein was intoxicated when arrested by H√∂gl and brought back to the F√ºhrerbunker where he was kept in a makeshift cell. The following evening, Hitler was informed of the BBC broadcast of a Reuters news report about Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies via Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden. Hitler in a rage ordered Himmler's arrest. Further, a military tribunal was ordered by Hitler to court-martial Fegelein. Waffen-SS General Wilhelm Mohnke presided over the tribunal which included Generals Rattenhuber, Hans Krebs and Wilhelm Burgdorf. Although he was certain Fegelein was \\"guilty of flagrant desertion\\", Mohnke persuaded his fellow judges to close the proceedings and turned the defendant over to General Rattenhuber and his security squad. Mohnke never saw Fegelein again. Death After Hitler's death on 30 April, H√∂gl, Ewald Lindloff, Hans Reisser, and Heinz Linge carried his corpse up the stairs to ground level and through the bunker's emergency exit to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery. There, H√∂gl and the others witnessed the cremation of Hitler and Eva Braun. On the following night of 1 May, H√∂gl joined Rattenhuber to try and break-out from the Soviet Red Army encirclement.

The Preclassic Maya experienced a similar collapse in the 2nd century.https://www.history.com/news/what-caused-the-maya-collapse- archaeologists-uncover-new-clues The Classic Period of Mesoamerican chronology is generally defined as the period from 250 to 900 CE, the last century of which is referred to as the Terminal Classic.See Stuart and Stuart (1993, p. 12), McKillop (2006, p. 90, pp. 339‚Äì340) The Classic Maya collapse is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in archaeology. Urban centers of the southern lowlands, among them Palenque, Cop√°n, Tikal, and Calakmul, went into decline during the 8th and 9th centuries and were abandoned shortly thereafter. Archaeologically, this decline is indicated by the cessation of monumental inscriptions–ö–Ω–æ—Ä–æ–∑–æ–≤, –Æ. –í. –ü–∏—Å—å–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∏–Ω–¥–µ–π—Ü–µ–≤ –º–∞–π—è. ‚Äî –ú.‚Äî–õ.: –ò–∑–¥-–≤–æ –ê–ù –°–°–°–†, 1963. ‚Äî 664 —Å. and the reduction of large-scale architectural construction at the primary urban centers of the Classic Period. Although termed a collapse, it did not mark the end of the Maya civilization but rather a shift away from the Southern Lowlands as a power center; the Northern Yucat√°n in particular prospered afterwards, although with very different artistic and architectural styles, and with much less use of monumental hieroglyphic writing. In the Post-Classic Period following the collapse, the state of Chich√©n Itz√° built an empire that briefly united much of the Maya region, and centers such as Mayap√°n and Uxmal flourished, as did the Highland states of the K ºiche º and Kaqchikel Maya. Independent Maya civilization continued until 1697 when the Spanish conquered Nojpet√©n, the last independent city-state. Millions of Maya people still inhabit the Yucat√°n peninsula today. Because parts of Maya civilization unambiguously continued, a number of scholars strongly dislike the term collapse.Aimers, James J. \\"What Maya Collapse? Terminal Classic Variation in the Maya Lowlands.\\" J Archaeol Res (2007) 15:329‚Äì377 Regarding the proposed collapse, E. W. Andrews IV went as far as to say, \\"in my belief no such thing happened.\\"Andrews IV, E. W. (1973). The development of Maya civilization after the abandonment of the southern cities. In Culbert, T. P. (ed.), The Classic Maya Collapse, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, pp. 243‚Äì265  Progression of the decline  The Maya often recorded dates on monuments they built. Few dated monuments were being built circa 500 ‚Äì around ten per year in 514, for example. The number steadily increased to twenty per year by 672 and forty by around 750. After this, the number of dated monuments begins to falter relatively quickly, collapsing back to ten by 800 and to zero by 900. Likewise, recorded lists of kings complement this analysis. Altar Q at Cop√°n shows a reign of kings from 426 to 763. One last king not recorded on Altar Q was Ukit Took, \\"Patron of Flint\\", who was probably a usurper. The dynasty is believed to have collapsed entirely shortly thereafter. In Quirigua, twenty miles north of Cop√°n, the last king Jade Sky began his rule between 895 and 900, and throughout the Maya area all kingdoms similarly fell around that time. A third piece of evidence of the progression of Maya decline, gathered by Ann Corinne Freter, Nancy Gonlin, and David Webster, uses a technique called obsidian hydration. The technique allowed them to map the spread and growth of settlements in the Cop√°n Valley and estimate their populations. Between 400 and 450, the population was estimated at a peak of twenty-eight thousand, between 750 and 800 ‚Äì larger than London at the time. Population then began to steadily decline. By 900 the population had fallen to fifteen thousand, and by 1200 the population was again less than 1000. Theories Over 80 different theories or variations of theories attempting to explain the Classic Maya collapse have been identified.Gill (2000, p. 371) From climate change to deforestation to lack of action by Maya kings, there is no universally accepted collapse theory, although drought has gained momentum in the first quarter of the 21st century as the leading explanation, as more scientific studies are conducted.\\"Like most things, collapse explanations are subject to fashion, and the one most in the limelight today is climatic change, or more specifically, megadrought.\\" Quote is from Webster (2002, p. 239); see also article by Diamond (2003) Foreign invasion The archaeological evidence of the Toltec intrusion into Seibal, Peten, suggests to some the theory of foreign invasion. The latest hypothesis states that the southern lowlands were invaded by a non-Maya group whose homelands were probably in the gulf coast lowlands. This invasion began in the 9th century and set off, within 100 years, a group of events that destroyed the Classic Maya. It is believed that this invasion was somehow influenced by the Toltec people of central Mexico. However, most Mayanists do not believe that foreign invasion was the main cause of the Classic Maya collapse; they postulate that no military defeat can explain or be the cause of the protracted and complex Classic collapse process. Teotihuacan influence across the Maya region may have involved some form of military invasion; however, it is generally noted that significant Teotihuacan-Maya interactions date from at least the Early Classic period, well before the episodes of Late Classic collapse.See Braswell(2003) The foreign invasion theory does not answer the question of where the inhabitants went. David Webster believed that the population should have increased because of the lack of elite power. Further, it is not understood why the governmental institutions were not remade following the revolts, which happened under similar circumstances in places like China. A study by anthropologist Elliot M. Abrams came to the conclusion that buildings, specifically in Copan, did not require an extensive amount of time and workers to construct. However, this theory was developed during a period when the archaeological evidence showed that there were fewer Maya people than there are now known to have been.Webster (2002 pp. 221‚Äì223) Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their course. There are no documented revolutions that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions. Collapse of trade routes It has been hypothesized that the decline of the Maya is related to the collapse of their intricate trade systems, especially those connected to the central Mexican city of Teotihuac√°n. Preceding improved knowledge of the chronology of Mesoamerica, Teotihuacan was believed to have fallen during 700‚Äì750, forcing the \\"restructuring of economic relations throughout highland Mesoamerica and the Gulf Coast\\".Webster (2002 pp. 231) This remaking of relationships between civilizations would have then given the collapse of the Classic Maya a slightly later date. However, after researchers learned more about the events and the periods when they occurred, it is believed that the strongest Teotihuacan influence was during the 4th and 5th centuries. In addition, the civilization of Teotihuacan started to lose its power, and maybe abandoned the city, during 600‚Äì650. This differs greatly from the previous belief that Teotihuacano power decreased during 700‚Äì750.Webster (2002 pp. 231‚Äì234) But since the new decline date of 600‚Äì650 has been accepted, the Maya civilizations are now thought to have lived on and prospered \\"for another century and more\\"Webster (2002 pp. 232) than what was previously believed. Rather than the decline of Teotihuacan directly preceding the collapse of the Maya, their decline is now seen as contributing \\"to the 6th-century 'hiatus'\\". Epidemic diseases The disease theory is also a contender as a factor in the Classic Maya collapse. Widespread disease could explain some rapid depopulation, both directly through the spread of infection itself and indirectly as an inhibition to recovery over the long run. According to Dunn (1968) and Shimkin (1973), infectious diseases spread by parasites are common in tropical rainforest regions, such as the Maya lowlands. Shimkin specifically suggests that the Maya may have encountered endemic infections related to American trypanosomiasis, Ascaris, and some enteropathogens that cause acute diarrheal illness. Furthermore, some experts believe that, through development of their civilization (that is, development of agriculture and settlements), the Maya could have created a \\"disturbed environment\\", in which parasitic and pathogen-carrying insects often thrive.Anderson and May (1982); R. Anderson (1982); Lycett (1985). Among the pathogens listed above, it is thought that those that cause the acute diarrheal illnesses would have been the most devastating to the Maya population, because such illness would have struck a victim at an early age, thereby hampering nutritional health and the natural growth and development of a child. This would have made them more susceptible to other diseases later in life, and would have been exacerbated by an increasing dependence on carbohydrate-rich crops. Such ideas as this could explain the role of disease as at least a possible partial reason for the Classic Maya Collapse.Santley, Killion, and Lycett (1986, pp. 140‚Äì141) Drought theory The drought theory holds that rapid climate change in the form of severe drought (a megadrought) brought about the Classic Maya collapse. Paleoclimatologists have discovered abundant evidence that prolonged droughts occurred in the Yucat√°n Peninsula and Pet√©n Basin areas during the Terminal Classic. Large droughts likely caused a decline in agricultural fertility due to regular seasonal drought drying up surface waters,Webster (2002, p. 239) as well as causing thin tropical soils to erode when deprived of vegetation and forest cover.Coe (1999, pp. 26‚Äì27) Climatic factors were first implicated in the collapse as early as 1931 by Mayanists Thomas Gann and J. E. S. Thompson.Gann & Thompson, The History of the Maya, 1931 In 1995, Hodell, Curtis and Brenner published a paleoclimate record from Lake Chichancanab on the Yucat√°n Peninsula that showed an intense, protracted drought occurred in the 9th century AD and coincided with the Classic Maya collapse. In The Great Maya Droughts, Richardson Gill gathered and analyzed an array of climatic, historical, hydrologic, tree ring, volcanic, geologic, and archeological research, and suggested that a prolonged series of droughts likely caused the Classic Maya collapse.Gill (2000, passim.) The drought theory provides a comprehensive explanation, because non-environmental and cultural factors (excessive warfare, foreign invasion, peasant revolt, less trade, etc.) can all be explained by the effects of prolonged drought on Classic Maya civilization.Webster (2002, p. 99) According to Gill in The Great Maya Droughts: > [Studies of] Yucatecan lake sediment cores ... provide unambiguous evidence > for a severe 200-year drought from AD 800 to 1000 ... the most severe in the > last 7,000 years ... precisely at the time of the Maya Collapse.Gill (2000, > p.276 ) The role of drought in the collapse of Classic Maya civilization has remained controversial, however, largely because the majority of paleoclimate records only provide qualitative data, for example whether conditions were simply \\"wetter\\" or \\"drier\\". The lack of quantitative data makes it difficult to predict how climatic changes would have affected human populations and the environment in which they lived. In 2012, a study attempted to quantify the drought using four detailed paleoclimate records of the drought event. Semi- quantitative rainfall estimates were achieved by correlating oxygen isotopes measurements in carbonate cave formations (speleothems) with modern seasonal rainfall amounts recorded in the nearby city of M√©rida, northern Yucat√°n, which were extrapolated back to the time of the Terminal Classic Period. The authors suggest that modest rainfall reductions, amounting to only 25 to 40 percent of annual rainfall, may have been the tipping point to the Maya collapse. Although this analysis referred to the estimated decrease in rainfall as \\"modest\\", subsequent studies suggest that the same data could represent a 20 to 65 percent decrease in rainfall. A study published in the journal Science in 2018 provides the most robust estimate of the magnitude of rainfall reduction to date. Evans and co-authors developed a method to measure the different isotopes of water trapped in the hydrate mineral, gypsum, a mineral that forms in lakes of the Yucat√°n Peninsula during times of drought when the water level is lowered. When gypsum forms, water molecules are incorporated directly into its crystalline structure, and this water records the different isotopes that were present in the ancient lake water at the time of its formation. The \\"fossil water\\" inside the crystals allowed Evans and his co-authors to analyze the properties of the lake water during each drought period. Based on these measurements, the researchers found that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54 percent during the period of the Maya civilisation's collapse, with periods of up to 70 percent rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions, and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7 percent compared to today. This quantitative climate data can be used to better predict how these drought conditions may have affected agriculture, including yields of the Maya's staple crops, such as maize. Critics of the drought theory question the spatial patterns of drought and its relation to the timing of the degradation of Maya city-states. Archaeological research demonstrates that while many regions of the Maya Lowlands were indeed abandoned during the eighth to eleventh centuries CE, other regions experienced only minor disruption, or even flourished.Mann (2006, p. 312) Although the spatial patterns of societal collapse are complex, population centers continued in many coastal regions and in the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula, including as Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Coba, whereas most states in the central regions collapsed and landscapes were depopulated. The reasons for this spatial heterogeneity in societal disintegration are largely unknown, but researches have hypothesised that central regions may have been more affected because of a very deep water table (which would have exacerbated the effects of drought), or that the longevity of the northern regions was likely facilitated by access to the coast, and thus trade routes. Other critics of the megadrought theory, including David Webster, note that much of the evidence of drought comes from the northern Yucat√°n and not the southern part of the peninsula, where Classic Maya civilization flourished. Webster states that if water sources were to have dried up, then several city-states would have moved to other water sources. That Gill suggests that all water in the region would have dried up and destroyed Maya civilization is a stretch, according to Webster,Webster (2002, pp. 243‚Äì245) although Webster does not have a precise competing theory explaining the Classic Maya Collapse. Since publication, further records from the more southerly states have strengthened the argument of a synchronous drought occurring across the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Climatic changes are, with increasing frequency, found to be major drivers in the rise and fall of civilizations all over the world.See for example papers by deMenocal (2001); Weiss (1997); Weiss and Bradley (2001) Professors Harvey Weiss of Yale University and Raymond S. Bradley of the University of Massachusetts have written, \\"Many lines of evidence now point to climate forcing as the primary agent in repeated social collapse.\\"Weiss and Bradley (2001) In a separate publication, Weiss illustrates an emerging understanding of scientists: > Within the past five years new tools and new data for archaeologists, > climatologists, and historians have brought us to the edge of a new era in > the study of global and hemispheric climate change and its cultural impacts. > The climate of the Holocene, previously assumed static, now displays a > surprising dynamism, which has affected the agricultural bases of pre- > industrial societies. The list of Holocene climate alterations and their > socio-economic effects has rapidly become too complex for brief > summary.Quote is from Weiss (1997) A number of causal mechanisms for droughts in the Maya area have been proposed, but there is no consensus among researchers regarding a single causal mechanism. Instead, it is likely that multiple mechanisms were involved, including solar variability, shifts in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, changes in tropical cyclone frequency and deforestation. The Maya are often perceived as having lived in a rainforest, but technically, they lived in a seasonal desert without access to stable sources of drinking water.Gill (2000, p. 382); Webster (2002, p. 239) The exceptional accomplishments of the Maya are even more remarkable because of their engineered response to the fundamental environmental difficulty of relying upon rainwater rather than permanent sources of water. \\"The Maya succeeded in creating a civilization in a seasonal desert by creating a system of water storage and management which was totally dependent on consistent rainfall.\\"Gill (2000, p. 386) The constant need for water kept the Maya on the edge of survival. \\"Given this precarious balance of wet and dry conditions, even a slight shift in the distribution of annual precipitation can have serious consequences.\\" Water and civilization were vitally connected in ancient Mesoamerica. Vernon Scarborough, an archaeologist and specialist in pre-industrial land and water usage practices, believes water management and access were critical to the development of Maya civilization.As reported in McKillop (2006, p. 89) Systemic ecological collapse model Some ecological theories of Maya decline focus on the worsening agricultural and resource conditions in the late Classic period. It was originally thought that the majority of Maya agriculture was dependent on a simple slash-and-burn system. Based on this method, the hypothesis of soil exhaustion was advanced by Orator F. Cook in 1921. Similar soil exhaustion assumptions are associated with erosion, intensive agricultural, and savanna grass competition. More recent investigations have shown a complicated variety of intensive agricultural techniques utilized by the Maya, explaining the high population of the Classic Maya polities. Modern archaeologists now comprehend the sophisticated intensive and productive agricultural techniques of the ancient Maya, and several of the Maya agricultural methods have not yet been reproduced. Intensive agricultural methods were developed and utilized by all the Mesoamerican cultures to boost their food production and give them a competitive advantage over less skillful peoples.See synopsis in Dunning et al.(2002) These intensive agricultural methods included canals, terracing, raised fields, ridged fields, chinampas, the use of human feces as fertilizer, seasonal swamps or bajos, using muck from the bajos to create fertile fields, dikes, dams, irrigation, water reservoirs, several types of water storage systems, hydraulic systems, swamp reclamation, swidden systems, and other agricultural techniques that have not yet been fully understood.Demarest (2004, pp. 130‚Äì147); Sabloff (1994, pp. 81‚Äì84, 139‚Äì140) Systemic ecological collapse is said to be evidenced by deforestation, siltation, and the decline of biological diversity. In addition to mountainous terrain, Mesoamericans successfully exploited the very problematic tropical rainforest for 1,500 years.Sabloff (1994, p. 171), citing Rice and Rice (1984) The agricultural techniques utilized by the Maya were entirely dependent upon ample supplies of water, lending credit to the drought theory of collapse. The Maya thrived in territory that would be uninhabitable to most peoples. Their success over two millennia in this environment was \\"amazing.\\"Demarest (2004, p. 129) Other explanations Anthropologist Joseph Tainter wrote extensively about the collapse of the Southern Lowland Maya in his 1988 study The Collapse of Complex Societies. His theory about Maya collapse encompasses some of the above explanations, but focuses specifically on the development of and the declining marginal returns from the increasing social complexity of the competing Maya city-states.Tainter (1988, pp. 152‚Äì177) Psychologist Julian Jaynes suggested that the collapse was due to a failure in the social control systems of religion and political authority, due to increasing socioeconomic complexity that overwhelmed the power of traditional rituals and the king's authority to compel obedience.

MSV satellite telephony  Most of their current products and services are aimed at emergency services, law enforcement, and companies that specialize in transportation. However, MSV and Boeing are developing a satellite telephony network for consumers. The use of Boeing's GeoMobile platform will allow for coverage of the entire United States with a single satellite. This new approach to satellite telephony has already been validated with the Thuraya network. MSV's satellite will use an even bigger antenna than the Thuraya spacecraft (at 22 meters in diameter, it will be the largest commercial reflector dish ever used in space), allowing it to communicate with phones no larger than modern cell phones because the large antenna gain allows the handset to operate at a power output comparable to regular cell phones. This is now possible since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed satellite operators to create terrestrial cellular networks using spectrum previously restricted to satellite use,MSV Moving Ahead With Second-Generation System PlansOnTheCommons.org  The Looting Continues which means that phones can be compatible with both the upcoming MSV satellite phone network and local cellular networks, allowing a user to communicate over the regular cellular network, and only rely on the satellites in areas outside the range of cell towers.

The other three terminals are: the Constitution River Terminal (located just across the river from the Main Terminal, The Princess Alice Terminal also in Bridgetown, Saint Michael and the Speightstown Terminal in Speightstown, Saint Peter in the north. Also, the three bus depots are located at Weymouth, Saint Michael, Oistins, Christ Church and Mangrove, Saint Philip. Tokens, each valid for one ride. The Barbados Transport Board now has a fleet of approximately 338 buses (eight buses which were destroyed by fire - BM 53, BM 55, BM 113, BM 117, BM 232, BM 251, BM 256 and BM 530). The buses are blue in colour with a yellow trim and white top. The buses had drivers and conductors to collect fares, but now have automatic fare collection machines since the 1990s. The new Wayfarer bus ticket system was introduced in April, 2005 for all Transport Board buses. The Transport Board also compete with the privately owned white and maroon stripe coloured route taxis (called ZRs) and the yellow and blue stripe coloured mini-buses. The Barbados Transport Board was approved in June, 1955 by draft legislation of the Governor of Barbados. Three months later, an act of Parliament was passed on 24 August 1955, establishing the Transport Board. The Transport Board's fleet of buses that they had purchased were; 20 Hino small buses and 40 Mercedes-Benz (OH1621) Marcopolo Torino GV buses in November, 1996 and Mercedes-Benz (OH1622) Alpha Caio large buses in November, 1997 respectively; 15 Hino smaller buses, 50 Mercedes-Benz (OH1420) Marcopolo Torino and 45 Mercedes-Benz (OH1821) Busscar Urbanuss large buses and air- conditioned large buses in November, 1999, respectively when the air- conditioned units were taken off in late September, 2006; 25 Mercedes-Benz (OH1420) Marcopolo Torino large buses in November, 2003; 5 Mercedes-Benz (LO915) Marcopolo Senior Marksell smaller buses in November, 2004; and 65 Mercedes-Benz (T270R) Allison Transmission Marcopolo Torino large buses in November, 2006.

It began as an Internet pornography provider before eventually moving into DVD production. Pink Visual also licenses adult content to cable, satellite, pay-per-view, hotel chain channels, and other Internet content licensees. Currently marketing their content with the tagline of \\"Raw. Raunchy. Real.\\", Pink Visual content is largely reality-based, taking inspiration from reality television. Pink Visual's porn productions typically utilize amateur performers and are shot in a 'Pro-am' style, utilizing digital video, including the high definition format. History Founded in June 2004, Pink Visual evolved out of the formerly established TopBucks webmaster affiliate program, which gave Pink Visual the content and marketing resources to launch into the DVD market. Pink Visual currently has over 300 titles in its portfolio. Typically it releases eight to ten new titles monthly throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. On February 4, 2009, Pink Visual offered a $10 discount on selected sites in \\"compensation for (the) Super Bowl porn mishap\\" in which Tucson, AZ area Comcast customers had their service interrupted for 30 seconds by an uncensored Pink Visual video. iPinkVisual In 2008, Pink Visual launched iPinkVisual.com and iPinkVisualPass.com, the first major U.S.-based mobile porn websites designed especially for iPhones.

Conan the Boobarian On January 18, 2010, Conan O'Brien revealed that he was offered to star in a Pink Visual porno entitled \\"Conan the Boobarian\\" among other job offers following his high-profile exit from The Tonight Show. Anti-Piracy Efforts Pink Visual‚Äôs Anti-Piracy strategy is directed by its General Counsel, Jessica Pena. Pena joined the company in 2008 and immediately recognized the widespread effect of online piracy both for Pink Visual and the adult entertainment industry as a whole. Pena began using litigation strategies to combat online copyright infringement focusing not only on the recovery of damages, but the use of technology to prevent future infringement. Pena‚Äôs approach has evolved to incorporate site operator litigation, legal pressure, end-user education, content removal services and the development of reasonable alternatives to piracy. ‚ÄúIn some ways, the mainstream entertainment space is way ahead of the adult sector in terms of how it fights piracy.‚Äù Pena states, ‚ÄúHaving said that, there are some interesting anti-piracy approaches that adult rights-holders are taking, so my goal is to encourage the minds from both sectors to come together and share ideas that will create even more effective strategies.‚Äù In February 2010, Pink Visual‚Äôs holding company Ventura Content, Ltd. filed suit in the U.S. District Court for New York against Mansef, Inc. the owners of Brazzers, alleging that four company-owned tube sites infringed on 45 copyrighted movies. The suit was settled in October 2010, with terms that remain confidential, other than an agreement between the parties that the site operators would implement digital fingerprint filtering on their sites. In December 2010, Pink Visual filed suit against the operators of SlutLoad.com, alleging infringement on 53 Pink Visual works. The suit was settled in March, 2011, and once again included an agreement that the defendant would implement digital fingerprint filtering. In July 2011, Pink Visual filed suit against Motherless.com, alleging copyright infringement in connection with 19 Pink Visual works, as well as unfair competition for its failure to abide by the adult industries‚Äô age verification and record keeping requirements. Motherless won the case, with the judge ruling they were entitled to the DMCA's safe- harbor provisions.dmca Pink Visual's appeal was thrown out in 2018.appeal In September 2011, Pink Visual filed suit against Two Point Oh Ltd., which operates multiple popular adult sites, alleging infringement on 92 Pink Visual works. The suit was settled in December, 2011 under confidential terms. However, the parties entered into a consent judgment whereby Two Point Oh recognizes that digital fingerprint filtering is a reasonable technical measure to prevent online copyright infringement in the adult arena. In addition to the litigation the company has undertaken to combat copyright infringement, Pink Visual has also organized and hosted two Content Protection Retreats, (CPR) in order to provide information to other adult studios on copyright law and engage in discussions regarding industry strategies, as a whole, to combat piracy. The first CPR took place in October 2010, in Tucson, Arizona. A second CPR was held in February, 2011 in Hollywood California. Dozens of adult entertainment studios participated in the events, hearing presentations from intellectual property attorneys, companies that provide content take-down services and other experts in copyright enforcement and anti-piracy strategy. Pink Visual cites a clear anti-piracy policy to their consumers and looks to educate end-users about the dangers and risks of piracy. Pink Visual content is prohibited from being distributed on torrents and Cyberlocker sites. Pink Visual recommends that consumers purchase legally and provides numerous methods for consumers to access their content legally. Illegal downloads of PinkVisual content are prohibited and considered copyright infringement. In 2012, Pink Visual established an anti-piracy service of its own that performs online copyright infringement location, trademark monitoring, copyright registration and DMCA takedown notice services for rights-holders.

For his writing and performance work on stage he is considered an early pioneer of Asian American theatre. Biography Kashiwagi was born in 1922 in Sacramento, California. He grew up in Loomis, a small fruit-growing town in Placer County, California, where his Issei parents ran a fish market. He attended Loomis Elementary school, Placer High School and Dorsey High School in Los Angeles, graduating in 1940. He also attended Japanese language school, where he did his first writing and performing. During World War II, Kashiwagi and his family were sent to the Tule Lake War Relocation Center, an internment camp for Japanese Americans. In camp, Kashiwagi spent time reading, and joined a theatre group. When the U.S. government forced detainees to fill out a Leave Clearance Application Form, commonly known as the \\"loyalty questionnaire\\", Kashiwagi refused to answer the infamous questions 27 & 28, key questions which asked internees, after a year of unjustified incarceration, if they were willing to swear unqualified allegiance to, and serve in the military for, the same government that had forced them into the camps in violation of the constitutional rights, and, if they were willing to forswear allegiance to Japan, thereby admitting an allegiance to the enemy. Unable to answer \\"yes- yes,\\" to the two questions, the government took Kashiwagi's refusal to reply as a \\"no-no,\\" and he was branded a No-No Boy, and he and his family were segregated by the government as \\"disloyals\\" and were ostracized by the Japanese American community. After the passage of the Renunciation Act of 1944, Kashiwagi and others at Tule Lake renounced their U.S. citizenship under government coercion. After the end of World War II, Kashiwagi attended UCLA. He wrote his first play in 1949 for the Nisei Experimental Group, a theatre group formed in Los Angeles. His one-act play, The Plums Can Wait, was first performed in Los Angeles in 1950, and in San Francisco and Berkeley the following year. He graduated from UCLA, receiving a B.A. in Oriental Languages in 1952. In 1959, with the help of attorney Wayne Collins, Kashiwagi had his United States citizenship restored. Kashiwagi would later dedicate his book Swimming in the American: a Memoir and Selected Writings to Collins, \\"who rescued me as an American and restored my faith in America\\". In 1966, Kashiwagi graduated from UC Berkeley, receiving a Masters in Library Science degree. Kashiwagi worked at the Buddhist headquarters in San Francisco for almost eight years as a translator and interpreter, English secretary and editor. He also was employed at the San Francisco Public Library as a reference librarian in literature, Japanese language materials, science and government documents, and as a branch manager. At the Western Addition Branch Library, he started what became the largest collection of Japanese language books on the West Coast. He retired after 20 years in 1987, when he was cast in Philip Kan Gotanda's play, The Wash at the Eureka Theatre. In 1999, Kashiwagi was awarded the Made in America Award by East West Players. Kashiwagi appeared in several films, including Black Rain, directed by Ridley Scott, and Hito Hata: Raise the Banner produced by Visual Communications. He resided in San Francisco, California, with his wife and had three grown sons, including playwright Soji Kashiwagi, leader of the Japanese American theatre troupe, the Grateful Crane Ensemble. Kashiwagi was a member of Dramatists Guild and Screen Actors Guild. He died on October 29, 2019.

It is located in the town of Frankfort. Mt. Waldo granite was once the stock in trade of a thriving industry. The Mount Waldo Granite has a coarse-grained texture which gives it a more patchy, mottled look than the finer-grained granites. Although granite is no longer quarried here, it can still be seen in buildings in many eastern cities, such as New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. The combination of bare rock ledges and proximity to tidewater made this granite amenable to quarrying in the early 19th century. The two significant quarries in the Mount Waldo Granite in the 19th century were on the northeast flank of Mount Waldo itself, and near the top of Mosquito Mountain. According to a description of the operations from the early 20th century, the quarried stone was taken over graded tracks, operated by gravity, to cutting sheds and wharfs on Marsh River. From there it was taken on the Penobscot River and distributed to eastern ports in Massachusetts, New York, and Philadelphia, and to \\"western\\" cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, and Cleveland.Dale, T.

Glen Street station was built by the Glen Cove Branch Rail Road (an LIRR subsidiary) and opened on May 16, 1867, as the original Glen Cove Station, having finally reached the intended destination of the railroad's namesake. It was the terminus of the branch until the line was extended to Locust Valley in 1869. Glen Cove's first railroad station was located to the northwest of the current station on the land now occupied by a Burger King. It was replaced in 1888. While it is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places (like nearby Sea Cliff Railroad Station), it has been listed as a New York State historic landmark since 1967.

For both genes, the maternal effect lethality was the basis for selection of their names. Medea was named for the mythological Greek Medea, who killed her progeny fathered by Jason. Both Medea and Mothers against dpp were identified in a genetic screen for maternal effect mutations that caused lethality of heterozygous decapentaplegic progeny. Because decapentaplegic is a bone morphogenetic protein in the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, identification of the fly Smad genes provided a much needed clue to understand the signal transduction pathway for this diverse family of extracellular proteins. Humans, mice, and other vertebrates have a gene with the same function as Medea, called SMAD4. An overview of the biology of Medea is found at The Interactive Fly, and the details of Medea genetics and molecular biology are curated on Flybase. Another laboratory used Medea as an acronym to describe a synthetic gene causing Maternal effect dominant embryonic arrest.

Founded in 1971, it is known for producing and operating the S-64 Aircrane helicopter, which is used in aerial firefighting and other heavy-lift operations. Erickson Incorporated operates globally and has a fleet of 69 rotary-wing and fixed- wing aircraft including 20 S-64s. The company was known as Erickson Air-Crane Incorporated until 2014. Erickson's main facility is located in the Southern Oregon community of Central Point. History In 1969, Jack Erickson leased a Sikorsky S-61 helicopter from Wes Lematta of Columbia Helicopters to test the effectiveness of helicopters for logging. Following this test Erickson realized he would need a larger helicopter. He purchased three S-64 Skycranes from Sikorsky Aircraft and founded Erickson Air-Crane in December 1971. He quickly expanded the business to include power line construction and firefighting. In 1973, Erickson began using Aircranes to replace HVAC units on top of high-rises. The following year Erickson invented the anti-rotation device which stabilizes loads and provided for great performance and agility. This new technology allowed the company to begin building power line towers. S-64E Erickson Air-Crane photographed at Ioannina airport, Greece In 1992, Erickson Air-Crane purchased the type certification and manufacturing rights for the S-64 from Sikorsky. Since that time, Erickson Air-Crane has become the manufacturer and world's largest operator of S-64 Aircranes and has made over 1,350 improvements to the airframe, instrumentation, and payload capabilities of the helicopter. In 2007, Erickson was sold to ZM Private Equity Fund, who in 2009 moved the company's headquarters to Portland. Then a privately held company, Erickson announced plans to go public in 2010, which was delayed into 2012. On April 11, 2012, the company completed an initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ market, with ZM Private Equity Fund retaining ownership of 63% of the company. The company acquired Evergreen International Aviation's helicopter unit for $250 million in March 2013. Erickson then bought Brazil-based HRT Participa√ß√µes em Petroleo's oil and gas unit, with the deal expected to be finalized in 2013. The name of the company was changed to Erickson Inc. in February 2014. The following year the company reorganized into three business units: Commercial Aviation Services, Government Aviation Services, and Manufacturing and MRO. Erickson Aircrane used for firefighting operations primarily in Western Australia Erickson appointed government services veteran Doug Kitani as CEO and Director August 31, 2017. He was previously CEO and director of government services firm IAP Worldwide Services. He has also worked in private investment and general management for Honeywell and General Electric. The Evergreen purchase was financed partly with debt, and (together with challenging business conditions) caused Erickson to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2016 to reorganize while keeping the business running. During bankruptcy the company returned to private ownership and emerged from bankruptcy protection in May 2017.

The Sphere standards are the most commonly used and most widely known set of humanitarian standards. Sphere's flagship publication is the Sphere Handbook. Background The 1990s saw a rapid increase in the international activities of humanitarian agencies. This was particularly the case during Great Lakes refugee crisis in 1994. A growing number of donor and NGO evaluations were critical of the responses and actions of many NGOs. There was growing discussion among humanitarian agencies about the lack of standards for providing humanitarian assistance. Some of the preliminary conclusions of the multi-donor Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to RwandaThe International Response to Conflict and Genocide:Lessons from the Rwanda Experience were critical of the performance of humanitarian agencies in the Great Lakes crisis. A number of agencies felt that it was time to get their own houses in order and explored the idea of formulating standards for humanitarian response. Original sponsors and observers Simultaneously, in 1996, discussions were taking place within InterAction and the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response (SCHR) about a project for setting standards. The members of both organizations decided that it would be a good idea to pool their resources and set up a joint project. Thus, in 1997, the Sphere Project was set up with a management committee made up of representatives from each of the SCHR members and representatives from InterAction. More than 25 percent of the funds for the first phase of the project came from the member agencies of the management committee and the rest from a few government donors. From the beginning, three observers were invited to fully participate in the work of the management committee. Sponsors: *SCHR (Care International, Caritas Internationalis, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, International Save the Children Alliance, Lutheran World Federation, Oxfam, World Council of Churches, and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res)Walker and Purdin wrongly indicate that MSF only joined the SCHR and the Sphere Project half way through the process. MSF joined the SCHRin July 1997 and was a sponsor of the Sphere Project from the beginning, paying their assessed contributions for both Phases 1 and 2. They withdrew from the project at the end of Phase 2. Peter Walker, Susan Purdin (2004) Birthing Sphere. Disasters 28 (2), p. 106 *InterAction (165 US-based members; 62 in its Disaster Response Committee) Observers: *Voice *ICRC *ICVA Project The original objective of the Sphere Project was to develop a humanitarian charter and associated set of minimum standards in collaboration with leading NGOs, interested donor governments and UN agencies, to both disseminate the resultant products widely within the international humanitarian system and to encourage their formal adoption and practice by relief agencies and their donors.Sphere Project Proposal In July 1997, the first phase of one year of the project began. Five sectors were chosen to cover the basic sectors in humanitarian response: *water supply and sanitation *nutrition *food aid *shelter and site planning *health services Phase 1 July 1997 to October 1998=Setting minimum standards Five sector committees were formed, each with a manager seconded by one of the sponsoring agencies. The sector committees were made up of experts drawn not only from NGOs, but also from the Red Cross and Inter-governmental agencies such as the UNHCR, WHO, and WFP. The sector committees formulated minimum standards of assistance for each of the sectors.Handbook The intention of the project was that the setting up of minimum standards would help to improve accountability and the overall quality of humanitarian response to those affected by disasters. Humanitarian charter In early 1998, a working group was established to draft the Humanitarian Charter. Its final draft highlighted the importance of three principles in particular: * the right to life with dignity, * the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, and * the principle of non-refoulement. By May 1998, a draft edition of the handbook was posted on the Internet for comments. Phase 1 was extended by four months to October 1998.For more detailed descriptions see: Buchanan-Smith, Margie (2003); How the Sphere Project Came into Being. ODI Working Paper 215, July 2003 and Peter Walker, Susan Purdin (2004) Birthing Sphere. Disasters 28 (2), 100‚Äì111 Phase 2 November 1998 to January 2000 Phase 2 of the project was initiated in November focusing on the publication and dissemination of the standards and the development of training materials. In December, a first draft was published and launched both in Washington, DC, and London. The first draft notes that it was drawn up with the work of some 641 named individuals (plus countless unnamed persons), drawn from 228 organizations, including NGOs, the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement, academic institutions, the United Nations and governmental agencies. It was posted on the Sphere Project site to allow for wide feedback. Training Phase 2 saw the development of extensive training material for using the handbook. The training program focuses \\"mainly on the day-to-day work of the individual humanitarian practitioner.\\" The main method is to use workshops for humanitarian field staff to facilitate the practical application of the minimum standards.Lowry, Sean; Sphere at the end of phase II. Humanitarian Exchange Magazine 17, October 2000. pp 11-13., training materials can be found at Phase 3 November 2000 to December 2004 The handbook was completely revised and a second edition was launched in 2004.Sphere Project Newsletter No. 16 (February 2004) In addition an extensive external evaluation was carried out. After 2004, Sphere took on anew form, with an expanded board replacing the project's management committee. Its focus shifted towards facilitating the work of people already using and promoting Sphere at national and regional levels.  Phase 4, An independent, membership-based organisation  In 2016, Sphere ceased its activities as a time-limited project (‚Äúthe Sphere Project‚Äù) to become an independent, non- profit organisation (‚ÄúSphere‚Äù). The organisation also intensified its efforts on building a global community, bringing together those humanitarian practitioners sharing a commitment to improve the quality and accountability of humanitarian assistance. In June 2018, Sphere launched a membership campaign, inviting humanitarian organisations to formally participate in its governance. Sphere is currently governed by a General Assembly, composed of all Sphere members, and overseen by an Executive Committee, whose officers are elected among the members by the General Assembly. To reflect the new status, Sphere adopted a new logo. Sphere Handbook The Sphere Handbook is Sphere‚Äôs flagship publication. It comprises the Humanitarian Charter, the Protection Principles, the Core Humanitarian Standard, and minimum humanitarian standards in four areas of response: Water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH); Food security and nutrition; Shelter and settlement; and Health. The Handbook is likely the most widely known and internationally recognized tool in the field of humanitarian standards. Considering all of its editions, the Sphere Handbook has been translated in more than 30 languages. The Sphere standards are periodically revised to make sure the Handbook reflects new evidence and evolving practice in the humanitarian sector. First and second edition The first Sphere Handbook was published in 2000, establishing an operational framework for accountability in humanitarian emergencies through the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards. The revised edition in 2004 added food security as a new sector, integrating nutrition and food aid. A new chapter addressed process standards common to all sectors, including participation, monitoring, evaluation, and staff competencies and management. Seven cross-cutting themes were included: children, older people, disabled people, gender, protection, HIV/AIDS and the environment. Sphere Handbook (2004) Third edition The 2011 edition placed a stronger emphasis on protection and safety of affected populations. Disaster risk reduction and early recovery are mainstreamed reflecting the emerging challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. Reference is made to the need for adaptation to urban contexts. The technical chapters were revised to show the importance of greater system-wide preparedness, coordination and technical quality. For example, there was a recognition of the need to support and strengthen local health systems, to provide standards around transitional longer-term reconstruction, and to develop a more integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of malnutrition that addresses wider causes such as poverty and livelihoods in emergencies. Sphere Handbook (2011) Fourth edition The fourth edition has a greater focus on the role of local authorities and communities as actors of their own recovery. More emphasis has been placed on context analysis to apply standards. There are also updated standards in areas such as WASH, palliative care in health, security of tenure in shelter and settlement. New ways of delivering assistance, including cash- based assistance, are also integrated. Sphere Handbook (2018)  Humanitarian Standards Partnership  In 2015, Sphere and six other humanitarian standard initiatives formally joined to establish the Humanitarian Standards Partnership (HSP). The aim of the Partnership is to improve the quality and accountability of humanitarian action across all sectors and a harmonized approach to support the user in the application of standards. The HSP organizes joint training opportunities, research initiatives, and outreach activities. It also runs advocacy activities calling for an increased application of humanitarian standards. The other initiatives which compose the HSP are: * Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (CPMS) (Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action) * Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS) * Minimum Economic Recovery Standards (SEEP Network) * Minimum Standards for Education (Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies) * Minimum Standard for Market Analysis (Cash Learning Partnership / CaLP) * Humanitarian inclusion standards for older people and people with disabilities (HelpAge International, Age and Disability Capacity Program / ADCAP) Funding From the beginning, a decision was made that an important part of the funding would come from the sponsoring agencies themselves, with the remainder made up of funds from governmental agencies. A little over a quarter of the funds for phase 1 came from the SCHR and InterAction with the rest coming from 10 governments. As the budget expanded in Phases 2 and 3, so did the number of government donors, shifting the balance, with governments contributing about 85% of the funds for the latter two phases. Criticisms of Sphere Although generally well accepted, a number of criticisms have been levelled against Sphere both in terms of its humanitarian charter and minimum standards. The first critique concerns the Sphere charter. As the charter was developed by NGOs, its legal validity has been called into question. The charter recognizes that affected persons have a ‚Äòright of assistance‚Äô and describes the legal responsibility of states to guarantee that right. However, while the ‚Äòright to dignity‚Äô and ‚Äòright to assist‚Äô are clearly established in international law, the legal basis of a ‚Äòright to assistance‚Äô is not entirely clear. Furthermore, the right to life with dignity described in the charter is intimately linked to social, economic and political rights that are not sufficiently addressed in the charter. Van Brabant, Koenraad: \\"Regaining Perspective: The Debate over Quality Assurance and Accountability\\" ODI, November 2012 A second criticism has been that Sphere‚Äôs ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach prevents humanitarians from adapting to the diverse cultural, political and security contexts in which they operate. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), one of the prominent critics of Sphere, argues that Sphere ‚Äútend[s] towards being prescriptive, leaving little room for contextual adaption‚Äù, and thus is only useful in an ideal situation. Importantly, a number of French humanitarian agencies feared that donors would disburse funding based on fulfillment of Sphere standards, restricting the ability of agencies to demonstrate success in ways that are not open to formal measurement. They felt that the Sphere approach would ignore non-quantifiable aspects of humanitarian action such as solidarity and witnessing and could devalue efforts of the affected population to solve their own problems MSF Position vis a vis the Sphere Project For an extensive discussion of the MSF position see: Jacqui Tong: Questionable Accountability: MSF and Sphere in 2003 in Disastrs, Volume 28 (2), June 2004, 176-189 Some critics feared that the standards could create unrealistic expectations while ignoring constraints. Failing to meet core Sphere standards could lead to adverse publicity, liability and reprisals. Andr√© Griekspoor: Raising standards in emergency relief: how useful are Sphere minimum standards for humanitarian assistance? BMJ. 2001 Sep 29; 323(7315): 740‚Äì742 A final criticism often raised by non-Western parties is that the Sphere standards impose standardization based on ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù benchmarks. While Sphere does promote close consultation with the affected populations, it imposes very detailed standards that may differ from the wishes of beneficiaries.

There are many dances that reflect the culture of the people, although the dances may have changed throughout the years. Ethnic diversity is also a key factor in influencing the dances of the Zimbabwean culture. These dances are self-reflective, for the entire community because all music and dance are communal events. Dance to Zimbabweans is a very spiritual, powerful tool that carries on traditions, and chronicles the important events of their history and culture. Background The Republic of Zimbabwe has a population that is about 16 million people; the majority, about 76%, live in rural areas. This is a very important detail in light of how many crops are produced by Zimbabwe: coffee, corn, wheat, sugar, tea, and cotton.Stark, A., (1986) Zimbabwe, a Treasure of Africa , Minneapolis, Minn: Dillon Press This agricultural aspect of life is apparent in many of the dances they performWelsh-Asante, K. (2000), Zimbabwe Dance: Rhythmic Forces, Ancestral Voices: an Aesthetic Analysis Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press The official language is English, although the Muslim, Hindu, Bah√°'√≠, and traditional ethnic religions are also practiced. There are at least 20 ethnic groups in Zimbabwe, the majority being Shona (about 5 million people) and Ndebele (about 2 million people). There is some division between these groups due to battles between the Shona and Ndebele people in the previous century. Each group has its own history, subculture, and political significance, yet they share many religious and cultural beliefs as well. Every aspect of their culture influences the dances in which they perform. Music The three distinctive instruments of Zimbabwe include drums (ngomas), the mbira, and the marimba. Different sizes, shapes, tightness of the membranes, and materials used to make drums produce different tones and pitches, just as the different sized wood strips of a marimba create different tones. The mbira is perhaps the most important instrument used. It is plucked with the fingers to produce the melody, and is often used during religious rituals by spirit mediums in order to communicate with ancestral spirits. The mbira, and consequently the mbira dance, has been around for a long time, according to archaeological digs. Mbiras have been uncovered and dated back to the twelfth century.Sheehan, S. (1993), Cultures of the World Zimbabwe, New York: Marshall Cavendish Character and Purpose Dances may be performed for enjoyment or entertainment, during many rituals including spirit possession, to re-create history,Cheney, P. (1990) The Land and People of Zimbabwe. New York: Lippincott as an art form, and as a means of courting. Zimbabwean dance has a very distinct, individual style because the tempo of the music and dance is influenced by the spirit of the dancers. This brings a unique, personal element to the dance culture, as well as flexibility in interpretation of the dances. The dances can be very powerful and can be interpreted differently by each performer and each member of the audience. There are many distinguishing characteristics that define Zimbabwean dance. Rhythm is the most important element to all African dance. Polyrhythms are extremely important, just as they are in the music of Zimbabwe, and all of Africa. The performer can pace their movements in a way that creates a new rhythm to the dance. There is a very downward, earth-bound orientation to all Zimbabwean dances. The knees are often flexed, or soft, and there are flat-footed, shuffling movements that represent the belief in the spirit of the earth being the provider of fertility. Other elements to Zimbabwe dances include isolations, angularity (with the body bent at the waist), asymmetry, improvisation, a swinging quality, and movements outward from the hip. Dances are very self-reflective, evident in the improvisation and emotion expressed, and as with the music of Africa, participation is a key element. People either sing, play an instrument, or dance along; there are rarely spectators. Spirituality is very influential to Zimbabwean dance. Dance is a means of expressing their spirituality, and some evangelical churches in Zimbabwe even incorporate dancing into their worship. There are three main groups in which the dances of Zimbabwe may be classified. The first is ritualistic. This is the broadest category, and includes the most ancient, traditional dances. The second is commemorative. Commemorative dances show the political and social trends of the time. The last is griotic, which includes the historical and ritual dramas. The griotic dances are specifically used to signify oral history using storytelling, music, and praise songs to convey important historical events. Classical dance in Zimbabwe is considered the ‚Äòhigh art of the culture‚Äô, and is very important in meeting the requirements of the aesthetic. The beauty and complexity of the rhythms and movements are very important elements. Classical dances retain specific choreography, complexity, and contexts throughout changing times. article Traditional dance : Asante Welsh,(1985) Traditional dance in Zimbabwe is constantly changing. Traditional dance must adapt to the changing times without becoming too Westernized in order for the traditional culture to remain. The people of Zimbabwe encourage change, but they want to do it within themselves, not change through outside cultural influences. Traditional dances must accommodate change in order to remain tradition, and continue to withstand the test of time. The traditional purposes for many dances have changed, the reason for performing dances change, however the meaning and significance of the dances remain constant. Conventionally, the people of Zimbabwe dance for important people, for example, on the tarmac at the airport at the arrival of Government officials. Traditionally, Zimbabwean dance is not set for the concert stage. A dance, such as a ritual of spirit possession, may last twelve hours, or even days in length. Time is a very important aspect of these dances because the dancer must have time to enter the spirit world of possession, and re-enter the material world. This spiritual experience is difficult to perform on a concert stage with limited time, and is often acted out, or abbreviated in concert- type settings. These dances are preferably performed in a natural setting. In neo-traditional dances, on the other hand, the contexts of the dances have changed, and are considered to be ‚Äòtraditional-like‚Äô. The dance may carry the same importance, and even comprise the same movements, but since the context has changed, the dance is no longer considered strictly traditional. These neo-traditional dances are wonderful keepers of history, and chroniclers of time change for this reason. As the dances change to reflect cultural changes such as politics, weather, urbanization, and outside influences, they show the timeline of history in the culture. This also results in a highly emotional link to the dances and events that they represent because people are relating to their everyday lives and struggles. Mbira dance is a characteristic, traditional ritual dance, accompanied by the mbira instrument. It is designed for specific occasions, usually religious in nature, and it is used to express the people. The Mbira dance is often used to lure spirits to come out through spirit mediums and communicate with the people. This dance is carried on by the elders of the tribes, and is very powerful in its spiritual traditions. The Dinhe dance is a religious dance that is also performed to lure spirits into speaking to the people. A lot of war movements and movements of joy are used in this dance. This dance also reflects the agricultural aspect of life, and such props reflecting these themes may also be used. The Dinhe dance uses different songs to accompany the dance, and the mood of the song indicates which spirits trying to be conjured. The Mhande dance is performed by the midlands tribes and traditional is very important to the dance. The Mbakumba dance is a polyrhythmic dance that is traditionally performed after harvest and is still used today for entertainment. The Jerusarema dance and the Muchongoyo dance are two of the most important, distinctive dances in Zimbabwe, and are both accompanied by drums. Both of these dances are traditional, and can be recognized by the people almost immediately upon the first few movements of the dance. The Jerusarema dance represents the Shona culture and it is polyrhythmic with circular motions, and acrobatics and repetition are very prominent. The Jerusarema dance is a traditional dance that can be performed at celebrations, funerals, recreational competitions, and is also performed as a war dance.Welsh-Asante, K. (Jun., 1985) The Jerusarema Dance of Zimbabwe, Journal of Black Studies, Vol. 15, No. 4, pp. 381-403. Funerals have a significant purpose for the dance because the dance is used to usher the dead out and into the ancestral spirit world wherein they may be called upon in future ritualistic ceremonies. Traditional clothing, which includes dried-grass skirts and bare chests, is used during the performance of the Jerusarema dance, and the colors of black or dark blue and white, which are the traditional colors of the Shona people, are worn. The Mbende Jerusarema dance was relisted on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. The Muchongoyo dance represents the Ndebele culture and is traditionally performed in preparation for war and after war, especially when the Ndebele are victorious. The Muchongoyo is also used as a military training exercise, and is characteristically performed with a stick and a shield. The Muchongoyo dance is also a social and recreational dance, and does not have a religious feature; instead it highlights the events of the society. The signature movement is stamping, and dramatic gestures as well as a mimetic element are essential. The dress is neo-traditional, accommodating the changing times, but still resembling the traditional costume. Males historically perform this dance; however females participate by creating the music.

It was shown on CBBC during 2001. There were 3 seasons in all.  Plot  Dr Melvyn P Otter is the GP for a small group of animals. He lives in a delightful riverside house with his wife, Raylee and his faithful assistant, Flybread (a cat). Each episode, Dr Otter is called upon to tend his little catchment area, which include Mrs Canny Body, Dunston the mole and the Rabbit family, as well as a newt called Lucky.  Characters  * Dr Otter - is voiced by Rob Rackstraw, who also voices the naughty scarecrow Spud, in \\"Bob the Builder\\". He is rather a dapper otter, who always manages to unravel any difficult situations, usually caused by the inexperience of Flybread. He is a kindly soul, trusted by the tiny community. * Raylee (voiced by Jan Francis) - is his wife, she offers assistance in all the episodes. She is very level headed and calm. * Flybread - Dr Otter's assistant, has a tendency to arrogance, but he is really somewhat inexperienced and gets himself into amusing little situations, always to be rescued by Dr Otter or Raylee. He has a very \\"posh\\" accent. * Mrs Canny Body - is a delightful old lady who loves to bake cakes for everyone in the community. There is only one problem, they are as hard as concrete and everyone hates them! In at least one episode the cake is used for a completely different purpose to that which was intended. (for instance, a spare tyre!) * Dunston - is a very old and blind mole who lives alone and finds it hard to manage. He gets very confused, and wears an old holey jumper. He needs help in quite a few of the episodes. * The Rabbit family - consist of dad Dexley and mum Dandelion. Their brood often get into scrapes, as well as getting mysterious \\"diseases\\" that tend to be \\"solved\\" quite easily by Dr Otter -(wiping off red spots on faces caused by felt tip pen, etc.)- whilst poor Flybread tends to be poring medical journals for causes of the bogus spots. As well being voiced by Rob Rackstraw and Jan Francis, the other characters are voiced by Maria Darling and Jimmy Hibbert.

Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and fault tolerance. Solr is widely used for enterprise search and analytics use cases and has an active development community and regular releases. Solr runs as a standalone full- text search server. It uses the Lucene Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it usable from most popular programming languages. Solr's external configuration allows it to be tailored to many types of applications without Java coding, and it has a plugin architecture to support more advanced customization. Apache Lucene and Apache Solr are both produced by the same Apache Software Foundation development team. History In 2004, Solr was created by Yonik Seeley at CNET Networks as an in-house project to add search capability for the company website. In January 2006, CNET Networks decided to openly publish the source code by donating it to the Apache Software Foundation. Like any new Apache project, it entered an incubation period which helped solve organizational, legal, and financial issues. In January 2007, Solr graduated from incubation status into a standalone top-level project (TLP) and grew steadily with accumulated features, thereby attracting users, contributors, and committers. Although quite new as a public project, it powered several high-traffic websites. In September 2008, Solr 1.3 was released including distributed search capabilities and performance enhancements among many others. In January 2009, Yonik Seeley along with Grant Ingersoll and Erik Hatcher joined Lucidworks (formerly Lucid Imagination), the first company providing commercial support and training for Apache Solr search technologies. Since then, support offerings around Solr have been abundant. November 2009 saw the release of Solr 1.4. This version introduced enhancements in indexing, searching and faceting along with many other improvements such as rich document processing (PDF, Word, HTML), Search Results clustering based on Carrot2 and also improved database integration. The release also features many additional plug-ins. In March 2010, the Lucene and Solr projects merged. Solr became a Lucene sub project. Separate downloads continued, but the products were now jointly developed by a single set of committers. In 2011 the Solr version number scheme was changed in order to match that of Lucene. After Solr 1.4, the next release of Solr was labeled 3.1, in order to keep Solr and Lucene on the same version number.Solr3.1 - Solr Wiki. Wiki.apache.org (2013-05-16). Retrieved on 2013-07-21. In October 2012 Solr version 4.0 was released, including the new SolrCloud feature.Apache Lucene. Lucene.apache.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-21. 2013 and 2014 saw a number of Solr releases in the 4.x line, steadily growing the feature set and improving reliability. In February 2015, Solr 5.0 was released, the first release where Solr is packaged as a standalone application, ending official support for deploying Solr as a war. Solr 5.3 featured a built-in pluggable Authentication and Authorization framework. In April 2016, Solr 6.0 was released. Added support for executing Parallel SQL queries across SolrCloud collections. Includes StreamExpression support and a new JDBC Driver for the SQL Interface. In September 2017, Solr 7.0 was released. This release among other things, added support multiple replica types, auto-scaling, and a Math engine. In March 2019, Solr 8.0 was released including many bugfixes and component updates. Solr nodes can now listen and serve HTTP/2 requests. Be aware that by default, internal requests are also sent by using HTTP/2. Furthermore, an admin UI login was added with support for BasicAuth and Kerberos. And plotting math expressions in Apache Zeppelin is now possible. Operations In order to search a document, Apache Solr performs following operations in sequence: # Indexing: first of all, it converts the documents into a machine-readable format which is called Indexing. # Querying: understanding the terms of a query asked by the user. These terms can be images or keywords, for example. # Mapping: Solr maps the user query to the documents stored in the database to find the appropriate result. # Ranking the outcome: as soon as the engine searches the indexed documents, it ranks the outputs as per their relevance. Community Solr has both individuals and companies who contribute new features and bug fixes. Integrating Solr Solr is bundled as the built-in search in many applications such as content management systems and enterprise content management systems. Hadoop distributions from Cloudera, Hortonworks and MapR all bundle Solr as the search engine for their products marketed for big data. DataStax DSE integrates Solr as a search engine with Cassandra. Solr is supported as an end point in various data processing frameworks and Enterprise integration frameworks. Solr exposes industry standard HTTP REST-like APIs with both XML and JSON support, and will integrate with any system or programming language supporting these standards. For ease of use there are also client libraries available for Java, C#, PHP, Python, Ruby and most other popular programming languages.

Epstein attended Torrey Pines High School in San Diego, California. He kicked a 58-yard field goal in the 1997 California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) championship game and was rated by various ratings agencies and all-star selection committees as the best kicker in the national high school class of 1998. As a senior, Epstein led the 2001 Michigan Wolverines in scoring and was selected by conference coaches as a second-team selection on the All-Big Ten team as a placekicker. He tied a Michigan record with a 56-yard field goal in 1999 and broke it with a 57-yard field goal in 2001, both against Michigan State. He played for two Michigan teams that won Big Ten Conference championships. He was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the seventh round of the 2002 NFL draft. He also played for the Minnesota Vikings, Berlin Thunder, Edmonton Eskimos and Rhein Fire. He played for a Thunder team that won a World Bowl championship. Early life Epstein, who is Jewish, was born in San Diego, California. He was a Parade All-American at Torrey Pines High School and honored as the top kicker in the nation by Prep Football Report and PrepStar College Recruiting. In the 1997 CIF Championship game, he kicked a 58-yard field goal. Epstein's 1997 kick was a San Diego section CIF record (tied with Nate Tandberg's 1995 kick) until David Quintero posted a 59-yard kick on September 11, 2015. He participated in the July 25, 1998 47th Annual Shrine All-Star Football Classic of California All-stars against Texas All- stars, but missed two early field goal attempts in a 10‚Äì5 victory. University of Michigan Epstein enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1998 and played college football as a placekicker and punter for head coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1998 to 2001. He was successful on 26 of 42 field goals and 85 of 88 extra point attempts. Epstein also averaged 39.9 yards on 167 punts (50 of which were downed inside the 20 yard line) at Michigan. He was a two-time finalist for both the Lou Groza and Ray Guy Awards at Michigan, according to some sources, but the University of Michigan seems to only recognize him as Guy Award finalist as a junior in 2000. Epstein's freshman season for the 1998 Wolverines was the redshirt 5th year senior season for Michigan placekicker Jay Feely. His only point of the season was a PAT against Eastern Michigan on September 19. Of Epstein's 10 career tackles, his only 2-tackle performance came against Minnesota in the October 31 battle for the Little Brown Jug. Epstein performed punting duties for the team in its final two games against and Arkansas (in the 1999 Florida Citrus Bowl), landing 6 of his 9 punts inside the 20 yard line and averaging 40.1 yards per punt. Michigan finished the season as Big Ten Co-champions with Ohio State and Wisconsin. Jeff Del Verne kicked field goals for the 1999 Wolverines early in the season. In fact, Del Verne led the team in scoring after 5 games. However, on October 9 (in the team's sixth game), Epstein tied Mike Gillette's November 19, 1988 Michigan record for longest field goal with a 56-yard kick against Michigan State in the Michigan‚ÄìMichigan State football rivalry game. The kick was the longest ever by a Michigan State opponent at the time. It was the first successful field goal of Epstein's Michigan career (following two previous misses). On October 30, 1999, his 20-yard field goal with 18 seconds remaining clinched a 34‚Äì31 victory over Indiana for Michigan. That day would be Epstein's highest scoring day as a Wolverine (2‚Äì2 FGs and 4‚Äì4 in PATs). The game marked the first time that he handled the placekicking, kickoff and punting responsibilities. Of his seven kickoffs 3 were touchbacks and 3 more were covered inside the 20. Epstein punted six times, resulting in his first 50-yard punt and 2 punts landing inside the 20 yard line. For his efforts, he earned his first Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week award. Epstein was the first player to handle placekicking, kickoff and punting responsibilities for Michigan since Mike Gillette in 1988. In overtime in the January 1, 2000 Orange Bowl against Alabama, his PAT provided the margin of victory (after he missed a 36-yard field goal at the end of regulation time). Epstein finished the season with 36 points (5‚Äì8 FGs and 21‚Äì22 PATs) and 32 punts for 1282 yards (40.1 average/7 inside 20). In 2000, Epstein and Del Verne split kicking duties (sometimes in the same game). On September 16, 2000, Epstein missed a 24-yard field goal for the 2000 team with 3:24 remaining against to UCLA. Although Michigan got back within field goal range, John Navarre was intercepted on the 15-yard line and the team lost 23‚Äì20. In that game, Epstein, who totalled 400 punt yards on 9 attempts, had landed what would become his career high 5 punts inside UCLA's 20-yard line and executed his first career 60-yard punt.(to retrieve Epstein's college statistics, enter \\"epstein\\" in the box for the player's last name) On October 14, he executed a 67-yard punt that was downed inside the 20-yard line and became his career long against Indiana. On November 4, Epstein was thwarted on an attempt to tie the game at the end of regulation when a 57-yard field goal attempt went through the hands of his holder against Northwestern in a 54‚Äì51 loss after Northwestern scored a go-ahead touchdown with 20 seconds left. Earlier in the game, he had completed a 6-yard forward pass and a 52-yard field goal. On November 18 against Ohio State in the Michigan‚ÄìOhio State football rivalry game, Epstein scored 8 points (a 25-yard field goal and 5 PATs). He dropped 3 of his 6 punts inside the 20 yard line and posted a touchback when kicking off to Ohio State with 1:18 remaining to force them to attempt to drive from their own 20. He earned his second Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition. Epstein finished the season with 50 points (8‚Äì14 FGs and 26‚Äì28 PATs) and 55 punts for 2224 yards (40.4 average/19 inside 20). He earned All- Big Ten Conference honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter and placekicker. Epstein was one of 10 finalists for the inaugural Ray Guy Award. Michigan finished the season as Big Ten Co-champions with Purdue and Northwestern. When Epstein's field goal attempt for the 2001 Wolverines was blocked on September 8 with 9:11 remaining against Washington and run back for a touchdown, it gave the Huskies a lead that they would not relinquish on the way to a 23‚Äì18 game. Epstein made a 51-yard field goal against Iowa on October 27 to give Michigan a 6-point lead with 3:57 remaining. The 32‚Äì26 score held up. He posted a school record 57-yard field goal against Michigan State in the November 3, 2001 Michigan‚ÄìMichigan State football rivalry game known as Clockgate. However, later in the game, Epstein's short punt and two Michigan penalties, made way for Michigan State's controversial game-winning drive. He made the game-winning 31-yard field goal against the Wisconsin on November 17, 2001 with 10 seconds left. Epstein set up the field goal when his punt bounced off of Badger Brett Bell and was recovered by Brandon Williams with 14 seconds left. In the game 3 of his 8 punts were downed inside the 20 yard line, including a 48-yarder that was downed on the 1-yard-line to set up Michigan's first score. 3 of his 5 kickoffs were touchbacks and a fourth one into the end zone was just returned 15 yards. Epstein's performance earned him Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition and his 8 points (2 FGs and 2 PATs) gave him the team scoring lead with 69 points. He finished the season with 76 points (13‚Äì20 FGs and 37‚Äì37 PATs) and 71 punts for 2790 yards (39.3 average/17 inside 20). Epstein's single-season punt yardage total was a school record that was surpassed the following season by Adam Finley. His 76 points just edged out B. J. Askew's 72 points and Marquise Walker's 68 points. Epstein earned All-Big Ten Conference second team honors as a placekicker from the coaches and honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter. He concluded his career by making 2 field goals in the January 26, 2002 Senior Bowl. Professional career Epstein was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2002 NFL Draft and played in six games with the Jaguars in the 2002 NFL season before being picked up off waivers by the Minnesota Vikings on October 23, 2002, where he was a kickoff specialist for the remainder of the season. Epstein tore his anterior cruciate ligament with one week remaining in the 2002 season and had offseason surgery. Despite being reactivated during the 2003 preseason, he was released before the 2003 season. 43-year-old Gary Anderson performed the PATs and field goals for the 2002 Vikings. Anderson, had been brought out of retirement during the season to contribute to the Vikings' special teams efforts as Doug Brien faltered. Epstein replaced Brien. As a Jaguar, Epstein made 5 out of 9 field goals (with a long of 34 yards) and 13 PATs. He was 0‚Äì4 on field goals of 39 yards or longer. Of his 72 career kickoffs, 10 of them were touchbacks and his average distance was 61.7 yards. After Epstein was released, the Jaguars continued to have troubles as his successor Tim Seder was cut five games later. 8 of Epstein's 28 career points came in a 28‚Äì25 October 6, 2002 Jacksonville victory over Philadelphia. He was 2-for-2 on both field goals and PATs. The Denver Broncos signed Epstein in February 2004 and assigned him to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe. He was released in September 2004. He was the punter and performed kickoffs for the World Bowl XII champion 2004 Thunder team, although Jonathan Ruffin performed field goal attempts for them. The Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League signed Epstein during the 2005 CFL season. He appeared in four regular season games for Edmonton, made 8 of 12 field goal attempts, and punted 16 times for an average of but that record and especially a blocked kick on September 18, his final game for the Eskimos, resulted in his release on September 29. Edmonton went on to win the 93rd Grey Cup. The Houston Texans signed him in January 2006 and assigned him to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe. He was released in May 2006. On February 6, 2008, Epstein signed back on with the Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL, but he was released again on April 28.

Uriangato city is geographically united to Moroleon city and Yuriria city, these three cities are a metropolitan area. Since October 2010, this metropolitan area is the 75th biggest city of Mexico and the 5th biggest in Guanajuato. It is smallest of the 56 metropolitan areas in Mexico.  Toponymy  Uriangato is the Spanish version of a Purepecha word that means \\"the place where the sunset occurs on top\\" or anapu-nani-hima-huriata-hari- jatzhicuni-anandini in Purepecha.  Human development  Uriangato downtown. Uriangato's principal church. Uriangato downtown's principal garden. Traditional building in Uriangato. Principal Garden in Uriangato. According to the United Nations/PNUD, in 2005 Uriangato was a municipality of High Human Development, with an index of 0.8147 (scale 0 to 1). This puts Uriangato at 432nd place in the country (2,454 municipalities of M√©xico) and 8th in all Guanajuato state (46 municipalities of Guanajuato), in terms of quality of life. An average person in Uriangato earned $8,607 US dollars ($110,200 pesos) during one year (2005), which puts Uriangato in 365th place in the country and 12th place in Guanajuato state. Uriangato, like all of Guanajuato state, is considered by CONAPO to be a High Migration Municipality, because more than 10% of its families receive money from their relatives in the United States. This situation has improved the quality of life in Uriangato, most of whose emigrants live in California, Texas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York.  History  Neoclasic architecture at Uriangato's downtown Public fountain in San Miguel Arcangel's church Uriangato's land belonged to several native groups of Tarascos since the end of the 14th century. In 1597 Juan Ignacio C√≥rcoles began to administer the Royal Certificate. Uriangato became part of Spain on February 20, 1604, by mandate of King Felipe III, who bestowed on it the official name of San Miguel de Uriangato. On November 19, 1845, the state congress of Guanajuato designated it as a Town, and in 1951 the local Congress granted it the title City of Uriangato.  Pre-Hispanic age  In pre-Hispanic times Uriangato was inhabited by native Purh√©pechas (Tarascos). At the beginning of the 15th century Uriangato and its environs were a territory between the Chichimecas and Pur√©pechas whose opposing three kingdoms (se√±or√≠os) were located in what is today the State of Michoac√°n. The territory of Uriangato comprised the North border of the three Se√±or√≠os Tarascos; the \\"Great Chichimeca,\\" named by the Spanish conquerors, began to the north of the Lerma River. The Spanish conquest of the New World left an indelible mark with the establishment of an indigenous population in the region.  Settlement  San Miguel Uriangato was founded in 1549 with the aim of improving natives' quality of life under the guidance of Fray Diego de Ch√°vez. On June 3, 1701 the Spanish Virrey (Viceroy) granted protection to the Mayor and the settlers of San Miguel Uriangato. In 1790 construction began on the Church's ‚Äútwo Towers,‚Äù where the Sanctuary of Lady of Guadalupe is located today. In 1804 Mayor Jose Dionisio Vallejo, as well as Juan Vallejo Bautista, asked the government for 600 varas (503 meters; at the virreinal time a vara was equivalent to 33 inches) for each cardinal point, the equivalent of the municipality of Yuriria today. Subsequently, new lands were annexed when the citizens of Yuriria observed the advantages of belonging to nearby San Miguel Uriangato. Land was similarly annexed by Morole√≥n's first inhabitants from Uriangato to form Morole√≥n's new municipality.  From Independence to Mexican Revolution (1810-1910) San Miguel Arc√°ngel's church In 1810 an insurgent army commanded by the priest Don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla arrived at Uriangato, on the road to Valladolid‚Äînow known as Morelia‚Äîcomprising the so-called Route of Independence‚Äîtoday route 2010.  Early 20th century  On December 10, 1908 the town of Uriangato officially became a Villa, by Decree Number 6 of XXIII, the Congress of the State. On November 9, 1951, the XLI Legislature of Guanajuato state's Congress declared Uriangato a City. By the end of 1908 the Kiosco of the Main Garden was constructed, and a year later street cars linked the Towns of Uriangato and Morole√≥n. Up until that time Uriangato's perimeter consisted of the following streets: 16 of September, Insurgente Olivares, Salvador Urrutia and Lerdo. On June 24, 1918 the Heroic Defense of Uriangato was carried out against the notorious local bandit J. In√©s Ch√°vez Garc√≠a. Garc√≠a was typical of many Post-Revolutionary bandits who assaulted Mexican towns at that time. In 1919 a clock was added to the tower of San Miguel Arc√°ngel church, whose construction was completed on November 10, 1923.  Textile industry beginnings  The production of rebozos (shawls) energized the textile industry by the middle of the 20th century in Uriangato and Morole√≥n. Little by little people took to producing handmade artesanal sweaters, blouses and shirts woven with a hook needle. The 1960s saw Uriangato's first clothing factories. Many textiles produced in Uriangato were sold in other Mexican cities. Nevertheless, due to the great demand for Uriangato-made clothing, the first street market (tianguis) was installed by the 1980s. The tianguis characterizes Uriangato all over M√©xico and elsewhere. It has contributed greatly to the progress and improvement of Uriangatenses' quality of life. Nearly sixty-percent of Uriangatenses work in the clothing business.  21st century  In 2003 the Congress of the State issued Decree 204,\\" which ordered that Morole√≥n return to Uriangato of land located from the present borderline to the community of \\"El Salto.\\" This decree was vetoed on August 7, 2003 by the Governor of Guanajuato Juan Carlos Romero Hicks with the aim of avoiding social unrest. In 2004 the construction of the Aldama vestibule and the remodeling of Uriangato's historical downtown were completed, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Uriangato's legal foundation. The festivities were accompanied by a light and sound show, as well as a folkloric ballet presentation directed by Amalia Hernandez. On July 17, 2008 the first mall in the region opened: Metropolitan Galleries, including a supermarket (Soriana), a 7-part movie theater (Cinepolis), a fast- food court, bank, and several stores providing a variety of services and merchandise‚Äîas well as a large parking lot.

(1) It lies directly west of the city of Uriangato, and is a part of the Uriangato-Morole√≥n metropolitan area that includes the two municipalities. The city is the seat of the municipality. In the Mexican census of 2005 the city had a population of 41,909 inhabitants, while the municipality had a population of 46,751. The municipality has an area of 164.97 km¬≤ (60.606 sq mi). Moroleon is considered an important clothes shopping destination in Guanajuato, with clothing stores that line the streets for miles as it is one of the leading cities of the textile industry in all of Mexico. On the 16th of January, there is a big festival to celebrate the history of the church. Also, there is another celebration on the 16 of September to recognize the independence of Mexico. Nearby cities include Uriangato, Yuriria and Morelia.

She established herself as a rising figure in the fashion industry by posing for magazines including Vogue and designers such as Vera Wang and Nina Ricci. Korshunova's unexpected death, killed under unexplained circumstances, became a longtime controversial subject of international attention. Early life and career Ruslana Korshunova was born in Almaty, Kazakh SSR. Her father, Sergey Korshunov, died in 1992 when she was 5 years old. Her mother Valentina (n√©e Kutenkova) and her elder brother Ruslan live in Kazakhstan. With different degrees of fluency she spoke Russian, Kazakh, English and German. She was discovered in 2003, when All Asia magazine printed a story on Almaty's local German language club, which Korshunova was then attending. Her photograph, which was featured in the article, caught the attention of Debbie Jones of Models 1; Jones tracked down and signed up the then 15-year-old Korshunova, who was nicknamed the Russian Rapunzel for her knee‚Äìlength chestnut hair in her early work. Korshunova was represented by IMG (New York, Paris, London and Milan), Beatrice (Milan), Traffic Models (Barcelona), Marilyn Model Agency and iCasting Moscow, which was her mother agency. British Vogue hailed Korshunova as \\"a face to be excited about\\" in 2005. Korshunova modeled for the covers of French Elle and the Polish and Russian versions of Vogue. She also modeled in print-ads for Nina Ricci, Blugirl by Blumarine, Clarins, Ghost, Girbaud, Kenzo Accessories, Marith√© & Fran√ßois, Max Studio, Moschino, Old England, Pantene Always Smooth, Paul Smith and Vera Wang lingerie. Death On 28 June 2008, at around 2:30 p.m., Korshunova died after falling from the ninth-floor balcony of her apartment at 130 Water Street in the Financial District of Manhattan, USA. Police stated there were no signs of a struggle in her apartment and concluded that Korshunova's death was an apparent suicide. One of Korshunova's friends stated that she had just returned from a modeling job in Paris, noting that she seemed to be \\"on top of the world\\" with no apparent reason why she would commit suicide. Korshunova planned to celebrate her 21st birthday on Wednesday in Pennsylvania. Korshunova's former boyfriend, Artem Perchenok, stated that he dropped Korshunova off at her apartment several hours before her death after they watched the Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore film Ghost together. \\"I feel that she came to say goodbye\\", said Perchenok.Model's suicide shocks boyfriend NY Daily News. (06/30/2008). Retrieved June 10, 2009. \\"She was a good person\\", he added to The New York Post. However, Korshunova appeared brokenhearted and angry in some of her postings on a social networking site. Korshunova's most telling message came in March 2008: \\"I'm so lost. Will I ever find myself?\\". Experts did not find traces of someone else's skin underneath her nails. Korshunova's mother, Valentina Kutenkova does not believe in her daughter's suicide. \\"She told me about her work problems about a year ago. She said that she wanted to quit the modeling business. Everything was fine with her recently though. If she had problems at work, she would have told me\\", she said. Muhammad Naqib, a concierge who worked in Korshunova's building stated, \\"I was shocked when I saw her on the pavement. She was on the road, small and pitiful, in a puddle of blood, surrounded by a crowd. Her arms and neck were broken\\", the man said. Muhammad was immediately suspicious. \\"Only next day I realized what was wrong. It was her hair! It was much shorter than when I last saw her that night, lively and happy. It seemed like it was cut in a hurry since the ends were uneven.\\" Moscow mortician Sergey, who worked on her makeup in a Moscow morgue, stated \\"All I got is a polite 'thank you'. But nobody called me for an interview ... [t]he hair could fall out because of a strong impact, but it could not become shorter. When I was preparing the body for a funeral, I noticed that the hair was in a very poor condition. I even offered to find her a wig, but her relatives refused. The ends were uneven, as if someone had cut it with scissors.\\" According to the testimony of many witnesses, no strangers or suspicious people were noticed on the day of Korshunova's death in her building on Water Street. The back exit in the yard is visible to the concierge, and nobody could pass by the reception unnoticed. During her last visit, Korshunova's mother stopped at the apartment. According to Korshunova's friends, Valentina spent several hours at the door of the apartment. She is still hoping to find the answer from the local police. On July 7, 2008, Korshunova was buried at Khovanskoye Cemetery in Moscow. Her mother stated to Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that the Russian capital was one of her daughter's favorite cities, and that \\"[She] would want her beloved Moscow to be her last resting place.\\" British TV producer and filmmaker Peter Pomerantsev has theorised that Korshunova's suicide was related to her involvement with Rose of the World, a controversial Moscow-based organisation which describes itself as \\"training for personality development\\". While researching for a documentary into Korshunova's death, Pomerantsev learned that the model spent three months attending training session at Rose of the World. These sessions‚Äîwhich encourage participants to share their worst experiences and recall repressed memories‚Äîare modelled after Lifespring, whose controversial methods were the subject of multiple lawsuits for mental damages in the US during the 1980s. Korshunova attended training sessions with a friend, Ukrainian model Anastasia Drozdova, who committed suicide under similar circumstances in 2009. Friends of the two women reported changes in behaviour after several months at the Rose. Korshunova became aggressive, while Drozdova experienced violent mood swings and grew reclusive; both lost weight. After three months of training, Korshunova returned to New York to look for work, where she wrote of feeling lost and doubting herself. Rick Ross, head of the Cult Education Forum, argues that organisations such as Rose of the World \\"work like drugs: giving you peak experiences, their adherents always coming back for more. The serious problems start when people leave. The trainings have become their lives‚Äîthey come back to emptiness. The sensitive ones break.\\" Only months after leaving the Rose, Korshunova was found dead.

According to Igor Grabar, Lazarev \\"led Arbat and Prechistenka neighborhoods into the new century\\" - his 1900s buildings concentrated in these upper-class areas. Biography=Lazarev practice Nikita Lazarev was born into an old wealthy family of Armenian descent; his ancestor, Ovakim Lazarev, founded the historical Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages (its building currently houses Embassy of Armenia) according to the will of his brother Ivan Lazarevich Lazarev. Nikita graduated from the Institute of Civil Engineers and operated as a partner in Lazarev and Strotter construction company. Buildings of his own design prior to 1906 were typical Moscow Moderne version of Art Nouveau - never reaching the level of Lev Kekushev or Fyodor Schechtel. However, his turn to Neoclassicism produced a landmark, Mindovsky House. Mindovsky House Mindovsky family originated in Kineshma, where serf Ivan Ivanovich Mindovsky (1781‚Äì1853) launched his own textile mill. His grandson, Ivan Alexandrovich, commissioned the first historical Mindovsky House to Lev Kekushev (44, Povarskaya Street). Next of kin, Nikolay Ivanovich, commissioned the second Mindovsky House to Nikita Lazarev. Various members of the clan also owned apartment blocks in the city (including 9, Vspolny Lane by Fyodor Schechtel). Lazarev's Mindovsky House became a statement of neoclassical reaction against \\"decadent art\\". It stands next to two William Walcot's Art Nouveau mansions, on a strategic corner lot visible from Prechictenka Street. In 1927-1938 the building housed Embassy of Austria. After the Anschluss of 1938, it was used as an exclusive hotel, housing guests like Joachim von Ribbentrop (August 1939) and Winston Churchill (October 1944). However, the rumour that Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed there is an urban legend . In April, 1955 the building became Austrian Embassy again. Mindovsky House is also known as the site of a fictional shooting in Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak. Private life Nikita Lazarev's niece was married to Ivan Zholtovsky, however, two architects didn't get along too well (Belyutin). Lazarev, a member of an old a prolific family, was also related to Wassily Kandinsky and other artists. A sportsman and driving enthusiast, he was the active member of upper-class Moscow Automobile Society before 1917. He was also a member of Valery Bryusov's Literary Arts Circle (as well as Fyodor Schechtel. Lazarev's life after 1917 is scarcely documented; he remained in Soviet Moscow, lost his practice but retained a decent standard of living (Belyutin). His son, professor Viktor Nikitich Lazarev, was a prominent historian of Byzantium. He was admitted to the Soviet Academy of Sciences together with Igor Grabar, a long-time friend of Lazarevs; neither Lazarev, nor Grabar ever were in the Communist Party.

It saw great advancements in the visual arts, music, literature, and philosophy. Officials of the ruling bureaucracy, who underwent a strict and extensive examination process, reached new heights of education in Chinese society, while general Chinese culture was enhanced by widespread printing, growing literacy, and various arts. Appreciation of art among the gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, especially in regard to paintings, which is an art practiced by many. Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably shifted from the Northern (960‚Äì1127) to Southern Song (1127‚Äì1279) periods, influenced in part by the gradual embrace of the Neo-Confucian political ideology at court. People in urban areas enjoyed theatrical drama on stage, restaurants that catered to a variety of regional cooking, lavish clothing and apparel sold in the markets, while both urban and rural people engaged in seasonal festivities and religious holidays. Visual arts Anonymous painting of Cai Wenji and her Xiongnu husband (Zuoxianwang) dating from the Southern Song. Chinese painting during the Song dynasty reached a new level of sophistication with further development of landscape painting. The shan shui style painting‚Äî\\"shan\\" meaning mountain, and \\"shui\\" meaning river‚Äîbecame prominent features in Chinese landscape art. The emphasis laid upon landscape painting in the Song period was grounded in Chinese philosophy; Taoism stressed that humans were but tiny specks amongst vast and greater cosmos, while Neo-Confucianist writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 162. The making of glazed and translucent porcelain and celadon wares with complex use of enamels was also developed further during the Song period. Longquan celadon wares were particularly popular in the Song period. Black and red lacquerwares of the Song period featured beautifully carved artwork of miniature nature scenes, landscapes, or simple decorative motifs. However, even though intricate bronze-casting, ceramics and lacquerware, jade carving, sculpture, architecture, and the painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem by the Song Chinese, landscape painting was paramount.Morton, 104. By the beginning of the Song dynasty a distinctive landscape style had emerged.Barnhart, \\"Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting\\", 93. Artists mastered the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground, while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space. Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds and mist, while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground.Morton, 105. Song ding ware porcelain bottle, 11th century. There was a significant difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960‚Äì1127) and Southern Song period (1127‚Äì1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 163. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.Walton, 199. phoenix-headed spout, gray sandstone with celadon coating, 10th century. Ever since the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420‚Äì589), painting had become an art of high sophistication that was associated with the gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry.Ebrey, 81‚Äì83. During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037‚Äì1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051‚Äì1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed.Ebrey, 163. The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting. Although they were avid art collectors, some Song scholars did not readily appreciate artworks commissioned by those painters found at shops or common marketplaces, and some of the scholars even criticized artists from renowned schools and academies. Anthony J. Barbieri- Low, a Professor of Early Chinese History at the University of California, Santa Barbara, points out that Song scholars' appreciation of art created by their peers was not extended to those who made a living simply as professional artists:Barbieri-Low (2007), 39‚Äì40. > During the Northern Song (960‚Äì1126 CE), a new class of scholar-artists > emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy painters > nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's > painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize > these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid > commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or > self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who > concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, > worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better > than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered > real artists. However, during the Song period, there were many acclaimed court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal family. One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was Zhang Zeduan (1085‚Äì1145), who painted the original Along the River During Qingming Festival scroll, one of the most well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art. Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127‚Äì1162) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, based on the woman poet Cai Wenji (177‚Äì250 AD) of the earlier Han dynasty. The Southern Song dynasty court painters included Zhao Mengjian (Ë∂ôÂ≠üÂ†Ö, c. 1199‚Äì1264), a member of the Imperial family, known for popularising the Three Friends of Winter. During the Song period Buddhism saw a small revival since its persecution during the Tang dynasty. This could be seen in the continued construction of sculpture artwork at the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan province. Similar in design to the sculptures at Dazu, the Song temple at Mingshan in Anyue, Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era Buddhist sculptures, including the Buddha and deities clad in lavish imperial and monastic robes.Sorensen, 282‚Äì283.

Although the earlier Tang dynasty is viewed as the zenith era for Chinese poetry (particularly the shi style poetry of Du Fu, Li Bai, Bai Juyi), there were important poetic developments by famous poets of the Song era, with the flourishing of the ci form being especially being associated with Song poetry. Song developments in poetry included the works of the social critic and pioneer of the \\"new subjective style\\" Mei Yaochen (1002‚Äì1060), the politically controversial yet renowned master Su Shi (1037‚Äì1101), the eccentric yet brilliant Mi Fu (1051‚Äì1107), the premier Chinese female poet Li Qingzhao (1084‚Äì1151), and many others. Although having roots in the Liang dynasty (502‚Äì557 AD), and further development during the brief existence of the Southern Tang immediate preceding the Song, the ci form of Chinese poetry found its greatest acceptance and popularity during the Song dynasty, and was used by most Song poets. The high court Chancellor Fan Zhongyan (989‚Äì1052), ardent Neo-Confucian Ouyang Xiu (1007‚Äì1072), the great calligrapher Huang Tingjian (1045‚Äì1105), and the military general Xin Qiji (1140‚Äì1207) were especially known for their ci poetry, amongst many others. The great ci poet Li Yu (who ruled the Southern Tang under the name Li Houzhu) wrote some of his most famous works during his time as a prisoner at the first Song court, following the demise of his former kingdom: Li Yu is an important transitional figure, sometimes considered to be the first major Song poet, and sometimes acclaimed as the last major Tang poet. Historiography in literature remained prominent during the Song, as it had in previous ages and would in successive ages of China. Along with Song Qi, the essayist and historian Ouyang Xiu were responsible for compiling the New Book of Tang by 1060, covering the history of the Tang dynasty. Chancellor Sima Guang (1019‚Äì1086), the political nemesis of Wang Anshi (1021‚Äì1086), was responsible for heading a team of scholars that compiled the enormous historical work of the Zizhi Tongjian, a universal history completed in 1084 AD with a total of over 3 million written Chinese characters in 294 volumes.Pratt & Rutt, 478. It covered the major themes and intricate nuances of Chinese history from 425 BC during the Warring States all the way up to the 10th century and the fall of the Tang.Brownlee, 19. In 1189 it was compiled and condensed into fifty-nine books by Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200), while this project was totally complete with the efforts of his disciples around the time of his death in 1200.Partington, 238. A butterfly and wisteria flowers, by X√º Xi (c. 886 ‚Äì c. 975), painted around 970 Funerary vase and cover, stoneware in the Longquan celadon style; from Zhejiang province, Northern Song era, 10th or 11th century. There were also very large encyclopedic works written in the Song period, such as the Four Great Books of Song compiled first by Li Fang in the 10th century and fully edited by the time of Cefu Yuangui in the 11th century. The largest of these was the 1013 publication of the Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau, a massive encyclopedia consisting of 9.4 million written Chinese characters divided into 1000 volumes. There were also rhyme dictionaries written during the Song dynasty, such as the Jiyun of 1037. Although Neo-Confucianism became dominant over Buddhism in China during this period, there was still a significant amount of Buddhist literature. For example, there was the collection of Zen Buddhist k≈çans in the Blue Cliff Record of 1125, which was expanded by Yuanwu Keqin (1063‚Äì1135). 'Travel record literature' ('youji wenxue') was also a popular category of literature during the Song period, which was accounts of one's own travel experiences typically written in narrative or prose styles, and included authors such as Fan Chengda (1126‚Äì1193).Hargett, 67‚Äì68. A great example of Chinese travel literature in the Song period would be Su Shi's (1037‚Äì1101) Record of Stone Bell Mountain. There were many technical and scientific writings during the Song period. The two most eminent authors of the scientific and technical fields were Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095) and his contemporary Su Song (1020‚Äì1101). Shen Kuo published his Dream Pool Essays in 1088 AD, an enormous encyclopedic book that covered a wide range of subjects, including literature, art, military strategy, mathematics, astronomy, meteorology, geology, geography, metallurgy, engineering, hydraulics, architecture, zoology, botany, agronomy, medicine, anthropology, archeology, and more.Needham, Volume 1, 136. As for Shen Kuo's equally brilliant peer, Su Song created a celestial atlas of five different star maps, wrote the 1070 AD pharmaceutical treatise of the Ben Cao Tu Jing (Illustrated Pharmacopoeia), which had the related subjects of botany, zoology, metallurgy, and mineralogy, and wrote his famous horological treatise of the Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao in 1092 AD, which described in full detail his ingenious astronomical clock tower constructed in the capital city of Kaifeng.Sivin, III, 32.Needham, Volume 3, 208 & 278.Wu, 5.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 445‚Äì448.Bodde, 140. Although these two figures were perhaps the greatest technical authors in their field during the time, there were many others. For producing textiles, Qin Guan's book of 1090 AD, the Can Shu (Book of Sericulture), included description of a silk- reeling machine that incorporated the earliest known use of the mechanical belt drive in order to function.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 107‚Äì108. In the literary field of agronomy, there was the Jiu Huang Huo Min Shu (The Rescue of the People; a Treatise on Famine Prevention and Relief) edited by Dong Wei in the 12th century, the Cha Lu (Record of Tea) written by Cai Xiang in 1060 AD, the Zhu Zi Cang Fa (Master Zhu on Managing Communal Granaries) written by Zhu Xi in 1182 AD, and many others.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 621.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 623. There were also great authors of written works pertaining to geography and cartography during the Song, such as Yue Shi (his book in 983), Wang Zhu (in 1051), Li Dechu (in 1080), Chen Kunchen (in 1111), Ouyang Wen (in 1117), and Zhu Mu (in 1240).Needham, Volume 3, 521. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, under the Song.Bol, 44. The major differences between the two were that fangzhi were products of local initiative and decision-making, were typically ten to fifty chapters in length, and were almost always printed for a large audience, whereas tujing were products of infrequent demands from the central government and were typically only four chapters long.Bol, 46. The widespread availability of printing in the Song allowed many ordinary people to access materials that were once read almost exclusively by experts, such as printed texts and handbooks on agriculture, childbirth, pharmacy and medicine, domestic economics, geography, divination, and Taoist rituals.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 158.Hymes, 3. Performing arts \\"A Children's Puppet Show\\" (ÂÇÄÂÑ°Â©¥ÊàèÂõæËΩ¥), a painting by Liu Songnian (ÂàòÊùæÂπ¥ 1174‚Äì1224 AD) A 12th- century painting by Su Hanchen; a girl waves a peacock feather banner like the one used in dramatical theater to signal an acting leader of troops. Theatre and drama in China trace their roots back to the academy of music known as the Pear Garden, founded in the early 8th century during the Tang dynasty. However, historian Stephen H. West asserts that the Northern Song era capital Kaifeng was the first real center where the performing arts became \\"an industry, a conglomerate involving theatre, gambling, prostitution, and food.\\"West, 69. The rise in consumption by merchants and scholar-officials, he states, \\"accelerated the growth of both the performance and the food industries,\\" asserting a direct link between the two due to their close proximity within the cities.West, 69 & 74. Of the fifty-some theatres located in the 'pleasure districts' of Kaifeng, four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon.West, 76. The chief crowd that gathered was composed of those from the merchant class, while government officials only went to restaurants and attended theatre performances during holidays.West, 98. From Kaifeng, the zaju dramatic style employed the beiqu style of poetic lyrics. After the capital had shifted to Hangzhou, the dramatic style of xiwen (also nanxi or nanqu) developed separately.West, 69‚Äì70. These two different regional genres of musical drama used different regional dialects of speech, recitation, and dialogue, entailed their own unique sets of role types (juese), and employed different types of musical instruments playing different tunes.West, 70. In Kaifeng drama, one singer was preferred for each play, accompanied by string and percussion instruments. In Hangzhou drama, there was a multitude of singers on stage for each set, while string and wind instruments were preferred. Color and clothing distinguished the rank of theatre actors in the Song.Gernet, 223. Similar to vendors who wore specific outfits to identify which guild they belonged to, actors' generic costumes reflected the role type they played on stage, whether it be student, young man, young woman, official, soldier, etc. Actors honed their theatrical skills at drama schools. Musicians also found work in the theatre industry, since plays performed in the markets were often accompanied by music. Actors on stage always spoke their lines in Classical Chinese; vernacular Chinese that imitated the common spoken language was not introduced into theatrical performances until the Yuan dynasty.Rossabi, 162. Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language, acting troupes commonly drew their membership from one of the lowest classes in society: prostitutes.West, 72. Themes enjoyed in stage skits varied from satires about corrupt officials to comedy acts with titles like \\"Setting fire when delivering the soup,\\" \\"Raising a ruckus in the winehouse,\\" \\"The peony smells best when the wine is stolen,\\" and \\"Catching a monkey in a restaurant.\\"West, 78‚Äì79.Gernet, 224. The only xiwen play to have survived from the Southern Song era is the Zhang Xie zhuang yuan (Âº†ÂçîÁãÄÂÖÉ), featuring interludes such as a clown stealing food and wine at a wedding banquet in act 16 and a quick comedy sketch about renting a room in act 24.West, 79. Surprisingly, actors on stage did not have a wholesale monopoly on theatrical entertainment, as even vendors and peddlers in the street, singing lewd songs and beating on whatever they could find to compensate for percussion instruments, could draw crowds.West, 83‚Äì85 This practice was so widespread that West claims \\"the city itself was turned into a stage and the citizens into the essential audience.\\"West, 85. Many of the songs played for stage performances were tunes that originated from vendors' and peddlers' songs.West, 91. Contests were held on New Year's Day to determine which vendor or peddler had the best chants and songs while selling wares; the winners were brought before the imperial court to perform. The Wulin jiushi of the Southern Song states that these vendors, when presented to the consorts and concubines of the palace, were lavished with heaps of gold and pearls for their wares; some vendors would \\"become rich in a single evening.\\" Theatrical stunts were also performed to gain attention, such as fried-glutinous-rice-ball vendors hanging small red lamps on portable bamboo racks who would twirl them around to the beat of a drum to dazzle crowds.West, 86. Puppet shows in the streets and wards were also popular.West, 87. Festivities A small section of the Qingming Shang He Tu (Along the River During Qingming Festival), a large horizontal scroll painting by Zhang Zeduan (1085‚Äì1145) In ancient China, there were many domestic and public pleasures in the rich urban environment unique to the Song dynasty. For the austere and hardworking peasantry, annual festivals and holidays provided a time of joy and relaxation, and for the poorest it meant a chance to borrow food and alcoholic drink so that everyone could join in the celebration. People would gather around their local sanctuary to observe the festival's games, theatrical entertainments, juggling, clowning, and other performances.Gernet, 106. The festivities on New Years were considered the most important of the year by the Chinese, its momentous occasion correlating with the beginning of February on the Western calendar. Preparations for the New Years festival took place over a month's time, as people busied themselves painting door gods, crafting paper streamers with lucky characters for \\"welcoming the spring,\\" making printed images of Zhong Kui, and cooking special kinds of foods such as porridge of red haricot beans.Gernet, 186. The widely popular Lantern Festival was held every 15th day of 1st lunar month. According to the literatus and official Zhou Mi (1232‚Äì1298 AD), during the Xiao-Zong period (1163‚Äì1189 AD) the best lantern festivals were held at Suzhou and Fuzhou, while Hangzhou was also known for its great variety of colorful paper lanterns, in all shapes and sizes.Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 128. Meng Yuanlao (active 1126‚Äì1147) recalled in Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital) how the earlier Northern Song capital at Kaifeng would host festivals with tens of thousands of colorful and brightly lit paper lanterns hoisted on long poles up and down the main street, the poles also wrapped in colorful silk with numerous dramatic paper figures flying in the wind like fairies. There were also other venerated holidays, such as the Qingming Festival, as it was supposedly this period of the year that was depicted in the artwork (mentioned above) by the artist Zhang Zeduan (although some would argue the painting actually represented the time of autumn in the year). A half-section of the 12th-century Song remake of the Night Revels of Han Xizai, original by Gu Hongzhong;Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 148. the female musicians in the center of the image are playing transverse bamboo flutes and guan, and the male musician is playing a wooden clapper called paiban. With the advent of the discovery of gunpowder in China, lavish fireworks displays could also be held during festivities. For example, the martial demonstration in 1110 AD to entertain the court of Emperor Huizong, when it was recorded that a large fireworks display was held alongside Chinese dancers in strange costumes moving through clouds of colored smoke in their performance.Kelly, 2. The common people also purchased firecrackers from city shopkeepers and vendors, made of simple sticks of bamboo filled with a small amount of gunpowder. Although they were discontinued after the devastation of the Anshi Rebellion (755‚Äì763) during the Tang dynasty, lavish Chinese carnivals were revived and once again celebrated during the Song dynasty.Benn, 157. Chinese carnival celebrations were held nationwide when the emperor felt a great occasion warranted a grand display of his benevolence and generosity, such as renowned military victories, abundant harvests after long droughts or famines, the granting of grand amnesties by the throne, sacrifices to deities, the installation of a crown prince, marriages within the imperial family, etc.Benn, 154‚Äì155. Clothing and apparel A painting of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, showing the long robes and official headgear of the emperor. This type of headgear, along with the headgear of officials and merchants, was made of black-colored silk. There were many types of clothing and different clothing trends in the Song period, yet clothes in China were always modeled after the seasons and as outward symbols of one's social class. Coal used for heating one's home was scarce and often expensive, so people often wore clothing with extra silk-floss and fur-lined coats in the winter.Gernet, 127. The clothing material preferred by the rich was silk, and for special occasions they had silk robes with gold brocade. The clothing material used by the poor was often hempen cloth, but cotton clothes were also used, the latter being most widely available in the south. The types of clothes worn by peasants and commoners were largely uniform in appearance (with color standard of black and white),Gernet, 128. and so was the case for the upper class and elite. In fact, wealthy and leading members of society followed accepted guidelines and ritual requirements for clothing. In the upper class, each stratified grade in the social hierarchy was distinguished by the color and specific ornamentation of robes, the shape and type of headgear, and even the style of girdle worn.Gernet, 127‚Äì128. This rigid order was especially so during the beginning of the dynasty. However, the lines of hierarchy slowly began to blur as the color purple, once reserved solely for the attire of third rank officials or higher, began to diffuse amongst all ranks of officials who bore the color indiscriminately. Along with lower grade civil officials in the government protesting the rigid regulations for attire, the wealthy members of the merchant class also contributed to the disintegration of rules for ceremonial attire worn only by certain members of society.Gernet, 129. Yet there were still visible distinctions between civil officials and the class of rich merchants and business owners; the officials were distinguished by their long robes reaching to the ground, while merchants often wore a blouse that came down below the waist with trousers. Pants and trousers were introduced to China during the Warring States in the 4th century BC, and were not exclusive to merchants;Gernet, 130. every soldier wore trousers as part of his uniform, while trousers were also worn by the common people. Although most men were cleanshaven, soldiers, military officers, and professional boxing champions preferred side-whiskers and goatee beards, as they were a sign of virility.Gernet, 131. The attire of Song women was distinguished from men's clothing by being fastened on the left, not on the right. Women wore long dresses or blouses that came down almost to the knee. They also wore skirts and jackets with short or long sleeves. When strolling about outside and along the road, women of wealthy means chose to wear square purple scarves around their shoulders. Ladies also wore hairpins and combs in their hair, while princesses, imperial concubines, and the wives of officials and wealthy merchants wore head ornaments of gold and silver that were shaped in the form of phoenixes and flowers. People in the Song dynasty never left their homes barefoot, and always had some sort of headgear on. Shops in the city specialized in certain types of hats and headgear, including caps with pointed tails, as well as belts and waistwraps.West, 71. Only Buddhist monks shaved their heads and strolled about with no headgear or hat of any sort to cover their heads. For footwear, people could purchase leather shoes called 'oiled footwear', wooden sandals, hempen sandals, and the more expensive satin slippers. Food and cuisine Dried jujubes such as these were imported to Song China from South Asia and the Middle East. An official from Canton was invited to the home of an Arab merchant, and described the jujube as thus: \\"This fruit is the color of sugar, its skin and its pulp are sweet, and it gives the impression, when you eat it, of having first been cooked in the oven and then allowed to dry.\\" From the Song period, works such as Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital) preserve lists of names for entr√©es and food dishes in customer menus for restaurants and taverns, as well as for feasts at banquets, festivals and carnivals, and modest dining. Many of the peculiar names for these dishes do not provide clues as to what types of food ingredients were used. However, judging from the listed seasonings they used for these dishes, such as pepper, ginger, soya sauce, oil, salt, and vinegar, Song era cuisine is perhaps not too different from the Chinese cuisine of today.Gernet, 133. Other additional seasonings and ingredients included walnuts, turnips, crushed Chinese cardamon kernels, fagara, olives, ginkgo nuts, citrus zest, and sesame oil.West, 73, footnote 17. Regional differences in culture brought about different types of foods, while in certain areas the cooking traditions of regional cultures blended together; such was the case of the Southern Song capital at Hangzhou. After the mass exodus from the north, people brought Henan-style cooking and foods (popular in the previous Northern Song capital at Kaifeng) to Hangzhou, which was blended with the cooking traditions of Zhejiang. However, records indicate that already in the Northern Song period, the first capital at Kaifeng sported restaurants that served southern Chinese cuisine. This catered to capital officials whose native provinces were in the southeast, and would have found northern cuisine lacking in sufficient seasoning for their tastes. In fact, texts from the Song era provide the first use of the phrases nanshi, beishi, and chuanfan to refer specifically to northern, southern, and Sichuan cooking, respectively. Many restaurants were known for their specialties; for example, there was one restaurant in Hangzhou that served only iced foods, while some restaurants catered to those who wanted either hot, warm, room temperature, or cold foods.West, 93. Descendants of those from Kaifeng owned most of the restaurants found in Hangzhou,Gernet, 133‚Äì134 but many other regional varieties in foodstuffs and cooking were sponsored by restaurants. This included restaurants catering Sichuan cuisine that emphasized use of pepper, dishes and beverages from Hebei and Shandong, and coastal foods of shrimp and saltwater fish.Gernet, 134. The memory and patience of waiters had to be keen; in the larger restaurants, serving dinner parties that required twenty or so dishes became a hassle if even a slight error occurred. If a guest reported the mistake of a waiter to the head of the restaurant, the waiter could be verbally reprimanded, have his salary docked, or in extreme cases, kicked out of the establishment for good. A Chinese painting of an outdoor banquet, a Song dynasty painting and possible remake of a Tang dynasty original. In the early morning in Hangzhou, along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, special breakfast items and delicacies were sold.Gernet, 183‚Äì184 This included fried tripe, pieces of mutton or goose, soups of various kinds, hot pancakes, steamed pancakes, and iced cakes. Noodle shops were also popular, and remained open all day and night along the Imperial Way.Gernet, 184. According to one Song source on Kaifeng, the night markets closed at the third night watch but reopened on the fifth, while they had also gained a reputation for staying open during winter storms and the darkest, rainiest days of winter. There were also some exotic foreign foods imported to China from abroad, including raisins, dates, Persian jujubes, and grape wine; rice wine was more common in China, a fact noted even by the 13th century Venetian traveler Marco Polo.Gernet, 134‚Äì135. Although grape-based wine had been known in China since the ancient Han dynasty Chinese ventured into Hellenistic Central Asia, grape- wine was often reserved for the elite. Besides wine, other beverages included pear juice, lychee fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, tea, and pawpaw juice.Gernet, 138.Gernet, 184‚Äì185. Dairy products and farming were foreign concepts to the Chinese, which explains the absence of cheese and milk in their diet.Gernet, 135. Beef was also rarely eaten, since the bull was an important draft animal. The main diet of the lower classes remained rice, pork, and salted fish, while it is known from restaurant dinner menus that the upper classes did not eat dog meat. The rich are known to have consumed an array of different meats, such as chicken, shellfish, fallow deer, hares, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others.Gernet, 137. Local freshwater fish from the nearby lake and river were also caught and brought to market, while the West Lake provided geese and duck as well.Gernet, 136. Common fruits that were consumed included melons, pomegranates, lychees, longans, golden oranges, jujubes, Chinese and Japanese quinces, apricots and pears; in the region around Hangzhou alone, there were eleven kinds of apricots and eight different kinds of pears that were produced.West, 73‚Äì74. Specialties and combination dishes in the Song period included scented shellfish cooked in rice-wine, geese with apricots, lotus- seed soup, spicy soup with mussels and fish cooked with plums, sweet soya soup, baked sesame buns stuffed with either sour bean filling or pork tenderloin, mixed vegetable buns, fragrant candied fruit, strips of ginger and fermented beanpaste, jujube-stuffed steamed dumplings, fried chestnuts, salted fermented bean soup, fruit cooked in scented honey, and 'honey crisps' of kneaded and baked honey, flour, mutton fat and pork lard.West, 73.Rossabi, 78.West, 75.West, 75, footnote 25. Dessert molds of oiled flour and sugared honey were shaped into girls' faces or statuettes of soldiers with full armor like door guards, and were called \\"likeness foods\\" (guoshi).West, 89. Philosophy A wooden Bodhisattva statue from the Song dynasty Song intellectuals sought answers to all philosophical and political questions in the Confucian Classics. This renewed interest in the Confucian ideals and society of ancient times coincided with the decline of Buddhism, which was then largely regarded as foreign, and as offering few solutions for practical problems. However, Buddhism in this period continued as a cultural underlay to the more accepted Confucianism and even Taoism, both seen as native and pure by conservative Neo-Confucians. The continuing popularity of Buddhism can be seen with strong evidence by achievements in the arts, such as the 100 painting set of the Five Hundred Luohan, completed by Lin Tinggui and Zhou Jichang in 1178. The conservative Confucian movement could be seen before the likes of Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200), with staunch anti-Buddhists such as Ouyang Xiu (1007‚Äì1072). In his written work of the Ben-lun, he wrote of his theory for how Buddhism had so easily penetrated Chinese culture during the earlier Southern and Northern Dynasties period. He argued that Buddhism became widely accepted when China's traditional institutions were weakened at the time. This was due to many factors, such as foreign Xianbei ruling over the north, and China's political schism that caused warfare and other ills. Although Emperor Wen of Sui (r. 581‚Äì604) abolished the Nine Ranks in favor of a Confucian- taught bureaucracy drafted through civil service examinations, he also heavily sponsored the popular ideology of Buddhism to legitimate his rule. Hence, it was given free rein and influence to flourish and dominate Chinese culture during the Sui and Tang periods; historian Arthur F. Wright describes Confucianism in this period as being reverted to a state of \\"stale archaism\\".Wright, 92. Ouyang Xiu wrote: > \\"This curse [Buddhism] has overspread the empire for a thousand years, and > what can one man in one day do about it? The people are drunk with it, and > it has entered the marrow of their bones; it is surely not to be overcome by > eloquent talk. What, then, is to be done?Wright, 88. Portrait of the Chinese Zen Buddhist Wuzhun Shifan, painted in 1238 AD. In conclusion on how to root out the 'evil' that was Buddhism, Ouyang Xiu presented a historical example of how it could be uprooted from Chinese culture: > Of old, in the time of the Warring States, Yang Zhu and Mo Di were engaged > in violent controversy. Mencius deplored this and devoted himself to > teaching benevolence and righteousness. His exposition of benevolence and > righteousness won the day, and the teachings of Mo Di and Yang Zhu were > extirpated. In Han times the myriad schools of thought all flourished > together. Tung Chung-shu deplored this and revived Confucianism. Therefore > the Way of Confucius shone forth, and the myriad schools expired. This is > the effect of what I have called \\"correcting the root cause in order to > overcome the evil\\".Wright, 89. Although Confucianism was cast in stark contrast to the perceived alien and morally inept Buddhism by those such as Ouyang Xiu, Confucianism nonetheless borrowed ideals of Buddhism to provide for its own revival. From Mahayana Buddhism, the Bodhisattva ideal of ethical universalism with benevolent charity and relief to those in need inspired those such as Fan Zhongyan and Wang Anshi, along with the Song government.Wright, 93. In contrast to the earlier heavily Buddhist Tang period, where wealthy and pious Buddhist families and Buddhist temples handled much of the charity and alms to the poor, the Song government took on this ideal role instead, through its various programs of welfare and charity (refer to Society section).Wright, 93‚Äì94. In addition, the historian Arthur F. Wright notes this situation during the Song period, with philosophical nativism taking from Buddhism its earlier benevolent role: > It is true that Buddhist monks were given official appointments as managers > of many of these enterprises, but the initiative came from Neo-Confucian > officials. In a sense the Buddhist idea of compassion and many of the > measures developed for its practical expression had been appropriated by the > Chinese state.Wright, 94. A seated lion statue, celadon, from Yaozhou, Shaanxi, 11th to 12th century Although Buddhism lost its prominence in the elite circles and government sponsorships of Chinese society, this did not mean the disappearance of Buddhism from Chinese culture. Zen Buddhism continued to flourish during the Song period, as Emperor Lizong of Song had the monk Wuzhun Shifan share the Ch√°n (Zen) doctrine with the imperial court. Much like the Eastern Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate promoting Roman paganism and Theurgy amongst the leading members of Roman society while pushing Christianity's influence into the lower classes, so too did Neo-Confucians of the 13th century succeed in driving Buddhism out of the higher echelons of Chinese society.Brown, 93. In terms of Buddhist metaphysics, Zhou Dunyi influenced the beliefs and teachings of Northern Song-era Confucian scholars such as Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi (who were brothers), and was a major influence for Zhu Xi, one of the leading architects of Neo-Confucianism. They emphasized moral self-cultivation over service to the ruler of the state (healing society's ills from the bottom-up, not the top-down), as opposed to statesmen like Fan Zhongyan or Su Shi, who pursued their agenda to advise the ruler to make the best decisions for the common good of all.Ebrey et al., 168. The Cheng brothers also taught that the workings of nature and metaphysics could be taught through the principle (li) and the vital energy (qi). The principle of nature could be moral or physical, such as the principle of marriage being moral, while the principle of trees is physical. Yet for principles to exist and function normally, there would have to be substance as well as vital energy. This allowed Song intellectuals to validate the teachings of Mencius on the innate goodness of human nature, while at the same time providing an explanation for human wrongdoing. In essence, the principle underlying a human being is good and benevolent, but vital energy has the potential to go astray and be corrupted, giving rise to selfish impulses and all other negative human traits. luohan and one attendant, by Lin Tinggui, 1178 AD The Song Neo-Confucian philosophers, finding a certain purity in the originality of the ancient classical texts, wrote commentaries on them. The most influential of these philosophers was Zhu Xi, whose synthesis of Confucian thought and Buddhist, Taoist, and other ideas became the official imperial ideology from late Song times to the late 19th century. The basis of his teaching was influenced by the Cheng brothers, but he greatly extended their teachings, forming the core of Neo-Confucianism. This included emphasis on the Four Books: the Analects, Mencius, Doctrine of the Mean, and the Great Learning (the latter two being chapters in the ancient Book of Rites). His viewpoint was that improvement of the world began with improvement of the mind, as outlined in the Great Learning.Ebrey et al., 169. His approach to Confucianism was shunned by his contemporaries, as his writings were forbidden to be cited by students taking the Imperial Examinations. However, Emperor Lizong of Song found his writing to be intriguing, reversing the policy against him, and making it a requirement for students to study his commentaries on the Four Books.

The color engine, which was released by Ocean Thin Films in 2005, is designed to fit into the Source Four lighting instrument made by Electronic Theatre Controls. SeaChanger Introduces Wash Color Engine Technology The SeaChanger Color Engine is designed to fit between the reflector assembly and lens barrel of a Source Four ellipsoidal, replacing the gobo slot and accessory slot. It is designed to be installed without tools. The unit is available in profile and wash versions. The profile model uses the lens barrel and reflector assembly of a Source Four, while the wash model uses only the reflector assembly. The manufacturer provides a lens assembly for the wash unit. There is also a high-intensity discharge lamp (HID) model available wherein only the lens barrel from the Source Four is used in the profile fixture. The wash version of the HID fixture is a completely stand alone unit, not using Source Four components at all, although the same color engine technology is used. The color engine contains integral power supply and communication interface. The unit mounts between the lamp housing and the barrel assembly of a Source Four fixture, meaning that it is placed directly in front of the source, or lamp and before any optics or beam shaping devices. Inside the unit, four micro-lithographed dichroic filters are gradually saturated from 0-95%. The optional Studio Dichroic color filters are gradually saturated from 0-100%.

It was constructed in 1909 as the first purpose-built synagogue on the Iron Range. It served as the heart of the local Jewish community in the early 20th century. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for its local significance in the themes of religion and social history. It was nominated for attesting both to the ethnic diversity of the Iron Range and to the commonality of its immigrant groups maintaining cohesion around religious centers. With A declining congregation forced the synagogue to close its doors in the mid-1990s. However, community support and renovations have preserved B'nai Abraham as a museum and cultural center. Background Virginia became a hub of lumber and mining industry in the 1890s. Jewish merchants and clerks soon settled in the newly established town. In 1894, Jews from Virginia and nearby communities began to hold religious services in Virginia's old North Pole Hall. Most of Virginia's Jewish population were immigrants from an area of the Russian Empire that is now Lithuania. As the town boomed, so too did its Jewish population. Members of Virginia's growing Jewish community founded the congregation of B'nai Abraham in 1905. They held their first meeting in Virginia's Socialist Opera House on November 20. Their first goal was the construction of a synagogue. Other Iron Range synagogues in Hibbing and Eveleth were converted churches. B'nai Abraham was the first synagogue to be built on the Range. Origin and use The women of the congregation formed the B'nai Abraham Ladies' Aid Society in 1908. They began to raise funds for the construction of a synagogue and were very successful. Among their contributions to the building effort was the donation of $700 () to purchase one of B'nai Abraham's 13 stained glass windows. The Ladies' Aid Society continued long after the synagogue's construction was complete. The group of women called themselves the Sunshine Club. They visited sick members of the congregation, hosted community events, and assisted new Jewish immigrants in the area. The synagogue served as the heart of Virginia's tightly interwoven Jewish community. Visiting rabbis conducted services. Holidays and Bar Mitzvahs were celebrated in the synagogue. B'nai Abraham was also used as a gathering place for weddings, birthdays, and retirements. The synagogue served as a meeting place for the Virginia chapters of several Jewish organizations including B'nai B'rith and Hadassah. The synagogue's distinctive stone foundation, windows, Romanesque style, and red brick exterior make B'nai Abraham one of Virginia's most recognizable landmarks. In 1980 B'nai Abraham was the first Minnesota synagogue to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Decline and restoration During the second half of the twentieth century, the Jewish population on the Iron Range declined. Falling membership had the forced the closure of synagogues in Hibbing, Chisholm, and Eveleth. By 1990 B'nai Abraham was the last synagogue on the Iron Range. In the mid-1990s B'nai Abraham also closed its doors. By 2002 the congregation had declined to two members. That year the building was listed as one of the most threatened historic structures in Minnesota. In 2004 a nonprofit organization, the Friends of B'nai Abraham, formed to save the building. They acquired it from its previous owners and began to restore the historic building with the help of state and local grants as well as donations. The building reopened in the summer of 2008, and is jointly managed by the Friends organization and the Virginia Area Historical Society. It is used as a cultural center and museum and includes a permanent exhibit documenting the history of Jewish settlement on the Iron Range.

To solve the problems with increased traffic, the railway companies had the choice of either building double track or hauling longer trains. The latter solution was chosen, and on the Norwegian side the ten El 3 locomotives were converted from five double sets to three triple sets with one reserve and the two El 4 converted to a double set. But this solution would require more locomotives. The Swedish State Railways (SJ), who operated the trains from the mines to Riksgr√§nsen, chose to buy 12 Dm units in 1952, based on the Da units from 1950.

Movable print, improved seeds for rice and other commercial crops, gunpowder, water-powered mechanical clocks, the use of coal as a source of fuel for a variety of industries, improved techniques for iron and steel production, pound locks and many other technological innovations transformed the economy. In north China, the main fuel source for ceramic kilns and iron furnaces shifted from wood to coal. This made the job a lot faster because coal burns quicker. During the Song dynasty, there was also a notable increase in commercial contacts with global markets. Merchants engaged in overseas trade through investments in trading vessels and trade which reached ports as far away as East Africa. This period also witnessed the development of the world's first banknote, or printed paper money (see Jiaozi, Guanzi, Huizi), which circulated on a massive scale. Combined with a unified tax system and efficient trade routes by road and canal, this meant the development of a truly nationwide market. Regional specialization promoted economic efficiency and increased productivity. Although much of the central government's treasury went to the military, taxes imposed on the rising commercial base refilled the coffers and further encouraged the monetary economy.Ebrey, 167. Reformers and conservatives debated the role of government in the economy. The emperor and his government still took responsibility for the economy, but generally made fewer claims than in earlier dynasties. The government did, however, continue to enforce monopolies on certain manufactured items and market goods to boost revenues and secure resources that were vital to the empire's security, such as tea, salt, and chemical components for gunpowder. These changes made China a global leader, leading some historians to call this an \\"early modern\\" economy many centuries before Western Europe made its breakthrough. Many of these economic gains were lost, however, in the succeeding Yuan dynasty. Agriculture A Northern Song coin (ËÅñÂÆãÂÖÉÂØ∂) There was a massive expansion of ploughland during the Song dynasty. The government encouraged people to reclaim barren lands and put them under cultivation. Anyone who opened up new lands and paid taxes were granted permanent possession of the new land. Under this policy, the cultivated land in the Song dynasty is estimated to have reached a peak number of 720 million mu, and was not surpassed by later Ming and Qing dynasties.Qi Xia, Economy of the Song Dynasty, Part I, Chapter 1, page 65 /F Irrigation of arable land was also greatly fostered during this period. Prominent statesman and economist Wang Anshi issued the Law and Decree on Irrigation in 1069 that encouraged expansion of the irrigation system in China. By 1076, about 10,800 irrigation projects were completed, which irrigated more than 36 million mu of public and private land.Qi Xia, Economy of the Song Dynasty, p86 Major irrigation projects included dredging the Yellow River at northern China and artificial silt land in the Lake Tai valley. As a result of this policy, crop production in China tripled.Qi Xia, Economy of the Song Dynasty, p84-96 Agricultural yields were about 2 tan (a unit of about ) of grain per mu during the Song dynasty, compared with 1 tan during the early Han and 1.5 tan during the late Tang. The economic development of China under the Song dynasty was marked by improvements in farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers. The Song inherited the plow innovations described in the Tang dynasty text The Classic of the Plow, which documents their utilization in Jiangnan. The Song improved on the Tang curved iron plough and invented a special steel plough design specifically for reclaiming wasteland. The wasteland plough was not made of iron, but of stronger steel, the blade was shorter but thicker, and particularly effective in cutting through reeds and roots in wetlands in the Huai River valley. A tool designed to facilitate seedling called \\"seedling horse\\" was invented under the Song; it was made of jujube wood and paulownia wood. Song farms used bamboo water wheels to harness the flow energy of rivers to raise water for irrigation of farmland. The water wheel was about 30 chi in diameter, with ten bamboo watering tubes fastened at its perimeter. Some farmers even used three stage watering wheels to lift water to a height of over 30 chi. High yield Champa paddy seeds, Korean yellow paddy, Indian green pea, and Middle East watermelon were introduced into China during this period, greatly enhancing the variety of farm produce. Song farmers emphasized the importance of night soil as fertilizer. They understood that using night soil could transform barren wasteland into fertile farmland. Chen Pu wrote in his Book of Agriculture of 1149: \\"The common saying that farmland becomes exhausted after seeding three to five years is not right, if frequently top up with new soil and cure with night soil, then the land becomes more fertile\\".Qi Xia, p135 Economic crops Song dynasty tribute tea, the big dragon cake Cotton was introduced from Hainan Island into central China. Cotton flowers were collected, pits removed, beaten loose with bamboo bows, drawn into yarns and weaved into cloth called \\"jibei\\".\\"Qi Xia, 156 The cotton jibei made in Hainan has great variety, the cloth has great width, often dyed into brilliant colors, stitching up two pieces make a bedspread, stitching four pieces make a curtainZhou Qufei, p228 Hemp was also widely planted and made into linen. Independent mulberry farms flourished in the Mount Dongting region in Suzhou. The mulberry farmers did not make a living on farmland, but instead they grew mulberry trees and bred silkworm to harvest silk. Sugarcane first appeared in China during the Warring States period. During the Song dynasty, Lake Tai valley was famous for the sugarcane cultivated. Song writer Wang Zhuo described in great detail the method of cultivating sugarcane and how to make cane sugar flour from sugarcane in his monography \\"Classic of Sugar\\" in 1154, the first book about sugar technology in China.Ji Xianlin, p124-129 Tea plantation in the Song dynasty was three times the size that it during the Tang dynasty. According to a survey in 1162, tea plantations were spread across 66 prefectures in 244 counties.Qi Xia 856 The Beiyuan Plantation (North Park Plantation) was an imperial tea plantation in Fujian prefecture. It produced more than forty varieties of tribute tea for the imperial court. Only the very tip of tender tea leaves were picked, processed and pressed into tea cakes, embossed with dragon pattern, known as \\"dragon tea cakes\\".Xiong Fan (Song dynasty) Xuanhe Beiyuan Dragon Tea Cakes With the growth of cities, high value vegetable farms sprung up in the suburbs. In southern China, on average one mu of paddy farm land supported one man, while in the north about three mu for one man, while one mu of vegetable farm supported three men.Qi Xia,180 Organization, investment, and trade Chinese cargo ships; Chinese ships of the Song period featured hulls with watertight compartments. During the Song dynasty, the merchant class became more sophisticated, well-respected and organized than in earlier periods of China. Their accumulated wealth often rivaled that of the scholar-officials who administered the affairs of government. For their organizational skills, Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais state that Song merchants: > ...set up partnerships and joint stock companies, with a separation of > owners (shareholders) and managers. In the large cities, merchants were > organized into guilds according to the type of product sold; they > periodically set prices and arranged sales from wholesalers to shop owners. > When the government requisitioned goods or assessed taxes, it dealt with the > guild heads.Ebrey et al., 157. Although large government-run industries and large privately owned enterprises dominated the market system of urban China during the Song period, there was a plethora of small private businesses and entrepreneurs throughout the large suburbs and rural areas that thrived off the economic boom of the period. There was even a large black market in China during the Song period, which was actually enhanced once the Jurchens conquered northern China and established the Jin dynasty. For example, around 1160 AD there was an annual black market smuggling of some 70 to 80 thousand cattle. There were multitudes of successful small kilns and pottery shops owned by local families, along with oil presses, wine-making shops, small local paper-making businesses, etc. There was also room for small economic success with the \\"inn keeper, the petty diviner, the drug seller, the cloth trader\\", and many others.Embree, 339-340. The preceding Tang dynasty saw the development of ho-pen, the earliest form of joint stock company with an active partner and passive investors. By the Song dynasty this had expanded into the douniu, a pool of shareholders with management in the hands of ching-shang, merchants who operated their businesses using investors' funds. A class of merchants specialising as ching- shang formed. Investor compensation was based on profit-sharing, reducing the risk of individual merchants and burdens of interest payment. water-powered mill for grain, along with river transport. Rural families that sold a large agricultural surplus to the market not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 141. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 347. For clothing, silken robes were worn by the wealthy and elite while hemp and ramie was worn by the poor; by the late Song period cotton clothes were also in use. Shipment of all these materials and goods was aided by the 10th century innovation of the canal pound lock in China; the Song scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031-1095) wrote that the building of pound lock gates at Zhenzhou (presumably Kuozhou along the Yangtze) during the 1020s and 1030s freed up the use of five hundred working laborers at the canal each year, amounting to the saving of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash annually.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 352. He wrote that the old method of hauling boats over limited the size of the cargo to 300 tan of rice per vessel (roughly ), but after the pound locks were introduced, boats carrying 400 tan (roughly ) could then be used. Shen wrote that by his time (c. 1080) government boats could carry cargo weights of up to 700 tan (), while private boats could hold as much as 800 bags, each weighing 2 tan (i.e. a total of ). Foreign trade Longquan-ware celadon vase from the 13th century. Sea trade abroad to the South East Pacific, the Hindu world, the Islamic world, and the East African world brought merchants great fortune.Rossabi, 77-78. Although the massive amount of indigenous trade along the Grand Canal, the Yangtze River, its tributaries and lakes, and other canal systems trumped the commercial gains of overseas trade,Fairbank, 89. there were still many large seaports during the Song period that bolstered the economy, such as Quanzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen. These seaports, now heavily connected to the hinterland via canal, lake, and river traffic, acted as a long string of large market centers for the sale of cash crops produced in the interior.Rossabi, 79. The high demand in China for foreign luxury goods and spices coming from the East Indies facilitated the growth of Chinese maritime trade abroad during the Song period.Fairbank, 92. Along with the mining industry, the shipbuilding industry of Fujian province during the Song period increased its production exponentially as maritime trade was given more importance and as the province's population growth began to increase dramatically. The Song capital at Hangzhou had a large canal that connected its waterways directly to the seaport at Mingzhou (modern Ningbo), the center where many of the foreign imported goods were shipped out to the rest of the country.Walton, 89. Despite the installation of fire stations and a large fire fighting force, fires continued to threaten the city of Hangzhou and the various businesses within it.Gernet, 34-37. In safeguarding stored supplies and providing rented space for merchants and shopkeepers to keep their surplus goods safe from city fires, the rich families of Hangzhou, palace eunuchs, and empresses had large warehouses built near the northeast walls; these warehouses were surrounded by channels of water on all sides and were heavily guarded by hired night watchmen.Gernet, 37. Shipbuilders generated means of employment for many skilled craftsmen, while sailors for ship crews found many opportunities of employment as more families had enough capital to purchase boats and invest in commercial trading abroad.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 142. Foreigners and merchants from abroad affected the economy from within China as well. For example, many Muslims went to Song China not only to trade, but dominated the import and export industry and in some cases became officials of economic regulations.BBC article about Islam in ChinaNeedham, Volume 4, Part 3, 465. For Chinese maritime merchants, however, there was risk involved in such long overseas ventures to foreign trade posts and seaports as far away as Egypt.Shen, 158. In order to reduce the risk of losing money instead of gaining it on maritime trade missions abroad: A 10th or 11th century Longquan stoneware vase from Zhejiang province, Song dynasty. > [Song era] investors usually divided their investment among many ships, and > each ship had many investors behind it.

The author Zhu Yu wrote in his Pingzhou Ketan (ËêçÊ¥≤ÂèØË´á; Pingzhou Table Talks) of 1119 AD about the organization, maritime practices, and government standards of seagoing vessels, their merchants, and sailing crews.

Foreign travelers to China often made remarks on the economic strength of the country. The later Muslim Moroccan Berber traveler Ibn Battuta (1304-1377) wrote about many of his travel experiences in places across the Eurasian world, including China at the farthest eastern extremity. After describing lavish Chinese ships holding palatial cabins and saloons, along with the life of Chinese ship crews and captains, Batutta wrote: \\"Among the inhabitants of China there are those who own numerous ships, on which they send their agents to foreign places. For nowhere in the world are there to be found people richer than the Chinese\\".Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 470. Salaries and income Wealthy landholders were still typically those who were able to educate their sons to the highest degree. Hence, small groups of prominent families in any given local county would gain national spotlight for having sons travel far off to be educated and appointed as ministers of the state, but downward social mobility was always an issue with the matter of divided inheritance. Suggesting ways to increase a family's property, Yuan Cai (1140-1190) wrote in the late 12th century that those who obtained office with decent salaries should not convert it to gold and silver but watch their values grow with investment: > For instance, if he had 100,000 strings worth of gold and silver and used > this money to buy productive property, in a year he would gain 10,000 > strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings > and what would be divided among the family would be interest.

Moreover, it could be doubled again in another > three years, ad infinitum.Ebrey et al., 162. Shen Kuo (1031-1095), a minister of finance, was of the same opinion; in his understanding of the velocity of circulation, he stated in 1077: > The utility of money derives from circulation and loan-making. A village of > ten households may have 100,000 coins. If the cash is stored in the > household of one individual, even after a century, the sum remains 100,000. > If the coins are circulated through business transactions so that every > individual of the ten households can enjoy the utility of the 100,000 coins, > then the utility will amount to that of 1,000,000 cash. If circulation > continues without stop, the utility of the cash will be beyond > enumeration.Yang, 47. Considerable scholarship has been concentrated on researching the level of living standards during the Song dynasty. A recent study by economic historian Cheng Minsheng estimated the average income for lower-class laborers during the Song dynasty as 100 wen a day, about 5 times the estimated subsistence level of 20 wen a day and a very high level for preindustrial economies. Per capita consumption of grain and silk respectively was estimated by Cheng to be around 8 jin (about 400 g each) a day and 2 bolts a year, respectively.  Handicraft industry =Steel and iron industries The puddling process of smelting iron ore to make wrought iron from pig iron, with the right illustration displaying men working a blast furnace, from the Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia, 1637. Accompanying the widespread printing of paper money was the beginnings of what one might term an early Chinese industrial revolution. For example, the historian Robert Hartwell has estimated that per capita iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, such that, by 1078 China was producing 127000000 kg (125,000 t) in weight of iron per year.Ebrey et al., 158. However, historian Donald Wagner questions Hartwell's method used to estimate these figures (i.e. by using Song tax and quota receipts).Wagner (2001), 175-197. In the smelting process of using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, massive amounts of charcoal were used in the production process, leading to a wide range of deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 144. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market.Embree, 339. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period. Through many written petitions to the central government by regional administrators of the Song Empire, historical scholars can piece evidence together to appropriate the size and scope of the Chinese iron industry during the Song era. The famed magistrate Bao Qingtian (999-1062) wrote of the iron industry at Hancheng, Tongzhou Prefecture, along the Yellow River in what is today eastern Shaanxi province, with iron smelting households that were overseen by government regulators.Wagner, 181. He wrote that 700 such households were acting as iron smelters, with 200 having the most adequate amount of government support, such as charcoal supplies and skilled craftsmen (the iron households hired local unskilled labor themselves). Bao's complaint to the throne was that government laws against private smelting in Shaanxi hindered profits of the industry, so the government finally heeded his plea and lifted the ban on private smelting for Shaanxi in 1055.Wagner, 182. The result of this was an increase in profit (with lower prices for iron) as well as production; 100,000 jin (60 tonnes) of iron was produced annually in Shaanxi in the 1040s AD, increasing to 600,000 jin (360 tonnes) produced annually by the 1110s, furbished by the revival of the Shaanxi mining industry in 1112.Wagner 182-183. Although the iron smelters of Shaanxi were managed and supplied by the government, there were many independent smelters operated and owned by rich families.Wagner, 178-179. While acting as governor of Xuzhou in 1078, the famous Song poet and statesman Su Shi (1037-1101) wrote that in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture under his administered region, there were 36 iron smelters run by different local families, each employing a work force of several hundred people to mine ore, produce their own charcoal, and smelt iron. Gunpowder production The earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the Wujing Zongyao manuscript compiled in 1044. During the Song period, there was a great deal of organized labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder.Zhang, 487-489. This was done by roasting iron pyrites, converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthenware furnace with a type of still-head to send the sulfur over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated that the major producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub- provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi).Zhang, 489. The bureaucrats appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 126. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their fears of the grave potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans). Since Jin Zhou was in close proximity to the Song capital at Kaifeng, the latter became the largest producer of gunpowder during the Northern Song period. With enhanced sulfur from pyrite instead of natural sulfur (along with enhanced potassium nitrate), the Chinese were able to shift the use of gunpowder from an incendiary use into an explosive one for early artillery.Zhang, 489-490. There were large manufacturing plants in the Song dynasty for the purpose of making 'fire-weapons' employing the use of gunpowder, such as fire lances and fire arrows. While engaged in a war with the Mongols, in 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his Ko Zhai Za Gao, Xu Gao Hou that the city of Qingzhou was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bomb shells a month, dispatching to Xiangyang and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 173-174. One of the main armories and arsenals for the storage of gunpowder and weapons was located at Weiyang, which accidentally caught fire and produced a massive explosion in 1280 AD.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 209-210. Commerce A blast furnace smelting cast iron, with bellows operated by waterwheel and mechanical device, from the Nong Shu by Wang Zhen, 1313 AD This arrangement of allowing competitive industry to flourish in some regions while setting up its opposite of strict government-regulated and monopolized production and trade in others was not exclusive to iron manufacturing.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 23. In the beginning of the Song, the government supported competitive silk mills and brocade workshops in the eastern provinces and in the capital city of Kaifeng. However, at the same time the government established strict legal prohibition on the merchant trade of privately produced silk in Sichuan province. This prohibition dealt an economic blow to Sichuan that caused a small rebellion (which was subdued), yet Song Sichuan was well known for its independent industries producing timber and cultivated oranges. The reforms of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021-1086) sparked heated debate amongst ministers of court when he nationalised the industries manufacturing, processing, and distributing tea, salt, and wine.Ebrey, 164. The state monopoly on Sichuan tea was the prime source of revenue for the state's purchase of horses in Qinghai for the Song army's cavalry forces.Smith, 77. Wang's restrictions on the private manufacture and trade of salt were even criticized in a famous poem by Su Shi, and while the opposing politically charged faction at court gained advantage and lost favor, Wang Anshi's reforms were continually abandoned and reinstated. Despite this political quarrel, the Song Empire's main source of revenue continued to come from state-managed monopolies and indirect taxes.Gernet, 18. As for private entrepreneurship, great profits could still be pursued by the merchants in the luxury item trades and specialized regional production. For example, the silk producers of Raoyang County, Shenzhou Prefecture, southern Hebei province were especially known for producing silken headwear for the Song emperor and high court officials in the capital.Friedman et al., 3. Copper resources and receipts of deposit Jiaozi, the world's first paper-printed currency, an innovation of the Song dynasty. The root of the development of the banknote goes back to the earlier Tang dynasty (618-907), when the government outlawed the use of bolts of silk as currency, which increased the use of copper coinage as money. By the year 1085 the output of copper currency was driven to a rate of 6 billion coins a year up from 5.86 billion in 1080 (compared to just 327 million coins minted annually in the Tang's prosperous Tianbao period of 742-755, and only 220 million coins minted annually from 118 BC to 5 AD during the Han dynasty).Nishijima, 588. The expansion of the economy was unprecedented in China: the output of coinage currency in the earlier year of 997 AD, which was only 800 million coins a year.Bowman, 105. In 1120 alone, the Song government collected of silver in taxes. With many 9th century Tang era merchants avoiding the weight and bulk of so many copper coins in each transaction, this led them to using trading receipts from deposit shops where goods or money were left previously. Merchants would deposit copper currency into the stores of wealthy families and prominent wholesalers, whereupon they would receive receipts that could be cashed in a number of nearby towns by accredited persons.Gernet, 80. Since the 10th century, the early Song government began issuing their own receipts of deposit, yet this was restricted mainly to their monopolized salt industry and trade. China's first official regional paper-printed money can be traced back to the year 1024, in Sichuan province.Morton, 97.Benn, 55. Although the output of copper currency had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085.Ch'en, 615. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China than in the previous Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165.Ch'en, 615-616. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corv√©e labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving up the price of copper money which would become scarce.Ch'en, 619. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins.Ch'en, 621. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance to melt down the currency to make iron weapons.Bol (2001), p. 111. The government attempted to prohibit the use of copper currency in border regions and in seaports, but the Song-issued copper coin became common in the Liao, Western Xia, Japanese, and Southeast Asian economies. The Song government would turn to other types of material for its currency in order to ease the demand on the government mint, including the issuing of iron coinage and paper banknotes.Ch'en, 620. In the year 976, the percentage of issued currency using copper coinage was 65%; after 1135, this had dropped significantly to 54%, a government attempt to debase the copper currency. The world's first paper money Huizi currency currency, issued in 1160. The central government soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right of several of the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit. By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26 million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the central government officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing).Ebrey et al., 156. Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 47. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 48. However, the government still needed masses of paper product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use and enforcement of paper currency was a method undertaken by the government as a response to the counterfeiting of copper coins. The subsequent Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties would issue their own paper money as well. Even the Southern Song's contemporary of the Jin dynasty to the north caught on to this trend and issued their own paper money. At the archeological dig at Jehol there was a printing plate found that dated to the year 1214, which produced notes that measured 10 cm by 19 cm in size and were worth a hundred strings of 80 cash coins. This Jurchen-Jin issued paper money bore a serial number, the number of the series, and a warning label that counterfeiters would be decapitated, and the denouncer rewarded with three hundred strings of cash.Gernet, 80-81. Urban employment and businesses a long handscroll painting by Zhang Zeduan (1085-1145) Within the cities there were a multitude of professions and places of work to choose from, if one were not strictly inheriting a profession of his paternal line. Sinologist historians are fortunate enough to have a wide variety of written sources describing minute details about each location and the businesses within the cities of Song China. For example, in the alleys and avenues around the East Gate of the Xiangguo Temple in Kaifeng, historian Stephen H. West quotes one source: > Along the Temple Eastgate Avenue...are to be found shops specializing in > cloth caps with pointed tails, belts and waiststraps, books, caps and > flowers as well as the vegetarian tea meal of the Ding family...South of the > temple are the brothels of Manager's Alley...The nuns and the brocade > workers live in Embroidery Alley...On the north is Small Sweetwater > Alley...There are a particularly large number of Southern restaurants inside > the alley, as well as a plethora of brothels.West, 71. Similarly, in the \\"Pleasure District\\"West, 72. along the Horse Guild Avenue, near a Zoroastrian temple in Kaifeng, West quotes the same source, Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital): > In addition to the household gates and shops that line the two sides of New > Fengqiu Gate Street...military encampments of the various brigades and > columns [of the Imperial Guard] are situated in facing pairs along > approximately ten li of the approach to the gate. Other wards, alleys, and > confined open spaces crisscross the area, numbering in the tens of > thousands‚Äînone knows their real number. In every single place, the gates are > squeezed up against each other, each with its own tea wards, wineshops, > stages, and food and drink. Normally the small business households of the > marketplace simply purchase [prepared] food and drink at food stores; they > do not cook at home. For northern food there are the Shi Feng style dried > meat cubes...made of various stewed items...for southern food, the House of > Jin at Temple Bridge...and the House of Zhou at Ninebends...are acknowledged > to be the finest. The night markets close after the third watch only to > reopen at the fifth.West, 72-73. A section of the 12th century remake of Gu Hongzhong's 10th century Night Revels of Han Xizai; in this scene there are two musicians and a dancer entertaining the guests of Han Xizai. West points out that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose to go out and eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls.West, 74. Restaurant businesses thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital.Gernet, 133.West, 70. The pleasure district mentioned above‚Äîwhere stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located‚Äîwas teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night.Gernet, 184. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base.West, 76. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.West, 75-76. Foreign trade The Song dynasty actively promoted overseas trade. About fifty countries carried out overseas trade with the Song, among them Ceylon, Langkasuka, Mait, Samboja, Borneo, Kelantan, Champa, Chenla, Bengtrao, Java, India, Calicut, Lambri, Bengal, Kurum, Gujara, Mecca, Egypt, Baghdad, Iraq, Amman, the Almoravid dynasty, Sicily, Morocco, Tanzania, Somalia, Ryukyu, Korea, and Japan.Zhao Rukua (ËµµÊ±ùÈÄÇ Song dynasty), 'Zhufanzhi (ËØ∏Áï™Âøó) Pearls, ivory, rhinoceros horns, frankincense, agalloch eaglewood, coral, agate, hawksbill turtle shell, gardenia, and rose were imported from the Arabs and Samboja, herbal medicine from Java, costusroot from Foloan (Kuala Sungai Berang) cotton cloth, cotton yarn from Mait, and ginseng, silver, copper, and quick silver from Korea.Zhao Yanwei (ËµµÂΩ¶Âç´Song dynasty) Yun Lu Man Chao (‰∫ëÈ∫ìÊº´Èíû) p88 Zhong Hua Book Co To promote overseas trade and maximize government profits in control of imported goods, in 971 the government established a Maritime Trade Supervisorate at Guangzhou, then in 999 established a second one at Hangzhou, a third at Mingzhou (now Ningbo city), followed by Quanzhou (\\"Zaiton\\") in 1079, Huating County (now part of Shanghai) in 1113, and Jiangyin in 1145.Qi Xia, p1175-1178 Initially the Maritime Trade Supervisorate was subordinate under the Department of Transportation or prefecture official, later made into a separate agency with its own supervisor. The roles of the Maritime Trade Supervisorate included: * Taxation of imported goods, tax rate varied over the Song dynasty, from 10% to as high as 40%; however, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong (1048‚Äì1085), the tax rate for imports was lowered to 6.67%. The tax was goods in kind, not money.Guan Luqian, 140-142 * Government purchase and sale of imported goods. In 976, all imported goods from overseas merchants had to be sold only to the government, private sales was prohibited, penalty for violation depended on the quantity of goods involved, and the highest penalty was tattooing of the face and forced labor. Later the 100% rule was relaxed somewhat. The Maritime Trade Superisorate purchased a portion of the finest quality goods, for example 60% for pearls, 40% for rhinocero horn; the low quality leftover goods were allowed to be traded in the market. The purchase rate applied to after tax goods, then paid in money, not according to market price, but according to a government-accessed \\"fare value\\".Guan, p143 In the Southern Song, the Maritime Trade Supervisorates were short of funds and were not paid on time, causing huge losses in profits for overseas merchants; the volume of incoming ships also dropped. *Issue foreign trade permits for local merchants.

The district took its name from a 19th century businessman named Exarchos (Greek: ŒàŒæŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ) who opened a large general store there. Exarcheia is bordered on the east by Kolonaki and is framed by Patission Street, Panepistimiou Street and Alexandras Avenue. Exarcheia is renowned for being Athens' historical core of radical political and intellectual activism. Exarcheia is often considered the anarchist quarter of Athens, known for its radical democracy. Features The National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the National Technical University of Athens and Strefi Hill are all located in Exarcheia. The central square features many caf√©s and bars with numerous retail computer shops located mainly on Stournari street, also called the Greek Silicon Valley. Located on Exarcheia square is one of the oldest summer cinemas of Athens, called \\"Vox\\", as well as the Antonopoulos apartment building, known as the \\"Blue Building\\", because of its original colour, which is a typical example of modern architecture in Athens during the inter-war period. Due to the political and intellectual character of the neighbourhood, many bookstores, fair trade shops and organic food stores are also located in Exarcheia.City of Athens Portal, Retrieved August 23, 2007 Exarcheia is also known for having comic book shops. History View of a street Exarcheia in 1869, surveyed for the building of the National Archaeological Museum, Patission Street. The district of Exarcheia was created between 1870 and 1880 at the confines of the city and has played a significant role in the social and political life of Greece. It is there the Athens Polytechnic uprising of November 1973 took place. In December 2008, the murder of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos by a policeman in Exarcheia caused rioting throughout Greece. Exarcheia is a place where many intellectuals and artists live and an area where many socialist, anarchist, and anti-fascist groups are accommodated. Exarcheia is also an art hub where theatrical shows and concerts are held around the central square. The headquarters of PASOK, a Greek political party that supported austerity measures dictated by the European Union in 2009, are also located in the neighborhood and has been a target of attacks by anarchists. Police stations and other symbols of authority (and capitalism) such as banks are often targets of far-leftist groups.\\"Greek anarchist youths throw petrol bombs at cars outside central Athens police station\\", Pravda, April 26, 2007. Accessed August 23, 2007.\\"Greek police shooting sparks riot\\", BBC, December 7, 2008, Retrieved December 7, 2008. One can find numerous anti-capitalist graffiti in the district. Protests that begin in Exarcheia evidence diverse political formations and coalitions, including dispossessed young people, migrants, anti-authoritarians, anarchists, and Greek citizens from the moderate to extreme on both ends of the political spectrum. The European refugee crisis resulted in an enormous migration to Greece - in 2017, 55,000 people throughout Greece were registered as permanent residents. When borders between Greece and the European Union were closed, many migrants were forced to stay in camps that lacked housing or hygiene infrastructure. As a result, refugees and migrants sought alternative options within Athens, including squats in the Exarcheia neighborhood. Athens Polytechnic uprising On November 17, 1973, the Greek military raided the student occupation of the Athens Polytechnic University, killing 40 civilians. The events resulted in public outrage and the passing of the Academic Asylum Law, which designates university campuses as off-limits to police and military personnel. This law has contributed to the prevalence of protests within Exarcheia, as the Polytechnic functions as a site of insurgent coordination as well as a safe haven from police violence. 2008 Greek riots On December 6, 2008, a Greek police special guard shot and killed 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos within blocks of the Athens Polytechnic University, leading to the largest protests in Greece since the end of the dictatorship in 1974. Protests originated in Exarcheia and the neighborhood continued to be the epicenter of demonstrations as they spread across Athens. In the aftermath of the riots, collectives and movements in Exarcheia expanded initiatives experimenting with new political formations, especially to provide public spaces organized around an anti-hierarchical and anti-commercial ethos. For example, activists turned a parking lot into the guerrilla Park Navarinou, which hosted events such as ticket-free movie screenings and anti-consumerist fairs. The Sporos collective developed solidarity economies through trade and sale of Zapatista-produced goods, and the Skoros collective promoted re-use, recycling, and sharing practices. Other new and renewed political formations in the neighborhood included producer or consumer cooperatives and collective kitchens.  Migrant communities  Exarcheia is the site of a large migrant and refugee community. The overcrowding and abuse within Greek refugee camps has propelled a movement of squatting within Athens and across Greece. There are more than a dozen squats in Athens, primarily centered in Exarcheia, serving as housing, healthcare, and social centers for refugees, migrants, or anarchists. These squats provide space for highly diverse communities and coalitions. For example, the City Plaza squat houses Afghanis, Iraqis, Iranians, Syrians, Kurds, Palestinians, and Pakistanis within a single occupied hotel. Many of these spaces aim to recreate the feeling of home for displaced migrants and refugees. However, far-right, neo-fascist, and nationalistic organizations have been connected to multiple attacks and burnings of refugee squats. In addition, the Syriza government has recently evicted multiple squats in Athens. In addition, Exarcheia and bordering Omonoia have been the focus specialized policing tactics in Greece. These include MAT, (Public Order Restoration Units) an anti-protest police unit implemented after the dictatorship; Operation Virtue, which used blockaded areas and rapid raids of public spaces to capture undocumented migrants in the 1970s and 1980s; and Operation Xenios Zeus, which implemented stop-and-search and document checks for foreigners in 2012.Dalakoglou, Dimitris (2013). \\"The Crisis before 'The Crisis'\\": Violence and Urban Neoliberalization in Athens\\". Social Justice. 39: 24‚Äì42 ‚Äì via ResearchGate. In 2019, a change in political governance affected Exarcheia. The New Democracy party was elected to power nationally in July and the new prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis pledged to impose order and to clean up the district. Subsequently, a new mayor of Athens was elected in August. Immediately, evictions of migrant squats began. The City Plaza squat at 78 Acharnon decided to close itself down on its own terms rather than be evicted. By the end of September 2019, there had been seven evictions, including the 5th School squat.  Ultimatum  The Ministry of Citizen‚Äôs Protection broadened the crackdown on squats in Greece by releasing a statement on 20 November 2019 which demanded all squats were to be evacuated in 15 days' time. Commentators quickly noticed that the end of the deadline was 5 December, the day upon which Alexandros Grigoropoulos had been killed in 2008. More evictions followed and by mid December the state was attempting to evict anarchist social centres as well as migrant squats. The New Democracy party installed a Christmas tree on the central square in December. It was quickly burnt down and when a second tree was put up in its place, it was destroyed several hours later.

It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2014, as the wild population is estimated to have declined by more than 80% in three pangolin generations, equal to 21 years. It is threatened by poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. Characteristics The Chinese pangolin has a prehensile tail Chinese pangolin skeleton on display at the Museum of Osteology The Chinese pangolin has the appearance of a scaly anteater. Its head and body measure about and its tail measures about . A mature Chinese pangolin weighs from . It has 18 rows of overlapping scales accompanied by hair, a rare combination in mammals. It has a small, narrow mouth and a little, pointed head. Also its claws grow in as it grows older. The female gives birth to a single offspring at a time. A newborn pangolin weighs about , its length is about . The Chinese pangolin reproduces in April and May when the weather warms. The young are born with soft scales, which harden after two days. Although the young pangolin can walk on its first day, the mother carries it on her back or tail. If the mother feels threatened, she immediately folds her baby onto her belly with the help of her tail. Male pangolins have been observed allowing the female and baby to share his burrow. Taxonomy Manis pentadactyla was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the Chinese pangolin. In the 19th century and 20th centuries, several Chinese pangolin specimens were collected and described: * Manis pentadactyla auritus by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1836 * Manis pentadactyla pusilla by Joel Asaph Allen in 1906  Distribution and habitat  The Chinese pangolin is native to southern Nepal, northern India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, northern Indochina, southern China including the island of Hainan, and most of Taiwan. It has been recorded up to an elevation of . Habitats include: *Primary and secondary tropical forests *Bamboo forests *Limestone forests *Broadleaf forests *Coniferous forests *Agricultural fields *Grasslands Behaviour and ecology The Chinese pangolin is a rather secretive, nocturnal animal. It moves slowly. Its hard scales work as a protective cover from predators, and when it feels threatened, it curls into a ball (\\"volvation\\").  Diet  Chinese pangolin in Leipzig Zoo The Chinese pangolin feeds mainly on insects, particularly termites and ants. It digs into ant nests and termite mounds with its large fore claws and extracts insects with its long, sticky tongue. The Chinese pangolin digs long burrows in the ground, which they use to sleep and hunt termites. Due to its specific diet, it can become arduous to provide the appropriate food for captive animals. Since the 1970s \\"pangolins are now almost unknown to visitors and are exhibited infrequently in zoos\\", and have \\"historically been difficult to maintain, with most captive animals dying within a short period after capture\\". When in their natural habitat, this species lives \\"on a diet of ants, termites, and various other invertebrates including bee larvae, flies, worms, earthworms, and crickets\\". After carefully creating new, more sustainable recipes in zoos, some of the ingredients used have included \\"egg, meat (ground beef, horse, canned feline diet), evaporated milk products, milk powder, fish protein, orchid leaves, commercial chows, psyllium seed, carrots, yeast, multivitamins, and insects (mixtures of silkworm larvae, earth, ants, termites, meal worms, or crickets)\\". A number of zoos that have kept pangolins under observation have found that the animals died most commonly after a few years, without breeding successfully. Researchers claim this outcome is correlated to the \\"poor acceptance of captive diets and digestive problems.\\" The Chinese Pangolin is considered to be high risk in terms of extinction. Threats The Chinese pangolin is threatened foremost by poaching. Chinese people eat its meat, and its scales are used as an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. In the 1960s, about 170,000 to 180,000 Chinese pangolins were seized annually across the Chinese provinces Fujian, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunan and Guangdong. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in 2002 prohibited selling pangolins across national borders. Although China has already passed laws to protect the pangolin, it might not be enough to save the species. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora reports that pangolins are the most trafficked and poached mammal.Foley, James A. \\"Plight of the Pangolin: The Most Trafficked Animal on Earth Needs More Protection.\\" Nature World News RSS. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. The Chinese pangolin is hunted for its meat, claws, and scales. Pangolin meat, which is considered a delicacy in parts of China and Vietnam, has been reported to sell for as high as US$200/kg. Pangolin scales and blood are in demand in Asia for their supposed medicinal qualities.\\"PROJECT PANGOLIN.\\" PROJECT PANGOLIN RSS. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Oct. 2014. Chinese pangolin scales are sold to treat a wide variety of ailments, from cancer to upset stomach to asthma. Other pangolin body parts are also used in traditional Chinese medicine. Local people in eastern Nepal consider pangolin scales as good-luck charms. Though pangolins have been protected by legislation since the 1970s and 1980s, people still choose to hunt these endangered animals. After random inspections on 28 May 2014, at the Kwai Chung cargo port in Hong Kong, officials detained scales from nearly 8,000 pangolins. Just two weeks later, Hong Kong officials seized a second shipment that contained scales from about 5,000 pangolins. The Indonesian Forestry Ministry director of investigations and forest observation, Raffles Panjaitan, told the Jakarta Post that in October 2011, his agency had 587 cases of pangolin trafficking since 2006. The estimated value is US$4.3 million worth of pangolins on the illegal market.Clifton, Merritt. \\"Armor Is Not Enough to Protect Pangolins.\\" Animals 247. N.p., 8 Aug. 2014. Web. 20 Oct. 2014. The journal Frontiers in Ecology & the Environment estimated that the remains of about 10,000 pangolins are intercepted each year.\\"12 Chinese Men Whose Boat Had Frozen Pangolin Meat Convicted Of Poaching In Philippine Park.\\" Canadian Press, The (n.d.): Points of View Reference Center. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. Zhao-Min Zhou and Macdonald from Frontiers in Ecology & the Environment claim from their records that 220 living pangolins and the remains of 4,909 dead pangolins were seized in 43 law enforcement actions since 2010. In April 2013, the Philippine coast guard seized a boat containing of pangolin meat and 400 boxes containing thousands of frozen skinned pangolins and scaly anteaters from Indonesia. The Regional Trial Court in Puerto Princesa city in Palawan province sentenced the boat captain to 12 years in prison and each crew member received from six to 10 years. Each member of the crew was also fined $100,000. Conservation In 2016, CITES moved the Chinese pangolin from its Appendix II, designating species not directly threatened with extinction but in need of protection to prevent exploitation, to Appendix I, reserved for species most directly threatened with extinction. The Appendix I listing prohibits commercial trade in wild-caught specimens. Many range countries have already passed legislation to protect it: *1972 ‚Äì India fully protected the Chinese pangolin by classifying it as a Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act. *1973 ‚Äì Nepal made it a Schedule I protected animal under the National Parks and Wildlife Protection Act. *1976 ‚Äì Hong Kong implemented the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance to protect this species and others that are endangered. *1989 ‚Äì China classified the species as a State Category II protected animal with the Protection of Wildlife Act. *1990 ‚Äì Taiwan added the entire Manis genus to be protected under the Wildlife Conservation Law, first passed in 1989. *1992 ‚Äì China increased protection of the species using the Regulations on the Implementation of Protection of Terrestrial Wild Animals legislation. In the same year, Thailand classified the genus Manis as protected under the Wild Animals Reservation and Protection Act B.E. 2535. *1994 ‚Äì Myanmar enacted the Protection of Wildlife and Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas law, which fully protected the species. *2000 ‚Äì China established more defined terms for the punishment of crimes specifically involving pangolins. *2006 ‚Äì China enacted the Regulations on Management of Import and Export of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to meet CITES guidelines. Additionally, Hong Kong increased its protection of the Chinese pangolin with the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants law. In 2006, Vietnam classified it as a fully protected species in group IIB of Decree 32 in the Management of Endangered, Precious, and Rare Species of Wild Plants and Animals. *2007 ‚Äì China intensified its regulations for the use of pangolins in traditional medicines by terminating pangolin hunting licenses, and requiring current stockpiles of pangolin scales to be registered and subject to trade only through designated buyers, like hospitals. Meanwhile, Laos declared the species as near extinction, but of high importance in the prohibition category of the Wildlife and Aquatic Law. *2012 ‚Äì Bangladesh granted protection of the Chinese pangolin through the Wildlife Conservation and Security Act. *2020 ‚Äì China raised the protection status of all pangolin species, including the Chinese pangolin, to the highest level. China has passed much more legislation for pangolin protection than other countries, because the species' population has drastically declined in China over the last few decades. This is the direct result of extreme poaching for pangolin scales and meat. Conservation efforts In May 2016, a poll representing 1,892 Chinese adults revealed that more than 80% of the Chinese public want pangolins to be protected. The survey was led by Aita Foundation and Humane Society International. The IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group made a proposal in July 2014 to increase awareness, funding, and research for pangolin conservation. Some of the plan's highlights include making protocols to monitor pangolin populations, establishing a consumption index of pangolin products, using DNA analysis to determine variation between and within species, and identifying species strongholds to determine best allocation of resources.Challender, DWS, Waterman, C, and Baillie, JEM. 2014. Scaling up pangolin conservation. IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group Conservation Action Plan. Zoological Society of London. Furthermore, the conservation plan aims to increase patrol-based monitoring around stronghold populations, increase awareness and education about the severity of the problem, and, most importantly, implement a demand reduction strategy for pangolin meat and scales. Another alternative to legislation, proposed by IUCN, includes offering positive incentives, like monetary payments or control over land's resources, to local communities for their involvement in conservation efforts.Challender, Dan. \\"Positive Incentives for Conserving Pangolins in Asia and the Challenges to Be Overcome.\\" SULiNews 7 (Dec. 2013): n. pag. IUCN. Web. Other researchers have proposed the importance of finding biological substitutes for endangered species used in traditional medicines.Luo, Jiao- yang et al. \\"A Strategy for Trade Monitoring and Substitution of the Organs of Threatened Animals.\\" Scientific Reports. Nature Publishing Group, 31 Oct. 2013. Web. 22 Oct. 2014. DNA barcoding and analysis could be used to determine what common species are genetically similar enough and produce similar effects as the Chinese pangolin scales. To crack down on poaching, the barcoding technique could also be used for accurate detection of species products being imported and exported. The China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), a non-profit and non-governmental organization is particularly proactive in doing research and collecting field data for the conservation of Chinese pangolins. Since July 2017, the Beijing- based NGO has established three Chinese pangolin Community Conservation Areas in Hunan, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces. Community Conservation Area in Jiangxi province In late August 2017, CBCGDF confiscated 33 Chinese pangolins from Chinese poachers and released them to the Guangxi Wildlife Rescue Centre. Suggestions from the foundation such as the improvement of their rescue regulations and procedures; their immediate release to the wild after full recovery; keeping information open to the public; revising the endangered species conservation laws and regulations in Guangxi, followed the release. However, only 14 Chinese pangolins survived. At the World Pangolin Day 2017, CBCGDF called for deletion of pangolin scales from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Book. CBCGDF also called for the burning of confiscated pangolin scales illegally trafficked to China. Moreover, in July 2018, a conference organised by CBCGDF hosted the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). During that conference, CBCGDF openly shared recent and precious data on Chinese pangolins with GBIF.

The Song dynasty (; 960‚Äì1279 CE) invented some technological advances in Chinese history, many of which came from talented statesmen drafted by the government through imperial examinations. The ingenuity of advanced mechanical engineering had a long tradition in China. The Song engineer Su Song admitted that he and his contemporaries were building upon the achievements of the ancients such as Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139), an astronomer, inventor, and early master of mechanical gears.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 466. The application of movable type printing advanced the already widespread use of woodblock printing to educate and amuse Confucian students and the masses. The application of new weapons employing the use of gunpowder enabled the Song to ward off its militant enemies‚Äîthe Liao, Western Xia, and Jin with weapons such as cannons‚Äîuntil its collapse to the Mongol forces of Kublai Khan in the late 13th century. Notable advances in civil engineering, nautics, and metallurgy were made in Song China, as well as the introduction of the windmill to China during the thirteenth century. These advances, along with the introduction of paper-printed money, helped revolutionize and sustain the economy of the Song dynasty. Polymaths and mechanical engineering The original diagram of the book by Su Song in 1092, showing the inner workings of his clock tower, with the clepsydra tank, a waterwheel with scoops and the escapement, a chain drive, the armillary sphere crowning the top, and the rotating wheel with clock jacks that sounded the hours with bells, gongs, and drums.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 165 & 455. Polymaths Polymath geniuses‚Äîthat is, people knowledgeable across an encyclopaedic range of topics‚Äîsuch as Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095) and Su Song (1020‚Äì1101) embodied the spirit of early empirical science and technology in the Song era. Shen is famous for discovering the concept of true north and magnetic declination towards the North Pole by calculating a more accurate measurement of the astronomical meridian, and fixing the calculated position of the pole star that had shifted over the centuries.Sivin, III, 22. This allowed sailors to navigate the seas more accurately with the magnetic needle compass, also first described by Shen. Shen was made famous for his written description of Bi Sheng, the inventor of movable type printing. Shen was also interested in geology, as he formulated a theory of geomorphology and climate change over time after making observations of strange natural phenomena.Sivin, III, 23.Needham, Volume 3, 618. Using contemporary knowledge of solar eclipses and lunar eclipses, he theorized that the sun and moon were spherical in shape, not flat, while expanding upon the reasoning of earlier Chinese astronomical theorists.Needham, Volume 3, 415‚Äì416. Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen used cosmological hypotheses when describing the variations of planetary motion, including retrogradation.Sivin, III, 16.Sivin, III, 19. One of Shen's greatest achievements, aided by Wei Pu, was correcting the lunar error by diligently recording and plotting the moon's orbital path three times a night over a period of five years.Sivin, III, 18‚Äì19. Unfortunately Shen had many political rivals at court who were determined to sabotage his work. The court fully accepted their corrections to lunar and solar error, but only partially adopted Shen and Wei's corrected plotting of the planetary orbital paths and various speeds. Su Song, one of Shen Kuo's political rivals at court, wrote a famous pharmaceutical treatise in 1070 known as the Bencao Tujing, which included related subjects on botany, zoology, metallurgy, and mineralogy.Unschuld, 60.Wu, 5. This treatise included many medicinal applications, including the use of ephedrin as a pharmaceutical drug.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 446. He also was the author of a large celestial atlas of five different star maps,Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 569. and his extensive written and illustrative work in cartography helped solve a heated border dispute between the Song dynasty and its Khitan neighbor of the Liao dynasty.Wright, 213. However, Su was most famous for his hydraulic-powered astronomical clock tower, crowned with a mechanically driven armillary sphere, which was erected in the capital city of Kaifeng in the year 1088.Sivin, III, 31‚Äì32. Su's clock tower employed the escapement mechanism two centuries before it was applied in clocks of Europe.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 445.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 448. Su's clock tower also featured the earliest known endless power-transmitting chain drive in the world, as outlined in his horological treatise of 1092.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 111. The cases of these two men display the eagerness of the Song in drafting highly skilled officials who were knowledgeable in the various sciences which could ultimately benefit the administration, the military, the economy, and the people. One of five star maps published in Su Song's horological and astronomical book of 1092 CE, featuring Shen Kuo's corrected position of the pole star as well as a cylindrical projection similar to Mercator projection Intellectual men of letters like the versatile Shen Kuo dabbled in subjects as diverse as mathematics, geography, geology, economics, engineering, medicine, art criticism, archaeology, military strategy, and diplomacy, among others.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 148. On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a raised-relief map of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed the total number of possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers.Ebrey, 162. Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow clepsydra clock for a more efficient higher-order interpolation, the armillary sphere, the gnomon, and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the pole star and other celestial bodies.Sivin, III, 17. Shen Kuo also experimented with camera obscura, only a few decades after the first to do so, Ibn al-Haytham (965‚Äì1039).Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 98. Odometer and south-pointing chariot There were many other important figures in the Song era besides Shen Kuo and Su Song, many of whom contributed greatly to the technological innovations of the time period. Although the mechanically driven mile-marking device of the carriage- drawn odometer had been known in China since the ancient Han dynasty, the Song Shi (compiled in 1345) provides a much greater description and more in-depth view of the device than earlier Chinese sources. The Song Shi states: > The odometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of > flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, > handsomely adorned with carvings. At the completion of every li, the wooden > figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum; at the completion of > every ten li, the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell. The > carriage-pole ends in a phoenix-head, and the carriage is drawn by four > horses. The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yongxi > reign period (987) the emperor Taizong increased it to 30. In the 5th year > of the Tian-Sheng reign-period (1027) the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong > presented specifications for the construction of odometers as follows: > [...]Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 283. What follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears. However, the concluding paragraph provides description at the end of how the device ultimately functions: > When the middle horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will > have gone 1 li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the > drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage > will have gone 10 li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the > bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is in all, with a total of > 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the > \\"dog-teeth\\" mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution > everything comes back to its original starting point.Needham, Volume 4, Part > 2, 284. In the Song period (and once during the earlier Tang period), the odometer device was combined with the south-pointing chariot device, which was probably first invented by the ancient Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (200‚Äì265). The south-pointing chariot was a wheeled vehicle that may, in some cases, have incorporated complex differential gears. (These are used now in nearly all modern automobiles to apply equal amounts of torque to wheels rotating at different speeds while turning.) The differential gears could have been used to keep a mechanically operated pointer aiming in a fixed direction, to the south, compensating for whatever turns the chariot made. Other arrangements of gears could also have been used for the same purpose. The device used mechanical dead reckoning, rather than the magnetism of a compass, in order to navigate and find one's directional bearings. Yan Su (; c. 961‚Äì1040), the Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, recreated a south-pointing chariot device in 1027, and his specifications for creating the device were provided in the Song Shi.Sivin, III, 31. This is of little surprise, as Yan was somewhat of a polymath like Shen Kuo and Su Song, improving the design of the clepsydra clock, writing on mathematical harmonics, theory about tides, etc. The Song Shi text records that it was the engineer Wu Deren who combined the south-pointing chariot and odometer in the year 1107: > In the first year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107), the Chamberlain Wu > Deren presented specifications of the south-pointing carriage and the > carriage with the li-recording drum (odometer). The two vehicles were made, > and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral > sacrifice.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 292. The text then went on to describe in full detail the intricate mechanical design for the two devices combined into one. (See the article on the south- pointing chariot). Revolving repositories The Longxing Monastery, home to the oldest extant Chinese mechanical revolving-repository book case. Revolving book case in Yingzao Fashi Besides clockwork, hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and mechanical compass vehicles, there were other impressive devices of mechanical engineering found during the Song dynasty. Although literary references for mechanical revolving repositories and book cases of Buddhist temples trace back to at least 823 during the Tang dynasty,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 549. they came to prominence during the Song dynasty. The invention of the revolving book case is considered to have happened earlier, and is credited to the layman Fu Xi in 544. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripi·π≠aka scriptures. Furthermore, the oldest surviving rotating book case dates to the Song period (12th century), found at the Longxing Monastery of Zhengding, Hebei province.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, Plate CCLXIX, Fig. 683. However, there were nine prominently known revolving repositories during the Song period, and one of them was even featured in an illustration of Li Jie's book Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') of 1103.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 551. The rotating repository of 1119 in Kaifu Temple near Changsha had five wheels which all turned together, and the revolving repository at Nanchan Temple of Suzhou featured a brake system of some sort (sinologists are still uncertain how this operated, since the earliest known curve brake bands appear in the time of Leonardo da Vinci in Europe).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 552. A later Muslim traveler Shah Rukh (son of the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur) came to Ming dynasty China in 1420 during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, and described a revolving repository in Ganzhou of Gansu province that he called a 'kiosque': > In another temple there is an octagonal kiosque, having from the top to the > bottom fifteen stories. Each story contains apartments decorated with > lacquer in the Cathayan manner, with ante-rooms and verandahs...It is > entirely made of polished wood, and this again gilded so admirably that it > seems to be of solid gold. There is a vault below it. An iron shaft fixed in > the center of the kiosque traverses it from bottom to top, and the lower end > of this works in an iron plate, whilst the upper end bears on strong > supports in the roof of the edifice which contains this pavilion. Thus a > person in the vault can with a trifling exertion cause this great kiosque to > revolve. All the carpenters, smiths, and painters in the world would learn > something in their trades by coming here!Needham Volume 4, Part 2, 554. Textile machinery Detail of The Spinning Wheel, by Wang Juzheng, Northern Song era (960‚Äì1127). In the field of manufacturing textiles, Joseph Needham (1900‚Äì1995) wrote that the Chinese invented the quilling-wheel by the 12th century,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 107. and wrote the mechanical belt drive was known since the 11th century.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 108. Qin Guan's book Can Shu (Book of Sericulture) of 1090 described a silk-reeling machine with an oscillating 'proto-flyer', as the apparatus of the main reel of which the silk is bound is wound and powered by treadle motion. In this device the ramping arm of the flyer was activated simultaneously by a subsidiary belt drive. This machine was portrayed in an illustration of the Geng Zhi Tu book of 1237,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 107-108. and again a more elaborate illustration was provided in a 17th-century book. Qin Guan's 1090 book stated that: > The pulley (bearing the eccentric lug) is provided with a groove for the > reception of the driving belt, an endless band which responds to the > movement of the machine by continuously rotating the pulley. An endless rope or cord may have been used in Du Shi's device of waterwheels that powered bellows of the blast furnace in the 1st century (see Wind Power below). Movable type printing Printing technology in the form of movable type was invented by Bi Sheng (; 990‚Äì1051) in the 11th century. The work of Bi Sheng was written of by Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays (Mengxi Bitan).Bowman, 105. Movable type, alongside woodblock printing, increased literacy with the mass production of printed materials. This meant that parents could encourage sons to learn to read and write and therefore be able to take the imperial examination and become part of the growing learned bureaucracy. Movable type printing was further advanced in Joseon era Korea, where Bi Sheng's baked clay characters were scrapped for metal type characters in 1234.Ebrey, 238. The movable type of Bi Sheng was later improved upon by Wang Zhen (1290‚Äì1333), who invented wooden movable type c. 1298, and Hua Sui (1439‚Äì1513), who invented bronze movable type in China in 1490; yet the Koreans had metal movable type before Hua Sui, and even Wang Zhen had experimented with tin-metal movable type.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 217. Although movable type and woodblock printing would remain the dominant types of printing methods for centuries, the European printing press (employing the Hellenistic screw-press) was eventually adopted by East Asian countries. The Bencao on traditional Chinese medicine; printed with woodblock in 1249, Song dynasty For printing, the mass production of paper for writing was already well established in China. The papermaking process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50‚Äì121) in 105, and was in widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century.Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 1. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money‚Äîthe banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi).Ebrey, 156. Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, paper bags for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had done a great service were rewarded by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper envelopes.Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 122. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed to meet the needs of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 48. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. Gunpowder warfare Earliest known representation of a gun (a fire lance) and a grenade (upper right), from the cave murals at Dunhuang, c. 950 CE Flamethrower Advances in military technology aided the Song dynasty in its defense against hostile neighbors to the north. The flamethrower found its origins in Byzantine-era Greece, employing Greek fire (a chemically complex, highly flammable petrol fluid) in a device with a siphon hose by the 7th century.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 77. The earliest reference to Greek Fire in China was made in 917, written by Wu Renchen in his Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 80. In 919, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the 'fierce fire oil' that could not be doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu in his Wuyue Beishi, hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire (see also Pen Huo Qi).Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 81. Lin Yu mentioned also that the 'fierce fire oil' derived ultimately from one of China's maritime contacts in the 'southern seas', Arabia (Dashiguo).Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 82. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King from Wuyue defeated a Huainan army from the Wu state; Wenmu's success was facilitated by the use of 'fire oil' ('huo you') to burn their fleet, signifying the first Chinese use of gunpowder in a battle.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 81‚Äì83 The Chinese applied the use of double- piston bellows to pump petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and downstroke), lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame. This device was featured in description and illustration of the Wujing Zongyao military manuscript of 1044. In the suppression of the Southern Tang state by 976, early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 89. A Chinese flamethrower from the Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 CE, Song dynasty Fire lance Although the destructive effects of gunpowder were described in the earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest-known existent written formulas for gunpowder come from the Wujing Zongyao text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 138. The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 224‚Äì225. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 220‚Äì221. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong').Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 221. This ancestor to the gun was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 263‚Äì364. In 1132, at the Siege of De'an, Song Chinese forces used fire lances against the rival Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.Needham, Volume V, Part 7, 222. Gun An early known depiction of a gun is a sculpture from a cave in Sichuan, dating to 1128, that portrays a figure carrying a vase-shaped bombard, firing flames and a cannonball. However, the oldest existent archaeological discovery of a metal barrel handgun is the Heilongjiang hand cannon from the Chinese Heilongjiang excavation, dated to 1288.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 293. The Chinese also discovered the explosive potential of packing hollowed cannonball shells with gunpowder. Written later by Jiao Yu in his Huolongjing (mid 14th century), this manuscript recorded an earlier Song-era cast iron cannon known as the 'flying-cloud thunderclap eruptor' (fei yun pi- li pao). The manuscript stated that: > The shells are made of cast iron, as large as a bowl and shaped like a ball. > Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying > towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; and when they get there a sound like > a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells > are fired successfully into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set > ablaze...Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 264. An illustration of a trebuchet catapult, as described in the Wujing Zongyao of 1044. As noted before, the change in terminology for these new weapons during the Song period were gradual. The early Song cannons were at first termed the same way as the Chinese trebuchet catapult. A later Ming dynasty scholar known as Mao Yuanyi would explain this use of terminology and true origins of the cannon in his text of the Wubei Zhi, written in 1628: > The Song people used the turntable trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and > the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They were all called 'fire trebuchets' > because they were used to project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, > (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance. They were the ancestors of the > cannon.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 22. Land mine The 14th century Huolongjing was also one of the first Chinese texts to carefully describe to the use of explosive land mines, which had been used by the late Song Chinese against the Mongols in 1277, and employed by the Yuan dynasty afterwards. The innovation of the detonated land mine was accredited to one Luo Qianxia in the campaign of defense against the Mongol invasion by Kublai Khan,Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 192. Later Chinese texts revealed that the Chinese land mine employed either a rip cord or a motion booby trap of a pin releasing falling weights that rotated a steel flint wheel, which in turn created sparks that ignited the train of fuses for the land mines.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199. Rocket Furthermore, the Song employed the earliest known gunpowder-propelled rockets in warfare during the late 13th century,Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 477. its earliest form being the archaic fire arrow. When the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng fell to the Jurchens in 1126, it was written by Xia Shaozeng that 20,000 fire arrows were handed over to the Jurchens in their conquest.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 154. An even earlier Chinese text of the Wujing Zongyao (\\"Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques\\"), written in 1044 by the Song scholars Zeng Kongliang and Yang Weide, described the use of three spring or triple bow arcuballista that fired arrow bolts holding gunpowder packets near the head of the arrow. Going back yet even farther, the Wu Li Xiao Shi (1630, second edition 1664) of Fang Yizhi stated that fire arrows were presented to Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960‚Äì976) in 960.Partington, 240. Civil engineering A canal lock system in modern-day France which uses the pound lock system developed during the Song dynasty. In ancient China, the sluice gate, the canal lock, and flash lock had been known since at least the 1st century BCE (as sources then alluded that they were not new innovations), during the ancient Han dynasty (202 BCE‚Äì220 CE).Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 344‚Äì350. During the Song dynasty that the pound lock was first invented in 984 by the Assistant Commissioner of Transport for Huainan, the engineer Qiao Weiyue.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 350. During his day, the Chinese became concerned with a barge traffic problem at the Shanyang Yundao section of the Grand Canal, as ships often became wrecked while passing the double slipways and were robbed of the tax grain by local bandits. The historical text of the Song Shi (compiled in 1345) stated that in 984: > Qiao Weiyue also built five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and > Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes > for the barges to go up and down. Their cargoes of imperial tax-grain were > heavy, and as they were passing over they often came to grief and were > damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the > workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore > first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West > River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more > than 50 paces (250 ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great > roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) > the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and > then when the time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a > horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all > the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and > the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.Needham, > Volume 4, Part 3, 351. Diagram of a canal pound lock, invented in the 10th century and written of by Shen Kuo. This practice became widespread, and was even written of by the Chinese polymath scientist Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays (1088).Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 351‚Äì352. Shen Kuo wrote that the establishment of pound lock gates at Zhenzhou (presumably Kuozhou along the Yangtze) during the Tian Sheng reign period (1023‚Äì1031) freed up the use of five hundred working laborers at the canal each year, amounting to the saving of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash annually.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 352. He wrote that the old method of hauling boats over limited the size of the cargo to 300 tan of rice per vessel (roughly ), but after the pound locks were introduced, boats carrying 400 tan (roughly ) could then be used. Shen wrote that by his time (c. 1080) government boats could carry cargo weights of up to 700 tan (), while private boats could hold as much as 800 bags, each weighing 2 tan (i.e. ). Shen Kuo also noted that proper use of sluice gates at irrigation canals was the best means of achieving success in the silt fertilization method.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 230‚Äì231. However, agricultural and transportation needs had the potential to conflict with one another. This is best represented in the Dongpo Zhilin of the governmental official and famous poet Su Shi (1037‚Äì1101), who wrote about two decades before Shen Kuo in 1060: > Several years ago the government built sluice gates for the silt > fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite > of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When > the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this > caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents > subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields > were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as > what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). > Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I > remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which he says that > he once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was > getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that > the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the > Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by > fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water > and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to > shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period > there were government fields and sluice gates on both sides of the river, > and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was > high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be > done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from > experts.Needham Volume 4, Part 3, 230. Although the drydock had been known in Ptolemaic Egypt since the late 3rd century BCE (by a Phoenician; not used again until Henry VII of England in 1495), the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of its use in China to repair boats during the 11th century. In his Dream Pool Essays (1088), Shen Kuo wrote: > At the beginning of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang > and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more > than (60.00 m/200 ft) in length.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 660, 200 feet. > The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, > containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. > After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was > impossible as long as they were afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 > to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan.

Nautics=Background Ma Yuan, featuring the oldest known depiction of a fishing reelNeedham, Volume 4, Part 2, 100. The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who traveled to ports of call as far away as Fatimid Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post rudders and guided by the directional compass. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass. This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.Sivin, III, 21. Literature Detail of river vessels docking at Kaifeng, from Along the River During Qingming Festival, by Zhang Zeduan (1085‚Äì1145). Along the River. There were plenty of descriptions in Chinese literature of the time on the operations and aspects of seaports, maritime merchant shipping, overseas trade, and the sailing ships themselves. In 1117, the author Zhu Yu wrote not only of the magnetic compass for navigation, but also a hundred-foot line with a hook that was cast over the deck of the ship, used to collect mud samples at the bottom of the sea in order for the crew to determine their whereabouts by the smell and appearance of the mud.Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 279. In addition, Zhu Yu wrote of watertight bulkhead compartments in the hulls of ships to prevent sinking if damaged, the for-and-aft lug, taut mat sails, and the practice of beating-to- windward.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 463. Confirming Zhu Yu's writing on Song dynasty ships with bulkhead hull compartments, in 1973 a long, wide Song trade ship from c. 1277 was dredged from the water near the southern coast of China that contained 12 bulkhead compartment rooms in its hull.Ebrey, 159. Maritime culture during the Song period was enhanced by these new technologies, along with the allowance of greater river and canal traffic. All around there was a bustling display of government run grain-tax transport ships, tribute vessels and barges, private shipping vessels, a multitude of busy fishers in small fishing boats, along with the rich enjoying the comforts of their luxurious private yachts. Besides Zhu Yu there were other prominent Chinese authors of maritime interests as well. In 1178, the Guangzhou customs officer Zhou Qufei, who wrote in Lingwai Daida about the Arab slave trade of Africans as far as Madagascar,Levathes, 37. stated this about Chinese seagoing ships, their sizes, durability at sea, and the lives of those on board: Chinese cargo ships accompanied by a smaller boat; notice the large stern-mounted rudder on the ship shown in the foreground junk ship, 13th century; Chinese ships of the Song period featured hulls with watertight compartments. > The ships which sail the southern sea and south of it are like houses. When > their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders > are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, > and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine > fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no going back to > the mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At > daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their > fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board > everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the > countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a > country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and > such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. > But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the > sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have > to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond > (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may > be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon > hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A > great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but > rather in shallow water it will come to grief.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, > 464. The later Muslim Moroccan Berber traveler Ibn Battuta (1304‚Äì1377) wrote in greater detail about Chinese sailing vessels than Zhou Qufei. He noted that in and around the seas of China, only the distinct Chinese junks were used to sail the waters.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 469 He noted that the largest type of Chinese ships boasted a total of twelve sailing masts, while the smaller ones had three. On Chinese ships and their crews, Ibn Battuta stated: > The sails of these vessels are made of strips of bamboo, woven into the form > of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change > the direction of them according to whether the wind is blowing from one side > or the other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the > wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 > marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with > shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed > by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a > pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These > vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, > or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou). Ibn Battuta then went on describing the means of their construction, and accurate depictions of separate bulkhead compartments in the hulls of the ships: > This is the manner in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very > thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are > placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured longitudinally and > transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length.

On the sides of these pieces of wood > also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or > 15 men (each), who row standing up. Although Ibn Battuta had mentioned the size of the sailing crew, he described the sizes of the vessels further, as well as the lavish merchant cabins on board: > The vessels have four decks, upon which there are cabins and saloons for > merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain cupboards and other > conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their > occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines.

When he arrives at the > guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances on each side of the > gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 470. Paddle-wheel ships Paddle-wheel ship, 1726 During the Song dynasty there was also great amount of attention given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as paddle wheel craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century,Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 31. and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful paddle wheel warship design of Li Gao. In 1134, the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had paddle wheel warships constructed with a total of nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 421. However, there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured on each side of the vessel.Morton, 104. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103‚Äì1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and paddle wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183, the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle wheel craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162‚Äì1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle wheel craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of paddle wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 422. However, paddle wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that paddle wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 423. Metallurgy An illustration of blast furnace bellows operated by waterwheels, from the Nong Shu, by Wang Zhen, 1313, during the Yuan dynasty. The art of metallurgy during the Song dynasty built upon the efforts of earlier Chinese dynasties, while new methods were incorporated. The Chinese of the ancient Han dynasty (202 BCE‚Äì220 CE) figured out how to create steel by smelting together the carbon intermediary of wrought iron and cast iron by the 1st century BCE.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 563 gGernet, 69.Morton, 287. However, there were two new Chinese innovations of the Song dynasty to create steel during the 11th century. This was the \\"berganesque\\" method that produced inferior, inhomogeneous steel, while the other was a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that utilized partial decarbonization via repeated forging under a cold blast.Hartwell, 53‚Äì54. The per capita iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, and by 1078 Song China was producing in weight of iron per year.Ebrey et al., 158. The historian Donald B. Wagner points out that this estimate was based upon the total number of government tax receipts on iron from the various iron-producing prefectures in the empire.Wagner, 177. In the smelting process of using huge bellows driven by hydraulics (i.e. large waterwheels), massive amounts of charcoal were used in the production process, leading to a wide range of deforestation in northern China.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 144. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land and prime timber in northern China were spared by the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources to coal. This massive increase in output of the iron and steel industry in China was the result of the Song dynasty's needs for military expansion, private commercial demands for metal products such as cooking utensils found in the market and a wide variety of agricultural tools, and by new canals linking major centers of iron and steel production to the capital city's bustling market.Embree, 339. The many uses for manufactured iron products in the Song period included iron for weapons,Wagner, 175. implements, coins, architectural elements, musical bells, artistic statues, and components for machinery such as the hydraulic-powered trip hammer, which had been known since the 1st century BCE during the ancient Han dynasty,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 390‚Äì392. and used extensively during the Song.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 393. Due to the enormous amount of production, the economic historian Robert Hartwell noted that Chinese iron and coal production in the following 12th century was equal to if not greater than England's iron and coal production in the early phase of the Industrial Revolution during the late 18th century.Embree, 712. However, the Chinese of the Song period did not harness the energy potential of coal in ways that would generate power mechanically, as in the later Industrial Revolution that would originate in the West.China. (2007). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. From Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved on 2007-06-28 There were certain administrative prefectures during the Song era where the Chinese iron industry was mostly concentrated. For example, the poet and statesman Su Shi wrote a memorial to the throne in 1078 that specified 36 ironwork smelters, each employing a work force of several hundred people, in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture (under his governance while he administered Xuzhou).Wagner, 178‚Äì179. Wind power The effect of wind power was appreciated in China long before the introduction of the windmill during the Song period. It is uncertain when the ancient Chinese used their very first inflatable bellows as wind-blowing machines for kilns and furnaces. They existed perhaps as far back as the Shang dynasty (1600‚Äì1050 BCE), due to the intricate bronze casting technology of the period. They were certainly used since the advent of the blast furnace in China from the 6th century BCE onwards, since cast iron farm tools and weapons were widespread by the 5th century BCE.Ebrey, 30. In 31, the Han dynasty governmental prefect and engineer Du Shi (d. 38) employed the use of horizontal waterwheels and a complex mechanical gear system to operate the large bellows that heated the blast furnace in smelting cast iron.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 370. Bellows continued in use for purposes of metallurgy, but other sources of wind power were discovered and harnessed. The Han dynasty artisan Ding Huan (fl. 180) not only pioneered the invention of the cardan suspension, but also the rotary fan,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 33. which could be used as a simple air conditioner.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 233. This employed seven wheels, each about 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and manually powered, but by the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) palaces featured water-powered rotary fans for air conditioning, and in the Song dynasty, states Needham, \\"the refrigerant effects of artificial draught seem to have been appreciated ever more widely.\\"Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 151. There was also an intricate Chinese rotary fan winnowing machine depicted in Wang Zhen's agricultural treatise of the Nong Shu of 1313 (although the earliest depiction of a winnowing machine was from a Han dynasty tomb model dated from the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 118.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, Plate CLVI. After these innovations, the windmill was finally introduced to China in the early 13th century via the Jin dynasty in northern China, during the late Song dynasty. The Persian scholar Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari wrote c. 850 that the earlier Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab was murdered in 644 by the technician Abu Lu'lu'a, who claimed to construct mills driven by the power of wind.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 556. More reliable than this account were the windmills of the Banu Musa brothers (850 to 870), while there are also several authors confirming the windmills of Sistan (Iran), written of by Abu Ishaq al-Istakhri and Abu al- Qasim ibn Hauqal.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 557. The northern Chinese under the rule of the Jurchen Jin dynasty became acquainted with the windmills of the Islamic world in the early 13th century. This is seen in an account of the Shu Zhai Lao Xue Cong Tan (Collected Talks of the Learned Old Man of the Shu Studio), written by Sheng Ruozi.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 560. It read: > In the collection of the private works of the 'Placid Retired Scholar' (Zhan > Ran Ju Shi), there are ten poems on Hechong Fu. One of these describes the > scenery of that place [‚Ä¶] and says that 'the stored wheat is milled by the > rushing wind and the rice is pounded fresh by hanging pestles. The > westerners (i.e. Turks) there use windmills (feng mo) just as the people of > the south (i.e. the Southern Song) use watermills (shui mo). And when they > pound they have the pesltes hanging vertically'. Here Sheng Ruozi quotes a written selection about windmills from the 'Placid Retired Scholar', who is actually Yel√º Chucai (1190‚Äì1244), a prominent Jin and Yuan statesman (after the Jin fell in 1234 to the Mongols). The passage refers to Yel√º's journey to Turkestan (modern Xinjiang) in 1219, and Hechong Fu is actually Samarkand (in modern Uzbekistan). Afterwards, the Chinese applied the 'fore-and-aft' sail riggings of typical Chinese junk ships to horizontal windmills.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 561. These windmills were used to operate the square-pallet chain pumps used in Chinese irrigation since the ancient Han dynasty.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 558. Windmills of this nature were still in use during modern times in Tianjin and along the Yangtze River. The first European to view Chinese windmills was Jan Nieuhoff, who spotted them in Jiangsu while traveling along the Grand Canal in 1656, as part of the Dutch embassy to Beijing. The first European windmills written of were those of Dean Herbert of East Anglia in 1191, who competed with the mills of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 555. After the windmill, wind power applications in other devices and even vehicles were found in China. There was the 'sailing carriage' that appeared by at least the Ming dynasty in the 16th century (although it could have been known beforehand). European travelers to China in the late 16th century were surprised to find large single-wheel passenger and cargo wheelbarrows not only pulled by mule or horse, but also mounted with ship-like masts and sails to help push them along by the wind.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 274‚Äì276. Archaeology During the early half of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), the study of archaeology developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies.Julius Thomas Fraser and Francis C. Haber, Time, Science, and Society in China and the West (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, , 1986), p. 227. This and the belief that ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007‚Äì1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze.Patricia B. Ebrey, The Cambridge Illustrated History of China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999, ), p. 148. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795‚Äì1886), some Song gentry‚Äîsuch as Zhao Mingcheng (1081‚Äì1129)‚Äîvalued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries.Rudolph, R.C. \\"Preliminary Notes on Sung Archaeology\\", The Journal of Asian Studies (Volume 22, Number 2, 1963): 169‚Äì177. Hong Mai (1123‚Äì1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100‚Äì1125). Geology and climatology Shen Kuo also made hypotheses in regards to geology and climatology in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. Shen believed that land was reshaped over time due to perpetual erosion, uplift, and deposition of silt, and cited his observance of horizontal strata of fossils embedded in a cliffside at Taihang as evidence that the area was once the location of an ancient seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles east over an enormous span of time.Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth (Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd., 1986) pp. 603‚Äì604, 618.Nathan Sivin, Science in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections.

Clancey, and Hui-Chieh Loy, Historical Perspectives on East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine (Singapore: Singapore University Press, 2002, ) p. 15. Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth (Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd., 1986) p. 618.

It illustrates the myth of Echo and Narcissus from Ovid's Metamorphoses. John William Waterhouse (1847‚Äì1917) was an English painter who, because of his style and themes, is generally classified as a Pre-Raphaelite. He painted over 200 works, mainly in the genres of classical mythology, and of historical or literary subjects. One of his common themes is the femme fatale, the woman who ensnares a man. In Ovid's version of the myth, Narcissus was the beautiful son of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope. His parents were told that he would live to an old age if he did not look at himself. He rejected all the nymphs and women who fell in love with him. One of these was the nymph Echo, who could only repeat the words of others. She was so upset by her rejection that she withdrew from life and wasted away until all that was left was a whisper. Her prayers were heard by the goddess Nemesis who caused Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. He continued to look at his reflection until he died. A narcissus flower grew on the spot where he died. The painting is set in an idyllic wooded landscape beside a stream with rocky edges. The youth Narcissus is lying prone, with his head over the water, fascinated by his own reflection. He is half-clad in a red robe, symbolising his flaming self-desire. The nymph Echo sits nearby across the stream, clasping a tree with her right hand, gazing at Narcissus in despair. She is symbolically separated from Narcissus, who does not look back towards her. Her cramped posture reflects her unrequited love. She is wearing a pink robe that has fallen off the left shoulder to reveal one breast; the milder pink of her robe reflects less passionate, smouldering love for Narcissus. Near her grow some yellow flag irises, Iris pseudacorus, and she wears a red poppy in her auburn hair. Some white narcissi have emerged from the grass beside the youth's foot, and a yellow water lily, Nuphar lutea, is in the water. The painting is in oils on canvas and it measures . It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1903. It forms part of the Victorian collection in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, having been purchased by the museum in 1903.

San Luis de la Paz was founded on August 25, 1552, as a defensive town on the Spanish Silver Road, which linked the Zacatecas mines with Mexico City during the Spanish domination. It owes its name to the peace treaty between Otomi Indians, who were Spaniard allies, and the native Chichimecas, on the day of Saint Louis of France, August 25. San Luis de la Paz is also known as the Chichimeca Nation.  Population data  The municipality lies adjacent to the southern border of the state of San Luis Potosi. The city serves as the seat of the municipality. At the Mexican census of 2009, the city had a population of 109,000 inhabitants. The municipality has an area of 2,030.14 km¬≤ (783.84 sq mi). Its largest other community is the town of Misi√≥n de Chichimecas. cuando naruto fund√≥ San Luis de la paz  Tourism  San Luis de la Paz is surrounded by many mountains and rock formations, like the Bernalejo hill and the Bridge of God. The Paso de Vaqueros Canyon is 30 minutes outside the town of San Luis de la Paz. The Manzanares and San Juan Rivers are inside the canyon. Paso de Vaqueros is sought for rappelling, bungee jumping, swimming, rock climbing and hiking.

Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the architecture of the period. The professions of architect, master craftsman, carpenter, and structural engineer did not have the high status of the Confucian scholar-officials during the dynastic era. Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years, usually from craftsman fathers to their sons. There were also government agencies and schools for construction, building, and engineering. The Song dynasty's building manuals aided not only the various private workshops, but also the craftsmen employed by the central government. City and palace A city gate of Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, built in 1223 during the Song Dynasty Bianjing city gate: detail from Along the River During the Qingming Festival by Zhang Zeduan The layout of ancient Chinese capitals, such as Bianjing, capital of the Northern Song, followed the guidelines in Kao Gong Ji, which specified a square city wall with several gates on each side and passageways for the emperor.ËÄÉÂ∑•ËÆ∞ Âå†‰∫∫Ëê•ÂõΩ P80 The outer city of ancient Bianjing was built during the reign of Emperor Shenzong to a rectangular plan, almost square in proportions, about from north to south and from west to east. The south wall had three gates, with Nanxun Gate in the center, Chenzhou Gate to the east, and Dailou Gate to the west. The other walls had four gates each: in the east wall were Dongshui Gate (at the southern end), Xinsong Gate, Xinchao Gate, and North-East Water Gate; in the west wall Xinzheng Gate, West Water Gate, Wansheng Gate, and Guzi Gate; and in the north wall Chenqiao Gate (at the eastern end), Fengqiu Gate, New Wild Jujube Gate and Weizhou Gate. The gates in the center of each of the four sides were reserved for the emperor; these gates had straight passages and only two sets of doors, while the other city gates had zigzag passages and were guarded by three sets of doors. The Song artist Zhang Zeduan's painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival depicts the Dongshui Gate in detail: the building on top had a five- ridged roof with a shallow slope in the Song dynasty style, supported prominently by two sets of brackets (dougong). The lower bracket assembly rested on the city gate to form a wooden foundation, while the upper assembly supported the roof, similar to the dougong in an extant Song building, the Goddess Temple in Taiyuan. This method of using bracket assemblies to support superstructure was specified in Li Jie's 12th-century building manual Yingzao Fashi as pingzuo (literally \\"flat base\\"). The city wall itself was built with rammed earth, a technique also detailed in Yingzao Fashi, vol. III, \\"Standards for Moat, Stronghold and Masonry Work\\": > Foundation: For every square chi, apply two dan of earth; on top of it lay a > mixture of broken brick, tile and crushed stones, also two dan. For every > five-cun layer of earth, two men, standing face to face, should tamp six > times with pestles, each man pounding three times on a dent; then tamp four > times on each dent, two men again standing face to face, each pounding twice > on the same dent; then tamp two more times, each man pounding once. > Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to > even out the surface. Every five-cun layer of earth should be compressed to > three cun; every three-cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun. Rammed-earth walls during this time were tapered: the thickness of the wall is greatest at the base and decreases steadily with increasing height, as detailed in Li Jie's book. During the Song dynasty, the city of Bianjing had three enclosures: the outer city wall, the inner city wall, and the palace at the center. The inner city was rectangular, with three doors on each side. The palace enclosure was also rectangular, with a watch tower on each of the four corners. It had four main gates: Xihua Gate to the west, Donghua Gate to the east, Gongchen Gate to the north, and Xuande Gate, also known as Duan Gate or Xuandelou, at the south. Xuande Gate had five-paneled doors, painted red and decorated with gold tacks; its walls were lavishly decorated with dragon, phoenix and floating-cloud patterns to match the carved beams, painted rafters and glazed-tile roof. There were also two glazed dragons, each biting an end of the rooftop ridge, its tail pointing to the sky. The symbolic function of these chi wei was explained in Yingzao Fashi: > There is a dragon in the East Sea, whose tail (wei) is similar to that of a > sparrow-hawk (chi); it stirs up waves and causes rainfall, so people put its > likeness on the rooftop to prevent fire. However, they misnamed it \\"sparrow- > hawk tail\\" (chi wei). Running southward from Xuande Gate was the Imperial Boulevard, about two hundred paces wide, with the Imperial Corridors on either side. Merchants opened shops in the Corridors until 1112, when they were banned. Two rows of black fencing were placed at the center of the boulevard as a barrier to pedestrians and carriages. Along the inner sides of the fences ran the brick- lined Imperial Water Furrows, filled with lotus. About south from Xuande Gate, the Bian River intercepted the Imperial Boulevard, which crossed it over the stone Zhou Bridge, balustraded and flat-decked. This design of a boulevard with a stone bridge crossing a river was later imitated in the Forbidden City. During spring and summer, mingled peach, plum, pear and apricot trees adorned the banks of the Bian with a variety of flowers. Buddhist pagodas The Yunyan Pagoda, in height, built in 961 AD. The Liaodi Pagoda of Hebei, built in 1055 under the Northern Song Following the reign of the Han dynasty, (202 BC‚Äì220 AD), the idea of the Buddhist stupa entered Chinese culture, as a means to house and protect scriptural sutras. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, the distinctive Chinese pagoda was developed, its predecessors being the tall watch towers and towering residential apartments of the Han dynasty (as inferred from models in Han-era tombs).Needham, Volume 4, 128. During the Sui (581‚Äì618) and Tang (618‚Äì907) periods, Chinese pagodas were developed from purely wooden structures to use articulated stone and brick, which could more easily survive fires caused by lightning or arson and were less susceptible to decay. The earliest brick pagoda that remains extant is the Songyue Pagoda, built in 523, and a typical example of a Tang-era stone pagoda is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, constructed in 652. Although Buddhist influences on China waned after the late Tang period, numerous Buddhist pagoda towers were built during the Song dynasty. Tall Chinese pagodas were often built in the countryside rather than within a city's walls, largely to avoid competition with the cosmic-imperial authority embodied in the cities' drum- and gate-towers.Needham, Volume 4, 137. The Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, built in a city ward of what was southeastern Chang'an, is among the exceptions. The Iron Pagoda of Youguo Temple in Kaifeng earned its name from the iron-grey color of the glazed bricks forming the tower. Originally built of wood by the architect Yu Hao, it was struck by lightning and burned down in 1044, during the Northern Song period. In 1049 the pagoda was rebuilt as it appears today, under the order of Emperor Renzong of Song. This 13-story pagoda, structured on an octagonal base, is tall.Chinadaily.com.cn (2003).Iron Pagoda . Ministry of Culture. Retrieved on 2007-03-29. Its glazed tile bricks feature carved artwork of dancing figures, solemn ministers, and Buddhist themes (see gallery below). The period also featured true cast-iron pagodas, such as the Iron Pagoda of Yuquan Temple (Jade Springs Temple), Dangyang, Hubei Province. Built in 1061, it incorporates of cast iron and stands tall.Needham, Volume 4, 141‚Äì142. Imitating contemporary wooden, stone, and brick pagodas, the pagoda features sloping eaves and an octagonal base.China.org.cn Iron Pagoda at Yuquan Temple in Dangyang of Hubei Province. China Internet Information Center. Retrieved on 2007-03-29. Another iron pagoda was constructed in 1105, Jining, Shandong, and was cast layer by layer in octagonal sections, standing 78 feet high. Several such cast iron pagodas exist in China today. The Liuhe Pagoda, or Six Harmonies Pagoda, is another example of Song-era pagoda architecture. It is located in the Southern Song capital of Hangzhou, in Zhejiang Province, at the foot of Yuelun Hill facing the Qiantang River. Although the original was destroyed in 1121, the current tower was erected in 1156 and fully restored by 1165. It stands tall, and was constructed from a red brick frame with 13 stages of wooden eaves. Because of its size, the pagoda served as a permanent lighthouse to aid sailors at night (as described in Hangzhou Fu Zhi).Needham, Volume 4, 662. The Zhengjue Temple Pagoda in Pengxian County of Sichuan Province (near Chengdu) is a brick pagoda that was built between 1023 and 1026, according to inscriptions running along its first storey. It has a square base on a sumeru pedestal, thirteen stories totaling in height, and multiple layers of eaves similar in style to the earlier Tang pagodas of Chang'an, the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda and the Small Wild Goose Pagoda. Wood-and-brick hybrid pagodas were also built. The first four floors of the octagonal, Lingxiao Pagoda of 1045 are brick (with wooden eaves), while from the fifth floor up it is entirely made of wood. Even pagodas made of stone or brick featured architectural elements that were typical of Chinese wooden buildings; for example the Pizhi Pagoda, built from 1056 to 1063, uses the dougong brackets typical of wooden architecture to hold up pent, shingled roofs and tiers. Both of these pagodas feature interior staircases, although the Lingxiao Pagoda's only reaches to the fourth floor, and the Pizhi Pagoda's to the fifth. However, the Pizhi Pagoda features winding exterior stairs that provide access to the ninth and topmost floor. Although the Pagoda of Fogong Temple is the tallest extant wooden pagoda, the tallest Chinese pagoda built in the dynastic era that remains standing is the Liaodi Pagoda. Completed in 1055, it is tall, with an octagonal base on a large platform, surpassing the Qianxun Pagoda, which had held the record since its construction in the 9th century by the Kingdom of Dali. Although the Liaodi Pagoda served its religious purpose as a Buddhist landmark in the Kaiyuan Monastery of Ding County, Hebei province, its great height gave it another valuable function, as a military watch tower that was used to observe movements of the Liao enemy.Liaodi Pagoda at Kaiyuan Temple in Dingzhou of Hebei Province. From China.org.cn. Retrieved on 2008-02-12. Beside their utility in surveillance, pagoda towers could also serve as astronomical observatories; one such is the Gaocheng Astronomical Observatory, built in 1276 and still standing today. File:Zhengding Lingxiao Pagoda 1.jpgalt=A wide, octagonal pagoda. It has four tall, functional floors made of brick, and an additional five, short, purely decorative floors made of wood. Each floor is separated by an eave, and the top five floor's eaves look as if they were simply stacked right on top of one another.Lingxiao Pagoda in Zhengding, Hebei Province, is a tall wood-and- brick hybrid pagoda.

File:Wuhan Wuying Ta 2012.11.21 10-44-59.jpgWuying Pagoda (Shadowless Pagoda) in Wuhan, built in 1270 during the Mongol Invasion of the Southern Song Temples Temple of the Saintly Mother, Jinsi, Taiyuan, built in 1032 Trinity Hall of Xuanmiao Temple, Suzhou It was not uncommon for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating a portion of their family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (Ë≤ª) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion on their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly after the fall of the Song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire. Apart from stimulating the development of urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features. The Temple of the Saintly Mother (Âú£ÊØçÊÆø) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (ÊôãÁ•†), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture.Liang Sicheng, A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture: A study of the Development of its Structural System and the Evolution of its Types, p 210-221. . The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting the ends of the main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture.Liang Ssu-Cheng, Chinese Architecture Monumental Timber-Frame Buildings, The columns of the fa√ßade, decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts, become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has a porch around it, the sole example of such a structure; another unique feature of the site is a cross-shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple. The Trinity Hall of Xuan Miao Temple (ÁéÑÂ¶ôËßÇ), situated in the heart of Suzhou city, is another example of Song architecture. In 1982, it was established as a National Heritage Site by the Chinese government. The Jingling Palace (ÊôØÁÅµÂÆ´, Jingling Gong), a temple to the legendary Yellow Emperor located near modern- day Qufu, was built in the 11th century. It was subsequently destroyed near the end of the Yuan dynasty. However, several other structures in Shou Qiu, the complex that Jingling Palace was situated in, remain intact. Two giant tortoise-borne steles flank what was the entrance to the palace. One of the two steles, the Stele of the Sorrow of 10,000, is at high, the tallest unmarked stele in the country. A large pyramid constructed of rounded stone blocks, the symbolic tomb of the Yellow Emperor's son Shaohao, is located outside the Shou Qiu complex. Another important large tortoise-borne stele of the same period has been preserved at the Dai Miao of Mount Tai. Bridges The Lugou Bridge (Marco Polo Bridge), originally built from 1189 to 1192, and reconstructed in 1698 Bridges over waterways had been known in China since the ancient Zhou dynasty. During the Song dynasty, large trestle bridges were constructed, such as that built by Zhang Zhongyan in 1158.Needham, Volume 4, 150. There were also large bridges made entirely of stone, like the Ba Zi Bridge of Shaoxing, built in 1256 and still standing today.Needham, Volume 4, 153. Bridges with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of Xia Gui (1195‚Äì1224). Long, covered corridor bridges, like the 12th-century Rainbow Bridge in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, which has wide stone-based piers and a wooden superstructure, were also built. While serving as an administrator for Hangzhou, the poet Su Shi (1037‚Äì1101) had a large pedestrian causeway built across the West Lake, which still bears his name: Sudi (ËòáÂ†§). In 1221, the Taoist traveler Qiu Changchun visited Genghis Khan in Samarkand, describing various Chinese bridges encountered on the way there through the Tian Shan Mountains, east of Yining. The historian Joseph Needham quotes him as saying: > [The road had] \\"no less than 48 timber bridges of such width that two carts > can drive over them side by side\\". It had been built by Chang Jung [Zhang > Rong] and the other engineers of the Chagatai some years before. The wooden > trestles of Chinese bridges from the ‚àí3rd century [BC] onwards were no doubt > similar to those supposed to have been employed in Julius Caesar's bridge of > ‚àí55 [BC] across the Rhine, or drawn by Leonardo, or found in use in Africa. > But where in +13th century [AD] Europe could a two-lane highway like Chang > Jung's have been found?Needham, Volume 4, 151. In Fujian Province, enormous beam bridges were built during the Song dynasty. Some of these were as long as , with individual spans of up to in length; their construction necessitated moving massive stones of . No names of the engineers were recorded or appear in the inscriptions on the bridges, which give only the names of local officials who sponsored them and oversaw their construction and repair. However, there might have been an engineering school in Fujian, headed by a prominent engineer known as Cai Xiang (1012‚Äì1067), who had risen to the position of governmental prefect in Fujian. Between 1053 and 1059, he planned and supervised the construction of the large Wanan Bridge (once called the Luoyang Bridge) near Quanzhou (on the border of the present- day Luojiang District and Huai'an County. This bridge, a stone structure similar to a number of other bridges found in Fujian, still stands, and features ship-like piers bound to their bases using mucilage from oysters as an adhesive.Luoyang Bridge . From chinaculture.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-11. It is in length, in width, and in height. Another famous bridge near Quanzhou, the Anping Bridge, was constructed between 1138 and 1151. Other examples of Song bridges include Guyue Bridge, a stone arch bridge in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province. The bridge was built in 1213, the sixth year of the Jiading Era in the Southern Song dynasty. Song-era pontoon bridges include the Dongjin Bridge, 400 m ( mi) long, which may still be seen today. Tombs of the Northern Song emperors Statues along a spirit road of the Northern Song tomb complex. Frescoes and dougong bracket sets from the tomb of Song Silang, Northern Song dynasty, located in Luoyang Located southwest of Gongyi city in Henan province, the large tombs of the Northern Song number about one thousand, including individual tombs for Song emperors, empresses, princes, princesses, consorts, and members of the extended family. The complex extends approximately from east to west and from north to south. The construction of the complex began in 963 AD, during the reign of the first Song ruler, Emperor Taizu of Song, whose father is also buried at the site.Steinhardt (1993), 374. The only Northern Song emperors not buried there are Emperor Huizong of Song and Emperor Qinzong of Song, who died in captivity after the Jurchen invasion of northern China in 1127. Lining the spirit ways of the tomb complex are hundreds of Song sculptures and statues of tigers, rams, lions, horses with grooms, horned beasts and mythical creatures, government officials, military generals, foreign ambassadors, and others featured in an enormous display of Song-era artwork. The layout and style of the Song tombs resemble those found in the contemporary Tangut kingdom of the Western Xia, which also had an auxiliary burial site associated with each tomb. At the center of each burial site is a truncated pyramidal tomb, each having once been guarded by a four- walled enclosure with four centered gates and four corner towers.Steinhardt (1993), 375. About from Gongxian is the Baisha Tomb, which contains \\"elaborate facsimiles in brick of Chinese timber frame construction, from door lintels to pillars and pedestals to bracket sets, that adorn interior walls.\\" The Baisha Tomb has two large separate chambers with conical domed ceilings; a large staircase leads down to the entrance doors of the subterranean tomb.Steinhardt (1993), 376. Literature The Iron Pagoda of Kaifeng, built in 1049, tall. It was constructed after Yu Hao's wooden pagoda was destroyed by lightning. During the Song dynasty, previous works on architecture were brought to more sophisticated levels of description, as in Yili Shigong, written by Li Ruogui in 1193 AD.Needham, Volume 4, 81. One of the most definitive works, however, was the earlier Mu Jing (\\"Timberwork Manual\\"), ascribed to Yu Hao and written sometime between 965 and 995. Yu Hao was responsible for the construction of a wooden pagoda tower in Kaifeng, which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick Iron Pagoda soon after. In his time, books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft's status, so Mu Jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography.Needham, Volume 4, 82. Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it as a work of architectural genius, saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work.Needham, Volume 4, 84. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind, and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the crossbeams, the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.Needham, Volume 4, 141. Needham, Volume 4, 82‚Äì84 Several years later Li Jie (ÊùéË™°; 1065‚Äì1110) published Yingzao Fashi (\\"Treatise on Architectural Methods\\" or \\"State Building Standards\\").Guo, 1. Although similar books came before it, such as Yingshan Ling (\\"National Building Law\\") of the early Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907),Guo, 1‚Äì3. Li's book is the earliest technical manual on Chinese architecture to have survived in full. Yingzao Fashi Diagram of corbel brackets from the cross-section of a hall, from Li Jie's Yingzao Fashi, published in 1103 Yingzao Fashi is a technical treatise on architecture and craftsmanship written by Li Jie, an architect and official at the Directorate of Buildings and Construction. Li completed the book in 1100, and presented it to Emperor Zhezong of Song in the last year of his reign. His successor, Emperor Huizong of Song, had Li's treatise officially published three years later, in 1103, for the benefit of foremen, architects, and literate craftsmen. The book was intended to provide standard regulations, to not only the engineering agencies of the central government, but also the many workshops and artisan families throughout China who could benefit from using a well-written government manual on building practices. Yingzao Fashi included building codes and regulations, accounting information, descriptions of construction materials, and classification of crafts.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 84‚Äì85. In its 34 chapters, the book outlined units of measurement, and the construction of moats, fortifications, stonework, and woodwork.Needham, Volume 4, 85 For the latter, it included specifications for making bracketing units with inclined arms and joints for columns and beams.Guo, 2. It also provided specifications for wood carving, drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, and decoration. The book contained recipes for decorative paints, glazes, and coatings, also listing proportions for mixing mortars used in masonry,.Guo, 5. brickwork, and manufacture of glazed tiles, illustrating practices and standards with drawings. His book outlined structural carpentry in great detail, providing standard dimensional measurements for all components used;.Guo, 6. here he developed a standard eight-grade system for sizing timber elements, known as the cai-fen system of units, which could be universally applied in buildings.Guo, 6‚Äì7. About 8% of Li Jie's book was derived from pre-existing written material on architecture, while the majority of the book documented the inherited traditions of craftsmen and architects.Guo, 4. The Yingzao Fashi provided a full glossary of technical terms that included mathematical formulae, building proportions, and construction techniques, and discussed the implications of the local topography for construction at a particular site. He also estimated the monetary costs of hiring laborers of different skill levels from various crafts on the basis of a day's work, in addition to the price of the materials they would need and according to the season in which they were to be employed.

Idis about 14 km northeast of Avanos in Nev≈üehir Province, in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey. Description The city has many strata made up of volcanic granite. Its larger areas are connected to each other by tunnels, and it contains a pipe communication system reaching each of its levels. This feature is unique when compared to the Kaymaklƒ± Underground City and the Derinkuyu Underground City. Each carved room had ventilation provided by further piping when the city was sealed during sieges. History The city was probably built by the people of Byzantine Cappadocia, although the age is uncertain and could be older. The √ñzkonak Underground City was discovered in 1972 by a local farmer named Latif Acar, who was curious about where his excess crop water was disappearing to. Latif discovered an underground room which, when later excavated, revealed a whole city which could house 60,000 people for up to three months. Although only four floors are now open, the complex contains a total of ten floors, to a depth of 40m. Unlike the other underground cities in this area, there were holes above the tunnels used for dumping hot oil on the enemy. Just like Kaymaklƒ± and Derinkuyu, √ñzkonak has a water well, ventilation system, winery and moving stone doors.

Five wards of Fukuoka city border on the bay, which is sometimes labeled \\"Fukuoka Bay\\" on maps. Sometimes, the bay is divided into Hakata, Fukuoka, and Imazu Bays, though for simplicity's sake, the term \\"Hakata Bay\\" is commonly used as a catch-all to refer to all three. The bay is roughly 10 km from north to south, and 20 km from east to west, covering an area of roughly 133 km¬≤. The coastline stretches 128 km. The mouth of the bay is only 7.7 km wide, shielding it to a great extent from the waves of the Strait. The bay is only 10 metres deep on average, 23 m at its deepest point, though the tides bring a two-metre change in the water level. Set routes are used, therefore, through the bay, to protect ships' drafts. Land reclamation began to be undertaken before the Meiji period, and continued into the post-war period. Since 1945, 1167 square kilometres of land have been reclaimed from the bay, primarily to improve or reinforce the effective functioning of the port. In 1994, an artificial island was begun to be created and called \\"Island City\\" („Ç¢„Ç§„É©„É≥„Éâ„Ç∑„ÉÜ„Ç£, Airandoshiti). Some particular petrified trees in the area are said to have been the masts of ships used in Empress Jing≈´'s third century invasion of Korea. Veins of mica and pegmatite under the bay, part of a geologic fault, are under governmental protection. Much of the area is included in the Genkai National Park, and efforts are made to maintain and preserve the natural features and environment both in the bay and on its islands. Though much of the shoreline is natural, some parts, particularly in and around the port itself, are artificial and developed upon; the bay's shoreline was, somewhat crudely, officially designated as natural wilderness and parkland. Islands A number of small islands are contained either within the bay or around it. *Hashima (Á´ØÂ≥∂, Ha Island) *Island City („Ç¢„Ç§„É©„É≥„Éâ„Ç∑„ÉÜ„Ç£) *Mishima (Âæ°Â≥∂, Mi Island) *Noko-no-shima (ËÉΩÂè§Â≥∂, Noko Island) *Shika-no-shima (ÂøóË≥ÄÂ≥∂, Shika Island) *Ugu-shima (ÈµúÊù•Â≥∂, Ugu Island) *H≈ç-jima (ÂÆùÂ≥∂, H≈ç Island) History The bay and its surrounding settlements were active and significant locations as early as the 3rd century and the Kofun period. Many historical figures of great significance passed through or lived in Hakata, and many major events occurred there. The ruins of Fukuoka Castle lie along the bay, and an active port has existed there for many centuries. The area is said to have been recognized by China as early as 57 CE. Emperor Guangwu of Han is believed to have bestowed a Golden Seal to the local leaders, acknowledging (or granting) their authority over the area then called Na no kuni (Â•¥ÂõΩ, Na Country or Na Province). Emissaries from the Chinese kingdom of Cao Wei arrived in the 3rd century, and Empress Jing≈´ is said to have launched her invasion of Korea from this port. By the 7th century, Hakata was the port through which official missions to T'ang China were sent and received. Following the defeat of Yamato (Japan) and Baekche in the battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, fears arose of invasions from Silla and China, and areas around the bay were fortified. The first mention of the area (by the name Chikushi) in the Nihon Shoki corresponds to this time period. K≈´kai was one of many famous people who journeyed to China through this port. In 806, he returned to Japan and founded T≈çch≈ç-ji Temple nearby. Sugawara no Michizane, after having been ambassador to China, and holding a number of other high posts at Court in Kyoto, was demoted to a post in Hakata in 901. Fujiwara no Sumitomo, having opposed Taira no Masakado's rebellion in 939, fled to Hakata two years later, where he was captured and killed. As the closest major bay and port to mainland Asia in Japan, Hakata has played a major role in diplomacy and trade with Korea and China throughout much of history. This also made it, however, a key point of attack for attempts to invade the Japanese islands. In the Toi Invasion of 1019, Jurchens seized several nearby islands, using them as bases from which to raid and attack Hakata. Mongol emissaries first arrived in 1268, and all the samurai armies of Ky≈´sh≈´ was mobilized in anticipation of the first of the Mongol invasions of Japan, which came six years later. Kublai Khan's forces seized Tsushima and Iki Island before landing on the shores of Hakata Bay on November 19. The invaders were eventually repelled, and extensive fortification efforts were undertaken in the ensuing years. The second invasion arrived in 1281, and was similarly repelled. Though referred to in Japanese as the battles of Bun'ei and K≈çan (ÊñáÊ∞∏„Å®ÂºòÂÆâ„ÅÆÂΩπ), both of these invasion attempts are frequently referred to in English sources as the \\"Battle of Hakata Bay.\\" In April 1336, at Tadara-no- hama on the bay, Ashikaga Takauji led a force against the Kikuchi clan, allies of Go-Daigo, led by Kikuchi Taketoshi. Victorious, Takauji \\"at one stroke the Ashikaga leader became virtually master of Kyushi.\\" Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier arrived in Hakata in 1550, introducing Christianity to Japan. Ky≈´sh≈´ would be the center of Christianity in Japan for several decades, as a number of daimy≈ç (feudal lords) and their subjects converted. Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded the island in 1587, and banished the missionaries, outlawing Christianity as a threat to his power. Through the Edo period (1603-1868), Hakata handled only for domestic trade, as international trade or travel was forbidden by the Tokugawa shogunate except at designated ports. Hakata reopened to international trade in 1899. Following the end of World War II, this was one of the primary ports through which Japanese soldiers and civilian residents of the colonies were repatriated. Hakata remained an important port throughout the post-war period, and still serves this function today.

The title \\"Working for Peanuts\\", which is a common expression to indicate earning low wages, is used to allude to the development in the story related to the elephant's peanuts. Plot While collecting acorns, Chip 'n' Dale discover a peanut that had been thrown from the nearby zoo. At the zoo, guests give out peanuts to the animals, and Donald Duck takes care of Dolores the Elephant. Chip 'n' Dale take the Elephants peanuts, but Dolores won't let them. Trying to escape from Donald, Dale trips in a bucket of white paint, covering himself in it. This gives Chip an idea. Smiling, he says, \\"I've got an idea! Listen to this!\\" before grabbing Dale's ear and beginning to whisper in it. He whispers his plan in Dale's ear. While he is whispering, Dale listens closely and begins to smile, liking Chip's plan. He continues to smile as Chip continues to whisper. When he has finished whispering, he grabs the paintbrush and begins to cover Dale in paint. Together, the two cover themselves in the white paint and successfully convince Donald that they belong in an albino chipmunk exhibit at the zoo, where they are fed peanuts. In this film, for the first time Chip has been slapped with a fish by Dale, usually the other way round.

It was constructed and utilized by the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories as part of its BW research program from 1951 to 1969. It is the largest aerobiology chamber ever constructed and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The structure The stainless steel test sphere, a cloud chamber used to study static microbial aerosols, is a four-story high, 131-ton structure. Its , carbon steel hull was designed to withstand the internal detonation of \\"hot\\" biological bombs without risk to outsiders. It was originally contained within a cubical brick building. Its purpose was the study of infectious agent aerosols and testing of pathogen-filled munitions. The device was designed to allow exposure of animals and humans to carefully controlled numbers of organisms by an aerosol (inhalational) route. Live, tethered animals were inserted into the chamber along with BW bombs for exposure tests. Human volunteers breathed metered aerosols of Q fever or tularemia organisms through ports along the perimeter of the sphere. History (1947-1969) The bottom of the sphere, in use Herbert G. Tanner, the head of Camp (now Fort) Detrick's Munitions Division, had envisioned an enclosed environment where biological tests could be conducted on site, rather than at remote places like Dugway Proving Ground, Utah and Horn Island, Mississippi. The facility was constructed during 1947 and 1948 and became operational at Camp Detrick in 1950. The test sphere was utilized during the Operation Whitecoat studies (1954‚Äì73), the first exposure taking place on January 25, 1955. History (1969-present day) The test sphere has not been used since 1969, when the US offensive BW program was disestablished by President Nixon. The brick building housing the test sphere was destroyed by fire in 1974. However, the chamber itself was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

It was directed by Tay Garnett and stars Martha Scott in the title role. The other cast members include William Gargan, Edmund Gwenn, Sterling Holloway, Dorothy Peterson, Marsha Hunt, Don Douglas, and Sidney Blackmer. This film marked the debut of Rosemary DeCamp. Cheers for Miss Bishop was produced by Richard A. Rowland and released through United Artists. Plot Miss Ella Bishop (Martha Scott) is a teacher at Midwestern University. The story is told in flashback and takes place over many years, from the 1880s to the 1930s, showing her from her freshman year to her retirement as an old woman. At the beginning, she lives with her mother and her vixenish cousin Amy (Mary Anderson); she remembers when her father had a farm near the town. Ella is an inhibited girl whose frustration grows as she approaches womanhood. She dreams of becoming a teacher. When she graduates from Midwestern University, she is thrilled when its president, Professor Corcoran (Edmund Gwenn), offers her a position on the faculty. Ella becomes engaged to lawyer Delbert Thompson (Don Douglas), but Delbert is led astray by Amy and eventually has to marry her, despite loving Ella. The couple move away. After Amy becomes pregnant, Delbert abandons her. Amy dies in childbirth, leaving Ella to care for Amy's daughter Hope (Marsha Hunt). Hope grows up and marries Richard (John Archer), and they move away and have a daughter named Gretchen (Lois Ranson). Ella also has a fling with another teacher, the unhappily married John Stevens (Sidney Blackmer), but John's wife cannot give him a divorce for religious reasons, forcing Ella to break off the relationship. Later, she is distressed to learn that John has been killed. Through all the years, Ella is supported by her friend Sam Peters (William Gargan), a local grocer who loves her. Another source of support is Professor Corcoran, who persuades her to stay when she considers leaving. His death is a blow to Ella. As Ella reaches old age, she reflects back and realizes she allowed the years to go by without achieving what she believes to be true fulfillment. When the new president pressures her to finally retire, she agrees. However, the years have not been without glory; and her moment of triumph arrives when her numerous, now-famous students from over the years return to a testimonial dinner at the school to honor their beloved Miss Bishop.

The film begins with Sam and Ella in their older ages, leading Ella into flashbacks of her life, each marked with autobiographical voice-overs, from her graduation at Midwestern University in the 1880s to her retirement in the 1930s. The director uses fading transitions to symbolize the change in time. The makeup director, Don L. Cash, ably aged the actors distinctly through decades. Another technology the cinematographer used was dollies, to capture moving motion and to zoom out of scenes.  Adaptations  Cheers for Miss Bishop was adapted as a radio play on the March 17, 1941, broadcast of Lux Radio Theater with Martha Scott and William Gargan reprising their film roles and on the November 6, 1946, broadcast of Academy Award Theater starring Olivia de Havilland. Scott also reprised the role in a radio adaptation for Hallmark Playhouse in 1949. Awards Cheers for Miss Bishop earned Edward Ward an Academy Award nomination for Best Scoring of a Dramatic Film.

Named for Edward Blyth, the species has also been known as Alcedo grandis and as the great blue kingfisher. Between long, the kingfisher has deep rufous underparts with a blackish blue breast patch, and brilliant cobalt blue or azure upperparts, tinged with purple. The wings are a dark blackish green, with blue speckles and tips to some of the feathers. The bill of the male is entirely black, while the female has a dark red lower mandible. The species is distinguished from the similar blue-eared kingfisher (Alcedo meninting) and common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) by its greater size, heavy black bill, and dark lores. The species breeds between the months of March and June. It builds nests at the end of tunnels dug in the banks of streams or ravines. Four to six eggs are laid, with both sexes incubating. A shy bird, it frequents small waterways, feeding on fish and insects caught by diving from a shrub close to the water. It is found along streams in evergreen forest and adjacent open country between , mainly between . The species ranges from Nepal through India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Even within its preferred habitat the density of the species is low, and the population, though not thoroughly surveyed, is believed to be small, and declining further. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies it as \\"near threatened\\". Taxonomy Blyth's kingfisher was described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1845 and given the binomial name Alcedo grandis. Unfortunately, this name was preoccupied as it had already been introduced for another species by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his Systema naturae of 1788. In 1917, the German naturalist Alfred Laubmann proposed the binomial name Alcedo hercules to replace the preoccupied name chosen by Blyth. The common name commemorates Edward Blyth (1810‚Äì1873), who was the curator of the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Blyth's kingfisher is most closely related to the blue- eared kingfisher (Alcedo meninting). The species is monotypic. It has also been referred to as the great blue kingfisher. Description Blyth's kingfisher is between in length, making it the largest of the Alcedo kingfishers. The wing of the male is between long, and that of the female between . On the male, the feathering on the head is black, with shiny tips of bright blue. It has a neck patch that is whitish or buff in colour, as is the chin. The breast and belly are rufous, except for a dark blackish-blue patch on the breast. The legs and feet of the bird are also red. The bill is entirely black in the male, while the female has a red base to the mandible. The iris of the bird is reddish brown. The lores of the bird are black, and have a buff coloured streak above them. The back of the bird from mantle to the tail coverts is a bright cobalt blue or azure, with a tinge of purple towards the rump and the tail coverts. When the bird is at rest, the upper parts may appear brownish black. The tail itself is a darker ultramarine blue. The wings and the scapular feathers are a dark greenish black. The feathers of the upperwing coverts have cobalt-blue tips, while the underwing coverts are dark rufous-red. The lesser and median coverts have prominent speckles of cobalt. Any distinctive features in the plumage of the juvenile are not known. The species is morphologically similar to the blue-eared kingfisher (Alcedo meninting), but in comparison is substantially larger. Its bill is heavier and longer than that of the blue-eared kingfisher, and is entirely black. Its crown and wings are less brilliant as those of the smaller bird, and it may be distinguished by the speckles of light blue on its crown and wing coverts. The dark ear coverts set it apart from the common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), which has rufous ear-coverts. It is similar to the female blue-banded kingfisher (Alcedo euryzona), but the two species do not overlap in their range. The call of the species is described as a loud \\"pseet\\", less shrill but louder and more hoarse than that of the common kingfisher, and similar but louder to that of the blue-eared kingfisher. One of the calls made by the slaty-backed forktail (Enicurus schistaceus) is sometimes mistaken for the call of Blyth's kingfisher. Behavior and ecology Blyth's kingfisher feeding, painted in 1897 The breeding period of Blyth's kingfisher is chiefly between April and May, extending to March and June. The nests are built at the end of a tunnel in a muddy bank, next to either a stream or a ravine in the forest. The tunnel extends straight, then rises, before descending to the chamber in which the nest is. This chamber is between wide and high. The width of the tunnel is typically : the length varies with the soil, ranging from in hard soil to in sandy soil. Between four and six eggs are laid, incubated by both parents. The parents sit very tight; nests become covered in faecal matter. The periods of incubation and fledging are not known. The species feeds on fish and insects it catches by diving in water bodies. Unlike other Alcedo kingfishers, Blyth's kingfisher dives from a shrub close above the water, rather than from an exposed vantage point. The species is presumed not to migrate. It is described as a shy bird. Habitat and distribution Blyth's kingfisher frequents small rivers and waterways in evergreen forest, hilly regions, or deep ravines. It is sometimes found near streams near well- wooded farmland. Its elevational range is chiefly between above sea level, extending to a minimum of and a maximum of . The density of the species is low across its range. In China, it is known to be found in the Mengyang Nature Reserve in Yunnan, and in the Nonggang National Nature Reserve and Diding Nature Reserve in Guangxi province. It is also known to be present in Hainan. In Vietnam the species is found in Annam and western Tonkin, in which regions it is fairly common. In northern Laos and the Annamite mountains, it may be locally common. It is also found in Myanmar, where its density varies considerably, and is either a visitor or a rare resident in northwestern Thailand. It is rare in Bhutan in northeastern India, and a vagrant in Bangladesh and eastern Nepal. Its range in northeast India includes the eastern Himalayas, up to . Status and conservation The population of Blyth's kingfisher has not been quantified globally. In China, the species is estimated to have fewer than 100 breeding pairs. The species occurs at a low density even within a favorable habitat. The habitats it favors are being degraded and fragmented by human activity. Other potential threats to the species include water pollution in the rivers it inhabits and anthropogenic disturbance such as deforestation. No specific conservation actions are known to have been taken to protect the species. Due to the presence of human disturbance, its population is thought to be in slow decline. The International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes the species as \\"near threatened\\"; it has previously classified the species as \\"vulnerable.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Oriental Bird Images: Blyth's Kingfisher Selected images Blyth's kingfisher Category:Birds of Hainan Category:Birds of Northeast India Category:Birds of Southeast Asia Blyth's kingfisher ","title":"Blyth's kingfisher"},{"id":"10444411","text":"Store Austanbotntind (official form on maps Store Austanbotntinden) is a mountain on the border of the municipalities of Luster and √Ördal in Vestland county, Norway.

The village was once home to an ancient castle and port which have since been lost to modern development (though artifacts, such as Phoenician burial pots, were recovered by private collectors in the early 20th century during said modern construction). Currently, Tabarja is a village that's faltering economy is mostly based in the hospitality industry, standing host to a variety of resorts, restaurants and seaside attractions as well as unique architecture dating back centuries Background The main attraction of the town is its picturesque fishing port where Saint Paul is said to have set sail on one of his missionary trips to Europe. One of the modern beach resorts, a Brutalist masterpiece, built near the port is named in honor of Saint Paul and currently towers over the bay. The other resorts in the town are named after another local figure, King Bargis, whose castle they are built atop of, alongside the local church. The Triple church of St. George is a popular historic Maronitic site in the town and features an ossuary with the town's individual family crypts as well as elaborate statuary and engravings. The religious structure is over a century old and was built on a pagan site, Phoenician and Roman, referenced as a possible altar to Adonis or another local deity. Large Roman stones are still visible today in the walls of the church, as well as undated stones featuring Rabbullah Maronite Crosses that possibly date to the Crusades. A sea level cave not too far from the church is also named in honor of Saint George, but has been severely damaged over the years due to modernization and land disputes. This rock formation among the unique limestone rock formations on the coast had been considered sacred for centuries, and sick infants were brought by their mothers for immersion in the salt water of the cave in order to receive a supernatural cure through Saint George. As of 2019, an extensive site of Byzantine ruins have been discovered under the village. Extending for miles under the farmlands and more recent construction, the indication seems to be that Tabarja was once relatively large. The question remains, however, as to why it was abandoned as most of the modern village dates only to the latter half of the 20th century. Throughout most of its modern history, the village had been home to only a hundred or so people, mostly under unofficial fealty to the \\"Rayyis'aa\\" of the House of El Azzi (Which has long since lost its status as anything more than a historic relic). Either through natural disaster, or possibly as a result of the Crusades, the old and fairly metropolitan port city that rests below Tabarja was abandoned almost entirely.Tabarja, Lebanon Tabarja is also home to a variety of hidden Greco-Roman vaults, and the Tabarja Bay is also home to numerous underwater caves and a freshwater current from an unknown source. The town also features a unique limestone and mortar sewer system built by the French and expanded by the local municipality at the turn of the century. It is also one of the few towns in the world to still feature a fully functioning and integrated Ottoman-style aqueduct system that services the older limestone homes and the extensive farmlands to the Southwest. The town once also featured a railway that passed through the main street, which was operational until the early 1990s but has since been damaged by rampant modernization and a lack of firm regulations after the war. The town also houses various examples of 19th century and earlier Lebanese homes, the Second El Azzi Home of the 19th century is of architectural relevance and is built on a cliffside using mortar and limestone stilts which once bordered with the local bay but has been encroached upon by modern construction, even topped with a recent structure of unrelated ownership, and converted to an inn. Local oral tradition states that said house was built over a chest of gold coins, and that a long dead apparition of the El Azzi family appears at the equinox to point in the direction of the buried gold of the once powerful nautical family. The town at one point also featured old salt evaporation ponds on its South-West coastline, but they have since been destroyed and replaced with modern construction or simply paved over. The town also featured a very small undated mortar lighthouse, which was recently demolished by a tidal wave. It was thought to date back to at least the time in which ship-bound trading was common in the area, which ended around the early 20th century and spans back millennia, and once operated via a kerosene and later electric torch. The lighthouse was built atop the relatively vast and unique rock formations that border most of the town's coastline. Tabarja today, as mentioned above, is a popular summer resort town among Lebanese families and foreigners alike, Tabarja Beach in particular features a dramatic deep-water cove dominated by a 14th-century watch tower, though this is located on the outskirts of the town and not the bay itself. Whereas near the Tabarja Bay or Saint Paul's Bay, King Bargis I, King Bargis II, Saint Paul's Resort, El Mina Restaurant and other long-existing establishment complement the local flavour. El Mina restaurant in particular is noted for its high quality food and astounding beach-side location. Though various other establishments, long since closed, also line the coastline alongside other historic beachfront properties, giving Tabarja a notoriously sea-worn appearance that many find appealing but is also deceptively decrepit. The bay itself is still, as it has been for millennia, used as a mooring area for both modern boats and traditional Lebanese wooden \\"Haskeh\\" and \\"shakhtoora\\" craft, and rentals are available upon request from any of the local establishments.Saudi Aramco World : Jounieh: Jewel Of Lebanon Tabarja is also unique in that it features the second eldest resort hotel (Superseded by St. Georges Resort of Beirut) from the Lebanese economic boom of the 20th century. The resort is known as King Bargis I, named in honour of King Bargis of local fame, and was built by a local historic figure, Nabih El Azzi, who is responsible for connecting the town to the electric grid and investing generously into the town's infrastructure and standards of living. The namesake of the hotel, King Bargis, is firmly based in local oral history, of which only a few elders maintain and is in danger of cultural loss. Tabarja is also unique due to its uncommon composition of foreign originating Maronite families, such as the House of El Azzi and the House of Nakouzi respectively, and the large number of immigrants which still inhabit the area among local families such as the House of Dargham (which has inhabited the area for millennia). It is also unusual in its large amount of Russian, Romanian and other Slavic inhabitants that arrived as victims of human trafficking during the Civil War, but have since occasionally settled in and become members of the community. Prostitution, however, is still a problem in the nautical town, an issue hearkening back to the age of sail and the French use of Senegalese and other colonial troops during the French Mandate. Tabarja is a historically relevant town of immense cultural value, but has been frequently threatened by modernization and reckless disregard for the local history and architecture, as well as geographic features. Centuries old limestone churches and manor homes of once powerful landed gentry families upon the seaside and limestone formations stand beside contemporary construction that dates only to the latter part of the Civil War, all of which has fallen to decrepitude. Cobblestone and dirt streets have been replaced with crackling tarmac, and new construction continues to threaten the town's rich history as many pursue economic opportunity and misguided modernization. No conservation efforts have to date been put in effect, and the town is considered by many to be an example of unregulated modernization destroying historic sites and culture. Tabarja was also one of the last towns in Lebanon to host a public execution, prompting the de facto abstinence from the death penalty. Tabarja was also, unlike many isolated villages, struck hard by the Lebanese Civil War.

At the left-hand side, one abutment with remnants of the sharply rising arch vault is visible. The Trezzo sull'Adda Bridge or Trezzo Bridge was a medieval bridge at Trezzo sull'Adda in Lombardy, Italy, spanning the Adda river. Completed in 1377, the single-arch bridge held the record for the largest span for over four hundred years, until the beginnings of the Industrial Age,Hans Straub et al.

Crivelli (1886), table 1 History The Trezzo Bridge was built between 1370 and 1377 by order of the lord of Milan Bernab√≤ Visconti. Fortified with towers, it provided access to a Visconti castle high above the Adda. During a siege in 1416, the condottiero Carmagnola deliberately caused the structure to collapse by weakening one of its abutments. Its single arch featured a span of 72 m,Leonardo Fern√°ndez Troyano (2003), p.116 according to other sources even as much as 76 m.Colin O‚ÄôConnor (1993), p.188 By comparison, the second largest pre-industrial bridge vault, the French Pont de Vieille- Brioude, spans 45 m. The rise of the segmental arch was ca. 21 m, with a span- to-rise ratio of 3.3:1. The arch rip, measured at the springing, was 2.25 m thick, corresponding to a favourable ratio of rib thickness to clear span of only 1/32. The sandstone bridge was almost 9 m wide. Today, the two abutments with overhanging remnants of the arch vault are all that remain. The Trezzo Bridge was not matched until the metal Wearmouth Bridge of the same span was built at Sunderland, England, in 1796.Leonardo Fern√°ndez Troyano (2003), p.49 Longer masonry arch spans were not achieved until the 1903 Adolphe Bridge in Luxembourg. __NOTOC__  See also  * Pont del Diable (37.3 m span) * Ponte della Maddalena (37.8 m span) * Puente de San Mart√≠n (Toledo) (40 m span) * Nyons Bridge (40.53 m span) * Pont du Diable (C√©ret) (45.45 m span) * Castelvecchio Bridge (48.7 m span) * Pont Grand (Tournon-sur-Rh√¥ne) (49.2 m span) * Pont de Vieille-Brioude (54 m span) * Dyavolski most (56m span)  References  Sources  *Ariberto Crivelli: Gli avanzi del castello di Trezzo - L'antico ed il nuovo ponte sull'Adda, Milano, 1886 *Colin O‚ÄôConnor: Roman Bridges, Cambridge University Press, 1993, *Donald Hill: A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times, Routledge, 1984, *Ervan G.

United Learning is the trading name for United Church Schools Trust (UCST) and United Learning Trust (ULT). It is one of the largest 10 charities with the most employees in the UK, with central offices in Peterborough, London and Salford. It is governed by a board of trustees and run by an executive team. In 2012, ULT and UCST rebranded to operate under one name, United Learning. They legally remain as two separate charities.  History  United Church Schools Trust began life as the Church Schools Company, formed in 1883 by a committee including the Archbishop of Canterbury. The company was formed in response to the lack of academic education available for girls. The first school the Company opened was Surbiton High School in 1884. By 1885, the Company had 10 schools with 653 pupils between them. United Learning Trust was formed in 2002 as a subsidiary of the United Church Schools Trust (which comprised independent schools only) in response to the government's invitation to develop new state academies. United Learning Trust's first academy, Manchester Academy, opened in 2003, replacing Ducie High School, a school with a severe truancy problem; the academy received an \\"outstanding\\" report from Ofsted in 2009. In 2016 the OFSTED Full inspection: Requires Improvement.'Worst' school praised by Ofsted, BBC News, 28 April 2009. Inspectors noted: \\"No matter what their background, all groups of students make outstanding progress as they move through the years.\\" In 2012, it was agreed that United Church Schools Trust and United Learning Trust should come together under the same branding, 'United Learning', bringing together the state and independent schools represented by the two related charities. United Learning Trust There were 72 United Learning state- funded schools in November 2019. They are free to attend, and accept students of all backgrounds, all faiths and none. The ethos is distinctly Christian and particularly Church of England.

Five twin-locomotive sets were in service from 1925 to 1967.  History  The Swedish part of the ore line, the Iron Ore Line, was electrified in 1915 but Norway kept using steam locomotives until the Norwegian electrification in 1923. As Norwegian traction the El 3 was chosen along with five triple-engine El 4 units. Eight El 3 were built with delivery on August 9, 1925, two more on October 19, 1929. The El 3 and El 4 had about the same characteristics and used for the same purpose and ordered simultaneously; choosing two models like this is atypical for railway companies because of higher maintenance costs. By 1922 SJ had placed an order on the new Of-locomotives, yet NSB chose to base the El 3 on the older Oe. Build by ASEA, they were equipped with quill drive and regenerative braking; the latter only caused problems though, excessively increasing the current that caused damage. They only served on the Norwegian lines until 1949, after which they were where put into through trains to Kiruna. In 1950 LKAB decided to increase the mine output, requiring trains now to haul . In 1953-54 the locomotives were rebuilt to three triple-engine sets and supplemented with eight El 12. When LKAB chose to increase train weights more in the late 1960s, NSB responded with the order of the El 15. All El 3 and El 4 units were taken out of service with the delivery in 1967, none being preserved.

Operation V150, where 150 refers to a target speed in metres per second, was a series of high-speed trials carried out on the LGV Est. The V150 was a specially configured TGV high-speed train (weighing only 265 metric tons) notable for breaking the world railway speed record on 3 April 2007. The train was built in France and reached a speed of on an unopened section of the LGV Est between Strasbourg and Paris, in France topping the previous record of 515.3 kilometres per hour (320.2 mph) set in 1990.  Record of 2007  Operation V150 trials were carried out on the LGV Est prior to its June 2007 opening. The trials were conducted jointly by SNCF, TGV builder Alstom, and LGV Est owner R√©seau Ferr√© de France between 15 January 2007 and 15 April 2007. Following a series of increasingly high-speed runs, the official speed record attempt took place on 3 April 2007. The top speed of , ) was reached at kilometer point 191 near the village of Le Chemin, between the Meuse and Champagne-Ardenne TGV stations, where the most favorable profile exists. Part of the record-breaking V150 unit being sailed in triumph down the Seine for display at the foot of the Eiffel Tower The 515.3 km/h speed record of 1990 was unofficially broken multiple times during the test campaign that preceded and followed the certified record attempt, the first time on 13 February 2007 with a speed of 554.3 kilometres per hour, and the last time on 15 April 2007 with a speed of 574.8 kilometres per hour. V150 record train The train used for the speed record was code named V150, and comprised three modified Duplex cars, fitted with two powered bogies similar to the AGV prototype, marshalled between a pair of TGV power cars from POS trainset 4402. The train had four more powered axles than trainset 325 used in the 1990 speed record, and had a maximum power output of instead of the on a standard TGV POS. This unusual composition was used to obtain high speed test data on disparate technical elements including the new asynchronous traction motors on the POS power cars, the lightweight synchronous permanent magnet traction motors on the AGV bogies, the actively controlled pantograph, and the Duplex bi-level configuration which had never been used in very high speed trials. Aerodynamic improvements, similar to the 1990 record train, were refined in a wind tunnel and provided a 15% reduction in drag from the standard configuration. These improvements included a front air dam, roof fairings over the pantograph openings, membranes to cover the space between the cars, and a flush-mounted windshield. Over 600 sensors were fitted on various parts of both the engines and the cars. The train set ran with larger wheels with a diameter of 1092 mm instead of 920 mm, to limit the rotational speed of the powertrain. Part of TGV trainset 4402 displayed near the Eiffel Tower after the record Test track The record runs took place on a section of track 1 on the LGV Est, usually heading west, between kilometer posts 264 (town of Pr√©ny) and 120 (near the Champagne-Ardenne TGV station). This section of the LGV was chosen for its vertical profile and gentle curves, with favorable downhill segments leading to the highest speeds between kilometer posts 195 and 191, near the border between the Meuse and Marne departments. The track superelevation was increased to support higher speeds. Catenary voltage was increased to 31 kV from the standard 25 kV. The mechanical tension in the wire was increased to 40 kN from the standard 25 kN. The speed of the transverse wave induced in the overhead wire by the train's pantograph was thus increased to , providing a margin of safety beyond the train's maximum speed. Several measurement stations were installed along the test tracks to monitor stresses in the track and ballast, noise, aerodynamic effects, and catenary dynamics. Between kilometer posts 223 and 167, where speeds exceeded , the track was under close surveillance. Record runs Between 15 January 2007 and 15 April 2007, the V150 train traveled at 500 kilometres per hour and above for a cumulative distance of . For each high speed run, another TGV performed a sweep of the track before the V150 train was cleared to start. This sweep was performed at a sustained 380 km/h‚Äîthe peak speed reached in the record of 1981 by TGV POS trainset 4404 in a standard eight-car configuration. The acceleration of the V150 train took place over a distance of 70 kilometres. During certain runs, including the official record run, the V150 train was chased by an A√©rospatiale Corvette airplane to provide data relay and uplink of live television images.

It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1994. It is a member of the genus Chrysomma of the family Paradoxornithidae. The common name commemorates the surgeon-naturalist Thomas C. Jerdon. Description 1876 illustration of Jerdon's babbler Jerdon's babbler in its habitat Measuring 16‚Äì17 cm in length, it is quite intermediate in habitus between certain typical warblers (Sylvia) and the parrotbills (Paradoxornis). Like these, it is a drab bird with a long tail used to balance when creeping through the vegetation; its bill is thicker than in Sylvia but not as heavy as in Paradoxornis. Buffy chestnut brown above and a slightly lighter yellowish-brown on the belly, its lores are pale greyish, as are the throat and breast. The tail and a wing patch are redder than the rest of the upperside. The legs and feet are dark, the bill is greyish-horn colored above and pale below; the eyes' irides are yellowish-brown and a thin nude ring of greenish-yellow skin surrounds the eye. The sexes are alike; young birds have a more orange hue to the upperside plumage, and the lower bill is pink. Differences between subspecies are slight, with the central population essentially have richer chestnut brown and darker grey colours. Its relative, the yellow-eyed babbler (C. sinense), looks like a brighter version of the same but has somewhat more vivid colors, with white replacing grey in the plumage, an additional white supercilium, yellowish legs, feet and irides, and an orange-yellow eye-ring. Taxonomy Chrysomma altirostre was the scientific name proposed by Thomas C. Jerdon in 1862 for a pale reddish brown babbler collected near Thayetmyo in northern Myanmar. Pyctorhis griseigularis proposed by Allan Octavian Hume in 1877 was a ferruginous red babbler collected in the Dooars of Bhutan. Pyctorhis altirostris scindicus proposed by Herbert Hastings Harington in 1915 was an earthy brown babbler from Sukkur in Sindh, Pakistan. Three subspecies are recognized, based mainly on their allopatric ranges: *C. a. altirostre occurs in the floodplains of the Ayeyarwady River from Bhamo to Bago and up the Sittaung River nearly to Taungoo in Myanmar *C. a. griseigularis occurs in the Terai from western Nepal to northeastern India *C. a. scindicum occurs in the Indus River basin  Distribution and habitat  Jerdon's babbler lives all-year-round near river courses, where it inhabits dense reedbeds and tall grasslands consisting of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), common reed (Phragmites) and reedmace (Typha) species. In Pakistan, it occurs along the Indus and its tributaries. In Punjab, India, it was recorded in Harike Wildlife Sanctuary. In the Terai, it was recorded in Shuklaphanta National Park and Dudhwa National Park. In northeast India, it was sighted in Kaziranga, Orang, Manas and Dibru-Saikhowa National Parks, Majuli, and D'Ering Memorial Wildlife Sanctuary. In Myanmar, it was thought to be extinct, but rediscovered in May 2014 in the lower Ayeyarwady floodplain near Yangon. Plants dominating its favorite habitat are typically tall reeds several meters in height. In the Indus River basin, it is associated with hardy sugarcane (Saccharum arundinaceum) and kans grass (S. spontaneum). In the dooars, it also lives in stands of ravennagrass (S. ravennae). On the other hand, sugarcane plantings or other single-species reedbeds as well as lower growth are not very attractive to the species. Other plants, typically grasses, are found to a lesser extent in the bird's haunts, includinge satintails, giant cane (Arundo donax), vetiver or khus (Chrysopogon zizanioides), Desmostachya bipinnata and Themeda arundinacea. Behaviour and ecology Its song is a weak 4- to 8-note warbling chi-chi-chi-chew-chew-chew, tew-tew-tew-tew chew or ih-ih-ih-ih chew chitit chew i'wwiuu, with a drawn-out end note and sometimes starting with a chatter of itch, itit or tchew. Birds sing usually in the early morning and in the evening, perching upright on a reed, with the head slightly elevated. Calls include a short tic or tsik, sometimes extended into a series ts-ts-tsik which may end in a plaintive tew. Pairs or families, occasionally small flocks of 1-2 dozen, move about quietly in dense stands of grasses and reeds that grow several meters high, usually avoiding lower growth and shrubland. A typical foraging technique involves perching nearly horizontally on a reed stem, picking up a leaf sheath with the bill, and quickly tearing off the leaf and its base sheet to expose small arthropods and other invertebrates. The tearing of dry leaves produces a subdued crackling sound that can sometimes be heard from some dozens of meters away. Conservation status Jerdon's babbler is nowhere common and thought to be declining. Its continuing existence in Bangladesh is uncertain. The subspecies scindicum is known to be rare and has been declining throughout recent decades. Altogether, less than 10,000 adult birds are thought to remain. This means that its population has declined by an estimated 30% and is expected to continue to do so for another decade at least. The reasons are not fully understood, but the population reduction is probably related to habitat destruction by drainage and damming of wetlands for agriculture and flood control, and these threats are not expected to cease anytime soon. Presently, such habitat is extremely rare. Sustainable cutting of reedbeds, which yield material for human use, is apparently tolerated by C. altirostre. In Pakistan, it is often sighted in the Rohri Canal south of Khairpur. Large flocks are found in partially cut or burned reedbeds, thus if large-scale clear-cutting is avoided, human use of reeds may in fact improve habitat quality by preventing the simultaneous aging and decay of wide stretches of habitat. As a rule-of-thumb, as long as a healthy population of Phragmites reeds persists, the birds are likely to persist too.

He first appeared on 9 January 2007 as a new student. In July 2010, it was announced that Davies would be leaving the show. He made his final appearance on 15 November 2010. During his time on the show, Elliot was involved in storylines including a relationship with his friend Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and finding his long-lost father. Character creation Elliot was created in 2006 and on the day auditions were held and Davies had attended other castings. Of his Hollyoaks audition Davies stated: \\"The day I went for the audition I also had a casting for a McVities biscuits ad, I‚Äôm glad I got the one I did, but it was a weird audition. I remember thinking how many other boys there were on the day and how attractive they all were. I just thought they want good-looking guys like them, not me.\\" (Carley Stenson) who plays Steph Cunningham in the serial, put in a good word to producers, helping him secure the role. Davies has revealed that he had to escalate his Welsh accent to impress producers, stating: ‚ÄúThey also really liked the Welsh thing ‚Äì they went mad for it. They thought it just added to his geeky character,‚Äù he said, with a less pronounced Welsh accent than Elliot‚Äôs. I had to ham up my Welshness to fit in with the odd perception of Wales the producers had.\\" In 2010, it was announced Davies had quit Hollyoaks and would depart later in the year. His departure was confirmed at the same time as Glen Wallace, who portrays Malachy Fisher, and John Pickard (Dom Reilly)'s departures. Speaking of his decision to leave, Davies commented, \\"It's very strange to think that after four years I'll be leaving this place. It's been such a great experience and I've loved every minute ‚Äî everybody says it but Hollyoaks really is a great place to work. I've made some amazing friends in the cast and crew and I'll miss them all. I'm not sure that I'll miss Elliot's geeky glasses and that damn woolly hat but I will miss Elliot ‚Äî he's been a fantastic character to play and I will look back on this experience with very fond memories\\". A spokesperson for Channel 4 also commented on the exits, stating: \\"We're all sad to be losing yet more friends from the cast but everyone acknowledges that actors want to move on to pursue other roles. Nothing's been firmed up yet storyline-wise but one thing's for sure, they'll all be memorable exits.\\" Reflecting on his decision to leave, Davies said, \\"I think my character had done everything he was going to do on the show and as an actor it felt like a good time to move on. It's exciting to be back out there and auditioning for things again.\\" Storylines=Backstory Elliot first appears as a very intelligent student, who is interested in aliens and paranormal studies. His interest in aliens stems back to when he was a child, when his father Gareth Bevan (Phil Howe) bought Elliot telescopes in order to look into space. Gareth had another son called Maynard, due to an affair, so walked out on Elliot and wife Bonnie (Melanie Walters). In order to protect Elliot's feelings, Bonnie raised Elliot to believe Gareth was abducted by aliens. 2007‚Äì2010 Elliot arrives in January 2007 as a radio caller who calls Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) to tell him about his views on UFOs. Kris is sceptical, so Elliot meets with Kris and shows him recordings of alien sightings. Kris still refuses to believe him. However, Kris's flatmate Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall) publishes Elliot's theories in the college newspaper. Elliot develops feelings for Jessica and on numerous occasions tries to persuade her to go out with him. Elliot tries to stand up for Steph when she is taunted by Wayne Tunnicliffe (Joe Marsden) and Sonny Valentine (Devon Anderson). Steph tells Elliot she does not need help. When Wayne throws eggs at Elliot, Steph intervenes and helps him. After this, Elliot and Steph become friends, and Elliot takes her stargazing. Steph begins to assume Elliot has a crush on her, however he tells her he does not. Jess finds Elliot's diary in the village and publishes some of its content to the college newspaper. An angry and embarrassed Elliot attempts to buy all of the newspapers. With help from fellow student Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley), Elliot retrieves his diary from Jess. Elliot learns his mother Bonnie (Melanie Walters) has arranged a marriage for him back in Wales to a girl named Rhiannon. Steph agrees to help Elliot, by pretending to be his girlfriend, so he does not need to get married. However, Bonnie appears in the village and tells Elliot she still expects him to marry Rhiannon. Elliot then stands up to his mother, who leaves the village. Elliot becomes friends with John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) when they take over Kris's radio station after an argument. Elliot begins to feel that the radio broadcasts are the only time anyone ever listens to him, so they agree not to tell Kris that they were the ones who took over the station. After this, Elliot falls for close friend Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley). During a date, Elliot is angered to discover it was a publicity stunt, due to Sarah's modelling career, and is upset when a reporter taunts him about his looks. Sarah, who does not acknowledge Elliot's feelings, begins an affair with Elliot's physics lecturer Roger Kiddle (Quentin Tibble). After Elliot discovers finds Sarah and Roger in bed together, he is angry, and refuses to speak to either of them. Still upset over Sarah, Elliot refuses to help Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson) and Barry \\"Newt\\" Newton (Nico Mirallegro) with their studies. Lauren and Newt decide to take revenge on Elliot by pretending to be Elliot's father, who Elliot believes was abducted by aliens. They lead Elliot out into the woods at night, where he believes his father is coming to meet him. Elliot begins calling for his father when he does not show. Elliot goes missing, only to turn up in hospital a few days later, suffering from hypothermia. Bonnie arrives to visit him and confesses that Elliot's father walked out on them when Elliot was a child, and was not abducted. Feeling betrayed, Elliot rids himself of all his astronomical belongings and changes his image. With this, he becomes a stronger person and stands up against Newt, Lauren, Sarah and Roger. Soon after, Elliot sees that he is not happy with his new style, so changes back and makes up with Sarah. Weeks later, Elliot is convinced by Zak, among others, to tell Sarah how he feels about her, which he does. Initially Sarah is not interested. However, she eventually realises that she really does like Elliot and agrees to go out with him. After going on several dates, Sarah begins to put pressure on Elliot to have sex. Elliot then decides that they have little in common, so ends their relationship. Elliot then becomes close to Sarah's friend Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby), and begins to have feelings for her. Hannah also develops feelings for Elliot, and they begin a relationship, much to Sarah's jealousy when she catches them in bed together. However, Elliot and Hannah's relationship is also short lived, as he seems more interested in spending time with her father Nev (Jim Millea), building model rockets. Elliot's fellow student Leila Roy (Lena Kaur) shows an interest in him and they soon begin a relationship. Leila contacts Elliot's father Gareth (Phil Howe). Elliot is reluctant to talk to his father, and is angered with Leila for interfering. After agreeing to hear Gareth's reasons for leaving him and his mother, Elliot is shocked when Gareth tells him he has another son named Maynard, Elliot's half brother. Leila grows suspicious of Gareth and calls Bonnie, who reveals Gareth had an affair, this being the reason he left her and Elliot. Elliot tells Gareth to leave, and ends his relationship with Leila. Elliot, Kris, Zak and Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard) move into a flat together, where they find ¬£100,000 belonging to Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). They all agree to split the money. However, Archie calls his friend Ged Paxton (Charlie Wade) to pretend to kidnap him, claiming to be an old acquaintance of Warren's looking for the money. Elliot, Kris and Zak agree to give Ged the money, unaware it is a stitch up. Ged, however, decides he wants all of the money, and threatens to throw Archie from a roof. When Kris, Zak and Elliot discover Archie's lies, Kris throws the money over the roof and it blows away in the wind. Elliot is further betrayed by Archie when he sleeps with Leila. Elliot, Kris, Zak and Zoe Carpenter (Zoe Lister) begin a job in a call centre, where they work for Sheila Buxton (Jessica Hall). Sheila takes a liking to Elliot and they eventually start a short-lived relationship, which is ended when Elliot realises he loves Leila. Leila, however, moves to Paris to become an artist. Elliot befriends new student Kevin Smith (Cameron Crighton), who claims to be an alien from a different planet. Elliot agrees to help him build a beacon in order to summon his race. Elliot finds Kevin's birth certificate and discovers he was abandoned by his parents at birth. Kevin later goes missing and Elliot discovers a new planet in the Solar System. He receives a job offer from NASA. Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse- Spendlove) is sceptical of the e-mail and tells Elliot not to trust it. However, NASA send Elliot a plane ticket to America. Realising he may never see Kevin again, Elliot hangs up his beloved hat on the beacon and leaves for his new job.

Llantwit Fardre is also the name of the old parish and the community area that takes in the villages of Llantwit Fardre, Tonteg and Church Village. It is in the county of Rhondda Cynon Taf. The Welsh Government has constructed a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473 road at Tonteg, Church Village and Llantwit Fardre. The Church Village bypass, as it is known, has been built as a single carriageway, with crawler and overtaking lanes around roundabouts, and was opened for traffic in September 2010. Etymology It is believed the name Llantwit Fardre is derived from an old Welsh Language name meaning The Church of St Illtud (Llantwit), on the Home Farm of the Prince (Faerdref) and relates to the land surrendered to the prince of the District by his subject to provide him with an income. Saint Illtud was a 5th-century Celtic priest who built his second church roughly in the area where the present church stands. He was later famed as the Saint of the Five Keys of youth, learning, chivalry, priesthood and knighthood.

Just So was originally produced by Cameron Mackintosh at the Watermill Theatre and in 1990, also by Mackintosh, at the Tricycle Theatre in London. It has been subsequently produced at various theatres in the US and UK. Synopsis Act One The Eldest Magician begins by reading a story ‚Äúbefore the High and Far-Off Times‚Äù to the Best Beloved. As he does so, various indistinguishable animals appear on stage. The Eldest Magician, who created them, was very pleased...until he realized that they all looked the same. He bid the animals to go forth and find out what they were. (Just So) All of the animals did as the Eldest Magician asked except for Pau Amma the Crab, who vowed to be disobedient and play alone in the waters. He grew and grew and grew, and would go out looking for food twice a day, causing large areas of the land to flood, and so disrupting many of the other animals. (Another Tempest) One day when the elephants have gathered round the watering hole, they discuss the tyranny of the Crab. Bursting into the interior of the circle, the Elephant's Child decides (There's No Harm In Asking), and so to the elephants' annoyance he asks a continuous series of questions, all of which they dismiss as ‚Äúsilly‚Äù (Silly Questions). They are interrupted however by the Crab's feed and are forced to move to higher ground. The Elephant's Child decides to find Pau Amma and make him stop. He finds the Eldest Magician who encourages the flightless Kolokolo Bird to join the Elephant's Child on a journey to the Limpopo River in search of the Crab. (Limpopo River) Travelling in a small raft, the two travellers are thrown off course by a storm created by the Crab and are washed up on an uninhabited island where the Parsee Man and his beloved Cooking Stove can no longer cook after the Crab constantly floods the crops they grow (Living On This Island). The Elephant's Child and the Kolokolo Bird ask the Parsee Man if they may stay and try one of his cakes.. As they chat, Rhinoceros bursts on stage complaining about his thick skin which appears painfully tight (Thick Skin). He then continues on his way. Parsee Man and the cooking stove agree to cook a special cookie made out of the emergency rations as a gift. Along with the various Cake Ingredients (Butter, Sugar and Flour) Parsee Man shows the Elephant's Child and the Kolokolo Bird how to limber up (The Parsee Cake Walk). Rhino, who smells cake, comes back and tries to blend in amongst the dancing ingredients. Once the cake is completed he leaps forward and greedily rushes off with it, leaving the Parsee Man and the cooking stove vowing to get revenge (The Crime). The Elephant's Child and the Kolokolo Bird set sail once again. The raft finally reaches the coast of Africa where they meet the animals on the High Veldt. Giraffe and Zebra lounge around chatting, whilst Leopard and Jaguar are slowly moving in, hungry for a catch (The Chase). The Jaguar and the Leopard realise that the Elephant's child and the Kolokolo Bird are around and go about surprising them in hope that they will make a good meal. When the Elephant's Child asks for help in finding the Crab, they offer a deal: they will help find the Limpopo River in exchange for help finding Giraffe and Zebra. When the Elephant's Child asks why, Jaguar and Leopard cheerfully explain (We Want To Take The Ladies Out). The idea of the cats eating the innocent creatures troubles both of the travelers, who feel they should warn the other animals. He therefore convinces Giraffe and Zebra to join him and the Kolokolo Bird (Pick Up Your Hooves and Trot). The group comes across a jungle where they eventually decide to rest until tomorrow. But the Giraffe and the Zebra stick out, causing concern that the cats may still find them. The Elephant's Child discovers the Jungle light, and prays to the Eldest Magician to help use it to camouflage them. The Eldest Magician molds and shapes the light beam to fall on the animals in such a way as to hide the giraffe and zebra. The two are transformed into their permanently patchy and stripey patterns.(Jungle Light) But their celebration is interrupted by the sound of crashing waves. The baobab tree collapses allowing sunlight into the clearing and causing chaos. It turns out the Crab rose out of the water, blotting out the sun. The Crab asks who dares challenge him. The Elephant's Child speaks up and politely asks the Crab to stop playing with the sea as it causes great havoc for the other animals. Pau Amma laughs and vows to go out and hunt for food seven times a day now so that the waters will never be still. The Elephant's Child is now scared and doesn't know what to do at all. The Kolokolo Bird steps forward and convinces him that they must continue their way to the Limpopo River and promises they will think of something to stop the Crab. (Limpopo River (Reprise)) Act Two The Eldest Magician is interrupted by the arrival of the Elephant's Child and the Kolokolo Bird having an argument (The Argument). It appears that they are lost and the two continue to blame each other until the Elephant's Child runs off, having called the Kolokolo Bird a freak for being scared of flying. The Elephant's Child immediately accuses the Eldest Magician of being at fault. The Eldest Magician counsels him that the very thing he is looking for might be right under his nose. The Eldest Magician introduces The Elephant's Child to the Kangaroo, who sings about how normal his legs used to be (Aboriginally I). He wanted, however, to be more powerful and so the Eldest Magician recruited the Dingo Dog to chase him, building up the muscles in the Kangaroo's legs (Leaps and Bounds). As he ran he began to hop, and as his legs got larger he hopped so much that he could run no more. As Kangaroo exits he warns the Elephant's Child, ‚ÄúSometimes you get what you want, sometimes you get what you deserve.‚Äù The now sheepish Elephant's Child goes off in search of the Kolokolo Bird. Back in the jungle, the Kolokolo Bird sits wondering why she always makes herself wait (Wait A Bit). However, the two cats appear and tie her up, just as the Elephant's Child bursts through to rescue her. The Jaguar offers to let the bird go in exchange for the whereabouts of the Zebra and the Giraffe. Giraffe and Zebra taunt and tease them. The cats can only hear and smell their prey, since Giraffe and Zebra are perfectly camouflaged by their new skins. The Elephant's Child offers to show the Leopard and the Jaguar how they can change their skins too in exchange for his and the Kolokolo Bird's freedom. The cats agree, and use smoke (Just So (Reprise)) to acquire new unique and camouflaged hides of their own. The Elephant's Child is searching for a now hidden Kolokolo Bird in order to apologize (Does The Moment Ever Come). The Parsee Man and the Cooking Stove enter in a boat made from an upturned Crab shell with the Rhino swimming close behind. An already frustrated Elephant's Child tells the group to stop acting like children and make friends. The Rhino blames the Parsee Man for ruining his skin, as he filled it with crumbs whilst the Rhino was swimming. He prepares to charge at the Parsee Man's Cooking Stove, but the Parsee Man begs the Rhino (Please Don't Touch My Stove). Rhino, Parsee Man, and the Cooking Stove all agree to be friends. The Elephant's Child sees water in the distance and exclaims they must be at the Limpopo River. But the head of a Crocodile invites him to come over, offering to give the Elephant's Child directions if he will give him a meal (Little One Come Hither). When the Elephant's Child gets closer the Crocodile grabs him and tries to eat him. The Kolokolo Bird appears on a branch and, though scared, flies/falls to the ground to save the Elephant's Child. Eventually the Elephant's Child pulls free and the Crocodile slinks back into the water. The Elephant's Child is embarrassed to see that his nose has been pulled into a trunk. The Kolokolo Bird encourages him to look on the bright side of having such a long nose and the Elephant's Child apologizes for being so rude. The Elephant's Child suddenly notices the abandoned Crab shell. When the Kolokolo Bird mentions it is an old Crab shell that has been shed, the Elephant's Child realizes how they can defeat the Crab. The Eldest Magician appears and narrates while the Elephant's Child and the Kolokolo Bird put their plan into action (If). The Elephant's Child finds Pau Amma and challenges him. As the Crab emerges from the water the Elephant's Child signals to the Eldest Magician, who casts a spell on the Crab which makes him finally shrink. When the Eldest Magician asks the other animals what to do with the Crab, the Elephant's Child prompts him to let the Crab go to play in the sea, where he can no longer harm anyone. All of the animals and the Eldest Magician celebrate their victories and their uniqueness with a grand finale.

Development Shortly after the German attack in 1941, Soviet headquarters realized a need for transport gliders and ordered the development of several designs. The biggest was a design of Dmitry Kolesnikov and Pavel Tsibin, although it was still a light glider. Two prototypes were built in October 1941. It was ordered for production, under the designation KC-20 (or KTs-20) for designers' initials and the number of troopes carried. 68 were built in 1942-1943. They were produced in a wood industry works in Lopatino village near Kazan. The KC-20 was the biggest, but least numerous of Soviet transport gliders. It could transport 20 troops or up to 2200 kg of cargo. It was quite successful, its major drawback was a lack of a big cargo hatch, therefore guns could by only carried in parts. It was initially planned to fit the glider with a back machine gun turret, hence double tailfin, but the plan was abandoned. Operational history Like Antonov A-7 and Gribovski G-11, they were mainly used for supplying Soviet partisans with provisions, weapons, equipment and trained men, in night flights. The most intensive use was from April to November 1943 in Belarus, in the Polotsk-Begoml-Lepel area. After landing, gliders were destroyed and pilots were sometimes taken back by aircraft. They were also used to transport sabotage groups behind enemy lines. KC-20s were towed mainly by DB-3 bombers. A less typical action was an air bridge from Moscow to the Stalingrad area in November 1942, in order to quickly deliver antifreeze cooling liquid for tanks, during the battle of Stalingrad.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 26 September 2006 and was introduced by series producer Bryan Kirkwood as part of the McQueen family. Cooper has stated that whilst Lucy Allan produced the serial she was not used and Jacqui had \\"lost her identity\\". In 2010 when Paul Marquess took over the role, he recognised she was an under used character split her apart from the McQueen family, subsequently increasing her role within the show. Jacqui has been portrayed as a \\"tough ex-con\\" and is extremely feisty, she often takes on the matriarch role within the McQueens. Many of Jacqui's early storylines revolved around her life of crime, marrying Aleksander Malota (Jon Lolis) to pay off debts and her wayward relationship with Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), which became popular with viewers. One of her most prominent early plots involved her desire to have her own child after a miscarriage left her unable to, this resulted in failed adoption, various surrogate mother stories involving her family and eventually led to the breakdown of her relationship with Tony. Jacqui's later storylines involved her relationship with Des Townsend (Kris Deedigan), covering up Calvin Valentine's (Ricky Whittle) murder, being blackmailed and held at knife point for sex and a \\"surprise relationship\\" with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) which also become very popular with audiences. In 2011 Jacqui made a rape accusation against Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), whether Gilly is guilty or innocent was decided by a jury composed of viewers. The storyline subsequently resulted in Gilly being found not guilty. Various critics have praised the character because of her \\"feisty and tough persona\\". Others have criticised her \\"chav\\" dress sense and accused her of being a \\"trollop\\". Cooper has received various award nominations for her portrayal. It was later announced that Cooper had quit Hollyoaks and Jacqui departed Hollyoaks on 26 April 2013. Her character currently lives in Spain. Casting In May 2010, Cooper felt that she had been sidelined by former producer Lucy Allan and that Jacqui had lost her identity. New executive producer Paul Marquess also felt that Cooper had been under used. He decided to split Jacqui away from the rest of the McQueens, his reason for which being that there was so much \\"talent\\" in terms of acting within the family, he felt Cooper or Jacqui didn't need that \\"support system\\". He increased her role in storylines. This made Cooper delighted, of the changes she stated: \\"he seemed to like what I did and he's worked on it and developed it. Paul has really taken me under his wing, he's worked me so hard and he's given me opportunities that I could only have dreamt of.\\" Speaking of her approach to playing Jacqui, Cooper has said: \\"I try to tame Claire back because I'm a really emotional, sensitive person and very different from Jacqui, so I do work hard and I feel very privileged.\\" Character development=Characterisation Jacqui has been described as tough and hard. Holy Soap refer to her as a \\"tough ex-con\\". Jacqui often takes on the matriarch role. Jacqui deals with the sisters in a different way and can get different responses from the sisters. Cooper describes her as always being there to pick up the pieces for her family. She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: \\"I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm to her again. But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting and I try to give them as much as I can.\\" Jacqui has never had an affair in the serial, of her morality Cooper states: \\"It's all about family for Jacqui and she's never cheated on any of her sisters. She's got morals and this isn't good enough.\\" Cooper has also spoke of her confusion of the audiences perception that Jacqui is \\"a bitch\\" when she has strong morals. Cooper has said she is proud of Jacqui's wardrobe because it is not glam. She brands her as the complete opposite of the \\"honey image\\" the serial sometimes becomes associated with. Describing how she plays Jacqui she states: \\"It's great playing Jacqui because I can just be completely grotesque and over the top, snarling and grunting.\\" BBC America describe Jacqui as being the toughest of the McQueen sisters and comment on her thieving ways stating: \\"She began the McQueens' shoplifting tradition, teaching her younger siblings how to steal while their mother was at work and basically putting stolen goods in Michaela's hands from birth.\\" Relationship with Tony Hutchinson Jacqui's relationship with Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) was often strained by her desire for children. Her sister Tina McQueen (Leah Hackett) agrees to be a surrogate mother for her child. The storyline was included to help house many lies and secrets that had previously been built up prior, including Tony's affair with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) and Tina's affair with Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), of which Kirkwood stated there was \\"there's so much ammunition in store\\", which would eventually devastate Jacqui. Kirkwood also devised the plot to show of Coopers skills in playing tragedy, of this he commented: \\"It'll also give Claire Cooper and Nick Pickard another opportunity to show off their acting talents. Tony and Jacqui are one of those couples that we can have fun with - but also will blow the audience away when dealing with tragedy.\\" In a later storyline Tony announces his intentions to marry Cindy Hutchinson (Stephanie Waring), prompting Jacqui to try to talk Tony out of it. Cooper has stated that she believes that her character is meant to be with Tony because \\"he is the love of Jacqui's life\\" and that hearing their engagement makes Jacqui feel like she \\"has a knife in her back.\\" Cooper also hopes one day that the pair will reunite stating: \\"Jacqui needs to move on right now, but ultimately I'd prefer the story to come full circle and lead back to Tony.\\" Cooper also revealed that at the time she was often approached by fans asking her when the couple would reconcile. Pickard has also stated he didn't think Cindy was right for him and that he believed Jacqui to be the love of Tony's life. Relationship with Rhys Ashworth In 2010, Jacqui embarked on a \\"surprise\\" relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: \\"I think Rhys is going to fall in love again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while.\\" The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: \\"When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui.\\" Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: \\"It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible.\\" She also adopted a \\"couple name\\" for the pair titled \\"Ja-Rhys\\". Claire Cooper (pictured) has said that her own rapport with Moss made Jacqui and Rhys' relationship realistic. Jacqui and Rhys were given the biggest storyline in spring 2011 in the serial, of this Marquess stated: \\"They have got the biggest story for the first half of 2011. I think it may be one of the biggest stories in Hollyoaks history. It's very, very serious and I think it will really divide the audience. It will really test them and their relationship to the nth degree, and we'll see whether they can recover from it.\\" King of Hearts In September 2010, it was announced that actor Darren Day had been cast as new character Danny Houston, described as a gangster who would \\"spell trouble for Jacqui\\". Danny takes a shine to Jacqui and they share a couple of dates; during an interview Day brands Danny's attraction to Danny being down to her feisty manner adding: \\"Jacqui stands up to him, and even though he's not used to it, I think he likes it. He's quite intrigued by the fact that she's so feisty and he likes that edginess about her.\\" It was later revealed that a special late night episode had been commissioned which would feature Jacqui. The storyline was described as \\"sinister\\" and would involve Danny and returnee Kathleen McQueen (Alison Burrows), as they rig a game of poker with dramatic consequences. Of her involvement in the episode Cooper stated: \\"I was really chuffed and felt very flattered and privileged to be given the opportunity to do so much.\\" On-screen the storyline involves Kathleen blackmailing the McQueens for money, threatening to reveal their roles in Calvin's murder. Kathleen is described as Jacqui's \\"worst enemy\\", of this Cooper stated: \\"She hates her with a passion - her worst enemy ever has been dragged back! It's funny and comedic at times, but then it can get deadly serious.\\" Although she knows the risks of crossing Danny, she tries to fix the poker game; of this Cooper comments that \\"It's pure desperation\\" on Jacqui's behalf. When Danny exposes her, he threatens her with Rhys' life, stating if she does not sleep with him, he will kill Rhys. In a turn of events Jacqui turns him down. Cooper defends Jacqui's actions stating that she is a \\"bright girl\\" and adding \\"She doesn't want to sleep with him and also she knows he's not going to drop Rhys in front of so many people. So when he says it, she considers her options, weighs them up.\\" Jacqui faces more horror from Danny when she is threatened at knife point to strip for him, scared for her life she complies. Speaking of Jacqui's sudden change of heart, Cooper states: \\"He pulls out a knife. That changes the situation - the dynamic changes immediately. He could do something really horrible to her - it's not necessarily about killing someone, he could slash her face or anything. In a situation like that, your mind plays tricks as you wonder what someone could do to you.\\" Cooper has spoken of her feelings of responsibility to portray it correctly and stated \\"I wanted to show how horrendous it was for Jacqui. She wonders whether she could die like this - all to protect her family‚Ä¶\\" Sexual assault In December 2010, Channel 4 released a press statement which revealed Jacqui and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) would drunkenly cheat on Rhys together, after she finds out Rhys has slept with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) and that the night's events would \\"change their lives forever\\". It was later announced that the storyline would see Jacqui accusing Gilly of raping her. The storyline received much coverage in various tabloid newspapers who also branded it as a \\"shock plot\\" for the serial. None of the cast members involved in the storyline knew if Jacqui had actually been raped, of this Cooper states: 'They're telling the same story but are looking at it from different angles. Just who to believe is a very grey area. It will split the village and the viewers. We don't know what happened that night, We've just been told that our characters each think they're telling the truth. [Anthony] and I have talked about it a lot. I even read his scripts to try to work it out. The outcome will be a surprise for both of us.' The storyline began to play out on-screen in February 2011, describing how it starts to develop and the effects it has on Gilly a spokesperson for the serial told Inside Soap: \\"Jacqui loves Rhys, so she's really hurt when she finds out about his infidelity. Then she runs into Gilly who's also got relationship problems,. The drink starts to flow, and one thing leads to another... Gilly consumed with guilt over sleeping with his best friend's girlfriend, it doesn't help that Jacqui leaves Gilly's place while he's asleep - and runs into Rhys. But after Gilly wakes up, he knows he has to tell his mate what he's done. When Gilly confesses, Rhys is both furious and hurt, and lashes out violently. [...] Once he's confronted Gilly, he demands an explanation from Jacqui - and is stunned when she tells him she was actually raped, it's absolutely devastating.\\" The storyline later takes another turn when Gilly confronts Jacqui in the village with everyone watching, leading everyone to doubt if he did commit the act or not. It was later revealed that the details were left unclear because Lime Pictures had decided to leave the outcome of the rape trial into viewers. Viewers have been given the chance to apply for the fictional jury, consisting of a cross section of society, including non- Hollyoaks viewers. They will be shown evidence from the case and then decide whether Gilly is guilty or innocent. Chief executive of Lime Pictures, Carolyn Reynolds stated: \\"We wanted to open up the thorny issue of how hard it is to be a juror and whether the court room the best place to resolve some of these questions about rape.\\" The storyline was developed with the \\"St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre\\" and other charities. DCI Ben Snuggs, leader of Don't Cross the Line campaign, explaining: \\"This storyline represents an issue that we see all too often, involving whether consent is clear on the part of both parties involved in sexual activity, and particularly when alcohol and drugs are involved.\\" Gilly was found not guilty, leaving Jacqui devastated. Gilly later confessed to the rape, as he recalled that Jacqui had not only not consented, but had removed any perceived consent. Gilly left the village and did not go to the police. Departure On 21 February 2013, it was revealed that Cooper had quit the show and her final scenes would air in April. Cooper said that she had the \\"most incredible and unforgettable\\" time and Jacqui had been a \\"fascinating part to play\\".

The Finger Lakes Council served the Finger Lakes Region of New York. At the time of the merger with the Otetiana Council the council service center was located in Geneva, New York and it was operating Camp Babcock‚ÄìHovey in Ovid, New York. The Otetiana Council served the Greater Rochester area. At the time of the merger with the Finger Lakes Council the council service center was located in Downtown Rochester, New York and it was operating the Massawepie Scout Camps in the Adirondack Park as well as Camp Cutler in Naples, New York. The Seneca Waterways Council Scouting Historical Society has a collection of memorabilia relating to the history of Scouting in the Seneca Waterways Council. Exhibits are displayed at the council service center near the entrance to the Scout shop and are changed bi-monthly. The society meets the third or fourth Tuesday of each month at 7:00 pm, visitors are welcome. Camps Some of the historical camps maintained by Seneca Waterways Council's predecessors included Camp Otetiana (Canandaigua Lake, 1918‚Äì1926); Camp Tarion (Canandaigua Lake, 1925‚Äì1933); Camp Pioneer (Seneca Lake, 1927‚Äì1938); Camp Three Lakes (Lake Ontario/Durand-Eastman Park 1931‚Äì1939); Camp Arrowhead (Sandy Harbor/Hamlin, 1933‚Äì1937); Camp Archibald (Point Breeze/Carlton, 1938‚Äì1942); Camp EONAC (Cranberry Lake/Wanakena, 1938‚Äì1949); Brown Camp (Wolcott, 1938‚Äì?); Camp J.

Camp Babcock-Hovey Camp Babcock-Hovey is the premier Boy Scout camp in the Finger Lakes Region. Camp Babcock-Hovey sits on the east shore of Seneca Lake and spans of woodlands and fields. Babcock-Hovey accommodates every type of camper and meets all ability levels. The camp is fully handicap accessible; because of this it is the site of the annual Rotary Camp Onseyawa summer camp. The camp has a lakeside waterfront, hiking trails and 10 campsites equipped with tent platforms and lean-tos. In 2007 a gravel road was put in from the entrance to the Dining Hall and in 2008 a new Science and Tech Building was built to promote Science and Technology for 14- to 18-year-olds.[2] In 2010 Pooler's Pond was added for Cub Scout fishing and boating. In 2017 an ATV safety program was added, in partnership with Honda and the ATV Safety Institute, for summer and off season use by individual 14 and older. They have a very active alumni association. J. Warren Cutler Scout Reservation The J. Warren Cutler Scout Reservation, also known as Camp Cutler, is a camp located in the heart of the Finger Lakes Region of western New York State. It is named after Joseph Warren Cutler (1857‚Äì1934), a prominent Rochester businessman who ran the Cutler Manufacturing Company with his brother James Goold Cutler (1848‚Äì1927). Joseph Cutler was an avid supporter of Scouting and served as the treasurer of the Rochester Council. After the younger Cutler's death, his widow, Mrs. Amy Jenkins Cutler (1874‚Äì1958), donated their family summer home on Lake Road in Webster, New York, to form part of the original Camp Cutler, which was dedicated in 1939. Chief Scout Executive James E. West was present for the event. In the early 1960s Monroe County purchased the property along with additional acreage that had been obtained by the council and added the property to Webster Park. During the same time, negotiations began with the Keenan family to purchase their lands for a new camp. An agreement was reached and the first portion of the new camp was purchased in January 1962. Five years later, in 1966, a dedication ceremony was held. The new Camp J. Warren Cutler has been in continual operation since that time. Camp Cutler is a year- round facility. The camp offers many camping opportunities for Scouts. Campsites range from primitive to rustic sites with lean-tos, to buildings with wood-burning stoves, winterized buildings, training centers with kitchen equipment that can support large groups, and the theme buildings that house the Cub Scout Adventure Camp. The camp is staffed by professional forest rangers, assisted on week-ends by BSA volunteers known as \\"Camp Masters\\". The Cub Scout Adventure Camp, also known as \\"CSAC,\\" was dedicated in 1993 and operates at Camp Cutler in July and August. Cub Scout Adventure Camp is a three-day, two night Cub Scout summer camp based on five adventure themes: the ships of the High Seas, a fort of the old west, a castle of medieval times, a mountain man encampment and a Native American village. Massawepie Scout Camps thumb Massawepie Scout Camps (the MSC) is a Boy Scout reservation, owned by Seneca Waterways Council, situated around Massawepie Lake in St. Lawrence County of New York. Otetiana Council purchased the Massawepie property in 1951, and opened the first summer camp in 1952. The area is divided into 4 camps: Mountaineer, Pioneer, Forester, and Voyager. only Pioneer is in use as an active campground (With campsites from Voyager incorporated into Pioneer); Camp Mountaineer is in use for ancillary activities. The size of the entire reservation is approximately . The reservation includes all of Massawepie Lake and nine other freshwater ponds (Catamount, Long, Round, Horseshoe, Boot Tree, Deer, Town Line, Pine and Lost). The camp is one of the largest Boy Scout reservations in the Northeastern United States, and attracts visiting Boy Scout troops from throughout the region and the country, including California, and New Jersey. Massawepie means \\"the beaver's lake\\" in Iroquois. Tschipey Achtu Lodge The Order of the Arrow is represented by Tschipey Achtu Lodge. The lodge was formed in 2010 by a merger of Ty-Ohni Lodge, founded in 1936, and Ganeodiyo Lodge, founded in 1949. Tschipey Achtu means Ghost Deer. The Lodge membership voted to use the official name Tschipey Achtu Lodge No. 397, but the ability to use 397 as a lodge number is under some debate, and Tschipey Achtu is operating without a lodge number.

He went on to serve for fifteen years as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Education and wartime career Beazley was educated at Highgate School, and then went up to St John's College, Oxford, where he read philosophy, politics and economics. In 1942, on leaving Oxford during the Second World War, he joined the Rifle Brigade, with whom he served in north Africa, Italy and Austria. He reached the rank of Captain. ICI Demobilised in 1947, Beazley joined Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) as a manager. In his early career with the company he was often stationed abroad: in Germany for seven years, and also in Portugal, Belgium and South Africa. He was promoted to be a General Manager, a divisional board director and eventually Vice Chairman of the company. He was also a Managing Director of some of ICI's associated companies. Beazley learned to speak four foreign languages well, owing to his foreign travels. He was a Research Fellow of the Royal Institution of International Affairs in 1977‚Äì78. Conservative politics Beazley retired from ICI in 1978, having been selected as Conservative Party candidate in Bedfordshire for the 1979 European Parliament election. This constituency was considered a marginal before the election, for it included Labour-voting towns such as Luton and Bedford as well as Hemel Hempstead. However, with the help of a collapse in the Labour vote in the wake of that party's loss of the May 1979 general election, Beazley won with a majority of 53,600. Member of the European Parliament Beazley concentrated on the European Community's impact on business, trying to provide business with information on legislation and regulations being proposed in Brussels. In January 1981, he opposed a call for the Ireland national rugby union team to cancel a tour of apartheid South Africa, justifying his stance on the grounds that multiracial rugby was practised throughout South Africa. He was part of the Bureau of the European Democratic Group, responsible for guiding the political leadership of the group, in 1982‚Äì83. After boundary changes, Beazley was re-elected for Bedfordshire South in the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same election his son Christopher Beazley was elected as MEP for Cornwall and Plymouth. Peter Beazley was put on the powerful Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy Committee, and served as Vice-Chairman from 1984 to 1989. At the 1989 election his majority was cut to 2,977. Political views Beazley maintained his support for European integration when opinion within the Conservative Party began to grow sceptical in the early 1990s. He complained that those critical of European Community decision-making often forgot that the European Parliament scrutinised all legislation through committees, which could call experts to give evidence about their effects. Aged 70, he announced in 1993 that he would stand down at the next election; that year he received the CBE. During his last few weeks in office, Beazley worked to stop a European Commission proposal to ban the sale of motorbikes with over 100 brake horsepower. Retirement The former junior health minister Edwina Currie was selected to succeed him as Conservative candidate, but lost the seat to Labour in the 1994 election. After the election Beazley ruefully observed \\"They told us it would be a doddle with Edwina\\".

Timkat () is the Orthodox Tewahedo celebration of Epiphany. It is celebrated on January 19th (or 20th in a leap year), corresponding to the 11th day of Terr in the Ethiopian calendar. Timkat celebrates the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan. This festival is best known for its ritual reenactment of baptism (similar to such reenactments performed by numerous Christian the Holy Land when they visit the Jordan). Ethiopian Tewahedo priests at a Timkat ceremony in Jan Meda. During the ceremonies of Timkat, the Tabot, a model of the Ark of the Covenant, which is present on every Ethiopian altar (somewhat like the Western altar stone), is reverently wrapped in rich cloth and borne in procession on the head of the priest. The Tabot, which is otherwise rarely seen by the laity, represents the manifestation of Jesus as the Messiah when he came to the Jordan for baptism. The Divine Liturgy is celebrated near a stream or pool early in the morning (around 2 a.m.). Then the nearby body of water is blessed towards dawn and sprinkled on the participants, some of whom enter the water and immerse themselves, symbolically renewing their baptismal vows. But the festival does not end there; Donald N. Levine describes a typical celebration of the early 1960s: UNESCO inscribed Timkat (Ethiopian Epiphany) in 2019 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

Its filmmakers, Michael Cain and Matt Radecki, sifted through the video-diary footage to piece together the story of Kirkham's life, focusing on the seven years in which he and his family struggled with his addiction to crack cocaine. It was shown at Sundance in 2006. The film was the subject of a lawsuit by his ex-wife Tammie. Variety gave the film a middling review, finding the central figure unpleasant and unsympathetic and the production values inevitably low. Film Threat found it \\"an unbelievably candid glimpse into the contradictions of cocaine addiction\\", and praised Kirkham's articulate and authentic self-portrait. OutNow.CH found it had a certain fascination beyond what would be expected. Rick Kirkham Rick Kirkham was a reporter for Inside Edition who appeared on a segment called \\"Inside Adventure\\". From the age of 14, he filmed more than 3,000 hours of a video diary; this included footage during his tenure on Inside Edition during which he was addicted to crack cocaine. He appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2007 to talk about his addiction, and clips of his video diary were shown. On Oprah, Kirkham said he was a functional addict, and that he would smoke crack at night instead of sleeping, remaining high for about six hours, and report for work at Inside Edition two hours later. Kirkham went days without sleep during this time. He said he once interviewed President George H. W. Bush while high on crack; the subject was drug abuse. In 2020, he starred in the Netflix documentary Tiger King, where he discussed a documentary he attempted to make about Joe Exotic's tiger park in Oklahoma.
