On 18 May 2011, she became the first female activist to be convicted for a role in the Bahraini uprising, and was named a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. On 27 March 2011, Mubarak was driving with her 8-year-old son and her 14- and 15-year-old nieces in the car when she was stopped near Riffa (southwest of Manama) by a police checkpoint. A police officer told her that she was \\"playing music calling for the overthrow of the regime\\", and asked her to turn down the volume. Mubarak refused, instead asking the officer for his identification. According to the police officers at the scene, Mubarak then stepped from her vehicle, grabbed the shirt of an officer, and shoved him. Mubarak, in contrast, alleges that after being insulted and cursed by security officers, a man in civilian clothing tried to force her into a car; not knowing that he was a security officer, she resisted and was struck in the head by the officer. Mubarak was then taken to a police station in Rifaa. She later stated that she was beaten by policewomen while in custody there, before being transferred to a police station in Isa Town, where she was beaten again. After authorities discovered that she had participated in the March protests at Pearl Roundabout, as well as a poem she had written about revolution and freedom for her son, she was charged with \\"assault on a public officer\\", \\"incitement for hatred of the regime\\", \\"participation in a rally with the intent to commit crimes\\", and \\"undermining public order\\" by Bahrain's National Safety Court of First Instance, a military court. On 18 May 2011, she was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Amnesty International reported that she was denied a lawyer both before and during her trial, meeting her lawyer for the first time one week after receiving her sentence. On 8 June 2011, her sentence was reduced by an appeals court to eighteen months' imprisonment. This sentence was upheld by a court of cassation on 30 January 2012. Mubarak's family expressed concern for her health, as she was receiving treatment for ovarian cysts shortly before her imprisonment. The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights described Mubarak's imprisonment as \\"illegal detention for merely exercising [her] rights to freedom of expression in accordance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19\\", and called for her immediate release. On 30 January 2012, Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience, \\"sentenced in an unfair trial before a military court on spurious charges for standing up for her rights\\"; the organization also called for her release. Although her sentence was upheld by a Bahraini court in late January 2012, Mubarak was released on 6 February 2012. At a rally in al-Muqsha organized by the Bahraini opposition, she was welcomed by thousands of supporters waving national flags while revolutionary music played in the background.Bahrain releases Canadian, female protester. Agence France Press (AFP). 2012-02-07. Retrieved on 2012-02-18. Mubarak reported difficulties following her release, including 800 dinars in unpaid car loans and a lawsuit from her employer for \\"unauthorized absence\\". Unable to find work, she lives partly on donations from sympathizers.

Her abductor, Frank Jarvis Atwood, was traced through witness testimony and physical evidence (which the abductor alleged in a later appeal was planted on his car). Seven months later, Vicki's remains were found in a desert area away and Atwood was found guilty of first degree murder. He has been on death row in Arizona since 1987. Background On Monday, September 17, 1984, Vicki asked and received permission from her mother, Debbie Carlson, to ride her bike to a mailbox to post a birthday card to her aunt. This was the first time Carlson had allowed any of her children to go out on their own, previously using the buddy system. After 20 minutes, Carlson sent Vicki's 11-year-old sister Stephanie to look for her; Stephanie found Vicki's bike lying on the side of the road a few blocks away, and one block from the elementary school. Carlson placed Vicki's bike in her car trunk and called the Pima County Sheriff's Department. Detective Gary Dhaemers responded, and a few hours later a command center was set up. Apprehension of suspect Initial FBI composite of a woman seen with a child matching Hoskinson's description prior to Frank Atwood being identified as the perpetrator. Not long after Hoskinson's abduction was publicized, a tipster reported seeing a young female matching the victim's description in a store, accompanied by an adult female. A composite sketch was created of the girl's companion, but eventually, police determined the sighting was unrelated to the abduction of Hoskinson.Zorn, Steven. “The Predator.” The FBI Files, season 3, episode 6, Discovery Channel, 20 Nov. 2000. After interviews with possible witnesses, Sam Hall, a coach at an elementary school, stated he saw a suspicious-looking driver parked in a vehicle in an alley beside the school on September 17. Hall had been supervising a group of students at play when he noticed a suspicious vehicle. According to Hall, the driver was making strange gestures and was struggling with the manual gearshift lever. He memorized the license plate, ran to his car to get a notepad and wrote it down. He later gave it to police after hearing Vicki went missing. A little girl said the driver made an obscene gesture to her as he cruised by her house. Another saw the driver back into a telephone pole. The trace on the license plate led to a 28-year-old Los Angeles man named Frank Jarvis Atwood. Agents ran a background check and found kidnapping and child molestation charges. Atwood was out on parole in California. They went to the address where Atwood's vehicle was registered. It was the home of Atwood's parents, Frank Jarvis Atwood Sr., a retired army brigadier general and his wife, who was more protective of their son.The FBI Files, Season 3 Episode 6. A few hours later, Atwood called his parents stating his car had broken down in Texas and he needed money wired to get it fixed. His mother wrote down the address in Kerrville, Texas, where Atwood awaited a new transmission. His father copied the information and drove to a nearby payphone and reported the address to the FBI. Agents from the FBI's Texas Bureau detained Atwood and his traveling companion, James McDonald, at the mechanic shop on September 20 and impounded the car. During questioning, Atwood told investigators he was in Vicki's neighborhood on September 17, the day she disappeared, staying in a nearby park. About 3:00 PM, he left to buy drugs and returned to the park about 5:00PM, but did not say where he was during the two-hour period. McDonald corroborated Atwood's story, and told investigators that he and Atwood had an argument in the park about 3:00. After that, Atwood left for two hours and returned with bloodstains on his hands and clothing. Atwood told McDonald he got into a fight with a drug dealer and stabbed him. Investigators found two men who claimed Atwood spent two nights in their trailer. One of them, known as Mad Dog, claimed Atwood's clothes and hands were bloodstained, and that they had suggested Atwood get rid of his clothes. Atwood told them that he stabbed a double-crossing drug dealer. Evidence While no physical evidence in the car could be linked to Vicki's person, accident reconstruction experts matched pink paint on the front bumper of Atwood's vehicle to the color of the paint on Vicki's bike, and traced damage to the car's gravel pan to one of the bike's pedals. Traces of nickel plating from the bumper were also found on the bike. Returning to the site where the bike was found, investigators discovered damage to the mailbox post about 12 inches above ground, consistent with the height of Atwood's sports car, and believed this to be the spot where the car allegedly struck Vicki's bike at a slow speed. Atwood's alleged bloodstained clothing from the day of Vicki's disappearance was never recovered. Arrest and trial Ten days after Vicki's disappearance, Atwood was arrested and charged with one count of kidnapping. A month after Vicki's disappearance, Atwood returned to Arizona to stand trial. Because of the publicity of the case in Tucson, the trial was moved to Phoenix. Jury selection took almost 6 weeks, and bail was denied. On December 3, 1984, Atwood pleaded not guilty to kidnapping charges. Discovery of remains On April 12, 1985, a hiker found a small human skull in the Tucson desert, about from where the bike had been found. The skeleton had been scattered by animals. Due to the state of the remains, the cause of death could not be determined, nor whether the child had been sexually abused. Dental records confirmed they were Vicki's remains. Traces of adipocere found on the skull fixed the time that the body had been placed in the desert to within 48 hours of Vicki's disappearance. Atwood was indicted and found guilty of first degree murder, and was sentenced to death on May 8, 1987. During his years on death row, Atwood has \\"gotten married, been baptized in the Greek Orthodox Christian church, obtained two associate degrees, a bachelor's degree in English/pre-law and a master's degree in literature. He has written six books, five of which have been published. He's also working with people on the outside to create a website\\". , he was one of the longest-seated prisoners on death row. He claims that police tampered with the evidence found on his car, and that no physical evidence has been found placing Vicki in his car. His ongoing appeals for judicial re-review of his case have been denied. Legacy After her daughter's murder, Debbie Carlson became a victims' rights activist. She helped establish a victims' advocacy group called \\"We the People\\"; worked for the passage of Arizona's Victims' Bill of Rights, which was passed in 1990; and helped institute Southern Arizona's Amber Alert system in 2000. The case was covered in the third season of Forensic Files and The FBI Files.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zHWjga96Y See also * Disappearance of Etan Patz * List of solved missing persons cases * Murder of Leiby Kletzky References External links * Category:1980s missing person cases Category:1984 in Arizona Category:1984 murders in the United States Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:History of Tucson, Arizona Category:Kidnapped American children Category:Missing person cases in Arizona Category:September 1984 events in the United States ","title":"Murder of Vicki Lynne Hoskinson"},{"id":"34551015","text":"The Tower is the tallest building on the right. The tallest building on the left is the Kansas City, Kansas City Hall. Cross Lines Tower is a 15-story 175 foot high building that from 1951 to 1969 was the tallest building in Kansas City, Kansas. It is currently the tallest building in downtown and is the city's third tallest building – only a foot shorter than the other two. In its glory days in the 1950s and 1960s as a 250-room hotel at 1015 North 7th Street it was frequently used by visiting American Football League teams and was where singer Patsy Cline spent her last night before being killed in a plane crash while flying back to Nashville from Fairfax Airport. It is currently a retirement home. The site is the former Wyandotte County, Kansas jail that was built in 1880 and used until 1931. The jail site remained abandoned even though hotel plans were made in 1937. The jail was razed in November 1949 in preparation for the new Town House Hotel designed by Eugene J. Stern which opened August 6, 1951.http://www.kckpl.lib.ks.us/documents/retirementcenter.pdf It was later renamed Town House Motor Hotel. On March 3, 1963, Patsy Cline and her entourage stayed at the hotel during a benefit concert at Memorial Hall for former KCKN/KCMK disc jockey Cactus Jack Call who had died in a January car accident. On March 4 Cline was unable to fly out of Fairfax Airport because it was fogged in. She turned down an offer to take a 16-hour drive back to Nashville. She checked out of the hotel at 12:30 p.m. on March 5, the day of her fatal flight. In 1969 Wyandotte Towers which is also 15 stories but one foot higher opened. In 1972 Rainbow Towers (now called Vista Condominiums) opened. It is also 15 stories and one foot higher. All of the structures in Kansas City, Kansas are not taller than any of the 40 tallest buildings in neighboring Kansas City, Missouri. The Town House closed on June 22, 1970 because of mortgage foreclosure, interest payments and outstanding back taxes. In March 1971 it opened as the Ramada Inn – Center City. On March 29, 1979, it was sold to become a retirement center with grants from Housing and Urban Development.

It contains a type species, Largocephalosaurus polycarpon, and a second species L. qianensis. L. polycarpon was initially interpreted as an eosauropterygian sauropterygian closely related to European pachypleurosaurs and nothosaurids. However following additional preparation of the postcranial skeleton and the discovery of a second better known species L. qianensis, Li et al. (2014) reinterpreted Largocephalosaurus as a basal member of the family Saurosphargidae and a close relative of Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis. According to Li et al. (2014), saurosphargids did not belong to Sauropterygia, although they were closely related to it, forming its sister taxon. Discovery The type species of Largocephalosaurus, L. polycarpon is known only from the holotype WIGM SPC V 1009 a nearly complete and articulated skull and skeleton missing most of its tail and measuring more than in length, housed at the Wuhan Institute of Geology and Mineral Recourses. SPC V 1009 was collected from Member II of the Guanling Formation, dating to the Pelsonian substage of the mid-late Anisian stage of the early Middle Triassic, about 243 million years ago, at Luoping County of Yunnan Province. While L. polycarpon was being studied at the WIGM, three specimens of what was later named L. qianensis, where prepared at the Geological Museum of Peking University and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. These three specimens were collected in 2008 about 100 km northeast of the type locality of L. polycarpon at Xinmin District of Panxian County, southwestern Guizhou Province. They, like SPC V 1009, came from Member II of the Guanling Formation, dating to the late Anisian. Out of these specimens, IVPP V 15638, a nearly complete skeleton exposed in view from below with only the back of the tail missing, was chosen to represent the holotype of L. qianensis. The other two specimen are referable to L. qianensis and include GMPKU-P-1532-A, a skull with a neck vertebra in view from above, and GMPKU-P-1532-B, an incomplete postcranial skeleton in view from above, with the back portion of the mandible preserved, but missing most of the tail. All specimens of Largocephalosaurus came from the Lagerstätte discovered during a 2007 geological mapping project with a diverse record of marine life called Luoping Biota, that yielded, apart from Largocephalosaurus, various invertebrates, fish, basal ichthyosaurs, Atopodentatus, the advanced saurosphargid Sinosaurosphargis, and several species of eosauropterygian, including both pachypleurosaurs and nothosaurids. Etymology Largocephalosaurus was first described and named by Long Cheng, Xiaohong Chen, Xiongwei Zeng and Yongjian Cai in 2012 with the type species Largocephalosaurus polycarpon. The generic name is said to be derived from Latin largus, meaning \\"large\\", and cephalus, meaning \\"head\\", and from Greek sauros, meaning \\"lizard\\", a common suffix for genus names of extinct reptiles. In classical Latin, the proper word for \\"head\\" is caput, while in ancient Greek kephalē (κεφαλή) was used for \\"head\\".Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Kephalos (Κέφαλος) was the first name of various Greek mythological and historical figures that was rendered in Latin as Cephalus.Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press. The specific name polycarpon is said to be derived from Latin poly, meaning \\"many\\", plus \\"carpon\\", meaning \\"ossified carpals\\", in reference to the eleven carpal ossifications the forelimb of L. polycarpon shows, resulting in the unique hand bone formula of 2-3-4-5-5. In classical Latin the proper word for \\"many\\" is multus, while in ancient Greek they used the word polys (πολύς). A second species L. qianensis was named by Chun Li, Da-Yong Jiang, Long Cheng, Xiao-Chun Wu and Olivier Rieppel in 2014. Its specific name is derived from Qian, a shortened alternative spelling for Guizhou, plus the Latin suffix -ensis meaning \\"from\\", in reference to the different occurrence of the species - while the specimens of L. qianensis were discovered in Guizhou Province, the only known specimen of L. polycarpon came from the neighboring Yunnan Province. Description Largocephalosaurus is a basal saurosphargid, less modified morphologically from the archetypal diapsid reptile compared to advanced saurosphargids like Sinosaurosphargis. However, even in its original description that interpreted it as an eosauropterygian sauropterygian, several traits later identified as saurosphargid were noted. These include back vertebrae that show elongated, distally expanded transverse projections, and its broadened and flattened chest ribs. Yet, Largocephalosaurus unlike other saurosphargids retains an elongate body shape, a well-developed supratemporal fenestra, an oval suborbital fenestra (although much reduced compared to non-saurosphargids) and an incomplete dorsal osteoderm carapace. Additionally, the advanced saurosphargids Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis have broader and flatter rib baskets, and also transverse projections of back vertebrae and proximal portions of chest ribs that are much more robust than in Largocephalosaurus, being much wider than the spacing between them. Other differences include: the presence of three or four teeth on the premaxilla, and its exclusion from the external nostril outline; an elongated frontal bone back-side facing projection; the presence of a row of large osteoderms on the top of the neural spines, in the midline of the partial osteoderm shield; and similarly rounded coracoid and pubis bone with the coracoid foramen and the obturator fenestra present and open (respectively). Due to the fact that the holotype skeleton of L. polycarpon is still only partially prepared, Li et al. (2014) refrained from providing a revised description for it. Nevertheless, at least 9 morphological differences from the second the species L. qianensis were observed. These include the paired parietal bone, the large pineal foramen, the oval eye-sockets, and the presence of 33 presacral vertebrae (9 neck and 24 back vertebrae) and two sacral vertebrae, in L. qianensis. Additionally, a distinct palatal fossa exists on the upper surface of palatine bone in L. qianensis, and the retroarticular process is very short. The back osteoderms of L. qianensis are elongated granular in shape, and covering the sides of body. Finally, its shoulder portion of the chest ribs is broadened in a hook-like projection, while lacking the crest on its upper surface like the one seen in L. polycarpon. Phylogeny Largocephalosaurus was first included in a phylogenetic analysis in its original description. Due to the lack of preparation of the holotype, especially of the postcranial portion, and the fact that no other saurosphargids or stem sauropterygians (like Eusaurosphargis and Helveticosaurus) were included, L. polycarpon was recovered in a position most closely related to Wumengosaurus within Eosauropterygia, basal to the European pachypleurosaurs and nothosaurids. However, following additional preparation of the postcranial skeleton and the discovery of a second better known species L. qianensis, Li et al. (2014) presented an analysis which includes Eusaurosphargis, Helveticosaurus and all known saurosphargid species. The following cladogram is simplified after their results. The removal / inclusion of Ichthyopterygia was found to affect the topology the most - switching the positions of the Eusaurosphargis+Helveticosaurus and Thalattosauriformes clades, and altering the positions of several taxa within Eosauropterygia, which are not shown.

The Brewery, known locally as the 'Big K', located at Porter Street, Kalgoorlie, was the last survivor of nineteen breweries that once traded in the Eastern Goldfields. History The company was floated on 24 February 1896, with capital of £12,000. The first chairman was Robert McKenzie (MLC) and his fellow directors were James Hurtle Cummins, S. Hocking and John Joseph Dwyer. The first general manager and brewer, was J. H. Shickel(a German brewer and the proprietor of the Caledonian Brewery in South Australia). The brewery was the second brewery to be established in the Western Australian goldfields, with the first beers produced in September 1896. Following the death of Shickel of pneumonia in June 1897, the company appointed William Elliott as their brewer. Alfred Deakin subsequently replaced Elliott as the company's brewer in January 1900, a position he held for over forty years. Cummins was subsequently appointed Managing Director in 1904. In 1912 the company purchased the Lion Brewery in Coolgardie, followed by the Langsford Brewery in 1918 and Union Brewery in 1919. The headquarters of the brewery were then moved from Porter Street to the former Union Brewery's buildings in Brookman Street. In 1920 the company purchased the Boulder City Brewery. By 1924 the company had taken over all the rival breweries in the goldfields area. James Cummins' daughter, Alice Mary Cummins, although educated as a lawyer, began working at her father's Kalgoorlie Brewing and Ice Company Ltd as a cash ledgerkeeper in 1928. She proceeded to learn and master all aspects of the brewing business from the technical, engineering, refrigeration through to marketing. Alice Cummins then set about re-establishing the business. In 1929 the company established a second brewery in the wheatbelt town of Merredin. Cummins made her director of the Merredin brewery. In the early 1930s Alice urged her father to turn from the production of English-style beer and introduce the top-fermentation process of German lager. When James Cummins died in London on 19 March 1936, of acute peritonitis, Alice became managing director and the major shareholder of his enterprises. With support for the old-style beer flagging, rival breweries expanding and hotels being progressively 'tied' by competitors, her situation was critical. Undaunted, she installed new plant and equipment at a cost of £125,000 (increasing the brewery's output and storage capacity), and boosted the company's outlets by acquiring hotels for the company and in her own right at Kalgoorlie, Merredin, Moorine Rock, Sandstone, Boyanup, Tammin, Yellowdine, Wagin and Meckering. She triumphed when the instant popularity of Hannan's Lager in September 1937 was reflected in its escalating consumption figures. In the 1940s she repeatedly fought off numerous takeover bids by the Swan Brewery. Alice Cummins died of a heart attack on 27 June 1943. In February 1945 the executors of her estate agreed to sell her 83% shareholding in the Kalgoorlie Brewing and Ice Company to the Swan Brewery for £200,000. The existing brewing operations continued in Kalgoorlie and Merredin, with the Swan Brewery being represented on the board. On 5 September 1981 Alan Bond, through his company, Bond Corporation, made a $150 million offer for the Swan Brewery. On 26 October 1981 Bond Corporation triumphantly declared that the take-over had succeeded. The assets of the Swan Brewery included the subsidiary ‘Kalgoorlie Brewing Co’. On 21 November 1982, just 12 months after the takeover, the Kalgoorlie Brewery ceased operations and the brewery was dismantled.

He served two years (1867–68) as a Unionist member of the Wisconsin State Senate and one (1883) as a Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from Dane County.  Background and war experience  Warner was born in Batavia, New York on February 23, 1836; received a public school education; and became a farmer. He came to Wisconsin in 1852 and settled at Windsor, Wisconsin. In 1857 he enrolled in classes at the University of Wisconsin.Lathrop, John H., et al. \\"Document G: Ninth Annual Report of Regents of University of Wisconsin for 1856\\"; p. 50; in Governor's Message and Accompanying Documents for the Year 1857 Vol. I 1857 [Covers 1856] During the American Civil War he assisted in raising a company for the 36th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was mustered in as captain in March, 1864. They joined the Army of the Potomac in May. Within one hundred days the regiment was nearly annihilated in battles around Richmond and Petersburg, during which time Warner received commissions to major, lieutenant-colonel and full colonel. He lost an arm on August 14, 1864, while in command of the regiment at the Second Battle of Deep Bottom. He returned to his regiment in November and commanded it until the close of the war. His regiment participated in the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign in 1864 and 1865; was in the final charge April 2 at Petersburg and present at the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House April 9, 1865; and mustered out July 12, 1865.  Public office  Warner was elected to the Senate as a Unionist in 1867 (succeeding fellow Unionist Willard Chandler) and as a Republican in 1868. He was succeeded by Republican Nelson Williams. In 1873, he ran for the Assembly's 2nd Dane County district, which at that time consisted of the Towns of Blooming Grove, Burke, Dunn and Windsor, and the City of Madison) to succeed fellow Republican Levi Baker Vilas, who was not a candidate for re-election.

Amina Kamara was born in London, England in 1987 to Sierra Leonean parents, Abass Alieu Kamara and Kadi Kamara She grew up in North West London and attended school at Harlesden Primary School before moving on to Queens Park Community School in 1997. As tough as life in Harlesden was for ethnic minorities, Amina Kamara always looked up to her both her parents and especially her brother Alieu Kamara who was 10 years older. Alieu Kamara usually took the responsibility of looking after and advising Amina and her 2 sisters. She socialised well with her peers and took pride in the people of her neighbourhood, and still today she regularly visits. She attended QPCS up to year 9 and then her parents decided to move to East London. Amina then attended a school in Chingford called Rush Croft School and finished her GCSEs there. Separated from her West African origins, her one great wish was to travel around the world and experience different cultures and meet all sorts of people, including being a strong part of the growth of her home country Sierra Leone. She then moved on to Waltham Forest College where she began to study Tourism for 3 years and achieved an Advanced Vocational Certificate in Tourism. Highly influenced by her brother Alieu, Amina Kamara lived her young days as a tom boy, climbing over fences to play football and basketball with the guys, never knowing she would eventually one day become a beauty pageant winner of an African region where she would then explore her lifelong intent to travel the world. She then attended the University of Kent to study a BA Hons in Tourism Management, where she learnt the importance of Tourism planning and development and managing tourism in countries. Amina’s time at Kent was tough due to social differences amongst her peers. At this stage, feeling distant from her peers, Amina had to drop her tom boy lifestyle and began wearing dresses and make up. Although Amina’s dream towards touring the world was coming closer and closer, she still faced much difficulties with her social life. Just as things began to pick up, she received a phone call from Alieu her brother, to inform her that he had travelled to America and he had been diagnosed due to a brain tumour. Fear for his life made it difficult for Amina to keep focused at Uni, but he returned to London reassuring Amina not to worry about his conditions as everything would be ok. When he returned to America, Amina was soon to find out from her mum that he had died from an aggressive brain tumour. It took Amina roughly 3–4 months before she could get back to her studies motivated by his strong words and influences. Sooner in life, Amina then also picked up an interest in modelling and engaged in various modelling activities before coming across an invite by Nana Tamakloe to participate in the first ever Miss West Africa beauty pageant.

Its name appears to originate from Syriac ' meaning \\"citadel\\" or \\"town\\". Other sources connect it to ' \\"farming\\". It was originally built on the Tigris, across the river from the later medieval city of Wasit. The city was originally a significant Sasanian city built on the west bank of the Tigris where Greek speaking deportees from north-western Syria were settled by Shapur I in the mid third century A.D. According to Syriac tradition, Mar Mari is said to have preached and performed miracles and converted many of its inhabitants to Christianity. Kashkar became an important centre of Christianity in lower Mesopotamia and had its own diocese which lay under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchal Province of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. During a flood the Tigris burst its banks leaving Kashkar on its east bank. The medieval city of Wasit was built on the west bank of the new channel by al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who drew off the population of Kashkar, which eventually turned it to a ghost town. By the middle of the twelfth century Kashkar ceased to exist as a bishopric see.

This track is under the jurisdiction of Bangladesh Railway. History From 1878, the railway route from Kolkata, then called Calcutta, to Siliguri was in two laps. The first lap was a 185 km journey along the Eastern Bengal State Railway from Calcutta Station (later renamed Sealdah) to Damookdeah Ghat on the southern bank of the Padma River, then across the river in a ferry and the second lap of the journey. A 336 km metre gauge line of the North Bengal Railway linked Saraghat on the northern bank of the Padma to Siliguri. The 1.8 km Hardinge Bridge across the Padma came up in 1912. In 1926 the metre-gauge section north of the bridge was converted to broad gauge, and so the entire Calcutta - Siliguri route became broad-gauge. With the partition of India in 1947, the portions of the track in Pakistani territory, later Bangladeshi territory, got separated. The southern portion through Gede is still functional and Maitree Express runs to Kolkata on this track. In the north the Chilahati–Haldibari section has gone out of operation. As of 2010, the long Saidpur-Chilahati line was in such a bad shape that there was no fast train between Dhaka and Chilahati. In 2010, Taka 103.68 crore was sanctioned for the development of this line. Branch lines Sara–Sirajganj Railway Company constructed the Sara–Sirajganj line in 1915–16. The Brahmaputra–Sultanpur Railway Company constructed the long metre-gauge railway track from Santahar to Fulchhari (Tistamukh) in 1899–1900. Presently the line is up to Balashi Ghat in Phulchhari Upazila. The long Bonarpara-Kaunia line was constructed in 1905. North Bengal state railway opened a metre gauge line to Kaunia in 1879. Two narrow gauge lines were laid by Eastern Bengal Railway from Kaunia to Dharla River, thereby creating the Kaunia–Dharlla State Railway.

Establishment and duties Based in Nairobi, the CACAS served as a caretaker for Somalia's airspace since the collapse of the central government in the early 1990s following the outbreak of the civil war. The organization collected over-flight revenues on behalf of the country, re-investing the proceeds into air traffic control and airport maintenance. It had among its objectives the upkeep and operation of services and equipment earmarked for international air transport activities, including local operations within the Mogadishu Flight Information Region and humanitarian flights. Additionally, CACAS was mandated with forming and operating a nucleus civil aviation administration to oversee its functions, establishing protocols and regulations vis-a-vis the maintenance and operation of civil aviation activities, and devising and implementing a training program geared toward national-level staff. However, these latter tasks were reportedly not completed. It is also uncertain where exactly the estimated $9 to $10 million in annual revenue generated by the airspace management services were invested. SCAA is now directed by Ahmed Moallim Hassan. Transitional period In 2002, the newly formed Transitional National Government (TNG) briefly re-assumed control of Somalia's airspace with the re-establishment of the Somali Civil Aviation Authority (SOMCAA) by the Ministry of Air and Land Transport. With the creation of the TNG's successor the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, the reconstituted central government of Somalia resumed formal preparations in 2011 to transfer supervision of the country's airspace from the CACAS to its aviation ministry. After reassuming control of the capital Mogadishu in mid-2011, the TFG also on a contractual basis delegated airport maintenance and operation duties at the Aden Adde International Airport to the Dubai-based SKA Air and Logistics, a private firm specializing in conflict zones. Transfer of airspace control After meeting with CACAS representatives, Abdullahi Elmoge Hersi, Somalia's Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications, announced in May 2013 that the Somali federal government would reassume control of the country's airspace by December 31. In preparation for the transition, staff within Somalia were set to receive training during the rest of the year. Over 100 airspace personnel were also scheduled to be transferred to Mogadishu for management duties. On 17 December 2014, Minister of Air and Land Transport Said Jama Mohamed announced that the Somali federal government had regained control of its airspace after reaching an agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization. The minister also indicated that Somalia's airspace would be managed from the capital Mogadishu, and additional professionals would be trained for the purpose. On the 28 December 2017 the Somali government regained control of their airspace for the first time in nearly 27 years after control was passed from ICAO to the Somali Federal Government.

It was also known as the Michigan Aircraft Company Model 1, and the Lambert Model 1344. Design and development Vance Breese partnered with Detroit auto salesman, Charles Dallas to produce a modern, transcontinental, all-metal construction cargo aircraft. The aircraft was engineered by Art Mankey with some part-time design work by Jerry Vultee, who would go on to develop a slightly larger concept called the Vultee V-1. The aircraft is a six-passenger, all-metal, single- engine, low-wing monoplane with hydraulically retractable conventional landing gear. The center fuselage is welded steel tubing. The cockpit used a split forward slanting windshield popular on large aircraft of the period, with rearward sliding canopy panels over the pilots. There is a large passenger doorway just behind the right wing. The aircraft was constructed around an eight-inch steel tube jig that was removed after assembly. The first engine used was sourced from a Boeing P-12E from Selfridge Field using a NACA cowling. Four small passenger windows were expanded for better visibility. The engine was upgraded in 1936 to an Pratt & Whitney SRB-1535 with additional fuel capacity of total. Operational history Construction of the Model 1 started in September 1932. The first flight was performed by Vance Breese and Frederick Coe. *1933, on May 1 the aircraft was sold to a new company formed by Charles Dallas, and F.A. Culver called the Michigan Aircraft Company. The model 1 was renamed the Michigan Aircraft Company Model 1 on 7 June. *1934, registrations for the aircraft were usually only for a few months for testing, the aircraft was sold regularly with new temporary registration. The Model 1 was sold to the Dallas owned Select Motor Sales, and again in March to Charles Dallas for testing, and once more to the Lambert Aircraft Corporation where it was registered as the Lambert Model 1344, and sold right back again to Select Motor Sales. *1935 the aircraft was sold again, back to Vance Breese who proposed the aircraft as a bomber for the Jack Holt and Christy Cabanne Universal Studios movie Storm over the Andes. Breese prepared the aircraft for the Bendix Trophy race but did not enter that year. *1936 The aircraft was sold to Jacqueline Cochran in October for use in the 1936 Bendix Race. Pilot Wes Smith performed a gear up landing on orders from Cochran's husband Floyd Odlum. *1937 Cochran sold the aircraft to Paul Mantz's Union Air Services in January, and it was immediately re-registered for Mexico. The Model 1 was crashed outside of Mexico City by ferry pilot Cloyd Peart Clevenger on 10 January 1937. It was being delivered for use by Col Roberto Fierro in the Spanish Civil War. Clevenger was later jailed for smuggling planes in violation of the United States Neutrality Act.

The highways formed parts of the old alignment of MD 216 on either side of Interstate 95 (I-95) in North Laurel in southeastern Howard County, Maryland. MD 983 had a length of and ran on the east side of I-95. MD 983A spanned on the west side of I-95. MD 216 through North Laurel was built in the early 1920s. The segments of MD 983 were designated when MD 216 was relocated east of I-95 in the early 1960s and west of I-95 in the late 1970s. In 2017, both MD 983 and MD 983A were removed from the state highway system and transferred to county maintenance. Route description View north along MD 983A in Scaggsville in 2016, a short time before it was transferred to county maintenance MD 983 began at a dead end at the Patuxent River in North Laurel; the dead end is on the opposite side of the river from the northern end of Ninth Street in the city of Laurel. The highway headed northwest as two-lane Old Scaggsville Road, which has intersections with Pilgrim Avenue and All Saints Road, which provide access to MD 216. MD 983 veered north ahead of its intersection with Stansfield Road, which passes under I-95 and indirectly connected with MD 983A. The state highway ended at the state-county maintenance boundary southeast of and adjacent to the MD 216-I-95 cloverleaf interchange. Old Scaggsville Road continues as a county street that curves east before ending in a residential community. MD 983A began at a cul-de-sac on the west side of the MD 216-I-95 interchange. The highway headed west as two-lane Scaggsville Road. MD 983A reached its western terminus at Leishear Road; the road continues west as Old Scaggsville Road, which was designated MD 216E. History The two segments of MD 983 were part of the old alignment of MD 216, which crossed the Patuxent River on a bridge at Ninth Street in Laurel. The highway was constructed as a gravel road from Laurel to Scaggsville in 1923; that road was paved in 1956. MD 216's present bridge across the river at Seventh Street was built in 1960. The highway was relocated to its present alignment from Main Street in Laurel to the site of the I-95 interchange in 1963, leaving behind much of what is now MD 983. The interchange was built in 1970 and 1971. MD 216 was moved to its present alignment from the interchange west to Leishear Road between then and 1978, leaving behind MD 983A. The Patuxent River crossing at Ninth Street was removed, resulting in MD 983's present dead end at the river, in 1985. MD 983A connected directly with MD 216 at the Leishear Road intersection until MD 216 was relocated to its present course between Leishear Road and U.S. Route 29 in 2005. On February 2, 2017, MD 983 and MD 983A were removed from the state highway system and transferred to county maintenance.

Formerly with Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consultancy where he worked on European gas matters, he later directed a Paris-based, independent think tank and publication center, Institut Choiseul, where he founded Politique Américaine, the French leading quarterly journal on US affairs with a board of US policymakers and scholars such as Joseph Bye, Francis Fukuyama, James Schlesinger and many others. Mireur was chief editor of the journal between 2004 and 2011. He is also the author of two books on American politics and society (see below After Bush: Why America Will Not Change and Obama's World).http://lecercle.lesechos.fr/auteur/yannick-mireur Education A graduate of Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris, Yannick Mireur earned an MA and a PhD from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Boston where he was awarded a Fulbright Program scholarship. He has taught at the French Military Academy of Saint-Cyr and is a frequent guest of leading French networks and stations to comment on US and international affairs. Writings Under press in August 2008, as Barack Obama had not yet won the Democratic presidential nomination, Après Bush went against the mainstream arguing that the strength of American Conservatism would survive the presidency of George W. Bush. While the book reckoned that America needed to reinvent a social contract and a global leadership, it also argued that the lasting hey-day of Liberalism since FDR had been followed by a Conservative cycle that was still running its course, as the later emergence of the Tea Party movement would show. However corroded, the post-Bush Conservative movement was still a powerful one in American politics. Reminding the reader of Arthur Schlesinger’s cycles of American history, the book analyzes the sources of America's various political currents and their legacies. In his foreword, former French Foreign Minister Hubert Védrine wrote: “After Bush undertakes the more ambitious task of reconstituting the richness and complexity of these issues and events in American history and in deeper American political ideals.” thumb Published three years later, Le Monde d’Obama largely centers on the China-US relationship and international affairs. Half way into the Obama presidency, the book argues that the main force in international politics in the 21st century is the rise of individual aspirations and the desire for breathing space by populations suffocating under authoritarian rule, as the so-called \\"Arab spring\\" illustrated. Both books go at length explaining American political progressivism and how it infused Obama’s political thinking, In both books the author argues that America needs to reinvent a progressist project to revive her self-confidence and restore her world leadership. Just like FDR did with his New Deal, forging a new relationship between the state and the market, and with the expansion of American leadership. Just like TR had done before FDR with his Square Deal and a measured, if assertive “speak softly but carry a big stick” approach to rising US power. Mireur has given numerous lectures in the US (Center for Strategic and International Studies, University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, University of Columbia, University of Ottawa, California Technology Institute, etc.), and has contributed editorials to the French business daily Les Échos (France). He is a registered contributor to the newspaper’s online platform Les Cercle Les Echos. He is a regular guest of French TV and radio media outlets and appeared on CNN as guest of Christiane Amanpour.http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/russia-missile-defense-feb-456.cfm His latest book, Hausser le ton! (Raising your voice), published in 2014, addressed French politics. Pointing out to a general climate of moral apathy, the book called for raising the general level of the public debate in France and for abandoning the coded political language that loses people and makes them angry, exacerbating the malaise generated by globalization. The book offers a historical comparison of the key political and policy issues that have riled the French public debate in the 1930s, the 1970s and the 2010s, addressing the issues of leadership, social and class struggle, political institutions and the French elite system. The chapter called \\"Urbanity\\" examines the role of aesthetics in politics, and how architecture is an integral part of political action, arguing that ambitious urban policies would greatly contribute to restore the social fabric. From calling the general status of civil servants outdated to asserting the importance of an assertive European Project in the midst of growing euroskepticism, the book addressed issues that continue to remain center-stage in French politics.

On 1 January, a Moldovan civilian drove through a checkpoint in the zone and was fatally wounded by a Russian peacekeeper. The civilian died a few hours later at a Chişinău hospital. His death raised tension between Russia and Moldova and has revived a decades-old debate over the presence of Russian forces in Moldova. The incident caused demonstrations in Moldova, in which the protesters demanded free passage through the security zone and the withdrawal of Russian troops. On 25 January 2012, a group of European parliamentaries issued a call to the participants of the 5+2 format negotiations to replace the current peacekeeping contingent with an international civil peacekeeping mission. A similar case occurred on 27 January 1995, when another civilian, Constantin Andreev, was fatally wounded by a Russian soldier in the security zone, between Dubăsari and Râbniţa.  The incident  The incident occurred at the 9th peacekeeping checkpoint on a bridge across the Dniester River, between the Transnistrian village of Pârâta and the Moldovan town of Vadul lui Vodă, early in the morning of 1 January 2012. According to reports, civilians Vadim Pisari and Constantin Bologan from the village of Pîrîta on the eastern bank of the Dniester drove a car to the neighbouring town of Vadul lui Vodă. On their way to the town, they passed a bridge with a check point manned by a Russian peacekeeping contingent. The car did not slow down at the check point, rammed the check point's boom barrier, and broke through to the other side. A short time later, Pisari and Bologan were returning to Pîrîta via the same route. When their car entered the bridge again, at 7:15 a.m. local time, the driver disobeyed repeated demands to pull over. Vyacheslav Kozhukhar, the chief of the peacekeeping force, fired several warning shots in the air, and, when those were ignored as well, shot at the driver's side of the man's car, severely wounding him in the back. One bullet hit the car, which continued a short distance before it stopped, the door opened and Mr Pisari fell out, injured. Pisari was rushed to the Emergency Hospital in Chişinău, where he died soon after a surgery was performed on his spine.  Investigation  Moldova and Russia launched a probe into the incident. A special task force led by Russian military prosecutors was formed following an emergency meeting of the Joint Control Commission. In April 2015, in the case of Pisari v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia,CASE OF PISARI v. THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA AND RUSSIA the European Court of Human Rights held, unanimously, that there had been the violations of the Article 2 of European Convention on Human Rights by the Russian Federation as concerned both the killing of the Pisaris' son and the ensuing investigation. The Court held that the Russian Federation should be held responsible for consequences arising from a Russian soldier's actions even though they had not occurred in Russia. The Court further found that the Russian soldier's decision to shoot at the passing vehicle had not been justified and identified procedural problems with the Russian investigation into the case. The association that helped the relatives of the dead to appeal for justice, announced that Russia must have paid the relatives 40580 euros in the next 3 months however, the obligation wasn't fulfilled.  Aftermath  On 4 January, Vadim Pisari was buried in his native village. The funeral procession grew into a protest rally. A protest of some 250 people followed the funeral with demonstrators holding placards calling for Russia to reduce its influence in the region. Among the participants at the funeral on January 4 were Dorin Chirtoacă, members of PL and PLDM. The Moldovan Government allocated 100,000 lei for the funeral of Pisari.

On January 3, a press release of the Moldova's Foreign Ministry states that is not the first time that Ambassador Valery Kuzmin had made inappropriate statements. Foreign Minister Iurie Leancă described the comments by Valery Kuzmin in connection with the murder of Pisari as \\"unfortunate\\" and \\"sarcastic \\".

Several specimens from saber- toothed cats were found there among other species. Location The fissure is located near the Buffalo National River in Boone County, Arkansas, approximately 15 miles south of the town of Harrison. It lies approximately one mile north of the river near the border of Newton and Boone County. The fissure is named after Waldo Conard who owned the land that the fissure is situated on. Discovery The original excavation of the Conard Fissure was performed by Barnum Brown who is best known for his discovery of Tyrannosaurus rex. Waldo Conard searched several fissures and crevices on his land in 1903 trying to locate a lead mine that was rumored there. When in April he found bones instead of lead, he forwarded some of the specimens to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). As was common at the time, AMNH sent Barnum Brown to Arkansas to excavate the discovery. The cache of fossils at the Conard Fissure was a breathtaking scientific discovery in its own right, yet Barnum Brown was fresh off his field work in Hell Creek, Montana just the year prior. Therefore the Conard Fissure excavation was somewhat overshadowed by the enormity of the Tyrannosaurus discovery and not published until 1908.B. Brown, The Conard Fissure, A Pleistocene Bone Deposit in Northern Arkansas...,Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History, Vol IX, Part IV, February 1908. The Fossils On his first trip to Arkansas in 1903 Barnum Brown retrieved some three hundred jaws and many disassociated limb bones and vertebrae. He returned the following year for an even bigger yield including thousands of jaws, skulls limbs and vertebrae. All specimens were transported back to the AMNH where they were cleaned and cataloged. The majority of the specimens were partial remains of small mammals and rodents such as shrews, moles, bats, weasels, and raccoons. There were also medium predator mammals such as wolves and foxes and a large representation of peccary of the genus Mylohyus. Peccary were apparently abundant in pleistocene Arkansas and found in other caves within the Ozark Mountains as well.L.C. Davis, The Biostratigraphy of Peccary Cave...,Arkansas Academy of Science Proceedings, Vol 23, 1969.K.M. Ball, L.C. Davis, Sinkhole Excavations in Peccary Cave...,Arkansas Academy of Science Proceedings, Vol 47, 1993. Large mammals were represented as well including the black bear, Ursus americanus. Most notable among those specimens collected were 15 different specimens of saber-toothed cat. Brown referred to these specimens as \\"Sabre-tooth Tiger\\" as was common at that time even though the generally accepted term is now saber- toothed cat in recognition of the fact that tigers are not phylogenetically related to saber-toothed cats. Brown believed he had discovered two distinct genera of saber-toothed cats which he named Smilodontopsis troglodytes and Smilodontopsis conardi. It was not generally settled until 1984 that the Conard Fissure saber-tooths were not actually independent genera but rather standard examples of the genus Smilodon, now considered the standard genus of North American saber-toothed cat.C.S. Churcher, The Status of Smilodontopsis...,Royal Ontario Museum Life Sciences Contributions, 30 June 1984. Notably absent from the specimens was any species of mastodon which stands to reason given that the structure of the fissure was such that creatures possibly entered through a sink hole in the roof that was too small for mammals of that size.

His breeder, Lord Egremont, won the Derby for the fourth time with Election. Election raced until he was seven years old and was bought by the Prince Regent after his racing career. He was a successful sire for the Prince's Hampton Court Stud, producing the 1821 Derby winner Gustavus, the 1817 2,000 Guineas Stakes winner Manfred and 1825 1,000 Guineas Stakes winner Tontine. Background Election, described as \\"one of the smallest and most delicate\\" of his sire's offspring, was foaled in 1804 at Lord Egremont's estate Petworth House. His dam, Chestnut Skim, was bred by Lord Egremont and produced nine foals between 1802 and 1817. Election was her third foal and one of six sired by Gohanna. Full-siblings to Election include the colt Prodigal and the fillies Bribery and the Gohanna Mare (the grandam of Frederick and Cedric). Election was trained by F. Neale at Newmarket. Racing career =1807: three-year-old season= Election's first and only start as a three- year-old was for the Derby Stakes held on 14 May at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Thirteen horses participated in the running out of the original 38 subscribers to the race. At the start, Mr. Wilson's colt Sir Solomon took the lead and was the pace-setter for much of the race until the final stretch. Sir Solomon was passed by Mr. Lake's colt Coriolanus near the finish with Election \\"immediately after\\" taking the lead and winning the race by a length. The running was described as a \\"very fine race.\\" Sir Solomon finished second and Mr. Lake's colt Coriolanus (also sired by Gohanna) was third. Election was ridden \\"with masterly style\\" by John Arnold of Newmarket, who was an older gentleman, as he died at an \\"advanced age\\" four years later. =1808: four- year-old season= In his first start of 1808, Election won the 60-guinea Ladies' Plate held at Goodwood in May, winning two two-mile heats and beating the colt Epsom. Another horse, an aged gelding named Tom Pipes, also participated but was disqualified after his jockey \\"mistook\\" or ran the wrong course during the first heat of the race. On 22 June at Ascot, Election won the Swinley Stakes, beating Mr. Fermor's colt Stripling with betting odds of 2 to 1 and 5 to 2 against Election. Election won the 100-guinea His Majesty's Plate at Lewes in August, beating Mr. Daly's colt Bob Booty in a set of two- mile heats. Election won the first heat and ran a dead heat with Bob Booty in the final heat. The next day at the same meeting, Election ran against Bob Booty for a second time in the 60-guinea Ladies' Plate, beating him in the four-mile race. At the First October Meeting at Newmarket, Election won the 100-guinea His Majesty's Plate, beating the colts Rambler and Snug. At the Second October Meeting, Election started in the first class of the Oatlands Stakes against five other horses, including the horse Hambletonian. He finished first, with Lord Foley's colt Weaver second and Hambletonian third. In his last start of the season, Election was handed his first defeat at the Houghton meeting in November when Lord Sackville's horse Deceiver beat Election in a mile-long match race. =1809: five-year-old season= In April at the Craven meeting, Election was unplaced in the first class of the Oatlands Stakes, losing to the colt Bacchanal, the filly Nymphina, the horse Sir David and the filly May. A few days later, Election was also unplaced a £50 subscription plate, won by the filly Agnes. Election did not race again until July, when he won the Petworth Stakes at Brighton by beating the mare Nymphina. In his final start of the season, Election won the 100-guinea His Majesty's Plate at Lewes on 27 July, beating the colts Sunbeam and Hippomenes. A few days later, Election walked over for the Ladies Plate due to the injury of jockey Francis Buckle who was supposed to ride the challenging horse Bacchanal. Buckle was seriously injured immediately after running (and winning) a race for hack horses, after his mount Swingbar collided in succession with a carriage and a man on horseback that had mistakenly crossed the track. With no jockey except \\"those over weight\\" to ride Bacchanal, Election was declared the winner. =1810: six-year-old season= In his first start of the season, Election walked over for the Ladies' Plate at Goodwood on 1 June. On 12 June at the Guildford meeting, Election won both heats of the King's Plate \\"cleverly\\" from Mr. Dilly's horse Gnat-Ho!, who carried two extra pounds than Election in both four-mile heats. Election was entered in the £100 Plate at Brighton, which was supposed to be run on Friday, 27 July, but due to \\"one of the greatest storms ever witnessed at Brighton\\" the running was postponed to the following day. Election beat Mr. Ladbroke's horse Guardy who \\"bolted\\" in the four-mile race. On 2 August at Lewes, Election won the 100-guinea King's Plate against the horse Discount, winning both four-mile heats. The next day, Election again was pitted against Mr. Ladbroke's horse Guardy in a 100-guinea sweepstakes race, winning the race after Guardy again \\"bolted\\" in the race. On 4 August, Election walked over for the four-mile, 60-guinea Ladies' Plate. =1811: seven-year-old season= On 1 June at the Guildford meeting, Election walked over for the King's Purse. At Lewes on 1 August, Election lost the 100-guinea King's Plate to the four-year-old colt Wildboy. Election won the first heat \\"with much difficulty,\\" was second in the second heat and was disqualified in the deciding heat due to falling during the running. The next day, Election was second, and last, in the Ladies' Plate to the horse Scorpion who \\"won easy.\\" Stud career Election was retired to stud in 1812 and first stood at the Royal Stud at Hampton-court for a fee of 10 guineas per mare. Election died in June 1821 at Euston Hall of \\"inflammation.\\" He proved to be a successful stallion, with his progeny including the Classic winning colts Manfred (2000 Guineas) and Gustavus (Derby). Four years after his death he was Champion sire in the year that his daughter Tontine won the 1,000 Guineas.

The festival was usually held in late February - early March and has been headlined by notable acts including The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, New Order, The Stone Roses and most recently Drake. Several weeks after the 2015 edition of the festival, Mushroom Group announced their decision to scrap any future editions of the festival, however they offered hope for a new festival to take its place. History The festival began in 2006 as a one-day independent festival at Sydney's Royal Randwick Racecourse. In 2007 it evolved into a massive travelling festival like the Big Day Out and Soundwave which visited Brisbane, Perth, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. In December 2011, Future Entertainment announced that the Future Music Festival would expand out to Asia for the 2012 festival with a show held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia which was headlined by The Chemical Brothers. The Asian leg of the festival has a similarity to the one in Australia with a mixture of local and international acts.

Maestro Moore has been Music Director of the Ambler Symphony Orchestra since 1995, Principal Conductor of the Orchestra Society of Philadelphia since 1997, and Music Director of the Olney Symphony Orchestra in Philadelphia since 2000. He maintains a very active schedule with these organizations, and through guest appearances with orchestras throughout the tri-state area, and in Russia, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. Mr. Moore is the Program Director and a classical music host at WRTI-FM in Philadelphia. Maestro Moore is the ninth Music Director of the orchestra. Co-founder and first conductor Louis Angeloty held the position until 1956 when he was succeeded by Wolfgang Richter. Richter served until 1968 followed by Joseph Primavera, a violist with the Philadelphia Orchestra for many years. In 1978, not yet 21 years of age, Mark Laycock, winner of the Leopold Stokowski Memorial Competition, became the orchestra's conductor. In 1984 Minnesota-born Arne Running, a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music took over the reins. From 1997 through 2003 Dr. Douglas Meyer served as Music Director/Conductor. In 2004 Gabriel Gordon was selected as Music Director/Conductor and led the orchestra through the 2008 season when his relocation to New Mexico caused him to step down. At the beginning of the 2008 season, Yoon Jae Lee -a native to New York and an avid composer, arranger, and conductor- became the music director and led the orchestra through the 2015-2016 season when he stepped down.  Community Outreach and Young Artists Competition  The orchestra also has an active youth outreach program and is engaged with local public schools in encouraging music studies. These student- focused programs have two primary objectives. First, to encourage young instrumentalists to continue to study and practice their craft, and to acknowledge and reward them for doing so. And second, to develop future audiences, by exposing students who are not musicians to the joy of music and enrich their lives for many years. One of the most important community outreach initiatives of the Old York Road Symphony is its annual “Young Artists Competition”, the winners of which then perform with the symphony in the following season's Young Artists Concert. For more than 13 years, the symphony has sponsored this pair of events to showcase the talent of local youthful music students. Consistent with the symphony's Mission Statement, this competition and its associated concert provide an opportunity for students to perform and a forum to help introduce other teens and young adults to classical music and musical instruments. This competition for young musicians in the Delaware Valley is held every spring. Outstanding candidates are identified through an extensive network of relationships and contacts that orchestra members have established over many years with music teachers in both public and private schools, as well as studio music teachers. The teachers not only recommend students for the competition but also encourage them to participate. A panel of three musician judges selects the winner, or winners, who receive a modest cash prize and the opportunity to perform as featured soloists in the following season's Young Artists Concert.Local symphony showcases spectacular young artists, published March 8, 2011, montgomerynews.com The orchestra also provides teaching materials to the music teachers in the schools attended by the winners. The use of these materials in the classroom helps to expose a wide cross-section of students to the music that will be performed by their classmates and, ultimately, to generate more interest in classical music among the younger generation.

Haas was born in Chicago and moved to New York City when he was six years old. He attended New York University Medical School and Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1924, Haas achieved notice when he published a medical paper detailing his use of a banana diet for the treatment of the eight children diagnosed with celiac disease. Haas concluded that bananas enabled the breaking up of starches and the conversion of cane sugar into fruit sugar, which prevented the debilitating diarrhea of celiac disease. Haas’ research led to the development of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, a nutritional regimen that restricted the use of complex carbohydrates (disaccharides and polysaccharides) and eliminated refined sugar, gluten and starch from the diet. During his career, Haas treated over 600 cases of celiac disease. In 1951, he joined his son, Dr. Merrill P. Haas, in publishing the medical textbook The Management of Celiac Disease.

Box counting is a method of gathering data for analyzing complex patterns by breaking a dataset, object, image, etc. into smaller and smaller pieces, typically \\"box\\"-shaped, and analyzing the pieces at each smaller scale. The essence of the process has been compared to zooming in or out using optical or computer based methods to examine how observations of detail change with scale. In box counting, however, rather than changing the magnification or resolution of a lens, the investigator changes the size of the element used to inspect the object or pattern (see Figure 1). Computer based box counting algorithms have been applied to patterns in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional spaces. The technique is usually implemented in software for use on patterns extracted from digital media, although the fundamental method can be used to investigate some patterns physically. The technique arose out of and is used in fractal analysis. It also has application in related fields such as lacunarity and multifractal analysis.  The method  Theoretically, the intent of box counting is to quantify fractal scaling, but from a practical perspective this would require that the scaling be known ahead of time. This can be seen in Figure 1 where choosing boxes of the right relative sizes readily shows how the pattern repeats itself at smaller scales. In fractal analysis, however, the scaling factor is not always known ahead of time, so box counting algorithms attempt to find an optimized way of cutting a pattern up that will reveal the scaling factor. The fundamental method for doing this starts with a set of measuring elements—boxes—consisting of an arbitrary number, called \\\\Epsilon here for convenience, of sizes or calibres, which we will call the set of \\\\epsilons. Then these \\\\epsilon-sized boxes are applied to the pattern and counted. To do this, for each \\\\epsilon in \\\\Epsilon, a measuring element that is typically a 2-dimensional square or 3-dimensional box with side length corresponding to \\\\epsilon is used to scan a pattern or data set (e.g., an image or object) according to a predetermined scanning plan to cover the relevant part of the data set, recording, i.e.,counting, for each step in the scan relevant features captured within the measuring element. Figure 2. The sequence above shows basic steps in extracting a binary contour pattern from an original colour digital image of a neuron. = The data = The relevant features gathered during box counting depend on the subject being investigated and the type of analysis being done. Two well-studied subjects of box counting, for instance, are binary (meaning having only two colours, usually black and white) and gray-scale digital images (i.e., jpegs, tiffs, etc.). Box counting is generally done on patterns extracted from such still images in which case the raw information recorded is typically based on features of pixels such as a predetermined colour value or range of colours or intensities. When box counting is done to determine a fractal dimension known as the box counting dimension, the information recorded is usually either yes or no as to whether or not the box contained any pixels of the predetermined colour or range (i.e., the number of boxes containing relevant pixels at each \\\\epsilon is counted). For other types of analysis, the data sought may be the number of pixels that fall within the measuring box, the range or average values of colours or intensities, the spatial arrangement amongst pixels within each box, or properties such as average speed (e.g., from particle flow). = Scan types = Every box counting algorithm has a scanning plan that describes how the data will be gathered, in essence, how the box will be moved over the space containing the pattern. A variety of scanning strategies has been used in box counting algorithms, where a few basic approaches have been modified in order to address issues such as sampling, analysis methods, etc. thumbleft400pxFigure 2a. Boxes laid over an image as a fixed grid. Figure 2b. Boxes slid over an image in an overlapping pattern. Figure 2c. Boxes laid over an image concentrically focused on each pixel of interest. Figure 3. Retinal vasculature revealed through box counting analysis; colour- coded local connected fractal dimension analysis done with FracLac freeware for biological image analysis. Figure 4. It takes 12 green but 14 yellow boxes to completely cover the black pixels in these identical images. The difference is attributable to the position of the grid, illustrating the importance of grid placement in box counting.  Fixed grid scans  The traditional approach is to scan in a non-overlapping regular grid or lattice pattern. To illustrate, Figure 2a shows the typical pattern used in software that calculates box counting dimensions from patterns extracted into binary digital images of contours such as the fractal contour illustrated in Figure 1 or the classic example of the coastline of Britain often used to explain the method of finding a box counting dimension. The strategy simulates repeatedly laying a square box as though it were part of a grid overlaid on the image, such that the box for each \\\\epsilon never overlaps where it has previously been (see Figure 4). This is done until the entire area of interest has been scanned using each \\\\epsilon and the relevant information has been recorded. When used to find a box counting dimension, the method is modified to find an optimal covering.  Sliding box scans  Another approach that has been used is a sliding box algorithm, in which each box is slid over the image overlapping the previous placement. Figure 2b illustrates the basic pattern of scanning using a sliding box. The fixed grid approach can be seen as a sliding box algorithm with the increments horizontally and vertically equal to \\\\epsilon. Sliding box algorithms are often used for analyzing textures in lacunarity analysis and have also been applied to multifractal analysis.  Subsampling and local dimensions  Box counting may also be used to determine local variation as opposed to global measures describing an entire pattern. Local variation can be assessed after the data have been gathered and analyzed (e.g., some software colour codes areas according to the fractal dimension for each subsample), but a third approach to box counting is to move the box according to some feature related to the pixels of interest. In local connected dimension box counting algorithms, for instance, the box for each \\\\epsilon is centred on each pixel of interest, as illustrated in Figure 2c.  Methodological considerations  The implementation of any box counting algorithm has to specify certain details such as how to determine the actual values in \\\\Epsilon, including the minimum and maximum sizes to use and the method of incrementing between sizes. Many such details reflect practical matters such as the size of a digital image but also technical issues related to the specific analysis that will be performed on the data. Another issue that has received considerable attention is how to approximate the so-called \\"optimal covering\\" for determining box counting dimensions and assessing multifractal scaling. = Edge effects = One known issue in this respect is deciding what constitutes the edge of the useful information in a digital image, as the limits employed in the box counting strategy can affect the data gathered. = Scaling box size = The algorithm has to specify the type of increment to use between box sizes (e.g., linear vs exponential), which can have a profound effect on the results of a scan. = Grid orientation = As Figure 4 illustrates, the overall positioning of the boxes also influences the results of a box count. One approach in this respect is to scan from multiple orientations and use averaged or optimized data. To address various methodological considerations, some software is written so users can specify many such details, and some includes methods such as smoothing the data after the fact to be more amenable to the type of analysis being done.

In Oregon and Washington its range is continuous from the Cascades crest west to the Pacific Coast Ranges and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the Klamath and California Coast Ranges as far south as the Santa Lucia Mountains with a small stand as far south as the Purisima Hills, Santa Barbara County. In the Sierra Nevada it ranges as far south as the Yosemite region. It occurs from near sea level along the coast to in the California Mountains. Further inland, coast Douglas- fir is replaced by Rocky Mountain or interior Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. glauca). Interior Douglas-fir intergrades with coast Douglas-fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia. Description Coast Douglas-fir is the second-tallest conifer in the world (after coast redwood), and the third-tallest of all trees, (after Eucalyptus regnans). Currently, coast Douglas-fir trees or more in height and in diameter are common in old growth stands, and maximum heights of and diameters up to have been documented. The tallest living specimen is the Doerner Fir, (previously known as the Brummit fir), tall, at East Fork Brummit Creek in Coos County, Oregon, the stoutest is the Queets Fir, diameter, in the Queets River valley, Olympic National Park, Washington. Coast Douglas-fir commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,000 years. David Douglas. Note the thin 3 fingered bracts . The bark on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and contains numerous resin blisters. On mature trees, it is thick and corky. The shoots are brown to olive-green, turning gray-brown with age, smooth, though not as smooth as fir shoots, and finely pubescent with short dark hairs. The buds are a very distinctive narrow conic shape, long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to lie in flattish either side of the shoot, needle-like, long, green above with no stomata, and with two whitish stomatal bands below. Unlike the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, coast Douglas-fir foliage has a noticeable sweet fruity- resinous scent, particularly if crushed. The mature female seed cones are pendent, long, broad when closed, opening to broad. They are produced in spring, green at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 6–7 months later. The seeds are long and broad, with a wing. The male (pollen) cones are long, dispersing yellow pollen in spring. In forest conditions, old individuals typically have a narrow, cylindric crown beginning above a branch-free trunk. Self-pruning is generally slow and trees retain their lower limbs for a long period. Young, open-grown trees typically have branches down to near ground level. It often takes 70–80 years for the trunk to be clear to a height of and 100 years to be clear to a height of . Appreciable seed production begins at 20–30 years in open-grown coast Douglas-fir. Seed production is irregular; over a 5-7 year period, stands usually produce one heavy crop, a few light or medium crops, and one crop failure. Even during heavy seed crop years, only about 25 percent of trees in closed stands produce an appreciable number of cones. Each cone contains around 25 to 50 seeds. Seed size varies; average number of cleaned seeds varies from 70-88/g (32,000-40,000 per pound). Seeds from the northern portion of coast Douglas-fir's range tend to be larger than seed from the south. Ecology A young coast Douglas-fir stand in Anacortes Community Forest Lands, Washington The rooting habit of coast Douglas-fir is not particularly deep, with the roots tending to be shallower than those of same-aged Ponderosa pine, sugar pine, or California incense-cedar, though deeper than Sitka spruce. Some roots are commonly found in organic soil layers or near the mineral soil surface. However, Douglas-fir exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites coast Douglas-fir will generate deeper taproots. Douglas-fir snags are abundant in forests older than 100–150 years and provide cavity-nesting habitat for numerous forest birds. Mature or \\"old-growth\\" Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) and the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400 ha ( of old- growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas-fir trees. Nests are located above the ground. The red tree vole's diet consists chiefly of common Douglas-fir needles. A parasitic plant sometimes utilizing P. menziesii is Arceuthobium douglasii Commonly known as Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe. Its seedlings are not a preferred browse of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) and elk (Cervus canadensis), but can be an important food source for these animals during the winter when other preferred forages are lacking. In many areas, coast Douglas- fir needles are a staple in the spring diet of blue grouse (Dendragapus). In the winter, New World porcupines primarily eat the inner bark of young conifers, among which they prefer Douglas-fir. Douglas-fir seeds are an extremely important food for small mammals. Mice, voles, shrews, and chipmunks consumed an estimated 65 percent of a Douglas-fir seed crop following dispersal in western Oregon. The Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii) harvests and caches great quantities of Douglas-fir cones for later use. They also eat mature pollen cones, developing inner bark, terminal shoots, and tender young needles. The seeds are also important in the diets of several seed-eating birds. These include most importantly American sparrows (Emberizidae) - dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), golden-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla) and white-crowned sparrow (Z. leucophrys) - and true finches (Fringillidae) - pine siskin (Carduelis pinus), purple finch (\\"Carpodacus\\" purpureus), and the Douglas-fir red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra neogaea) which is uniquely adapted to foraging for P. menziesii seeds. The coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest, occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Associated trees include western hemlock, Sitka spruce, sugar pine, western white pine, Ponderosa pine, grand fir, coast redwood, western redcedar, California incense-cedar, Lawson's cypress, tanoak, bigleaf maple and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the Umpqua River in Oregon. Shrub associates in the central and northern part of Coast Douglas-fir's range include vine maple (Acer circinatum), salal (Gaultheria shallon), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), Oregon-grape (Mahonia aquifolium), red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium), and salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis). In the drier, southern portion of its range shrub associates include California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), creeping snowberry (Symphoricarpos mollis), western poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.), and manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.). In wet coastal forests, nearly every surface of old-growth coast Douglas-fir is covered by epiphytic mosses and lichens. Forest succession The Red Creek Fir, ca.15 km from Port Renfrew, BC, measures 43.7ft around its base and stretches 242 ft high The shade-intolerance of Douglas-fir plays a large role in the forest succession of lowland old growth forest communities of the Pacific Northwest. While mature stands of lowland old-growth forest contain many western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) seedlings, and some western redcedar (Thuja plicata) seedlings, Douglas-fir dominated stands contain almost no Douglas-fir seedlings. This seeming contradiction occurs because Douglas-firs are intolerant of deep shade and rarely survive for long within the shaded understory. When a tree dies in a mature forest the canopy opens up and sunlight becomes available as a source of energy for new growth. The shade-tolerant western hemlock and western redcedar seedlings that establish beneath the canopy have a head-start on other seedlings. This competitive advantage allows western hemlock to rapidly fill the canopy gap, pre-empting other species that may invade, including Douglas-fir. Long-term forest dynamics plots show that the annual mortality of large Douglas-fir is only about 1%. Thus, over centuries, western hemlock and western redcedar will come to dominate the canopy. Douglas-fir is a seral species in the wet forests of western British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. In these areas it requires a large disturbance, such as fire or a large landslide, to open the forest and expose mineral soil where its seedlings prefer to establish. It has a faster growth rate than most other trees, giving the Douglas-fir a competitive advantage when it overtops slower growing species during re- establishment of the canopy. The tree ring ages of dominant Douglas-fir trees can indicate the date of the last stand-replacing fire. Because Douglas-fir is long-lived, it can remain dominant in the forest for more than 300-years following the last fire. A history of fluctuating climate resulted in synchronous fire episodes across western Washington and Oregon, thus many Douglas-fir stands date to a warm-dry periods in the late 1400s and early 1500s, while few date to a cool-wet period from 1650 to 1800. Douglas-fir is also particularly well adapted to fires: once they reach around 100 years in age they have thick enough bark that protects the cambium layer of the tree from heat damage. Large Douglas-fir often survive low intensity forest fires. Such sites, common in western Oregon, have two or three cohorts of Douglas- fir, adding to the complexity of the old-growth forest. Fire is increasingly rare northward towards the central coast of British Columbia where Douglas-fir is a minor component of the forest. The logging practices of the last 200 years created artificial disturbances that allowed Douglas-fir to thrive. The Douglas-fir's useful wood and its quick growth make it the crop of choice for many timber companies, which typically replant a clear-cut area with Douglas- fir seedlings. The high-light conditions that exist within a clear-cut also naturally favor the regeneration of Douglas-fir, though in wet coastal climates alders and shrubs compete with Douglas-fir seedlings. Because of clear-cut logging, almost all of the forests west of the Cascade Range not strictly set aside for protection are today dominated by Douglas-fir, while the normally dominant climax species, such as western hemlock and western redcedar are less common. On drier sites in California, where Douglas-fir behaves as a climax species in the absence of fire, Douglas-fir has become somewhat invasive following fire suppression practices of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; it is becoming a dominant species in many oak woodlands, in which it was previously a minor component. Uses Tree rings and heartwood Coast Douglas-fir is one of the world's best timber producers and yields more timber than any other tree in North America. The wood is used for dimensional lumber, timbers, pilings, and plywood. Creosote treated pilings and decking are used in marine structures. The wood is also made into railroad ties, mine timbers, house logs, posts and poles, flooring, pulp, and furniture. Coast Douglas-fir is used extensively in landscaping. It is planted as a specimen tree or in mass screenings. It is also a popular Christmas tree. Largest trees , coast Douglas fir was the second-tallest conifer in the world (after coast redwood). Extant coast Douglas fir trees or more in height and in diameter are common in old growth stands, and maximum heights of and diameters up to have been documented. The tallest living specimen is the \\"Doerner Fir\\", previously known as the Brummit Fir, tall, at East Fork Brummit Creek in Coos County, Oregon, the stoutest is the \\"Queets Fir\\", in diameter, in the Queets River valley of Olympic National Park in Washington. The largest at is the Red Creek fir in British Columbia, Canada. Douglas firs commonly live more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,000 years. The tallest well-documented conifer was , the Mineral Tree (Mineral, Washington), a coast Douglas fir, measured in 1924 by Dr. Richard E. McArdle, former chief of the U.S. Forest Service. The volume of that tree was . Research suggests Douglas fir could grow to a maximum height of between , at which point water supply would fail. Unconfirmed reports of even taller individuals may be found in historic records. *A tree cut down on the Alfred Nye property in 1902 in Lynn Valley on the north shore of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia was reported to have measured in height, and in diameter, and another tree felled in the same valley was said to have measured tall. *The Nooksack Giant, a Douglas-fir felled in 1897 at Loop's Ranch in Whatcom County, Washington reportedly measured in height, in circumference at the butt, and to the first branch. With a volume of 96,345 marketable board feet (227 m3), this tree was estimated to be 480 years old. The tallest tree in the United Kingdom is a coast Douglas-fir.

It connects Innsbruck via Seefeld (both in Tyrol, Austria) and Mittenwald to Garmisch- Partenkirchen (both in Bavaria, Germany). The Mittenwald railway was built as an electric local railway from 1910 to 1912 by the engineers and contractors Josef Riehl and Wilhelm Carl von Doderer. The route was opened on 28 October 1912 and operated jointly by the Austrian Federal Railways and the Royal Bavarian State Railways. It was one of the first lines operated with high- tension single-phase AC-powered trains. Thus it had a substantial impact on the development of standards for electric railway operations in Central Europe. Together with the Ausserfern Railway (Ausserfernbahn) it connects the Austrian district of Außerfern (located west of the Fern Pass) with the Tyrol through Germany. Geography Mittenwald Railway crosses the Isar bridge in Scharnitz The Schlossbach bridge of the Mittenwald Railway The Mittenwald railway runs mainly in the south-north direction between several mountain ranges of the Northern Limestone Alps. In the south it runs from the Inn valley from Innsbruck via Hochzirl and past the Zirler Berg mountain to Seefeld; the Mieminger Mountains lie to the west and the Karwendel range lies to the east. From there it runs between the Karwendel range to the east and the Wetterstein range to the west over the Scharnitz pass and the Austria- Germany border to Mittenwald; at the Scharnitz pass it runs for a short distance along the upper reaches of the Isar river. It then bends to the west, running to Garmisch-Partenkirchen between the Wetterstein range to the south and the Ester Mountains to the north. The most remarkable thing about the route of the Mittenwald Railway is the long section with many tunnels along the edge of the Martinswand (Martin’s wall), a rock face between Kranebitten and Hochzirl station, including the passage of the Martinswand Tunnel (1810.23 m) through the rock wall; it is the longest tunnel on the line. Slightly northwest of Hochzirl, the line runs over the southern flank of the Rauenkopf and southwestern flank of the Brunstkopf, crossing the Schlossbach on an elongated hairpin built with bridges and tunnels. Not far southwest of the bend, it passed the Zirl mountain. History Raising of finance for the Austrian section of the Mittenwald Railway, Innsbruck, 1912 The engineer and contractor Josef Riehl had already presented a proposal in the late 1880s to the Austrian ministry of trade and economics (k.k. Ministerium für Handel und Volkswirthschaft) for a route first running east from Innsbruck to Hall and then after a bend back to the west largely in tunnels up to Seefeld. To obtain the concession for this project, it took many years of disputes over the financing of the project, which involved substantial outlays in advance, with no guarantee of a return. When Riehl finally received the approval of the authorities for the construction of the Mittenwald line on the Austro- Hungarian side of the border, he formed a consortium with contractor and engineer, Wilhelm Carl von Doderer for the construction work. The managers of construction were the engineers, Karl Innerebneron, on behalf of Riehl, and August Mayer, on behalf of Doderer. The contract included all matters necessary for the operation of the railway. In addition to the line construction, this included land acquisition, rolling stock, electrical equipment and the power plant. The contract set the fixed price of 24.4017 million krone to be paid to the contractors Riehl and von Doderer, who thus carried all risk of possible cost overruns. In terms of its length, the Mittenwald railway was a very expensive rail project due to its many tunnels. It was planned from the beginning that it would be electrified. To supply the power needed, a hydroelectric power station was constructed on the Ruetz river near Stephansbrücke (Stephen's bridge) in the Stubai valley, with two turbines each delivering 4000 horsepower. As a result of the extension of the line into Bavaria, that section of the line was supplied with power from the Walchensee power station, which was finished by 1924. Despite the difficulties, the section of the Mittenwald railway on the territory of Austria-Hungary was built in the remarkably short time of about two years. The Bavarian section between Garmisch and Mittenwald goes back to a request in 1896 by the council of Mittenwald for Lokalbahn AG of Munich to develop a project for the continuation of the Murnau–Garmisch-Partenkirchen local railway (Localbahn Murnau–Garmisch–Partenkirchen) to Mittenwald. This route was opened on 1 July 1912, however, in contradiction to the plan, it was at first operated with steam locomotives, as neither the power station nor the electric locomotives were ready. On the Austrian side it was electrically operated from 28 October 1912. Operations in Bavaria switched to electric traction on 25 April 1913. During the Second World War, the steep gradient and the short stations prevented much involvement in supplying the military. In 1945, the Mittenwald Railway was judged by the Allies to be strategically important, and a total of six air raids were flown against the Gurglbach Viaduct. The Inn bridge in Innsbruck was also repeatedly the target of air raids. In 1950 during the winter there was an avalanche at the Martinswand siding, during which a locomotive was completely buried. The railway was reopened with the help of French occupation troops. In 1968 the site was made safe from avalanches by the construction of a protective roof. With the holding of the 1976 Winter Olympic Games in Innsbruck and Seefeld, the Mittenwald line was expected to have high loadings and all stations were equipped with colour light signals. Seefeld station was also replaced by a new station. The superstructure was adapted so that locomotives of both Deutsche Bundesbahn and the Austrian Federal Railways (Österreichische Bundesbahnen, ÖBB) could operate on the line. Due to the ample size of its bridges for the time, it was even possible to operate with two locomotives in multiple. Rail operations ran smoothly during the 1976 Olympic Winter Games, just as they did during the 1985 Nordic World Ski Championships in Seefeld. in the 1980s, when many streets in Innsbruck were widened, it was necessary to raise the line where it passes through Innsbruck, especially by building new bridges. Route Track plan and profile The Mittenwald Railway follows a bold route, planned by the pioneering railway engineer, Josef Riehl. The Mittenwald line crosses the Inn on a steel bridge and runs through the city of Innsbruck as an elevated line to the west and north of Innsbruck West station. In March 1910 the first sod was turned at the legendary Martinswand cliff. The abrupt transition from the Inn valley to the Martinswand and the Schlossbach valley presented the biggest challenges. The line crosses the Schlossbach at an altitude of about 60 m above the water level over an iron arch truss bridge with a length of 66 m. The Finstertal Viaduct was built on the karst slope of the Hechenberg (mountain). A hangviadukt (\\"slope viaduct\\", that is a viaduct built on a slope, requiring much higher supports on the down side that on the up side) was built in the Schlossbach graben. The Kaiserstand Viaduct was built beneath the ruins of Fragenstein. The Gurgelbach Viaduct was built near Reith and the Isar Bridge was built near Scharnitz. Many bridges are similar in size to bridges on the Albula Railway. While stone could be used in Switzerland, concrete had to be used in the Tyrol. The tunnels also had to be lined because of the weak rock. Scharnitz in 1912 with new electric Mittenwald Railway The construction of the tunnels in the Martinswand was particularly difficult and a 17 km long high voltage line had to be built from Innsbruck just for the operation of the machinery. Diesel locomotives brought the rock to dumps. The ingress of water stopped the construction work on the western side of the tunnels and an electric pumping plant had to be installed. The barracks on the eastern side had to be built far below the steep edge due to the lack of space. A funicular railway had to be built to transport workers and materials from the Inn to the site. The smallest radius of curvature of the Mittenwald Railway is 200 m. The maximum gradient of 3.8 percent is significantly greater than the 3.1 percent of the Arlberg Railway, or the 2.6 percent of the Brenner Railway. At Innsbruck West station the line branches off from the Arlberg Railway and reaches in Hötting its lowest point of 580 m above sea level. Its highest point on the Seefeld saddle is at 1,184 m above sea level. This difference in altitiudes is achieved over 19.2 km of line. After this the line descends at up to 3.0 percent to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where it connects to the line via Murnau and Weilheim to Munich and to the Außerfern Railway via Reutte to Kempten. Operations =Trains= The Mittenwald railway mainly serves regional and tourist traffic; international long-distance traffic usually uses the Munich–Innsbruck route via Rosenheim and Kufstein (Munich–Rosenheim, Rosenheim–Kufstein and Lower Inn Valley lines). Since the start of the winter timetable in 2010 one or two pairs of Intercity-Express services have operated daily from Berlin via Munich to Innsbruck over the Mittenwald Railway with intermediate stops at Mittenwald and Seefeld. As a result, Seefeld became the highest Intercity-Express stop in Europe. Regionalbahn services operate hourly on the German side, running from Mittenwald to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and on to Munich. Half of these Regionalbahn operate between Innsbruck and Munich via Mittenwald; these services are branded as REX in Austria. On the Austrian side line S5 of Tyrol S-Bahn runs from the border at Scharnitz via Seefeld to Innsbruck every hour.

She was born in Victoria in 1917 and died in 2003. She studied English and music and later became a music teacher. Margaret married Ellis Lawrie who was a senator for Queensland. Margaret Lawrie became interested in a range of social issues in the course of assisting her husband. She was invited by the Queensland Government to travel with Oodgeroo Noonuccal and a Queensland Health worker to Cape York and Torres Strait Island communities to report on children’s health and other issues in these communities. As a result of her work, Margaret developed an interest and association with the Torres Strait Islands and its people. She first visited the area in the early 1960s and spent significant periods of time with each of the different island communities, gathering information and material about the myths, legends, languages, history, art and culture of the regions up until 1973. During her various visits to the area she formed many friendships with the Torres Strait community. Because of her connections to the people she was approached to record some of the local myths and legends before they became lost. At this time she had a close relationship with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies and she undertook extensive recording of various oral histories under the sponsorship of the Institute. She also undertook detailed research into the history and culture of the Torres Strait Islands and people. The State Library of Queensland now holds this collection of information.

History  The Manor of Townhill was granted to Sir William Paulet by Henry VIII in 1536 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The land was mainly used for farming, and became known as Townhill Farm. Townhill Farm became part of the Manor of South Stoneham, but was purchased in 1787 by Nathaniel Middleton, who had made his fortune in the service of the British East India Company. He turned the farmhouse into a private home, and the estate became known as Townhill Park. He enlarged the farmhouse, but a fire resulted in a complete revamp of the property in 1793. Then in 1820 William Hallett bought, and lived in the house for 20 years. The property later passed into the hands of the Gater family, who also owned the nearby Gaters Mill near Mansbridge. In 1897, Townhill Farm was purchased by Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, for his son Louis (who became the second Baron Swaythling in 1911) while the first baron continued to live at South Stoneham House. In 1912, extensive further modiciations were made to the building by architect Leonard Rome Guthrie, who returned after the World War I to add the music room and a boudoir for Lady Swaythling. The gardens at Townhill Park were laid out by Gertrude Jekyll and were noted for their rhododendrons, azaleas and camellias. The estate included an airfield, where Gustav Hamel was observed flying a loop-the-loop in 1913. The Montagu Family lived in Townhill Park until the mid-1940s. The entrance sign for the 1969 school still stands at the end of River Walk The property was sold in 1948. were sold to Southampton Borough Council for housing, and the suburb of Townhill Park came into existence. Meanwhile the house itself and the remaining of land became a school for underprivileged girls, owned and operated by Middlesex County Council. The school closed in 1969 and the building was acquired by Southampton City Council. From 1971, the building was used as a hostel for Merchant Navy cadets, housing 75, until 1984 when the house became a conference centre. In 1994, Townhill Park House was purchased by The Gregg School. The Friends of Townhill Park Gardens was established in 1997 to restore the gardens, which are now open to the public on four days each year. The house, too, is occasionally open for guided tours. The house is a grade II listed building.Southampton City Council: Listed buildings in Southampton Accessed 17 September 2007. Architecture The house is roughly L-shaped, with its outermost faces to the north and west. The original villa of 1795 forms the central portion of the house, including the north elevation, while the west elevation is the Italianate addition from the early 20th century designed by Guthrie. The house has two storeys. The north elevation is stuccoed and has five bays of sash windows, with the central three breaking forward under a pediment with a blank cartouche. On the upper storey of this central section there are blank panels above the windows, which have moulded architraves with keystones. At ground floor level there is an arcade of three arches, again with keystones. All the windows on the north elevation have glazing bars and wooden shutters. The original doors have been replaced with modern ones. The south face is similar to the north, with the differences that there is a sundial set into the pediment and the arches on the ground floor have triple-round heads with Tuscan half columns. As well as the house itself, the stable block is also Grade II listed. The exact date of construction of this building is unknown but estimated to be in the 1830s. It is a two-storey building of colourwashed brick walls and a slate roof. The roof is hipped and has a low pitch. Grounds and gardens The estate today consists of a landscaped park of roughly 12 hectares, but covered 324 hectares in 1948. The park contains a woodland garden and formal gardens close to the house itself, including Italianate gardens designed by Leonard Rome Guthrie from 1912 and planting schemes by Gertrude Jekyll dating from 1912/13. The First Lord Swaythling commissioned Guthrie's design which included significant changes to the house as well as the gardens. An Italianate style was applied to both, with new terraces, a rose garden and tennis lawns being laid out. The woodland dell and arboretum were later additions commissioned by the Second Lord Swaythling after his father's death. Interior The music room that was added after the First World War is now used as a main hall, and retains its original polished walnut panelling.

Race War Kingdoms is mostly text-based with some graphical implementations and does not have high system requirements. Race War Kingdoms is a browser game that requires an internet connection to play. Gameplay Players begin by creating a character of a selected race, resulting in a level 0 character with a basic set of equipment. Players can then begin adventuring and fighting monsters. Players are able to chat while they are playing the game when the player's character reaches level 1. =Kingdoms= Players are able to obtain kingdoms by settling in a location which isn't occupied by anyone else. High level players maintain multiple kingdoms, also called a plex, and gather interest gold by depositing a certain amount of gold into the kingdom. Players can also attack other players kingdoms using a kingdom of their own. =Skills= Skills can range from 0 to 125 and go up randomly, meaning there isn't a skill bar indicating when a character earns another skill. Level advancement depends on the percentage of experience put towards skills. The higher percentage of experience a player has going towards skills, the higher their chance of earning a skill increase. Characters can only train one skill at a time, but they can be proficient in multiple categories. Skills become more difficult to improve as they mature. =Quests= RWK's quests are primarily obtained by going to a specific location, talking to special NPCs, or defeating certain monsters at specific locations. Quest items are designed to enhance the characters, and some of the powerful quest items are also obtainable by purchasing them from Glitchless. However, all quest items are obtainable by playing the game without purchasing them.

She was the first female game designer to be hired by TSR, Inc. Her career at TSR stalled after she wrote a controversial Dungeons & Dragons adventure module that was withdrawn on the eve of publication and subsequently rewritten. Early life Jean Wells was born July 25, 1955 in Jacksonville, Florida to Walton and Ellen Loft Wells. During a college canoe camping trip, she participated in an impromptu session of Dungeons & Dragons. She was fascinated by the game, and once back on campus, she quickly ordered her own set of the rules, and joined a local group called the \\"D&D; Gang of Statesmen Complex\\". After several gaming sessions, she realized that she liked the role of dungeon master more than player. In her words, \\"It gave me an opportunity to use my creativity in an area I already liked, Medieval History and Fantasy.\\" Career at TSR Wells also ordered a subscription of The Dragon from TSR Hobbies, and in the July 1978 issue, she noticed an ad for \\"an alert and talented person [with] design and editorial talent and a good general knowledge of games\\" in TSR's design department. Although she was still at college studying to be an elementary school art teacher, and her only gaming experience was the D&D; she had just started playing, she applied for the position. After some back-and- forth correspondence with Gary Gygax during the fall of 1978, she flew to TSR headquarters in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin in January 1979 for a three-day visit. Despite her lack of experience, Gygax hired her as the first female in the design department. Wells later recalled that, \\"he knew I didn't know how to really write rules... He was hiring my imagination and would teach me the rest.\\" However, Wells had arrived just as TSR was, in her words, \\"exploding\\", and Gygax did not have time to introduce her to the world of game design. As a result, and especially because she was the only woman in the design department, Wells felt out of place. She later described herself as \\"the token female\\". She moved into a nearby house nicknamed the \\"TSR Dorm\\", since all the renters were TSR staffers—she actually took over the bedroom of Larry Elmore, who had just left TSR—and she started to date Skip Williams. Her first work was editing the adventure module S2 White Plume Mountain by Lawrence Schick. In addition, she also contributed interior art for the adventure module Lost Tamaochan, as well as artwork to the fourth printing of the original Monster Manual, including drawings of an eye of the deep, a giant Sumatran rat, and violet fungi. She was the inaugural author of \\"Sage Advice\\", a D&D; advice column that first appeared in The Dragon starting with issue #31 in November 1979. She tried to bring some humor to the column, believing that some of her young readers were taking D&D; too seriously. One such example appeared in her first column, when she was asked how much damage a bow did in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. Her answer was, \\"None. Bows do not do damage, arrows do. However, if you hit someone with a bow, I’d say it would probably do 1-4 points of damage and thereafter render the bow completely useless for firing arrows.\\" She continued to handle the \\"Sage Advice\\" column until issue #39 (July 1980). In 1980, she did the design and layout of Brian Blume's The Rogues Gallery (which included her own D&D; character Ceatitle). She was also the editor of Gary Gygax's module B2 Keep on the Borderlands, her bestselling piece of design work, since it was included in later printings of the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set,Gygax, Gary (1979). The Keep on the Borderlands, TSR, Inc., which sold over one million copies. =Palace of the Silver Princess= After the success of B2 Keep on the Borderlands, Wells was assigned to write an adventure for the \\"B\\" (Basic) series that would teach new players how to play D&D.; She consulted her editor, Ed Sollers, about every detail, and the result was B3 Palace of the Silver Princess. In keeping with the design of the first D&D; module of the \\"B\\" series, B1 In Search of the Unknown by Mike Carr, Wells left several rooms and areas of the module incomplete so that players could customize those areas themselves. As she related, \\"I was trying to show the players that there was more to a 'dungeon' than just the building. I didn't complete the palace, trying to show them this map could be a mini base map for their game. The players could discover the part of the dungeon that had been caved in wasn't any longer and the DM could expand it. I was assuming that they were trying to learn to set up their own world and I was trying to help.\\" During the editorial process, Wells wanted to replace artwork by Erol Otus that had transformed her \\"ubues\\"—new three-headed monsters—into hermaphrodites whose heads were caricatures of TSR staffers and management. However, she was told that the artwork couldn't be replaced without causing unreasonable printing delays. On the day when the cartons of printed modules arrived at TSR headquarters ready for shipping and copies were distributed to staff, someone in TSR's upper management strongly objected to the module. Some sources state that the objectionable content was four pieces of artwork by Erol Otus and Laura Roslof that were too overtly sexual while Frank Mentzer later stated that it was specifically the Otus illustration with the caricatures of TSR executives. Wells herself related that another member of the design department complained to Kevin Blume, and that subsequently she and her editor, Ed Sollers, were called into Kevin Blume's office and asked to explain why a module designed for a younger audience contained S&M.; The end result was that the entire print run of what became known as the \\"orange version\\"—because of its orange cover design—was destroyed, except for a few copies that were saved from the trash pile by TSR employees. The entire module was subsequently rewritten by Tom Moldvay, who changed the plot, replaced all of Wells' new monsters with standard monsters from the Monster Manual, and removed the empty areas. In addition, the four contentious pieces of artwork, as well as many others, were replaced. The new version was then released with a green cover. Following the Silver Princess incident, Wells wanted to write another module, but in her words, \\"nobody would touch my game ideas with a ten-foot pole.\\" When she realized her suggestions for new adventures and games were being ignored and she was only being given secretarial tasks instead of new design work, she left TSR. Life after TSR Wells married another TSR employee, Corey Koebernick, in 1981. When he was laid off by TSR a few months later, they moved to Beloit, Wisconsin, where she would spend the rest of her life. She did not work again, staying at home to raise their two sons. Wells struggled with several serious illnesses for the last thirty years of her life, including hepatitis C. On January 24, 2012, Wells was admitted to hospital, and died early the next morning. Legacy The piece of work Wells was best known for, the orange version of Palace of the Silver Princess, is an extremely rare item, since most copies were destroyed before its release. One copy rated in VF/SW condition was sold at auction in March 2008 for $3050, making it the highest price paid for a single non-unique D&D; module.

On the opposite bank of the Dnister lies the village of Perebykivtsi in Khotyn Raion. The Ukrainian automobile road T-2002 runs through the town.  History  The town of Melnytsia was first mentioned in the 11th century, which was soon destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Rus'. From 1362, the settlement was in the possession of the Koriatovych family. From the end of the 16th century, Lanckoroński magnates ruled the territory. Ever since the 17th century, the settlement was known as Melnytsia-nad-Dnistrom (or Melnytsia-upon-the- Dnister). In 1747, the town was granted Magdeburg rights. Later in that century, the territory changed hands, to be controlled by the Dunin-Borkowski grafs. Since ancient times, windmills were spaced throughout the settlement, a prime location situated on the slopes of the Dnister River, hence the name \\"Melnytsia,\\" or windmill in Ukrainian. In order to distinguish from other settlements named \\"Melnytsia,\\" the ending -Podilska was added in 1940. In 1960, Melnytsia-Podilska was upgraded to that of an urban-type settlement.

Early life Born on 17 April 1957, Zanotti grew up in San Mauro Pascoli, in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy which is located just outside the seaside resort of Rimini; the town and its surrounding area is known for high-end shoe-making tradition. \\"I was always obsessed with shoes,\\" Zanotti said in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar Australia in 2014. \\"I think the first pair I remember were my mother’s. I was only seven or eight and I remember being impressed with the shape of the toe.\\" In the 1980s, Zanotti decided to pursue a career in making women's shoes. His initial foray was as a freelance designer, working his way to recognizable fashion houses. Career By the early 1990s, Zanotti wanted to branch out on his own and create a distinct style of footwear, particularly ornate with oversized crystals and stones usually used in the manufacturing of bijoux jewelry. He acquired the Vicini shoe factory located in his hometown of San Mauro Pascoli and set about recasting the small company. He moved his style team there and implemented new departments specialized in producing heels and ornamental jewels. In 1994, Zanotti traveled to New York City to present his first Giuseppe Zanotti collection to a select group of fashion editors and retailers. Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Barney’s New York were among the first luxury retailers to pick up the collection and remain retailers of the brand today, along with retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, Harrods, Harvey Nichols, among others. The first Giuseppe Zanotti boutique opened in Milan in 2000, followed by additional stores in New York City, Paris, London, Moscow, Hong Kong, Miami, Los Angeles and Saint Tropez. In 2016, Giuseppe Zanotti celebrated the opening of its 100th store, at IFC in Shanghai. Vicini Sp.A., which started as a small manufacturing entity, today counts five company-owned factories specialized in all the phases of luxury shoe making and employees 650 people who help to produce more than 600,000 pairs of shoes annually. Product expansion  Under Zanotti, Vicini introduced a line of leather luxury sneakers, melding street style with couture decorations in 2010. It featured all of Zanotti’s hallmarks, including crystal embroidery, metal hardware and unexpected design contrasts. \\"I compare sneakers to jeans, which are the most incredible form of unisex fashion.\\" Zanotti said in an interview in 2014. \\"They both don't have rules.\\" In late 2010, Zanotti also presented his first jewelry collection.

A monograph of the genus Symphoricarpos. Journal of the Arnold Arboretum 21(2): 201-252 Symphoricarpos oreophilus is a deciduous shrub growing erect or spreading or trailing. Depending on environmental conditions it may reach to in mature height. The fruit is a white drupe containing two nutlets, each of which contains a seed. The plant grows from a rhizome. It reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from the rhizome and by layering, and sexually via seed. Symphoricarpos oreophilus is common in many types of habitat in western North America, and it may dominate some ecosystems, such as sagebrush.Symphoricarpos oreophilus. The Nature Conservancy. It is also an indicator species of certain habitat types where Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), and/or quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) make up the overstory. It grows in all successional stages in pinyon-juniper woodlands. It is usually found in open habitat, as it does not easily tolerate shade. In heavily forested regions it grows in open areas and breaks in the canopy. Many types of animal use this plant for food, especially in the early spring, when it is one of the first plants to bear leaves. Deer, elk, and livestock browse the foliage. Some small mammals use the shrubs for cover. Birds such as the yellow-billed magpie consume the fruits.

Born in Malvern Wells, Worcestershire, England, Moore-Jones and his family emigrated to New Zealand when he was about 17 years old. He soon became a professional artist and worked in both New Zealand and Australia. On the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). He participated in the Gallipoli Campaign initially as a sapper but later as a war artist. During his war service and for a time afterwards following his discharge from the NZEF in 1916 he produced a number of sketches and watercolour paintings of Gallipoli. After leaving the NZEF, he worked as an art teacher and conducted a number of exhibitions and lectures around New Zealand. He died in 1922 as a result of extensive burns while rescuing people from a fire which destroyed the Hamilton Hotel, in the city of Hamilton. Early life Born on 3 February 1868, Horace Jones was one of ten children of David Jones, an engineer by trade, and a school teacher, Sarah Ann . The family lived in Malvern Wells in the county of Worcestershire, England, at the time of his birth. The Jones family emigrated to New Zealand around 1885, settling in Auckland, where Sarah Ann found work at a girls' school on Wellesley Street, in Remuera. Even as a child, Jones expressed an interest in art from an early age, and as a 22-year-old he received formal tuition from Anne Dobson, an art teacher in Auckland. Jones soon began a relationship with Dobson and the two married on 5 September 1891. Art career Following their wedding, the couple moved to Australia to develop their respective careers as artists, settling in Sydney. It was at this time he changed his name to Horace Millichamp Moore-Jones. He soon developed a good reputation for portraiture and semi-allegorical works which were exhibited with the Art Society of New South Wales. Dobson, who had trained for a time at the Royal Academy in London, also enhanced her already well-known profile. With his wife, Moore-Jones also operated an art school but finances were tight. When, Dobson became ill with tuberculosis, many of the couple's possessions were sold to keep make ends meet. In June 1901, Dobson died and this left Moore-Jones to raise a two-year-old daughter, Norma; two other children had died in their infancy. Moore-Jones remarried in 1905, to Florence , with whom he would have three more children. Despite living in Australia, he returned to New Zealand on several occasions. There were a number of exhibitions during this time, and he also executed his first example of war art, a painting of troop ships departing Auckland for South Africa during the Boer War. This work was presented to the Auckland Art Gallery in 1902. In 1908, Moore-Jones moved his family to Auckland and re-established himself as an artist there. To supplement his income he taught art at the girls' school in Remeura where his mother was headmistress. After four years, he went to London and enrolled in an art school there. He then became an artist on the staff of Pearson's Magazine. First World War Moore-Jones, still in England, was 46 years old at the time of the outbreak of the First World War and decided to enlist in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). To do so, he falsified his date of birth and dyed his hair to appear more youthful. As he enlisted while in England, his initial military training was in Salisbury, where the British section of the NZEF was based. In December 1914, he joined up with the main body of the NZEF in Egypt. To his disappointment, as he had hoped to serve in the infantry, Moore-Jones was posted to the New Zealand Engineers, with the rank of sapper (equivalent to private). 'ANZAC Cove [the landing place]', a painting executed in 1915 by Moore-Jones On 25 April 1915, Moore-Jones was among the sapper contingent that landed late in the afternoon on Gallipoli. The sappers were immediately put to work building emplacements for howitzers and machine-guns, digging support trenches upon on the plateau where Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Plugge established his headquarters, and constructing tracks on Walker's Ridge. During this time, Moore-Jones made several sketches of his observations of the battlefield; some of these were later published in New Zealand newspapers. Coming to the attention of senior commanders due to his artistic skills, Moore-Jones was seconded to the ANZAC Printing Section, which was attached to Lieutenant-General William Birdwood's headquarters. Declining an offer of a commission, for he preferred to remain in the ranks, he made several topographical sketches of the terrain that was used for planning of offensive operations. The dangers of his work were well understood, and Birdwood later commented: \\"Many of Moore-Jones' pictures were, I know, done while shells were whistling overhead, and they portray very faithfully the country in which we were operating...\\" In October 1915, he was dispatched to Cairo to supervise the reproduction by the Survey Department of some of his sketches. In November 1915, a wound to Moore-Jones' hand prevented him from continuing with his sketching work and soon afterwards, he was medically evacuated to England. After recovering his health, he commenced work on a series of watercolours based on his Gallipoli sketches. These were exhibited in England in April 1916 and he also had an audience at Buckingham Palace with King George V. His work was well received by the public and press. A selection of ten landscape images was published by the London publisher Hugh Rees in a portfolio that included commentary from General Sir Ian Hamilton, the overall commander at Gallipoli, as well as Major-General Alexander Godley, the commander of the NZEF, and Birdwood. Later in 1916, Moore-Jones was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF due to being medically unfit for active duty. He returned to his family in Auckland and continued creating paintings of the Gallipoli Campaign in between portraiture commissions. As a result of the publicity of his showings in England, there was considerable interest in his Gallipoli work and in November 1916, he gave the first of what proved to be several exhibitions, accompanied by a lecture, of his paintings. From late 1916 to 1917, his Gallipoli paintings were exhibited around New Zealand and it was during this time that he painted his most notable work, 'The Man with the Donkey'. He went on tour with the paintings, giving talks about his experiences at Gallipoli. From February 1917, the proceeds from his lecturing went to the newly formed New Zealand Returned Soldiers' Association (RSA). His tour was well subscribed and proved to be of considerable financial benefit to the RSA. Moore-Jones continued his fund efforts for the RSA into 1918, travelling to many smaller townships to display and lecture about his work at Gallipoli. Moore-Jones himself did not profit from the tour and short of finance, he, on more than one occasion in 1917, offered to sell his war paintings to the New Zealand Government. He believed that they should be exhibited in a national gallery to memorialise the New Zealand effort at Gallipoli. However, the economic situation of the time, together with Prime Minister William Massey's view that no one should profit from the war, meant that Moore-Jones' offers were declined. The following year the paintings were offered to the Auckland Art Gallery which declined to meet Moore-Jones' asking price of £1,500. Eventually Moore-Jones sold his collection, which numbered 70 works, to the Australian Government for £1,500. =The Man with the Donkey= Moore-Jones' watercolour Private Simpson, D.C.M., & his donkey at Anzac During a seminar in Dunedin in 1917 on his war experiences at Gallipoli, Moore-Jones mentioned his recollections of a man who, with the help of a donkey, transported wounded from the hills at Gallipoli to medical posts. An audience member loaned him a photograph, taken by James Jackson who served at Gallipoli with the New Zealand Medical Corps, of a medical orderly transporting a wounded soldier on a donkey. It was from this photograph, now held by the Waikato Museum, that Moore-Jones based his work entitled 'The Man with the Donkey'. Moore-Jones executed several versions of 'The Man with the Donkey', the first of which was completed in Dunedin the evening after he was given the photograph. Two others were painted when he returned to Auckland, and both of these were sent to England so that lithographs could be made. At least of one of these included an inscription: \\"To the memory of our hero comrade 'Murphy' (Simpson) killed May 1915\\". This version is now at the Australian War Memorial, while others hang at the Aigantighe Art Gallery in Timaru and the Christchurch Officers Club. Although at least six versions of the painting are known, all are dated '1915' by the artist rather than with the date of their execution. With only a couple of original versions in private hands, sales have been rare. The most recent was in 2015 when a version sold for almost $500,000. The medical orderly was originally believed, including by Moore- Jones, to be the Australian John Simpson Kirkpatrick, who served in the early stages of the Gallipoli Campaign before being killed by a sniper and who was well known for his use of donkeys to transport wounded soldiers from the front lines. However, by 1937 it became known that the man the subject of the photograph on which the painting was based on was not Simpson but Richard Alexander Henderson, a stretcher-bearer in the New Zealand Medical Corps. Later life On a visit to Hamilton in 1918 to exhibit his work, Moore-Jones was offered a position as an art teacher at Hamilton High School. While his family remained in Auckland, he commuted to Hamilton for the working week, taking a room at the Hamilton Hotel, returning to his home for the weekends. He continued to complete a number of paintings, including further copies of 'The Man with the Donkey'. Early in the morning of 3 April 1922, a fire broke out in the hotel kitchen. Moore-Jones helped to evacuate the guests to a fire escape. Believing a hotel maid to still be inside the burning building, he reentered to try and locate her. Unbeknown to him, the maid was not at the hotel that night. He made his way to another fire escape but received severe burns to his body. Taken to hospital, he died later that day. Survived by his wife and two children, Moore-Jones was buried at Purewa Cemetery in Auckland, along with another victim of the hotel fire. The funeral service was attended by prominent citizens of the city along with Lieutenant Reginald Judson, a Victoria Cross recipient of the war, who represented the New Zealand Military Forces. Legacy Moore-Jones' artwork is exhibited at several major institutions in both New Zealand and Australia, including the Australian War Memorial, Auckland City Art Gallery, and the Waikato Museum. In December 2012, it was announced that Hamilton, where Moore-Jones had died, would rename a central city street from Marlborough Place to Sapper Moore-Jones Place in his honour. On 27 March 2015, a bronze statue of Moore-Jones, was unveiled on Hamilton's Victoria Street facing the old site of the Hamilton Hotel. Sculpted by the official artist of the New Zealand Defence Force, Matt Gauldie, the statue stands high and is mounted on a large block of stone donated by the Turkish Government and sourced from Gallipoli. It depicts the artist in a kneeling pose while performing a sketch on the Gallipoli battlefield. Gauldie has also created small bronze statuettes based on Moore-Jones's most famous work, entitled Henderson and his Donkey.

In 1896, the Yichang Church of Scotland Mission had no full-time women missionaries and when calls for single women in Scotland went unanswered, the mission turned to New Zealand to make their appeal. Mary Emelia Moore and Catherine Graham Fraser both signed up to the mission as school teachers.  China  Moore and Fraser arrived in Yichang by January 1897 and began language training. Both worked tirelessly to advance the education and well-being of Chinese women. Street life belonged to boys and men whereas Chinese girls and women, many of whom had bound feet, were confined to the Chinese home. Both Moore and Fraser saw the benefit of creating a girls’ boarding school whereby girls and young women could receive an education without the social stigma of walking to and from school in public. They also expanded a women's training school by teaching lace making and embroidery. In addition to providing income to Chinese women, these items were sold to parishioners in Scotland and New Zealand and funded a large portion of the women's mission expenses, making much of the work self- sustaining. The Church of Scotland had many foreign missions across the globe competing for funding. Moore had the advantage of leveraging her network in New Zealand for reliable support, which contributed to the success and expansion of the Women's Mission over the years.Polly Shih Brandmeyer, \\"Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch, Vol. 54 (2014), p. 121. New Zealand forged a deeper connection to Yichang when Catherine Graham Fraser's sister, Isabel, visited the mission in 1904. Isabel returned to New Zealand with seeds from the Chinese gooseberry, thereby introducing New Zealand to what was later renamed the Kiwifruit.A. R. Ferguson (2004) 1904—the year that kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) came to New Zealand, New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science, 32:1, 3-27, DOI: 10.1080/01140671.2004.9514276 Yichang was a vibrant treaty port and transportation hub between Upper and Lower Yangtze River trade. Lower river ships would drop passengers and goods in Yichang to await Upper Yangtze River transportation through the Three Gorges, which required different ships and navigational expertise. Captain Samuel Cornell Plant successfully opened the Upper Yangtze River to steamship trade in 1909, creating more river traffic and trade through Yichang. The city population grew exponentially during this surge.Polly Shih Brandmeyer and Stephen Davies, “Girls Interrupted: The Story of Sea Captain’s Adopted Daughters,” South China Morning Post Magazine, July 28, 2013. Throughout Moore's lifetime in China, she witnessed political instability, catastrophic flooding and outbreaks of disease, violence and two wars. She improved as many lives as she could touch during her years of service. After mandatory retirement in 1933, Moore continued to live and volunteer at the mission with her efforts focused on prisoners and the blind. She also helped manage and care for the millions of refugees passing through Yichang towards west China during the Second Sino- Japanese War from 1937 – 1945. Moore fled to Chengdu in 1939 to join her two daughters. At the end of World War II, Moore returned to Yichang to recover what was left of her burnt out mission and to re-open her school. She later traveled to Shanghai and left China permanently in 1948 just ahead of the communist victory during the Chinese Civil War between the communists and the nationalists. Between 1948 and 1950, Moore traveled around the world, making stops in Scotland and New York to see her daughter, Isobel, before returning to New Zealand. Just months after her arrival home to New Zealand, Moore died from tuberculosis at age 82.  Personal life  In 1921, at age 52, Moore became legal guardian and trustee for two young Eurasian girls, Isobel and Clara Qian, who were biological daughters of Sichuan's Commissioner of Foreign Affairs, Qian Weishan, and his English wife, Adela Robina Warburton. Captain Samuel Cornell Plant and his wife, Alice, had first adopted Isobel and Clara Qian but in 1921 when traveling on home leave with the Plants to England, Isobel and Clara were orphaned when both Plants developed pneumonia aboard the ship and died. Mary Emelia Moore became guardian and trustee of a trust fund given to the girls from Captain Plant's estate through the Plant Memorial Fund. Moore raised Isobel and Clara Qian as her own children until her death in 1951. She never married.

Biography =Early life and education= Moore was born in Warkworth, New Zealand, on 14 July 1906, the daughter of Janet Morison and Harry Blomfield Moore. Her father was a local librarian and keen amateur naturalist. She went to primary school at Warkworth and then left home to attend Epsom Girls' Grammar school in Auckland. She won both a Junior and a Senior National Scholarship at Epsom Girls' as well as a University National Scholarship after enrolling as a student at Auckland University College in 1925. Moore graduated MSc with first-class honours in 1929 under the direction of the botanist T. L. Lancaster. Her thesis was on the root parasite Dactylanthus. =Career= Moore at work in 1959 Moore was at first unsuccessful in her attempt to work as a botanist. She applied for but failed to obtain positions at both the University of Canterbury and Victoria University of Wellington. This was in spite of the fact that her botanic research and writing was extremely prolific and praised by eminent botanists such as Dr Leonard Cockayne. She was employed from 1929 to 1938 as a demonstrator in zoology at the University of Auckland. She was awarded the Duffus Lubecki Scholarship annually between 1929 and 1931. This scholarship enabled her to undertake scientific research and she was able to balance this work with her demonstrating commitments. She undertook a series of trips to Mt Moehau at the tip of the Coromandel Peninsula as field work for the Duffus Lubecki Scholarship. She was accompanied on most of these field trips by her close friend and fellow botanist, Lucy Cranwell. The two botanists made a number of field trips into remote parts of the country in order to contribute to information about native flora. The Moehau expeditions were followed in 1930 by a field trip to Maungapohatu, deep in the heart of the Urewera country. Together they wrote important papers on the northern high-peak vegetation of Mt Moehau and Maungapohatu, and on the Hen and Chickens Islands. In May 1935 the two botanists began a 10-month trip to Britain and Europe, where they attended botanical congresses in London and Amsterdam. Moore had the opportunity to work briefly at Kristineberg and Plymouth marine biological stations, and to demonstrate zoology at University College London. Upon their return to New Zealand they continued their field work together. Moore and Cranwell also produced zoological research, writing a highly original and influential joint paper on the intertidal zonation of the Poor Knights Islands that was published in 1938. In 1938 Moore obtained a position in the botany division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). She was given responsibility for lower plants, and also assigned to work on weeds. This led to an important paper on the pasture invasion and life history of the hard fern Paesia, published in 1942. During the Second World War, she developed a project involving the extraction of agar from seaweed, in order to grow cultures for bacteria. Japan had previously been the world supplier of agar. In later years Moore was to remain an algologist, working with the botanical artist Nancy M. Adams to produce the widely read Plants of the New Zealand coast in 1963. After the war Moore changed her research field to the tussock-lands of Molesworth, in Marlborough. She published on the invasive scabweed Raoulia in 1953, on Rumex-dominated communities in 1954, and in 1955 and 1956 on introduced grass and tussock establishment. At the International Botanical Congress at Stockholm in 1950 she spoke on both Raoulia ecology and Sphacelaria, a small brown alga. In 1953 Moore began worked with Dr Harry Allan on Volume I of the Flora of New Zealand. Allan's death in 1957 left her with editorial responsibility for the whole project. She produced Volume II of the series with Dr Elizabeth Edgar. In 1960 Moore moved to the botany division of the DSIR at Lincoln. The shift coincided with the start of work on the second volume of the series. This work prompted Moore to write separate papers on asteliads, Bulbinella, Libertia and orchids. Published in 1970, Volume II of Flora of New Zealand was hailed for its thorough scholarship. =Retirement= Although Moore retired in 1971 she remained active at Lincoln until 1980. The final grassland ecology bulletin, The changing vegetation of Molesworth station, New Zealand, 1944 to 1971, appeared in 1976, and in 1978 she produced The Oxford Book of New Zealand Plants with J. B. Irwin as botanical illustrator. She returned to Warkworth in 1980. In 1985 she gave a lecture to the Auckland Botanical Society looking back on the work she and Cranwell did in the 1920s. In 1986 she gave another lecture, the inaugural Lucy Cranwell Lecture to the Auckland Botanical Society. =Death= Moore died on 9 June 1987 at her Orewa rest home. Published works Along with the above-mentioned books, Moore published numerous scientific papers on a range of subjects including marine and terrestrial ecology, the taxonomy of flowering plants, seaweeds and barnacles, plant geography, flower biology, carpology and the history of New Zealand botany. Honours and awards Lucy Moore Memorial Park In 1945, Moore was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 Queen's Birthday Honours, and in 1963 the University of Canterbury gave her its DSc for her Hebe research. A fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand from 1947, she was awarded its Hutton Memorial Medal in 1965. In the same year she delivered the Leonard Cockayne Memorial Lecture. In 1974 she was awarded the Sir Ernest Marsden Medal for Service to Science by the New Zealand Association of Scientists. Moore also established the Allan Mere Award in honour of Harry Allan which is now presented by the New Zealand Botanical Society to outstanding botanists in acknowledgement of their significant contribution to botany in New Zealand. The Mere that Moore donated for the prize is housed at the Allan Herbarium at Landcare Research, Lincoln. The New Zealand native grass species Festuca luciarum is named after Moore and her fellow botanist Lucy Cranwell.

Moore was born in Billown, Isle of Man on 12 October 1812. In about 1830, he emigrated to Tasmania with his friend Robert Kermode and then worked on Mona Vale Station in Tasmania owned by William Kermode (Robert's father). Moore married Anne Kermode, the owner's daughter. He was later the owner of Glenmark Station north of Waipara, which for a time was New Zealand's largest sheep run. Moore went to New Zealand in 1853 to prospect for land. With funds put up by Robert Kermode, he purchased large landholdings in North Canterbury (including Glenmark). Upon his return to Tasmania, a company was set up under the name Moore and Kermode, with Moore to be the manager and William Moore (his son), Robert Kermode, and Dr John Lillie. The partnership also bought land in mid-Canterbury (Wakanui, Rokeby, and Longbeach) in the Ashburton District, but this had been sold again by the mid-1870s. Heritage New Zealand has four separate listings on Glenmark Station. Moore had a mansion constructed for him, which took seven years to build. It was finished in 1888, but burned out on 23 January 1891. The two- storey house had cost around £15,000 to build and the furniture was valued at around ₤10,000; there was no insurance. The ruins have a Category II classification. The horse stables, built of concrete in ca. 1881 for up to 50 horses, gave expression to his wealth. The stables are of considerable technological importance (due to the early use of concrete) and have a Category I listing. The Glenmark Station Lodge is listed as a Category II building and still in use. The Station Manager's House is disused these days and registered as Category II.

Early life and California George Fairweather Moonlight was born in 1832 in Glenbervie in Kincardineshire, Scotland. He was the son of James Moonlight, an agricultural labourer, and his wife Jane (nee Lindsay). He never received a formal education; rather, from about the age of nine until he was old enough to go to sea he worked on local herring boats. In 1848, at the age of 16, while engaged on a trading ship off the west coast of America, he jumped ship along with the rest of the crew and joined the Californian gold rush. His six years spent working in California and possibly Virginia were obviously formative ones. For the rest of his life he spoke with an American accent, used American phrases, and typically dressed in the style of a Californian digger: a Crimean shirt, knee breeches, Wellington boots and a bright coloured sash. He was described as having a splendid physique, being almost six foot tall and weighing 185 pounds, all of which was bone and muscle. Victoria and Otago In 1854 Moonlight arrived in Sydney, where he met Jack Tarran, who would become his lifelong friend. Together they went to Victorian goldfields, working at the Bunyong diggings near Ballarat, and in 1855 at Fiery Creek, staying there and in the neighbouring diggings for several years. Moonlight gained a reputation as a prospector among the Victorian miners. While scouting or testing new ground he had to keep very quiet about his movements, or men would follow him in the hope of joining a new rush. At some point he returned to shipwork, sailing to Java, but he soon returned to Australia, where he again teamed up with Jack Tarran. Also his cousin Tom Moonlight joined them. They settled down at the Victorian diggings until the Otago gold rush in New Zealand broke out in 1861. Arriving in Otago they likely joined the rush to the Tuapeka, which attracted a large Australian population during the final months of 1861. By September 1862 they had joined the Dunstan rush on the Clutha River. Here Moonlight met his old friend William Dunnet Sutherland, whom he knew from California and Victoria. Sutherland had also spent nine years gold mining on the Fraser River in British Columbia. Given the resemblance of Central Otago to British Columbia, Sutherland was convinced they should venture further west and test some of the streams that ran into the inland lakes. Moonlight and his party joined him, but as they travelled over the ranges they met their friend the renowned prospector Bill Fox, who told them that he had discovered a goldfield on the Arrow River. The Moonlight-Sutherland party stopped there for awhile, but convinced they could do better, they headed towards what they later learned was Lake Wakatipu, and discovered a river above it which was later called the Shotover. Other prospectors were in the area and there was a rush to the Shotover. Moonlight meanwhile went over a big hill and discovered gold on what was then called Moonlight Creek, a tributary of the Shotover, and Sutherland settled down on the main stream to mine a bar which would later be named Sutherland’s Beach. In January 1863 the Otago Daily Times reported, \\"The population during the past week have been steadily migrating Westward, on the track of a man who goes by the name of ‘Moonlight;’ and a great deal of auriferous country has been discovered, causing a rush from the older workings on the Arrow and Shotover Rivers, but principally from the former.\\" In February the Lake Diggings reporter for the Southland Times wrote, \\"A friend of mine has penetrated with three others within six miles of the west coast. They met Moonlight and Whisky Tom engaged in prospecting about 20 miles from the coast, but they did not seem inclined to venture further, as they had been out for some length of time, and were getting short of provisions.\\" Nelson and Marlborough More interested in discovering new ground than settling down to work a claim, Moonlight left Otago to explore the auriferous ground in the hinterland of Nelson Province. He arrived there in May 1863 without his mates, but Jack Tarran would likely have joined him shortly afterwards. Tom Moonlight remained in Otago, but eventually settled in the Nelson area. After arriving in Nelson, George Moonlight followed the partially formed road to the Buller, and then set out into the wilderness where he discovered a new route from the headwaters of Mangles to the Maruia River (via the headwaters of the Matakitaki and its large tributary the Glenroy), which greatly reduced the distance when travelling from the Buller to the Grey Valley and West Coast. He named two tributaries of the Maruia the Rappahannock and Shenandoah, after rivers in Virginia. In July 1863 a party of four prospectors discovered payable gold on the Mangles, causing a rush to the area. Prospectors ventured out from the Mangles to Matakitaki, and in November two men sent out by the Nelson Provincial Government to investigate Moonlight’s route, came across him and his party working ground in the upper Matakitaki. In April 1864, gold was discovered in the Province of Marlborough on a tributary of the Pelorus River called the Wakamarina. When word of the rich bonanza claims reached Otago, thousands of men relocated north. Moonlight and his mates John Bailie and Jack Tarran on the Matakitaki did exactly the same. In May a reporter from the Wakamarina wrote, \\"Moonlight and party have started, with nine days’ provisions, to thoroughly prospect the Pelorus river, and I quite look forward to hearing of their successfully opening a large addition to this gold-field.\\" They were joined at the Wakamarina by William Henry Phillips, who knew them from Victoria, and they did fairly well, but a few months later, hearing of gold being discovered on the West Coast, they went by steamer to the Grey. The West Coast and Marriage Elizabeth Moonlight Moonlight and party tried their luck at Greenstone Creek and several other diggings, without much profit. About three miles north of the Hokitika River they followed a creek through the bush, and prospected for three months without success. It was very disappointing, especially because they had been on good gold at the Wakamarina. They planted their tools, Moonlight carved his name on a tree, and they headed out. As they emerged from the bush they saw that a large town had materialised on the Hokitika River. They were wet and short of clothes, but had plenty of money, about £800 between them, so they paid a passer by to buy new clothes for them, and went back to Nelson. Upon his return to Nelson, Moonlight married Elizabeth Gaukrodger on the 28th February 1865 at St John’s Church in the township of Wakefield in Waimea South. She was 26, a native of Halifax, Yorkshire, and he was 33. Her parents were Charles and Mary Gaukrodger, proprietors of an accommodation house near Wakefield at Foxhill. Presumably they had gotten to know each other when Moonlight came out for provisions during his previous year’s prospecting in the Matakitaki. After marrying Elizabeth, George Moonlight set off again for the West Coast goldfields. He tramped overland with Jack Tarran, prospecting in the Grey Valley as they went. The first payable gold had been discovered in the Grey Valley at Blackball Creek in November 1864. A small rush had taken place in January 1865, and though miners did well, the better diggings at the Waimea and Kaniere rivers near Hokitika meant there was no major movement northwards. In March or April 1865, Moonlight apparently crossed over from the coastal side of the Paparoa Range, down a gully on the slopes of the Grey watershed, where he discovered a rich wash. News reached Hokitika in mid June and about 300 men set off for the new diggings at Moonlight Creek. Several weeks later a number of other discoveries were made on tributaries of the Grey, so that during July it was rushed by thousands of diggers. Moonlight township was built at the base of the gully and the diggings became one of the most important of the Southwest Nelson Goldfield, but Moonlight himself soon moved on to other prospects. In September 1865, along with Tarran and five other men, he went up the Grey River in a boat laden with provisions. The rumour was that they had gone to test some ground they had discovered on their way overland from Nelson. Two and a half weeks later they returned to register a prospector’s claim in a creek they named the Tarran, which ran into the Mawhera-iti (Little Grey) River about four miles above its junction with the Grey. Moonlight left his name off the prospector’s claim because he didn’t believe the diggings would hold a large population and he didn’t want to attract too many people there. Richmond and the Upper Buller The White Hart Hotel in Richmond By March 1866 Moonlight had returned north, and in April he began conducting a coaching business between Nelson and the White Hart Hotel in Richmond, for which he held the lease. In November 1866, at the White Hart, Elizabeth Moonlight gave birth to a daughter named Elizabeth, and in March 1868 she gave birth to a son named John. In July 1869 they sold by auction all of their household furniture at the White Hart, as well as a four stall stable and a coach house, together with several serviceable horses. Moonlight also advertised for sale the unexpired term of lease on the hotel. During the second half of 1869 he returned to the Upper Buller, where with the help of Tarran he built an accommodation house at the junction of the Warwick and Maruia rivers. Elizabeth arrived in 1870 with the children. They kept a store at the Upper Maruia, and also opened one at the junction of the Matakitaki and Glenroy. In 1875, their Upper Maruia establishment was described as being very complete, and including a large dairy station. The Moonlight family lived at the junction of the Warwick from 1870 to 1876. Periodically, George spent 3-4 days bringing in supplies on packhorses from Nelson over the South Buller Road (as the route he had discovered was now called, connecting Nelson to the Grey Valley) while Elizabeth managed their store. In 1876, with the completion of the North Buller Road, they moved to Hampden , where they built a house, store and warehouse. The North Buller Road connected Nelson to the Lyell goldfield and Westport by following the Buller river itself, with a branch road up the Matakitaki to the Glenroy. Hampden, at the mouth of the Matakitaki, was a stopping place along the way, and so the Moonlights hoped to tap into this new lucrative trade as well as have a better way to supply their stores at the Glenroy and the Upper Maruia. They also advertised as wine and spirits merchants. In early 1878 the Moonlights bought the Commercial Hotel in Hampden for £900. Most of the buildings of Hampden were situated on the low lying land at the junction of the Buller and Matakitaki. In May 1878 heavy rains brought a terrible flood, where the streams of the Matakitaki and Buller cut into the land on which the township was built. The flood carried away the Moonlights’ stabling, almost completely demolished their house, and the Commercial Hotel was damaged beyond repair. George rebuilt it away from the river, up in the bush on what would become the future site of Murchison (renamed from Hampden in 1883), but the rebuild cost him dearly. The fenced complex included a larger Commercial Hotel as well as a smithy, butchery and store. There was much felling and stumping of trees to be done. He also had to replenish his stocks, his carting equipment, and rebuild his stables. Bankruptcy and Death The above monument was placed at the graves of George and Elizabeth Moonlight in 1885. It reads: \\"This monument was erected by the friends of the deceased in testimony of their unwearying energy, perseverance, and self-sacrifice exhibited during the greater part of their lives in developing the gold-mining industry in this Provincial District of Nelson, and in the pursuit of which George Moonlight died.\\" At the end of April 1882 Elizabeth Moonlight caught typhoid. She went to Nelson for medical help, but died two weeks later. She was 44 years old. In May 1883, George Moonlight went into liquidation. Though his businesses appeared to be doing well he had accumulated too many bad debts, staking miners who either could not pay or who had left the district. Also his finances had never recovered from the flood damages of 1878, and he had generally over invested in buildings and leases on land. A great auction was held at Hampden, after which all that remained of his estate was the store and buildings at the Glenroy. With his creditors satisfied, he was discharged from bankruptcy at the Westport District Court in September. In July 1884, Moonlight went prospecting with his old friend John Bailie in the ranges between the Buller and the Upper Motupiko Valley. Although they camped together, they would set out each day to prospect alone. One evening, after talking about going home, Moonlight failed to return to camp. Thinking that he might have simply left, it took two weeks for Bailie to raise the alarm. The body was discovered after a nine day search by a party which included Jack Tarran and George’s son John Moonlight. The coroner at the inquest was William Henry Phillips, who like John Bailie now resided nearby in the Upper Motueka district. Whereas John Bailie was a gold miner, Henry Phillips was a farmer who had been involved in local politics as a member of the Upper Motueka Road Board, then a member of the Waimea County Council. The evidence of the inquest showed that Moonlight had been discovered curled up, about five feet away from a makeshift walking stick, and had died from exposure. The verdict of the jury was \\"Found Dead\\". He was 55 years old. Jack Tarran died five years later at the age of 60. He was lying in bed in his hut on the Maruia when a tree crashed through the roof and pinned both his legs. He lay there for five days without food or drink before he was discovered. Local miners carried him by stretcher 40 miles over the saddle to the dray road at Murchison. A telegram had been sent, so a horse and buggy were ready to receive him and take him 80 miles to Nelson. He died of his wounds two days later following the amputation of his legs. He left behind an estate which was valued at less than £20.

In the mid-1930s, Moody moved to Christchurch and became head of advertising for the central city department store Ballantynes. There she met other artists such as Rita Angus and Louise Henderson, and took lessons in etching from Dorothy Turner. In 1941, Moody joined the British YWCA War Service and worked closely with the director of welfare for the Far East, fellow New Zealander Jean Begg. Moody spent seven years in England, Egypt, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and India setting up residential, recreation and welfare clubs for servicewomen. In 1946 she worked in Japan to open clubs for women of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, including a Muriel Wilson hostel. After a year in Sydney, Australia, receiving treatment for tuberculosis, Moody returned to New Zealand and married public servant Clive Robert Moody, known as Bob Moody, in 1949. They settled in Days Bay, near Wellington, where Moody set up kilns and began to specialise in pottery. In the 1950s she attended ceramics classes at the Petone technical college with Wilf Wright, June Black, Mary Hardwick-Smith, Lee Thompson, Roy Cowan and Juliet Peter. Moody died on 24 December 1991 at Lower Hutt Hospital. Her works of art are held in various private collections in New Zealand, Britain, Switzerland and the United States, as well as in several New Zealand galleries and institutions such as the Dowse Art Museum and the Suter Art Gallery. In addition, a stylised cross of ceramic tiles constructed by Moody is displayed on an exterior wall of the Barber Memorial Chapel at Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Karori, Wellington. In 2015, some of her pottery was included in the 50th anniversary exhibition of New Zealand Potters, entitled \\"Flora Christeller & Friends - A Retrospective Exhibition\\".  Works of art  Moody's ceramics show an interest in Picasso, and are typically based on the human body, birds, animals or mythical creatures. Her human forms often represent the movements and bodies of Middle Eastern and Asian people, possibly a result of her years spent in those parts of the world during the war. Not only did she spend time observing the local people, but she also studied art with local experts, such as an Egyptian sculptor while stationed in that country. Moody explored ceramics as an alternate way to produce sculpture, as opposed to metals casting which was a challenging medium considering the available resources at the time. “She and June Black were the only two ceramicists in Wellington who were working consistently in sculpture during the early years of pottery, and most techniques, particularly with larger pieces, she had had to invent for herself. She builds her figures round a series of steel rods or armatures which are removed when the clay is able to stand up by itself.” Aside from ceramics, Moody also cast bronze sculptures, and in her later years painted and decorated the pottery of others; just before her death, she also began to experiment with batik methods on silk fabric. Moody's organisational skills led her to the position of the inaugural president of the New Zealand Society of Potters. In addition, in the late 1960s and early 1970s she was an executive member of the New Zealand Crafts Council, and for many years was involved with setting up exhibitions for the Society of Potters, the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts and the Crafts Council. During her lifetime, Moody exhibited with the Auckland Society of Fine Arts, the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, and the New Zealand Society of Potters.

He became a trader and merchant in the Far North District of the country, and was later active in business and civic affairs in Auckland. He was born in London, England in 1807. The Australian merchant and financier Joseph Barrow Montefiore was his cousin. Montefiore left London and arrived in Sydney in 1829. He left Sydney in October 1831, travelling to Tauranga, New Zealand. By 1836, he had established himself as a merchant in Kororareka (present day Russell) in the Far North District. Later that year, he returned to Sydney. In March 1840, one month after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, he returned to Kororareka and again opened a store. In March 1841, he went to Auckland and traded land, settling permanently there soon after and establishing a merchant store. He was a foundation member and supporter of the fledgling Jewish congregation, and with David Nathan secured a grant of land in 1843 on the corner of Karangahape Road and Symonds Street for a Jewish section of the Symonds Street Cemetery, Auckland. He became a shareholder in an Auckland newspaper, and in 1846 was one of the founders of the Auckland Savings Bank. Around 1850, he travelled back to London, but in 1855 returned to Auckland under the persuasion of John Logan Campbell and managed some of Campbell's business interests, also becoming involved in civic affairs in Auckland. John Israel Montefiore eventually returned via Sydney to London, and died in Hampshire on 14 February 1898.

When Moetara was a young man, his uncle Mauwhena (or Mauhena) was the chief of Ngāti Korokoro. In 1819 Moetara had a leadership position under Patuone, Nene and Tuwhare in a fighting expedition of northern tribes that travelled down the west coast of the North Island as far as Wellington. During the expedition two of Moetara's cousins died in Taranaki and it may have been because of this that he took the additional name Motu Tongaporutu, the name of a pa in Taranaki. When European ships started coming to the Hokianga for timber in the 1820s, Ngāti Korokoro under Mauwhena were well placed to profit from supplying them with food. One visiting captain, John Rodolphus Kent, married Moetara's sister, Wharo. Moetara continued to take part in war expeditions in the mid 1820s. By 1827, Moetara was the chief at Pakanae, near Opononi. His cousin Kahi, leader of Te Hikutu, also lived there with about 100 of his subtribe. On 20 March 1834 Moetara participated in a meeting at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands to select a flag for New Zealand. In October 1835, he signed the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand.

It is a double-headed membranophone that is held vertically with one head up, one head down, and played with soft mallets on the top head only. Common sizes of drums are 15, 16, 18, or 20 inch in diameter, with 12, 14, or 16 inch depth. The playing style of the Scottish tenor drum has varied throughout the years, but there is typically a variation of the combination of swings (or flourishes) and rhythmic accompaniment to the Scottish snare drum and the Great Highland Bagpipes. It is similar to the more common marching band style tenor drum. Within Competition During band competitions, under most pipe band organizations, a pipe band is required to have at least one tenor drummer competing with the band.RSPBA RulesBCPA Band Competition Rules Many bands use between 3 and 7 tenor drummers to create variety to the music. During solo competitions, a tenor drummer plays a set that is often either written by themselves, or their instructor. There is no standard to the type of music that is written for the tenor drum, although common styles exist for each region where competitions are held. Most pipe band organizations worldwide require that a solo tenor drummer have both a Great Highland bagpipe player, and a Scottish snare drummer as accompaniment.BCPA Solo Competition Rules Commonly within a competition a tenor drummer would play either a hornpipe and jig set, or a march, strathspey, and reel set. However, the selection also depends on what the competition asks of the competitor to play. Tone The tone of the tenor drum is similar to a bass drum, however it is often higher pitched. Often pipe bands will tune the tenor drums to play different pitches, allowing for more melodic and harmonic accompaniment to the band. The drums are tuned to the drones of the Great Highland bagpipes, and also notes on the chanter (commonly A, E, C chord). Although both heads of the drum are tensioned and tuned equally (to avoid the drum producing overtones when struck), a player only strikes the top head with the mallet. Swings Although not used by all bands, swings are becoming increasingly popular. Tenor drummers using swings are often referred to as 'flourishing tenors.' Swings are done by tying a string to the end of the drum stick, and the fingers of the players. Then the player can \\"drop\\" the drumstick without losing it, and swing it around in a controlled manner. Many flourishing tenor drummers create choreographed sequences within a line of drummers, creating different effects while using the same basic swings. Currently whether tenor drummers should or should not flourish, or how much they should flourish, is a large area of debate. Rhythm The music being played by the tenors often varies greatly between different regions and styles. Some tenors only play rhythm rather than flourishing, either as accent to the bass drum or snare drums, or to create intricate runs that add variation to the band's music. The bands that use tonally tuned tenor drummers also split the music for the tenor drummers, such that one player only plays certain notes, causing a melody to occur within the tenor line. This melody is used to provide a more full sound to the pipe corps or to provide harmonic accompaniment. Although more difficult rhythms are becoming popular among competitive pipe bands and competitive solo tenor drummers, the idea of a basic rhythmic accompaniment from the bass section is still the more popular ideal.

It was released for Windows in April 1997, on iOS and Android on October 9, 2010, for Windows Phone on July 6, 2015, and on Nintendo Switch on October 11, 2017. The game follows a player-controlled video game company and its attempts to expand into a sales powerhouse over time. As a simulation, the game and the direction of the company is controlled by the player, following a parallel timeline of the video game industry and its history. The game was released to positive reviews, with many reviewers focusing on Game Dev Storys addictive aspects and its witty references to video game pop culture.  Gameplay  The menu on the left-hand side of the screen allows the player to control the direction of their game studio, while the bottom menu row shows the sales of their currently released game. The player takes control of a start-up video game developer, with the goal of making hit titles and consoles in order to make money. The user controls a number of factors which can help or hinder the quality of the games released, including hiring staff, controlling the direction and speed of development, and using items which give boosts for workers or change their jobs. As the player progresses and earns more money, their building is improved upon and they are allowed to hire more staff, and thus create better games. Games are assigned review scores upon completion of a game ranging from 1–10 with a comment from the associated reviewer with his score. The scores generally affect the sales that go along with the game, and as they are in real life, sales are ranked with a number according to how they sold that week. When the player reaches the Hall of Fame level, they can hire more staff. To reach the Hall of Fame, the player needs to get the critics to give a score of at least 32.  Development  The original Game Dev Story was released in Japan for Microsoft Windows in April 1997. It was ported in 2010 to both iOS and Android. A Windows Phone port was released in July 2015. It was also later released on Nintendo Switch on October 11, 2017.  Reception  Game Dev Story received positive reviews, praising the addictiveness of its mechanics and its somewhat realistic treatment of video game development. It received an 86/100 on Metacritic. The A.V. Club praised the game's freedom for the player's choice in how they choose to develop their company. Eurogamer Keza MacDonald described Game Dev Story as \\"the best thing I've ever played on the iPhone\\" and praised the game for its unpredictable and addictive simulation gameplay. Ron Gilbert, the original creator of the Monkey Island video game series, told Wired that he was a self-proclaimed addict to the game. Criticism of the game mostly focused on the end-period of the game. Pocket Gamer felt that Game Dev Story slowed down towards the end of the game because it became too easy to churn out successful games at a quick pace.

Early life Mills was born in Wellington, New Zealand on 11 November 1896. Her parents were Thomas, a journalist, and Elizabeth (born Huggins). By 1920 the family had moved to Feilding as her father had purchased the local newspaper. Mills continued her schooling at Feilding District High School. Mills' mother taught her embroidery as a child, and she also had lessons with her art tutor's wife, a graduate of the Royal School of Needlework, London. Later life In the 1920s, Margaret Alcorn and Mary Alcorn hired Mills to design embroidery patterns for their shop on Lambton Quay, Wellington, called \\"Liberty's Wellington\\". Mills had a team of assistants who printed her patterns onto fabric for sale. The Alcorns' shops went into liquidation during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and Mills went into business on her own. She and a friend, Irene Esau, opened a needlework shop in Palmerston North in 1934, and in 1938 Mills returned to Wellington to open a small embroidery shop in Cable Car Lane. The business was successful, providing not only needlework supplies but also lessons. In 1952 Mills sold the lease of her shop and went overseas - firstly to England, where she studied art for two years at Saint Martin's School of Art, London, then to Europe for a year's travelling. While overseas, her art work was exhibited at the Imperial Gallery of Art, the Society of Women's Artists, and the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours. On her return to Wellington, Mills opened a needlework shop and ran it successfully until the early 1970s, when she again gave up business for art. She moved to Blenheim and taught watercolour painting there with a friend, Brenda Narbey. In 1974 the two artists went to Italy on a painting trip, exhibiting their work in Wellington on their return. In 1981 Mills moved to Dannevirke to be nearer family. In 1983, she damaged her right hand in an accident and it was amputated. Nevertheless, she learnt to paint and embroider with her left hand and continued with both interests.

The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) compete for a job. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) has to deal with Cathy's sexual advances in his hotel room. Also, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has everyone stay late to cover for their co-workers in Florida. \\"After Hours\\" received mixed reviews from critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"After Hours\\" was viewed by an estimated 5.02 million viewers and received a 2.6 rating/7% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, marking a 16% rise in the ratings from the series low ratings of the previous episode, \\"Tallahassee\\". The episode also ranked as the highest-rated NBC program of the night. Synopsis Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) compete to become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after work at the hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer seems to be the most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) keep Nellie distracted while Dwight helps Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) with something in his hotel room. Gabe takes it upon himself to spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit on Gabe's pants and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight eventually succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key to his room. Upon kissing her and realizing that what he doing is wrong, Dwight secretly scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval. In Scranton, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has everyone stay late to cover for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives with Jamaican food Andy ordered and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of having an affair with her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Andy each advise Darryl on what Jim would do; while Andy suggest he wait, Pam says that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows Pam's advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) that she is intending to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation to hook up with her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a waffle she unsuccessfully ordered. They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he begrudgingly resorts to saying he loves Kelly. Jim has started spending more time with Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) because Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) keeps trying to rope Jim into having an affair. During the night at the hotel, Cathy asks to hang out for a while in Jim's room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning. She repeatedly makes seductive signals, making Jim uncomfortable. Stanley is no help, so he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off Jim's bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body. This fails to sufficiently disgust Cathy, who merely steps into the bathroom to take a shower until Dwight leaves. Cathy gets out of the shower wearing only a bath robe. After ordering some desserts from room service and asking Jim to touch her legs, he finally comes out saying that he is happily married, and does not want to be with her. Cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever, so Jim relents, but Cathy immediately resumes her seductive technique. After Jim goes to the bathroom, he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket. Fed up, he demands that she leave and lets Dwight, armed with spray chemicals, into the room. Jim claims to see a bed bug near Cathy, making her flee from Dwight's spraying. However, because of the chemicals, Dwight suggests Jim sleep in Cathy's room. Jim instead spends the night with Dwight in his room, eating Cathy's desserts and watching TV, while a drunken Nellie tries unsuccessfully to get in.

It was also the last episode of The Office to be viewed by more than 5 million viewers until the series finale a year later. =Reviews= \\"After Hours\\" received mixed reviews from critics. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall called it the best episode of a \\"disappointing\\" season. He was mainly positive towards the focus of the episode with both story-lines in Tallahassee and Scranton taken place after hours and for the several plot lines in the episode. He praised the pairing of Darryl and Val, saying that they are better matched to be the series' \\"new\\" Jim and Pam than Andy and Erin. Cindy White of IGN said that the episode proved the series was \\"on a hot streak\\". She mainly liked the storylines taking place in Tallahassee and said that the end of the Dwight-Nellie storyline was a \\"nice bit of character development\\". She was also very positive to Baumgarter's directing in the episode, saying he \\"nailed\\" the documentary format of the episode. She went on to slightly criticize the Scranton storyline and wrote that she hoped the writers would wait before putting Val and Darryl together. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Not all reviews were positive. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote that the episode was too crowded and that while all four plotlines had \\"potential\\", they weren't given enough time to develop. Despite this, he did compliment the Dwight scenes, due to their ability to gain a \\"comic rhythm\\". He also complimented the Dwight-Nellie-Todd storyline, saying that his decision to not sleep with Nellie was a \\"nicely human moment\\" and also wrote that the character was more grounded when he was more self- aware. He ultimately gave the episode a C+. Many critics commented on the plot featuring Cathy attempting to seduce Jim. White noted that, \\"Jim did bumble it a bit in the face of Cathy taking insincere offense at his accusation, but the outcome wasn't hard to predict. Of course Jim would stay true to his real soulmate.\\" Sepinwall noted Dwight's cartoonish behavior in the episode, although he called it a good addition to the Jim-Cathy story-line. McNutt wrote that due to the \\"choppy storytelling\\", the Jim-Cathy storyline was not able to feel awkward enough to \\"feel Jim's struggle\\".

Jitendra Haripal, a 2017 Padma Shri awardee, is the male singer of the song. The song was first recorded for All India Radio in the mid-1970s. A record company from the then Calcutta, Indian Record Manufacturing Company Ltd (INRECO), re- recorded the song in 1976. The disc release was delayed due to a dispute and finally released in 1978–79. The Sambalpuri song was written by Mitrabhanu Gauntia, composed by Prabhudatta Pradhan and sung by Jitendra Haripal and Krishna Patel. In the 1970s and 1980s, the song gained popularity for being commonly played in marriage processions and Murti immersion. The song gained official recognition when it was played in the tableau of Odisha as part of the Republic Day celebrations at New Delhi in 2007. The lead singer Jitendra Haripal was also felicitated by Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik later that year. It was also notably used in the celebration of victory during an international cricket match in Barabati Stadium, Cuttack. \\"Rangabati\\" was recreated in many other languages of India and has been recreated in Telugu for a movie. In popular culture \\"Rangabati\\" is popular in Odisha and most parts of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. This song is also to be released in Chinese. During the 7th World Water Forum at Daegu in South Korea, Korean dancers danced ecstatically to the tune of the song. The song is featured in Bollywood movie Kaun Kitne Pani Mein directed by Nila Madhaba Panda. The song was remade by composer Ram Sampath featuring Sampath himself, Sona Mohapatra, and Rituraj Mohanty for MTV India's Coke Studio Season 4.

Earlier on the same day, a legal notice with a damage claim of 1 crore Indian Rupees was sent through the Supreme Court of India to Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages, Viacom18 Media, Sona Mohapatra, Ram Sampath and Rituraj Mohanty for copyright infringement.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120602/jsp/odisha/story_15561051.jsp#.UKdkLmf_m7s The petitioner also requested the court to stop the telecast of this remixed song on MTV.

The other major quartz vein in Kuala Lumpur is along Kajang-Cheras road, which is about 8 km long,http://www.wwf.org.my/about_wwf/what_we_do/forests_main/the_malaysian_rainforest/types_of_forests/klang_gates_quartz_ridge/ however the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge is one-of-its-kind because it has four types of quartz formation. The area has five endemic plants species among 265 species, found nowhere else in the world. A rare animal, the serow is found here as well. Despite being one of the most unusual geological formations in Malaysia, the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge has little conservation and currently being threatened by urban development. More recently, the proposed East Klang Valley Expressway became the latest threat towards the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge, as the expressway alignment may pass through the quartz strip.

It includes the settlements of Sarral and Montbrió de la Marca. Montbrió was originally a separate municipality, but was incorporated into Sarral in 1972. The municipality has an area of 52 km, and a population (in 1995) of 1418. Its elevation is approximately 467m. Economic activity is mainly agricultural, principally vines and wine. Sarral produces its own variety of rosé cava (a sparkling wine). The other major traditional activity is quarrying alabaster and producing alabaster sculptures and craftware. Sarral also hosts Spain's biggest producer of frozen bread and pizzas. The town is ancient, with prehistoric urban remains having been found. It was granted a town charter in 1180. In the 14th century there was a large Jewish colony in the town; a street called Carrer dels Jueus still exists. In 1647 the town was destroyed by Castilian troops.

The longest-serving of any of the daimyō of Sendai Domain, Yoshimura placed the domain back on sound financial footing. Biography Yoshimura was the eldest son of Date Munefusa (the 8th son of Date Tadamune, who had established a cadet branch of the clan. He was born in what is now part of the village of Daitō, Iwate in the northern part of the domain, and his childhood name was Sukesaburo (助三郎). His mother was the daughter of Katakura Kagenaga. He became head of his household on 13 January 1686 on the death of his father, and underwent the genpuku ceremony in December 1690, receiving the name of . In 1693, when the clansmen and senior retainers petitioned Date Tsunamura to retire, his name does not appear on the documents. In March 1695, he was to be adopted as heir by Tamura Tatsuaki of Ichinoseki Domain; however, before official notice could be given to the shogunate, he was adopted by Date Tsunamura as his heir instead. His courtesy title was Echizen-no-kami, and his Court rank was Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. He was received in formal audience by Shōgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi in November 1696 and was given the name of Yoshimura, along with the Court Rank of Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and honorary title of chamberlain. He became daimyō upon Tsunamura’s retirement in 1703, and also inherited the courtesy title of Sakonoe-gon-shōshō (General of the Left Guards) and Mutsu-no-kami. Yoshimura first entered Aoba Castle on 21 May 1704. At the time, the domain was in a state of bankruptcy, caused by Tsunamura's ambitious public works and temple building projects. Determining that one cause of the debt and inflation was the domain's issuance of paper currency, he stopped issuance and began a process of removing these bills from circulation. In September 1706 he took the unprecedented step of informing the shogunate that Date Domain did not have the necessary funds to make its mandatory sankin-kōtai to Edo, and asked for financial assistance. The shogunate agreed to temporarily cut the domain's taxes in half and to accept payment in currency rather than rice. At the time, the domain's debt exceeded 123,000 ryō and continued to snowball due to high interest rates. In 1711, when Date Yoshimura ordered to accompany the Shogunal pilgrimage to Nikkō Tōshō-gū, the domain was forced to borrow an additional 73,700 ryō from moneylenders in Edo and Kyoto. In 1711, his court rank was increased to Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade and his courtesy title to Sakonoe-gon-chūshō. In an effort to overcome the fiscal crisis, the domain conducted a re-survey in 1725, followed by extensive land reform to uncover undeclared rice lands and to bring waste lands back under cultivation. However, these efforts were hampered by poor harvests due to inclement weather, and by the opposition of many landholders. In 1726, the position of Fushin bugyō was abolished, and is 1729 the number of gundai (district governors) was reduced from eight to four, all in an effort the streamline the domain administration and reduce expenses. On the positive side, the shogunate established a mint for copper coinage in Sendai, using locally mined copper, in 1727. The use of currency for transactions corresponding increased within the domain, and the domain also took steps to buy up all surplus rice from farmers and sell in Edo for a profit. It was claimed that most of the rice on sale in Edo in the early 18th century was from Sendai. In 1732, a very severe famine struck the Kansai region of Japan, but Sendai enjoyed a bumper crop that year and was able to ship a very large quantity of rice to the affected areas, making over 500,000 ryō in profits and to wipe out decades of debt at a single stroke. In 1743, Yoshimura retired in favor of his son, Date Munemura, and moved to his villa in Sodegasaki, where he died in 1752. He was posthumously elevated to Senior Third Rank in 1928.

The sculpture was made by Jens Galschiøt and Lars Calmar in 2002, as a symbol of the imbalanced distribution of the world’s resources. In 2006 it was acquired by the city of Ringkøbing, Central Denmark Region, and placed in the harbourhttps://www.tv2fyn.dk/fyn/ringkobing-kober-den-fede-dame Ringkøbing buys The Fat Lady (in Danish). The sculpture in China 2005  Sculpture and symbols  The 3.5 metre tall bronze sculpture was made in 2002 and depicts a huge fat woman from the west, sitting on the shoulders of a starved African boy. The woman is holding a pair of scales, as a symbol of justice, but her eyes are closed—a reference to the traditional depiction of Lady Justice wearing a blindfold, but also a suggestion that justice is degenerating into a self-righteous unwillingness to see an obvious injustice. The sculpture was intended to send out a message to the rich part of the world; it seems to create focus on our obesity due to over consumption while people in the third world are dying of hunger. Due to the imbalanced distribution of the resources in the world, the most people in the western countries are living comfortably, they are oppressing the poor people by means of an unjust world trade. The rich countries are by means of tariff barriers and subsidies keeping the poor countries out of the markets of the West.http://www.aidoh.dk/new-struct/About- Jens-Galschiot/CV.pdf the official CV of Jens Galschiot On the sculpture there is an inscription, which states: \\"I'm sitting on the back of a man. He is sinking under the burden. I would do anything to help him. Except stepping down from his back.\\"  Exhibition at COP15  In 2009 at the 15th Climate Change Conference (COP15), Jens Galschiot exhibited a series of sculptures titled SevenMeters, with Survival of the Fattest among them. Survival of the Fattest was placed in the harbour of Copenhagen, next to the internationally famous statue, The Little Mermaid. Based on a fairy tale by the Danish fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen. The Little Mermaid is a national monument and seen by an estimated 1 million tourists a year. By placing his sculpture in the water next to The Little Mermaid, Galschiot was assured that its explosive message would receive international attention. The act also highlighted that the goals and objectives of the wealthy nations at the Climate Change Conference to be nothing more than fairy tales.http://art-for- a-change.com/blog/2009/12/cop15-survival-of-the-fattest.html an article from art-for-a-change.com As of 2020, the monument is located in the harbour of Ringkøbing, Central Denmark Region.

It is currently housed at Tate Britain. History A very daring composition, this is one of Waterhouse's most unusual, and consequently most striking, oil paintings. The corpse is dramatically foreshortened, and the snow contrasts with that of Eulalia's naked flesh – the 12-year-old girl seems singularly out of place for a Waterhouse picture.P. Trippi, J.W. Waterhouse, Phaidon Press (2005), s.v. \\"St Eulalia\\". His choice of configuration – situating the corpse across the front and leaving so much of the central canvas unoccupied – was risky but it worked: by placing all the background figures in the distance, he concentrated the viewer's gaze on the naked body.A. Noakes, Waterhouse. John William Waterhouse, Chaucer Press (2004), passim The nudity was also groundbreaking for Waterhouse – and something that could have laid him open to criticism – but his sensitive handling of the subject, the youth of the saint, and the historical context of the painting allowed him to escape the critics' pen.Cf. critique at johnwaterhouse.com. The eye is also led to the murdered girl by the angle of the Roman guard's spear, pointing to the ropes that had bound her to the stake. According to legend,See Wiki entry, \\"Saint Eulalia of Mérida\\". Also, she appears in Thieleman J. van Braght, Martyrs Mirror: An account of Those who Suffered in the Fourth Century (1660), see Martyrs Mirror excerpt the snow was believed to have been sent by God as a shroud to cover the saint's nakedness; and the dove, seen flying upwards near the crowd of mourners, indicative of Eulalia's soul flying up to Heaven, was said to have flown out of her mouth.Quoted by Waterhouse in the exhibition catalogue (see Tate's entry).

It was moved from the genus Hypoxylon into the genus Annulohypoxylon erected in 2005 by Hsieh, Ju and Rogers.

Tremella fuciformis is a parasitic yeast that does not form an edible fruitbody without parasitizing another fungus. Annulohypoxylon archeri is its preferred host, so cultivators usually pair cultures of Tremella fuciformis with this species, or others in the former genus Hypoxylon (now spread into two genera – Hypoxylon and Annulohypoxylon).

Early life Anokhelal was born in a very poor family of Kashi (Banaras), now known as Varanasi (State – Uttar Pradesh). Anokhelal learnt tabla under Bhairow Prasad Mishra (Bhairow is also spelled as Bhairav or Bhairon). Bhairow prasad Mishra detected his talent and enrolled him as a student of the Tabla in the Banaras Gharana of Ram Sahaiji at the age of 5 or 6 years. Anokhelal Learnt Tabla for about 15 years from Bhairow Prasad Mishra. Bhairow Prasad Mishra was disciple of Bhagat-ji. Bhagat-ji was disciple of Ram Sahai, the founder of The Banaras- Bāj (aka Banaras Gharana). According to The Banaras Bāj-The Tablā Tradition of a North Indian City by David Roach, Anokhelal was the most famous disciple of Bhairav Prasad Mishra among Maulvi Ram Mishra, Mahavir Bhatt, Mahadev Prasad Mishra, Anokhelal Mishra, and Nageshvar Prasad.[Asian music, Volumes 1–3, Society for Asian Music, JSTOR (Organization), Project Muse, 1968] He lost his parents as teenager. After that he was brought up by his grandmother. As a child, Anokhelal had to suffer poverty and deprivation. Musical journey Anokhelal put in unremitting riyaaz (practice) under the guidance of Guruji (Master), which went on for hours together, every day. =Special abilities= He was called the Jadugarhttp://www.shawnmativetsky.com/benares.html (wizard) of ' Na Dhin Dhin Na ' (theka of Teen Taal- 16beats) and ' Dhere Dhere Kite Taka ' (particular tabla syllables). He used to play these and many more syllables with clarity even at extreme speed.

Anokhelal performed a number of solo concerts during his career and also gave 'Sangat' (accompany) to many famous musicians and classical dancers. Some of them are Ustad Allauddin Khan, Ustad Vilayat Khan, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, etc. Within his short span of life he performed regularly, throughout India.Musicians of India by Amal Das Sharma At a time, when performing in the 'National Programme of Music' on All India Radio was a matter of prestige, Pandit Anokhelal figured in the same, a number of times.

It is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.  History  The work was in the Chamber of Commerce of Florence which leads to the hypothesis that like Botticelli's earlier painting, the Madonna della loggia, it had been commissioned either by the Wool Guild or the Tribunale della Mercanzia. Wilhelm von Bode was the first to date the work to the artist's juvenile phase, in particular to the period of Verrocchio, 1469–1470, which has since been confirmed by other scholars.  Description and style  Verrocchio's Putto con delfino The Virgin Mary, with a pensive attitude, is holding the Christ Child on her knees beneath a loggia with columns supporting a semicircular arch with a coffered ceiling, framing the head of the Virgin and following the curved profile of the board. Behind Mary extends a garden with its pink roses dominating the foreground. Below her is a floor with framed marble tiles which demonstrates the painter's mastery of perspective technique. The roses symbolize one of the titles of Mary, \\"Mystical Rose\\". The pomegranate, which Mary holds in her hand and which the Child is tasting, symbolizes fertility, royalty, and with its red color, the blood of the Passion of Jesus. The work shows incisive use of chiaroscuro reminiscent of Verrocchio, in whose workshop Botticelli may have trained. The same type of child, with a large oval head and joyful lively expression, can be seen in Verrocchio's sculpture Putto con delfino from the same period. The figure of Mary is elongated and loosely posed, much more so than in the works of Filippo Lippi, another of the young Botticelli's models. There are some uncertainties in space such as the disproportion of the architectural background which is too small compared to the figure of Mary and also compared to the flowers in the garden behind her.

The most common example of this is the better minor or short club opening bid. Another example refers to a principle of bidding in bridge popularized by Howard Schenken in bridge columns that he wrote during the 1960s. In his book \\"Big Club\\", Schenken refers to the principle as \\"The Principle of Anticipation (or Preparedness)\\". The principle states that when choosing an opening bid, a player should be prepared for the possibility that his partner could respond in the opener's shortest suit; he should choose his opening bid and have an appropriate rebid ready for that eventuality. The \\"Principle of Preparedness\\" was originally used by Ely Culbertson in the 1930s and is referred to by various writers from that period. Example In the example on the left, South is the dealer and because he holds 14 high card points (HCP), he must open the bidding. If he were to open 1, his longest suit, he will get a 1 response from partner and according to Standard American methods, be obliged to rebid 1NT since a bid of 2 would be a reverse and show a more powerful hand than he has. The partnership could easily be down several tricks in 1NT if the opponents' hearts split adversely and key black cards are in unfavorable positions. Schenken advocates an alternative treatment of this hand and recommends opener begin the auction with 1. Then, when responder replies with the anticipated 1 bid, opener can retreat to 2, which responder, with only 6 HCP, would pass. If responder's diamond holding were stronger, he could correct to 2. The partnership is more likely to make a 2 contract even against adverse defensive holdings.

He was also betrothed to the daughter of Tokugawa Munenao, the daimyō of Kii Domain at that time. He became daimyō in 1743 upon the retirement of his father. He was noted as a man of many talents. As was his father, he was noted for his literary achievements, and he was also proficient in horsemanship, swordsmanship, use of the spear, military strategy and hōjutsu (gunnery). In 1747, Hosokawa Munetaka, daimyō of Kumamoto Domain was cut down by a hatamoto, Itakura Katsukane, while en route to a ceremony at Edo Castle. Katsukane had a vendetta against Itakura Katsukiyo of Annaka Domain, but as the Hosokawa and Itakura family crests are so similar, he killed the wrong man. This placed the Hosokawa clan in danger of attainder, as Munetake was without heir. Date Munemura, who happened to be nearby when the incident occurred, knelt by the corpse of Hosotake Munetake and loudly declared \\"he still lives!\\" and ordered his retainers to take the body to the Hosokawa clan residence before the Shogun's metsuke inspectors could arrive at the scene. This allowed the Hosokawa clan to make a formal announcement that Munetaka had formally adopted his younger brother as heir, and the report on the death of Munetaka was delayed until the following day. In 1752, Sendai Domain was struck by a severe famine. While touring a stricken village in what is now Watari District, Miyagi on his way back from sankin-kōtai in Edo, he was directly petitioned by the headman of Nakaizumi village, Kitahara Kanehira, for a reduction in the village's taxes. As was the common punishment for such an action, the headman's house and fields were confiscated and he was crucified as punishment, Munemura died in 1756, and was succeeded by his son, Date Shigemura. His grave is at the Date clan mausoleum at Dainenjiyama in Sendai.

By its very nature (normal) superconductivity (condensation of electrons into the BCS ground state) cannot exist together with ferromagnetism (condensation of electrons into the same spin state, all pointing in the same direction). Reentrance is when while changing a continuous parameter, superconductivity is first observed, then destroyed by the ferromagnetic order, and later reappears. An example is the changing of the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer in a bilayer of a superconductor and a ferromagnet. At a certain thickness superconductivity is destroyed by the Andreev reflected electrons in the ferromagnet, but if the thickness increases, this effect disappears again. Another example are materials with a curie temperature below the superconducting transition temperature. When cooling, first superconducting order appears in the electron system. Cooling further, the ferromagnetic order energetically wins over the superconducting order in the electron system. At even lower energy superconductivity reenters, and a nonuniform magnetic order appears. there is ferromagnetic order on short length scales, but superconducting order on large length scales.

Biography Shigemura was the second son of Date Munemura. His infant name was Gihachirō (儀八郎), and he was renamed Date Kunimura on the death of his elder brother in 1745. At the time of his genpuku ceremony in 1755, he received a kanji from Shōgun Tokugawa Ieshige and thus became Date Shigemura. He became daimyō at the age of 15 the following year, on the death of his father. Due to his youth, the shogunate appointed his uncle, Tamura Murataka of Ichinoseki Domain as his guardian. He inherited a dire situation, in which the domain was suffering from a great famine, finances were in arrears, and there was bitter in-fighting between the various senior retainers. In 1760, Shigemura married his second cousin, Toshiko, the daughter of the kuge, Hirohata Nakatada, and adopted daughter of the Kampaku Konoe Uchisaki. This year also marked the end of his guardianship, and he was free to start to reform the situation within the domain on his own. However, he was severely sidetracked by an issue over his courtesy title and Court rank. Nominally, Sendai Domain was considered to have the same status in the Shōgun’s court as Kagoshima Domain. In 1764, Shimazu Shigehide, daimyō of Kagoshima, received promotion to Junior Fourth Rank, Senior grade and Sakonoe-gon-chūjō (Lieutenant General of the Left Guards). Unable to abide by being surpassed by Shigehide, who was three years younger, Shigemura was forced to make a tremendous outlay in presents and bribes to shogunal officials to have his courtesy titles and position raised as well. To pay for these expenses, he demanded that his senior retainers accept cuts in their stipends, and those who protested were placed under house arrest. In 1767, he finally achieved promotion, but at the cost of 220,000 ryō. In 1768, Sendai Domain received an order from the Shogunate to mint iron coins for a seven-year period. Normally, minting was considered a very lucrative task; however, the sudden influx of vast amounts of coinage from Sendai Domain created inflation nationwide, which drove the value of the coinage down. Also, as the traditional copper coinage was considered more valuable than Sendai iron coins despite having the same face value, this caused much confusion in the market. The shogunate intervened in 1772 to cut the contract short; but then relented in 1776 to permit another two years of production, as long as the coins remained within the borders of Sendai. These antics did nothing to improve on the even worsening financial situation and political in-fighting within the domain. In 1790, Shigemura resigned in favor of his son, and died six years later at the domain's shimoyashiki in Edo.

The edict was signed by Louis XVI on 7 November 1787, and registered in the Parlement of Paris of the Ancien Régime on 29 January 1788. Its successful enactment was due to persuasive arguments by prominent French philosophers and literary personalities of the day, including Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, the Duc de Choiseul, by Americans such as Benjamin Franklin, and especially by the joint work of Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, minister to Louis XVI, and Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne, spokesman for the Protestant community in France.Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, Edict of Versailles (1787) , downloaded 29 January 2012 Henry IV of France (1589–1610) had initially granted Huguenots a significant amount of freedom to practice their faith when he signed the Edict of Nantes (13 April 1598). These rights were revoked by Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau (18 October 1685). Enforcement of the revocation relaxed under the reign of Louis XV, but it remained law for a century. Under the Edict of Versailles, Roman Catholicism continued as the state religion of the Kingdom of France, but relief was offered to non-Catholic worshippers – Calvinist Huguenots, Lutherans, and Jews alike. Considering the long-standing dominance of this religion, restrictions were still placed on non-Catholics around the country, keeping the outliers of the time behind the scenes at the workplace and in educational settings, so as not to misrepresent the Kingdom. The most notable example of these restrictions was in Metz, where actions by the Parlement of Metz explicitly excluded certain rights for Jews within its domain, such as drafting of lists of grievances, that did not apply to coreligionists elsewhere. While the Edict of Versailles did not proclaim freedom of religion across France, which would occur with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789, it was an important step in pacifying religious tensions and officially ended religious persecution in France.

Architecture St Alban's is constructed in brick with stone dressings, and is roofed in clay tiles. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, north and south transepts, a vestry, and a chancel. The clerestory has three-light windows, and there are four-light windows along the sides of the aisles. The east window has five lights, and the west wall is blank. The south transept forms a continuation of the aisle, but the north transept is taller, it carries the bellcote, and has its own roof. The vestry has a pyramidal roof. Inside the church, the brick arcades are carried on octagonal stone piers. In the chancel are a sedilia and piscina, both with ogee-heads. The 2000 extension contains doors leading to offices.

The pursuit of the heiress: aristocratic marriage in Ireland 1740–1840, UHS, 2006, p.151 Life Piers came from a long-established family of the Anglo-Irish gentry, seated at Tristernagh Abbey in County Westmeath. The family were descended from William Piers, who had been granted the Abbey lands by Elizabeth I: William's great-grandson Sir Henry Piers was created a baronet in 1661.Lodge; Archdall (1789), The Peerage of Ireland, 2, Dublin, p. 202 By the time of his descendant Sir John Piers, the Abbey had been demolished and incorporated into a house which had itself fallen into disrepair, and which was allegedly the inspiration for Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent.Casey and Rowan, The Buildings of Ireland: North Leinster: The Counties of Longford, Louth, Meath and Westmeath, 1993, p.147 Sir John was the eldest son of Sir Pigott William Piers, 5th Baronet, and his wife Elizabeth Smythe, and succeeded to his father's title and estates in 1798. He first married Mary Pratt, the daughter of Rev. Joseph Pratt of Cabra, in August 1796; she died in 1798.The Peerage Piers was later to gain a reputation as a rakehell, duelist, and gambler. In 1803 he met Elizabeth Denny, an actress at Astley's theatre in Dublin, and set up a household with her. The couple had seven children: Henrietta, Henry, John Edward, William Stapleton, George, Louisa, and Florence, born between 1803 and 1819. Piers v Piers (1849) 11 HLC 331 at p.333, 9 ER 1118 at p.1119 The Cloncurry scandal  Crim. Con, an 1807-8 satirical print referencing the Cloncurry scandal and court case. Piers and Lady Cloncurry are observed by the painter Gabrielli. The caption notes that the \\"sketch [...] has been valued at Twenty Thousand pounds!\\", in reference to the huge damages awarded to Lord Cloncurry. Piers gained public notoriety after an 1807 \\"criminal conversation\\" trial. He was seen with Elizabeth Georgiana, Lady Cloncurry, the wife of an old school friend (and creditor), Lord Cloncurry, and it later emerged they had been conducting an affair. Moreover, it was established that Piers had seduced Lady Cloncurry as part of a bet:Lehane, B. The companion guide to Ireland, 2001, pp.98–99 if he succeeded, a sum of money would be deposited in his bank account by a person whose identity was never revealed. The evidence included letters in which he addressed Lady Cloncurry, sensationally by the standards of the time, as his \\"beloved Eliza\\", and referred to her husband as a \\"poor tame wretch\\".The New Annual Register, 1808, p.42 Piers did not attend the trial, having fled to the Isle of Man, and Lord Cloncurry was awarded the enormous sum of £20,000 in damages, the joint largest recorded award ever in a criminal conversation case.Gibson, C. Dissolving Wedlock, 2002, p.34. The other case was that of Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley against Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. Lady Cloncurry was sent home to her father, General Charles Morgan, and divorced by her husband in 1811 (each of them subsequently remarried). The scandal was of great interest to the media of the time, particularly in view of what were regarded as the \\"humorous\\" circumstances of the discovery. The \\"preoccupied\\" couple had been observed by an Italian mural- painter, Gaspare Gabrielli, who was working in the same room at the Cloncurrys' country house, Lyons Demesne, on a ladder. The Isle of Man Piers and his partner Miss Denny took a house in Braddan and became fairly prominent in island society. He was not, however, necessarily able to avoid his old ways, as he is recorded as appearing before the Deemster along with two others (a Major-General Stapleton and Captain Edwards) after they started a fight while part of a theatre audience.Belchem, J. A New History of the Isle of Man: The modern period 1830–1999, Liverpool University Press, 2000 p.379 He was also recorded, a matter of months after the trial, as fighting a duel with a John Meredith Esq. over a bet made at dinner; Meredith fired early, missing Piers, who \\"advanced towards him, and ordered him to go down to his knees and beg, for pardon and life\\".Moore, Douglas 100 Years Ago: An Account Illustrative of Manx Life and Manners at that Period, 1904, p.34 Meredith was later shot dead in a further duel by a Mr Boyes or Boyce, one of Piers' seconds.Harrison, W.Bibliotheca monensis, 1867, p.76 Hannah Bullock, who in 1816 published the History of the Isle of Man, commented that from the arrival of Piers and his associates \\"peace spread her wings, and for many months was heard of no more [...] I am not exaggerating when I assert that every evening closed upon a quarrel\\".Moore, 1904, pp.35-36 In 1810 it was reported that Piers, still a figure of public interest, had finally shot himself after having \\"debauched the daughter of a respectable clergyman\\",The Annual Register of World Events: A Review of the Year, Volume 50, 1810, p.80 but the reports were evidently exaggerated. It was claimed that Piers and Miss Denny - subsequently Lady Piers - were married in May 1815, while still living in the Isle of Man.The Bad Baronet of Braddan ; Piers v Piers (1849) 11 HLC 331, 9 ER 1118 The marriage was held privately at their home: according to Piers this was because his mother disapproved of the relationship, and he wanted to have the opportunity of explaining the circumstances to her before making the marriage public.Reports of cases argued and determined in the High Court of Chancery: during the time of Lord Chancellor Plunket, Volume 1, 1839, p.294 This later caused problems when it was discovered that no special licence had been obtained and the marriage might not have been legal under Manx law. Lady Piers later testified that \\"I am quite certain that [Piers] intended to solemnize a legal and valid marriage, as he frequently expressed to me an anxious wish that I might have issue which would inherit his estates\\".Piers v Piers (1849) 11 HLC 331 at p.334, 9 ER 1118 at p.1119 The couple's youngest daughters, Louisa and Florence, took action against Piers' heir, his brother Henry Samuel Piers, to recover money they claimed due to them as John Piers' legitimate children (Piers' sons were born before the 1815 marriage). They succeeded in their claim to legitimacy, and the case (Piers v Piers) remains the leading case in English law on the presumption of marriage. Keane and McKeown, The Modern Law of Evidence, 2016, p.319 After spending several years in the Isle of Man, Piers returned to Tristernagh, where he had a house built surrounded by a high wall to keep out his creditors. Despite this he was eventually forced to pay the damages in the Cloncurry suit, with great reluctance. Later years Piers was again in court in 1830, when Richard Malone Esq. accused him of provoking a breach of the peace. It was claimed that Piers had fired his gun in the prosecutor's demesne \\"as an intentional insult\\" and that Piers had also written a \\"most severe and offensive letter\\" to Malone following an argument between Malone's gamekeeper and his son John.The Law Recorder: Containing Reports of Cases and Proceedings in the Courts of Law and Equity at Dublin and Elsewhere, v4. 1831, p.102 The court held that, despite his actions, Piers had not been intending to provoke Malone into fighting a duel. Piers and his family eventually moved to Saint-Omer in France, where they lived on the small income that could be obtained from his estates. Piers died in 1845 and is buried in Saint-Omer. He was succeeded as baronet by his brother, but the affair had been disastrous for the family's fortunes: by the 1850s Tristernagh was said to be \\"in a frightful state of delapidation, and the family estates much encumbered\\".Ó Cléirigh, Mícheál. Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, v5, Hodges, Smith & Co, 1856, p.1620 Poem One of John Betjeman's earliest published poems, first printed in the Westmeath Examiner, was titled Sir John Piers, and reimagines the scandal. Part I, The Fete Champetre, describes a fashionable picnic attended by Lord and Lady Cloncurry and Piers, \\"the handsomest blade in the County Westmeath\\"; Part II, The Attempt, is spoken by Piers to Lady Cloncurry; Part III, The Exile, describes the baronet in disgrace on the Isle of Man; and IV, The Return, is again spoken by Piers as he plans the building of his walls at Tristernagh. Part V, Tristernagh Today, is a present-day supernatural coda in which the narrator encounters something unpleasant near Tristernagh churchyard. Betjeman adopts a humorous style, parodying nineteenth-century verse forms, through much of the poem. Betjeman also participated in a 1978 documentary on the crim. con. case, The Bold Bad Baronet, produced for BBC Northern Ireland and presented by Frank Delaney. Delaney developed the theory that Sir John Piers' partner in the \\"diabolical wager\\", who was never identified, had likely been Lord Cloncurry himself, who owned land adjacent to Piers' demesne on the shores of Lough Iron.See Delaney, F. Rewriting History, address to the Federation of Historical Societies, 2001. Accessed 3-02-12 Delaney surmised that Cloncurry had bet that Piers could not seduce Lady Cloncurry, in the knowledge that even if he lost the bet he could take Piers to court. Much of the Tristernagh estate was later bought by Cloncurry.

In 2000 he received the \\"Special Award for Human Rights Journalism Under Threat\\", Amnesty Media Award. In 2002, he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Background Gómez began working at El Espectador, a daily newspaper in Bogota, at the age of 24. The paper's editor-in-chief at the time was Guillermo Cano, who was a hero of Gómez. On 17 December 1986, only a few weeks after Gómez's hiring, Cano was assassinated outside the El Espectador's office by a man with a submachine gun, apparently in retaliation for his reporting on Pablo Escobar and other drug lords. In the 1980s and 1990s, Colombia had the highest rate of murders of reporters in the world, and over the next fourteen years, ten more El Espectador reporters would be murdered. Gómez later described the mood at El Espectador as \\"like having your gravestone tied around your neck\\". Reporting In the late 1980s, Gómez continued Cano's mission of aggressively investigating Pablo Escobar's connections with the Colombian government, at one point publishing a list of properties in Medellín that the drug lord secretly owned. He also expanded his reporting into coverage of the conflict with far-right paramilitary groups, such as Carlos Castaño's Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Córdoba and Urabá (ACCU). In September 1988, he was forced to flee the country after a firebombing of El Espectador's offices believed to be a retaliation for his reporting, but he returned nine months later. In 1989 alone, he reported on 36 separate massacres. In 1996, Gómez co-founded La Fundación para la Libertad de Prensa (English: \\"The Foundation for Press Freedom\\"; abbreviated \\"FLIP\\"), a non- profit organization to protect threatened journalists. He also served as the group's executive director until 2001. Gómez is best known for his coverage of the Mapiripán massacre, a \\"five-day killing spree\\" in July 1997 in which Colombian Army officers colluded with the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) to kill at least 49 people in the village of Mapiripán suspected of being guerrilla sympathizers. The killers used machetes and chainsaws, dismembering the corpses and throwing the pieces into the river. When Gómez broke the story of the Army's involvement in February 2000, he received 56 threats in the next two months. On 24 May, a group of men attempted to abduct Gómez as he was entering a taxi in Bogota, but he escaped. The next day, Gómez's colleague Jineth Bedoya was kidnapped, tortured, and raped; her kidnappers told her that they \\"planned to cut Gómez into tiny pieces\\". Amnesty International also issued a statement of concern for his safety, describing his case as \\"a clear example of the campaign of terror Colombian journalists are increasingly subjected to\\". On 1 June 2000, Gómez left the country, moving to Massachusetts, US, where he served for a year as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. He returned to Colombia in late 2001, becoming the Director of Investigations for the television news show Noticias Uno. After a report on links between presidential candidate Álvaro Uribe Vélez (who became President of Colombia later in the year) and the Medellín Cartel, Gómez was once again the target of death threats, along with news director Daniel Coronell and Coronell's three-year-old daughter, prompting Reporters Without Borders to issue of a statement of protest on their behalf. On 24 May 2011, burglars tried to force their way into Gómez's home for the seventh time in ten years; noting the \\"sophisticated equipment\\" of the burglars, he attributed the attempted break-in to agents of Colombia's Administrative Department of Security. Awards and recognition In 2000 Gómez was the recipient of the \\"Special Award for Human Rights Journalism Under Threat\\" at the Amnesty International UK Media Awards. In addition to his 2001 Nieman Fellowship, Gómez was awarded the 2002 International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". In the award citation, the CPJ praised Gómez's \\"exceptional commitment to truth and freedom\\". In 2010, Gómez's organization FLIP won the Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism, awarded by the Missouri School of Journalism.

Biography Born in Lübeck in the north of Germany, Berg possibly first worked as a sculptor in Veit Stoss's workshop in Nuremberg.\\"Claus Bergs altertavle\\", Odense Domkirke. Retrieved 31 January 2012. He was invited to Denmark by Queen Christine, arriving in about 1504 to head the workshop in Odense, one of the most important in Europe at the time, where he coordinated the work of his 12 assistants until 1532. The queen took great care of him, giving him Apostelgården, a nearby farm, as a home and, by some accounts, providing him with the company of one of her maids as a wife.Johanne Duus Hornemann, \\"Pragtstykket i dansk kirkekunst\\", Kristendom.dk, 15 November 2006. Retrieved 31 January 2012. In 1507, he is mentioned as a citizen of Odense and in 1508 and 1510 as a painter in the queen's accounts. The decorated choir in Odense's Gråbrødre Church, especially the altarpiece which can now be seen in Odense Cathedral, is the only work which can be directly attributed to Berg. It appears to have been undertaken at the request of the queen who wished to prepare the Gråbrødre Church, which has since been demolished, as the burial site for her husband and herself. Other works have been ascribed to him on the basis of their style, for example the altarpiece in Sanderum.Ulla Haastrup, \\"Claus Berg\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon.

Works Claus Berg: Altarpiece in Odense Cathedral The altarpiece from Gråbrødre Church, now in Odense Cathedral, was probably completed after the death of Queen Catherine in 1521. Standing 3.75 metres high, the carved oak triptych depicts the traditional, if unusually interconnected, themes of the crucifixion, the passion and the crowning of Mary.Hans Arnold Gräbke, \\"Berg, Claus\\", Allgemeine deutsche Biographie & Neue deutsche Biographie (Digitale Register), Behaim - Bürkel, Bd.: 2, Berlin, 1955, p.75. Retrieved 31 January 2012. The central section shows the crucified Jesus on the tree of life surrounded by apostles, Biblical and historical figures, with Francis of Assisi at his feet. Above, Mary is crowned queen of heaven surrounded by sparkling angels. Below, Saint Anne is shown with the infant Jesus and his mother Mary. The side wings present the Passion, from the Last Supper to the Ascension with the apostles at Pentecost at the bottom right. The base shows members of the royal family including King Christian II, King Hans and his wife Queen Christine, now dressed as a widow. The style indicates connections with southern German art, characterized by the realistic, plastic look of the figures, probably inspired by Albrecht Dürer from Nuremberg.\\"Claus Berg\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 31 January 2012. Restoration work in 1973-86 showed how the altarpiece consisted of a basic carved skeleton which was then gilded and painted. Some 90 per cent of the original work was preserved under several layers of subsequent coating. Other works ascribed to Berg include the altarpieces in Bregninge Church on Ærø, in Sanderum Church near Odense and in the Church of Our Lady in Aarhus and crucifixes in Asperup Church and Vindinge Church on Funen and in Sorø Church (1527). Berg's workshop also produced limestone reliefs as well as tombstones for King Hans in Odense Cathedral (originally in Gråbrødre Church) and for Bishop Ivan Munk in Ribe Cathedral.

Early life He was second son of Richard Dobbs (1743–1775), Rector of Clougherny and Lisburn, and his wife Mary Young of Lisnane, and nephew of Arthur Dobbs, the governor of North Carolina.Lisburn Cathedral and Its Past Rectors. He was born on 27 April 1750, and took a degree at Trinity College, Dublin.William Benjamin Sarsfield Taylor, History of the University of Dublin (1845), p. 446; archive.org. He was in the 63rd Regiment of Foot for around five years, leaving in 1773. Dobbs entered the Middle Temple in London in 1773; and was called to the Irish bar in 1775. In Dublin he took a leading part in social life, but was noted for growing eccentricity. Volunteer Dobbs joined The Monks of the Screw, a political drinking club. Together with other members (John Forbes, Joseph Pollock, Charles Francis Sheridan), he visited Ulster at the end of 1779 and beginning of 1780, to gather support for patriotic and nationalist plans.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography theme, The Monks of the Screw. Dobbs was a leading Volunteer and friend of James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont. In 1780 Lord George Gordon made himself unpopular in the Westminster Parliament, by reading out the pamphlet Dobbs had addressed to Lord North.William Cobbett, Thomas Curson Hansard, The Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Period to the Year 1803 vol. 20 (1814), p. 677; Google Books. The English reformer John Cartwright wrote to Dobbs the same year, seeking to have advice in case an English volunteer force could be raised.Padhraig Higgins, A Nation of Politicians: gender, patriotism, and political culture in late eighteenth-century Ireland (2010), p. 133; Google Books. At this period of his life Dobbs was in correspondence also with John Jebb in England.Anthony Page, John Jebb and the Enlightenment origins of British Radicalism(2003), p. 254; Google Books. Dobbs was the representative of a northern volunteer corps at the Dungannon Convention in 1782. There he presented an ambitious plan of reform in Ireland, including a simplified liturgy.Tony Claydon, Ian McBride (editors), Protestantism and National Identity: Britain and Ireland, c.1650-c.1850 (2007), pp. 255–6; Google Books. On the granting of the Constitution of 1782, at the prompting of Henry Grattan, Dobbs wrote in his History \\"it was on the plains of America that Ireland obtained her freedom\\", attributing the legislative powers now given to the Irish Parliament to the outcome of the American War of Independence.David A. Valone, Jill Marie Bradbury (editors), Anglo-Irish Identities 1571–1845 (2008), p. 18; Google Books. Dobbs took a commission in a fencible regiment. In so doing he put himself in a minority in the Irish Volunteers, where the general opinion was that the fencibles were being recruited to undermine them.Vincent Morley, Irish Opinion and the American Revolution, 1760–1783 (2002), p. 307; Google Books. For that reason he was not allowed to attend the Dungannon Convention held in September 1783. In the Irish Parliament Dobbs was completely opposed to legislative union with England, and believed it was impious. Caulfield and others leaders decided to make use of him, and in 1797 he was returned to the Irish House of Commons for the borough of Charlemont. The Irish Rebellion of 1798, in May and June of that year, left the government holding many prisoners. In the middle of July, on his own account, Samuel Neilson of the United Irishmen decided to come to terms; and Dobbs was brought in to mediate, on 22 July. He reported to Lord Castlereagh the following day. Castlereagh wanted to wait for the outcome of the trial of Oliver Bond, which was in progress. On the 27th Dobbs with sheriffs went round the prisons to try to get agreement for a settlement with the government. Despite an intervening execution, that of William Michael Byrne,William Michael Byrne, from A Compendium of Irish Biography, 1878. agreement was reached on the 29th, saving Bond's life.Richard Robert Madden, The United Irishmen, Their Lives and Times (1842), pp. 149–50;archive.org. Dobbs delivered a parliamentary speech, and submitted five propositions for tranquillising the country, which were published in 1799. His major speech was delivered against the Union Bill on 7 June 1800; supporting a motion to postpone the third reading of the Bill, he commented on the current state of Europe, in the light of the Book of Daniel, to the effect that the Union would never be operative.William Conyngham Plunket, John Baptist Cashel Hoey (editor), Speeches at the Bar and in the Senate (1865), p. 79; archive.org. Later life With the passing of the Act of Union 1800. Dobbs sank into obscurity; he could not get any more of his books published, and his eccentricities increased to mental illness. He died in poverty on 11 April 1811. Works In 1773 Dobbs's tragedy, The Patriot King, or the Irish Chief was played in Dublin.Samuel Carlyle Hughes, The Pre- Victorian Drama in Dublin (1904), p. 63;archive.org . It was published in London in 1774, and besides the Smock Alley Theatre was put on in Rathfarnham and Belfast. Its theme was the defeat of a Viking invader by Irish forces.ricorso.net, Francis Dobbs. Dobbs published political pamphlets during the Volunteer agitation: * A Letter to Lord North, 1780; * Thoughts on Volunteers, 1781; * A History of Irish Affairs from 12 Oct 1779 to 15 Sep 1782, 1782; and * Thoughts on the present Mode of Taxation in Great Britain, 1784. Dobbs then published in 1787 four large volumes of a Universal History, commencing at the Creation and ending at the death of Christ, in letters from a father to his son, in which he tried to prove historically the exact fulfilment of the Messianic prophecies. He also published in 1788 a volume of poems, most of which had appeared in periodicals. His major speech was published as Substance of a Speech delivered in the Irish House of Commons 7 June 1800, in which is predicted the second coming of the Messiah. It is said that 30,000 copies were immediately sold. He argued that the Union was forbidden by scripture, by quoting texts from Daniel and the Book of Revelation. He published in the same year his Concise View of the Great Predictions in the Sacred Writings, and his Summary of Universal History, in nine volumes.

Biography Ordained in 1955, Sengol was named Bishop on 30 December 1990 and resigned in 1997. He died in 2012, aged 83.Gabriel Lawrence Sengol at Catholic Hierarchy website Most Rev. Sengole Lawrence Gabriel was born on 18 September 1928 at Madhakottai, Thanjavur District, Tamil Nadu. He did his schooling in Thanjavur and Seminary formation at Poonamallee, Chennai. He was ordained priest on 27 April 1955. During his pastoral ministry Fr. Gabriel served as Asst. Parish Priest at Pudukottai (1955) and at Vailankanni (1955-1964); as Parish Priest at Alangudu (1964) and at Karunganni (1964-1967); as Rector of the St. Mary’s Minor Seminary, Thanjavur (1967-1982) and as Parish Priest at Vailankannni (1982-1990). Fr. Gabriel contributed immensely to the phenomenal growth of the Shrine Basilica of Vailankanni both as Asst. Parish Priest and Parish Priest. He erected many buildings and bought a lot of land with the intention of developing Vailankanni just like Lourdes in France. In order to provide adequate safety to pilgrims, he reinforced the security personnel. It was at his time that, through the efforts of Bishop Sundaram and his own hard work, the Shrine of Our Lady of Health, Vailankanni was elevated to the status of Basilica by Pope John XXIII. He encouraged the pilgrimages from all corners of Tamil Nadu as well as from other parts of India. In order to enhance the quality and extent of the accommodation of pilgrims, he undertook the construction of many houses/buildings/halls with other residential facilities, v.gr. a hospital for the sick pilgrims, a community hall and an open air auditorium, various cottages and lodges. He also established a new colony known as Antoniarpuram, and provided several quarters for the benefit of the staff. Fr. Gabriel persuaded several Religious Congregations to establish their houses at the Shrine. While the Sisters of Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Louis Gonzaga are catering to the spiritual needs of the pilgrims, the Missionaries of Charity (MC) take care of the abandoned children and the handicapped. The blessing of the extremely sick with the Blessed Sacrament on every First Saturday as in Lourdes has been a great consolation to the many sick pilgrims that come to the Shrine. He introduced the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament on every First Saturday, and the exposition of the Holy Eucharist every day all through the year. Besides, he was much interested in promoting Marian devotion through literature. In the educational field, he not only built a school for the local boys and girls at Vailankanni but even got it upgraded to the status of a Higher Secondary School. Moreover, he set up schools in many sub-stations of the Parish of Vailankanni and built/renovated some Chapels, particularly where the Christians were less in number. Press apostolate has always been his favorite option. Besides authoring and editing some books, he did encourage people to write for journals. He always advocated the belief that Catholic books sustain a high culture and nurture piety. He also promoted reading habits and for this purpose he founded Oli Nilaya and a Library in Thanjavur. For 13 years he was editor of Vailankanni Kuraloli (Tamil monthly of the Shrine Basilica of Vailankanni) and also headed Vedanayakar Ezhuthalar Kazhakam (Tamil Writers’ Association). In fact, he initiated and encouraged the translation of the Papal Encyclicals. He was National Secretary of the Pontifical Missionary Union for 15 years. In this capacity, he visited almost all the Dioceses of India from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. Wherever he went he spread the devotion to Our Lady of Health Vailankanni and introduced the English monthly ‘Vailankanni Calling’. He strengthened the Legion of Mary not only in the Diocese of Thanjavur but also in the whole of Tamil Nadu. He served as the Inspector of schools of the Diocese of Thanjavur for three years and as the Regional Secretary of TNBC for the Catechism. On 6 October 1990 Fr. Gabriel was appointed Bishop of Tiruchirapalli and was ordained Bishop on 30 December 1990. Simplicity, humility and kindness were the hallmarks of his personality. During his episcopal ministry, he visited the villages and constructed Chapels in many of them. He established at least 10 new parishes. He spared no efforts to make his Diocese financially self-reliant. He had a great devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, which he promoted wherever he went among priests and people. During his pastoral visits to parishes he catechized the faithful to deepen the faith of his flock. In order to make Jesus Christ more and more known and loved, he encouraged the people to read the Word of God daily and he even supplied the Bible free of cost to all parishes and sub- stations. Very loyal to the Magisterium of the Church, Bishop Gabriel devoted himself tirelessly to the ministry of evangelization, catechesis and charismatic renewal. As a matter of fact, he was deeply convinced about the evangelization done through Kalai Kaviri School of Fine Arts. He gave many talks in All India Radio and his clearly articulated sermons were much appreciated by the people. Despite all his wonderful achievements and exemplary pastoral leadership, Bishop Gabriel also had his share of suffering and crosses. But in all the adversities that he faced in his Diocese, he always trusted in the Providence of God and maternal protection of Blessed Virgin Mary. On 14 October 1997, he resigned as Bishop of Tiruchirapalli after serving the Diocese for seven years. Thereafter, he retired to Vettaikaraniruppu, a remote rural village where he could spend his time in prayer and evangelizing the poor people. He helped the local parish priest in spiritual activities and went about preaching the Word of God all over Tamil Nadu. The funeral service of Bishop Sengole Lawrence Gabriel held on 30 January 2012, at the St. Mary’s Cathedral, was largely attended by several Bishops, hundreds of priests, religious and lay faithful. The body was taken to his home Diocese of Thanjavur where it was buried as per his wish. May God of Mercies grant this zealous Pastor and faithful servant of the Church eternal bliss and heavenly reward! You are kindly requested to offer one Holy Mass for the repose of the soul of Bishop Sengole Lawrence, late CBCI member. Yours sincerely in Christ, www.cbci.in/Circular.aspx/ Fr.

In a career that lasted from April 1790 to 1793 he ran nine times and won five races. In the summer of 1790 he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, winning The Derby while still undefeated. He raced until the age of six, winning three further races. All of his runs apart from the Derby were at Newmarket. Background Rhadamanthus, described as either a bay or brown horse, was bred by his owner Lord Grosvenor from his mare Flyer, who went on to produce the 1794 Derby winner Daedalus. Rhadamanthus and Daedalus were the most notable horses sired by Lord Grosvenor's horse Justice, who during his racing career had won two races at Newmarket. Racing career =1790: three-year-old season= Lord Grosvenor, owner and breeder of Rhadamanthus, attributed to Joshua Reynolds Rhadamanthus made his first racecourse appearance at Newmarket's First Spring meeting on 25 April, when he contested a division of the Prince's Stakes \\"Across the flat\\" (ten furlongs). He started the even money favourite and won from Lord Derby's Lee Boo and the Duke of Bedford's Thunderbolt. At the next Newmarket meeting he was withdrawn from a match race against Lord Egremont's colt Precipitate, with Lord Grosvenor paying a forfeit. Lord Grosvenor was strongly represented in the Derby at Epsom on 22 May. Apart from Rhadamanthus, the 5/4 favourite, he was also represented by Asparagus, who was second in the betting at 4/1. Ridden by John Arnull (or Arnold), Rhadamanthus beat his stable companion to win the ten runner race, with Lee Boo finishing third. Rhadamanthus was off the racecourse for almost five months before returning for two races at Newmarket in autumn. On 19 October he ran in a Sweepstakes for three-year-olds over the two-mile \\"Ditch In\\" course. Starting at odds of 1/3 against six opponents, he won from the Prince of Wales's colt Fitzwilliam. Rhadamanthus's unbeaten run came to an end on 1 November, when he finished second to Asparagus at level weights in a five-runner Sweepstakes Across the Flat. =1791: four-year-old season= Rhadamanthus was entered for the Claret Stakes on 13 May, but did not run. His first and only appearance in 1791 was at Newmarket's July meeting where he contested a Sweepstakes for four-year- olds over ten furlongs. He started the 5/4 favourite and won from Chanticleer, who was conceding eleven pounds, Old Gold and Caroline, earning 1,350 guineas for Lord Grosvenor. =1792: five-year-old season= Rhadamanthus's first run of 1792 came in the Oatlands Stakes, a handicap race at Newmarket over two miles on 7 April. With more than fifty subscribers paying 100 guineas to enter, the race's prize of 5,375 guineas made it far more valuable than any of the Classics- the Derby for instance attracted thirty-two entries at 50 guineas for a prize of 1,600 guineas. Rhadamanthus started the 5/2 favourite in a field of twenty runners but finished unplaced behind Mr Bullock's horse Toby. Later that month Lord Grosvenor claimed a prize of 1,200 guineas when Rhadamanthus was allowed to walk over in a Sweepstakes over Newmarket's Round Course, the other fifteen entries having been withdrawn Rhadamanthus made his only other start of the season at Newmarket in autumn. On 18 October he finished unplaced behind Mr Bullock's horse Halbert in a 60 guinea weight-for- age race over the Ditch In course. =1793: six-year-old season= Rhadamanthus ran only once in his final season. On 30 April he received eleven pounds from Mr Wilson's six-year-old Buzzard and was beaten in a match race over the Rowley Mile course. Stud career By 1795, Radamanthus had been sold to William Frisby and was standing for one guinea and a half crown at various locations in Northamptonshire, cycling throughout the week between Market Harborough, Stamford, Uppingham, and Oakham. The only foals sired by \\"Rhadamanthus\\" in the General Stud Book were the progeny of another stallion of the same name who was foaled in 1815.

He makes photo-based art that explores themes of visual memory and modern communication via the elemental properties of the pixel and the low-fi aesthetic of the screen-grab. His subjects, ranging from candy wrappers and emojis to haute couture and works of art reflect an uncritical fascination for the artificial and the man-made. His process, often pixelating images beyond recognition, criss crosses the border between figuration and abstraction, and his work takes the form of digital prints, sculpture, video, books, and painting. He is a founding member of the ABC Artists' Books Cooperative. His work has been exhibited internationally and he is represented by Benrubi Gallery in New York, USA. His work was included in 'Signs of a Struggle: Photography in the Wake of Postmodernism' at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, UK in 2011, and was featured in a two-person show, 'Mosaico', with the American photographer John Pfahl at Nina Freudenheim Gallery, Buffalo, USA in 2012. Other museum shows include 'Sight Reading: Photography and the Legible World' (2016) at the Morgan Library & Museum, New York, which presented his Pixles series based on Beatles album covers, and 'Fiction and Fabrication: Photography of Architecture after the Digital Turn' (2019) at MAAT, Lisbon, Portugal, which showed pictures from his Designer Labels series.

Classification Depending on the design of the vehicle, a motorized trike may be categorized as a motorcycle, motor scooter, or simply the three-wheeled counterpart to a motorized or electric bicycle. The main difference between a motorcycle trike and a scooter trike is that motorcycles are sat on in a \\"saddle\\"-style seating (as with a horse), with the legs apart, and motorcycles have manual transmissions. Scooters have a \\"step-through\\" seating style, in which the driver sits on a more chair-like seat, with the legs together; as well, scooters have automatic transmissions. Laypersons often associate the engine size as a dividing line between motorcycles and scooters, since a typical scooter has a small 50 cc engine, but scooter engines can also be as large as 650cc as used in the Suzuki Burgman. Motorcycles with sidecars are not usually considered tricycles. It can be harder to categorize three-wheeled automobiles. While some early prototype automobiles were steam tricycles, three-wheeled cars such as the Morgan 3-Wheeler are often classified as cars rather than motorcycles. Generally, the motorcycle classification will require passengers to sit behind the driver, whereas in the car classification, at least one passenger is able to sit abreast to the driver. Motorcycle tricycles Reverse trike T-Rex motorized reverse trike A motorized tricycle's wheels may be arranged in either configuration: delta or tadpole. A delta trike has one wheel in front and two in back, and the tadpole trike has two wheels in front and one in back. Occasionally, rear wheel steering is used, although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling (the geometry is similar to a regular trike operating in reverse, but with a steering damper added). Tadpoles are more stable under braking and more likely to slide instead of roll; front braking hard on a delta requires the vehicle to steer almost straight to avoid tipping. The balance of friction patches and rolling resistance also means that tadpoles tend to oversteer and deltas understeer. Motor trikes are attractive for those with mobility or balance problems. Under some local regulations, while riding a three-wheeled vehicle, it may be possible to carry multiple passengers with a motorcycle driving license, to ride a motorcycle-style vehicle with a car license, or to avoid motorcycle helmet use regulations. These machines are generally custom-built. A common arrangement is to fit chopper-style (\\"ape hanger\\") front forks to a VW Beetle engine and transaxle, popular because it is largely self-contained on a single subframe. Similarly, the engine, transmission and rear wheel may be taken from a large motorcycle as a single unit, and used in the construction of a tadpole trike. Mass-manufactured motor tricycles include the Piaggio MP3; the Piaggio Ape (Italian for Bee) delivery trike (delta); the Harley-Davidson Tri Glide Ultra Classic; the Bombardier Recreational Products Can-Am Spyder (tadpole); the Polaris Slingshot (tadpole); the T-Rex reverse trike; trikes used by municipal authorities in the USA; and, historically, vehicles such as the Scammell Scarab railway dray, a common sight around post- war British railway stations. Motorized freight trikes Tatra 49 freight motor tricycle tricycle, one of the most common forms of public transportation in the country. It is commonly confused with the tuk-tuk In Asian and Southeast Asian countries, motorized trikes are used as small freight trucks and commercial vehicles. Nicknamed \\"three-wheelers\\" or \\"tuk-tuks\\" in popular parlance, they are a motorized version of the traditional pulled rickshaw or cycle rickshaw. While they are mostly used as taxis for hire, they are also used for commercial and freight deliveries. They are particularly popular in cities where traffic congestion is a problem. They usually have a sheet-metal body or open frame that rests on three wheels, a canvas roof with drop-down sides, a small cabin in the front of the vehicle for the driver, an air-cooled scooter version of a two-stroke engine, with handlebar controls instead of a steering wheel. The smaller motorized trikes are used as delivery vehicles for lighter loads. The larger trikes, with more powerful engines, have larger cargo bays, and they can carry freight within a city. =China= Motorized three-wheel freight vehicles are a common sight throughout China. They come in various sizes, from open saddle-style trikes to 'three-wheel trucks' with a fully closed cabin. =Philippines= In the Philippines, a \\"motorbike and sidecar\\" is called a tricycle. They are commonly used as a public utility vehicle and for personal transportation. =India= Since 2012, electric tricycles known as e-rickshaws have become popular, replacing other commercial transports. For vehicles other than electric rickshaws, various locally made configurations are used in India. They fall under the category of Jugaad and serve as both passenger and commercial vehicles. The motorized versions are popular for their low cost, because they are put together from salvaged motorcycles and often do not require the operator to have a drivers license.

In 2001, she was awarded the Courage In Journalism Award of the International Women's Media Foundation.She also won the Golden Pen of Freedom award by the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers in 2020. May 2000 abduction In 2000, the 26-year-old Bedoya was working with Ignacio Gómez at the Bogota daily newspaper El Espectador, covering the Colombian war against terrorism. At the time of her abduction, she was investigating a story on arms trafficking by both state officials and the far-right paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). On 25 May, she visited La Modelo prison in Bogota, where she had been promised an interview with a paramilitary leader known as \\"the Baker\\". Suspecting a possible trap, she brought along an editor and photographer from El Espectador's staff, but when the pair were separated from her for a moment while awaiting clearance to go into the prison, she disappeared. Bedoya was seized, drugged, and forced into a car by three men. Her attackers drove her to a location several hours away, where they tortured and raped her. According to Bedoya, the men identified themselves as working for paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño. The kidnappers insisted that Bedoya \\"pay attention\\" as they raped her, telling her, \\"We are sending a message to the press in Colombia.\\" They also threatened her colleague, stating that they \\"planned to cut Gómez into tiny pieces\\"; Gómez would flee the country six days after the attack. Bedoya was left tied up in a garbage pile near a road, and when she crawled out, she was discovered by a taxi driver. The case was stalled for more than a decade with the Colombia Attorney General's office before Bedoya appealed it to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In May 2011, a paramilitary soldier was arrested and confessed to being one of Bedoya's three attackers. August 2003 abduction In 2001, Bedoya was hired by El Tiempo and was put in charge of its law enforcement coverage, including reporting on paramilitary groups. In early August 2003, she traveled to the town of Puerto Alvira to report on how it had been taken and held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for more than a year, forcing its 1,100 inhabitants into full-time cocaine production. The leader of the FARC guerrillas ordered the kidnapping of Bedoya and her photographer immediately on their arrival, stripping them of their cameras and clothing. Though the FARC leader had ordered that the journalists not be spoken with or fed, women of the town continued to bring them food. The townspeople tried without success to alert the Red Cross to the pair's abduction, and a local priest warned them that the guerrillas were planning to take them into the forest and murder them. After the townspeople alerted the regional FARC commander to the situation, however, the journalists were quickly freed. The commander offered to reimburse them for their lost time and equipment, but Bedoya and the photographer refused. On her return, Bedoya filed a story on living conditions in FARC-controlled territory, being careful not to incriminate any of the townspeople who had aided her. Later work Jineth Bedoya presenting Manual for journalists for the treatment of gender violence in Madrid. 26 October 2017 In November 2010, Bedoya released her book Vida y muerte del Mono Jojoy about Víctor Julio Suárez Rojas, better known as \\"Mono Jojoy\\", a FARC leader who had recently been killed. The book alleged that Mono Jojoy had issued an assassination order against Caracol Radio journalist Néstor Morales. In response, the FARC-aligned news agency Noticias Nueva Colombia posted a headline on its website accusing her of being a military intelligence agent, causing the Colombian-based Foundation for Press Freedom and Canadian Journalists for Free Expression to issue statements of concern for her safety. As of November 2011, Bedoya continues to work as a journalist for El Tiempo. For security, the Colombian government has assigned her three bodyguards as well as a bulletproof car.

Retrieved 2013-01-11. In 2001, Bedoya was awarded the Courage In Journalism Award of the International Women's Media Foundation. The award was \\"big news\\" in Colombia, raising Bedoya's profile and leading El Tiempo to hire her away from El Espectador. She later described the award as \\"one of the things that kept me going\\" after the first attack. In 2012, Bedoya was awarded the International Women of Courage Award. In October 2016 it was announced that RAW in WAR was awarding its annual Anna Politkovskaya Award to Bedoya.

History Known as one of the \\"second-generation\\" of Pre-Raphaelites, Stanhope was among Dante Gabriel Rossetti's mural-painting party at the Oxford Union in 1857, together with Arthur Hughes, John Hungerford Pollen, Valentine Prinsep, Ned Burne-Jones and William Morris (nicknamed Topsy). He was a founder member of the Hogarth Club, a direct descendant of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.A.M.W. Stirling, \\"The Life of Roddam Spencer Stanhope, Pre-Raphaelite, a Painter of Dreams,\\" in A Painter of Dreams and Other Biographical Studies (London: Lane, 1916). This painting, with his depiction of a prostitute remorsefully contemplating her life, showed a subject typical of the Victorian era. Works such as Thoughts of the Past and Rossetti's Found (1855) allowed the genteel gallery-going public to sympathise with societal problems - from a safe distance. It was pictures such as William Holman Hunt's The Awakening Conscience (1854), illustrating a married man and his mistress, which were regarded as threatening to Victorian family life.T. Hilto, The Pre-Raphelites, Thames and Hudson (1970). Cf. also Elaine Shefer, \\"The 'Bird in the Cage' in the \\"History of Sexuality: Sir John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt,\\" Journal of the History of Sexuality 1 (1991), p. 475, note 48. Stanhope painted Thoughts of the Past in a studio just above one owned by Rossetti. Although his model is recognisably Pre-Raphaelite, the background of his painting hints at his own individual, artistic style, which was yet to emerge.Elise Lawton Smith, Evelyn Pickering de Morgan and the Allegorical Body, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press (2002).

The film received multiple David di Donatello awards in Italy for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Score and Best Supporting Actor (to Angelo Infanti). It also won Silver Ribbons for Best Actress and for Best Score.  Plot summary  Sergio Benvenuti (Carlo Verdone) is a meek and timid young man who works as a door- to-door salesman; naturally, his disposition makes incredibly hard for him to convince potential customers to subscribe to the offers he peddles. Desperate to improve his sales' rate, he asks for the help of a more outgoing and successful colleague, Nadia, who agrees to take him with her to 'show him the ropes' of a successful sales pitch. Due to a mishap Sergio reaches the abode of a colorful, over-the-top character, who introduces himself as 'Manuel Fantoni' and entertains him with tall tales about his life and his acquaintances which, apparently (due to the large number of signed photographs that adorn his house) include a veritable host of Italian and American celebrities from both music and cinema. Oblivious of Nadia, Sergio is taken back to reality when the police arrives at the place, arresting 'Manuel' (who is revealed being actually named 'Cesare Cuticchia', a much-less-glamorous moniker) for a series of misdemeanors and taking him away. Before being led away in manacles Manuel/Giuseppe, asks Sergio to 'keep an eye' on his house, at which the timid young man sees the chance to \\"impersonate\\" Manuel (which was an invented person, anyhow) to play, for once, the role of the uber-cool, mysterious and affluent romantic hero. He sets his sights on Nadia, on which he already did develop a crush (which was the reason for asking her help in the first place), and he invites her to Manuel/Giuseppe's penthouse taking advantage of the fact that, having missed their business appointment, she has never seen him as 'Sergio'. While recounting her his own version of Manuel's tall tales...he tells her that he's a good friend of Lucio Dalla (at the time a hugely successful singer and performer in Italy) literally seeing the girl explode with joy. Nadia is a huge fan of Dalla and would like to meet him and give him a few songs she has recorded, hoping to start a musical career. Caught in his own web of lies, Sergio doesn't dare to tell her the truth and rushes to the jail to talk to Giuseppe, hoping that he can help him securing a meeting with Dalla to satisfy the girl. Giuseppe of course laughs at his request...the signed photos are all original but do hark back from a time when he owned a small restaurant frequented by actors and musicians, who often \\"paid\\" by leaving autographs magnifying the place and the \\"friendship\\" with Giuseppe. However the shrewd and cunning con-man urges Sergio to keep the pretense up in order to bed Nadia and then leave her, a perspective which intrigues and repels Sergio at the same time. Sergio is engaged to Rossella, a plain girl of modest culture and little charm, who wants desperately to marry him. Sergio loathes the perspective, but he's in awe of her burly, coarse and violent father, Augusto (Mario Brega), so the idea of having a tryst with Nadia before the marriage looks to him like the 'last chance' of leading a carefree life before ending up \\"married with children\\". The young man keeps playing the role of \\"Manuel\\", finding thin excuses for the delay of the meeting with Dalla which Nadia desires so much; in the end a romantic dinner with Nadia is crashed by the thunderous arrival of Augusto and Rossella which culminates in a beating during which his true identity is revealed. Nadia leaves the premises; several years later Sergio will meet her again...each one seeing the other caught up in a life they don't enjoy...they finally exchange a deep, passionate kiss.

In a brief career that lasted from April to October 1794 he ran three times and won once. He won the Derby on his racecourse debut, beating the smallest field in the history of the race. He was beaten in two races later that year and was retired. Background Daedalus (or Dædalus) was a bay horse bred by his owner Lord Grosvenor from his mare Flyer, who had previously produced the 1790 Derby winner Rhadamanthus. Daedalus and Rhadamanthus were the most notable horses sired by Lord Grosvenor's horse Justice, who during his racing career had won two races at Newmarket. Racing career =1794: three-year-old season= Daedalus made his first racecourse appearance in the Derby at Epsom on 5 June. Forty-nine horses had been entered for the race at 50 guineas each, but only four ran, including a stable companion of Daedalus who was not included in the betting. This four-horse field was the smallest in Derby history. The Duke of Bedford's Leon was the 4/5 favourite, with Lord Egremont's unnamed Highflyer colt (later named Ragged Jack) the 2/1 second choice and Daedalus starting at odds of 6/1. Ridden by Frank Buckle, Daedalus won from the Highflyer colt, with Leon third. Daedalus gave his owner a third Derby win in five years, while Buckle was recording the second of his five victories. After a break of four months, Daedalus returned to the racecourse for two runs at Newmarket in autumn. On 17 October he was one of three runners in a 100 guinea Sweepstakes over the two mile \\"Ditch In\\" course. Daedalus started favourite at odds of 4/6, but finished second at level weight to Mr Wilson's colt Bennington. Ten days later, Daedalus ran in another Sweepstakes over the same course and distance. On this occasion he started 5/2 second favourite and finished fourth of the six runners behind Bennington. At the end of the year Daedalus was sold to Mr. A Bayton and did not race again. Retirement Little is recorded of Daedalus after his sale to Mr. Bayton. He does not appear in any lists of stallions and has no progeny recorded in the General Stud Book which noted that he had been \\"sent to Russia.\\" In Russia, he was owned by Count Alexis Orlov, the brother of Gregory Orlov, who also imported the 1792 St. Leger winner Tartar.

Thus, the system can issue the smart cards, maintain the smart cards while in use and finally take the smart cards out of use (EOL). Chip/smart cards provide the foundation for secure electronic identity, and can be used to control access to facilities, networks or computers. As the smart cards are security credentials for authenticating the smart card holder (for example using two-factor authentication) the security requirements for a smart card management system are often high and therefore the vendors of these systems are found in the computer security industry. Smart card management systems are generally implemented as software applications. If the system needs to be accessible by more than one operator or user simultaneously (this is normally the case) the software application is often provided in the form of a server application accessible from several different client systems. An alternative approach is to have multiple synchronized systems. Smart card management systems connect smart cards to other systems. Which systems the smart card management system must connect to depends on the use case for the smart cards. Typical systems to connect to include: * Connected smart card reader * Unconnected (RFID) smart card reader * Card printer * User directory * Certificate authority * Hardware security module * Physical access control systems During the smart card lifecycle, the smart card is changing state (examples of such states include issued, blocked and revoked), the process of taking a smart card from one state to another, is the main responsibility of a smart card management system. Different smart card management systems call these processes by different names. Below a list of the most widely used names of the processes are listed and briefly explained: * Register – adding a smart card to the smart card management system * Issue – issuing or personalizing the smart card for a smart card holder * Initiate – activating the smart card for first use by the smart card holder * Deactivate – putting the smart card on hold in the backend system * Activate – reactivating the smart card from a deactivated state * Lock – also called block; smart card holder access to the smart card is not possible * Unlock – also called unblock; smart card holder access to the smart card is re-enabled * Revoke – credentials on the smart card are made invalid * Retire – the smart card is disconnected from the smart card holder * Delete – the smart card is permanently removed from the system * Unregister – the smart card is removed from the system (but could potentially be reused) * Backup - Backup smart card certificates and selected keys * Restore - Restore smart card certificates and selected keys Notes References * Schneier, Bruce (1996). \\"Applied Cryptography,\\" John Wiley & Sons Inc. * Rankl, Wolfgang & Effing, Wolfgang (2003). \\"Smart Card Handbook,\\" John Wiley & Sons Ltd * Wilson, Chuck (2001). \\"Get Smart,\\" Mullaney Publishing Group * Hansche, Susan & Berti, John & Hare Chris (2004). \\"Official (ISC)2 guide to the CISSP exam,\\" Auberbach Publications * Smart Card Industry Glossary from Smart Card Alliance Category:Smart cards Category:Public-key cryptography Category:Computer security Category:Computer network security ","title":"Smart card management system"},{"id":"34556167","text":"thumb Sławomir Lachowski (born 1 January 1958 in Końskie, Poland) is a Polish manager and economist who works in the banking industry in Poland and Central and Eastern Europe.

Biography His father, Elias Nason (born at Walpole, Massachusetts, in 1768; died at Easthampton, Massachusetts, in 1853), was a manufacturer of straw and cotton goods, a merchant, and served his town, Foxborough, as justice of the peace and as representative in the Massachusetts General Court. The family moved to North Bridgewater (now Brockton) when Henry Bradford was 10. Having attended school for a short time at Newburyport, Massachusetts, Henry Bradford entered the Adelphian Academy at North Bridgewater in 1843, where his attention was drawn to the study of natural science, and he began to make collections of the local minerals. He entered Williston Seminary in December 1847, where his taste for natural science grew; he also became interested in chemistry, and enriched his collections of plants and minerals. Nason pursued his studies further at Amherst College. There, he visited the interesting geological points in the Connecticut River Valley, and, under the guidance of Professor Shepard, he spent most of his vacations in the mineralogically rich regions of western Massachusetts and Connecticut, making many of his expeditions on foot or on horseback. He studied analytical chemistry under Professor Clark, and assisted him in the preparations for his lectures. He graduated from Amherst in 1855. Nason then studied chemistry at the University of Göttingen, Germany, where in 1857 he received the degree of Ph.D. for his original investigations on the formation of ethers. At Göttingen he also became a member of the Burschenschaft Hannovera (fraternity):de:Burschenschaft Hannovera Göttingen. He afterward spent some time with Robert Bunsen at the University of Heidelberg, and with Karl Friedrich Plattner at the Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg. He enriched his collections with many specimens of minerals and of art. On his return to the United States in 1858, Nason was appointed professor of natural history at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York, and in the same year he became professor of chemistry and natural sciences in Beloit College, holding both of these appointments until 1866. He then became professor of chemistry and natural science at RPI. In 1860, he made a second visit to Europe, and made a tour of geological study in the southern United States. In the next year, he traveled through Ireland, Scotland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and a part of Germany, and spent a semester in Göttingen in the study of geology and mineralogy, under Waltershausen. He then visited and studied the volcanic regions of Italy, ascended Mount Vesuvius, explored the regions of the solfatara, climbed Mount Etna, examined the glaciers of Switzerland and the configuration of the Alpine regions; and, in France, inspected the natural curiosities of the Puy-de-Dôme. In 1872 and 1875 he made three visits to California, in the course of which he traveled in Nevada and Idaho, and the mining regions of Colorado and Utah, and included in his third trip the Yosemite Valley. He spent the summer of 1877 in Finland and Russia. He was appointed juror by U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes for the Paris Exposition of 1878, and was assigned the department of mineralogy and metallurgy. From 1880 to 1890, he was an advising chemist for the Standard Oil Company. There he worked on the refining of petroleum, methods of testing, analysis of the composition of crude oils, and the abatement of nuisances arising from smoke, odors, and other products of refineries. That year Nason received the degree of M.D. from Union College, and the degree of LL.D. from Beloit College. In 1881 the New York State Board of Health selected him to be inspector of petroleum oils, and appointed him as commissioner to London to consider methods of dealing with petroleum nuisances. Another visit to northern Europe, in the summer of 1884, embraced the fjords and glaciers of Norway, and was extended to the North Cape. In 1887, Nason was appointed director of Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York. Nason was a member of the chemical societies of Berlin and New York, and in 1878 he was made a fellow of the London Chemical Society. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Society of Chemical Industry; a member of the American Chemical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and the Troy Scientific Association; an honorary member of the Albany Institute; and a member of the Norwegian Trekking Association. From 1872 to 1886, he was secretary of the General Alumni Association of RPI. As such, his books of 1875 and 1887 were prepared. Nason hall, an undergraduate residence hall at RPI, is named in his honor.

Overview The phrase was coined by Ian Williams to denote \\"the intersection between the medium of comics and the discourse of healthcare\\". Comics offer an engaging, powerful, and accessible method of delivering illness narratives. The academic appraisal of graphic fiction is in its infancy, but its examination by academics involved in healthcare-related studies is increasing, with work emerging in journals such as Configurations: A Journal of Literature, Science, and Technology (2.2) as well as Journal of the Medical Humanities and Literature and Medicine. It is notable that the Medical Humanities movement in many medical schools advocates the framework and use of literature in exploring illness, from practitioner and patient perspectives. A recent entry to the scholarly study of graphic medicine is the Einstein Foundation funded project at the Freie Universität Berlin (2016-2019) under the direction of Irmela Marei Krüger-Fürhoff and with the collaboration of Susan Merrill Squier, Einstein Visiting Fellow and Brill Professor at the Pennsylvania State University: PathoGraphics, the study of illness narratives or pathographies and works of graphic medicine. Williams set up the Graphic Medicine website in 2007 while writing a masters dissertation on medical narrative in comics and graphic novels, during which time he found Susan M. Squier's essays, “Beyond nescience: the intersectional insights of health humanities”, and “So Long as They Grow Out of It: Comics, The Discourse of Developmental Normalcy, and Disability\\". Scholars from around the world who were interested in comics and healthcare began to get in touch, notably Prof Michael Green, who had recently set up a graphic narratives course at Hershey Medical School at Penn State University, and MK Czerwiec, aka \\"Comic Nurse\\", who had, for many years, been recording her experiences as an HIV hospice nurse in comics form. Green invited his colleagues Kimberley Myers, of the Medical Humanities Program at Penn State Milton Hershey Medical School and Susan M. Squier, Brill Professor of English and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, who teaches graphic medicine to Ph.D. students at the Penn State University and whose work Williams had encountered earlier, to the discussion group, and Williams introduced Maria Vaccarella, Giskin Day and Columba Quigley. The group decided to hold a conference, in 2010 at The University of London, which led to a series of annual international conferences with presentations that are frequently posted as podcasts after the conference. Penn State University Press published The Graphic Medicine Manifesto in 2015. Authors are MK Czerwiec, Ian Williams, Susan Merrill Squier, Michael J. Green, Kimberly R. Myers, and Scott T. Smith. Content summary: \\"Combining scholarly essays with visual narratives and a conclusion in comics form, establishes graphic medicine as a new area of scholarship. Demonstrates that graphic medicine narratives offer patients, family members, and medical caregivers new ways to negotiate the challenges of the medical experience. Discusses comics as visual rhetoric\\"—Provided by publisher.; 195 pages, includes bibliographic references. This was the inaugural volume in the ongoing Graphic Medicine series at Penn State University Press, which is co-edited by Susan M. Squier and Ian Williams. In 2014, the first American Library Association Will Eisner Graphic Novel Growth Grant was awarded to Ypsilanti District Library, (Ypsilanti, Michigan) for its proposal to build a collection of graphic medicine narratives. To date, that collection contains over 300 titles. Author MK Czerwiec lectured in the fall of 2014 at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital (Ypsilanti, Michigan) in support of this grant. In 2018, the U.S. National Library of Medicine launched an exhibition, Graphic Medicine: Ill-Conceived and Well Drawn! and a video, A Conversation about Graphic Medicine. The exhibition includes a special display, traveling banner exhibition, and online exhibition.

He specialises in painting and drawing, but is also involved in writing and movie making. Typical are his comic like painting style and his attention for his outlines. The artist =Childhood= Zandvliet grew up in the neighborhood Delfshaven in the Dutch harbor city Rotterdam. During this time Delfshaven was considered to be a multicultural neighborhood, something that influenced Zandvliet a lot in his later art work. This shows in his technique, but also in the themes he uses. After primary school Zandvliet attended the graphic career school (from 1983 until 1987), which wasn't a big success. In an interview he once claimed that he got into a fight with the school director and got suspended. He decided to attend the Public Academy, to specialize in model drawing and fashion. (From 1988 until 1991) =Freelook magazine= In 1992 Zandvliet started, together with his wife, Freelook magazine. This magazine was a project intended for the youth in the neighborhood Delfshaven, in Rotterdam. The editors of the magazine were all local youngsters. Pieter mostly was busy with making comics for the magazine, but also published his own comic albums. Most of them were about the Rotterdam street life. Besides this he became editor in chief of the magazine. =Galerie Slaphanger= In 1994, also with his wife, Zandvliet started the gallery Galerie Slaphanger. This was a small gallery with mostly exhibitions of amateur artists. Also this gallery became a selling point for self published comics and music. After moving to a new building the self-published products became more important. From all over the world people sent their self made and self-published art to Gallery Slaphanger. The gallery became a stronghold for underground music, noise, literature, art and comics. Small concerts were organised, poetry nights, lectures, exhibitions, movie nights and a festival called \\"het plaatendraaiersfestival\\" (The record player festival) where people could bring their own old records and play them for the visitors. Galerie Slaphanger stopped existing in 2003. Artists exhibiting in the gallery were, among others: Chris Berg, Tom Oomes, Eddy de Waal, Bas van Tuyl AKA Bombastus, Marc van Elburg, Koen Hottentot, Nar=me, SAGE art, Sjef Henderickx, Itam van Teeseling, Arjen de Jong, Monique Veldhoven, Damy van der Waal, Rocket Freudenthal, Timex, Joost Geertsma, Jan Tromper, Jollen van der Zwan, Tommy de Roos, Daan van Eijndhoven, Guido Jelsma, Jason Austin, Marc Dancey, Maaike Hartjes, Barbara Stok, Anja Ranja, Wilco Wenrich, Koen Kuijpers, Claudio Parentella, Maria Colino and many others. The art =Melt Art= Zandvliet experimented a lot with different types of media. In 1994, for the first time, he had a solo exhibition in Galerie Slaphanger with his 'melt art'. These were art works made of melted plastic (mostly Barbie dolls) melted on wood, transformed into a surreal three dimensional painting, finalized with aerosols. =Comics= Zandvliet started his career as a cartoonist for Freelook magazine, also he published a few comic books on his own. The theme of his cartoons mostly was the street life of Rotterdam. =Painting= Zandvliet started focussing on painting in 1998. In this year he was chosen by curator Koos van Duinen to take part in art show 'De Dubbelkamer', in Schiedam. There he won the audience award and the encouragement award for young artists. He sold five of the nine exposed paintings. In 1999 Zandvliet participated in a group exhibition called 'je weet niet wat je ziet' (you don't know what you are seeing), in the Municipal Museum of Schiedam. Here he made a mural and exposed a movie in where he plays himself as a painting freak. In 2001 Zandvliet painted, in commission of Julia Snikkers (formal director of the Artoteek Schiedam) a roll-down shutter and connected an exhibition to it in the Artoteek (place where people can rent art). In the same year he painted a mural in Pand Paulus, an exhibition hall in Schiedam. And in 2004 mayor Scheeres of Schiedam opened the exhibition 'Salsa and Tulips'. This was a duo exhibition together with Texan artist Joan Fabian. After this Zandvliet began orientating more internationally and did exhibitions in Spain, the USA, Poland, Italy, Thailand, Iran, Russia, Portugal and Venezuela. Method Zandvliet puts his outlines directly on the canvas, or paper. He doesn't sketch out his idea, but likes to make his work like a journey. He never knows how the final work will going to be. Lines are important for him. With the lines he expresses the feeling in the figure that he draws. The colors he uses are psychedelic and contrasting. The last exhibition in Schiedam, for he left for Overijssel in late 2008, was the exhibition ' conflict ', in which the two artists entered into a duel on canvas. Zandvliet did this with the Icelandic artist Didrik Jon Kristofersson. In 2006, zandvliet together with Frank van der Donk and Ivanna Urbanova Whale Art shop in the Centre of Schiedam set up, for which he also designed the logo. In 2011, he participated in the Twente Biennale Hengelo and he exhibited in the art house Secretary in Meppel, the Netherlands. One of the two other artists who exhibited there was the equally from the Randstad moved Rene Virgin mountain. The two artists have made multiple together work together under the name Piers eaters. In 2012 Zandvliets art hung on the wall of the exhibition Lecheria Pop Art in the Museo Museo Dimitrios Demu Venezuela. Zandvliet exhibited in 2013 in La sala Tarragona Catalonia, Spain to Amposta. In 2014, he painted shoes Mascolori shoes in Command of Rotterdam. He designed the logo of the beach fashion clothing label Viva Lola from Miami. 2015 he Exposseerde in the Outsider Art Gallery Amsterdam and he participated in Emerged an exhibit with contemporary Dutch Pop art artists in the Zandvoorts museum. 2016 came to Mascolori the Outline shoe from designed by Pieter Zanvliet and three pairs of stockings. He also designed the cover of Bacon Fat louis, and he released his own shirt label FACE Clothes. 2017 came a shoe out of Pieter zandvliet at Mascolori, the Pieter zandvliet in a small print run of 50 pairs. and the Football shoe designed by z. For The SOTU to festival of Amstedam zandvliet designed shirts. For the Amsterdam-based Brewer Butchers tears, he designed a label. By the Agentijnse filmmakers Flor Scarano and Cecilia Garizoain work is ongoing on the docemantaire,\\"Maybe I should draw\\"\\" about zandvliet aimed at film festivals. 2018, Zandvliet's third shoe came out for Mascolori, which is called Pieter Zandvliet. Hard art was an exhibition with work by friends Hein Dingemans and Pieter Zandvliet in Atelier / gallery Herenplaats in Rotterdam. For an exhibition about the Settlers in the former Ommerschans Colony, Pieter made portraits of old black and white photos of Settlers who were exposed at the sculpture garden Witharen in Witharen, where they will also be on display in 2019. In the Cult gallery in Raalte, Pieter exhibited a series of portraits made by the Raaltener artist Bram de Krosse and Zandvliet. Clothing brand Wolff Blitz brought a shirt on the market with a print by Pieter Zandvliet. 2019 this year did not start pleasantly with the death of friend Bram de Krosse, who was only 33 years old. A fourth shoe designed for Mascolori, the Pieter Zandvliet 2.0, was released. With the Teekenclub a group of artist friends, Zandvliet painted the Bar wall of his neighbor Rolf Dunnink.

The PRCA aims to raise standards in the PR and communications industry by sharing industry data, information, and best practices, as well as creating networking opportunities. History It was founded in 1969 (as the Public Relations Consultants Association), and was originally an organisation for PR agencies; its membership includes 400 agency members, including most of the top 100 UK consultancies; over 100 in-house communications teams from multinationals, UK charities and public sector organisations. The PRCA launched in-house membership in February 2009 and individual membership in October 2011. In 2001, the PRCA sought a meeting with the Financial Services Authority to develop a code of practice for financial PR consultants. The PRCA was one of three organisations which founded the UK lobbying self-regulation body, the UK Public Affairs Council, in 2010 - alongside the Association of Professional Political Consultants and the Chartered Institute of Public Relations. However, the PRCA resigned from the UKPAC the following year, in December 2011. It changed its name to the Public Relations and Communications Association in August 2016. The PRCA expelled Bell Pottinger in September 2017 after a disciplinary hearing found that a secret campaign by the company to spread racial hatred in South Africa was the worst-ever breach of ethics by a member company. Francis Ingham, the PRCA's director-general, said: \\"the PRCA has never before passed down such a damning indictment of an agency’s behaviour,\\" and condemning the campaign, which incited racial hatred, as \\"absolutely unthinkable\\".

It is a translation of a play written by the Latin comedy writer Terence, who had originally taken it from the Greek dramatist Menander. It is one of the examples of Machiavelli as a comedy writer, along with The Mandrake and the Clizia. The play has been considered by some scholars semi- autobiographical. Story The story is about an old man, Simone, who wants his son, Panfilo, to marry Filumena, the daughter of his neighbour Cremete. Panfilo has, however, a secret love affair with Glicerio, a girl who is thought to be the sister of Criside, and who is pregnant by him. At Criside's funeral the old Simone gets to know about this secret. Suspecting Panfilo's love for Glicerio, Cremete breaks off the marriage contract. Simone doesn't want to let Panfilo know, in order to test Panfilo's loyalty. The young boy doesn't want to forsake Glicerio, but pretends to go along with the wedding. Meanwhile, Cremete changes his mind and proceeds to renew the marriage contract. But then it comes to the old Critone, a friend of the deceased Criside, who recognizes Glicerio as Pasibula. Pasibula was Cremete's daughter, who was thought to have died in a shipwreck during a travel to the island of Andros. In the end there are two weddings: Panfilo marries Glicerio, and Carino, a friend of his, marries Filumena. Production history The Andria remained untranslated for the English stage until a limited run of Michael Knowles' translation, The Girl from Andros, was produced at Yale University in April 2012. At the time of production, Machiavelli scholar Angela Capodivacca observed: \\"The new translation and performance of the Andria is hopefully going to open new ways of inquiry and thinking about the relationship between Machiavelli and translation, Machiavelli and theatre, and, last but not least, Machiavelli's understanding of the phenomenology of the political sphere. This production is a watershed event for the English-speaking world\\".

Originally discovered for sound waves in the whispering gallery of St Paul’s Cathedral, they can exist for light and for other waves, with important applications in nondestructive testing, lasing, cooling and sensing, as well as in astronomy. Introduction Snapshot of an acoustic whispering-gallery mode calculated at a frequency of 69 Hz in an enclosed cylinder of air of the same diameter (33.7 m) as the whispering gallery in St Paul’s Cathedral. Red and blue represent higher and lower air pressures, respectively, and the distortions in the grid lines show the displacements. In the case of the waves travelling one way round the gallery, the air particles move in elliptical trajectories. Whispering-gallery waves were first explained for the case of St Paul's Cathedral circa 1878[Lord Rayleigh, Theory of Sound, vol. II, 1st edition, (London, MacMillan), 1878.] by Lord Rayleigh, who revised a previous misconception[J. Tyndall, The Science of Sound (New York, Philosophical Library), 1867, p. 20.][G. B. Airy, On Sound and Atmospheric Vibrations, with the Mathematical Elements of Music (London, MacMillan), 1871, p. 145.] that whispers could be heard across the dome but not at any intermediate position. He explained the phenomenon of travelling whispers with a series of specularly reflected sound rays making up chords of the circular gallery. Clinging to the walls the sound should decay in intensity only as the inverse of the distance — rather than the inverse square as in the case of a point source of sound radiating in all directions. This accounts for the whispers being audible all round the gallery. Rayleigh developed wave theories for St Paul’s in 1910 and 1914. Fitting sound waves inside a cavity involves the physics of resonance based on wave interference; the sound can exist only at certain pitches as in the case of organ pipes. The sound forms patterns called modes, as shown in the diagram. Many other monuments have been shown to exhibit whispering-gallery waves, such as the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. In the strict definition of whispering-gallery waves, they cannot exist when the guiding surface becomes straight.[L. M. Brekhovskikh, Sov. Phys. Acoust. 13, 462, 1968] Mathematically this corresponds to the limit of an infinite radius of curvature. Whispering-gallery waves are guided by the effect of the wall curvature. Acoustic waves Whispering-gallery waves for sound exist in a wide variety of systems. Examples include the vibrations of the whole Earth[Quantitative Seismology, K. Aki and P. G. Richards (University Science Books), 2009, Ch. 8] or stars. Such acoustic whispering-gallery waves can be used in nondestructive testing in the form of waves that creep around holes filled with liquid, for example. They have also been detected in solid cylinders and spheres, with applications in sensing, and visualized in motion on microscopic discs . Whispering gallery waves are more efficiently guided in spheres than in cylinders because the effects of acoustic diffraction (lateral wave spreading) are then completely compensated. Electromagnetic waves Optical whispering-gallery modes in a glass sphere of diameter 300 μm experimentally imaged with a fluorescence technique. The tip of an angle-cut optical fiber, visible on the right, excites the modes in the red region of the optical spectrum. Whispering-gallery waves exist for light waves. They have been produced in microscopic glass spheres or tori, for example, with applications in lasing, optomechanical cooling, frequency comb generation and sensing. The light waves are almost perfectly guided round by optical total internal reflection, leading to Q factors in excess of 1010 being achieved. This is far greater than the best values, about 104, that can be similarly obtained in acoustics. Optical modes in a whispering gallery resonator are inherently lossy due to a mechanism similar to quantum tunneling. As a result, light inside a whispering gallery mode experiences a degree of radiation loss even in theoretically ideal conditions. Such a loss channel has been known from research on optical waveguide theory and is dubbed tunneling ray attenuation in the field of fiber optics. The Q factor is proportional to the decay time of the waves, which in turn is inversely proportional to both the surface scattering rate and the wave absorption in the medium making up the gallery. Whispering-gallery waves for light have been investigated in chaotic galleries, whose cross-sections deviate from a circle. And such waves have been used in quantum information applications. Whispering-gallery waves have also been demonstrated for other electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, microwaves, terahertz radiation, infrared radiation, ultraviolet waves and x-rays. Other systems Whispering-gallery waves have been seen in the form of matter waves for neutrons, and electrons, and they have been proposed as an explanation for vibrations of a single nucleus. Whispering gallery waves have also been observed in the vibrations of soap films as well as in the vibrations of thin plates Analogies of whispering-gallery waves also exist for gravitational waves at the event horizon of black holes. A hybrid of waves of light and electrons known as surface plasmons has been demonstrated in the form of whispering-gallery waves, and likewise for exciton-polaritons in semiconductors. Galleries simultaneously containing both acoustic and optical whispering-gallery waves have also been made, exhibiting very strong mode coupling and coherent effects. Hybrid solid-fluid-optical whispering-gallery structures have been observed as well.

The FIVB then conducted an investigation into whether the Japanese women's team deliberately lost against Serbia before concluding that there was no evidence to prove the existence of match fixing. =Background= Before the controversial match Japan had gained 11 points to put them in 5th place, while Serbia had 12 points placing them 3rd. } For the last game, the qualification outcome could be fallen into one of these three scenarios. * If Japan beats Serbia by any score, then Japan and Thailand (as the best Asian team) will qualify. * If Japan is beaten by 0–3 or 1–3, then Serbia and Thailand (as the best Asian team) will qualify. * If Japan is beaten by 2–3, then Serbia and Japan (as the best Asian team) will qualify. =Match details and consequences= In the 1st set, Japan took an 8–5 edge at the first technical time out. After that Serbia leveled the score at 10–10. Erika Araki spiked to let Japan led 16–14 at the second TTO and then drilled a spike right down the middle to give Japan the set 25–18. Serbia returned to claim the 2nd set 21–25. Japan came back on the 3rd set with a 10-point lead, then 16–6, 18–8, 20–10 and 22–12 before closing the set 25–19. After the 3rd set, Japan had qualified for 2012 Summer Olympics, so they didn't have to play seriously. However in the 4th set, Japan was up 19–16 before Serbia made 6 consecutive points, ending with a win for Serbia at 21–25. After the match, Masayoshi Manabe, coach of Japan, released a statement. > We knew this was the last day. Everybody was nervous. We knew we had to get > two sets. Yoshie Takeshita is ill from mental and physical exhaustion after > this match. We told the players at the morning meeting that we had to give > it full power tonight. We have to work on our serve reception in the two > months leading up to the Olympics. Serbia's win also meant it qualified ahead of Thailand, which aimed to reach the Olympics for the first time. Had Japan beaten Serbia, Thailand would have also won a ticket to London along with Japan. But, in this case, Japan would have been placed in a tough group in London alongside defending champions Brazil, the world number-one United States, Asian champions China and the new European force Turkey. Thai captain, Wilavan Apinyapong, was disappointed but said that the Olympic Games remained their ultimate dream and everything. =Investigation= On May 28, 2012, the day after the match, the FIVB by Wei Jizhong released this statement > The FIVB has investigated the allegation of match fixing. The conclusion of > the FIVB control committee in place is that there is no evidence to prove > the existence of match fixing. The reports received from the national > federations of Japan and Serbia told us the same. Some witnesses in > attendance at the match gave the same judgement. The FIVB also said that it stood firmly against match fixing and would revise the system of future Olympics qualifiers to reduce even further the possibility of any manipulation. =Reaction= Some media suspected the investigation result and said that something didn’t seem right. Thai social media sites were bombarded with messages expressing dissatisfaction over the judgement and a Japanese volleyball official insisted that the allegation was unfounded.

History Known as one of the \\"second-generation\\" of Pre-Raphaelites, Stanhope was among Dante Gabriel Rossetti's mural-painting party at the Oxford Union in 1857, together with Arthur Hughes, John Hungerford Pollen, Valentine Prinsep, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. He was a founder member of the Hogarth Club, a direct descendant of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.A.M.W. Stirling, \\"The Life of Roddam Spencer Stanhope, Pre-Raphaelite, a Painter of Dreams,\\" in A Painter of Dreams and Other Biographical Studies (London: Lane, 1916). This painting is considered one of Stanhope's best, and represents two radically different artistic phases of his life. Although he began as fervently Pre-Raphaelite in outlook, Stanhope was deeply attracted by the Aesthetic movement during the 1860s. Love and the Maiden is a succinct mingling of these two equally formative phases in his career. Its presence in the 1877 exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery — Aestheticism's most famous exposé — demonstrates his adherence to the latter movement, whereas the painting's similarity to the work of Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti - the group of dancing women in the background are similar to those portrayed by Rossetti in The Bower Meadow (1871–72) - betray Stanhope's Pre-Raphaelite background. During his time in Oxford in 1857, Stanhope wrote that he spent most days painting with Burne-Jones;Jane A. Munro, \\"'This Hateful Letter-Writing': Selected Correspondence of Sir Edward Burne-Jones in the Huntington Library\\", Huntington Library Quarterly 55 (1992). Cf. also V. Schuster, \\"The Pre- Raphaelites in Oxford,\\" Oxford Art Journal 1 (1978). possibly as a result of this, a great deal of Burne-Jones' influence can be seen in his work - although it could be argued that Burne-Jones also drew ideas from Stanhope's work. The androgynous physiques, Grecian-style draperies and facial expressions depicted in Love and the Maiden are classic Burne-Jones hallmarks, even though the facial similarities probably also arose from use of the same models.T.

Vaccinium myrsinites. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Vaccinium myrsinites is an erect, branching shrub that reaches one meter (40 inches) in maximum height. It is rhizomatous and can form very large colonies. Colonies measuring one kilometer (0.63 miles ) across and over 1,000 years old have been observed. It is generally evergreen, but some forms are deciduous. The stems have angular green twigs. The leathery, green or grayish green, oval leaves are up to roughly one centimeter (0.4 inches) long and have smooth or vaguely toothed edges. The undersides are glandular. The flowers are urn- shaped or cylindrical, white to pink or red-tinged, and borne in clusters of up to 8. They may be nearly one centimeter long. The fruit is a black or waxy blue berry up to 8 or 9 millimeters in length containing several seeds.Flora of North America, Vaccinium myrsinites Lamarck 1783. Shiny blueberry . Vaccinium myrsinites grows in several habitat types in the southeastern U.S., including prairies, pine barrens, bog margins, flatwoods, Florida scrub, palmetto communities, and rosemary balds. It also grows in disturbed, clearcut, and fallow cultivated areas. Associated plants include scrub palmetto, netted pawpaw, scrubclover, dodder, Florida blazingstar, scrub mint, tree sparkleberry, saw palmetto, Lyonia, dwarf huckleberry, inkberry, bracken fern, several oaks, many species of pine. The best sites are dry, sandy stretches of acidic soils in full sunlight. In common with many southeastern scrub species, this plant is fire-adapted. It can recover from a fire by sprouting from its rhizome. This is also the way it forms vast colonies of cloned individuals. The plant also reproduces sexually by seed. The seeds are dispersed by animals, which relish the fruits. Vaccinium myrsinites is likely a hybrid of two other blueberry species, small cluster blueberry and Darrow's evergreen blueberry. Individuals may resemble one or the other parent species; the \\"darrowoid\\" phase is more common in coastal Florida, while the \\"tenneloid\\" phase can be found in southern Georgia and northern Florida. This species also hybridizes with many other blueberries.

He is best known for his work in house and techno that he produces under his Radio Slave moniker. He has also released under a variety of different aliases including Cabin Fever, Canvas, DJ Maxxi, The Machine, REKID, Seadevils and Quiet Village. He is also co- founder of London-based record label Rekids, which he formed in 2006 with James Masters. Rekids is also mother label to the REK'D and Pyramids of Mars imprints. Career Edwards' career began as a DJ in London and Aberystwyth, where he picked up a residency at the Milk Bar in 1992 and Aberystwyth football club. He would then go on to become resident at the legendary Ministry of Sound. He has since gone on to DJ all over the world, visiting virtually every major club, including Fabric (London), Cocoon (Frankfurt), Womb (Tokyo), Space (Ibiza), Robert Johnson (Frankfurt), The Arches (Glasgow), Trouw (Amsterdam) Spank (Aberystwyth football club) and many more. Edwards is consistently touring throughout the year and currently holds residencies at Berlin's Panorama Bar and Paris' Rex Club with the Rekids club nights. Radio Slave began in 2000 as a duo remixing project with Serge Santiago. As a pair Matt and Serge produced bootleg club remixes of songs by Busta Rhymes, Kylie Minogue, Limp Bizkit, Nancy Sinatra and many more pop artists. Around 2002, Serge left to pursue his own musical path leaving Edwards in control of the Radio Slave guise. He continued to produce a string of remixes for well- established artists, before finally releasing his own original material in 2006. From this point onwards, Edwards continued to release his own music, mostly through his own label Rekids, as well as remixing more underground electronic artists. In recent years, he has also released a number of different mix CDs including Fabric 48 and Strictly Rhythm Vol. 5. As Radio Slave, Edwards is yet to release a full-length LP. However he has released albums of original material as The Machine, REKID and Quiet Village (with Joel Martin). The Machine is a multi-media venture combining music and visuals. The aural aspect features 6 tracks of experimental soundscapes – using found sounds and taking influence from contemporary electro-acoustic composition. The visual aspect comprises a short film by UK artists Lovely Jon & Mike Keelin, and each track has a corresponding image designed by Australian pop artist Misha Hollenbach. The music is available on CD and vinyl as The Machine's LP 'RedHead' and was released in 2010. The second track Opening Ceremony (Fuse) also appeared on Berlin imprint Innervisions in 2009 remixed by Ame and Dixon. As Quiet Village, Edwards released full-length LP 'Silent Movie' on Studio !K7 in 2008. The album was released on both vinyl and CD and focusses on more downtempo, left field music with balearic influences. As REKID, Matt released 14-track album 'Made in Menorca' in 2006 on Soul Jazz Records. The album was released on vinyl as well as CD and takes influence from disco music and deep house. In 2011 he collaborated with Japanese toy maker Devilrobots to create a Rekids-themed toy 'No Sleep No Tofu'. The toy is a Japanese Kubrick figure produced by MediCom – a small, limited edition collector's item with a block-style human form similar to Playmobil or Lego. The head of the figure is a detachable block which features the sleeve design for REKIDS036 – Radio Slave – No Sleep (Part Six). In May 2012, Edwards released a sample pack with label Sample Magic. The pack features 500MB of percussive and musical loops, hits and effects, designed to be used as tools for electronic music producers. 2012 also saw the launch the 'Pyramids of Mars' label – a multimedia project that incorporates various strands of artistic disciplines. The 2010 album RedHead (under his 'Machine' pseudonym) was re-issued on Pyramids of Mars as part of a deluxe package, including a re- interpretation of the full album by Joe Claussell. The boxset was limited to 50 copies, each hand-painted by Misha Hollenbach, and included triple-vinyl pressings of both Claussell's and Edwards' versions.

It is a road-documentary in which Americans' are asked about the financial crisis of the late 2000s and the disconnect with the political elite. They relate their thoughts, their emotions and especially their solutions to fix America’s financial problems.  Plot  Fixing America is a journey across the byways of America interviewing citizens who offer solutions to fix America's problems. Fixing America claims that the “ordinary” American people are those most suited to disentangle problems and crucial issues, saying that they are the ones who deal with complexity everyday, struggling to make ends meet and put their children through college. In this documentary the interviewees offer simple ideas, without conveying the need for simplicity. They refer to the forefathers, the Constitution, and historical events during America's history. The documentary includes appearances from scholars such as professors Lawrence Kotlikoff, John Friar, and Khalil Habib; journalists such as Dylan Ratigan and Louie Free and activists such as Lew Ward, Grover Norquist, Steve Forbes, Robert Scott, Ned Ryun, and Scott Paul.  Production  225x225px Fixing America was conceived by financial expert Steve Laffey, the two-term former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island. Laffey improvises himself as a journalist along with a crew of ten, and talent that includes director Anthony Ambrosino, director of photography Jeff Hoffman, editor Fred Tindall, and original music by Mauro Colangelo. Produced by Steve Laffey and creative and business partner Stephen Skoly, the documentary was shot in 18 states and the District of Columbia in April and May 2011, traveling on the back roads and byways of America from Fort Collins, Colorado to Washington DC to New England. Twenty-one independent contractors worked on the film over 10 months in 2011. The production was self-financed by the Executive Producers, Steve Skoly and Steve Laffey, and did not accept public money or grants; it had no co-production partners or any associations with broadcasters, production companies or political organizations.  Background  In January 2011, Steve Laffey was working on a media plan for an Internet TV and radio business that would reproduce the quality of direct, one-on-one communication with people he had been able to experience in the last few years during his numerous trips across America. His business plan drew on his interest in establishing a more personal relationship with the American people, meeting them head-on and discussing heart-to-heart matters, while sharing ideas. While drafting the plan, word reached two individuals Laffey had never met, Scott \\"Boss\\" Hogg and Barry Hinckley, who invited him to the Sundance Film Festival to talk about it. During an interview with \\"Boss\\" and Barry on Revolution Radio, he happened to be sitting next to J.C. Chandor who had just finished making the movie Margin Call. Listening to J.C. Chandor, Laffey believed that making a grassroots documentary film featuring the American people frankly voicing solutions would be a better first step to help fix America. He contacted Stephen Skoly, producer and founder of JawDoc Productions, who knew Laffey’s grassroots background – as evidenced by his campaigns for Mayor and the U.S. Senate and as portrayed in Joe Klein’s Time Magazine Article Running Against The Big Shots and Laffey’s own book, Primary Mistake (Penguin Books 2007) – and was interested in participating in the making of a populist movie, intended to show how regular folks know better than the political elite. Together they formed Fixing America LLC, in Colorado.

The episode was co-written by Robert Chiappetta, Alison Schapker, Monica Owusu-Breen, and Glen Whitman. Joe Chappelle directed the hour. Plot When Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) realizes that Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) is experiencing memories from the Olivia of his original timeline, he convinces her to allow his father Walter (John Noble) to examine her. They find nothing immediately wrong with her brain, but Walter takes some hair samples for testing. With Olivia out of earshot, Walter scolds Peter in the belief that Peter is—perhaps unintentionally—empathizing his memories onto Olivia, who as a child was highly emotionally attuned to others. The Fringe division learns of a case of a teenager, Sean Martin (Harrison Thomas), in a mental institution who, while in a nighttime trance, reportedly related in perfect detail the distant murder of a reporter by three teenagers. Sean explains that he hears voices from \\"outside\\" his head, leading Walter to believe that some type of telepathy is involved. Sean's transcription of the voices he heard during the murder leads the team to a subway bathroom, where they discover blood from an assailant injured in the attack. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) stays with the boy as he is purposely taken off his medications, hoping to identify the voices that he hears. Analysis of the assailant's blood does not produce an identity, but Walter realizes that the sample shares a similar genetic anomaly with Sean's DNA, a trait that can only be shared by common ancestry. Olivia and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) learn from Sean's mother that Sean was conceived by in vitro fertilisation, and that the deceased reporter had called her a few days before, looking into the process. Walter concludes that Sean is reading the thoughts of other in vitro children that share the same genetic trait and are protecting themselves like animals in a hive. The team locates the doctor that performed the process, Dr. Owen Frank (John Aylward). Dr. Frank admits that he modified and donated samples of his own DNA to re-introduce instinctive traits into humans, attempting to build \\"a better human being\\". Walter recognizes that the children who share this trait are likely killing to prevent their genetically modified nature from becoming public. Dr. Frank provides Olivia and Peter with the location of his files, unaware that several of his progeny have already arrived there and are lying in wait. As Olivia and Peter discover the destroyed files, Olivia mentions information from the original timeline that Peter was not privy to, which means he can't be projecting his own memories on to her. Meanwhile, Sean hears voices plotting to ambush the duo, and Astrid is able to alert Olivia in time for her and Peter to defend themselves and capture their attackers. However, a second pair of teenagers suffocates Dr. Frank. With the doctor dead, Sean is no longer able to hear any voices, a situation he both welcomes and fears. Walter discovers from Olivia's hair samples that she has recently been given doses of Cortexiphan. He and Lincoln confront Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) and demand an inspection of Walter and William Bell's Cortexiphan samples, which were stored in Massive Dynamic's headquarters under biometric security measures. Nina shows them the vials, but Walter recognizes that the Cortexiphan inside has been replaced with food coloring, implicating Nina. After completing the case, Olivia and Peter stop at a gas station on their way home. Olivia discusses the lifestyle they had in Peter's timeline and he confesses that he can tell from her eyes that Olivia is the same as from his original timeline. After a brief kiss, Olivia leaves the car to use the restroom, but Peter discovers that she has disappeared. Elsewhere, Olivia regains consciousness tied up in a tiled room, along with a fatigued Nina tied to a chair opposite her, telling her that everything is all right. Production The teleplay for this episode was co-written by co-executive producers Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, based on a story by executive story editors Glen Whitman and Robert Chiappetta. It was directed by executive producer Joe Chappelle. Actress Blair Brown was unaware of the surprise surrounding her character Nina Sharp, whom she had played for a number of fourth season episodes, until she received the episode's script. She noted that it was a \\"great thrill\\" to read the script, and added \\"The way we work is the writers always have something in mind, and it’s always more fun to just wait and see what shows up.\\" Cultural references In the lab, when Dr. Walter Bishop is testing Olivia Dunham's DNA, the song being played in the background is Karen Elson's \\"The Ghost Who Walks\\" from the album of the same name. The instance of a fertility doctor using his own sperm to impregnate several of his patients is highly reminiscent of the case of Dr. Cecil Jacobson, who was accused of such practices and later convicted of perjury and had his medical license revoked. Reception =Ratings= \\"A Better Human Being\\" was first broadcast on February 17, 2012 in the United States on Fox. An estimated 3 million viewers watched the episode, marking a slight decrease in viewers from the previous episode. =Reviews= Entertainment Weekly columnist Jeff Jensen called the episode \\"a significant, clever, and on the whole compelling hour of season 4 Fringe.\\" He did complain however that \\"as the episode progressed, I felt the case-of-the-week was no longer complementing the Olivia storyline but distracting from it. More, it just didn’t seem plausible that Olivia would continue/would be permitted to continue working after being diagnosed with what a psychologist would call 'a psychotic episode.'... Yet again: I was entertained and engaged. I thought Allegedly Crazy Sean was a clever twist on the magical nutjob archetype, and I was intellectually and emotionally activated by Olivia’s life changing internal event, which begged various meaningful questions about the nature of identity and whatnot. And I thought the performances by Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson were just great. After a slow, slightly frustrating install, Fringe 4.0's reboot-oriented operating system is beginning to yield stories that are stimulating for being unique products of that premise.\\" References External links * \\"A Better Human Being\\" at Fox.com * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 4) episodes ","title":"A Better Human Being"},{"id":"34556628","text":"The target par excellence of Spanish irredentist claims has been the British overseas territory of Gibraltar whose long-standing territorial vindication as a (British) colony is enshrined in the Spanish foreign policy. Along history, other minor irredentist proposals have claimed territories such as Portugal, parts of Northern Africa or the Roussillon.  Iberian Union  Satellite image of the Iberian Peninsula. A Spain holding all of the Iberian Peninsula became a topic in Spanish nationalism beginning in the 19th century, with proponents idealizing historical Roman Hispania when all of the Iberian Peninsula was united under the same rule. The concept of Spain as a cultural and political unit had been developed centuries earlier with the publishing of Father Mariana's History of Spain (1598) in which Mariana supported a Hispanic identity. There has been strong Spanish objection to the separation of Gibraltar from Spain since British acquisition in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) in the aftermath of the Spanish War of Succession.Tibor Frank, Frank Hadler.

The years of World War II were fertile in the projection by several authors of irredentist imaginaries across the Strait of Gibraltar (after all the Strait was to become the \\"neuralgic point of nationality\\" to them): according to the africanist Tomás García Figueras \\"Spain and Morocco are like two halves of the same geographical unity\\". Historian Jaume Vicens Vives (1940) talked about a \\"vital space\\" conceptualised as a \\"geopolitical basic unit\\". Rodolfo Gil Benumeya traced the links back to the Neolithic, pointing to a common Ibero-Berber People living at both sides of the Strait. Gil Benumeya and Hernández Pacheco stressed the strengthening of those links due to Morocco being part of \\"Hispania Tingitana\\". Some of these authors, transcending historical arguments, even pointed at a Spanish-African union during \\"the Tertiary\\" when the Strait would not have existed. To a lesser extent the territories adjacent to Equatorial Guinea were also subject to irredentist rhetoric in this time, as well there were claims about the Spanishness of Andorra, the Roussillon, the Cerdanya or the Lower Navarre and the yearning for an approximation with Portugal.

It is the largest art exhibition in the country and the biggest contemporary art festival in Asia. The Kochi- Muziris Biennale is an initiative of the Kochi Biennale Foundation with support from the Government of Kerala. The concept of Kochi-Muziris Biennale was ideated and executed by Dr. Venu IAS, who was the culture Secretary, Government of Kerala The exhibition is set in spaces across Kochi, with shows being held in existing galleries, halls, and site-specific installations in public spaces, heritage buildings and disused structures. Indian and international artists exhibit artworks across a variety of mediums including film, installation, painting, sculpture, new media and performance art. Through the celebration of contemporary art from around the world, the Kochi- Muziris Biennale seeks to invoke the historic cosmopolitan legacy of the modern metropolis of Kochi, and its mythical predecessor, the ancient port of Muziris. Alongside the exhibition the Biennale offers a rich programme of talks, seminars, screenings, music, workshops and educational activities for school children and students. The second edition of the biennale cost about Rs 17 crore, slightly up from the Rs 16.5 crore spent on the first edition. The Kerala government’s contribution fell to Rs 3 crore from Rs 9 crore despite pleas for financial assistance. The organisers relied on sponsorship and online crowd funding for meeting the expenses. The number of visitors grew to five lakhs in the second edition, an increase of one lakh from the first edition. The Biennale was visited by more than six lakh people in its third edition.  The Birth of Kochi-Muziris Biennale  In May 2010, Mumbai based contemporary artists of Kerala origin, Bose Krishnamachari and Riyaz Komu, were approached by then culture minister of Kerala, M.A Baby to start an international art project in the state. Acknowledging the lack of an international platform for contemporary art in India, Bose and Riyas proposed the idea of a Biennale (a large scale international exhibition) in Kochi on the lines of the Venice Biennale. Kochi Biennale Foundation  The Kochi Biennale Foundation (KBF) is a non-profit charitable trust engaged in promoting art & culture and educational activities in India; primary amongst them the hosting of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. KBF works around the year to strengthen contemporary art infrastructure and to broaden public access to art across India. The Kochi Biennale Foundation is also engaged in the conservation of heritage properties and monuments and the upliftment of traditional forms of art and culture. KBF was founded in 2010 by artists Bose Krishnamachari and Riyas Komu .  First Kochi-Muziris Biennale  Aspinwall House, one of the main venues of the biennale The First Kochi-Muziris Biennale began on 12 December 2012. The Biennale hosted 80 artists with nearly 50 percent foreign artists, site-specific works and a sustained education programme in the three months. As a run-up to the event, in April, the Durbar Hall Kochi will host German modern artist Eberhard Havekost's exhibition \\"Sightseeing Trip\\", held in collaboration with Dresden State Art Collections. The Aspinwall House exhibits the art works of 44 artists spread across the premises. Entry was free till 23 December which was then replaced by ticketed entry at Rs.50 to help pay for daily running costs. According to artist and Kochi-Muziris Biennale artistic director Bose Krishnamachari support has come in many forms. Shalini and Sanjay Passi held a INR 25,000-per-head dinner in the capital to raise funds, raising . Google met with the foundation and has offered help with the website, which received 7.5 million hits in the first month. The Jindals of Jindal Steel and Power Limited, the late Kerala Congress leader T.M. Jacob, R.K. Krishna Kumar of Tata group, Jayanta Matthews of Malayala Manorama and the businessman Shibu Mathai have all donated. The sites for the Kochi-Muziris Biennale were: # Aspinwall House # David Hall # Pepper House # Moidu's Heritage # Durbar Hall # Cabral Yard # Parade Ground # Fort Kochi beach # Kashi Art Gallery # Jew Town Road Godown # Rose Street Bungalow # Cochin Club # Gallery OED https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday- review/art/a-brush-with-new-colours/article5192998.ece # David Horvitz Reactions and Controversies According to Tate Modern, Kochi-Muziris Biennale was the best biennale they had ever seen. The biennale accrued 150,000 visitors in its first month and 250,000 visitors in its second, averaging a thousand visitors a day (as high as 5,000 daily and 10,000 on weekends, early January). Local people have stepped up, on an individual level, realising what the biennale has done for them, socio-economically and culturally, and in terms of putting Kochi on the international culture map, something that does not go unappreciated in Kerala. McKinsey and companies have expressed their interest in studying the Biennale to know its economic effects. According to Karthyayani G. Menon, director of Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai, Kerala — unlike Mumbai, Baroda or Kolkata had not been in the forefront in encouraging artists and giving them good platforms but now she hoped that the biennale would mark a change to that situation. Many eminent artists in Kerala raised concern over the alleged lack of transparency in the way the funds were spent by Kochi-Muziris Biennale foundation. At the same time many known contemporary artists of the state of Kerala had come out in support of the event as it could help in enhancing the image of Kochi. With the 2016 demonetization of the Indian economy, several artists and the organizers of the Biennale had to overcome a struggle to get things in place for the opening of the exhibition. However, the Biennale received a boost when at the official opening, the government of the southern state of Kerala promised $1.1m funding and support for a permanent venue to cement its place as the Venice Biennale of South Asia. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is the leader of the Left Democratic Front government and long-time secretary of the Indian Communist Party in the state, said the Biennale matched Kochi’s multi-layered history of settlement by Arabs, Chinese, Jews, Portuguese, Dutch, English and different migrant communities from India. Vijayan announced 75m rupees in funding for the Biennale, the highest sum a state government in India had given an arts event. His government would support a permanent venue for the \\"mega-prestigious\\" event that had been the key to the success of the Kochi Muziris Biennale, he said. First Urban Space Dialogue in Kochi In March 2015, the Kochi Muziris Biennale Foundation partnered with Center for Public Policy Research, Cochin for the first Urban Space Dialogue in Kochi to advocate for the need for creating urban spaces in Kochi. The Dialogue featured Nuru Karim of Nu.De; Raj Cherubal of Chennai City Connect Foundation and Advisor to CPPR; Dr Dhanuraj, Chairman, CPPR; Jitish Kallat, Curator of Biennale 2014-15; Bose Krishnamachary and Riyas Komu founders of the Biennale.  The Third Kochi-Muziris Biennale  The third edition of the Kochi Muziris Biennale opened on 12 December 2016 and is curated by Sudarshan Shetty. Sudarshan was declared curator of the 2016 Kochi-Muzirs Biennale by the Minister for Culture, K. C. Joseph at an event in the State capital Thiruvananthapuram on 15 July 2015. He was unanimously chosen as curator by an Artistic Advisory Committee appointed by the Kochi Biennale Foundation for the third edition. The Committee comprised artists Amar Kanwar, Atul Dodiya, Bharti Kher and Jyothi Basu, art critic Ranjit Hoskote, patron Kiran Nadar, gallerist Shireen Gandhy along with KBF trustees Sunil V, Riyas Komu and Bose Krishnamachari. The exhibition is concurrently staged at 12 venues and featured 97 works as well as 20 events. Sudarshan Shetty was born in Mangalore in 1961, with his family moving to Bombay within a few months of his birth. He has since been based in Bombay. His works have been exhibited in solo and group shows in India and abroad, including at the Gwangju Biennale (2000), Tate Modern, London (2001), Fukuoka Asian Art Museum (2001), Centre Pompidou, Paris (2011), Guggenheim Museum, New York (2010), and Kochi-Muziris Biennale (2012). The list of artists at the 2016 KMB can be found on the Kochi Muziris Biennale website. The Fourth Kochi-Muziris Biennale The fourth edition of Kochi-Muziris Biennale opened on 12 December 2018 and is curated by indian artist Anita Dube.  The Fifth Kochi-Muziris Biennale  In May 2019, it was announced that Singaporean artist and writer, Shubigi Rao would curate the fifth edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale from December 2020 to April 2021. Rao had previously exhibited at the fourth Kochi-Muziris Biennale in 2018, the sole Singaporean representative. Titled “In our Veins Flow Ink and Fire,” the first announced artist list involved 25 participating artists and collectives, featuring names such as Arpita Singh, Decolonizing Architecture Art Residency, Iman Issa, Joan Jonas, Melati Suryodarmo, Samson Young, Slavs and Tatars, Thảo Nguyên Phan, and Yinka Shonibare. Both Kochi-Muziris Biennale founder Bose Krishnamachari and Shubigi Rao would be jointly featured on the 2019 edition of the ArtReview Power 100 list for their work on the Biennale.

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. This episode deals with Red Riding Hood's backstory, and Ruby being hired by Emma. It was written by Jane Espenson, while being directed by Ron Underwood. Plot =Opening sequence= Red Riding Hood is shown in the forest. =In the characters' past= In a small village in the Enchanted Forest, a happy, cloak-wearing Red Riding Hood (Meghan Ory) flirts with her love Peter (Jesse Hutch) through her window before being called away by her Granny (Beverley Elliott), also known as the Widow Lucas. A group of villagers show up at their cottage door, planning to go after a giant wolf that has been killing their sheep. Red asks if she can go, but Granny refuses to let her and tells her to stay inside with her cloak on—even after they secure their cottage. The following morning, Red goes to check on the chickens, only to come across a sleepy Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Red agrees to help Snow, who, being a fugitive, asks to be called Mary. When they go to the well for water, they notice the water is filled with blood and find a trail of slaughtered bodies left lying on the snowy ground. Later on, during a town hall meeting, Granny tells the citizens of her own encounter with another wolf, which killed her family 60 years earlier and left her with a scarred arm. She claims that there is no way anyone can kill the creature. Despite this, Red and a reluctant Snow decide to search for the wolf on their own. Red, a superior tracker, finds the wolf prints, but they morph into human boot prints as the duo follow them. Worse, they lead to Red's window and the only person she remembers seeing there is Peter. That night, Red meets Peter to tell him he is a werewolf. She has to tie him up on full moon nights, but she will stay with him. Back at Granny's cottage, Granny finds Snow posing as Red in her cloak on her bed. Snow assures Granny they are safe since Red has Peter tied up. Granny is dismayed at this and explains that Red is the wolf and the curse has been passed among the family. Granny herself was a wolf but has lost most of her power due to age, though she can still track Red by scent. They find the tree where Red tied up Peter, but it is too late—she has already transformed and devoured him. Granny strikes Red with a silver-tipped arrow and orders Snow to put the cloak over her as it is magical and keeps the wearer from becoming a wolf. Red returns to her human form, confused at first, then horrified to discover what she has done. The hunting party closes in as Granny tells the girls to make their escape into the woods. =In Storybrooke= At the sheriff's office, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) asks David Nolan (Josh Dallas) a few questions about Kathryn's absence, but since there is no proof of a crime, she lets him go. Elsewhere at Granny's Diner, Ruby (Ory) is chatting with August (Eion Bailey), who tells her about his world travels. Granny calls her over and tells her to start the paperwork that comes with extra business. Ruby answers that she would rather see the world like August and quits her tedious job. Emma and Mary Margaret (Goodwin) run into Ruby trying to brush off Dr. Whale (David Anders), and get a ride out of town. They offer to take her home with them so she can figure things out. Mary Margaret later goes to the spot where Kathryn had disappeared and runs into David, who is now acting strange and keeps repeating over and over that he's looking for his wife, leaving Mary Margaret very concerned about his behavior. Back in the sheriff's office, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) helps Ruby look for jobs, such as being a bike courier. When Ruby answers the phone and takes messages for Emma, she applauds her for her help and offers her a job as her assistant. Ruby goes to pick up lunch for everyone just as Mary Margaret walks in to tell Emma everything that happened with David. At the diner, Ruby tries to flaunt how happy she is now, but Granny doesn't seem to buy it. She tells Ruby her new job is basically the same as her old one, majorly cutting down Ruby's confidence. When she returns with the food, Emma tells Ruby that she's going to do real police work and help her find David. They follow tracks in the woods when Ruby hears something. With Ruby in the lead, she and Emma find David groaning and barely conscious. He reveals that he doesn't remember anything since leaving the sheriff's office the previous night. At the same time, Ruby doesn’t know how she found him. In the hospital, Dr. Whale tells David and Emma that there is a good chance he was asleep during the whole ordeal and it might have been the same thing as when he came out of his coma. Regina (Lana Parrilla) then barges in, being David's emergency contact, and immediately tells Emma to leave. In the hall, Emma calls Ruby, telling her to go to the Toll Bridge and see if she finds anything. There, Ruby uses her unknown senses and instincts to find a box buried under a washed-up piece of wood. She screams in horror when she sees what is inside of the box. Back in the office, Emma opens the box. She tells Ruby she did a good job, but Ruby doesn't feel cut out for the excitement of police work. Ruby goes to the diner where she talks to Granny who reveals that the markings on her arm are here in Storybrooke and that her arm bothers her once a month. Granny tells Ruby she had asked her to learn every part of running the diner so that when she retires, she can leave the diner to her. Granny wants to leave it to someone who loves it as well. After hugging her, Ruby gets her job back and turns down Emma's job offer. At David's place of work, he paces in the lobby with Mary Margaret trying to calm him down. Emma comes in to tell them about the box, which contained a human heart and fingerprints inside. David reacts right away, telling Emma to put him in handcuffs, but she stops him to reveal that the fingerprints belong to another suspect, Mary Margaret. Production \\"Red-Handed\\" was written by consulting producer Jane Espenson, while Tremors director, Ron Underwood, directed the episode. Beverley later recalled that her friends all assumed that Peter was the wolf of the story, and never suspected that Red might be. \\"The whole room screamed,\\" she said, when they learned the truth.

To cover the prince's escape, Red throws off her cloak under the full moon, which lets her transform into the wolf. Back in the cottage, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) is humming \\"With a Smile and a Song,\\" seemingly content, until she spots a bluebird, which she swats violently. Grumpy (Lee Arenberg) enters to ask her to come to dinner, but it turns out that the dwarves have arranged an intervention with the help of Jiminy Cricket (Raphael Sbarge). They explain to Snow that she has been angry and unfriendly since she drank the amnesia potion. Snow blames her ire on the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), and decides to take revenge on her instead. Snow learns that the Queen will soon be en route to her summer palace. Grumpy hopes to find a potion that will reverse Snow's predicament, but is told by Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) that \\"no potion can bring back true love,\\" saying that \\"if you can bottle love, you can do anything.\\" Snow tells Rumpelstiltskin that she does not desire to have her love back anyway, but instead wants his help in killing the Queen, so he gives her a magical bow and arrow. After Snow has left, Charming asks Rumpelstiltskin to undo the potion. Rumpelstiltskin reminds him that true love's kiss can break any spell and gives him a map of Snow's whereabouts in exchange for Charming's cloak. Hours later in the woods, Charming ambushes her from behind, kissing her passionately. However, Snow still does not remember who he is, and knocks him unconscious and ties him to a tree. Moments later Jiminy arrives and sets Charming free, then mentions that Snow is not going to remember who Charming is until she remembers herself. Snow prepares to strike the Queen riding out in the open but Charming dives into the arrow's path taking it in the shoulder. Charming reminds Snow that he would die for her, which Snow is touched by. He then kisses her again and she begins to remember, but their reunion is short-lived as King George's army finds Charming and Snow, as Snow is shoved away while Charming is put into a moving prison. Snow swears she will find him and as she returns to the Dwarfs' cottage to apologize for her actions towards them, the dwarves forgive her and agree to help with their plans to rescue Charming. Meanwhile, Rumpelstiltskin takes a hair from Charming's cloak and pairs it with Snow's hair, then bottles it successfully, labeling it \\"True Love.\\" =In Storybrooke= At the Sheriff's office, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), despite believing Mary Margaret's (Goodwin) innocence in Kathryn's (Anastasia Griffith) murder, photographs Mary Margaret for her mug shots. Regina (Parrilla) joins the two as Emma questions Mary Margaret. Emma pulls out the box that the heart was found in. To Mary Margaret's surprise, it is her jewelry box and states it must have been stolen. Regina states that she does not believe her. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) says that Regina has a motive: she hates Snow White. Emma finds no signs of a break-in, but hears rattling coming from the heating vent. Upon opening it, she finds a hunter's knife inside, which matches the weapon that was used in the murder. Later on at Granny's, August (Eion Bailey) approaches Henry to talk to him. August tells Henry that he believes that his book could be more than just stories. August says he has come to make people like Emma believe, but Emma won't go off of blind faith; she needs proof. August then hints that the answers to Henry's problems are instead in the book itself. Despite Emma's reservations about Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Mary Margaret hires him as her lawyer. Later, Henry finds the ring of keys in Regina's office and shows them to Emma, telling her that he thinks Regina used the keys to get into their apartment to steal the jewelry box and plant the hunting knife. Emma has a hard time believing him until Henry uses one of the keys to open the door. Meanwhile, David (Dallas) speaks with Regina, saying that he believes in Mary Margaret's innocence. Regina tells him that everyone has a dark side. David accuses himself, blaming his blackouts. During a session with Archie (Sbarge), David goes under hypnosis to remember what happened during the blackouts, and has a flashback to the Enchanted Forest, where he is telling Snow not to murder the Evil Queen. He tells Mary Margaret about the vision but doesn't realize that this is a flashback to the Enchanted Forest, not the Storybrooke woods. When he asks Mary Margaret whether or not she killed Kathryn, Mary Margaret tells him to leave, upset that he does not believe her. Not long after the confrontation, Mary Margaret discovers a key in her cell. Emma tells Mary Margaret that the DNA test results came back and the heart was Kathryn's, but tells Mary Margaret she believes Mary Margaret is being framed.

While Regina plays with the ring Daniel gave her while staring out the window, Mr. Gold asks her for a favor in getting District Attorney Albert Spencer to drop the battery charges against him, and in return he offers her an idea on how to inflict pain upon Mary Margaret. It also turns out that Mr. Gold and Regina know what happens to people when they try to leave town. When Regina asks how she can trust him, Mr. Gold truthfully responds that he always honors his agreements. A week later, Elsewhere, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) comes out of the diner as David Nolan (Josh Dallas) catches up with her where he tries to apologize for saying that Mary Margret was guilty, but Emma informs him that she needs a miracle.

An angry Regina tells her to stop using her magic to control her. With that, Regina promises to be good. Later that evening, Regina meets up with Daniel and kisses him. The next day, Daniel tells Regina to tell her parents about their love.

Meanwhile, a young Snow White (Bailee Madison) loses control of her horse nearby, prompting Regina to save her. Later on, Cora changes Regina into a ball gown using magic and explains that King Leopold (Richard Schiff) is coming to thank her for rescuing Snow White.

Suddenly, Snow White walks into the stable to witness the pair kissing before running away. Regina manages to catch up to Snow after she trips and falls.

Snow smiles after the explanation but Regina makes her promise to keep this secret, to which Snow agrees. The next day, Snow White is looking at the flowers and reaches up to grab one when Cora comes in and tells her to be gentle.

That night, Regina runs into the stable where Daniel is ready to go to make their getaway. They embrace just before Cora arrives and locks the stable. Cora says she will not stop her and Regina hugs her with thanks, then takes Daniel aside and rips his heart out and crushes it, killing him.

After Regina yells and screams of how she loved Daniel, Cora explains that love is weakness. As Regina is being fitted for her wedding dress, Snow White walks in and tells her that she is the fairest of them all. Snow tells Regina about how she told her mother about Daniel. As Regina listens in horror, she turns and Snow notices how upset she is and she apologizes.

It has a population of 494 people as of 2012. This village has the Guyana Sevashram (Hindu Temple). Location It is located about 19 miles southeast of the capital city Georgetown. The Atlantic Ocean sits to the North; and some of the country's largest rice fields are just beyond its southern horizon. Culture  The culture in Cove and John slightly resembles that of the Indian immigrants who crossed the Atlantic Ocean over 150 years ago. Even though well over 90% of the population remains Indo-Guyanese - a small group of Chinese and Amerindian families are the minority - the culture is very similar to that of the rest of the British Caribbean, but with, according to the locals, an East Indian flair. In the beginning, the culture of Cove and John resembled very much that of the mother country, India, but as African and Chinese infiltrated the village a slight variety was added. The residents of Cove and John, Indo-Guyanese, Afro- Guyanese, and Chinese Guyanese brought their foods, traditions, religion and customs with them. Over the years, the population of Indians has lost their mother tongue completely, and although Indian music remains very popular, the English language, with a slight Creole touch, has taken complete control. No one speaks Hindi anymore in Cove and John, and it is consider a dead language. The colloquial English use is heavily influenced by the British. Being a colony for many years, Guyana is touched with a flair of British in almost everything and so is Cove and John. Like the British custom to drink tea many of daily activities are in small ways reflective of the past. Even the system of Government, although it has been slightly modified over the years, still imitates the British rules and laws. Many of the original religious customs and traditions that have not been lost were modified by the ages and vestiges of an East Indian heritage appear in a number of the festivities. For example, few weddings are ever complete without the ceremonial rubbing of the dye; an old Indian wedding custom that is accepted among every religion. Holidays like Christmas and Diwali are examples of occasions where the entire community celebrates together in a congenial integration of faith. Schools  Cove and John has two primary schools and one high school. The schools are Cove and John Primary, St Andrews Primary School, and the Hindu College. Seawall This small village is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by large concrete seawalls. The main pump station pumps water out whenever rain falls.

The publication of magazines dedicated exclusively to comics, in Brazil, started at the beginning of the 20th century. Brazilian artists have worked with both styles. In the case of American comics some have achieved international fame, like Roger Cruz with X-Men and Mike Deodato with Thor, Wonder Woman and others. History = Precursors and initial steps (1837–1895) = First Brazil editorial cartoon, by Manuel de Araújo Porto- alegre (1837). Brazilian comics have a long history, that goes back to the 19th century. As a charge, the first drawing was circulated in 1837, sold in separate like a lithography, by Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre. This author would latter create a magazine of political humor in 1844. Angelo Agostini, pioneer of Brazilian comics. In the late of the 1860s, Angelo Agostini continued the tradition of introducing the Brazilian journalistic and popular publications, drawings with themes of political and social satire. Between his most popular characters, drawn as protagonists of stories in comics, were Nho Quim (1869) and Zé Caipora (1883).Angelo Agostini, pioneiro dos quadrinhos Agostini published in magazines like Vida Fluminense, O Malho, and Don Quixote. = O Tico-Tico = Released on October 11, 1905, the magazine O Tico-Tico is considered the first comic book in the country. Designed by the cartoonist Renato de Castro, the project was presented to Luís Bartolomeu de Souza e Silva, the owner of the magazine O Malho (where Angelo Agostini worked after the cancellation of Don Quixote). After being approved, the magazine was attended by Angelo Agostini, who created the logo and some stories. The format was inspired by the French children's magazine La Semaine de Suzette, which had some of its characters adapted to a Brazilian version. The magazine had the collaboration of renowned artists such as J. Carlos (responsible for the graphic changes in 1922), Max Yantok, and Alfredo Storni. The most successful character in the magazine was Chiquinho (published between 1905 and 1958), considered for many years an original Brazilian creation (however, in recent publications the character has been accused of being a rip-off of the American character Buster Brown). Other characters who starred in the magazine were Reco-Reco, Bolão e Azeitona by Luiz Sá, Lamparina by J. Carlos, Kaximbown by Max Yantok, Max Muller by A. Rocha, and others. In the 1930s, some American strips and characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Krazy Kat, and Felix the Cat, were published in the magazine. J. Carlos was the first Brazilian artist to draw characters from the Walt Disney Company in the pages of Tico-Tico. The magazine lost popularity in the 1930s when new comic books and newspaper comic strips were released in Brazil. The magazine ended in 1957, with some republications until 1977. = Supplements and the creation of the Publishers = In September 1929, the newspaper A Gazeta creates a comic supplement in tabloid format, based on the Sunday supplements of the American comics; in the following month, Casa Editorial Vecchi (an Italian origin publisher) published the magazine: Mundo Infantil, but the success of the supplements was given in 1934 with the creation of the magazine Suplemento Infantil (later renamed as Suplemento Juvenil) by Adolfo Aizen. Aizen was known to work in the newspaper O Globo, and also in magazines O Malho and O Tico-Tico. His project was loosely inspired by American comics, he formed partnerships to publish the stories with characters like Flash Gordon, Mandrake the Magician, Donald Duck, Popeye, along original characters created by Brazilian artists as As Aventuras de Roberto Sorocaba. With the success of the magazine other magazine supplements were created in the following years, among them the one that earned popularity was O Globo Juvenil, created by Roberto Marinho to compete against the Suplemento Juvenil. O Globo Juvenil was responsible for introducing characters such as Superman, The Phantom, Prince Valiant, Li'l Abner, Alley Oop, and the republication of some titles from Suplemento Juvenil. In 1937, a new character was created through the newspaper supplements called A Garra Cinzenta, created by Francisco Armond and Renato Silva. The character has become known for its mature themes involving mystery, horror and science fiction. The comics ended in 1939 totaling 100 pages, and was later republished in the Franco-Belgian market.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on February 26, 2012. The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple and series showrunner Glen Mazzara and directed by Ernest Dickerson. In the episode, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) debate Randall (Michael Zegen)'s fate, leading to a physical battle between the two. Meanwhile, the survivors at the Greene farm deal with Beth Greene (Emily Kinney)'s suicidal behavior. Gimple added Rick and Shane's climactic fight scene into the episode's script, while Dickerson collaborated with stunt coordinator Lonnie Smith, Jr. on the choreography. An 800-pound motorcycle was used in the sequence, which was lightened by emptying the gas tank. \\"18 Miles Out\\" features recurring appearances from several actors and actresses including Lauren Cohan (Maggie Greene), Emily Kinney (Beth Greene), and Michael Zegen (Randall Culver). \\"18 Miles Out\\" was well received by a number of television commentators, who praised the storyline and character development. Upon airing, it attained 7.04 million viewers and a 3.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode became the second most-viewed cable telecast of the day, as well as the second most- watched cable television program of the week. Plot Randall (Michael Zegen), the teenager who Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) rescued, has fully recovered from his leg injury. Rick and Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) tie him up, gag him with duct tape and blindfold him, with plans to leave him at a school 18 miles from the farm. En route, Rick confronts Shane about what Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) has told him, including Shane's attraction to Lori and Shane's involvement in Otis' death. At the school, they find a secure building and leave Randall there with a knife. As they leave, Randall pleads to take them back, and then says he had gone to school with Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and knows her father Hershel (Scott Wilson), suggesting he knows the farm's location. Shane prepares to kill Randall, but Rick tackles him. During the fight that follows, Rick is able to defeat Shane, who angrily breaks a window that releases a horde of walkers in the building. Shane takes safety in a school bus while Rick rescues Randall back to their vehicle. After contemplating leaving Shane, Rick returns to help Shane get to safety as well. They tie up and gag Randall again and return with him to the farm. Rick tells Shane that he will need to follow his orders to remain part of the group. At the farmhouse, Lori, Maggie, and Andrea (Laurie Holden) are taking care of Maggie's younger sister Beth (Emily Kinney), who is now conscious. Maggie confides that Glenn (Steven Yeun) has lost confidence because he feels their relationship made him lose focus at the shootout in the bar, hence Lori advises her to make Glenn \\"man up\\". The women eventually realize Beth has become suicidal and place her under suicide watch. Lori and Andrea argue; Andrea believes the decision to stay alive should be Beth's alone, while Lori strongly disagrees; Andrea and Lori criticize each other in the process. Andrea then proceeds to take over responsibility for Beth, after convincing Maggie to take a break. She locks Beth inside the room, opens the bathroom door, and leaves Beth alone to make her own choice. She advises the pain will never subside, \\"but you make room for it\\". Beth attempts suicide by using a shard of broken mirror to cut her wrist, but Maggie and Lori manage to pry the bathroom door open in time to save Beth, who is bleeding profusely but relatively okay. Andrea returns to the house to check on Beth and is confronted by a furious Maggie. Andrea reasons that she allowed Beth to explore her choices, and Beth is now more convinced than ever that suicide is not an option. Maggie condemns Andrea's actions and forbids her from ever again setting foot inside the house. Production \\"18 Miles Out\\" was directed by Ernest Dickerson and co-written by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh reaches a climax in \\"18 Miles Out\\", in which the two men get into a heated argument, ultimately engaging in a physical confrontation. Gimple conceived and wrote the scene into the episode's script. In the fight scene, the moves were choreographed. Dickerson collaborated with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who served as the stunt coordinator. Smith cast two stuntmen to demonstrate and act out the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could duplicate the choreography. Jeremy Connors portrayed Rick, while Trent Bry played the role of Shane. In the fight sequence, Shane topples a motorcycle onto Rick's legs, temporarily immobilizing him. The motorcycle weighed an estimated 800 pounds; in order to decrease the weight of the vehicle, Dickerson and his team emptied the gas tank. This was rehearsed at the series' production studios. Scalan Backus, The Walking Deads special effects technician, rigged the vehicle's footpeg to prevent it from sliding and making contact with the actors' legs. Backus also added a rod with a secure stable so it would give further clearance to the actors and increase the motorcycle's height from the ground. The cameramen filmed the shots at an angle, creating the illusion that the vehicle did hit the actors' legs. Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation: > At the end of this week's episode, Rick is of the mind that they're square; > they've got everything out in the open, they've each said their piece and > they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and > they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't > necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are > settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's > necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on > the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has > a bone to pick. While returning to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker in an abandoned field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. \\"We're really just trying to show that that kind of thing is inescapable,\\" he said. \\"You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world is becoming more and more populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart of this began and as [Rick and crew] moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers.\\" Lori Grimes accuses Andrea of participating very little in household tasks. Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; \\"Lori is really just aggravated over a lot of things and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has a lot of things going on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again. She's going through a lot of stuff.\\" Cultural references \\"18 Miles Out\\" features several references to music, film, media, and other pop culture phenomena. The episode is structured similarly to the Breaking Bad episode \\"4 Days Out\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote: \\"'18 Miles Out' has a title that's very similar to '4 Days Out', one of the most memorable episodes of Breaking Bad, and a structure that's relatively similar: our two leads go on a long drive together for what should be a routine bit of business, have a lot of conversations about where they are at this point, and then hit a major obstacle that might keep them from driving home alive.\\" While driving in his car, Rick tells Shane of an incident with a close relative, who was sitting in blizzard-like conditions while listening to a narrative of Lord of the Rings. A scene towards the end of the episode contains the song Driver's Seat by rock band Sniff 'n' the Tears. In the concluding scene of \\"18 Miles Out\\", the song \\"Civilian\\" by indie folk band Wye Oak can be heard playing in the background. Reception =Ratings= \\"18 Miles Out\\" was originally broadcast on February 26, 2012 in the United States on AMC. Upon airing, the episode attained 7.04 million viewers and a 3.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Although it obtained the highest-rating in the 18-49 demographic out of any cable telecast of the day, \\"18 Miles Out\\" was the second most-viewed cable television program of the week. Its total viewership was slightly below that of the 2012 NBA All- Star Game, which garnered 7.07 million viewers. The episode became the second highest-rated cable program of the week dated February 26. Ratings and total viewership increased moderately from the previous episode, \\"Triggerfinger\\", which received 6.89 million viewers and a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic. =Critical response= \\"18 Miles Out\\" was critically acclaimed by television commentators. Bex Schwartz of Rolling Stone opined that the installment was an excellent and well-written episode, proclaiming that it \\"balanced zombie action with human drama\\". In his B grade review for the episode, Zack Halden of The A.V. Club felt that \\"18 Miles Out\\" was one of the second season's more solid attempts; \\"While there's no question this is still serialized, the story here had a clear beginning, middle, and end, and we stay focused the whole time on two plot arcs: Rick and Shane deciding what to do with Randall [...] while Lori, Maggie, and Andrea deal in their own individual ways with Beth’s desire to kill herself.\\" Halden resumed that it made him hopeful of future installments of The Walking Dead. Matt Barone of Complex, Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun, and IGN's Eric Goldman asserted that \\"18 Miles Out\\" was one of the series' best episodes, while The Star-Ledger Mark Mauer thought that it was redundant, ultimately concluding that \\"it indulged in another subplot centered on a petty argument\\". Goldman professed that the episodic direction was more focused than previous installments. Concluding his review, he gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10, signifying an \\"amazing\\" rating. SFX journalist Ian Berriman echoed analogous sentiments, inevitably issuing \\"18 Miles Out\\" a four-and-a-half star rating. He called it the season's best episode, and wrote that it was filled with \\"action, explosive arguments, [and] difficult decisions\\". Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal touted the installment; \\"The writers' oratorical impulses were mostly kept in check, giving us instead an action-filled A plot in the field and a suspenseful B plot on the farm, and both have serious stakes. The motif connecting the two plots: knives. This episode was all about knives.\\" Gary Roszko of The Huffington Post stated that \\"18 Miles Out\\" was a nice transition from what he thought was the typical development of the show. Sepinwall asserted that the episode was the strongest telecast since the second-season premiere, \\"What Lies Ahead\\". While CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell felt that it was a good telecast, he declared that \\"18 Miles Out\\" was slightly inferior to its predecessor. New York Starlee Kine was critical of the flashbacks in the episode, who described the process as baffling. She wrote, \\"It was done in the oddest way, though, where the flashbacks didn’t add any additional information than that which we already knew. It was as though the writers thought a flashback could be used in place of their characters having backstories, instead of as a vehicle to convey them.\\" Critics lauded the development of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook on the future of the two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as \\"darn good\\", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it \\"wholly satisfying\\". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; \\"The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal.\\" Goldman summated on the scene: \\"Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a very good job of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment.\\" References External links *\\"18 Miles Out\\" at AMC * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 2) episodes ","title":"18 Miles Out"},{"id":"34556744","text":"\\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" is the eleventh episode of the second season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead. It originally aired on AMC in the United States on March 4, 2012. In this episode, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his group opt to execute Randall (Michael Zegen), much to the frustration of Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn). Dale fears that the group is losing their humanity, which prompts him to persuade some of the group members to protest against the consensus. Meanwhile, Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) behaves recklessly and carelessly, going as far as to steal Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus)'s gun and harass a walker, which will ultimately initiate grave consequences for the group. \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" was directed by Greg Nicotero and written by Angela Kang. It explores themes of declining morality and humanity during a catastrophic event. The episode features the death of Dale, who was severely injured during an attack by a walker. It also marks changes in the character development of Carl, who evolves into a desensitized character who loses his naivete to the world around him. \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" features recurring appearances from several actors and actresses including Lauren Cohan (Maggie Greene), Emily Kinney (Beth Greene), Scott Wilson (Hershel Greene), Michael Zegen (Randall Culver) and IronE Singleton (T-Dog). Commentators praised the episode, citing its character development and concluding scene as episode highlights. Upon airing, \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" attained 6.771 million viewers and a 3.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. It became the highest-rated cable telecast of the day, as well as the highest-rated cable program of the week. This episode marks the final appearance of Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath). Plot Daryl (Norman Reedus) beats and interrogates Randall (Michael Zegen) in the barn. Randall admits he comes from a larger group of men, who had once found and raped two girls in front of their father. The group agrees that Randall is an imminent threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) believes he should be executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds most of the group agree with Rick's decision, and attempts to change their minds by appealing to their humanity, civilization and morality. Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should he be able to convince the others to change their minds. As the day progresses, Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) becomes restless and sneaks into the barn to observe Randall; Randall tries to convince Carl to release him. Shane discovers Carl's presence and scolds him. Outside, Carol (Melissa McBride) attempts to cheer Carl up by reminding him Sophia is in heaven, but he lashes out at her, disgusted seeing Carol calm about losing her daughter. Carl ends up taking a gun from Daryl's stash and heading into the nearby swamp alone. He finds a walker half-stuck in mud, and taunts it by throwing rocks at it and then moves in close to shoot it in the head. The walker suddenly frees one of its legs and lurches forward; Carl panics and drops the gun before running back to camp, not telling anyone what happened. Meanwhile, Beth (Emily Kinney) has since recovered from her earlier suicide attempt. When Glenn (Steven Yeun) comes to check on her condition, Hershel (Scott Wilson) gives him a family heirloom representing his approval of Glenn's relationship with his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan). At sunset, the group discusses Randall's fate, and Dale's arguments have failed to sway the group, and he storms out. Rick, Shane, and Daryl return to the barn and Rick prepares to shoot Randall when Carl runs in and urges his father to do it. Rick is horrified and stops the execution, much to Shane's annoyance. Dale walks alone in the fields to cool off when he comes across a cow that has had its stomach gutted. Realizing the danger, he is about to head back when a walker attacks him. The group races towards his screams, and Daryl quickly dispatches the walker; Carl realizes it is the walker he found in the swamp. Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will not survive. The group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the revolver and ends Dale's suffering. Production \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" was directed by Greg Nicotero and written by Angela Kang. The episode became Nicotero's first directing credit for a full-length television episode of the series; he had previously conceived and directed the six-part web series The Walking Dead: Torn Apart. As part of a promotional campaign, cast member Norman Reedus participated in a live chat on Entertainment Weekly coinciding with the airing of \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\". Jeffrey DeMunn makes his final regular appearance as Dale Horvath in this episode. This episode addresses the death of Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Jeffrey DeMunn was \\"furious\\" about the firing of longtime friend Frank Darabont, who developed and previously acted as showrunner for the series, and asked to be let go from the show. In a 2018 interview with The Plain Dealer, DeMunn said, \\"I spent a week not being able to take a full breath. And then I realized, 'Oh, I can quit.' So I called them and said, 'It's a zombie show. Kill me. I don't want to do this anymore.' It was an immense relief to me.\\" Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking a turning point for future development of The Walking Dead. \\"Dale's character has been the heart and soul of the show,\\" he iterated. \\"He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot.\\" Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: \\"It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him.\\" In \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\", Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus, pictured) shoots Dale to put him out of his misery. Robert Kirkman felt this was Daryl's way of coping with the loss of Sophia and finding his place in the group. In contrast to his role in the television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: \\"I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show is always going to be a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly.\\" As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates to shoot Dale, Daryl takes the gun and inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter suggested that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl to pull away from interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his \\"putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up.\\"; \\"So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't want to be a part of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do.\\" In \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\", Carl evolves into a desensitized character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté to the world around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was \\"one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world.\\" He continued: \\"It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re going to start to see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about what it would be like to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say.\\" Reception =Ratings= \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" was originally broadcast on March 4, 2012 in the United States on AMC. Upon airing, the episode garnered 6.771 million viewers and a 3.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. This indicates that 3.5% of people from the demographic viewed the episode. It became the highest-rated cable telecast of the day, attaining significantly higher ratings than that of Storage Wars on A&E; Television and Real Housewives of Atlanta on Bravo. Similarly, the episode outperformed all cable television programs during the week dated March 4. Total viewership and ratings declined moderately from the previous installment, \\"18 Miles Out\\", which obtained 7.04 million viewers and a 3.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic. =Critical response= \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" was lauded by television critics. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald called it an \\"incredible episode\\"; \\"Walking Dead again proves it is one of the best dramas on TV and almost makes me feel good about paying my cable bill.\\" Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Rene Guzman opined that it \\"delivers all that messy drama in spades with a true gut-wrenching end to one of the series’ core characters\\". Wetpaint's Molly Friedman stated that in \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\", the audience \\"finally had a reason to shed some tears and remember just how much we care about the original gang of apocalyptic misfits\\". Kevin Yeoman of The Christian Science Monitor and E! Online journalist Tierney Bricker concluded that the episode managed to effectively surprise the audience, while Cyriaque Lamar of io9 declared that \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\" was inferior to its predecessor by writing that it \\"served up a bunch of quasi-entertaining scenes of people arguing and capped them off with one of the most accidentally funny closers ever committed to basic cable\\". In his B+ review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said that the episode continued the series' path of a more focused and central direction. Josh Jackson of Paste was intrigued with the series' exploration of morality during an apocalyptic event in \\"Judge, Jury, Executioner\\". Eric Goldman of IGN was much more pessimistic about the episode than the general consensus. In his 6.5 out of 10 rating review, he called it \\"especially dull\\" when compared to the previous installment. Carl (Chandler Riggs, pictured) Dale's death was adulated by commentators, who affirmed that it was a gruesome and emotional scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, \\"Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and the embrace of a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign that things will almost certainly get worse.\\" Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: \\"It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which is profoundly too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker- infested world.\\" Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought that it was among the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was \\"riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death\\". Handlen remarked: \\"It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too little sense of danger right now.\\" Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as \\"violent\\", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; \\"That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send- off.\\" Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that \\"when the lone zombie we see in this episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, and this particular one was a most brutal executioner.\\" Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious. Handlen felt that the character development of Carl Grimes was more stable than similar developments in the episode; \\"Using Carl to both resolve the episode’s plot, and making him semi-responsible for Dale’s death, has a satisfying neatness, and serves as a reminder that for all their talk, Rick and the group have no idea what impact their choices will make.\\" Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV noticed the darker transition of the character; \\"Carl's moral compass has greatly shifted since being shot and seeing the walking corpse of his friend, Sophia,\\" asserted Rigley. Jackson concluded that it was one of the episode highlights, writing, \\"He awakened from his coma talking about the beautiful doe, but ever since the dead body of Sophia limped its way out of that barn door, he's become colder and harder. When Carol sees him at Sophia’s gravesite, she tries to comfort him with talk of heaven, and he calls her an idiot. He's looking to emulate the men leading the group—the different kinds of toughness displayed by his father, Shane and Daryl. And he finds the chance to test his own bravery, playing near a zombie stuck in the mud by the creek, keeping the discovery to himself.\\" Jackson commented on Carl's reaction to the death of Dale, saying that despite a gradual change to a dark nature, he \\"realizes [...] that he's still very much a kid\\".

Following the death of Dale Horvath in the previous episode, this episode presents a shift in attitudes amongst the group members. This episode features the death of Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal). This episode explores the depths of Shane's antagonistic behavior culminating in his murder of Randall (Michael Zegen) and ultimately a fatal confrontation with Rick where he meets his own untimely demise. Dale's death also influences the character development of Carl Grimes who has shown increased maturity in confronting the reality of the death of people close to him and the consequences of his actions. This mental growth is displayed when he properly uses his gun to dispatch a zombified Shane and save his father's life. As creator Robert Kirkman describes: \\"That scene right there, Carl would never have had the strength to pull the trigger and save his father from Shane zombie if he hadn't had that ordeal with Dale and felt responsible for killing Dale because he wasn't able to shoot that zombie\\". Plot Dale Horvath's death has profoundly impacted the group cohesion. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), reflecting back on Dale's last words that the group is \\"broken,\\" abandons Randall's (Michael Zegen) execution and plans to release the boy. Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) allows the group to stay as winter approaches, and they help to gather supplies and secure the property from walkers. A guilt-ridden Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) discloses his role in the events surrounding Dale's death, and Rick helps to console him. Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) is left speechless after Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) expresses all of her feelings to Shane, including uncertainty, regret, and appreciation toward her former lover in an attempt to keep him stationed with the group. Shane sneaks into the barn, and takes Randall at gunpoint out into the woods. There, he breaks Randall's neck, killing him, and then smashes his own face against a tree and hides his gun. Shane returns just as Randall's absence is discovered. Shane lies that Randall had escaped and overpowered him before running into the woods. Rick, Shane, Daryl (Norman Reedus), and Glenn (Steven Yeun) set off to find Randall. They split up, with Shane leading Rick in one direction. Daryl and Glenn discover Randall, now reanimated as a walker, which they dispatch before investigating the body and finding he died from the broken neck, but had not suffered any bite marks from a walker. They question how Randall had become a walker. Meanwhile, Shane continues to lead Rick back towards the farm, but Rick has grown suspicious that Shane wants to assassinate him. Shane draws his gun on Rick, but Rick refuses to engage, challenging Shane to kill an unarmed man. Rick continues to talk to Shane, allowing him to get close enough to stab Shane in the chest. Shane collapses and dies, as Rick grieves for his lost friend. As he is mourning, Carl walks up, and then aims his gun towards Rick. Rick thinks Carl is upset that he killed Shane and tries to plead with him. Rick is surprised when Carl fires at the re-animated body of Shane that was advancing on Rick from behind, killing him. Unbeknownst to them, Carl's gunshot has attracted the attention of a horde of walkers in the nearby woods that start to advance on their location. Production Jon Bernthal made his final regular appearance in this episode after his character is killed by Rick and Carl. \\"Better Angels\\" was directed by Guy Ferland and written by Evan Reilly and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The episode features the death of Shane Walsh, who was stabbed in the chest by Rick Grimes. Subsequently, Shane reanimates into a zombie and is later shot in the head by Carl Grimes. Initial talks of killing off the character commenced before the auditioning process of the series. Because of the short length of the first season of The Walking Dead, producers decided to retain the idea until the following season. Writer Robert Kirkman remarked: \\"We knew from Day 1 when we sat down in the writers' room to pull out the second season that this was going to be the season that Shane died. It was always about working toward that and building up that character and setting up this confrontation between Rick and Shane.\\" Jon Bernthal admitted that he had no coaching prior to the scene, and said that many of the writers and cast members were divided on how to execute the sequence. \\"There was a lot of discussion going back and forth, a lot of arguing going back and forth on what that last scene actually should be — between myself and Andy and the writers. And everybody kind of got their own little say in what that last scene actually was.\\" In his interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bernthal recalled the production of the scene: > We shot that scene all night long. And the entire cast came out and spent > the entire night out on that field to be there for the last scene, and Jeff > DeMunn [...] actually had been gone. He lives on a farm in upstate New York, > and he had flown down and surprised me to be there for my last scene, which > just touched me. And like I said, there was a lot of feeling about the last > scene. The writers wanted it to be one way, the actors wanted it one way, > the producers wanted it to be another way, I think everybody just sort of > had their idea of what that scene should be, and it was just Andy and I in > the woods walking out together, and Andy and I turned to each other and > said, \\"You know what, man, this is you and me. Let's do this for you and > me.” Speculation related to Bernthal's release first surfaced in January 2012, when it was announced that he was negotiating with Frank Darabont to be a part of his upcoming television project L.A. Noir, which later became known as Mob City. Reception =Critical response= Zack Handlen writing for The A.V. Club rated the episode A- on an A to F scale. Eric Goldman at IGN gave the episode 8.5 out of 10. =Ratings= Upon its initial broadcast on March 11, 2012, \\"Better Angels\\" was watched by estimated 6.89 million viewers, up slightly from the previous episode.

The episode was written by creator Robert Kirkman and showrunner Glen Mazzara, and directed by series regular Ernest Dickerson. In the episode, a huge horde of walkers invades the Greene farm, chasing Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and Hershel's groups off the premises. Meanwhile, Andrea (Laurie Holden) is separated from the group, leaving her to fight off the same walkers that attacked Hershel's farm. Themes such as romance, death, and survival are prevalent throughout \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\". It is seen as a turning point for the development of several characters on the show, and flashbacks to various previous revelations in the series. \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" features the debut of protagonist Michonne, a character who has been prominently featured in the comics of the same name, and it introduces the prison. Production for the episode transpired over about 8 days. \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" attracted 9 million viewers and a 4.7 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode amassed record ratings, thus becoming the highest-rated cable program demographically of all time, an accolade that was previously held by \\"Nebraska.\\" \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" became the most-viewed cable telecast of the day, as well as the highest-rated cable program of the week. Plot The episode opens showing a horde of walkers as they follow a helicopter overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days. As they near the Greene farm, they hear the sound of a gunshot—from the shot that Carl (Chandler Riggs) used to kill a reanimated Shane Walsh—and they turn to head towards the farm. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn. Elsewhere, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) report the death and reanimation of Randall to the others, but also that he turned without being bit. Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) begs Daryl to go out and search for Rick and Shane. However, they too soon see the walker horde and start arming themselves. While Rick's group is ready to abandon the farm, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) intends to protect his land with his own life, if needed. As the group starts to dispatch walkers, Rick and Carl are able to lure a number into the barn, and set it ablaze. Jimmy (James Allen McCune) drives the RV near the barn and allows Rick and Carl to safely escape the burning barn, but he is killed when the walkers overrun the RV. The group quickly realizes they are outnumbered, and they all attempt to escape to safety. Patricia (Jane McNeill) is killed as walkers overtake the Greene household, and Rick convinces Hershel to abandon his property as it is a lost cause. Everyone escapes in groups, except for Andrea (Laurie Holden), who was separated from the others. Unknown to them, she manages to escape the farm, only to run into a mysterious hooded figure who has two armless walker pets and wields a katana. The surviving group regroups on the highway that they had been taking to reach Fort Benning at the start of the season, and assume Andrea is dead. With their remaining vehicles, they travel on back roads to avoid hordes, until one runs out of gas. They camp for the night, where Daryl pressures Rick on how Randall's body had reanimated without a walker bite. Rick reveals what Dr. Edwin Jenner whispered in his ear: they are all infected carriers of the walker pathogen, and become walkers if they die for any reason. Rick also reveals that he had been forced to kill Shane, and Carl had shot his reanimated form, shocking Lori. As they continue to debate, the others, save for Daryl and Hershel, start to lose their faith in Rick as a leader. A noise echoing in the distance places the group on high alert, but Rick does not allow anyone to investigate. Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) urges Rick to take action, causing Rick to snap, saying that he never asked that he be put in charge, and blurting out that he had killed Shane for their sake. He dares anyone to leave the safety of the camp. When nobody leaves, he issues a final warning: \\"If you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore,\\" establishing his position as leader of the group. Afterwards, the group is shown to be unknowingly camped near a prison. Production \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" was directed by Ernest Dickerson and written by creator Robert Kirkman and showrunner Glen Mazzara. Mazzara teased the episode in a conference call with various journalists: \\"We're proud of this finale, we've been building to it all season, and we can't wait for you to see it. [...] There's more bloodshed coming. They thought they were safe on this farm, they were wrong. [...] We're on a killing spree here. [...] There are answers about the nature of the virus in the finale. [...] I will guarantee people will watch this finale and want to know what comes next. People will have a lot of questions, but in a good way.\\" The episode filmed for eight days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a cigarette lighter and drops it onto a horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special-effects director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture the elements of the fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury. \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" features the deaths of Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside the deaths of the aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt that considerable potential for development existed in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. \\"The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive.\\" The night on which \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" was so cold, the editors had to digitally remove vapor expelled by the walkers. This episode introduces the character Michonne, a protagonist in the comic series of the same name who is portrayed by Danai Gurira. Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\", although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale. Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the HBO drama series Treme. Rutina Wesley, who played Tara Thornton in True Blood, was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne, although Kirkman stated that she was never involved in the auditioning process. \\"It was a lot of actresses. The True Blood actress, I don't know that she was even available; I think she's still on True Blood. I don't know where that rumor came from, but to my knowledge, she was never involved.\\" In the conclusion of \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\", a large prison is seen in the background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. \\"There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there,\\" he asserted. \\"I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway.\\" Themes \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" is seen as a transitional stage for several characters in the series. The transformation of Rick Grimes to a dark character continues in the episode. He has changed from the person who wanted to save Merle Dixon (in season one) and find Sophia Peletier (first half of season two), to the person who is willing to abandon any hope of finding Andrea. Furthermore, Rick yells at his group for being unappreciative of his sacrifices as a leader. This backlash and hostility have been interpreted as a foreshadowing event for future development for The Walking Dead. \\"Rick is clearly in a much darker place now than he was at the start of the season,\\" concluded Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich. In a similar fashion, Lori Grimes is furious at Rick after he admits that he killed Shane Walsh. According to Kirkman, \\"it looks pretty clear that he has lost [Lori and Carl] by doing this\\" at the end of \\"Beside the Dying Fire.\\" In response to the interactions between Rick and Lori, he opined: \\"I think he feels that he has sacrificed for this group, and that sacrifice hasn’t really been appreciated. His confession to Lori did not get the reaction that he had hoped. He thought she would be supportive. Instead, she reacts in a particular way that he feels is hatred and disgust. I think that’s really affecting him. Let's not forget: This is taking place hours after he murdered his best friend. So he is still reeling. He’s trying to keep that a secret. He opens his heart to his wife, and it doesn’t go well. So I think that he’s just done with these people. I think he doesn’t want to be the leader. As he says: If they don’t like it, they’re free to leave.\\" The episode flashbacks to the previous developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. \\"All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son was a part of it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability.\\" \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" reminiscences to the first-season finale, \\"TS-19\\",in that Rick reveals that everyone in the group is infected with the virus. Although Kirkman described his actions as \\"exhibiting good leadership skills,\\" Mazzara said that the group began to question Rick's capabilities as a leader. \\"He presents them with a very pragmatic option: If you don't like it, get the hell out and there are no takers. At the end of the finale, the true horror is Rick when he says, 'It ain't a democracy anymore.' That's the true horror.\\" Themes of Social Darwinism and survival are prevalent throughout \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\". In the episode, Andrea is separated from the group and is forced to fend herself against the horde of walkers that invaded Hershel's farm. Mazzara felt that separating Andrea from her group would be essential in exploring her character in-depth, as he stated that she was viewed in the light of other characters on The Walking Dead. Reception =Ratings= \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" was originally broadcast on March 18, 2012, in the United States on AMC. Upon airing, the episode attained 9 million viewers and a 5.8 household rating, indicating that 5.8% of all households who watched television viewed the episode. The episode attained a 4.7 rating in the 18-49 demographic, denoting 6 million viewers, while simultaneously acquiring 3.2 million viewers in the 18-34 demographic and 5 million in the 25–54 demographic. \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" subsequently became the highest-rated cable telecast of all time demographically, amassing record ratings among adults and men between 18 and 54; this accolade was previously held by the second-season episode \\"Nebraska.\\" Similarly, it outperformed all cable programming of the day as well as the week dated March 25, obtaining significantly higher ratings than Swamp People on History and Jersey Shore on MTV. Total viewership and ratings for \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" increased dramatically from the previous episode, \\"Better Angels,\\" which attracted 6.89 million viewers and a 3.6 rating among key adults in the 18-49 group. =Critical response= Rob Salem of Toronto Star said that \\"fans who have been complaining about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers.\\" Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that \\"every single major character gets their moment to shine\\"; \\"Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television,\\" she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale \\"was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode.\\" In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, \\"We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'.\\" New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. \\"It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For the first time since last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can go so far as to say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends.\\" Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program \\"ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film.\\" Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series. Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times said that the program delivered what she described as a \\"blood bath,\\" and Aaron Rutzkoff of The Wall Street Journal further analyzed that the episode followed a dark and frenetic convention \\"with flare.\\" The Washington Post commentator Jen Chaney opined that \\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" evoked elements of various films of George Romero, as well as the historical epic film Gone with the Wind (1939). Writing for Paste, Josh Jackson issued the episode an 8.8 out of 10 rating, signifying a \\"commendable\\" rating. \\"'Beside the Dying Fire' wasted no time getting straight to the action, assuming a season’s worth of character development was more than enough.\\" The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan echoed synonymous sentiments, ultimately declaring that the telecast was the best since the series' pilot episode, \\"Days Gone Bye.\\" Ryan summated: \\"The first two acts of The Walking Dead Season 2 finale were full of excitement, honest to God suspense and characters who came up with pretty decent plans on the fly. When the braaaains finally hit the fan at Hershel Greene's farm, my pulse quickened and I found myself wondering and even caring about the survival of characters who'd done little more than irritate me for weeks.\\" Julia Rhodes from California Literary Review uttered that the show returned to form in \\"Beside the Dying Fire,\\" while Buddy TV writer Megan Cole summed up the episode as \\"intense.\\" Critics were keen to the character progression of Andrea (Laurie Holden, pictured). The character development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson felt that it served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. \\"After a season of whining, there had to have been at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot,\\" he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that \\"the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across.\\" Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: \\"She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, on the edge of my seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be.\\" The gradual alteration of Rick was frequently mentioned in the critiques. Dan Hopper of Best Week Ever theorized that such a drastic transition was attributed by the death of his friend Shane. Halden proclaimed that the progression established a strong sense of direction for the character. \\"This is a definite direction. I’m not sure if the show’s going to make Rick an out- and-out monster, or if this is setting up some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three, but it’s a strong choice. The Walking Dead has tried to make us value this group of people, as if together, they mean more than they do alone. That hasn’t worked, so now it appears we’re going to try trial by fire.\\" By the end of \\"Beside the Dying Fire,\\" Ryan concluded that \\"Rick is becoming the leader he should have been from the start, and he's being clear and upfront about his goals and leadership style.\\" Commentators were divided with the interactions between Rick and his wife Lori. Although Ryan reacted positively to Lincoln's performance, she affirmed that the contradictory nature of Lori almost ruined the scene. Similarly, Kine criticized Callies' facial expressions during the sequence. Jackson wrote, \\"If that was a challenge from the writers, though, Sarah Wayne Callies has to feel like they're just messing with her at this point. Her character, Lori, basically tells Rick that Shane needs to be put down, and then treats him like a monster when he’s forced to follow through with it.\\" References External links *\\"Beside the Dying Fire\\" at AMC * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 2) episodes ","title":"Beside the Dying Fire"},{"id":"34556788","text":"is a metro station in Chūō-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.

It is regarded by many as one of the classics. This song tells the tale of a husband and wife setting out on a train trip from Rowlands Gill, a village in County Durham, to “toon” - meaning 'town', presumably Newcastle upon Tyne - to do some shopping. The trip starts to go wrong when they miss their train. The pair end up in a pub where the wife becomes “a bit the worse for wear”. We are left to assume no shopping was done and no clothes bought.  Lyrics  = Places mentioned = *Rowlands Gill is a village situated between Winlaton Mill and Blackhill Mill, on the north bank of the River Derwent, previously in County Durham but now in Tyne and Wear, England This is the only place mentioned by name. It is not known either where they started their journey, or where they intended to do their shopping, although Newcastle upon Tyne would be an educated guess. *As Rowlands Gill was not a rail interchange, it has to be assumed that they travelled the first part of their journey by means other than rail. *The Derwent Valley Railway was started in 1865 and the line was opened on 2 December 1867. The line (part single track) ran between Blackhill and Derwenthaugh on the River Tyne where it joined the Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle rail track. *Even the name of the pubbilick hoose was not given.  Comments on variations to the above version  *In the early 19th century, as today, there were cheap books and magazines. *Many of these “chapbooks” were on poor quality paper to a poor standard and with poor quality print. *The works were copied with no thoughts of copyright, and the work required very little proof-reading, and what was done was not required to a high standard. Consequently, the dialect words of songs varied between editions. As this was a very popular song, it appeared in numerous editions. The many versions published show considerable, some very minor, variations, mainly in the spelling of the words, and sometimes variations within the same edition.

It is a stronghold from the Middle Ages, which had an important role in the defence of the local citizens. It is one of those fortresses in Háromszék County which have been built by the residents of multiple municipalities.  History  The municipality was first mentioned in a written form in 1332, under the name villa Guidonis. It was mentioned in 1420 as Gydofalva. In the registrum prepared in 1567. There is mentioned, that the village had 15 gates. Gidófalva (today Ghidfalău) has had a church since 1332. It received in this year abban az évben a pápai tizedjegyzék szerint 9 régi banálist fizettek. First church of the village was built in the 13th or 14th Century with an arch type closed sanctrum. The narrow-windowed Romanesque nave is on the ruins of the old church, and its dimensions have not changed. The building of the wall of fortress with the gates and loopholes began in the 15th or 16th century. At the same time the church was rebuilt in the Gothic style. Octagonal, domed sanctum, closed in five directions, was built in this period. It was burnt by the Tatars, but it was renovated in 1672, as is mentioned in an inscription above the main entrance. The Southern entrance was built later, during the 16th or 17th century at the time of another renovation. The arcade is from 1787. The structure of the church was damaged twice by earthquakes. Firstly in 1802, and again in 1816, when the ceiling paintings were brought down. At the first stage the tower was repaired and built further. The old balcony roof, made from shingle has been removed. At the same time a bell from 1642 has been refounded. The old organ was replaced by a new one in 1817. It was donated by LajosBartha T. and his wife, Zsuzasnna T. Jancsó. The great bell was ready in 1834 and a newer bell was founded in 1968. The Romanesque windows of the old church were removed in 1936.

About SevenMeters.net  Nine months before the COP15 was held, Jens Galschiøt, and his art workshop AIDOH (Art In Defense Of Humanism), started to debate on how to contribute to the environmental debates in Copenhagen. Shortly after, SevenMeter.net was founded. The name SevenMeters derived from the realization that the water level will rise 7 meters if the global warming will melt all the ice in Greenland. In order to show what impact the possible climate change can have to the world, the SevenMeters group established 24 kilometers of red blinking LED-lights at 7 meters height during the UN's climate summit in December 2009 in Copenhagen. The blinking LEDs were placed above the Bella Center where the climate debates were held, and they created a strong symbol of the urgency to act before the climate gets out of hand.http://sevenmeters.net/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=109%3Asevenmeters- statement&catid;=49%3Adocuments-about-the- campaign&Itemid;=85%E2%8C%A9%3Den⟨=en Statements from the SevenMeters group  Art installations  The SevenMeters movement made a series of art installations, which was displayed all over Copenhagen during the COP15 in 2009.http://www.klimadebat.dk/forum/sevenmeters-net-kunst-omkring-bella- center-i-samarbejde-med-illumenarts-dk-d18-e1160.php A danish debate site writhing about the art installations = The 7 meters line = SevenMeters covered 24 kilometers with red blinking LED-lights attached in 7 meters height during UN's climate summit.

It was originally based at the Enniskillen Courthouse, but moved to County Buildings in East Bridge Street, Enniskillen, in 1960. History Fermanagh County Council was formed under orders issued in accordance with the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 which came into effect on 18 April 1899. Elections were held using proportional representation until 1922 when it was abolished in favour of first past the post. In 1921, shortly before the partition of Ireland and transfer of power from the Dublin Castle administration, Fermanagh County Council passed a resolution on a 13–10 majority not to recognise the newly formed Parliament of Northern Ireland and pledged their allegiance to the unrecognised republican Second Dáil of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic in Southern Ireland before the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The resolution stated: \\"We, the County Council of Fermanagh, in view of the expressed desire of a large majority of people in this county, do not recognise the partition parliament in Belfast and do hereby direct our Secretary to hold no further communications with either Belfast or British Local Government Departments, and we pledge our allegiance to Dáil Éireann.\\" In response, the Royal Irish Constabulary evicted them from their council offices and confiscated official documents. As a result the council was temporarily dissolved. The council were replaced by Commissioners appointed by Sir Dawson Bates. The Council was reformed by the time of the 1924 Northern Ireland local elections. As a protest against the abolition of proportional representation nationalist parties boycotted the election, allowing unionist parties to take control of the council uncontested. Due to the abolition of proportional representation and gerrymandering, the council always had a unionist majority of councillors elected up until abolition. In 1967, the Government of Northern Ireland passed the County Fermanagh (Transfer of Functions) Order 1967. This made Fermanagh County Council amalgamate with the smaller Enniskillen Borough Council and the rural district councils in Enniskillen, Irvinestown and Lisnaskea to turn Fermanagh County Council into a unitary authority.  Later years and abolition  In 1969, the Fermanagh Civil Rights Association published a booklet criticising the council and accusing them of favouring the Protestant community over the Catholic community. Some of the accusations included that the council would deliberately hire Protestants for skilled local government and school jobs and that they proposed to build a new village for Catholics in a gerrymandered district that already had a Catholic majority. The council was abolished in accordance with the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 on 1 October 1973 and replaced by Fermanagh District Council.

From 1989 to 2008, the facility had an AstroTurf 12 surface. In 2008, renovations installed of A-Turf, which lessens the impact on athletes who play on the surface. Also in 2008, new scoreboard and baseball dugouts were added. The facility also features stadium lighting and locker rooms. In 2004, 2009, and 2011, the venue hosted the MAAC Men's Lacrosse Championships. In 2010, it hosted the MAAC Softball Championships. In May 2012, it hosted the MAAC Women's Lacrosse Championships.

Spurr has received critical acclaim for the clothing line he launched in 2006 which is credited with revitalizing and modernizing classical menswear. He is currently the creative director and designer of a shoe label called March NYC. Early life and education Simon Spurr was born and raised in Kent, England, the son of two bankers. His father's style shaped his design perspectives at an early age as Spurr discussed in a 2011 interview: In a 2010 interview, Spurr explained his journey into what would become his career: Spurr went on to study Men’s Fashion Design at Middlesex University and graduated in 1996. Career Upon graduation Spurr was hired to design menswear for Yves Saint Laurent, working under acclaimed designer Hedi Slimane. He recounted working with Slimane in a 2010 interview: “One of the strongest memories I remember from working with Hedi, was him telling us to throw away the ‘trend books’ that are often used as guidance for younger designers. Set vision, don’t follow trend.” This left a lasting influence on the designer's approach to design: \\"I appreciate, I look, I listen, but on the whole I completely disengage from the rest of what's going on in fashion. I have a feeling, an emotion, that comes out in the form of clothes.\\" From YSL, Spurr was recruited by cK Calvin Klein in 2001 to be the head menswear designer, based in New York City. In 2003, he was named Design Director for Polo Ralph Lauren's Purple Label and Black Label ranges. During his tenure at Ralph Lauren, Spurr made the decision to start his own company; \\"I needed to make the choice between putting my feet under the table and enjoying the financial rewards associated with foreseeable promotion [at Ralph Lauren], or take an educated gamble and try to create something that would allow me to have freedom down the road for a family. It felt like my last chance to get out of the corporate world.\\" Spurr launched his menswear line, SPURR, in 2006 with American-made selvedge denim jeans. The line was immediately picked up by Bergdorf Goodman in New York City. In 2007, the line expanded to include sportswear, suiting, and accessories, establishing a full lifestyle brand. In 2009, the brand broadened even further with the creation of SIMON SPURR, a designer collection made entirely in Italy. Spurr described the clientele he designs for in a 2011 interview: “I design for a man that has awareness of life, culture, proportion and design. A diverse man that understands quality but also has a strong idea of his own sensibility.” After several well received presentations, Spurr held his first fashion show during New York’s Fall ’10 Fashion Week, in February 2010. Following the success of the shows and critical acclaim, Spurr was named creative consultant for the Tommy Hilfiger men's runway collection in November 2010. Spurr has been touted for revitalizing the men's three-piece suit which includes his signature eight- button vest. He explained his thoughts on this in a 2011 interview: \\"Because [the vest] has this corset-like feel, it gives you better posture and you really feel you’re wearing something tailor-made and handcrafted.\\" This aesthetic is inspired by a variety of influences, one specifically not straying far from his British roots; \\"Tommy Nutter was an avant-garde tailor on Britain's Savile Row in the 60's /70's. He took the conventional notion of a bespoke 3 piece suit and turned it on its head using bold scales and mixing patterns. For me it [is] more about the notion of altering one's perception of the stereotypical image of the suit... The menswear that I make at SIMON SPURR is modern, elegant and yet carries a fresh spirit. I am bringing a very English look to New York Fashion week with a strong blend of style, functionality and also wearability. Ultimately, I think it’s my British roots that allows SIMON SPURR to stand alone in the American market.\\" Spurr's label was embraced by celebrities, many of whom wore his suits as he discussed in a November 2011 interview: \\"Simon Spurr [the brand], has hit its stride, so to speak. I think it’s really starting to resonate with the public. It’s always done well inside the world of fashion, but I think that the exceptional number of celebrity dressing we've done over the past year has really helped spread the word. There’s a whole new wave of American actors who are finding a new wave of American designers, and I happen to be one of them who does red carpet suiting quite well.\\" In January 2012, Spurr merged his two lines, SPURR and SIMON SPURR, to create a more expansive collection under the SIMON SPURR moniker. In March 2012, Spurr received a nomination for best menswear designer of the year from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, but abruptly announced that he was departing from his eponymous label just two days later. The New York Times attributed the split between Spurr and the investors that financed the label to a desire by the investors to make the label more commercial and less exclusive, something that the SPURR diffusion line hadn't been able to achieve. He is currently the creative director and designer of a shoe label called March NYC.

His most famous song is arguably \\"Wor Nanny’s a mazer\\". He was known as \\"The Pitman Poet\\" or \\"The Bard of the Northern Coalfield\\".  Early life  Tommy Armstrong was born in Wood Street, Shotley Bridge, County Durham, on 15 August 1848. Armstrong was of very short stature, and very bow legged (thought to be caused by rickets when young) and this caused him to have problems all his life, including using a walking stick when older. He started work in the mines at the age of 9 as a trapper boy, and at the age of 12 had progressed to a \\"pony boy\\". He worked at various collieries in the area including Tanfield Lea colliery, near Stanley, and also worked at the collieries at Addison, East Tanfield, and Tanfield Moor.  Later life  Tommy Armstrong was married in 1869 to a Mary Ann Hunter in 1869 and they had 14 children. Ann died in 1898 and Tommy remarried in 1901 to a widow named Ann Thompson. He lived most of his life at Tanfield Lea, although he is known to have also lived in East Tanfield, Iveston, Tanfield, Tantobie and Whitley Bay. A book of 26 of his popular songs was published but it is thought that much of his work was lost. His works were printed at the time on chapbooks and broadsheets which sold for a halfpenny or a penny each. He moved for a time in 1902 to Whitley Bay where he worked for a period as a Newsagent. He died on 30 August 1920 at the age of 72 years at Havelock Terrace, Tantobie.  Works  The material varies between the humorous \\"Wor Nanny’s a mazer\\" to the attack on \\"Dirty Kaiser Bill\\".

The title is a Kinect motion-sensing based title for the Xbox 360 and was released via the Xbox Live Arcade service in North America on February 1, 2012. Happy Action Theater is based on an idea that Double Fine's founder, Tim Schafer, had on devising a game that Lily, his two-year-old daughter (at the time), could play with. To this, the open-ended game is a collection of eighteen different modes that allow multiple players to interact in unique ways through the Kinect cameras and motion-sensing in an augmented reality shown on the console's display, such as playing in a giant virtual ball pit or walking through simulated lava. Gameplay Happy Action Theater is an open-ended game, providing eighteen different modes that incorporate features of the Kinect motion-sensing and camera system. Players can select any one of the eighteen modes, or opt to have the game randomly select modes and cycle through them every few minutes. The game can support the tracking of up to 6 players. Within most modes there are no goals, only to perform certain actions for the Kinect as to create humorous results in a form of augmented reality on the console's display. For example, one mode simulates a flow of lava that fills the player's room on the game's screen, and depicts the player within it. From here, the player can kick at rocks that float on the lava, interact with small animated flame sparks that jump around, or by \\"immersing\\" themselves in the lava, can have their hands temporarily shoot fireballs to \\"wipe out\\" other players on screen for a short period of time. Another mode simulates Space Invaders, with the players required to hold their hands up and move about as to destroy attacking forces on screen; while a score is kept, the mode is endless. The game does include a limited number of achievements for certain actions. Development Happy Action Theater was originally announced in October 2011 as Double Fine's next project after their Kinect-based Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster project. Schafer had found that in playing Kinect games with Lily, his 2-year-old daughter at the time, that her patience and behavior would often cause havoc with the Kinect system, caused by both limitations of the Kinect systems and the hard rules of the specific game. Schafer envisioned the concept of Happy Action Theater as to create the simplest playing experience possible such that his daughter could play it without help. Schafer's idea for the approach to Happy Action Theater was partially inspired by interactive advertisements at malls which would react to people passing in from them. In following this, Happy Action Theater was developed more like a toy or playmate rather than a game, having it react to whatever the players in front of the sensor was doing without adding any conformity. To create the game's concept, Double Fine had to strip out many normal aspects of a video game and avoided added extraneous features, as to make the game \\"more like interactive experiences\\", according to Drew Skillman, the technical artist for Double Fine. Schafer wanted to avoid over-thinking any aspect of the project: the team did add the idea of Xbox Achievements, but Schafer avoided adding any more features as he felt that the more open game is \\"very powerful when you put kids in front of it and see how much they’re able to make out of it\\". Skillman admits that they could have spent time developing any one of the activities into a more elaborate experience, but felt the simpler approach was appropriate for the game. Double Fine's team used a rapid prototyping concept to try out new modes, spending a few days to program the activity and then testing it out to see if it could be expanded upon. Several additional modes were brainstormed in this manner, including modes designed to a specific number of players, but were not further developed. Further ideas were dropped when they encountered technical limitations of the Kinect hardware, such as placing fog in the augmented reality. Some ideas were actually implemented into a mode, but during playtesting, the team found that these were not as enjoyable as they originally had thought, while other ideas came from playing with various graphics effects and expanding it out to a full mode. The \\"Lava\\" mode of Happy Action Theater. Double Fine's team found that children were more apt to \\"play\\" in the lava than to try to avoid it. Double Fine performed internal playtesting, leaving the game running in a conference room to allow anyone passing to try it, and brought in friends and families with young children to try it out. Microsoft Game Studios also assisted with playtesting, providing Double Fine with live feeds of weekly testing sessions with children and their parents playing with the game. Testing with children was found to be important, as the children would identify new ways of playing with the modes that the team would later incorporate. In the lava mode, Schafer and his team originally envisioned that children would play \\"avoid the lava\\", standing and stepping between furniture to avoid stepping in it. Instead, when they tested the mode with children, the children played in the virtual lava, leading the team to add additional responses to these actions for the game. Some of the Achievements for the game resulted from watching these new interactions by children. The development team found that capturing the virtual physical interactions that would occur with the activity was more important than setting up predetermined behavior, as it would lead to more natural actions and enjoyment from players; for example, as long as they provided the appropriate physical nature of a ball pit, players \\"instinctively know the \\"right\\" thing to do. \\"Jump into it!\\" according to Skillman. Despite the aim for children, the Double Fine team found the game to appeal to \\"three- year-olds or college dorm rooms full of drunken 20-year-olds\\". Happy Action Theater was developed by only six people at Double Fine, compared with their four \\"Amnesia Fortnight\\" projects which had around 12 members per team. Schafer stated the project was built on a much smaller budget than their other games, meant to be run at a small scale. They were able to secure some funding to develop the basic prototype, and from that, got additional funding and support from Microsoft Game Studios to complete the project. Unlike the other \\"Amnesia Fortnight\\" projects, where Schafer let other developers take the lead while he pursued a more creative consulting role, Happy Action Theater is Schafer's first game as creative lead since Brütal Legend. Double Fine built on their previous Kinect work from Once Upon a Monster to fully integrate the features of the hardware device into the game, and wanted to avoid any mode that could have simply been done with a camera such as the EyeToy. Because of their focus on the title as a toy rather than a game, they did not have to worry about technical accuracy, simplify the programming effort as well as avoiding some of the technical issues with the latency of the Kinect device. Schafer noted one example in the lava activity that it was more satisfying having the game respond to the player kicking at the lava than to have the splash height be accurate. They opted to use Kinect's six-player silhouette tracking instead of the more accurate two-player skeleton tracking feature as to allow more player to be involved; they used this information from the Kinect to create \\"blob\\" representations of the players that could be used to track motions for the various activities. They also utilized the depth and sound perception to create modes and effects around those elements, such as one mode that allows players to \\"interact\\" with previously snapped-photos of themselves spatially. The team also developed ways to analyze the background of the player's setting to allow them to alter the appearance of a player on screen, such as by erasing them or lifting them off-screen, filling in the missing space with the previously-analyzed background. A further technical challenge was to create effective lighting of the players' images on the screen, such as when they are holding a simulated firework in their hand, and incorporating their shadows onto other virtual props as to provide better immersion in the game. Double Fine announced that a sequel, titled Kinect Party, is expected to release within 2012, featuring more activities; owners of Happy Action Theater will be able to unlock those original activities within the sequel. The game includes new modes, such as one where players can don virtual costumes (including ones based on Minecraft), create and destroy castles, and perform as if they were in a dubstep video. The sequel also introduces the ability to take and share photos from the various game modes. Reception Double Fine Happy Action Theater was recognized by reviewers as a different experience that most game players, adults and older children, would expect, and recognized that the game was very well suited to younger children. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer reviewed the game through the eyes of his daughter, and well appreciated the efforts Double Fine had gone to give children full control of the game and avoids setting preconceived notions of game expectations, giving children the ability to explore with their imaginations, \\"make games in their head from the things around them\\". Similarly, IGN's Casey Lynch reviewed the game with his two sons, who both enjoyed many of the activities offered and the chance to find \\"secret things\\" within each of the activities. Lynch noted that \\"The game aims to provide instant fun from the moment it's turned on, with as little barrier to entry as possible.\\" Both reviewers and their children noted that not all the modes will be fun to all players, but with the Director mode cycling between stages every few minutes, no one activity gets too boring. Critics also noted that while the game is targeted to children, it would still work for older groups as a contrast to typical motion-sensing games, while the game would otherwise get monotonous and lack any reason to replay when engaged as a single player. Mathieu Marunczyn and Emily Ford at Jackson School in Victoria, Australia, who teach autistic children, found that Happy Action Theater was a benefit to the students, as it would engage them in sensory input and social interaction with their other students through the virtualization of the various activities in the game.

Cast members were all veterans of the New York theater, including Russell Oberlin and Broadway actor Maurice Edwards. While with The Lark Ascending, Bogen began to fashion works in which she rhythmically synchronized her digitized photos to readings of poetry or performances of New Music. Her works in this vein are published online on Vimeo and videoart.net: Textur, with music by Austrian composer Katharina Klement; Kassandra, a Reverie, with music by Roumanian composer Dinu Ghezzo; Black on Black / 13, with music by American composer Richard Brooks; Going...gone, with music by American composer John Bilotta; the farce A Noiseless, Patient Spider, with Russell Oberlin as the reader, Blackie the Blackbird as the Spider, and Schubert's \\"Die Forelle\\" arranged for vocal quartet; and Against the Cold, with music by American composer Joseph Pehrson. Also on vimeo are: My Country 'Tis, with music by American composer Harold Seletsky; Licorice Moments with music by American composer Hubert Howe; Verlaine Variations with music by American composer Elodie Lauten; and Mein Lebenslauf by Georg Schoenberg, oldest son of Arnold Schoenberg by his first wife Mathilde von Zemlinsky. A lifelong New Yorker and a resident of Greenwich Village since the 1970s, Bogen is married to Arnold Greissle-Schönberg, oldest living grandson of composer Arnold Schönberg. Her husband is the nephew of Georg Schönberg, also a composer, whose musical works Bogen premiered through the years at The Lark Ascending events and has vigorously tried to promote in other ways. She is the “author with” of the English version of Arnold Greissle-Schönberg’s biography. Works by Nancy Bogen =Books= ;Fiction :Klytaimnestra Who Stayed at Home. Roanoke, Va: Lintel, 1988 (cloth).

Health indicators According to the 2005 National Family Health Survey, only a small proportion of Kolkata households are covered under any health scheme or health insurance. The total fertility rate in Kolkata is 1.4, which is the lowest among the cities surveyed. In Kolkata, 77 percent of the married women use contraceptive, which is the highest among the cities surveyed; but use of modern contraceptive methods is the lowest (46 percent). Infant mortality rate in Kolkata is 41 per 1000 live births, and mortality rate for children below five is 49 per 1000 live births. Among the surveyed cities, Kolkata stands second (5 percent), where the children have not received any vaccination under Universal Immunization Programme. Kolkata stands second among the surveyed cities, with 57 percent of the children between 0 and 71 months has the reach to an anganwadi centre under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme.Percentage of malnutrition, anemic and underweight children in Kolkata is less in comparison to other surveyed cities. Diseases About 30 percent of the women and 18 percent of the men in Kolkata are obese. Kolkata has the highest percentage (55 percent) of woman who are having anaemia among the surveyed cities, while 20 percent of the men in Kolkata are anaemic. Large number of people suffers from diseases like diabetes, asthma, goitre and other thyroid disorders. Tropical diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya are prevalent in Kolkata, though their incidence is decreasing. Health infrastructure As of 2010, there are 48 government hospitals, mostly under the Department of Health & Family Welfare, Government of West Bengal, and 366 private medical establishments during 2010. For every 10,000 people in the city, there are 61 hospital beds, which is higher than the national average of 9 hospital beds per 10,000. Ten medical colleges are located in the Kolkata metropolitan area which act as tertiary referral hospitals in the state. Calcutta Medical College, founded in 1835, was the first Asian institution to teach modern medicine. These facilities are inadequate to meet the healthcare needs of the city. More than 78 percent in Kolkata prefer the private medical sector over public medical sector, due to the poor quality of care, the lack of a nearby facility, and excessive waiting times at government facilities. =Medical colleges= *Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, College Street *Nil Ratan Sarkar Medical College and Hospital, Sealdah *R.G.Kar Medical College, Belgachia *Calcutta National Medical College, Beniapukur *S.S.K.M.

A. Fyfe n.d. Robert Alexander Fyfe (October 20, 1816 in Saint-Philippe, Quebec – September 4, 1878 in Woodstock, Ontario) was a strong church builder, writer, and first Principal of the Canadian Literary Institute (later Woodstock College). Background Robert Alexander Fyfe was the son of James Fyfe a Scottish Immigrant from Dundee, Scotland. Fyfe’s educational advantages were few, and he was obliged at an early age to work for his living.[The Scot in British North America] p. 843'. Fyfe married Jane Maclerie Thomson (b. April 12, 1815 Scotland d. December, 1847 Toronto) on February 17, 1843 at First Baptist Church, Montréal, Québec. Two sons were born who died in infancy. Fyfe remarried to Rebecca Smith Kendall (b. 1815 d. May 22, 1884 Woodstock, Ontario) of Brookline, Massachusetts in August 15, 1848. He was buried beside his first wife and children in the Toronto Necropolis. Education Fyfe was determined to enter the ministry and in the fall of 1835 he entered into courses at Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution in Hamilton, New York (later Madison University then Colgate University). He applied himself so assiduously as to permanently injure his health leaving in April 1836. Commencing in the fall of 1836 Fyfe began studies at the newly formed Canada Baptist College in Montréal. Subsequently, for the 1837-1838 school year he renewed his studies at the Worcester Manual Labor High School in Worcester, Massachusetts in preparation for further theological studies. Beginning in October 1839 Fyfe commenced studies at Newton Theological Seminary Andover Newton Theological School in Newton, Massachusetts. On August 25, 1842 Fyfe was ordained at Brookline, Massachusetts. At some later date the degree of Doctor of Divinity, D.D. was conferred. Pastorates During September, 1842 Fyfe began a pastorate at First Baptist Church in Perth, Ontario helping it to be officially organized later that year. He served until the fall of 1843 when he became Principal of Canada Baptist College in Montréal for one year serving until the fall of 1844. Beginning in September, 1844 until September, 1848 Fyfe became the pastor of Bond Street Baptist Church in Toronto, Ontario. Fyfe did much to help bring cohesion and stability to the many divergent background variations of the immigrants who comprised the membership especially over the issue of close communion. Commencing in September 1848 Fyfe returned to Perth to take up the pastorate there again but left around October 1849. Shortly thereafter, upon invitation of the Baptist church in Warren, Rhode Island he preached and accepted the pastorate serving until June, 1853. Beginning in November, 1853 Fyfe served at the First Baptist Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin until September 1855. Commencing in October, 1855 to 1860 Fyfe returned to pastor Bond Street Baptist Church. In 1860 he left to become the first principal at Woodstock College (then Canadian Literary Institute). Accomplishments In 1859, with a friend, Fyfe had purchased the Christian Messenger (which had begun in 1854) a denominational paper published in Brantford, and made its place of publication Toronto, renaming it the Canadian Baptist in 1860. He provided outstanding editorship until 1863 Dictionary of Canadian Biography. \\"Fyfe, Robert Alexander\\" Fyfe also wrote a book The Teaching of the New Testament In Regard To the Soul; And the Nature of Christ's Kingdom in 1859 which espoused the traditional amillennial view. Under Fyfe's leadership mission services were begun in the western part of the Toronto. This mission eventually grew into the Beverley Street Baptist Church. At some point Fyfe also served on the board of the Upper Canada Religious Tract and Book Society (founded in 1832 in Toronto, Ontario). Fyfe was a very articulate opponent of the system of the Clergy reserve. He was also a strong proponent of allowing more than one denomination to have schools of higher learning. Teaching During the fall of 1843 he became Principal of Canada Baptist College in Montréal for one year serving until the fall of 1844. Commencing in 1860 until his death in 1878 Fyfe served as Principal of Woodstock College (then Canadian Literary Institute). Beliefs Fyfe was Calvinistic but not of the strict sort. Fyfe was a firm believer in the stricter communion practice of close communion. References Bibliography * Robertson, John Ross, (1904). Landmarks of Toronto, Volume 4, pp 431–432. * Rattray, W.

His Historische Beschreibung der edlen Sing- und Klingkunst...von Anfang der Welt bis auf unserer Zeit (which in English means: Historical description of the noble art of singing and instrumental music ... from the beginning of the world until our time) was the first history of music written in Germany.Collins Encyclopedia of Music Page 431-432  Life  Printz was the son of a forester in Oberpfalz. He had hardly any training before he enrolled in 1659 in Altdorf, near Nuremberg. A musical aptitude is likely but undocumented. He broke the undefined Altdorfer study time and soon abandoned it to work as a tutor. This employment limited his ability to travel. At the age of 21 in 1662 he moved to Dresden, where he became Kapellmeister at the court of the arts-friendly Silesian magnate Count Erdmann I. He traveled with his new employer, even to Bohemian and Hungarian military camps. After the count's death in 1664 he accepted a position as cantor at the Sorau church, started a family and spent the next 52 years as a composer and musicologicist. Similar to Johann Kuhnau, he released several popular musical compositions alongside novels.

Biography Narimura was the second son of Date Shigemura by a concubine. His childhood name was Shikisaburo (式三郎) later Shojiro (総次郎) later become Date Tokimura, and he became heir on the death of his elder brother in 1783. At the time of his genpuku ceremony in 1787, he received a kanji from Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari and became Date Narimura. He also received court rank of Junior Fourth, Lower Grade and the courtesy titles of Mimasaka-no-kami and Jijū (chamberlain) at that time. In 1790, he became daimyō on the retirement of his father, and his title was changed to Mutsu-no-kami and Sakonoe-shōshō. In 1793, he married the daughter of the kampaku Takatsukasa Sukehira, who was the elder sister of Emperor Kōkaku. The year 1796 was not a good year for Sendai Domain. Narimura's wife died due to complications in childbirth of his eldest son. He shortly afterwards he received word of his father's death at the clan residence in Edo. On his way back to Sendai after the funeral, he fell ill near Shirakawa, and died shortly after returning home to Aoba Castle at the age of 23. As his heir Date Chikamune was still an infant and his second son (by a concubine), Date Narimune was still in his mother's womb, the domain took over a week to inform the authorities of Narimura's death, so that they could ensure that Narimune was posthumously recognised as Narimura's official son, and second in the line-of-succession.

Somewhat similar to single malt whiskey, the style was defined by its inclusion of unmalted raw barley in the mash in addition to malt. However, small amounts of raw oats or wheat may have been used at times. This unmalted component is said to give single pot whiskey a \\"spicier bristle\\" and \\"thicker texture\\" than the otherwise similar single malt whiskeys. If the whiskey is not distilled completely on the site of a single distillery, then it may be termed pot still whiskey but not single pot still whiskey. Once the most popular type of whiskey in the world, this style of whiskey was historically referred to as pure pot still whiskey, Irish-style pot still whiskey, or – especially in Ireland – simply as pot still whiskey. The term \\"single pot still\\" was only introduced in recent years to overcome the United States Tax and Trade Bureau's objections to the use of the term \\"pure\\" in the labelling of food and drink. The term should not be confused with the theoretical concept of whiskey produced solely in a pot still (which would also apply to single malt whiskey as well as some examples of pot still bourbon and rye whiskey).  Science of Pot Still Distillation  To separate components from a mixture of liquids, the liquid can be heated to force components, which have different boiling points, into the gas phase. The wash is poured into a still, usually made of copper, and heated using steam. The wash consists of many chemicals, malted barley, alcohol, water, and sugar. The alcohol, along with some other chemicals, needs to be separated. By using steam to heat the still, alcohol and some volatile chemicals are evaporated first. As the gas travels upwards, it is directed sent into another tube around which cold water is constantly flowing. After the gas travels through the cold tube, the gas is condensed back into a liquid and collected in a separate vessel. Depending on how the wash is turned in the still, different chemicals (aldehydes, esters, higher alcohols, and a number of other substances in very small amounts) are evaporated. A rummerger is used to constantly stir the wash to prevent burning of solid particles. After the first wash, there is still 6-7% solids from the barley in the wash. During the heating process, kinetic energy increases (molecules move faster) until they start to change phases. Then entropy increases from the phase change. In the cooling pipe, kinetic energy and entropy both decrease resulting in another phase change from gas to liquid. In this process, not all of the solids are removed and some make it through the first distillation process.  History  A bottle of Redbreast 12 Year Old, bearing the older description \\"Pure pot still\\". Newer bottles are labelled \\"Single pot still\\".Whiskey has been distilled in Ireland since at least the 1400s and most likely as early as the 6th century. Single pot still whiskey emerged as a means of avoiding a tax introduced in 1785 on the use of malted barley. Although this tax was later repealed, the popularity of the style endured until the emergence of blends in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 19th century, single pot still whiskey was the most popular style of whiskey in the world and formed the bulk of Ireland's whiskey exports. However, with the rise of cheaper, milder blended whiskeys in the 20th century, single pot still whiskey declined in popularity, and many formerly all-pot-still brands changed their production to become blends. By 1980, only two specialist bottlings remained in existence, Green Spot and Redbreast, with one in danger of being discontinued. However, in recent years, a resurgence in whiskey distilling in Ireland has led to the launch of several new single pot still whiskeys.  Legal definition  In addition to the general regulations governing the production of Irish whiskey (e.g., geographical origin, aging in wooden casks for a minimum of three years), Irish government regulations stipulate that Irish pot still whiskey must be: * Distilled from a mash of a combination of malted barley, unmalted barley, and other unmalted cereals * Distilled in a pot still so that the distillate has the aroma and taste of the materials used * Made with a minimum of 30% malted barley and 30% unmalted barley In addition, the regulation documents state that: * Up to 5% of cereals other than malted and unmalted barley, such as oats and rye, may be used * Either double or triple distillation may be used, although traditionally most Irish pot still whiskey is triple distilled * The term \\"single\\" can be added if the Irish pot still whiskey is distilled on the site of a single distillery  Whiskeys  As of 2018, there are a handful of single pot still whiskeys on the market. However, due to the construction of several new distilleries in Ireland in recent years, several more single pot whiskeys are expected to be released in the coming years. Those available as of mid-2018 include: * Dingle Single Pot Still (released in late 2017) * Green Spot, Yellow Spot, and Red Spot * Method & Madness Single Pot Still * Midleton (Barry Crockett Legacy, Dair Ghaelach) * Powers (Three Swallows, Signature Release, John's Lane) * Redbreast (12, 12 Cask Strength, 15, 21, Lustau Edition) *Teeling Single Pot Still (released in August 2018)  References  =Notes= =Bibliography= * bostonapothecary.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/11/the-application-of-chemistry-to-pot-still- distillation1.pdf * https://www.whisky.com/information/knowledge/production/details/the-scottish- pot-stills.html * https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-distillation-601964 *  External links  * Single Pot Still Single Pot Still whiskey portal run by Irish Distillers.

Plot Paulie is having a pretend tea party with his sister and his doll in the garden while his father and mother watch from inside the house. Paulie's father, Jim, is annoyed that his son is wearing his mother's dress and takes him to Dougie O'Neill to buy a ferret so that they can go rabbit hunting. Paulie picks a ferret and calls him \\"Mickey\\". Jim takes his son into the countryside in the rain to find a rabbit burrow. Jim tells Paulie to release the ferret who scares the rabbits out of the burrow and into a net where he hits them with a shovel. Paulie is upset when he learns that the true meaning of hunting is to \\"kill bunnie rabbits\\". They arrive home with a table full of dead rabbits, to which Jim's wife complains what she is to do with them. He tells her to make rabbit stew. When Jim goes to the shed, Paulie tells him that he fed Mickey éclairs so he isn't hungry anymore and so won't have to kill any more rabbits. At dinner, Paulie refuses to eat the rabbit meat and runs out to the shed. When Jim confronts Paulie he tells him to put Mickey back in his cage and go finish his food; but Paulie refuses and tells him to do it himself while holding the ferret up to him. Jim is actually scared of handling Mickey and backs up knocking some petrol cans over, causing the ferret to bite Paulie on the lip. While returning the ferret to Dougie O'Neill, Jim realises that he was the one that lost his nerve with the ferret and it was his intolerance that caused Paulie to getting injured. Back in the garden, Paulie is upset about losing Mickey when Jim sits beside him and invites him on a fishing trip. When Paulie declines, he says \\"You'll need this then, I suppose...\\" and hands him his doll, and the two sit together and have a pretend tea party.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets from 2013 to 2020. Known for his defensive prowess, he won the National League Gold Glove Award in 2014. Early life Lagares grew up in a cool, mountainous area in Constanza, Dominican Republic. There were few baseball facilities or teams in the area so Lagares grew up playing softball. He has credited his arm strength to his background in throwing the larger, heavier softball. Lagares did not transition to playing baseball until he was already a teenager. After only seven or eight months practicing at a baseball academy, he was signed as a shortstop by the New York Mets. Professional career =New York Mets= Lagares was signed by the New York Mets as a non-drafted free agent on May 5, 2006. Lagares was moved from shortstop to the outfield in 2009. He was assigned to the DSL Mets in 2006, wherein 57 games, he hit .255/.339/.412 with 18 XBH, 33 RBI and 12 SB. Lagares was promoted to Single-A Savannah for 2007, wherein 83 games, he hit .210/.262/.317 with 20 XBH, 16 RBI, and 11 SB. After an arm issue occurred, his 2008 debut, with Savannah, happened in late June. After 46 games with Savannah, Lagares was demoted to Low-A Brooklyn in the middle of August. In 65 total games, he hit .253/.284/.352 with 3 HR and 24 RBI. Lagares began 2009 with Savannah, but a wrist injury suffered in late May ended most of his season.

Lagares began 2010 with Savannah, and after hitting .300/.318/.459 with 5 HR, 39 RBI and 18 SB in 67 games, he was promoted to High-A St. Lucie, but was limited to 33 games thereafter a fractured ankle ended his season on July 28. 2011 was a breakout season for Lagares. He began with St. Lucie, where he tore it up before being promoted to Double-A Binghamton. In 120 games total, he hit .349/.383/.500 with 9 HR, 71 RBI and 15 SB. Lagares was added to the Mets 40 man roster on November 18, 2011. He played 2012 with Binghamton, wherein 130 games, he hit .283/.334/.389 with 4 HR, 48 RBI and 21 SB. Lagares began 2013 with Triple-A Las Vegas as their center fielder, where he played in 17 games before getting called to New York. =2013= On April 23, Lagares was called up by the Mets with Kirk Nieuwenhuis being sent down to the 51s. Lagares made his debut on the same day against the Los Angeles Dodgers coming in as a part of a double switch in the fifth inning. In the bottom of the seventh inning he recorded his first hit, a single, off Paco Rodriguez. Lagares hit his first major league home run on May 19, against Travis Wood of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. For the week of July 15–21, 2013, Lagares won the NL Player of the Week Award. In that week, Lagares hit .700 with a home run and 5 RBI. In 121 games for the Mets, he hit .242/.281/.352 with 4 HR and 34 RBI. Lagares had a .983 fielding percentage, as well as leading the MLB in assists at center field (14), defensive runs saved (26) and the NL in Range Factor/9 innings at center field (2.98). On August 20, Lagares ranked second among center fielders in Defensive Runs Saved with 20 behind Carlos Gómez with 27. In September, he was named MLB's best defender for the month of August. He led the majors with 12 defensive runs saved and led the National League, and ranked second in the majors, in outfield assists with 12. He set the Mets franchise rookie record with 15 outfield assists. His 3.5 dWAR was second only to Brewers outfielder Carlos Gomez (4.6) among National League center fielders. He was named as the Mets best defensive player during Wilson's Defensive Player of the Year Awards. Lagares finished the 2013 season appearing in 121 games with a batting average of .242 in 392 at-bats in 421 plate appearances while compiling 95 hits, 34 RBIs, 4 home runs, 20 walks, 35 runs scored and striking out 96 times. In December, he played in the Dominican Professional Baseball League for the Águilas Cibaeñas ultimately winning the Rookie of the Year award. He hit .342 with one HR, 16 RBI, five stolen bases and seven walks in 114 at-bats. =2014= Lagares made the Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2014. On April 14, he left due to an injury during a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Lagares grabbed his hamstring after beating out a double play in the seventh inning. The next day he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a pulled right hamstring. He was batting .314 with a .345 OBP, five extra base hits and seven RBIs in the 13 games. He was recalled from rehabbing with the 51s on May 1. In mid-May, Mets fans on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook became frustrated with manager Terry Collins sitting Lagares on the bench since coming off the disabled list. As of May 16, he was benched for the fourth time in five games. Mets fans soon started a campaign called #FreeLagares to express their anger over him being benched. Although Lagares had been struggling since coming back from the disabled list, however his defensive capability and clutch hitting was touted as being reason enough for him to be put in the lineup. On June 2, he was placed again on the disabled list with a right intercostal strain. On June 26, Wilmer Flores was sent down to the 51s to make room for Lagares coming of the disabled list. On September 23, he was shut down for the rest of the season with a sprained elbow. At the end of the season he improved his hitting over the past season, increasing his average by nearly 40 points, from .242 to .281. Lagares finished the 2014 season appearing in 116 games with a batting average of .281 in 416 at-bats in 452 plate appearances while compiling 117 hits, 47 RBIs, 4 home runs, 20 walks, 46 runs scored and striking out 87 times. On November 4, it was announced that he had won his first Gold Glove Award. He was the third outfielder in franchise history to win a Gold Glove award, the others being Tommie Agee (1970) and Carlos Beltrán (2006-08). He also won the Fielding Bible Award as the statistically best defensive center fielder in the National League. =2015= On April 2, Lagares and the Mets agreed to a four-year extension worth $23 million which will run from 2016 through 2019. The Mets have a $9.5 million option for 2020, with a $500,000 buyout. Lagares made the team out of spring training as the starting center fielder. On July 31, the Mets traded for Yoenis Céspedes, who would play center regularly throughout the season. Lagares moved to backup outfield role, regularly coming in as defensive substitution late in the game. Lagares finished the 2015 season appearing in 143 games batting .259./.289/.358 in 441 at-bats in 465 plate appearances while compiling 114 hits, 41 RBIs, 6 home runs, 16 walks, 47 runs scored and striking out 87 times. In the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he hit .429 in 4 games while compiling 3 hits, 2 doubles, 1 walk and scoring 3 runs.

On June 16 the Mets placed Lagares on the disabled list due to a sprained left thumb he had suffered while making a diving catch in a game on June 4. He again went on the 15-day disabled list from July 29-September 16 for his sprained left thumb, and then had surgery on August 1 to repair a torn ligament in his thumb. For the season, he batted .239/.301/.380. =2017= Lagares battled injuries but contributed to the Mets with 58 starts and 252 at bats.

It was located on land immediately to the south of Elson Creek, to which it was connected by a sluice. Fort Elson was the most northerly fort in the line of five which formed part of the ‘Sea Front and Spithead Defences’, Inner Line, Land Front, Left Flank. This line of forts was later known as the Gomer- Elson Line or 'Gosport Advanced Line' This consisted of, from south to north, Fort Gomer, Fort Grange, Fort Rowner, Fort Brockhurst and Fort Elson. Work began on Fort Elson in 1855. The estimated cost of Fort Elson was £63,740 with the actual cost £61,180.http://www.victorianforts.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/elson.pdf Victorian Forts data sheet Victorian Forts and Artillery; Data sheet on Fort Elson Construction Fort Elson was commenced in 1855 and completed in 1860. Fort Elson was already in existence when the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom decided to complete the line of fortifications to the west of Gosport inner defences so technically it is neither a Palmerston Fort nor a Royal Commission Fort. The Commission decided to incorporate Fort Elson and Fort Gomer into the defences by adding three identical forts between them to form the Gosport Advanced Line.Report of the Commissioner’s appointed to consider the defences of the United Kingdom, together with minutes of evidence, appendices and correspondence relating to the site of an internal arsenal. 22.8.1859. The method of construction was to build brick arches, similar to a railway viaduct, forming the main ramparts and then to pour earth on top allowing this to fall back through the arches, allowing it to be carried away a returned to the top once more, until the whole of the scarp rested upon their ends and the parapet was supported by the arches. This method was known as 'escarp en décharge'. It proved difficult and during the construction a major portion of the escarp slipped into the ditch during one night. Layout Fort Elson top plan 1893 The fort consists of a D-shaped rampart for the main armament with the rear (or gorge) closed by a barrack block. This is surrounded by a wet ditch, although it proved difficult to retain water in half of this so a sluice was built to connect the northern section to Fareham Creek (part of Portsmouth Harbour). The front face is a short one with two long flanks, all three having earth ramps up which the main armament and supplementary movable armament could be moved into position. The main magazine is beneath the salient of the front face and left flank accessed by a tunnel from the central parade.National Archive: Plans of Fort Elson held in WORK 43/658 to 663 The barrack block had accommodation for one field officer, eleven officers and three hundred and two N.C.O.s and men. There were stables for two horses.R.E. and R.A.

This was supplemented by two machine guns. In 1900 it was proposed to remove all remaining armament and by 1901 and the fort served no further purpose in the defence line.National Archive: Armament returns for 1900 and 1901 held in WO33 In use The armament of the fort was maintained during its active period by various companies from the Garrison Artillery, as were all of the Gosport Forts, the H.Q. being in Fort Rowner.Various edition of The Army Lists from 1870 to 1900 It was also used by The Royal Artillery Militia during its annual 28-day embodiments in the years from 1853 to 1894.http://www.victorianforts.co.uk/rga.htm Manning the Portsmouth Forts In 1917 the fort was given a new lease of life when an early QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun on a Peerless lorry was stationed there.

In 1940 during the Battle of France, Israël, a French Jew, was called up to service in the same reconnaissance wing in which Antoine de Saint-Exupéry would serve. Israël was shot down and presumed killed during a fierce aerial engagement, but in fact parachuted to safety and was quickly captured by the Germans. He was sent to a German prisoner-of-war camp in Lübeck, where he remained for the duration of the war until the camp's inmates were freed by the Allies.  Biography  Israël met Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in December 1939 after both were assigned to Reconnaissance Group 2/33 which was then flying from a farm field at La Hache Orconte in Champagne-Ardenne. Israël had been a civilian engineer before being called up to serve in the reserves at the start of the Second World War. He had earlier studied at the French Air Force schools in Ambérieu, and then Avord in 1936. When Saint-Exupéry joined the 2/33 Group in December 1939 he befriended several airmen including Francois Laux, Captain Moreau, Hochede Dutertre and Israël. The Jewish pilot had a \\"big very red and very Jewish nose\\", as Saint-Exupéry wrote in his work multiple times for reinforcement, in order to denounce the vitriolic antisemitism that the author despised.Schiff 1997, p. 366. During a daring mission on 22 May 1940, Israël's plane was shot down and he was soon captured by the Germans. The author's book, Pilote de guerre, was published in Paris in November 1942 by Editions Gallimard. The collaborationist press, which were allied with the Nazis, despised the book. They initially censored the book and finally it and Saint-Exupéry's other works were banned by the occupation authorities.Severson 2004, p. 171. When the book was first published, Jean Israël was in a prisoner of war camp in Lübeck, Silesia. This is where he learned of the storm of controversy aroused in France by the mention of his courage in Pilote de guerre, a copy of which was smuggled into the prison camp. In 1944, Israël began his fifth year of captivity in the prison camp when he learned of the death of Antoine de Saint- Exupéry. Israël later became a Colonel in the French Air Force, and also served as the chief pilot of Air Algérie. The director Robert Enrico created the TV movie Saint-Exupéry: The Last Mission in 1996, for French television (broadcast on France 3). The role of Jean Israël was played by the Arsene Jiroyan.  Pilote de guerre  His friend Saint-Exupéry described him as one of the heroes in Pilote de guerre (Flight to Arras), published in 1942, which made Israël one of France's most famous Jewish pilots. In Saint-Exupéry's award-winning book we find a passage: in 1939, war was declared and Saint- Exupéry joined the 2/33 Group along with his friends Laux, Gavoille, Israël and Hocheder, and two officers, Dutertre and Moreau. In their improvised airfield they shared a shack covered with corrugated iron. Saint-Exupéry's book, Flight to Arras used the name of his friend Jean Israël to denounce Nazi anti-Semitism. In the space of two pages of this book, the author mentioned the nose of his Jewish compatriot 14 times. Israël actually had quite an ordinary nose, according to one of Saint-Exupéry's biographers. The book met with antisemitic hostility among some French as Saint-Exupéry graphically described the heroic deeds of the Jewish member of his squadron.Severson 2004, p. 171. The book was available only illegally in France after it was banned by the collaborationist Vichy authorities to avoid embarrassment to their Nazi occupiers. Israël learned of the book when a copy of it bearing a false cover was smuggled into his prison, and appreciated the message from his friend Saint-Exupéry. At the beginning of Israël's fifth and final year in prison camp he learned on the evening of August 9, 1944 of the in-flight loss of Saint-Exupéry, which upset him greatly.Schiff 2006, p. 435.

It is a critically acclaimed work of 20th century Telugu literature and has been called \\"a novel of Tolstoyan scope\\". The novel has been translated into several other Indian languages. The \\"hoods\\" in the title refer to the hoods of the thousand-hooded serpent god who serves as the divine protector of the village where the story is set. Background This novel was written for a competition organised by Andhra University in 1934, in which this entry shared the prize with Adivi Bapiraju's Narayana Rao. Viswanatha dictated the novel extemporaneously to his younger brother, Venkateswarlu, who wrote it down. It was completed in 29 days, taking up 999 broadsheets. Many of the author's close associates say the book was influenced by his own life. Later, it was published in 1937-38 in Andhra Patrika as a serial, and again once more later. Again in 1987-88, it was republished in the golden jubilee edition of the same newspaper.  Characters  * Rameshwara Sastry, the hereditary chief minister of Subbannapeta * Krishnama Naidu, the zamindar of the village * Dharama Rao, the son of Rameswara Sastry * Ranga Rao, the westernized, England-educate son of Krishnama Naidu * Ganachari, the hereditary virgin-oracle of the Subrahmanyeswara, the deity of one of the local temples and a representation of Shiva, who is given the ability to glance into the future * Girika, a devadasi dancing maid in the service of Venugopala Swamy, the deity of one of the local temples and a representation of Vishnu * Rameswara Sastry, the son of Rameswara Sastry by his non-brahmin wife * Harappa Naidu, the only son of Ranga Rao Synopsis The story chronicles the lives of those living in a village named Subbannapeta over three centuries. The village's fortunes have a close relationship to the change in traditional social structures like the caste system, the temple, the family, and the farm. These aspects are symbolically represented by the families of Harappa Naidu, Rameswara Sastry, and Ganachari. At the start of the novel, Veeranna Naidu discovers a treasure trove and is convinced by a Brahmin astrologer to found Subbannapeta as a zamindari. He establishes temples for Subrahmanyeswara and Venugopala Swamy, representations of Shiva and Vishnu respectively, and constructs a fort, which offers safety and acts as a seat of traditional learning. The villagers' commitment to the two local temples decreases over the centuries and mirrors the gradual decline and disappearance of traditional culture and the village itself. The hoods of the thousand-hooded serpent that embodies the village's patron god Subrahmanyeswara disappear with this decline, with scarcely two remaining with the passage of time. Translations & Adaptations This novel was translated into Hindi by PV Narsimha Rao, former PM of India, as Sahasra Phan (\\"A Thousand Hoods\\") in 1968. In turn, it was translated from Hindi into Sanskrit with the same name by Prabhavati Devi, but only as a limited edition spiral book form. In 1995, it was aired on Doordarshan as a TV serial. The radio adaptation of Veyipadagalu as a serial play was broadcast by All India Radio, Hyderabad ‘A’ station with effect from 20 July 2013 every Saturday. The adaptation was scripted by Dr Dittakavi Syamala Devi who penned it in a record time of one month; the role of protagonist Dharma Rao was enacted by Uppaluri Subbaraya Sarma, and that of Arundhati (Dharma Rao’s wife) by Vasantha Lakshmi Ayyagari. In 1976, Chandrakant Mehta and Mahendra Dhave translated this novel into Gujarati. Later, R.V.S. Sundaram translated the work into Kannada. In 1998, it was published in a Kannada newspaper as \\"Nootana\\". The novel was translated into English by five translators over two and a half years. The five translators are Aruna Vyas, Atreya Sarma Uppaluri, Vaidehi Sasidhar, S. Narayana Swamy, and C. Subba Rao, who edited the volume.

History This is an interesting composition for Leighton, who usually veered towards Classical images and, in particular, favored nudes – the latter were so common in his work that many of his pictures had to be removed from the 1857 exhibition of English art that toured America, because they gave offense.C. Newall The Art of Lord Leighton, Phaidon Press (1993). The Italian man who sat for the newly married painter occurs often in Leighton's work: he was apparently one of the artist's favorite models. Importantly, his hands are painted in fine detail, emphasizing how crucial they are to his work. The soft tones and accuracy with which Leighton painted the couple contrasts obviously with the harshness of the orange tree behind them. Leighton appears to have had difficulty in painting it – on close inspection, the oranges look as though they have been enameled. Generally, the composition and glowing color of the picture reflect the influence of such 16th-century Venetian painters as Giorgione and Titian.Cf. MFA note on respective webpage . The Painter's Honeymoon was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1866 – it appears that Leighton deliberately prevented it from being shown publicly in the years following its completion.Cf. T. Barringer & E. Prettejohn, Frederic Leighton: Antiquity, Renaissance, Modernity, Yale University Press (1999). As Leighton was renowned for his lack of confidence and shyness, many of his contemporaries believed he felt he had betrayed too much of his own emotion to feel comfortable exhibiting the picture.

It aired on February 20, 2012. Plot Future Ted tells his children that the day that he told their mother he loved her was significant because he had not said those words to anyone since he confessed to Robin that he still loved her. In the aftermath of Ted's confession, he reminds Robin that five years ago their thoughts on the future were too different, and they broke up. He heads to bed but Robin surprises him by kissing him the next morning. Before they can talk about how Ted's confession could change their platonic relationship and status as roommates, Robin suddenly has to leave to work on a story in Moscow — she thought she had another twelve hours before she had to leave. After Ted hurriedly helps her pack, she kisses him again before leaving, promising to continue the conversation with him once she gets back. Meanwhile, a hungover Barney wakes up at Lily and Marshall's house after taking the \\"drunk train\\" and becomes convinced that they have a sex tape hidden somewhere in their house despite Lily's insistence that there is not one. While searching for it with the aid of some cleaning women, he finds a box of long-term bets they have been keeping, one of which involves Lily betting Marshall that Ted and Robin will not end up together. As Ted tells Marshall and Lily what happened between him and Robin, Barney arrives and calls Marshall and Lily out on their numerous long-term bets. When Barney learns that one of the bets confirms the existence of a sex tape, he returns to Marshall and Lily's house and eventually finds the tape. Ted learns of the bet regarding his relationship with Robin and becomes upset with Lily, who forces Ted to consider why he has not gotten back together with Robin in the past five years. After successfully finding the sex tape, Barney returns to Ted's apartment to use his VCR. When Ted considers that the reason why he and Robin never got back together was because she is in love with Barney, he is surprised with Barney's tepid reaction. Barney tells Ted everything that happened between him and Robin, saying, \\"Whatever I thought was there, she thought differently\\", and despite being told that Robin and Kevin broke up, he gives his blessing to Ted if he and Robin begin dating again. However, before they can watch the sex tape, Marshall and Lily arrive to try to win the bet involving the sex tape—Lily wins if Barney watches it, while Marshall wins if Barney does not. After scaring Barney with possible images that he will not want to see, Marshall wins the bet when Barney destroys Ted's VCR. When Robin returns from Russia, she and Ted have the chance to re-examine their relationship. Ted picks her up at the airport and takes her to dinner at the Brooklyn bistro where they had their first date. Then at home, he realizes that they are not going to work out and turns down Robin's consolation that they still have an agreement to get married if they are both single at age 40. When Ted asks if Robin loves him, Robin admits that she does not and feels comfortable with them as friends. Ted asks her to forget that the past week ever happened. When Marshall learns that Ted is giving up on the idea of being with Robin in any romantic context, he tells Robin that she should move out for Ted's sake, which she agrees to do, leaving Ted forlorn and alone on the roof of his apartment building. Some time later, as future Ted tells his children that getting closure on his relationship with Robin finally opened the possibility of meeting their mother, Ted walks out of MacLaren's Bar as all the people on the street walk by with yellow umbrellas. At their house, Lily, convinced that this is the definite end of Ted and Robin, asks Marshall to pay up on their bet. Echoing his words at Ted's wedding to Stella, Marshall refuses, smiles and then says \\"Not yet\\". Cameo appearance by Conan O'Brien Talk show host Conan O'Brien makes a very brief cameo appearance in the episode as a non- speaking patron at MacLaren's; he can be seen in the first part of the episode, watching on as Barney races out of the bar. O'Brien won the role via a 2011 charity auction. According to show co-creator Carter Bays, when the show's writers and producers first learned that O'Brien won the auction, they started to brainstorm ideas about what he could play. O'Brien, however, replied back that he just wanted to be an extra who would blend in. \\"We realized this was really the funniest version [of a cameo]\\", said Bays. \\"In New York, every now and then you'll see somebody famous at a bar, but nobody really makes a big deal out of it.\\" Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A−. After being particularly critical of the previous episode, Television Without Pity's Ethan Alter gave \\"No Pressure\\" a B, stating that the Ted and Robin storyline was \\"mercifully brief\\" but criticised Lily and Marshall for breaking character.

Biography Chikamune was the eldest son of Date Narimura. His childhood name was Masachiyo (政千代). His mother, Nobuko, was the daughter of the kampaku Takatsukasa Sukehira, thus making Chikamune the second cousin of Emperor Kōkaku. His mother died shortly after his birth due to complications with the pregnancy, and both his grandfather and father followed during the same year, leaving the infant Chikamune as daimyō of Sendai. Normally, this would be cause for the Tokugawa shogunate to appoint a metsuke to oversee the domain until his majority, or could even be a cause of attainder, so the domain's officials kept the fact of Date Narimura's death a secret for several months until the succession was confirmed. In the same year, the infant Chikamune was wed to Aya-hime, a daughter of Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari. During this period, his grandmother, Kanshin-in, wielded great influence. In 1797, Sendai was beset by the largest peasant revolt in its history. The causes were various, and included opposition to reforms initiated during the rule of Date Narimura, and the rebels included 61 upper-rank samurai and more than 2000 lower-rank samurai. Aya-hime also died during the same year. In 1805, Kanshin-in died, and her influence was replaced by that of Chikamune's great-grandmother. In 1806, Chikamune was wed to Aya-hime's younger sister, Asa-hime, thus re- securing the connection between the Date clan and the Tokugawa, and in 1807, the retired rōjū Matsudaira Sadanobu spent four months in Sendai to oversee affairs. In 1808, the shogunate assigned Sendai Domain to secure the northern frontier of Japan at Hakodate, Iturup and Kunashir against increasing incursions by Russia. The domain dispatched 1700 troops to these areas. In 1809, Chikamune contracted smallpox, Although he survived the disease, he was left disfigured to the extent that his appearance at any official function was deemed inappropriate. His younger half-brother, Tokusaburō (Date Narimune) was adopted as his heir in 1812. Chikamune died two months later at the age of 17. His grave is at the Zuihoden in Sendai. His wife later remarried to Matsudaira Naritsugu, daimyō of Fukui Domain. Family * Father: Date Narimura * Mother: Takatsukasa Nobuko (1775–1796) * Wives: ** Aya-hime (1795–1797), daughter of Tokugawa Ienari ** Asa-hime (1803–1843), daughter of Tokugawa Ienari Controversy over death Chikamune was not seen in public after he contracted smallpox on 4 January 1806 and died of unknown causes two months after the appointment of Date Narimune as his successor. This has led many historians to postulate that Chikamune may have actually died in 1806, and that his death was kept a secret from the authorities. Sendai Domain had been in danger of attainder ever since the death of Date Narimura, and this had been avoided largely through a marriage tie with Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari. The death of Chikamune without heir would have voided this arrangement. References *Papinot, Edmond. (1948). Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan. New York: Overbeck Co.

Another daughter Elizabeth Ball (1750–1797) married William Hayley (1745–1820) the poet, whose great uncle was William Haley the Dean of Chichester Cathedral from 1699–1715. Education Ball matriculated in 1715 at age 18. He then went on to study at Brasenose College, Oxford where he was awarded his B.A. degree in 1719. He received his M.A. from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1726. Career Ball was ordained in 1723 and became vicar of Boxgrove, a village near Chichester, the same year.

In 1736 he was appointed archdeacon of Chichester. Ball failed to secure the deanery of Worcester so when nominated to be dean of Chichester (again) in 1754 he accepted it. He also continued in his post as archdeacon of Chichester. The career of Thomas Ball reveals a close linking of the political and ecclesiastical life of Sussex in the middle of the 18th century. Dean Ball and his chapter were major supporters of the Whig Party in the county and for the Duke of Newcastle and his family. The key role of Ball was indicated in a letter from Newcastle to the Duke of Richmond in 1740, where he said \\"I reckon he [Ball] is the best agent we have in our parts, and will do whatever you have Him..\\".

Attributed to Andrew of Wyntoun, a learned scholar of the time, it is one of the only manuscripts composed in Scots verse before the seventeenth century, though it is also said to be written in northern English. Wyntoun himself calls his language \\"Ynglys\\". The Cronykil survives in eleven manuscripts,David, Laing, ed., Oryginale Cronykil, vol.1 (1872) full text at The Internet Archive. such as those in the Cotton library, the Harleian library, and the library of the faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh. The purest is the Royal MS, Brit. Museum. There is speculation over the date of the Royal manuscript, but scholars have determined that it likely could not have been written prior to 1420. (Wyntoun was born around 1350.) Andrew of Wyntoun and John of Fordun were contemporary historians, and though they did not know of each other, they share a claim to the title of original historian of Scotland.. Wyntoun wrote in eight syllable verse and couplets to form a primitive poetry. Composed of 30,000 verses, the Cronykil is divided into nine books, and each book is divided into chapters. The first five books focus on the creation of the world in general, and Scottish history commences in the sixth. The eighth book is longer than the first four combined. Wyntoun received the last eighty-three years of the history, covering King David II to Robert II, from an acquaintance. Among other topics, Wytoun records the churches and Bishops of St. Andrew, as well as information about the royal families of Scotland, lines from Barbour and an elegiac cantus for Alexander III. However, he skims over Alexander the Great and the wars of the Anglo- Saxons with the Ancient Britons, merely directing readers to find such histories in other books. Most notably, the Cronykil contains the original story of Macbeth and the witches (in Book Six). Wyntoun provided a second, revised Cronykil, correcting minor mistakes made in the first edition.

Biography Narimune was the posthumous second son of Date Narimura; his mother was a concubine and he was born at the clan's Sodegasaki residence in Edo. His childhood name was Norisaburō (徳三郎) later Shōjirō (総次郎). In 1804, he was moved to the clan’s primary residence in Edo, and he came down with chickenpox the same year, but recovered. In 1809, his elder half-brother, Date Chikamune was highly disfigured by smallpox, and went into seclusion until his death in 1812. During this period, Narimune appeared in all official functions in his place. He was adopted as Chikamune’s heir in 1812, and changed his name to Date Munezumi. Later that same year, after Chikamune died, he was received in formal audience by Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari, who presided over his genpuku ceremony, and who granted him a kanji from his name. He also received the Court rank of Junior Fourth, Lower Grade and courtesy titles of Mutsu-no-kami and Sakonoe-shōshō as had been held by his father. In 1814, he was wed to the daughter of Tokugawa Harutomi, daimyō of Kii Domain. He fell ill in June 1819 and died a month later at the age of 22. As he had no male heir, the son of Tamura Murasuke, daimyō of Ichinoseki Domain was posthumously adopted as his heir.

Biography Nariyoshi was the grandson of Date Yoshimura, the 5th daimyō of Sendai and he was the 4th son of Tamura Murasuke, the daimyō of Ichinoseki Domain. He was born in Edo, and his childhood name was Kichigorō (吉五郎). Shortly after his birth, his father retired, and turned the domain over to Tamura Muneaki. In 1812, he underwent his genpuku ceremony and took the name of Tamura Akiyoshi. Tamura Muneaki declined to adopt him as heir as expected, and although the young Akiyoshi was sent to Ichinoseki, he was not given any official title or duties. A turning point came in 1819, when he was called to Aoba Castle. The sudden death of Date Narimune without an heir placed Sendai Domain in a very precarious position vis-a-vis the Tokugawa shogunate. Date Narimune, and his predecessor, Date Chikamune, had both died without heirs and the shogunate had taken extraordinary measures to ensure the continuation of the Date line; however, a third instance in such a short period of time placed the domain in danger of attainder. Akiyoshi was betrothed to Narimune's three-year-old daughter, Shiba-hime, and took the name of Date Muneyoshi. He was proclaimed 11th Date daimyō of Sendai, and was received in formal audience by Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari three months later. During this audience, he was granted a kanji from Ienari's name to become Date Nariyoshi. He was granted the Court rank of Junior Fourth, Lower Grade and courtesy title of Mutsu-no-kami. In 1826, he formally wed Shiba-hime, but died less than two years later in Edo. His death reopened the succession issue within Sendai Domain, as his son and heir was still a child.

Taking into consideration ornamentation, cutting and materials, it can be observed that it is a replica of historical costumes of the Renaissance.Barbara Bazielich. Śląskie Stroje Ludowe. Katowice: Wydawnictwo Śląsk, 1988, p. 34 The male folk costume was worn only to the late 19th century, whereas the female folk costume was more popular and spread in the vicinity of the Wisła, Istebna and Koniaków. Previously in this area the costumes of Silesian Gorals prevailed. Female folk costumes in Cieszyn were subjected to many changes, especially in respect to ornamentations and better quality of materials. Due to its richness and elegance the costume quickly became a target of artists and specialists in folk culture.  Cieszyn folk costumes at the beginning of the 20th century  A significant change concerning sets of garments, cutting and materials can be observed in the second half of the 19th century. Moreover, the process of modernization intensified after the first World War. Since that time Cieszyn folk costumes have never come to their traditional form again. Men constituted the social group which was most prone to change and they first ceased to wear traditional costumes. It may be due to the fact that majority of men migrated to industrial cities for economic reasons. A clash of different cultures resulted in greater standardization. Tastes have changed and new materials were introduced to modify traditional cuttings. Kabotek is the conspicuous example of this process. The cutting of this short waist shift was simplified. What is more, handmade ornaments were replaced by machine embroidery and laces. Leather and silver elements in Cieszynian belt were frequently replaced by rubber and beads.Barbara Bazielich. Śląskie Stroje Ludowe. Katowice: Wydawnictwo Śląsk, 1988, p. 37 Woman in Cieszynian folk costume 1917 Female folk costume The female folk costume featured the lush and elegance, due to its essential element, silver jewellery. In the 18th and 19th century, women in Cieszyn wore splendorous clothes which consisted of a lace cap, covered with headgear, a short shirt (kabotek), redbreas, padded corset (żywotek), sewn at the waist, apron, white stockings and black shoes. It was not until a century later that the jewellery previously worn by the nobility and the bourgeoisie was adapted as the traditional costume by the population of small towns and villages. = Elements of the female folk costume = * Kabotek- a short waist shift with puffed, elbowlength sleeves. Wedding version of the shirt has long sleeves. Trimming of a thin collar, named lemiec, was embroidered a half cross stitch in black or brown. Later, satin stitch embroidery was introduced. Gradually, in the 20th century a half cross stitch was entirely supplanted by white satin stitch embroidery and broderie anglaise.Barbara Bazielich. Śląskie Stroje Ludowe . Katowice: Wydawnictwo Śląsk, 1988, p. 84 Floral patterns became dominant. * Żywotek- embroidered with silver or golden thread, stiffen kind of a corset with braces. The front part of żywotek, przedniczki, is widely cut in the shape of a rectangle. The back part of , , forms a characteristic triangle, called . The item of clothing is velvet and usually black or claret. Most frequently a golden thread is used for red velvet while silver thread is used for black velvet embroidery. However, it is not a strict rule.Elżbieta Piskorz- Branekova. Polskie Hafty i Koronki. Warszawa: Wydawnictwo MUZA SA, 2009, p. 249 The cutting of żywotek has undergone many changes. The most remarkable one is an extension of the embroidered surface. Also decorative patterns were modified. Three bouquets, two flowers, and garlands became the most common ones.Barbara Bazielich. Śląskie Stroje Ludowe . Katowice: Wydawnictwo Śląsk, 1988, p. 84 For embroidery metal threads were used, however, poorer women used silk threads. With time, silk floss gained popularity.Elżbieta Piskorz- Branekova. Polskie Hafty i Koronki. Warszawa: Wydawnictwo MUZA SA, 2009, p. 250 Żywotek is decorated also with sequins, pearls and bead, so that they form a colourful mosaic. The item of clothing is stiffen with cardboard and lined lining. * Dress- a dark colour wollen skirt, a sewed corset, and żywotek. Skirts were sewn with 6-8 meters of fabric panels and were 5-6 m wide. * Zapaska- long, tied at the waist apron. * Apron – more often linen than damask, consisted of two: front and back aprons, which replaced skirt. * Slip * Bonnet cap, named czepiec- consisting of a reticulated top and very decorative crocheted cap, named czółko. At first, czółko was to adhere as closely as possible to the head, later it became wider. Czółka were embroidered in small motifs, stars or dots. Czepiec is tied at the back and covered with usually linen cloth (chusta czepinowa). Currently, more common are silk cherry-gold or dark brown silk clothes, with a floral motif. Czepiec, was handmade, and his appearance differed depending on age and wealth of the owner. * Loincloth- a patterned gibbon, tied in a bow at the waist. Its scarves often reached the end of the dress. =Jewellery= Similarly to Cieszynian folk costume, jewellery is a replica of ornaments from times of the Renaissance and the Reformation. Because of its being a trade rout and having fertile soil, Cieszyn was rather a rich city. Fashion was being modified in accordance to European markets thanks to trips of the last descendants of the Piast dynasty in Cieszyn on the turn of the 16th and 17th century. Cieszyn was the biggest centre of jewellery trade in the region. Ornaments were made of silver, gold, and some alloys. Metalwork techniques were filigree and casting. Male costumes were decorated only with metal buttons ().Elżbieta Piskorz- Branekova. Biżuteria Ludowa w Polsce.

Warszawa: Wydawnictwo MUZA SA, 2009, pp. 172-173 * Collar stud- used to fasten a collar of kabotek. The studs were of round or heart shape. * Orpant- a piece of jewellery consisting of four chains which fall into semicircle. They were attached to braces of żywotek. * Hoczki- metal items with small holes, which enable żywotek to be laced up. The wealthier woman, the more hoczki she had installed in her żywotek * Belt- usually silver, most valuable item of jewellery. Its production required the greatest precision. Originally the belts consisted of small, profusely decorated silver plates, which were joined by a chain. In latter versions the technique of filigree was used.  References   Bibliography  * B.

Biography Narikuni was the son of Date Munemitsu of the Tome-Date clan, a subsidiary branch of the main Date clan, and was the grandson of Date Yoshimura, the 5th daimyō of Sendai. His childhood name was Kōgorō (幸五郎) later Tosaburō (藤三郎) and become Sojirō (総次郎). In 1828, with the death of Date Nariyoshi, Sendai Domain faced a major crisis. His son, the future Date Yoshikuni was only two-years-old. The Tokugawa shogunate had taken extraordinary measures to ensure the continuation of the Date line in the case of his predecessors Date Chikamune and Date Narimune; however, the patience of Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari had worn thin over Sendai Domain succession problems, and the domain faced the possibility of attainder. The rōjū, Mizuno Tadaakira, initially proposed a solution whereby Nariyoshi’s 4-year-old daughter, Masahime would be married to a son of Tokugawa Ienari; however, negotiations did not proceed and instead she married Date Narikuni, from one of cadet houses of the Date clan. Date Narikuni would then adopt the infant Date Yoshikuni as his heir. Events went as planned and in 1828 Narikuni received Court rank of Junior Fourth, Lower Grade and the courtesy title of Mutsu-no- kami. His ranks were raised to Junior Fourth, Upper Grade and Sakonoe-chūshō in 1831. Narikuni was noted for his scholarly disposition and knowledge of literature. However, during the sankin-kōtai to Edo in 1840 he fell ill, and died in Edo the following year at the age of 25.
