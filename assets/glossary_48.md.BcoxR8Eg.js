Its full name is kai men baji quan (), which means \\"open-gate eight-extremities fist\\".  Origins  Baji quan was originally called bazi quan ( or ) or \\"rake fist\\" because the fists, held loosely and slightly open, are used to strike downwards in a rake- like fashion. The name was considered to be rather crude in its native tongue, so it was changed to baji quan. The term baji comes from the Chinese classic, the Yijing (I-Ching), and signifies an “extension of all directions”. In this case, it means “including everything” or “the universe”. The first recorded baji quan teacher was Wu Zhong () (1712–1802). Other notable teachers included Wu Xiufeng () and Li Shuwen () (1864–1934). The latter was from Cangzhou (), Hebei, and acquired the nickname \\"God of Spear Li\\". A Beijing opera Wu Shen (martial male character) by training, he was also an expert fighter. His most famous quote is, \\"I do not know what it's like to hit a man twice.\\" Li Shuwen's students included Huo Dian Ge () (bodyguard to Pu Yi, the last Emperor of China), Li Chenwu (bodyguard to Mao Zedong), and Liu Yunqiao () (secret agent for the nationalist Kuomintang and instructor of the Chiang Kai- shek's bodyguards). Baji quan has since acquired a reputation as the \\"bodyguard style\\". Ma Feng Tu () and Ma Yin Tu () introduced baji into the Central Guoshu Institute (Nanjing Guoshu Guan ) where it is required for all students.Ba Zi Jie Xi: a talk on rake fist 耙子解析 Baji quan shares roots with another Hebei martial art, Piguazhang. It is said that Wu Zhong, the oldest traceable master in the baji lineage, taught both arts together as an integrated fighting system. They eventually split apart, only to be recombined by Li Shuwen in the late 18th to early 19th century. As a testament to the complementary nature of these two styles, a proverb states: \\"When pigua is added to baji, gods and demons will all be terrified. When baji is added to pigua, heroes will sigh knowing they are no match against it.\\" ()Su Yuchang, Pachi Tanglang Chuan: Eight Ultimate Praying Mantis, 2014, p. 175ff.  Branches and lineages  Prominent branches and lineages of the art survived to modern times, including Han family Baji, Huo family, Ji family, Li family, Ma family, Qiang family, Wu family (from Wu Xiefeng), Wutan Baji Quan and Yin Yang Baji Quan. Each has a unique element while sharing core practices. Some lineages are more common or only exist in Mainland China, while others have spread to Western countries. = Wutan Baji = Wutan BajiNamed after the Wutan Center for the Promotion of Chinese Wushu (武壇國術推廣中心), not to be confused with the Wudang 武當 of the Wudang Mountains. is the most common lineage in the West today. Originally from Taiwan, where its founder, Liu Yunqiao, lived. This lineage includes additional arts that are taught alongside Baji, such as Piguaquan and Baguazhang. Jian Diansheng >> Li Shuwen >> Liu Yunqiao >> Adam Hsu, Su Yuchang, and Tony Yang >> Many students in Taiwan and abroad (taught by one or more of them).Su Yuchang, Pachi Tanglang Chuan: Eight Ultimate Praying Mantis, 2014, pp. 11, 37, 42. = Nanjing Baji = Baji of Nanjing was introduced to the Guoshu Institute by students of Zhang Jingxing, Han Huiqing, and Ma Yingtu. Han had a great influence on the spread of Baji in southern China, to the point that there was a saying ‘bei li nan han’ meaning ‘Li [Shuwen] in the north and Han [Huachen] in the south’. = Mengcun Baji = Meng Village (Mengcun) is said to be the original birthplace of Baji Quan, or at least the modern versions of the art. Baji is still widely practiced there. = Wu Xiufeng = Wu Xiufeng (1908–1976) is the \\"grandfather\\" of many modern Baji lineages. The following lineages came down from him.

Features  = Tactics and strategy = Baji quan opens the opponent's arms forcibly (qiang kai men ) and mount attacks at high, mid, and low levels of the body (san pan lian ji ). It is most useful in close combat, as it focuses on elbow, knee, shoulder and hip strikes. When blocking an attack or nearing an opponent, baji quan techniques emphasize striking major points of vulnerability, namely the thorax (trunk of the body), legs and neck. Zhou Jingxuan of Tianjin, holding a typical Baji Quan posture. The sideways- protruding elbow is often used for striking in this art. The \\"six big ways of opening\\" (liu da kai ) are: * Ding : using the fist, elbow or shoulder to push forward and upward. * Bao : putting arms together as if hugging someone. It is usually followed by Pi (splitting). * Ti : elevating the knee to hit the thigh of the opponent, or elevating the foot to hit the shin of the opponent, etc. * Dan : using a single move. * Kua : using the hip. * Chan : entanglement with rotation around the wrist, elbow and shoulder. = Stepping and body methods = Footwork in baji quan has three special features: * Zhen Jiao * Nian Bu * Chuang BuSu Yuchang, Pachi Tanglang Chuan: Eight Ultimate Praying Mantis, 2014, p. 131ff. These striking techniques are related to traditional Chinese medicine, which states that all parts of the body are connected, either physically or spiritually. = Forms = The forms of baji are divided into armed and unarmed routines. There are twenty fist forms, which include twelve Baji Small Structure Fists, Baji Black Tiger Fist, Baji Dan Zhai, Baji Dan Da/Dui Da, Baji Luohan Gong, and Baji Si Lang Kuan. There are eight weapons forms, including Liu He Da Qiang (spear), Chun Yang Jian (sword), San Yin Dao (sabre), Xing Zhe Bang (staff), Pudao, and Chun Qiu Da Dao (a long two-handed heavy blade, used by Generals sitting on their horses). Most schools focus on a much smaller curriculum. Standard across almost all groups are Xiaobaji and Dabaji; two weapons forms, the sabre and the spear; a two-man training routine called Baji Duijie or Baji Duida and a series of 8 short attacking methods called the \\"Ba Shi\\" (Eight Postures), which are derived from the art of Shaolin Jingang Bashi. = Power generation and expression = The major features of baji include elbow strikes, arm/fist punches, hip checks and strikes with the shoulder. All techniques are executed with a short power, developed through training; among Chinese martial artists, baji is known for its fast movements. Baji focuses on infighting, entering from a longer range with a distinctive charging step (zhen jiao). The essence of baji quan lies in jin, or power-issuing methods, particularly fa jin (explosive power). The style contains six types of jin, eight different ways to hit and several principles of power usage. Most of baji quan's moves utilize a one-hit push- strike method from very close range. The bulk of the damage is dealt through the momentary acceleration that travels up from the waist to the limb and further magnified by the charging step known as zhen jiao. The mechanics of jin are developed through many years of practice and baji quan is known for its strenuous lower-body training and its emphasis on the horse stance. Its horse stance is higher than that of typical Long Fist styles. Like other styles, there is also \\"the arrow-bow stance\\", \\"the one-leg stance\\", \\"the empty stance\\" (), \\"the drop stance\\" (), etc. There are eight different hand poses, in addition to different types of breathing and zhen jiao.  Influences  Baji focuses on being more direct, culminating in powerful, fast strikes that will render an opponent unable to continue. Even so, there are some styles that are derived from Baji's main principles or concepts on how to hit the opponent: * Eight postures (Ba shi) * Eight movements method (Ba shi gong) * Eight movements method (Ba shi chui) * Double Eight Postures (Shuang ba shi) * Eight postures of the dragon style (Longxing ba shi) Many of these forms are also based or mixed with Luohan fist, a Shaolin style. The term ba shi may also refer to baji. The term is also used in xingyi quan.

She is best known for winning the reality television series Tough Enough in 2001 and for her subsequent appearances with the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment. She was with the company until 2004. Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment= Tough Enough (2001) Guenard won a year's contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after she co-won the first season of Tough Enough, a show meant both to be a \\"WWF Superstar\\" talent search, and a semi-documentary of the difficulties of being a trainee professional wrestler. Ohio Valley Wrestling (2001–2002) Guenard made a few appearances on WWF episodes in 2001 before being sent to the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) promotion, with whom WWE had a talent-development agreement. While in OVW she feuded with Victoria. SmackDown! (2002–2004) Guenard debuted on the SmackDown! brand on the June 6, 2002 episode, in a backstage segment with The Hurricane (who was her on-screen ex-boyfriend) and Jamie Noble. Noble and Guenard then became an on-screen couple undergoing a \\"trailer trash\\" gimmick. They were both playing as heels, with Nidia leading Noble to several wins, due to interference during the matches. At the King of the Ring she led Noble to winning the Cruiserweight Championship from The Hurricane. She then began to feud with SmackDown! Diva Torrie Wilson leading to many solo and mixed tag team matches with Guenard and Noble against Wilson and various other cruiserweights, including Funaki, Billy Kidman, Rey Mysterio, and Brian Kendrick. On the October 16, 2003 episode of SmackDown! Guenard was blinded by Tajiri during a match between Tajiri and Noble, after which Tajiri spewed his \\"Black mist\\" onto her face (this version of the mist was only ever seen in this instance). Storyline-wise, this encounter resulted in a physical 'injury' to Guenard. After recovering, Guenard started appearing at ringside with sunglasses on, to 'sell' the after effects of her injuries. During this time, Noble would throw Guenard in front of various opponents at a match's climax, to both save himself and let him later accuse them of \\"hitting a woman\\", etc. Later in this storyline, Rey Mysterio revealed to Guenard that Noble was exploiting her in the aforementioned manner, resulting in Guenard turning against Noble and becoming a fan favorite in the process. The two feuded, culminating in a match at No Way Out in which Noble had to wear a blindfold. True to character, Noble cheated to win as he removed his blindfold during the match. Raw (2004) Guenard was drafted to the Raw Brand on March 22, 2004. She became a face and claimed to be excited that she was drafted to Raw, where she can compete for the WWE Women's Championship. She made her debut match on the March 29, 2004 episode of Raw, defeating Molly Holly. She then tag teamed regularly with Stacy Keibler and Victoria against heels Trish Stratus, Gail Kim, Molly Holly and Jazz. With the shift to Raw also came a change in character, as Guenard's Hispanic heritage was played up; to this effect, she was no longer billed as being from the South but instead she was billed as being from Puerto Rico and she no longer spoke English during promos, instead speaking Spanish in a quick and angry fashion. Guenard was released from her WWE contract on November 3, 2004 along with several other performers, in a routine purge of talent. = Independent circuit = Guenard worked several wrestling matches post-WWE, including versus Gail Kim for Mexico's Toryumon and for Australia's World Series Wrestling. In addition, she worked for TNA overseas \\"a few times.\\" In a ClubWWI.com interview, she said they were fun to work for, but she liked her freedom from wrestling, in general. She also wrestled for Northeast Wrestling (NWE), where she feuded with Jackie Gayda.http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/n/nidia/ Personal life Guenard and her husband David Krichmar have a daughter Lilith (born 2007) and a son, Roman (born 2013).

In 1940, Jean Hersholt, then-president of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, found of walnut and orange groves in the southwest end of the San Fernando Valley which were selling for US$850 an acre ($0.21/m2) ($40,800). The fund's board purchased the parcel that same year to build the Motion Picture Country House. To offset the costs for the first buildings, which were designed by architect William Pereira, were sold. Mary Pickford and Jean Hersholt broke the first ground. The dedication was on September 27, 1942. The Motion Picture Hospital was dedicated on the grounds of the Country House in 1948. In attendance were Buddy Rogers and Loretta Young, among other stars.https://www.mptf.com/mptf- story-1/ Services were later extended to those working in the television industry as well, and the name was altered to reflect the change. Operations Scores of movie notables spent their last years here, as have far less famous people from behind the scenes of the industry. Those with money paid their own way, while those who had no money paid nothing. Fees are based solely on the \\"ability to pay.\\" Individuals in movies, TV, and other aspects of the industry, are accepted, such as actors, artists, backlot men, cameramen, directors, extras, producers, and security guards. To qualify for a cottage, applicants (or their spouses) must have reached a minimum age of seventy, and must have worked steadily for at least twenty years in entertainment industry production. The waiting time is usually a few months, with no preference given to celebrities or those who can pay their own way, officials of the fund have said. The facility has an annual budget of $120 million. In 1993, the Motion Picture & Television Fund Foundation was established with Jeffrey Katzenberg as Founding Chairman. The Foundation continues to exist as the conduit to marshal the vision of its donors and their philanthropy to the growing human needs of the entertainment community it serves. The MPTF Foundation puts on annual events that help raise millions of dollars, to continue its mission to assist those entertainment industry members in need. These events include the Michael Douglas and Friends Golf Tournament, The Night Before and The Evening Before. In 1998, the Woodland Hills campus was renamed The Wasserman Campus of the Motion Picture & Television Fund in honor of the long-time commitment and support of Mr. and Mrs. Lew Wasserman. In February 2000, William Haug resigned as MPTF CEO. The position was filled on May 16, 2000, by Dr. David Tillman, LA Times who was at that time one of the highest paid CEOs of a health care center. His current annual salary, including perks and bonuses, is approximately $750,000. In 2006, the groundbreaking for the Saban Center for Health and Wellness featuring the Jodie Foster Aquatic Pavilion was held on The Wasserman Campus. The center was named after donors Haim Saban and his wife Dr. Cheryl Saban. It opened its doors on July 18, 2007, and features aquatic and land-based therapies as well as MPTF's Center on Aging. Besides offering temporary financial assistance and operating the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, MPTF's services operate six outpatient health centers throughout the greater Los Angeles area as well as the Samuel Goldwyn Foundation Children's Center. In October 2008, MPTF's Corporate Board of Directors voted unanimously to close its acute-care hospital and long-term care facility by October 2009. In December 2008 the MPTF Board of Trustees voted unanimously to support the October decision of the Corporate Board. This vote was done without the knowledge of residents or families that would have been affected by the closure. As late as November 2008, after the October 2008 vote to close the acute-care hospital and long-term care facility, residents were admitted to the Long Term Care center under the impression that they would be there 'for the rest of their lives', only to learn a few months later that the LTC unit would be closing. In 2002, director Barry Avrich produced and directed a documentary about the MPTF called Glitter Palace. The film featured an inside look at MPTF and its famous residents. Announced closure of LTCU On January 14, 2009, residents and families of the long-term care unit (LTCU) were notified by mail of the closure and imminent re-location of elderly and disabled residents under the care of the MPTF. In a meeting held by former CEO Dr. David Tillman with concerned family members, it was revealed that the LTCU and Acute Care Center would be closing. The meeting became extremely contentious as it became known that the reasons for closure had been simmering for five years without the knowledge of residents who had been admitted to the facility under the false promise of having a 'home for the rest of their lives'. The main reason given to the families was that the LTCU was losing $10 million per year, and that this would ultimately bankrupt the fund. It was noted by actors John Schneider and David Carradine, who attended the meeting in support of the families, that the MPTF was indeed not living up to their credo of \\"taking care of their own\\" and had failed to notify the families and the entertainment industry of the closures in a proper, humane way. Foundation CEO Scherer had been profiled in 1996 as a rainmaker whose fundraising acumen was allowing the Motion Picture Home to dramatically expand its services. At the time of the announcement, 138 individuals were receiving long-term care at the facility. Jeffrey Katzenberg, current chairman of the MPTF Foundation Board, said the fund realized they had no choice but to close the facility, stating \\"the acute-care hospital and long-term-care facility are generating operating deficits that could bankrupt MPTF in a very few years.\\" There were over 500 hospital admissions and approximately 100 long-term residents alone in 2008. The fund administrators projected their shortfall would only grow as a result of the deteriorating economy.By Lisa Girion and Richard Verrier: Primary sources of funding for long-term care and the hospital are Medicare and Medi-Cal. The facility claims it receives approximately $20 million a year in reimbursements, though operating costs were $30 million a year. The MPTF receives approximately $10,500 per patient per month from Medi-Cal. The California Healthcare Foundation found that the MPTF receives 80% of its patient funding from Medi-Cal. Soon thereafter, a grass-roots organization Saving the Lives of Our Own (STLOOO) was created to organize residents, family members, and supporters to fight the closure of the LTCU. A Facebook group was generated that quickly became over 3,500-strong, to also support those residents and families who were facing eviction by the MPTF. Soon thereafter, the law firm of Girardi + Keese came aboard to represent residents and family members who were guardians ad litem for their elderly family members. In the ensuing months, the MPTF had to deal with a barrage of claims that revealed inaccuracies in claims of the fund's alleged financial peril, and the absence of any exposure of the elderly residents to transfer trauma. According to a STLOOO member, the daughter-in-law of one resident reached out to him over the Internet stating that her mother had refused to eat on the second day in her new residence. Two weeks later the woman had died following complications due to pneumonia. Claims of bullying by social service workers and more deaths that could be attributed to transfer trauma were reported to family members by other family members. Additionally, in an act that could allege intentional infliction of emotional distress, the MPTF placed a fake studio prop cop car that was painted to resemble a Los Angeles Police Department cruiser in the parking lot. That had an intimidating effect on the elderly residents who knew they were facing 'eviction' from the property. Again, Ken Scherer in an interview was quoted as saying the idea of the prop police car was 'wrong', his admission surprising families. Articles published in the Los Angeles Times, the Daily News and online by The Wrap.com and Nikki Finke's Hollywood Daily continually hammered the Motion Picture and Television Fund with new-found facts, reporting of resident deaths, and other facts that flew in the face of what the MPTF was claiming. In October 2009, when it was originally set to close down the LTCU, the MPTF renewed their operating license of the LTCU and Acute Care Unit for another year. CEO David Tillman later resigned and was replaced by ousted Panavision CEO Bob Beitcher. Future Through the tenacity of its advocates, the MPTF was navigated through the storm of its 2009 fiscal crisis. As of 2016 the MPTCHH is still fully operational and has plans of expansion, including a for-profit 400-unit luxury community for independent-living seniors on an 18-acre adjacent field (now growing tomatoes and basil) that would pump money back into the organization. For his 99th birthday, actor Kirk Douglas endowed the MPTF with a $15 million gift to enable the creation of an 80-resident Alzheimer facility. The facility, which is to be named the Kirk Douglas Care Pavilion, has not yet been officially announced. 2020 coronavirus outbreak The hospital experienced an outbreak amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020,First MPTF Nursing Home Retiree Tests Positive For Coronavirus; Two Others Showing Symptoms resulting in the deaths of at least five residents.

Health Net's behavioral health services subsidiary, MHN, provides behavioral health, substance abuse and employee assistance programs (EAPs) to approximately 7.3 million individuals in various states, including the company's own health plan members. The company's subsidiaries also offer managed health care products related to prescription drugs, and offer managed health care product coordination for multi-region employers and administrative services for medical groups and self-funded benefits programs. HMO, POS, insured PPO, and government contracts subsidiaries provide health benefits to approximately 5.9 million individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through group, individual, Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, and Veterans Affairs programs. In July 2015, Centene announced its intention to acquire Health Net for $6.8 billion. St. Louis-based Centene completed its acquisition of Health Net in March 2016. Health Net's dual headquarters are located in St. Louis, Missouri and Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California.  History  Health Net of California was first established as a non-profit corporation in 1977. A 1992 state of California order permitted the health care company to convert itself from a nonprofit into a for-profit company. At the same time, the state order required the new company to transfer 80% of its equity to the California Wellness Foundation, a successor charity to its non-profit status. Under the terms of the California Department of Corporations' conversion order approving Health Net's for-profit status, the California Wellness Foundation received $300 million plus 80 percent of the equity of Health Net's parent holding company. In August 1993, Health Net merged with Qualmed to form Health Systems International. The merger created a 1.8-million-member HMO with a market value of $725 million, one of the biggest publicly traded health care companies at the time. Dr. Malik Hasan had founded Qual-Med, with his wife Seeme Hasan in southern Colorado. Qual-Med first went public in June 1991. In May 1997, Health Systems International merged with Foundation Health Corporation to form Foundation Health Systems. At the time of the merger the newly created Foundation Health was valued at $1.27 billion and was the 4th largest health insurer in the U.S. and the second largest HMO in California. It had more than 5 million members in 17 states and in 2.8 California. In November 2000 Foundation Health Systems officially changed its name to Health Net, Inc. when the company started trading on the New York Stock under the symbol HNT. State-specific divisions existed under a variety of names prior to the 2000 renaming of Health Net, Inc.: *Health Net of California Inc., the company's California division, incorporated in 1977 *Founded as QualMed Oregon Health Plan, it was officially renamed Health Net Health Plan of Oregon in 2000, Inc. *Health Net of Arizona, Inc. was founded in 1981, as Intergroup of Arizona by a multi-specialty medical group in Tucson. In 1994, Intergroup became a wholly owned subsidiary of Foundation Health Corporation. On July 2, 2015, Centene Corporation announced it would acquire Health Net for $6.8 billion. Upon completion, Health Net shareholders will own 29% of the combined company. Health Net of California Inc. president, Steve Sell, explained that the merger will benefit the consumers as the said deal was meant to strengthen Health Net's business. However, health advocates were not easily convinced due to the company's major deficiencies that were identified in 2013 by state regulators. On June 20, 2017, Health Net Federal Services, LLC, (HNFS) a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC), announced it has earned the Health Network Accreditation from URAC, an independent organization that promotes healthcare quality through accreditation, certification and measurement. In 2018, Health Net in Arizona was merged into other Centene holdings to form Arizona Complete Health. =Divestures= In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group bought Health Net's northeastern licensed subsidiaries for $450 million. At the time, the subsidiaries had 578,000 members in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. In January 2012, Health Net sold its Medicare Prescription Drug Plan business to a subsidiary of CVS Caremark for approximately $160 million in cash.

It makes charitable contributions to organizations that promote wellness and preventive care, combat childhood obesity and support health programs for military families in communities where Health Net does business. Health Net launched its Foundation in September 2007 by providing a Three-Year $1.35 Million Grant to the American Heart Association. The Health Net Foundation has provided other grants such as the $175,000 given to twelve California school-based health centers and community medical clinics to improve dental care and oral health. =Other sponsorships= In addition to its Foundation, Health Net Federal Services has also participated in philanthropic causes. The division established a scholarship to be administered through National Military Family Association (NMFA) designating $150,000 to be awarded to military spouses in the TRICARE North Region. Health Net Federal Services sponsors military-related sports-related events and veterans' sports clinics such as the National Veterans Golden Age Games in Honolulu and the Veterans Wheelchair Games. Since the 1980s, Health Net has been a sponsor of the March of Dimes' largest fundraising event, March for Babies. In 2008, more than 300 Health Net associates walked in March for Babies events across California contributing more than $325,000 through various fund-raising efforts. For a number of years, Health Net sponsored the Health Net Pro Cycling Team, which now is sponsored by UnitedHealth Group. Health Net Pro Cycling Team Presented by Maxxis was run by Momentum Sports Group and based in the United States. Health Net won the team title in the 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 USA Cycling National Racing Calendar series competitions.  Quality of care  In California's Health Care Quality Report Card 2011 Edition by California's Office of the Patient Advocate, Health Net (CA) received 2 out of 4 stars in Meeting National Standards of Care.  Controversies  = Restatement = On February 11, 2004, the company restated its results for the first three-quarters of 2003 and for the full years of 2002 and 2001. The adjustments amounted to a $4.4 million increase in net income for the first three-quarters of 2003, or about 3 cents a share. = Patsy Bates lawsuit = In 2007, Patsy Bates, a California beautician, sued Health Net claiming that they wrongfully terminated her care in the middle of her chemotherapy treatments. An internal company employee performance review made public during the lawsuit revealed that one of the company's managers had tied bonuses to the rescission rate for one analyst in charge of rescission reviews to discover reasons (such as application fraud) to discontinue coverage to enrollees. The company pointed out that Bates had withheld critical information - that she had damaged her heart by the use of fen-phen for diet purposes and stated an inaccurate weight; Bates replied that the insurance broker had filled out the form for her and she had been busy in her salon. In February 2008, the court ruled in favor of Bates, ordering Health Net to pay $8.4 million in punitive damages and $750,000 for emotional distress. = Connecticut Attorney General investigation = In November 2009, Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal said Health Net lost the personal information of nearly 450,000 state residents and \\"failed to inform consumers for six months.\\" The data on the drive was unencrypted and included information about financial, health, and personal information. It was discovered missing from the company's Connecticut office. Health Net circulated a letter to customers in December 2009, including an offer of free credit protection from a company called Debix for two years. = CMS suspension = On November 19, 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) immediately suspended Health Net because the insurer improperly administered the Medicare drug benefit in contracts for its national prescription drug plan and local Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans. The suspension required Health Net to cease marketing and enrollment of new members of all Health Net Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) and stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) contracts, effective November 20, 2010. The sanctions relate to compliance with certain Part D requirements. The suspension did not affect existing Health Net Medicare enrollees. Although the company was allowed to resume marketing its Medicare products in August 2011, on January 6, 2012, the company agreed to sell its Medicare stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) business to CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) for about $160 million in cash. Health Net would continue to provide prescription drug plans as part of its Medicare Advantage plan offerings. = Network data breach = On March 14, 2011, Health Net disclosed that nine server drives, containing personal information of 1.9 million members and providers, went missing in transit from its Rancho Cordova (CA) data center to an IBM data center in Boulder (CO). The insurer found out about the security lapse on January 21 when IBM, which manages the company's IT infrastructure, informed Health Net it was unable to locate the missing server drives. Health Net's missing computer records represent the largest data breach reported to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) website and the third largest medical information breach in the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse database. The data breach effects roughly 1.9 million people including 845,000 Californians, 100,000 Oregonians, 3,500 Vermonters and thousands more in other states. The company offered two years free credit monitoring along with identity theft insurance to those affected. The Californian Department of Managed Health Care and the Department of Insurance have announced separate investigations into the breach. =Los Angeles County Medical Association lawsuit= On September 13, 2012, the Los Angeles County Medical Association joined two patients in suing Health Net for illegally denying medically necessary treatment, including cancer care. The lawsuit alleges that Health Net routinely and systematically denies claims based on its own definition of \\"medical necessity\\", violating well-established standards set forth by California law. According to the suit, Health Net is \\"the leader\\" in this calculated corporate practice to avoid paying claims. =Memorandum of Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General= In September 2017, VA Inspector General Michael Missal issued a memorandum that listed four major “errors” that had resulted in excess payments to Health Net. These were: *Duplicate Errors–Payments for medical claims that have been paid more than once; *Other Health Insurance8 (OHI) Errors–Payments that were not adjusted for the amount OHI was responsible to pay the provider; *Pass-Through Errors–Payments to reimburse the third-party administrator (TPA) that were more than the TPA paid the provider and; *Rate Errors–Payments that did not use the appropriate Medicare or contract adjusted rate Missal stated that duplicate payments alone accumulated over $50 million in overpayments to Health net.

HBC sought to grow by acquisition, but the first three attempts to buy an existing institution were unsuccessful. HBC acquired the assets of Bank of British Columbia on November 27, 1986, which had essentially failed. This acquisition gave HBC an additional $2.6 billion in assets and 41 branches in British Columbia and Alberta propelling it overnight from the 20th largest to 9th largest bank in Canada. On May 20, 1988, HBC amalgamated with Midland Bank Canada, gaining many new corporate banking relationships, combined assets of $472 million, and expanding to Eastern Canada. It acquired Lloyds Bank Canada on May 29, 1990, thereby adding another $4.4 billion in assets and 53 branches. Lloyds Bank had acquired Continental Bank of Canada in 1986. Continental Bank began in 1973 as Niagara Finance Company, later became IAC Limited, and then Continental Bank. By October 31, 1990, HBC's assets were $10.2 billion and its branch network had doubled with most of its newly acquired branches located in Ontario and Quebec. The acquisition of Lloyds also made the company Canada's largest foreign bank and a bilingual operation with branches in eight Quebec communities. On April 30, 1993, HBC acquired ANZ Canada consisting of one office in Toronto, which it combined with the existing HBC branch at 70 York Street. ANZ had acquired Grindlays Bank Canada with its 1984 acquisition of Grindlays Bank, but management sold the component to HBC to focus on expansion in the Asia-Pacific area. The purchase of ANZ made HBC the seventh largest bank in Canada with branches in every province except Prince Edward Island. HBC acquired the single-office Metropolitan Trust Company of Canada on August 1, 1995. HBC acquired Barclays Bank Canada on August 31, 1996. Barclays had re-entered Canada in 1979 and developed a diversified but modest range of activities. In 1985, Barclays bought the assets of Wells Fargo Bank (Canada), consisting of its operations in Alberta and Florida, so that Wells Fargo could re-focus on its home market. In 1993, Barclays Bank Canada closed its Edmonton branch and the following year, it closed six additional branches in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, London, Montreal and Halifax, retaining only its head office. Barclays' Canadian operations lost approximately $120-million between 1992 and 1996. In response to the growing north-south trade occasioned by the adoption of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), HBC acquired the Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon branches of Marine Midland Bank in 1996. This move into the United States seemed a natural expansion that followed the business interests of many of the bank's customers. HBC acquired National Westminster Bank of Canada on May 1, 1998, which had assets of C$844.5 million. NatWest had entered Canada in 1982. On June 21, 1999, HBC changed its name to HSBC Bank Canada, consistent with the HSBC Group's strategy of creating the global brand, HSBC. On December 3 of that year, it acquired Prenor Trust Company of Canada. In 2000, HSBC Bank Canada acquired Republic National Bank of New York (Canada) after HSBC acquired the parent bank. Republic had entered Canada in 1982, and was an amalgamation of several banks. Republic's purchases included Bank Leumi Le Israel (Canada) in 1993; Israel-based Bank Hapoalim (Canada) in 1994; and Israel Discount Bank of Canada's in 1996. On April 1, 2001, HSBC Canada acquired CCF Canada after HSBC Holdings acquired CCF Canada's parent company, Crédit Commercial de France (CCF). CCF had just acquired Crédit Lyonnais Canada. Credit Commercial de France (Canada) had entered Canada in 1982 when it established an office in Montreal. Société Genérale (Canada) acquired it in 1990. CCF had returned to Canada in 2000. In 2002, HSBC Holdings merged its Canadian and US operations to create a North American transnational bank. HSBC Bank USA of New York, with assets of US$87 billion, and HSBC Canada, with assets of C$34 billion, share some operating resources but remain separate units. On June 1, 2004, HSBC Bank Canada completed its acquisition of Intesa Bank's Canadian unit, which had 11 branches and total assets of C$1.1 billion. On September 20, 2011, HSBC Canada sold its full- service brokerage division, HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc., to National Bank Financial Group for C$208 million.

She was awarded a contract with WWE after co-winning the second series of the reality television show Tough Enough with Linda Miles. Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Entertainment= Tough Enough and debut (2002–2003) As soon as Gayda was awarded the Tough Enough II contract, she worked several matches on the Raw and SmackDown! brands. Gayda turned villainous on an episode of WWE Velocity by pushing her co-winner Linda Miles off the top rope causing her to lose her match against Ivory. Five days later on SmackDown!, Gayda teamed up with Ivory in a losing effort against Miles and Trish Stratus in a tag team match. In another one of her first television matches (a tag team match with Christopher Nowinski against Trish Stratus and Bradshaw on the July 8, 2002 episode of Raw from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that became known by wrestling fans as \\"that Jackie Gayda match\\"), Gayda botched multiple moves, the most infamous of which was a second-rope-bulldog by Stratus, which she sold too late. Commentator Jim Ross exclaimed that \\"mercifully, it's over\\" at the end of the match, expressing relief that the poor wrestling attempts had ceased. She was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling for further training. While in OVW, she joined the stable known as \\"The Revolution\\", in addition to managing The Basham Brothers and Chris Kanyon. On June 16, 2003, she returned to WWE as Miss Jackie, managing Rico. She would later turn face after Rico's face turn. Various feuds and SmackDown! (2004–2005) Gayda during a WWE house show in 2005 In early 2004, Gayda teamed up with Stacy Keibler, with the duo proclaiming themselves to be the WWE's hottest divas and thought they deserved to grace the cover of Playboy magazine. This provoked a feud with SmackDown! divas and the Playboy co-cover girls Sable and Torrie Wilson. At WrestleMania XX, Gayda and Keibler were defeated by Sable and Wilson in a Playboy evening gown match. In the second WWE Draft, Gayda and Rico were traded to SmackDown! brand, where they eventually teamed up with Charlie Haas. In September 2004, Haas and Gayda were engaged, and their relationship was eventually incorporated into their on- screen characters. Dawn Marie announced the engagement of Gayda and Haas on the September 30 episode of SmackDown!, implying in the process that she and Haas were \\"more than just friends\\". This led to a catfight between Gayda and Dawn, which in turn led to an intergender tag match at No Mercy pitting Gayda, Haas, and Rico against Dawn and the Dudley Boyz. Gayda's team won the bout, yet Dawn Marie predicted that the relationship would not last very long. From that moment onwards, Dawn Marie tried her hardest to split the couple up. On the October 7 episode of SmackDown!, Gayda found herself on the receiving end of Billy Kidman's BK Bomb. She sold her injuries through the October tour of Europe by wearing a neckbrace, only returning to action on the October 28 episode of SmackDown! in Omaha, Nebraska, which saw Gayda hit the ring during a Halloween costume contest between Dawn and Torrie Wilson, spearing Dawn and tearing the clothes from her body. A vengeful Dawn then screamed to Gayda that it was not over. Dawn gained her revenge during an arm wrestling contest on the November 4 episode of SmackDown!, headbutting Gayda and catfighting with her until Haas made the save. Dawn's ally Heidenreich then decimated Haas, dismissing Gayda's attempts to protect Haas by shoving her to the mat. On November 25 Gayda tried to gain revenge in a \\"Pilgrim versus Indian\\" match, but both women were disqualified for ignoring the referee's instructions. The two divas fought once again on December 2, this time while wearing Christmas outfits. General Manager Theodore Long finally announced a final encounter at Armageddon, appointing Haas as referee. Gayda lost the match, and her fianceé, as the relationship was broken when Haas revealed he had an affair with Dawn Marie. He then rejected Marie afterwards, saying he did not want either woman. Gayda began wrestling as a singles performer. She appeared in numerous vignettes with the other divas until she and Haas were released from WWE on July 5, 2005, along with many other WWE wrestlers. =Independent circuit (2005–2006)= Gayda began working for several independent promotions, including Ballpark Brawl, where Gayda was referred to as Just Jackie and defeated Traci Brooks, Nattie Neidhart, Jamie D, and April Hunter on August 13, 2005. She also teamed with Hunter in a loss to Neidhart on August 14, 2005. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2006)= On the November 26, 2005 episode of Impact!, Gayda made her debut lashing out at Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett was shocked and frightened by Gayda's unexpected appearance and soon ordered her backstage. He was heard saying, \\"It's not what you think.\\" After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, the same thing happened in the main event match, but Gayda was restrained by officials. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there had nothing to do with a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, she turned on the television to see Kim in her place. She said she had a big secret about Jarrett that TNA Management would love to hear, but did not reveal what it was. Gayda won TNA's Knockout of the Year 2005 on the January 14, 2006 episode of Impact!. At Final Resolution, she ran into Raven after he lost his match. She told him that they had something in common, they were both being screwed by TNA Management. On the January 28 episode of Impact!, Gayda came down to ringside during a Jarrett versus Jay Lethal match, to hand an audio tape to Kim. She then left, with a confused Kim soon following. Jarrett then hired Alex Shelley to video tape Gayda at her home, for blackmail. Shelley complied, returning a week later with a videotape. On the February 18, 2006 episode of Impact!, she told Jarrett that he had won and that she would leave. Jarrett refused to comply and used the tape Shelley compiled of Gayda as blackmail to get her to join his stable. Jackie became the manager of Planet Jarrett. She feuded with Gail Kim in mid-2006. At Sacrifice Jackie announced that she was pregnant, so Kim kayfabe fired her. She was later released from her contract. =Return to independent circuit (2010–2011)= Gayda in September 2008 In April 2009, Gayda returned to WWE for one-night only as a part of the 25 Diva battle royal at WrestleMania XXV. On August 30, 2010, Mexican promotion Perros del Mal Producciones announced that Gayda, under the ring name Miss Jackie, would wrestle for the promotion on September 16, on the same card as her husband Charlie Haas. At the event Jackie and Celestial defeated Jennifer Blake and Mini Chessman in a tag team match. She appeared again on February 11, 2011, on the Viva La Lucha PPV, teaming with NY Knockout Nikki to take on Christina Von Eerie and Jennifer Blake (a match that she won for her team, via crossbody into a pin). On August 20, 2011, Haas became her husband's manager where he became the inaugural Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) Heavyweight Champion by defeating Jay Lethal and Eric Young. He held the championship for four months before losing it to Young on December 17, the same night Jackie made her in-ring debut for FWE in a loss to Winter.  Personal life  Gayda married fellow professional wrestler Charlie Haas in 2005. The couple have four children: Kayla (born 2006), Taylor (born 2008), Thomas (born 2010), and Charles (born 2012). In 2008, Haas and Gayda opened the \\"Custom Muscle Nutrition and Smoothie Shop\\", a nutritional store, in Frisco, Texas.

It is the town with the highest rate of millionaires relating to the population in North Rhine-Westphalia(2004). Geography Schalksmühle is located in the hills of the Sauerland, and the altitude of the 38.2 km² area varies between 183 m (Pulvermühle) and 502 m (east of Sonnenscheid) above sea level. 45% of the area is covered by forest, another 35% is used for agricultural purposes. The main river is the Volme, a tributary of the Ruhr. History The oldest written documents on the municipality date back to 1350, when the farmers of Hülscheid formed a free duchy. The largest extent of the Freigrafschaft Hülscheid was in 1478, when it contained not only the Kirchspiel Hülscheid, but also the northwestern part of the Kirchspiel Lüdenscheid. Schalksmühle itself was first mentioned on May 1, 1407 in a document by archbishop Friedrich of Cologne, when Gerwin of Altenbreckerfeld, a merchant, donated an altar to the church of Breckerfeld. One of the villages leased by Gerwin was Schalksmollen in parrochia Halvere (Schalksmühle in the parish Halver). The municipality in its modern boundaries was created during the communal reforms of 1969/70. Becoming effective on January 1, 1969 the municipality Schalksmühle was merged with the municipality Hülscheid (previously in the Amt Lüdenscheid). On January 1, 1970 the municipality Dahlerbrück (previously in the Amt Breckerfeld, district Ennepe- Ruhr) was also added to it. Coat of arms The coat of arms combined the symbols of the two municipalities merged in 1969. The top part shows the upper half of a black mill wheel (Mühle is German for mill), the symbol for Schalksmühle. In the bottom are three leaves of European Holly (Ilex aquifolium), which was taken from the coat of arms of the municipality Hülscheid. As no traditional symbols were found for Hülscheid a \\"talking symbol\\" was chosen - Hülsebusch is one of several traditional German names of the Ilex. The two symbols are separated by a red-and-white chequered bordure as the symbol of the counts of the Mark. The coat of arms was granted on July 21, 1970. Before 1969 the coat of arms of the municipality was very similar to the current one, except that the bottom part of the shield was a simple golden field. That coat of arms was granted on March 29, 1935. The coat of arms of the municipality of Hülscheid had the Ilex leaves instead of the mill wheel in top. That coat of arms was granted on January 16, 1935. Both were designed by Otto Hupp, based on an idea of Fritz Thomée, former Landrat of the district Altena. Twin towns Schalksmühle is twinned with two towns. Since July 1987 it has had a partnership with Ruhla in Thuringia (at that time in East Germany). Since 1970 it has had a partnership with the English district of Wansbeck in Northumberland. This originated when a young man (Klaus Floeren) from Iserlohn worked for some time in the town of Bedlington and met his future wife (Muriel Binks) there. After moving to Schalksmühle with their young son Rolf, the couple suggested a partnership between the two communities. When Bedlington town council was merged with Ashington and Newbiggin-by-the-Sea to form the district of Wansbeck, the partnership was continued by the new district council.

It generalises the concept of parallel lines. It can also be defined as a *curve whose points are at a fixed normal distance from a given curve. These two definitions are not entirely equivalent as the latter assumes smoothness, whereas the former does not. In computer-aided design the preferred term for a parallel curve is offset curve. (In other geometric contexts, the term offset can also refer to translation.) Offset curves are important for example in numerically controlled machining, where they describe for example the shape of the cut made by a round cutting tool of a two-axis machine. The shape of the cut is offset from the trajectory of the cutter by a constant distance in the direction normal to the cutter trajectory at every point. In the area of 2D computer graphics known as vector graphics, the (approximate) computation of parallel curves is involved in one of the fundamental drawing operations, called stroking, which is typically applied to polylines or polybeziers (themselves called paths) in that field.http://www.slideshare.net/Mark_Kilgard/22pathrender, p. 28 Except in the case of a line or circle, the parallel curves have a more complicated mathematical structure than the progenitor curve. For example, even if the progenitor curve is smooth, its offsets may not be so; this property is illustrated in the top figure, using a sine curve as progenitor curve. In general, even if a curve is rational, its offsets may not be so. For example, the offsets of a parabola are rational curves, but the offsets of an ellipse or of a hyperbola are not rational, even though these progenitor curves themselves are rational. The notion also generalizes to 3D surfaces, where it is called an offset surface. Increasing a solid volume by a (constant) distance offset is sometimes called dilation.http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jarek/papers/localVolume.pdf, p. 3 The opposite operation is sometimes called shelling. Offset surfaces are important in numerically controlled machining, where they describe the shape of the cut made by a ball nose end mill of a three-axis machine. Other shapes of cutting bits can be modelled mathematically by general offset surfaces.  Parallel curve of a parametrically given curve  If there is a regular parametric representation \\\\vec x= (x(t),y(t)) of the given curve available, the second definition of a parallel curve (s. above) leads to the following parametric representation of the parallel curve with distance d : : \\\\vec x_d(t)=\\\\vec x(t)+d\\\\vec n(t) with the unit normal \\\\vec n(t). In cartesian coordinates: : x_d(t)= x(t)+\\\\frac{d\\\\; y'(t)}{\\\\sqrt {x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2}} : y_d(t)= y(t)-\\\\frac{d\\\\; x'(t)}{\\\\sqrt {x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2}} \\\\ . Distance parameter d may be negative, too. In this case one gets a parallel curve on the opposite side of the curve (see diagram on the parallel curves of a circle). One easily checks: a parallel curve of a line is a parallel line in the common sense and the parallel curve of a circle is a concentric circle. =Geometric properties:E.

These are the points where the curve touches the evolute. *If the progenitor curve is a boundary of a planar set and its parallel curve is without self-intersections, then the latter is the boundary of the Minkowski sum of the planar set and the disk of the given radius. If the given curve is polynomial (meaning that x(t) and y(t) are polynomials), then the parallel curves are usually not polynomial. In CAD area this is a drawback, because CAD systems use polynomials or rational curves. In order to get at least rational curves, the square root of the representation of the parallel curve has to be solvable. Such curves are called pythagorean hodograph curves and were investigated by R.T. Farouki.Rida T. Farouki: Pythagorean-Hodograph Curves: Algebra and Geometry Inseparable (Geometry and Computing). Springer, 2008, .  Parallel curves of an implicit curve  Parallel curves of the implicit curve (red) with equation x^4+y^4-1=0 Generally the analytic representation of a parallel curve of an implicit curve is not possible. Only for the simple cases of lines and circles the parallel curves can be described easily. For example: : Line \\\\; f(x,y)=x+y-1=0\\\\; → distance function: \\\\; h(x,y)=\\\\frac{x+y-1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}=d\\\\; (Hesse normalform) : Circle \\\\; f(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1=0\\\\; → distancefunction: \\\\; h(x,y)=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-1=d\\\\; . In general, presuming certain conditions, one can prove the existence of an oriented distance function h(x,y). In practice one has to treat it numerically.E. Hartmann: Geometry and Algorithms for COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN. S. 81, S. 30, 41, 44. Considering parallel curves the following is true: * The parallel curve for distance d is the level set h(x,y)=d of the corresponding oriented distance function h. =Properties of the distance function: J.A.

Further examples  Involutes of a circle *The involutes of a given curve are a set of parallel curves. For example: the involutes of a circle are parallel spirals (see diagram).

In particular, a cubic Bezier curve has as (two-sided) offsets algebraic curves of degree 10. Parallel curve to a curve with a corner Parallel curves to a curve with a discontinuous normal around a corner When determining the cutting path of part with a sharp corner for machining, you must define the parallel (offset) curve to a given curve that has a discontinous normal at the corner. Even though the given curve is not smooth at the sharp corner, its parallel curve may be smooth with a continuous normal, or it may have may have cusps when the distance from the curve matches the radius of curvature at the sharp corner. =Normal fans= As described above, the parametric representation of a parallel curve, \\\\vec x_d(t), to a given curver, \\\\vec x(t), with distance d is: :\\\\vec x_d(t) = \\\\vec x(t) + d\\\\vec n(t) with the unit normal \\\\vec n(t). At a sharp corner (t = t_c), the normal to \\\\vec x(t_c) given by \\\\vec n(t_c) is discontinuous, meaning the one-sided limit of the normal from the left \\\\vec n(t_c^-) is unequal to the limit from the right \\\\vec n(t_c^+). Mathematically, :\\\\vec n(t_c^-) = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to t_c^-}\\\\vec n(t) e \\\\vec n(t_c^+) = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to t_c^+}\\\\vec n(t). Normal fan for defining parallel curves around a sharp corner However, we can define a normal fan \\\\vec n_f(\\\\alpha) that provides an interpolant between \\\\vec n(t_c^-) and \\\\vec n(t_c^+), and use \\\\vec n_f(\\\\alpha) in place of \\\\vec n(t_c) at the sharp corner: :\\\\vec n_f(\\\\alpha) = \\\\frac{(1 - \\\\alpha)\\\\vec n(t_c^-) + \\\\alpha\\\\vec n(t_c^+)}{\\\\lVert (1 - \\\\alpha)\\\\vec n(t_c^-) + \\\\alpha\\\\vec n(t_c^+) \\\\rVert},\\\\quadwhere 0 < \\\\alpha < 1. The resulting definition of the parallel curve \\\\vec x_d(t) provides the desired behavior: :\\\\vec x_d(t) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\vec x(t) + d\\\\vec n(t), & \\\\text{if }t < t_c\\\\text{ or }t > t_c  \\\\vec x(t_c) + d\\\\vec n_f(\\\\alpha), & \\\\text{if }t = t_c\\\\text{ where }0 < \\\\alpha < 1 \\\\end{cases}  Algorithms  An efficient algorithm for offsetting is the level approach described by Kimel and Bruckstein (1993). Kimmel and Bruckstein (1993) Shape offsets via level sets CAD (Computer Aided Design) 25(3):154-162\\\\. There are numerous approximation algorithms for this problem. For a 1997 survey, see Elber, Lee and Kim's \\"Comparing Offset Curve Approximation Methods\\".http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/cg/1997/03/mcg1997030062.pdf  Parallel (offset) surfaces  Offset surface of a complex irregular shape Offset surfaces are important in numerically controlled machining, where they describe the shape of the cut made by a ball nose end mill of a three-axis mill. If there is a regular parametric representation \\\\vec x(u,v) = (x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)) of the given surface available, the second definition of a parallel curve (see above) generalizes to the following parametric representation of the parallel surface with distance d : : \\\\vec x_d(u,v)=\\\\vec x(u,v)+d\\\\vec n(u,v) with the unit normal \\\\vec n_d(u,v) = {{{\\\\partial \\\\vec x \\\\over \\\\partial u} \\\\times {\\\\partial \\\\vec x \\\\over \\\\partial v}} \\\\over {{{\\\\partial \\\\vec x \\\\over \\\\partial u} \\\\times {\\\\partial \\\\vec x \\\\over \\\\partial v}}}}. Distance parameter d may be negative, too. In this case one gets a parallel surface on the opposite side of the surface (see similar diagram on the parallel curves of a circle). One easily checks: a parallel surface of a plane is a parallel plane in the common sense and the parallel surface of a sphere is a concentric sphere. =Geometric properties:= *{\\\\partial \\\\vec x_d \\\\over \\\\partial u} \\\\parallel {\\\\partial \\\\vec x \\\\over \\\\partial u}, \\\\quad {\\\\partial \\\\vec x_d \\\\over \\\\partial v} \\\\parallel {\\\\partial \\\\vec x \\\\over \\\\partial v}, \\\\quad that means: the tangent vectors for fixed parameters are parallel. *\\\\vec n_d(u,v) = \\\\pm\\\\vec n(u,v), \\\\quad that means: the normal vectors for fixed parameters match direction. *S_d = (1 + d S)^{-1} S, \\\\quad where S_d and S are the shape operators for \\\\vec x_d and \\\\vec x, respectively. :The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace. *S_d^{-1} = S^{-1} + d I, \\\\quad where S_d^{-1} and S^{-1} are the inverses of the shape operators for \\\\vec x_d and \\\\vec x, respectively. :The principal radii of curvature are the eigenvalues of the inverse of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the reciprocal of the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean radius of curvature is half its trace. Note the similarity to the geometric properties of parallel curves.  Generalizations  The problem generalizes fairly obviously to higher dimensions e.g. to offset surfaces, and slightly less trivially to pipe surfaces. Note that the terminology for the higher- dimensional versions varies even more widely than in the planar case, e.g. other authors speak of parallel fibers, ribbons, and tubes. For curves embedded in 3D surfaces the offset may be taken along a geodesic. Another way to generalize it is (even in 2D) to consider a variable distance, e.g. parametrized by another curve. One can for example stroke (envelope) with an ellipse instead of circle as it is possible for example in METAFONT.https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb16-3/tb48kinc.pdf An envelope of ellipses forming two general offset curves above and below a given curve More recently Adobe Illustrator has added somewhat similar facility in version CS5, although the control points for the variable width are visually specified.http://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/illustrator-cs5-variable-width- stroke-tool-perfect-for-making-tribal-designs--vector-4346 application of the generalized version in Adobe Illustrator CS5 (also video) In contexts where it's important to distinguish between constant and variable distance offsetting the acronyms CDO and VDO are sometimes used. =General offset curves= Assume you have a regular parametric representation of a curve, \\\\vec x(t) = (x(t),y(t)), and you have a second curve that can be parameterized by its unit normal, \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n), where the normal of \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) = \\\\vec n (this parameterization by normal exists for curves whose curvature is strictly positive or negative, and thus convex, smooth, and not straight). The parametric representation of the general offset curve of \\\\vec x(t) offset by \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) is: : \\\\vec x_d(t)=\\\\vec x(t)+ \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(t)), \\\\quad where \\\\vec n(t) is the unit normal of \\\\vec x(t). Note that the trival offset, \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) = d\\\\vec n, gives you ordinary parallel (aka, offset) curves. Geometric properties: *\\\\vec x'_d(t) \\\\parallel \\\\vec x'(t),\\\\quad that means: the tangent vectors for a fixed parameter are parallel. *As for parallel lines, a normal to a curve is also normal to its general offsets. *k_d(t)=\\\\dfrac{k(t)}{1+\\\\dfrac{k(t)}{k_n(t)}},\\\\quad with k_d(t) the curvature of the general offset curve, k(t) the curvature of \\\\vec x(t), and k_n(t) the curvature of \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(t)) for parameter t. *R_d(t)=R(t) + R_n(t),\\\\quad with R_d(t) the radius of curvature of the general offset curve, R(t) the radius of curvature of \\\\vec x(t), and R_n(t) the radius of curvature of \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(t)) for parameter t. *When general offset curves are constructed they will have cusps when the curvature of the curve matches curvature of the offset. These are the points where the curve touches the evolute. =General offset surfaces= General offset surfaces describe the shape of cuts made by a variety of cutting bits used by three-axis end mills in numerically controlled machining. Assume you have a regular parametric representation of a surface, \\\\vec x(u,v) = (x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)), and you have a second surface that can be parameterized by its unit normal, \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n), where the normal of \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) = \\\\vec n (this parameterization by normal exists for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is strictly positive, and thus convex, smooth, and not flat). The parametric representation of the general offset surface of \\\\vec x(t) offset by \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) is: : \\\\vec x_d(u,v)=\\\\vec x(u,v)+ \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(u,v)), \\\\quad where \\\\vec n(u,v) is the unit normal of \\\\vec x(u,v). Note that the trival offset, \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) = d\\\\vec n, gives you ordinary parallel (aka, offset) surfaces. Geometric properties: *As for parallel lines, the tangent plane of a surface is parallel to the tangent plane of its general offsets. *As for parallel lines, a normal to a surface is also normal to its general offsets. *S_d = (1 + SS_n^{-1})^{-1} S, \\\\quad where S_d, S, and S_n are the shape operators for \\\\vec x_d, \\\\vec x, and \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n), respectively. :The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace. *S_d^{-1} = S^{-1} + S_n^{-1}, \\\\quad where S_d^{-1}, S^{-1} and S_n^{-1} are the inverses of the shape operators for \\\\vec x_d, \\\\vec x, and \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n), respectively. :The principal radii of curvature are the eigenvalues of the inverse of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the reciprocal of the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean radius of curvature is half its trace. Note the similarity to the geometric properties of general offset curves. =Derivation of geometric properties for general offsets= The geometric properties listed above for general offset curves and surfaces can be derived for offsets of arbitrary dimension. Assume you have a regular parametric representation of an n-dimensional surface, \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u), where the dimension of \\\\vec u is n-1. Also assume you have a second n-dimensional surface that can be parameterized by its unit normal, \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n), where the normal of \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) = \\\\vec n (this parameterization by normal exists for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is strictly positive, and thus convex, smooth, and not flat). The parametric representation of the general offset surface of \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u) offset by \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) is: : \\\\vec x_d(\\\\vec u) = \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u)+ \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(\\\\vec u)), \\\\quad where \\\\vec n(\\\\vec u) is the unit normal of \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u). (The trival offset, \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n) = d\\\\vec n, gives you ordinary parallel surfaces.) First, notice that the normal of \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u) = the normal of \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(\\\\vec u)) = \\\\vec n(\\\\vec u), by definition. Now, we'll apply the differential w.r.t. \\\\vec u to \\\\vec x_d, which gives us its tangent vectors spanning its tangent plane. : \\\\partial\\\\vec x_d(\\\\vec u) = \\\\partial\\\\vec x(\\\\vec u)+ \\\\partial\\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(\\\\vec u)) Notice, the tangent vectors for \\\\vec x_d are the sum of tangent vectors for \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u) and its offset \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n), which share the same unit normal. Thus, the general offset surface shares the same tangent plane and normal with \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u) and \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(\\\\vec u)). That aligns with the nature of envelopes. We now consider the Weingarten equations for the shape operator, which can be written as \\\\partial\\\\vec n = -\\\\partial\\\\vec xS. If S is invertable, \\\\partial\\\\vec x = -\\\\partial\\\\vec nS^{-1}. Recall that the principal curvatures of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gauss curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace. The inverse of the shape operator holds these same values for the radii of curvature. Substituting into the equation for the differential of \\\\vec x_d, we get: : \\\\partial\\\\vec x_d = \\\\partial\\\\vec x - \\\\partial\\\\vec n S_n^{-1},\\\\quad where S_n is the shape operator for \\\\vec d(\\\\vec n(\\\\vec u)). Next, we use the Weingarten equations again to replace \\\\partial\\\\vec n: :\\\\partial\\\\vec x_d = \\\\partial\\\\vec x + \\\\partial\\\\vec x S S_n^{-1},\\\\quad where S is the shape operator for \\\\vec x(\\\\vec u). Then, we solve for \\\\partial\\\\vec x and multiple both sides by -S to get back to the Weingarten equations, this time for \\\\partial\\\\vec x_d: :\\\\partial\\\\vec x_d (I + S S_n^{-1})^{-1} = \\\\partial\\\\vec x, :-\\\\partial\\\\vec x_d (I + S S_n^{-1})^{-1}S = -\\\\partial\\\\vec xS = \\\\partial\\\\vec n. Thus, S_d = (I + S S_n^{-1})^{-1}S, and inverting both sides gives us, S_d^{-1} = S^{-1} + S_n^{-1}.

It succeeded the earlier Toronto Savings Bank, which had been founded in 1854 by Bishop Armand-François-Marie de Charbonnel and the local chapter of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and later Home Savings and Loans in 1871. The failure of Home Bank on August 18, 1923, was the subject of a Canadian Royal Commission initiated by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1924. Founded with the support of the Roman Catholic Church, James Mason and Henry Pellatt represented a benign board of directors including E.G. Gooderham, Claude Macdonnell and three other directors from Winnipeg, Manitoba affiliated with the United Grain Growers. Early controversies Early in its history a number of questionable loans were advanced, including one to A.C. Frost Company to buy timber rights in British Columbia, and another to the New Orleans Gouther and Grand Isle Railway secured by a rolling stock of dilapidated rail cars. In 1912 it undertook a campaign of expanding into Quebec and eastern Canada, to the chagrin of the western Canadian Directors who were seeing much of the bank's capital unavailable for western loans. At the same time, many of the large loans went unpaid and the accrued interest, through a form of bank fraud, was recapitalized onto the principal of the loans. William Machaffie, Manager of the Winnipeg Branch and a banker since 1882, told the western directors as early as 1914 that the \\"cooking of the books\\" through the adding of unpaid interest to the principal and then calculating the interest as profit to pay dividends to major shareholders and directors was wrong. Machaffie wanted to tell the minister of finance at the time, Thomas White, but the western directors were not so sure. The federal government of the day was not prepared to deal with a bank crisis during wartime. After a leave of absence in 1917 Machaffie returned to his desk to find his position was gone. He wrote a letter to the Minister of Finance which outlined issues regarding bad loans, capitalization of unpaid interest, and accounting malpractice at head office, and stated the only hope for the bank's survival was a merger. He decided not to send the letter to the minister but instead to the Board to \\"stir things up a bit\\". He was fired. On August 29, 1918, he drafted a new letter and this time sent it to the Minister of Finance outlining his concerns and a litany of delinquent and non-arm's length loans and issues related to serious flaws in the Home Bank's internal auditing process. Collapse The post-war period brought prosperity and the inflationary boom gave Home Bank its share of the Canadian penchant for saving money. The bank opened 28 new branches (for a total of 82) between 1921 and 1923. Though this period, under greater government scrutiny and with the death of Senator James Mason in 1918, the new president of the bank, Herbert Daly was challenged to \\"keep all the balls in the air at the same time\\". The major chartered banks intervened in 1920 to control rising prices by raising interest rates. Demand for credit fell and the resulting recession drove prices down dramatically, making assets worth less than the money loaned to acquire them. During this time, and with the dust storms of the 1922–1923 drought, many farmers lost their land and livelihood. The indifference of the Eastern banking community led to the success of populist parties in Western Canada and Ontario. In 1922 the United Grain Growers, whose officers comprised the western bank board members, sold all of their shares in the bank. At the same time the Western Canada Pulp and Paper Company had defaulted and, in the spring of 1923 the bank asked Mackenzie King's government for help, which was refused. The stock plummeted and depositors withdrew money in ever-swelling streams. On the August civic-holiday, J. Cooper Mason, son of the founder and a director, retired to his study and committed suicide. The Canadian National Railway, whose director Richard F. Gough was also a member of the bank's board, withdrew $1 million just before the collapse. The bank closed for good August 17, 1923. Ten officials from Home Bank were arrested on charges ranging from concurring with false returns to fraud on October 4, 1923 at a time when the bank's assets were estimated at $2.7 million and liabilities at $15.5 million. 60,000 prairie farmers and a substantial portion of Toronto's Catholic community lost their savings. In the panic that followed the bank's closure, the Ontario Government shored up the Dominion Bank with $1.5 million to stop a deposit run. Herbert Daly, the Home Bank president, was unable to testify after a nervous breakdown and he died on October 22, 1923. Cabinet secrecy rules protected politicians from any liability in the matter and, in a precedent setting bailout, the federal government agreed to pay $5,450,000 to depositors (deposit insurance was not enacted until 1967 in Canada), providing some settlement to the thousands who lost money as a result of the failure which, had the bank been liquidated or merged in 1916 or 1918 would have been without any loss to depositors.

Technically, it is a city (see below) and with only 157 inhabitants (2010), it is one of the smallest cities in the Netherlands (after Staverden, Eembrugge and Sint Anna ter Muiden). History Early history The early history of Bronkhorst is, as is common for Dutch towns, largely unknown. It is possible that in the 7th century farmers settled on and around the hill on which a castle would be built later. The hill formed a refuge amidst the low-lying, fertile clay in the area, which is close to the river IJssel. =Lords of Bronkhorst= Bronkhorst used to be a lordship. The earliest known lord of Bronkhorst was Gijsbert of Bronkhorst (1140), son of Adam of Bronkhorst, first mentioned in 1127. He and some of his descendants played an important role in the politics of the time. The last Bronkhorst, Joost, died in 1553, after which the domain fell to the widow of Georg of Limburg. =Castle= In the Middle Ages, a castle was erected on the aforementioned hill. It is first mentioned in a 14th-century document. It consisted of a keep and associated buildings and was surrounded by a thick wall and a wide moat. It was sieged several times, most notably in 1582, when after nine months Dutch troops captured the castle, which was occupied by the Spanish. (See Eighty Years War.) The castle changed hands many times, until its last owner, a merchant, had it demolished in 1828. =Town= In a document dated 13 March 1482, Gijsbert VII granted city rights to the inhabitants of the village Bronkhorst, which was right next to the castle. Concretely this meant, among other things, that they were given limited self- government and were allowed to administer the law to some extent. Culture Bronkhorst is known for its picturesque buildings, and housed a museum dedicated to Charles Dickens which also contained items purchased from the former Dickens museum at Eastgate House in Rochester, Kent.https://www.gelderlander.nl/achterhoek/dickens-museum-uit-bronkhorst- gered-met-verhuizing-naar-braamt~ad3e001c/  Gallery  Image:Bronkhorst Windmill.JPGThe Brokhorst Windmill Image:De Bronkhorster Molen.JPGWindmill information board (in Dutch) Image:Bronkhorst 1.JPG Image:Bronkhorst 2.JPG Image:Bronkhorst 3.JPG Image:Bronkhorst 4.JPGOnderstraat 8 References See Sources.

The final plan was complete around 1985. Location Seaside is located along County Road 30A immediately adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Via County Road 30A, Rosemary Beach is 8 mi (13 km) to the southeast, and Miramar Beach is 16 mi (26 km) to the northwest (via County Road 30A to US 98).  Design  Seaside is one of three planned communities on Florida's Gulf coast designed by Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. The other two are Rosemary Beach and Alys Beach. The three are examples of a style of urban planning known as New Urbanism. As Seaside is privately owned, no other municipal governments had planning jurisdiction over Seaside, and therefore the developers were able to write their own zoning codes. Seaside's commercial hub is located at the town center. The streets are designed in a radiating street pattern with pedestrian alleys and open spaces located throughout the town. There is a mix of uses and residential types throughout the community. Individual housing units in Seaside are required to be different from other buildings, with designs ranging from styles such as Victorian, New Classical, Modern, Postmodern, and Deconstructivism. Seaside includes buildings by architects such as Léon Krier, Robert A. M. Stern, Steven Holl, Machado and Silvetti Associates, Deborah Berke, Gordon Burns & Associates, Thomas Christ, Walter Chatham, Daniel Solomon, Ronnie Holstead, Jeff Margaretten, Alex Gorlin, Aldo Rossi, Michael McDonough, Samuel Mockbee, David Mohney, Steve Badanes, Walker Candler, and David Coleman. Another Driehaus Prize winner, the architect Scott Merrill designed the Seaside Chapel, an interfaith chapel and local landmark. The Chapel at Seaside Seaside has no private front lawns, and only native plants are used in front yards. Events During the Annual 30A Songwriters Festival, produced by the Cultural Arts Association of Walton County, singer-songwriters from all over the U.S. perform in venues along Scenic Highway 30A and at a few venues in Seaside itself.Seaside, FL  More than a way of life, a way of living! The Seaside Half Marathon and 5k Race is held each year in March, and attracts runners from all across the U.S. This is quickly becoming one of the region's premier running events. The 5K Run is limited to the first 800 people that register and the Half Marathon is limited to the first 2200 that register. The top three runners from each age group receive a prize, and every runner in the half marathon receives a medal upon completing the race. Participants are allowed to walk in either race. Other events include the Seeing Red Wine Festival, a dance festival, a farmers market, and holiday events such as an annual production of The Nutcracker. Organizations and institutions = Escape to Create = Escape to Create aims to celebrate artists and serve the community through Multi-Disciplinary Artist Residencies, Visiting Artists and Scholars, Arts and Cultural Programs, and Educational outreach. =Seaside Farmers Market= On Saturday mornings the Seaside Farmers Market offers fresh local produce, dairy products, baked goods, and native plants.Seaside, FL  More than a way of life, a way of living! Demonstrations in cooking and gardening are also held on a regular basis. =Repertory Theater= The Repertory Theater (REP) was founded in the spring of 2001, and serves more than 25,000 people every year.http://lovetherep.com/about-us/ The plays are performed by the only professional theater company on the Emerald Coast, and includes everything from family shows to sophisticated adult content shows.http://lovetherep.com/calendar/ High school students who live in the area can intern at the Seaside Repertory Theater. The program is intended to teach practical knowledge by working with the staff and get to be in charge of their own production. http://lovetherep.com/mentoring/ =Seaside Institute(TM)= The Seaside Institute is a 501c3 nonprofit organization founded by Daryl and Robert Davis. Mission Statement \\"Inspiring Livable Communities\\" Through education and design by sharing visionary expertise with others throughout the world. Through strategically designed educational programs and symposia, the Institute works to inspire a future that reconnects neighbors and families, schools and merchants, children, and adults. Seaside Institute combines their three core tenets: Sustainability  Connectivity  Adaptability: Each tenet works in tandem to instill an enthusiasm for New Urbanism and Traditional Neighborhood Development in new generations of architects, future residents, visitors, and community leaders. Their goal is to provide the neighborhoods of Seaside with the connectivity that is missing today. Origins Inspired by the adult education Chautauqua movement (1884), Daryl and Robert Davis founded the Seaside Institute in 1982. Seaside Institute's hope was to nurture buildable, sustainable places through design and education, using Seaside as a backdrop and living example. The idea of developing and testing solutions for the future of quality and sustainable living became a catalyst of change in how we live. The Institute was created to bring culture to the local community, and quickly expanded its mission to include other practitioners in the fields of planning, architecture, and development. This was accomplished by inviting leaders in the fields of new urbanism to hold seminars in Seaside where participants were able to view on- the-ground examples of how town-making could be accomplished using new urbanism principles. As a result, Seaside was the inspiration behind the founding of over 220 new towns both in the United States and abroad. In its early years, the Institute produced a series of small cultural events to foster New Urban style living on the premise that a resort community that offered more than recreational activities would be a healthier and self- sustaining community over a long period. As time went on, many of the original cultural programs that were seeded by the Institute have become more fully developed and have become independent programs led by community leaders and professionals. Growth As the Institute grew and evolved, Phyliss Bleiweiss, executive director from 1999 through 2007, took the Institute to the next level and a more robust educational direction. Creating seminars in New Urbanism, she engaged leaders, who are known experts today in New Urbanism, to create an immersive education style. Learning in the birthplace of New Urbanism was immersive. Like \\"The State of the New Urbanism,\\" some symposia challenged public policy, in which planning experts discussed new, less centralized Growth Management concepts in Florida, encouraging and incentivizing local government to plan for compact, walkable towns. Tours helped architects, developers, and public officials understand the principles of a new approach to land use. One that differed from the concepts of five millennia of building towns and cities. Other symposia centered on public health, the environment, and transportation, drawing the connection between an environment where walking is rare, and epidemics like childhood and obesity and diabetes are not. Today In recent years, the mission of the Institute has morphed to become more community-focused. Seaside and the neighboring New Urban towns (Watercolor, Alys and Rosemary Beach, and more) find similar challenges within their neighborhoods. Issues that range from the communities' sustainability and the natural environment to decreasing traffic congestion and dependency on cars; and aging services and quality health care. These are the common issues the institute addresses. The Institute continues to broaden its footprint and engage the community with relevant symposia addressing aging, transportation, and sustainability. The Institute partners with key stakeholders, national and international speakers, experts in their fields to inform, educate and define solutions to issues that affect the community. =Seaside Neighborhood School= In 1995 a group of parents and other community members from towns in Walton County, met and discussed how they could improve education within the county. Their discussions focused on making a densely populated school with grades five to eight.Seaside Neighborhood School – Charter School Info In 1996 Seaside Neighborhood School was established. It was Florida's first charter school. The school initially consisted of 50 students and one classroom. In 1998, architect Richard Gibbs designed three white buildings which became the school's site.Seaside, FL  More than a way of life, a way of living! In order to maintain the small enrollment of children that attend the school, a limited number of students are accepted into each grade. If enrollment exceeds the limit, students names are drawn randomly from a lottery. After the limit has been reached, they continue to pull out names which then creates a school year waiting list. If someone withdraws from the school then the first on the waiting list will be accepted. Children of employees, Board Members, or siblings of current attendees of the school are automatically admitted. In 2013, Seaside Neighborhood School founded a collegiate high school, called Seacoast Collegiate High School. In its inaugural year, it served 80 students in grades 9 and 10. Grade 11 was added in 2014 and grade 12 was added in the fall of 2015. In August 2014, Seaside Neighborhood School also introduced a fifth grade class.Seaside Neighborhood School – Admission Policies and Procedures  Notable residents  * Don Gaetz, Florida State Senator * Matt Gaetz, Congressman for Florida See also * Rosemary Beach, Florida * Alys Beach, Florida * Celebration, Florida * Golden Oak at Walt Disney World Resort * New Urbanism References External links * The Seaside Institute website *The Seaside Research Portal by the University of Notre Dame's School of Architecture and Hesburgh Libraries Category:New Urbanism communities Category:Populated places established in 1979 Category:Unincorporated communities in Walton County, Florida Category:Unincorporated communities in Florida Category:Populated coastal places in Florida on the Gulf of Mexico Category:Planned communities in Florida Category:Beaches of Walton County, Florida Category:New Classical architecture Category:Beaches of Florida Category:1979 establishments in Florida ","title":"Seaside, Florida"},{"id":"912852","text":"Herbert Reinecker (24 December 1914 – 27 January 2007) was a very prolific German novelist, dramatist, screenwriter and former Nazi SS officer. Career Born in Hagen, Westphalia, Reinecker began to write short stories already as a high school student. In 1936 he moved to Berlin, where he became editor-in-chief of a youth magazine, Jungvolk. In the same year he also co- authored a book, Jugend in Waffen (Armed Youth). This was a time when the Nazis had already been in power for three years and when the media had long been gleichgeschaltet. In 1943 he joined the Nazi Party and worked as the editor-in-chief of a book entitled Der Pimpf about the training system of the Hitler Youth. Throughout World War II Reinecker served in a propaganda company of the Waffen SS.Hanns-Georg Rodek: Derrick und sein Schöpfer, der SS- Offizier. Die Welt, 15 September 2011. In the early 1940s Reinecker also wrote a number of plays, among them Das Dorf bei Odessa, and the novel Der Mann mit der Geige. In 1944 he wrote an award-winning screenplay, Junge Adler (Young Eagles). After the war, he started working for radio and television. At the same time he wrote screenplays for the series of German feature films of the 1960s that were loosely based on Edgar Wallace's novels as well as TV adaptations of Francis Durbridge novels and plays. In the late 1960s Reinecker and producer Helmut Ringelmann wanted to create a truly German police detective. At first tentatively conceived as a \\"German Maigret\\", Reinecker's Kommissar Keller soon metamorphosed into a full-fledged character. Erik Ode was chosen to play Keller in the TV series, Der Kommissar, which was finally launched in 1969 and which became a huge success. In 1974, Reinecker and Ringelmann started a new, similar series, Derrick. Personal life In 1938 Herbert Reinecker married Angela Schmikowski, with whom he had two children – daughter Rita (also a writer/author), 1941, and Hilmar (1944–2001). Divorced in 1954, he married Brunhilde (Holly) Schubert in 1959. Reinecker is reported to have stopped writing due to macular degeneration. He was nearly blind when he died on 27 January 2007, aged 92.

Frost Bank branch in San Antonio on the city's Northwest Side. The Frost Bank Tower is one of the tallest buildings in Austin, Texas. Frost Bank Plaza in Corpus Christi, Texas Frost Bank is a Texas-chartered bank based in San Antonio with 134 branches and 1,300 automated teller machines, all in Texas. It is the primary subsidiary of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., a bank holding company. It is on the list of largest banks in the United States. History =Early years= Frost Bank was founded in 1868 as a mercantile partnership in San Antonio by Thomas Claiborne Frost, who had served as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army. In February 1899, it was chartered as a national banking association. That year, the bank also reached $1 million in deposits. The bank survived the Panic of 1907 with the aid of an association of local banks and by 1921, sold shares to outside investors for the first time. Frost continued to grow with construction of a 12-story building in 1921, which was the tallest building in Texas at the time. By 1926, Joseph Hardin Frost, brother of T.C. Frost Jr., took over as president of the company. =Growth= Over the years, Frost has grown both organically and through acquisition of other banks, beginning in 1928 with the purchase of Lockwood National Bank.. In 1977, the company merged with Cullen Bankers, Inc. of Houston forming Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and its stock began trading on the NASDAQ. Five years later, in 1982, Cullen/Frost Bankers and United States National Bancshares, Inc. (USNB) of Galveston, Texas merged, but Frost operated USNB separately for nearly two decades. As new financial services legislation allowed banks to broaden the services they offered customers, Cullen/Frost folded the USNB charter into Frost's in 2000. With this action, the last bank using the federally forbidden United States National Bank title ceased to exist. A year later, in 1983, the bank announced it intended to merge into First City Bancorp of Houston, Texas, however the merger was never completed. First City was subsequently rescued by the FDIC in 1988 and ultimately bankrupted in 1992 and was absorbed by other banks, primarily Texas Commerce Bank (now Chase). Finishing out its first century, in 1999 Frost Bank acquired Commerce Financial Corp. and Frost Insurance Agency, a subsidiary of the bank acquired Professional Insurance Agents Inc. The first few years of the 21st century saw the grow through external acquisitions, with the purchase of Alamo Bank of Texas, Horizon Capital Bank, Summit Bancshares Inc., Texas Community Bank and Western National Bank. =Industry changes= During the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the bank did not accept government assistance via the Troubled Asset Relief Program, but faced with changes in the financial services industry, the bank converted its 113-year-old federal charter into a state charter in June 2012.

Education and career Born in Independence, Missouri to Kenneth T. and Evelyn Barwise, Jon was a precocious child. A pupil of Solomon Feferman at Stanford University, Barwise started his research in infinitary logic. After positions as assistant professor at Yale University and the University of Wisconsin, during which time his interests turned to natural language, he returned to Stanford in 1983 to direct the Center for the Study of Language and Information. He began teaching at Indiana University in 1990. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. Philosophical and logical work Barwise contended that, by being explicit about the context in which a proposition is made, the situation, many problems in the application of logic can be eliminated. He sought ... to understand meaning and inference within a general theory of information, one that takes us outside the realm of sentences and relations between sentences of any language, natural or formal. In particular, he claimed that such an approach resolved the liar paradox. He made use of Peter Aczel's non-well-founded set theory in understanding \\"vicious circles\\" of reasoning. Barwise, along with his former colleague at Stanford John Etchemendy, was the author of the popular logic textbook Language, Proof and Logic. Unlike the Handbook of Mathematical Logic, which was a survey of the state of the art of Mathematical logic c. 1975, and of which he was the editor, this work targeted elementary logic. The text is notable for including computer-aided homework problems, some of which provide visual representations of logical problems. During his time at Stanford, he was also the first Director of the Symbolic Systems Program, an interdepartmental degree program focusing on the relationships between cognition, language, logic, and computation.

A false-color image is an image that depicts an object in colors that differ from those a photograph (a true-color image) would show. In this image, colors have been assigned to three different wavelengths that our eyes cannot normally see. In addition, variants of false color such as pseudocolor, density slicing, and choropleths are used for information visualization of either data gathered by a single grayscale channel or data not depicting parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. elevation in relief maps or tissue types in magnetic resonance imaging).  Types of color renderings  = True color = The concept behind true color can help in understanding false color. An image is called a true-color image when it offers a natural color rendition, or when it comes close to it. This means that the colors of an object in an image appear to a human observer the same way as if this observer were to directly view the object: A green tree appears green in the image, a red apple red, a blue sky blue, and so on. When applied to black-and-white images, true- color means that the perceived lightness of a subject is preserved in its depiction. Endurance crater on Mars. The color is approximate true color because, instead of the red spectral band, infrared was used. The result is a metameric failure in the color of the sky, which is slightly green in the image – had a human observer been present, then that person would have perceived the actual sky color to have a bit more orange in it. The Opportunity rover which captured this image does have a red filter, but it is often not used, due to the higher scientific value of images captured using the infrared band and the constraints of data transmission. Absolute true- color rendering is impossible. There are three major sources of color error (metameric failure): * Different spectral sensitivities of the human eye and of an image capture device (e.g. a camera). * Different spectral emissions / reflections of the object and of the image render process (e.g. a printer or monitor). * Differences in spectral irradiance in the case of reflective images (e.g. photo prints) or reflective objects – see color rendering index (CRI) for details. The result of a metameric failure would be for example an image of a green tree which shows a different shade of green than the tree itself, a different shade of red for a red apple, a different shade of blue for the blue sky, and so on. Color management (e.g. with ICC profiles) can be used to mitigate this problem within the physical constraints. Approximate true-color images gathered by spacecraft are an example where images have a certain amount of metameric failure, as the spectral bands of a spacecraft's camera are chosen to gather information on the physical properties of the object under investigation, and are not chosen to capture true-color images. = False color = A traditional false-color satellite image of Las Vegas. Grass-covered land (e.g. a golf course) appears in red. In contrast to a true- color image, a false-color image sacrifices natural color rendition in order to ease the detection of features that are not readily discernible otherwise – for example the use of near infrared for the detection of vegetation in satellite images. While a false-color image can be created using solely the visual spectrum (e.g. to accentuate color differences), typically some or all data used is from electromagnetic radiation (EM) outside the visual spectrum (e.g. infrared, ultraviolet or X-ray). The choice of spectral bands is governed by the physical properties of the object under investigation. As the human eye uses three spectral bands (see trichromacy for details), three spectral bands are commonly combined into a false-color image. At least two spectral bands are needed for a false-color encoding, and it is possible to combine more bands into the three visual RGB bands – with the eye's ability to discern three channels being the limiting factor. In contrast, a \\"color\\" image made from one spectral band, or an image made from data consisting of non-EM data (e.g. elevation, temperature, tissue type) is a pseudocolor image (see below). For true color, the RGB channels (red \\"R\\", green \\"G\\" and blue \\"B\\") from the camera are mapped to the corresponding RGB channels of the image, yielding a \\"RGB→RGB\\" mapping. For false color this relationship is changed. The simplest false-color encoding is to take an RGB image in the visible spectrum, but map it differently, e.g. \\"GBR→RGB\\". For traditional false-color satellite images of Earth a \\"NRG→RGB\\" mapping is used, with \\"N\\" being the near-infrared spectral band (and the blue spectral band being unused) – this yields the typical \\"vegetation in red\\" false-color images. False color is used (among others) for satellite and space images: Examples are remote sensing satellites (e.g. Landsat, see example above), space telescopes (e.g. the Hubble Space Telescope) or space probes (e.g. Cassini-Huygens). Some spacecraft, with rovers (e.g. the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity) being the most prominent examples, have the ability to capture approximate true-color images as well. Weather satellites produce, in contrast to the spacecrafts mentioned previously, grayscale images from the visible or infrared spectrum. =Pseudocolor= A pseudocolor image (sometimes styled pseudo-color or pseudo color) is derived from a grayscale image by mapping each intensity value to a color according to a table or function. Pseudo color is typically used when a single channel of data is available (e.g. temperature, elevation, soil composition, tissue type, and so on), in contrast to false color which is commonly used to display three channels of data. Pseudocoloring can make some details more visible, as the perceived difference in color space is bigger than between successive gray levels alone. On the other hand, the color mapping function should be chosen to make sure the lightness of the color is still monotonic, or the uneven change would make it hard to interpret levels, for both normal and colorblind viewers. One offender is the commonly-used \\"rainbow\\" palette, with a back-and-forth change in lightness. (See also .) A typical example for the use of pseudo color is thermography (thermal imaging), where infrared cameras feature only one spectral band and show their grayscale images in pseudo color. Another familiar example of pseudo color is the encoding of elevation using hypsometric tints in physical relief maps, where negative values (below sea level) are usually represented by shades of blue, and positive values by greens and browns. Depending on the table or function used and the choice of data sources, pseudocoloring may increase the information contents of the original image, for example adding geographic information, combining information obtained from infrared or ultra-violet light, or other sources like MRI scans. A further application of pseudocoloring is to store the results of image elaboration; that is, changing the colors in order to ease understanding an image. =Density slicing= An image of Tasmania and surrounding waters using density slicing to show phytoplankton concentration. The ocean color as captured by the satellite image is mapped to seven colors: Yellow, orange and red indicate more phytoplankton, while light green, dark green, light blue and dark blue indicate less phytoplankton; land and clouds are depicted in different colors. Density slicing, a variation of pseudo color, divides an image into a few colored bands and is (among others) used in the analysis of remote sensing images. For density slicing the range of grayscale levels is divided into intervals, with each interval assigned to one of a few discrete colors – this is in contrast to pseudo color, which uses a continuous color scale.J. B. Campbell, \\"Introduction to Remote Sensing\\", 3rd ed., Taylor & Francis, p. 153 For example, in a grayscale thermal image the temperature values in the image can be split into bands of 2 °C, and each band represented by one color – as a result the temperature of one spot in the thermograph can be easier acquired by the user, because the discernible differences between the discrete colors are greater than those of images with continuous grayscale or continuous pseudo color. =Choropleth= US Presidential Election of 2004, visualised using a choropleth map. The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are traditionally assigned redder and bluer colors, respectively. A choropleth is an image or map in which areas are colored or patterned proportionally to the category or value of one or more variables being represented. The variables are mapped to a few colors; each area contributes one data point and receives one color from these selected colors. Basically it is density slicing applied to a pseudocolor overlay. A choropleth map of a geographic area is thus an extreme form of false color. False color in the arts While artistic rendition lends to subjective expression of color, Andy Warhol (1928–1987) has become a culturally significant figure of the modern art movement by creating false color paintings with screen printing techniques. Some of Warhol's most recognizable prints include a replication of Marilyn Monroe, her image based on a film frame from the movie Niagara. The subject was a sex symbol and film noir starlet whose death in 1962 influenced the artist. A series of prints were made with endearment but expose her persona as an illusion through his assembly line style of art production which are non- erotic and slightly grotesque. Using various ink color palettes, Warhol immersed himself in a process of repetition that serves to compare personas and everyday objects to the qualities of mass production and consumerism. The colors of ink were selected through experimentation of aesthetics and do not correlate to false color rendering of the electromagnetic spectrum employed in remote sensing image processing. For years the artist continued screen printing false color images of Marilyn Monroe, perhaps his most referenced work being Turquoise Marilyn which was bought in May 2007 by a private collector for 80 million US dollars.

History Founded in 1873 as the Imperial Bank in Toronto by Henry Stark Howland, former vice president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. The bank became the Imperial Bank of Canada in 1874. In 1875, the president of the Imperial Bank of Canada was H.S. Howland, founder of the original Imperial Bank. The bank had a capital of $1,000,000 and the head office was located on Wellington Street in Toronto, Ontario. The Imperial Bank of Canada branches expanded beyond Toronto and were found in St. Catharines, Ingersoll, Welland, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and Port Colborne.http://digitalcollections.torontopubliclibrary.ca/webDC/images.do?contentID=PICTURES-R-1445 Imperial Bank of Canada 1875 In 1875, it amalgamated with the Niagara District Bank, which had been chartered on May 19, 1855, in Montreal.

Life and career Cohn was born to a working-class Jewish family in New York City.Actors Directors from Germany, Austria, Switzerland – German-Hollywood Connection His father, Joseph Cohen, was a tailor from Germany, and his mother, Bella Joseph, was from Pale of Settlement, Russian Empire. After working for a time as a streetcar conductor, and then as a song plugger for a sheet music printer, he got a job with Universal Pictures, where his brother, Jack Cohn, was already employed. In 1919, Cohn joined his brother and Joe Brandt to found CBC Film Sales Corporation. The initials officially stood for Cohn, Brandt, and Cohn, but Hollywood wags noted the company's low- budget, low-class efforts and nicknamed CBC \\"Corned Beef and Cabbage.\\" Harry Cohn managed the company's film production in Hollywood, while his brother managed its finances from New York. The relationship between the two brothers was not always good, and Brandt, finding the partnership stressful, eventually sold his third of the company to Harry Cohn, who took over as president, by which time the firm had been renamed Columbia Pictures Corporation. Most of Columbia's early work was action fare starring rock-jawed leading man Jack Holt. Columbia was unable to shake off its stigma as a Poverty Row studio until 1934, when director Frank Capra's Columbia comedy It Happened One Night swept the Academy Awards. Exhibitors who formerly wouldn't touch Columbia product became steady customers. As a horizontally integrated company that only controlled production and distribution, Columbia had been at the mercy of theater owners. Columbia expanded its scope to offer moviegoers a regular program of economically made features, short subjects, serials, travelogues, sports reels, and cartoons. Columbia released a few \\"class\\" productions each year (Lost Horizon, Holiday, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,The Jolson Story, Gilda, All the King's Men, etc.), but depended on its popular \\"budget\\" productions to keep the company solvent. During Cohn's tenure, the studio always turned a profit. Cohn did not build a stable of movie stars like other studios. Instead, he generally signed actors who usually worked for more expensive studios (Wheeler & Woolsey, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Mae West, Humphrey Bogart, Dorothy Lamour, Mickey Rooney, Chester Morris, Warren William, Warner Baxter, Sabu, Gloria Jean, Margaret O'Brien, etc.) to attract a pre-sold audience. Columbia's own stars generally rose from the ranks of small-part actors and featured players (Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Larry Parks, Julie Bishop, Lloyd Bridges, Bruce Bennett, Jock Mahoney, etc.). Some of Columbia's producers and directors also graduated from lesser positions as actors, writers, musicians, and assistant directors. Cohn was known for his autocratic and intimidating management style. When he took over as Columbia's president, he remained production chief as well, thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He respected talent above any personal attribute, but he made sure his employees knew who was boss. Writer Ben Hecht referred to him as \\"White Fang.\\" An employee of Columbia called him \\"as absolute a monarch as Hollywood ever knew.\\" It was said \\"he had listening devices on all sound stages and could tune in any conversation on the set, then boom in over a loudspeaker if he heard anything that displeased him.\\" Throughout his tenure, his most popular moniker was \\"King Cohn.\\" Moe Howard of the Three Stooges recalled that Cohn was \\"a real Jekyll-and-Hyde-type guy... socially, he could be very charming.\\" Cohn was known to scream and curse at actors and directors in his office all afternoon, and greet them cordially at a dinner party that evening. There is some suggestion that Cohn deliberately cultivated his reputation as a tyrant, either to motivate his employees or simply because it increased his control of the studio. Cohn is said to have kept a signed photograph of Benito Mussolini, whom he met in Italy in 1933, on his desk until the beginning of World War II. (Columbia produced the documentary Mussolini Speaks in 1933, narrated by Lowell Thomas). Cohn also had a number of ties to organized crime. He had a long-standing friendship with Chicago mobster John Roselli, and New Jersey mob boss Abner Zwillman was the source of the loan that allowed Cohn to buy out his partner Brandt. Cohn's brash, loud, intimidating style has become Hollywood legend and was reportedly portrayed in various movies. The characters played by Broderick Crawford in All The King's Men (1949) and Born Yesterday (1950), both Columbia pictures, are allegedly based on Cohn, as is Jack Woltz, a movie mogul who appears in The Godfather (1972). In his own way, Harry Cohn was sentimental about certain professional matters. He remembered the valuable contributions of Jack Holt during Columbia's struggling years, and kept him under contract until 1941. Cohn hired the Three Stooges in 1934 and, according to Stooge Larry Fine, \\"he thought we brought him luck.\\" Cohn kept the Stooges on his payroll until the end of 1957. Cohn was fond of what he termed \\"those lousy little 'B' pictures,\\" and kept making them, along with two-reel comedies and serials, after other studios had abandoned them. According to biographer Michael Fleming, Cohn forced Curly Howard of the Stooges to keep working after suffering a series of minor strokes, which likely contributed to a further deterioration of Howard's health and his eventual retirement and early death. Personal life Cohn expected, or at least asked for, sex from female stars in exchange for employment (although similar stories were connected to many producers in Hollywood at the time). Harry Cohn's relationship with Rita Hayworth was fraught with aggravation. Hayworth's biography If This Was Happiness, describes how she refused to sleep with Cohn and how this angered him. However, because Hayworth was such a valuable property Cohn kept her under contract because she made money for him. During the years they worked together, each did their best to irritate the other despite their lengthy work relationship which produced good results. Cohn wanted to groom Mary Castle as Hayworth's successor. When Joan Crawford was subjected to Cohn's advances after signing a three-picture contract with Columbia, she quickly stopped him by saying \\"Keep it in your pants, Harry. I'm having lunch with Joan and the boys [Cohn's wife and children] tomorrow.\\" According to writer Joseph McBride, Jean Arthur quit the business because Cohn used to attack actresses.http://www.danspapers.com/2017/12/danny-peary-two-cheers-for- hollywood-joseph-mcbride/ In a BBC documentary, Sammy Davis Jr - The Kid in the Middle, along with the titular star's episode of TVOne's Unsung Hollywood, it was disclosed that Cohn, in order to end Kim Novak's relationship with a black man, had mobsters threaten Sammy Davis, Jr. with blinding or having his legs broken if he did not marry a black woman within 48 hours. Cohn was married to Rose Barker from 1923 to 1941, and to actress Joan Perry (1911–1996) from July 1941 until his death in 1958. His niece was Leonore \\"Lee\\" Cohn Annenberg, the wife of billionaire publishing magnate Walter Annenberg of Philadelphia. Her father was Maxwell Cohn, brother of Harry and Jack Cohn. Death Cohn suffered a sudden heart attack in February 1958 at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, shortly after having finished dinner, and died in an ambulance en route to St. Joseph's Hospital. Cohn's well-attended funeral was the subject of the famous (perhaps apocryphal) quote attributed to Red Skelton: \\"It proves what Harry always said: Give the public what they want and they'll come out for it.\\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/12/06/want/.

On February 1, 1955, it merged with the Bank of Toronto to form the Toronto-Dominion Bank. History Dominion Bank branch in Montreal, circa 1915. Consolidated statement of the bank for the year 1942. In 1871, the Dominion Bank was launched by entrepreneurs and professionals under the leadership of James Austin with the opening of its first branch on King Street in Toronto, Ontario. They were dedicated to creating a new institution “conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country.” The Dominion Bank was a cautious institution, “selecting its customers carefully, serving them well, and duly prospering with them” (in the words of the official history). It too created a network of branches, and in 1872 became the first Canadian bank to have two branches in one city – Toronto. With the maturing of the Canadian economy and the opening of northern Ontario and the West in 1880s and 1890s, the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries, utilities, and manufacturing. In 1897, the Dominion Bank opened its first western branch in Winnipeg. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the bank rapidly expanded their branch networks in central Canada and across the west. To mark its rise as a significant national institution, the Dominion Bank moved to a landmark head office at King and Yonge Street in 1879. The First World War brought new challenges for the bank when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public. Half the staff of the bank served in the armed forces. Except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought, the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion. Both banks weathered the storm of Great Depression in the 1930s without great difficulty, despite a decline in earnings. Like all Canadian banks, they endured criticism of its credit policies and resisted the introduction of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy. Ultimately the Bank of Canada was established and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency. The coming of the Second World War involved the banks, once again, in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange, rationing, and other financial war measures. Approximately 500 staff, or almost half the total, entered the armed forces. The Dominion Bank emerged from the war in 1945 stronger than ever, with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post-war boom, they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. The bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place it in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the post-war economy. Amalgamation In 1954, negotiations began between the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank, and by the end of the year, an amalgamation agreement was reached. In their brief to the Minister of Finance, the banks stated: “It is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank, with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger banks.” On November 1, 1954, Canada's minister of finance announced that the amalgamation was accepted, and shareholders were asked for their approval. This was forthcoming in December, and on February 1, 1955, the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank became the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

History Bell Tower in Edmonton The Canadian Commercial Bank officially began operations in July 1976, with CDN$22 million of capital. From 1976-1982, it operated profitably—usually in the top quartile of Canadian banking. It built a new headquarters in Edmonton, the Canadian Commercial Bank Tower in 1982. In early 1985, after investing heavily in real estate and energy sector companies, the bank became insolvent during a period of rising interest rates and a falling Canadian dollar. The federal government arranged a $255 million bailout ($ billion today) in an effort to keep the failing institution afloat. In spite of this, the bank ceased operations on September 3, 1985. It was the largest bank failure in Canadian history and the first in Canada in 60 years, though followed shortly that year by the failure of the Northland Bank. Following the failures, the government weathered calls for the resignation of the governor of the Central Bank, Gerald Bouey.

The Canadian Bank of Commerce was founded the following year, issued stock, and opened its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. The bank soon opened branches in London, St. Catharines and Barrie. During the following years, the bank opened more branches in Ontario, and took over the business of the local Gore Bank, before expanding across Canada through the acquisition of the Bank of British Columbia in 1901 and the Halifax Banking Company in 1903. By 1907 the Canadian Bank of Commerce had 172 branches.

Control valves normally respond to signals generated by independent devices such as flow meters or temperature gauges. Operation Globe control valve with the pneumatic actuator and smart positioner. The loop current and stem travel are displayed. Control valves are normally fitted with actuators and positioners. Pneumatically-actuated globe valves and diaphragm valves are widely used for control purposes in many industries, although quarter-turn types such as (modified) ball and butterfly valves are also used. Control valves can also work with hydraulic actuators (also known as hydraulic pilots). These types of valves are also known as automatic control valves. The hydraulic actuators respond to changes of pressure or flow and will open/close the valve. Automatic control valves do not require an external power source, meaning that the fluid pressure is enough to open and close them. Automatic control valves include pressure reducing valves, flow control valves, back-pressure sustaining valves, altitude valves, and relief valves. Application Example of current loops used for sensing and control. Specific example of a smart valve positioner used.Process plants consist of hundreds, or even thousands, of control loops all networked together to produce a product to be offered for sale. Each of these control loops is designed to keep some important process variable, such as pressure, flow, level, or temperature, within a required operating range to ensure the quality of the end product. Each loop receives and internally creates disturbances that detrimentally affect the process variable, and interaction from other loops in the network provides disturbances that influence the process variable.Fisher - Control Valve Handbook, Fourth Edition, Fisher Controls International, 2005 To reduce the effect of these load disturbances, sensors and transmitters collect information about the process variable and its relationship to some desired set point. A controller then processes this information and decides what must be done to get the process variable back to where it should be after a load disturbance occurs. When all the measuring, comparing, and calculating are done, some type of final control element must implement the strategy selected by the controller. The most common final control element in the process control industries is the control valve. The control valve manipulates a flowing fluid, such as gas, steam, water, or chemical compounds, to compensate for the load disturbance and keep the regulated process variable as close as possible to the desired set point.

On February 1, 1955, it merged with The Dominion Bank to form the Toronto-Dominion Bank. Its first president was James Grant Chewett. History In July 1856, the Bank of Toronto opened its offices at 78 Church Street, Toronto, with a staff of three and immediately began development of a provincial network of branches. Thomas Clarkson, a major participant in the growing Toronto commerce, served as one of the first directors from 1856 through to 1858, steering the Bank through the depression of 1857. In 1860, it opened its first branch outside of Ontario (then as Canada West), in Montreal, Canada East. The Bank of Toronto established itself as an efficient, profitable, but essentially conservative bank through the 19th century. It maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in Canada. Growth was very slow and deliberate, with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres. Core customers remained farmers, merchants, and processors of farm products (millers, brewers, distillers). With the maturing of the Canadian economy and the opening of northern Ontario and the West in the 1880s and 1890s, the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries, utilities, and manufacturing. In 1899, the Bank of Toronto opened a branch in the British Columbia mining town of Rossland. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the banks rapidly expanded their branch networks in central Canada and across the west. To mark their rise as significant national institutions, the Bank of Toronto moved into a large new head office building at the corner of King and Bay Streets in Toronto in 1913. World War I brought new challenges for the two banks when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public. Half of the staff of the two banks served in the armed forces. 1922 newspaper ad for the bank, promoting services to farmers. Except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought, the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion. The bank weathered the storm of depression in the 1930s without great difficulty, despite a decline in earnings. Like all Canadian banks, they endured criticism of its credit policies and resisted the introduction of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy. Ultimately the Bank of Canada was established and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency. The coming of the Second World War involved the banks, once again, in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange, rationing, and other financial war measures. Approximately 500 staff, or almost half the total, entered the armed forces. The Bank of Toronto emerged from the war in 1945 stronger than ever, with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post- war boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. Neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the post- war economy. Architecture The Bank of Toronto in Winnipeg, Manitoba erected in 1905-06 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto at 205 Yonge Street in Toronto, Ontario built in 1905 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto Building in Victoria, British Columbia built in 1951 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto Building in Chaplin, Saskatchewan built in 1915 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto Vault in Turtle Mountain, Manitoba, completed in 1919, is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. Andrew Taylor designed the Bank of Toronto at St. James Street & McGill Street, which was erected in 1893-94. Amalgamation In 1954, negotiations began between the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank, and by the end of the year, an amalgamation agreement was reached. In their brief to the Minister of Finance, the banks stated: \\"It is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank, with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger banks.\\" On November 1, 1954, Canada's minister of finance announced that the amalgamation was accepted and shareholders were asked for their approval. This was forthcoming in December and on February 1, 1955, the Bank of Toronto and The Dominion Bank became the Toronto-Dominion Bank. The building at 78 Church Street was listed on the City of Toronto Heritage Property Inventory on August 14, 1991, in hopes of preserving some of its historical physical attributes.

The Bank of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, was built in 1889 to 1891 and was added to Vancouver's Community Heritage Register in 1986. The second bank: 1966–1986 The second bank was chartered in 1966 with headquarters in Vancouver and was the creation of W.A.C. Bennett, the Premier of British Columbia. Bennett, a businessman, wanted to end Central Canada's control over the banking industry which obliged all but the smaller loans for companies in British Columbia to receive authorization from head offices in either Montreal or Toronto. In 1986, the bank had 1,410 employees, 41 branches in BC and Alberta, and offices in the Cayman Islands, the US, and Hong Kong. Assets in 1986 were CAD$2.7 billion, which put the bank 27th among banks and financial institutions in Canada. Revenue in 1986 was $324 million. Following financial difficulties arising from the decline of the western oil economy, the collapses of Canadian Commercial Bank and Northland Bank had a serious impact on other institutions that depended on wholesale deposit funding. Like the many Trust Companies and Credit Union amalgamations in 1986, the Canadian government permitted the Hongkong Bank of Canada (HSBC) to rescue it.Patricia Chisholm, End of a dream for Bank of B.C. Financial Times of Canada, December 1, 1986, pp. 8, 59. By stepping in, HSBC acquired a large base of stable retail deposits. The acquisition immediately raised HSBC's ranking amongst Canadian banks from the 20th to the 9th largest.

He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015 as Member of Parliament (MP) for Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Early life and career Vellacott was born to a family in Wadena, Saskatchewan, and was raised in Quill Lake.Peter Wilson, \\"Rookie MP learns to live in Ottawa\\", Saskatoon Star- Phoenix, 1 November 1997, C1. He obtained a Bachelor's degree from Briercrest College, a Christian educational institution located in Caronport, Saskatchewan, and later earned a Master of Divinity at the Canadian Theological Seminary (affiliated with the University of Regina) and a Doctor of Ministry from Trinity International University, which is an evangelical Christian university in Deerfield, Illinois. Before entering political life, he was a pastor and personal care worker at a nursing home in Rosthern, Saskatchewan.Official Maurice Vellacott website , \\"About Maurice\\" (accessed 27 March 2006). He joined the Reform Party of Canada in 1990.Alex Postnikoff, \\"Vellacott's changes confusing voters\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 2 April 2004, A10. Vellacott campaigned in the 1995 Saskatchewan provincial election as a Liberal, and lost to New Democratic Party candidate Eric Cline in Saskatoon Mount Royal. He later argued that running as a Liberal was consistent with his political ideology, in that the provincial Liberal platform of 1995 contained several policies advocated by the Reform Party, which did not have provincial affiliates.Maurice Vellacott, \\"Political views consistent throughout career\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 21 April 2004, A12. Vellacott was elected for Ward Two on the Saskatoon District Health Board in 1995, and served on the board for two years before his election to the House of Commons. He wrote an editorial piece about Canada's health care system in 1996, defending the public model as far superior to the \\"fragmented\\" American system in combating administrative waste, but also arguing that the system was in need of renewal and an infusion of funds. Vellacott suggested that Saskatoon District Health could impose a surcharge on American health insurers for certain medical procedures given to American patients, \\"and in the process make money to inject back into the public system for the people of Saskatchewan.\\"Maurice Vellacott, \\"Creative thinking key to keeping health services\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 8 August 1996, A5. In early 1997, Vellacott opposed a request by Saskatoon's Gay and Lesbian Health Services (GLHS) for health board funding. Gens Hellquist of GLHS had argued that homophobic intolerance was responsible for higher levels of depression in the LGBT community in relation to society as a whole, and that community-specific funding would address these and other concerns. Vellacott responded by suggesting that many homosexuals were inappropriately blaming their personal difficulties on homophobia.Betty Ann Adam, \\"[Saskatoon health district needs ...], Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 7 February 1997, A7. Vellacott called for the removal of video lottery terminals from the city, blaming them for an increase in health costs related to gambling addiction.Betty Ann Adam, \\"Increased attendance at Gambler's Anonymous linked to VLTs\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 7 March 1997, A1. His motion for a plebiscite was defeated in May 1997.Dan Zakreski, \\"Health board rejects Saskatoon VLT vote\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 3 May 1997, A5. Vellacott is a social and economic conservative. His community involvement in the past and present has included the Canadian Club, Canadian Palliative Care, the Saskatchewan Pro-Life Association, the Saskatchewan Landlords Association, the Saskatchewan Taxpayers Federation, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, the Chamber of Commerce, the North Saskatoon Business Association and Toastmasters International. He is a founding Board Member of Real Choices Crisis Pregnancy Centre in Saskatoon. In Parliament, he has been a member of the Reform Party's Family Cauucs and a co-chair of the non-partisan Parliamentary Pro-Life Caucus. Reform MP In early 1997, Vellacott defeated Sam Dyck and Fred Wesolowski to win the Reform Party's nomination for Wanuskewin. Dyck later ran as an independent candidate against Vellacott in the 1997 federal election, arguing that Vellacott would try to \\"legislate morality\\" if victorious.Lyons, \\"Disgruntled Reformer\\". Vellacott was nonetheless elected, amid a general gain for Reform in Saskatchewan. The Liberal Party won a majority government, and Vellacott served as a member of the Official Opposition. Shortly after his election, Vellacott announced that he would introduce a Private Member's Bill to eliminate the national Court Challenges Program, which provides funding for groups that bring human rights cases before the Canadian courts. He argued that \\"some zealots\\" were \\"using our important tax dollars\\" for dubious ends via the program, and singled out an effort by Saskatoon resident Ailsa Watkinson to prohibit corporal punishment against children.Jason Warick, \\"Vellacott wants to end federal program that will pay for woman's battle against corporal punishment\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 24 December 1997, A1. Vellacott wrote an editorial piece in early 1998 describing Watkinson as a \\"social engineer\\" promoting an \\"extremist agenda\\", and accusing Canada's \\"unelected judges\\" of \\"judicial imperialism\\" in their interpretations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Maurice Vellacott, \\"Courts wrong venue to settle spanking issue\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 22 January 1998, A5. A supporter of Watkinson responded that Vellacott's piece was a \\"mixture of invective and innuendo\\", and argued that his defence of corporal punishment was based on flawed logic.Carol Schick, \\"Vellacott gets facts skewed\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 5 February 1998, A5. A Conservative Party government withdrew funding for the Court Challenges Program in 2006. Vellacott supported other socially conservative initiatives. In late 1998, he brought forward a \\"conscience rights\\" bill to prevent nurses and doctors from being forced to perform abortions.\\"Anti-abortionists march in Ottawa\\", Calgary Herald, 15 May 1999, A14. He wrote an editorial against same-sex marriage the following year, arguing that marriage should be restricted to heterosexual couples because of its traditional role in the procreation and nurturing of children. He wrote that \\"homosexuals already have the right to marry, providing that -- like everybody else -- they marry someone of the opposite sex\\".Maurice Vellacott, \\"Same-sex marriages add to drain on treasury\\", Calgary Herald, 20 May 1999, A37. He opposed granting spousal benefits for same-sex couples, describing supporters of the initiative as \\"activist liberal judges and a small but aggressive homosexual lobby\\".Maurice Vellacott, \\"Still enough time to let MPs know Bill C-23 unpopular\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 22 March 2000, A10. In 1999, he criticized the Saskatchewan government's decision to force thirteen- year-old Tyrell Dueck into cancer treatment. Dueck's parents objected to continued cancer treatment at the Saskatoon cancer centre on the grounds that it did not appear to be working, and instead sought to access a more experimental treatment in Mexico. Vellacott supported parental discretion in such matters.Betty Ann Adam, \\"Protesters lend support to Duecks\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 23 March 1999, A1. Dueck subsequently died, and many blamed his parents' decision not to accept treatment in Saskatchewan. Vellacott also called for full compensation to Hepatitis C victims during his first term in Parliament, arguing that the government could overcome complicated legal issues around liability by issuing ex gratia payments.Rosemary Spiers, \\"National Affairs\\", Victoria Times-Colonist, 28 April 1998, p. 1. Vellacott confirmed his support for Preston Manning's leadership of the Reform Party in 1998, after two other Saskatchewan Reform MPs called for a leadership review.Mark Wyatt and Murray Mandryk, \\"Reform MPs at odds over leadership vote\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 18 August 1998, A6. He originally voted against the 1999 United Alternative initiative which led to the creation of the Canadian Alliance, but later changed his mind and supported it.Joan Bryden, \\"Two more Reform MPs join chorus of UA dissenters\\", Ottawa Citizen, 6 April 1999, A9. In March 2000, he became the first Reform MP to endorse Stockwell Day's ultimately successful bid for the Canadian Alliance leadership.James Parker, \\"Day's the man, say Sask. MPs\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 10 May 2000, A5. Vellacott's endorsement came minutes after Day declared his candidacy. Vellacott said that he supported Day's \\"respect for life and his recognition of the family as the basic building block of society\\".Justine Hunter, \\"Day dares to mix volatile cocktail of social values, politics\\", National Post, 16 May 2000, A6. He also defended the socially conservative Campaign Life Coalition during the campaign, after that organization was criticized for drawing attention to homosexual supporters of rival candidate Tom Long.Robert Fife, \\"Canadian Alliance MP says it's OK for gays to work on campaigns - just don't give them special status\\", National Post, 26 May 2000, A7. Canadian Alliance MP Vellacott was re-elected by an increased majority in the 2000 election, as a candidate of the Canadian Alliance. In January 2001, he argued that Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson had abused her office by sending a \\"best wishes\\" message to a newly married same-sex couple in Toronto, Ontario. Clarkson's office responded that the letter was a personal courtesy, and was not a political statement.\\"Clarkson's message was polite, not politics: Office\\", Toronto Star, 16 January 2001, 02. Stockwell Day's leadership of the Canadian Alliance came under increased scrutiny in the summer of 2001, and several MPs called for his resignation. Vellacott remained a Day supporter, and described the critics as \\"backstabbers, hijackers (and) guerrillas\\".Darren Bernhardt, \\"Vellacott attacks \`guerrillas' for sabotage attempt on Day\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 10 July 2001, A1. Day resigned late in the year, and declared that he would campaign to succeed himself in the following leadership contest. Vellacott again supported his candidacy.Tim Harper, \\"Day appeals to grassroots as he launches comeback bid\\", Toronto Star, 8 January 2002, A06. Supporters of rival candidate Stephen Harper criticized Vellacott for mailing out endorsements of Day through his constituency office, at public expense.James Parker, \\"Sask. MPs join attack on Vellacott mailouts\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 5 March 2002, A4. Harper won the contest. Vellacott continued to support socially conservative causes as a Canadian Alliance MP, and was a vocal opponent of embryonic stem-cell research in 2002, although he supports adult stem cell research.Norma Greenway, \\"Anti-abortion forces rally to fight bill allowing stem cell research\\", Times-Colonist, 11 May 2002, A6. In the same year, he mailed out a controversial pamphlet opposing the addition of sexual orientation as a protected category under Canada's hate crimes legislation. Vellacott claimed the policy change \\"substantially interferes with the right of religious and education leaders to communicate essential matters of faith\\".Thomas Knutson, \\"MP proves need for law he opposes\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 6 December 2002, A19. Also in 2002, Vellacott was the only MP to speak against a parliamentary motion recognizing an Armenian genocide as having occurred in 1915. He was quoted as saying: :What the Turks so strenuously object to is the Armenian activists' one-sided portrayal of the tragic events to the world community and labelling them as genocide, using, in some cases, distortion or exaggeration of facts to further their political agenda of obtaining money and land from Turkey. While doing so, Armenians ignore the death and massacre of more than twice as many Turks at the hands of the Armenian revolutionary bands and the Russians whom they were helping during the First World War.Bora Hincer, \\"Armenian 'genocide': Rewriting history for political gain\\", Kingston Whig-Standard, 6 June 2002, p. 8. His comments were commended by some Turkish-Canadian groups, and criticized by some Armenian-Canadians.Albert Kaprelian, \\"Those who deny genocide are real rewriters of history\\", Kingston Whig-Standard, 13 June 2002, p. 6. The Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 2003–04 to create the Conservative Party of Canada. Vellacott supported the merger, and endorsed Stephen Harper's successful campaign for the new party's leadership.Sean Gordon and Tom Blackwell, \\"Alliance votes 96% to unite right\\", Ottawa Citizen, 6 December 2003, A3. Conservative MP Vellacott won the Conservative nomination for Saskatoon—Wanuskewin in early 2004, defeating former Progressive Conservative Nick Bakker with 85% support.\\"Vellacott wins nomination\\", Saskatoon Leader-Post, 21 February 2004, A2. He faced a difficult challenge in the 2004 federal election from Chris Axworthy, a former federal New Democratic Party (NDP) MP and provincial NDP cabinet minister now running for the Liberals. Vellacott was returned with a reduced majority, as the Liberals won a minority government nationally. After the election, Vellacott called for the trial of Saskatoon police officers Ken Munson and Dan Hatchen to be reopened. Munson and Hatchen had been convicted of abandoning an aboriginal man near a power station during freezing weather (the man in question did not suffer any injury). Vellacott said new evidence had been found, indicating that the officers dropped the man off within a short walking distance of where he told the officers he lived.\\"MP raps police conviction\\", Windsor Star, 12 August 2004, B7. He later established a defence fund for the officers.Darren Bernhardt, \\"Vellacott establishes defence fund for ex-cops\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 27 August 2004, A1. The case was not re-opened. When the Saskatchewan judicial system approved same-sex marriages in 2004, Vellacott said it was \\"unfortunate that the Saskatchewan court has followed in the activist footsteps of other courts in this country\\".Jason Warick, \\"Saskatchewan judge lifts gay-marriage ban\\", Time-Colonist, 6 November 2004, A8. He later argued that marriage commissioners should have \\"conscience rights\\" to refuse to marry same-sex couples.Julie Saccone, \\"Marriage commissioner files complaint\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 29 January 2005, A4. During a 2005 rally, he said, \\"there is no such thing as a right to same-sex marriage\\".Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"Thousands rally for marriage: Gay couples 'don't have capacity to reproduce'\\", Vancouver Province, 24 May 2005, A15. Also in 2005, Vellacott called for legislation making it illegal to harm or kill the unborn children of mothers not planning to have abortions (such that killing a pregnant woman would constitute a double-murder).Lana Haight, \\"MP wants law protecting unborn from crime\\", Regina Leader Post, 22 July 2005, A4. The suggestion won support from some, while others argued that it could eventually lead to restrictions on abortion. When Belinda Stronach crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberals in mid-2005, Vellacott suggested that she was prostituting herself for power and had \\"sold out for a cabinet position\\".Tim Naumetz, \\"Harper joins chorus of Tories with harsh words for Stronach\\", Ottawa Citizen, 18 May 2005, A4. Some criticized this as sexist, and Vellacott issued a \\"statement of regret\\" for his choice of words.Stephanie Classen, \\"Conservative MP offers 'regret' for comments about Stronach\\", Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, 24 May 2005, A4. Vellacott was re-elected over Chris Axworthy a second time in the 2006 federal election, in a contest that was marked by extreme bitterness and controversy. During a live televised debate late in the campaign, a caller falsely suggested that Vellacott had been forced to leave North Park Church in Saskatoon after being accused of sexual assault on a church secretary. The call was subsequently traced to Axworthy's campaign headquarters. Axworthy described the allegations as \\"deplorable\\", and apologized to Vellacott for the situation. He denied that anyone in his office was put up to making the call, and suggested that a \\"mischief-maker\\" may have entered the office.Julie Saccone, \\"Tory MP outraged at sex assault allegation\\", Vancouver Sun, 20 January 2006, A5. Former long-term pastor Jerold Gliege indicated that Vellacott never served at or attended the church in question, which has been defunct since 1979. Vellacott's campaign later produced an affidavit from Saskatchewan politician Tom Hengen, in which he \\"to the best of [his] knowledge and belief\\" named Axworthy campaign worker George Laliberte as the caller.Tom Hengen, affidavit, 20 January 2006. Axworthy spoke to Laliberte, and reported that he vehemently denied making the call.Lori Coolican, \\"Dump candidate over false accusations\\", National Post, 21 January 2006, A5. Vellacott's lawyer later filed a defamation suit against Laliberte on March 22, 2006, in the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Vellacott won the lawsuit and was awarded $5000 in damages. The national Conservative campaign accused the Liberals of a coverup, and called for Axworthy to withdraw from the contest. Axworthy declined, denying that he was responsible for any wrongdoing.\\"Tories demand Axworthy's ouster\\", Windsor Star, 21 January 2006, A6. Vellacott was re-elected with an increased margin of victory.  In government  The Conservatives won a minority government in the 2006 election. Vellacott now sits as a government backbencher. In March 2006, he wrote an open letter supporting restrictions on abortion and calling for pregnant women to be informed of possible risks associated with abortion.Maurice Vellacott, \\"Time for limits\\", Calgary Herald, 10 March 2006, A25. In April 2006, Vellacott attracted negative attention when he claimed that aboriginal people would travel to the outskirts of Saskatoon to drink in a shack around the same time that allegations surfaced that Saskatoon police were dropping off aboriginal people on \\"moonlight riders.\\" Vellacott would admit that he never saw the existence of a drinking shack. Vellacott Never Saw Shack He was appointed to serve as chairman for the Commons' aboriginal affairs committee in April 2006. He attracted controversy one month later, after suggesting that Canadian judges consider themselves to have \\"god-like powers\\" when rendering their decisions. Vellacott claimed Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin said that \\"when they step into this role [of supreme court justice] that suddenly there's some kind of mystical power that comes over them, which everything that they've ever decreed is not to be questioned.\\"Terry Weber, \\"Top court comments not those of government: Harper\\", Globe and Mail (Breaking News), 8 May 2006. McLachlin, through a spokesperson, denied having made that comment. Vellacott later issued an apology, indicating that he did not intend to imply McLachlin had actually used the phrase \\"god- like powers\\". He added that he was alluding to comments made by McLachlin at a Lord Cooke Lecture, given on December 1, 2005 at the University of Victoria in Wellington, New Zealand. (Journalists noted that the \\"mystical power\\" quote does not appear in McLachlin's speech.)\\"Supreme chief sees herself as just that\\", Montreal Gazette, 14 May 2006, A16. Vellacott also informed reporters that he regards judicial independence as a \\"fundamental aspect of a free and democratic society\\".Sue Bailey, editorial, Canadian Press, 8 May 2006, 16:49 report. Vellacott resigned from his role as committee chairman following significant opposition from other parties. He now serves as a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment, and has called for the Canadian government to intervene against state-sponsored violence in the Darfur province of Sudan.Mike Blanchfield, \\"MPs push for action on Sudan\\", Ottawa Citizen, 30 April 2006, A4. During his time in parliament, Vellacott has served as deputy critic for health, Human Resources Development Canada, and Indian Affairs. He has or has had involvement with several organizations, including the Canadian Club and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, and is a supporter of Focus on the Family.\\"About Maurice\\" (accessed 27 March 2006). He received the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, the Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan in March 2006 and a Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012; all were automatic by virtue of being an elected Member of Parliament. Vellacott was re-elected in the 2008 federal election. In 2012, Vellacott nominated and awarded Queen's Jubilee medals to Linda Gibbons and Mary Wagner, who had both been convicted of criminal offences related to their anti- abortion activism.http://o.canada.com/2012/10/22/jailed-anti-abortion- activist-awarded-one-of-queens-jubilee-medals/ Gibbons was arrested for repeated violations of injunctions against protesting in front of women's health clinics.http://life.nationalpost.com/tag/linda-gibbons/ Mary Wagner was serving time in jail for mischief and violating court orders regarding women's health clinics when she received her medal.https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/Celebrate+these+Diamond+Jubilee+jailbirds/7435270/story.html When asked to comment on his decision to recognize these two women, Vellacott released a statement that referred to them as \\"heroines of humanity\\", and justified his decision by stating: \\"It's a pretty upside down world when we honour abortionists like Henry Morgentaler for killing over 5,000 babies and imprison precious women, like Mary Wagner and Linda Gibbons, who try to save babies from such savagery. They are the real heroes of humanity!\\" Vellacott's decision to bestow the Queen's Jubilee Medal on Gibbon and Wagner has been praised by pro-life groups such as the Campaign Life Coalition, and the Catholic Register. Interim Liberal leader Bob Rae criticized Vellacott's statements as inciting anti-abortion activists to break the law,http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/11/02/tory-mp-maurice-vellacott-has-is- inciting-anti-abortion-activists-to-break-law-bob-rae/ which is itself a criminal offence in Canada.

The advantage of using a sensor array over using a single sensor lies in the fact that an array adds new dimensions to the observation, helping to estimate more parameters and improve the estimation performance. For example an array of radio antenna elements used for beamforming can increase antenna gain in the direction of the signal while decreasing the gain in other directions, i.e., increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by amplifying the signal coherently. Another example of sensor array application is to estimate the direction of arrival of impinging electromagnetic waves. The related processing method is called array signal processing. Application examples of array signal processing include radar/sonar, wireless communications, seismology, machine condition monitoring, astronomical observations fault diagnosis, etc. Using array signal processing, the temporal and spatial properties (or parameters) of the impinging signals interfered by noise and hidden in the data collected by the sensor array can be estimated and revealed. This is known as parameter estimation. Figure 1: Linear array and incident angle  Plane wave, time domain beamforming  Figure 1 illustrates a six-element uniform linear array (ULA). In this example, the sensor array is assumed to be in the far-field of a signal source so that it can be treated as planar wave. Parameter estimation takes advantage of the fact that the distance from the source to each antenna in the array is different, which means that the input data at each antenna will be phase-shifted replicas of each other. Eq. (1) shows the calculation for the extra time it takes to reach each antenna in the array relative to the first one, where c is the velocity of the wave. \\\\Delta t_i = \\\\frac{(i-1)d \\\\cos \\\\theta}{c}, i = 1, 2, ..., M \\\\ \\\\ (1) Each sensor is associated with a different delay. The delays are small but not trivial. In frequency domain, they are displayed as phase shift among the signals received by the sensors. The delays are closely related to the incident angle and the geometry of the sensor array. Given the geometry of the array, the delays or phase differences can be used to estimate the incident angle. Eq. (1) is the mathematical basis behind array signal processing. Simply summing the signals received by the sensors and calculating the mean value give the result y = \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\\\boldsymbol x_i (t-\\\\Delta t_i) . Because the received signals are out of phase, this mean value does not give an enhanced signal compared with the original source. Heuristically, if we can find delays of each of the received signals and remove them prior to the summation, the mean value y = \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\\\boldsymbol x_i (t) will result in an enhanced signal. The process of time-shifting signals using a well selected set of delays for each channel of the sensor array so that the signal is added constructively is called beamforming. In addition to the delay-and-sum approach described above, a number of spectral based (non- parametric) approaches and parametric approaches exist which improve various performance metrics. These beamforming algorithms are briefly described as follows.  Array design  Sensor arrays have different geometrical designs, including linear, circular, planar, cylindrical and spherical arrays. There are sensor arrays with arbitrary array configuration, which require more complex signal processing techniques for parameter estimation. In uniform linear array (ULA) the phase of the incoming signal \\\\omega\\\\tau should be limited to \\\\pm\\\\pi to avoid grating waves. It means that for angle of arrival \\\\theta in the interval [-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2},\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}] sensor spacing should be smaller than half the wavelength d \\\\leq \\\\lambda/2. However, the width of the main beam, i.e., the resolution or directivity of the array, is determined by the length of the array compared to the wavelength. In order to have a decent directional resolution the length of the array should be several times larger than the radio wavelength.  Types of sensor arrays  = Antenna array = *Antenna array (electromagnetic), a geometrical arrangement of antenna elements with a deliberate relationship between their currents, forming a single antenna usually to achieve a desired radiation pattern *Directional array, an antenna array optimized for directionality *Phased array, An antenna array where the phase shifts (and amplitudes) applied to the elements are modified electronically, typically in order to steer the antenna system's directional pattern, without the use of moving parts *Smart antenna, a phased array in which a signal processor computes phase shifts to optimize reception and/or transmission to a receiver on the fly, such as is performed by cellular telephone towers *Digital antenna array, this is smart antenna with multi channels digital beamforming, usually by using FFT. *Interferometric array of radio telescopes or optical telescopes, used to achieve high resolution through interferometric correlation *Watson-Watt / Adcock antenna array, using the Watson-Watt technique whereby two Adcock antenna pairs are used to perform an amplitude comparison on the incoming signal = Acoustic arrays = *Microphone array is used in acoustic measurement and beamforming *Loudspeaker array is used in acoustic measurement and beamforming = Other arrays = *Geophone array used in Reflection seismology *Sonar array is an array of hydrophones used in underwater imaging  Delay-and-sum beamforming  If a time delay is added to the recorded signal from each microphone that is equal and opposite of the delay caused by the additional travel time, it will result in signals that are perfectly in-phase with each other. Summing these in-phase signals will result in constructive interference that will amplify the SNR by the number of antennas in the array. This is known as delay-and-sum beamforming. For direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, one can iteratively test time delays for all possible directions. If the guess is wrong, the signal will be interfered destructively, resulting in a diminished output signal, but the correct guess will result in the signal amplification described above. The problem is, before the incident angle is estimated, how could it be possible to know the time delay that is 'equal' and opposite of the delay caused by the extra travel time? It is impossible. The solution is to try a series of angles \\\\hat{\\\\theta} \\\\in [0, \\\\pi] at sufficiently high resolution, and calculate the resulting mean output signal of the array using Eq. (3). The trial angle that maximizes the mean output is an estimation of DOA given by the delay-and-sum beamformer. Adding an opposite delay to the input signals is equivalent to rotating the sensor array physically. Therefore, it is also known as beam steering.  Spectrum-based beamforming  Delay and sum beamforming is a time domain approach. It is simple to implement, but it may poorly estimate direction of arrival (DOA). The solution to this is a frequency domain approach. The Fourier transform transforms the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. This converts the time delay between adjacent sensors into a phase shift. Thus, the array output vector at any time t can be denoted as \\\\boldsymbol x(t) = x_1(t)\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & e^{-j\\\\omega\\\\Delta t} & \\\\cdots & e^{-j\\\\omega(M-1)\\\\Delta t} \\\\end{bmatrix}^T , where x_1(t) stands for the signal received by the first sensor. Frequency domain beamforming algorithms use the spatial covariance matrix, represented by \\\\boldsymbol R=E\\\\\\\\{ \\\\boldsymbol x(t) \\\\boldsymbol x^T(t)\\\\\\\\}. This M by M matrix carries the spatial and spectral information of the incoming signals. Assuming zero-mean Gaussian white noise, the basic model of the spatial covariance matrix is given by \\\\boldsymbol R = \\\\boldsymbol V \\\\boldsymbol S \\\\boldsymbol V^H + \\\\sigma^2 \\\\boldsymbol I \\\\ \\\\ (4) where \\\\sigma^2 is the variance of the white noise, \\\\boldsymbol I is the identity matrix and \\\\boldsymbol V is the array manifold vector \\\\boldsymbol V = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol v_1 & \\\\cdots & \\\\boldsymbol v_k \\\\end{bmatrix}^T with \\\\boldsymbol v_i = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & e^{-j\\\\omega\\\\Delta t_i} & \\\\cdots & e^{-j\\\\omega(M-1)\\\\Delta t_i} \\\\end{bmatrix}^T . This model is of central importance in frequency domain beamforming algorithms. Some spectrum-based beamforming approaches are listed below. = Conventional (Bartlett) beamformer = The Bartlett beamformer is a natural extension of conventional spectral analysis (spectrogram) to the sensor array. Its spectral power is represented by \\\\hat{P}_{Bartlett}(\\\\theta)=\\\\boldsymbol v^H \\\\boldsymbol R \\\\boldsymbol v \\\\ \\\\ (5) . The angle that maximizes this power is an estimation of the angle of arrival. = MVDR (Capon) beamformer = The Minimum Variance Distortionless Response beamformer, also known as the Capon beamforming algorithm,J. Capon, “High–Resolution Frequency–Wavenumber Spectrum Analysis,” Proceedings of the IEEE, 1969, Vol. 57, pp. 1408–1418 has a power given by \\\\hat{P}_{Capon}(\\\\theta)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\boldsymbol v^H \\\\boldsymbol R^{-1} \\\\boldsymbol v} \\\\ \\\\ (6) . Though the MVDR/Capon beamformer can achieve better resolution than the conventional (Bartlett) approach, but this algorithm has higher complexity due to the full-rank matrix inversion. Technical advances in GPU computing have begun to narrow this gap and make real-time Capon beamforming possible. = MUSIC beamformer = MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) beamforming algorithm starts with decomposing the covariance matrix as given by Eq. (4) for both the signal part and the noise part. The eigen-decomposition of is represented by \\\\boldsymbol R = \\\\boldsymbol U_s \\\\boldsymbol \\\\Lambda_s \\\\boldsymbol U_s^H + \\\\boldsymbol U_n \\\\boldsymbol \\\\Lambda_n \\\\boldsymbol U_n^H \\\\ \\\\ (7) . MUSIC uses the noise sub-space of the spatial covariance matrix in the denominator of the Capon algorithm \\\\hat{P}_{MUSIC}(\\\\theta)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\boldsymbol v^H \\\\boldsymbol U_n \\\\boldsymbol U_n^H\\\\boldsymbol v} \\\\ \\\\ (8) . Therefore MUSIC beamformer is also known as subspace beamformer. Compared to the Capon beamformer, it gives much better DOA estimation. = SAMV beamformer = SAMV beamforming algorithm is a sparse signal reconstruction based algorithm which explicitly exploits the time invariant statistical characteristic of the covariance matrix. It achieves superresolution and robust to highly correlated signals.  Parametric beamformers  One of the major advantages of the spectrum based beamformers is a lower computational complexity, but they may not give accurate DOA estimation if the signals are correlated or coherent. An alternative approach are parametric beamformers, also known as maximum likelihood (ML) beamformers. One example of a maximum likelihood method commonly used in engineering is the least squares method. In the least square approach, a quadratic penalty function is used. To get the minimum value (or least squared error) of the quadratic penalty function (or objective function), take its derivative (which is linear), let it equal zero and solve a system of linear equations. In ML beamformers the quadratic penalty function is used to the spatial covariance matrix and the signal model. One example of ML beamformer penalty function is L_{ML}(\\\\theta)=\\\\\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol R}- \\\\boldsymbol R\\\\_F^2 = \\\\\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol R}-( \\\\boldsymbol V \\\\boldsymbol S \\\\boldsymbol V^H + \\\\sigma^2 \\\\boldsymbol I )\\\\_F^2 \\\\ \\\\ (9) , where \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\_F is the Frobenius norm. It can be seen in Eq. (4) that the penalty function of Eq. (9) is minimized by approximating the signal model to the sample covariance matrix as accurate as possible. In other words, the maximum likelihood beamformer is to find the DOA \\\\theta, the independent variable of matrix \\\\boldsymbol V , so that the penalty function in Eq. (9) is minimized. In practice, the penalty function may look different, depending on the signal and noise model. For this reason, there are two major categories of maximum likelihood beamformers: Deterministic ML beamformers and stochastic ML beamformers, corresponding to a deterministic and a stochastic model, respectively. Another idea to change the former penalty equation is the consideration of simplifying the minimization by differentiation of the penalty function. In order to simplify the optimization algorithm, logarithmic operations and the probability density function (PDF) of the observations may be used in some ML beamformers. The optimizing problem is solved by finding the roots of the derivative of the penalty function after equating it with zero. Because the equation is non-linear a numerical searching approach such as Newton–Raphson method is usually employed. The Newton–Raphson method is an iterative root search method with the iteration x_{n+1} = x_n - \\\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\\\ \\\\ (10). The search starts from an initial guess x_0. If the Newton-Raphson search method is employed to minimize the beamforming penalty function, the resulting beamformer is called Newton ML beamformer. Several well-known ML beamformers are described below without providing further details due to the complexity of the expressions. ;Deterministic maximum likelihood beamformer :In deterministic maximum likelihood beamformer (DML), the noise is modeled as a stationary Gaussian white random processes while the signal waveform as deterministic (but arbitrary) and unknown. ;Stochastic maximum likelihood beamformer :In stochastic maximum likelihood beamformer (SML), the noise is modeled as stationary Gaussian white random processes (the same as in DML) whereas the signal waveform as Gaussian random processes. ;Method of direction estimation :Method of direction estimation (MODE) is subspace maximum likelihood beamformer, just as MUSIC, is the subspace spectral based beamformer. Subspace ML beamforming is obtained by eigen-decomposition of the sample covariance matrix.  References  Further reading * H. L.

Also called a \\"dietary estrogen\\", it is a diverse group of naturally occurring nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of its structural similarity with estradiol (17-β-estradiol), have the ability to cause estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic effects. Phytoestrogens are not essential nutrients because their absence from the diet does not cause a disease, nor are they known to participate in any normal biological function. Its name comes from the Greek phyto (\\"plant\\") and estrogen, the hormone which gives fertility to female mammals. The word \\"estrus\\" - Greek οίστρος - means \\"sexual desire\\", and \\"gene\\" - Greek γόνο - is \\"to generate\\". It has been hypothesized that plants use a phytoestrogen as part of their natural defence against the overpopulation of herbivore animals by controlling female fertility. The similarities, at molecular level, of an estrogen and a phytoestrogen allow them to mildly mimic and sometimes act as an antagonist of estrogen. Phytoestrogens were first observed in 1926, but it was unknown if they could have any effect in human or animal metabolism. In the 1940s and early 1950s, it was noticed that some pastures of subterranean clover and red clover (phytoestrogen-rich plants) had adverse effects on the fecundity of grazing sheep. right  Structure  Phytoestrogens mainly belong to a large group of substituted natural phenolic compounds: the coumestans, prenylflavonoids and isoflavones are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in soy and red clover. Lignans have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids. Mycoestrogens have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of Fusarium, especially common on cereal grains, but also occurring elsewhere, e.g. on various forages. Although mycoestrogens are rarely taken into account in discussions about phytoestrogens, these are the compounds that initially generated the interest on the topic.  Mechanism of action  Phytoestrogens exert their effects primarily through binding to estrogen receptors (ER). There are two variants of the estrogen receptor, alpha (ER-α) and beta (ER-β) and many phytoestrogens display somewhat higher affinity for ER-β compared to ER-α. The key structural elements that enable phytoestrogens to bind with high affinity to estrogen receptors and display estradiol-like effects are: * The phenolic ring that is indispensable for binding to estrogen receptor * The ring of isoflavones mimicking a ring of estrogens at the receptors binding site * Low molecular weight similar to estrogens (MW=272) * Distance between two hydroxyl groups at the isoflavones nucleus similar to that occurring in estradiol * Optimal hydroxylation pattern In addition to interaction with ERs, phytoestrogens may also modulate the concentration of endogenous estrogens by binding or inactivating some enzymes, and may affect the bioavailability of sex hormones by depressing or stimulating the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Emerging evidence shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In vitro studies show an activation of PPARs at concentrations above 1 μM, which is higher than the activation level of ERs. At the concentration below 1 μM, activation of ERs may play a dominant role. At higher concentrations (>1 μM), both ERs and PPARs are activated. Studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influence each other and therefore induce differential effects in a dose- dependent way. The final biological effects of genistein are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions.  Ecology  These compounds in plants are an important part of their defense system, mainly against fungi. Phytoestrogens are ancient naturally occurring substances, and as dietary phytochemicals they are considered as co-evolutive with mammals. In the human diet, phytoestrogens are not the only source of exogenous estrogens. Xenoestrogens (novel, man-made), are found as food additives and ingredients, and also in cosmetics, plastics, and insecticides. Environmentally, they have similar effects as phytoestrogens, making it difficult to clearly separate the action of these two kind of agents in studies done on populations. Avian studies The consumption of plants with unusual content of phytoestrogens, under drought conditions, has been shown to decrease fertility in quail. Parrot food as available in nature has shown only weak estrogenic activity. Studies have been conducted on screening methods for environmental estrogens present in manufactured supplementary food, with the purpose of aiding reproduction of endangered species.  Food sources  According to one study of nine common phytoestrogens in a Western diet, foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content were nuts and oilseeds, followed by soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. Flax seed and other oilseeds contained the highest total phytoestrogen content, followed by soybeans and tofu. The highest concentrations of isoflavones are found in soybeans and soybean products followed by legumes, whereas lignans are the primary source of phytoestrogens found in nuts and oilseeds (e.g. flax) and also found in cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Phytoestrogen content varies in different foods, and may vary significantly within the same group of foods (e.g. soy beverages, tofu) depending on processing mechanisms and type of soybean used. Legumes (in particular soybeans), whole grain cereals, and some seeds are high in phytoestrogens. A more comprehensive list of foods known to contain phytoestrogens includes: *Soybeans and soy products *Tempeh *Linseed (flax) *Sesame seeds *Wheat berries *Fenugreek (contains diosgenin, but also used to make Testofen, a compound taken by men to increase testosterone). *Oats *Barley *Beans *Lentils *Yams *Rice *Alfalfa *Mung beans *Apples *Carrots *Pomegranates *Wheat germ *Rice bran *Lupin *Kudzu *Coffee *Licorice root *Mint *Ginseng *Hops, *Bourbon whiskey *Beer, *Fennel *Anise. *Red clover (sometimes a constituent of green manure). *Spinach An epidemiological study of women in the United States found that the dietary intake of phytoestrogens in healthy post-menopausal Caucasian women is less than one milligram daily.  Effects on humans  In human beings, phytoestrogens are readily absorbed into the circulatory system, circulate in plasma, and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence is different from that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus monogastric digestive systems. A wide range of beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on the cardiovascular, metabolic, central nervous systems as well as reduction of risk of cancer and post menopausal symptoms have been claimed. However, there is also concern that phytoestrogens may act as endocrine disruptors that adversely affect health. Based on currently available evidence, it is not clear whether the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens outweigh their risks. = Males = It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on male sexuality, with conflicting results about the potential effects of isoflavones originating from soy. A 2010 meta-analysis of fifteen placebo-controlled studies led by Dr. Mark Messina, executive director of the Soy Nutrition Institute, said that \\"neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone concentrations in men.\\" Some studies showed that isoflavone supplementation had no effect on sperm concentration, count, or motility, and had no effects on testicular or ejaculate volume. Sperm count decline and increasing rate of testicular cancers in the West may be linked to a higher presence of isoflavone phytoestrogens in the diet while in utero, but such a link has not been definitively proven. Furthermore, there is some evidence that phytoestrogens may affect male fertility, but \\"further investigation is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn\\". = Females = It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on the cause or prevention of cancer in females. Some epidemiological studies have suggested a protective effect against breast cancer. Other epidemiological studies found that consumption of soy estrogens is safe for patients with breast cancer, and that it may decrease mortality and recurrence rates. It remains unclear if phytoestrogens can minimize some of the deleterious effects of low estrogen levels (hypoestrogenism) resulting from oophorectomy, menopause, or other causes. A Cochrane Review of the use of phytoestrogens to relieve the vasomotor symptoms of menopause (hot flashes) stated that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest any benefit to their use, although genistein effects should be further investigated. = Infant formula = Some studies have found that some concentrations of isoflavones may have effects on intestinal cells. At low doses, genistein acted as a weak estrogen and stimulated cell growth; at high doses, it inhibited proliferation and altered cell cycle dynamics. This biphasic response correlates with how genistein is thought to exert its effects. Some reviews express the opinion that more research is needed to answer the question of what effect phytoestrogens may have on infants, but their authors did not find any adverse effects. Studies conclude there are no adverse effects in human growth, development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula compared to conventional cow-milk formula. The American Academy of Pediatrics states: \\"although isolated soy protein-based formulas may be used to provide nutrition for normal growth and development, there are few indications for their use in place of cow milk- based formula. These indications include (a) for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency (rare) and (b) in situations in which a vegetarian diet is preferred.\\" Ethnopharmacology In some countries, phytoestrogenic plants have been used for centuries in the treatment of menstrual and menopausal problems, as well as for fertility problems. Plants used that have been shown to contain phytoestrogens include Pueraria mirifica, and its close relative, kudzu, Angelica, fennel, and anise. In a rigorous study, the use of one such source of phytoestrogen, red clover, has been shown to be safe, but ineffective in relieving menopausal symptoms (black cohosh is also used for menopausal symptoms, but does not contain phytoestrogens.)

The Caesar brothers spent their childhood and teen years in Yorkville, the same Manhattan neighborhood where the Marx Brothers were raised. Caesar knew the Marx Brothers during his childhood. He was educated at Chappaqua Mountain Institute in Chappaqua, New York. In his career Caesar collaborated with a wide variety of composers and songwriters, including Rudolf Friml, George Gershwin, Sigmund Romberg, Victor Herbert, Ted Koehler and Ray Henderson. Two of his best known numbers, I Want to Be Happy and Tea for Two, were written with Vincent Youmans for the 1925 musical No, No, Nanette. Another of his biggest hits, Animal Crackers in My Soup, was popularized by Shirley Temple in her 1935 film Curly Top. \\"Just a Gigolo\\", his 1929 adaptation of an Austrian song, was a hit for Louis Prima in the 1950s and again for David Lee Roth in the 1980s. In the late 1930s, he and composer Gerald Marks wrote a famous series of children's songs focusing on safety. Caesar made hundreds of appearances in schools performing the \\"Sing a Song of Safety,\\" \\"Sing a Song of Friendship\\" (a United Nations-inspired series focusing on world peace, racial tolerance and friendship) and \\"Songs of Health\\" collections. Caesar served on the songwriters' performance-rights organization ASCAP board of directors from 1930 to 1946 and again from 1949 to 1966. He was a founder of the Songwriters Guild of America. He died aged 101, in New York on December 18, 1996. {align=right  } Broadway credits Note: All productions are musicals unless otherwise stated. *La La Lucille (1919) - additional lyrics *Kissing Time (1920) - adaptation of an earlier version of this musical - co-lyricist *Pins and Needles (1922) - revue - co-lyricist *The Greenwich Village Follies of 1922 (1922) - revue - co-lyricist and co-bookwriter *The Greenwich Village Follies of 1923 (1923) - revue - co-lyricist *The Greenwich Village Follies of 1924 (1924) - revue - co-lyricist *Betty Lee (1924) - co-lyricist *No, No, Nanette (1925) - co-lyricist *Charlot Revue (1925) - revue - featured lyricist for \\"Gigolette\\" and \\"A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You\\" *Sweetheart Time (1926) - co-lyricist *Ziegfeld's Revue \\"No Foolin'\\" (1926) - revue - co- lyricist *Betsy (1926) - co-bookwriter *Talk About Girls (1927) - lyricist *Yes, Yes, Yvette (1927) - story originator *Here's Howe (1928) - lyricist *Americana of 1928 (1928) - revue - co-lyricist *Polly (1929) - co-composer and co-lyricist *George White's Scandals of 1929 (1929) - revue - co-composer and co-lyricist *Ripples (1930) - co-lyricist *Nina Rosa (1930) - lyricist *The Wonder Bar (1931) - play - co-playwright/adaptor of the original German *George White's Scandals of 1931 (1931) - revue - co-bookwriter *George White's Music Hall Varieties of 1932 (1932) - revue - co-composer and lyricist *Melody (1933) - lyricist *Shady Lady (1933) - reviser *Continental Varieties (1934) - revue - dialogue-writer *The White Horse Inn (1936) - English-version lyricist *My Dear Public (1943) - co-composer, co-lyricist, and co-bookwriter Post-retirement credits: *The American Dance Machine (1978) - dance revue - featured lyricist *Up in One (1979) - revue - featured songwriter *Big Deal (1986) - featured English-version lyricist for \\"Just a Gigolo\\" *Sally Marr...and her escorts (1994) - play - featured lyricist for \\"Tea for Two\\" References External links New York Times obituary * Irving Caesar recordings at the Discography of American Historical Recordings.

It seeks, according to womanist scholar Layli Maparyan (Phillips), to \\"restore the balance between people and the environment/nature and reconcil[e] human life with the spiritual dimension\\". Writer Alice Walker coined the term \\"womanist\\" in a short story, \\"Coming Apart\\", in 1979.. Since Walker's initial use, the term has evolved to envelop varied, and often opposing, interpretations of conceptions such as feminism, men, and Blackness. Theory Womanist theory, while diverse, holds at its core that both femininity and culture are equally important to the woman's existence. In this conception, one's femininity cannot be stripped from the culture within which it exists. At first glance, this seems similar to the thought process of third wave feminism, which embraced the concept of intersectionality. Intersectionality is a term that was created to understand how oppressive structures like racism, classism, and sexism are inseparable from people's identities and experiences. The term was coined in 1989 by scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw to describe the intertwined impacts of racism and sexism upon Black women. The difference between the two concepts lies in the valuation placed on intersectionality within the theoretical frameworks. Womanism supports the idea that the culture of the woman, which in this case is the focal point of intersection as opposed to class or some other characteristic, is not an element of her femininity but rather is the lens through which femininity exists. As such, a woman's Blackness is not a component of her feminism. Instead, her Blackness is the lens through which she understands her femininity. In discussing womanist theory, one must acknowledge the racism that was perceived by Black women in the feminist movement. Early feminist activism around suffrage (first-wave feminism) in the United States held no place for women of color, as women of color were not seen as feminine in the same ways as white women and therefore lacked certain qualities that would ensure their inclusion. The rise of second-wave feminism brought an inclusion of women of color within the movement. However, white feminists equated this inclusion with being colorblind and ignored race because they believed the focus should be entirely on gender. However, because of this narrow focus, white feminists and feminists of color could not create an interracial movement. As a result of this disconnect between the groups, a third-wave feminism began and included the concepts of intersectionality and womanism. The historic exclusion of women of color from the broader feminist movement has resulted in two interpretations of womanism. Some womanists believe that the experience of Black women will not be validated by feminists to be equal to the experience of white women because of the problematic way in which some feminists treated Blackness throughout history. As such, womanists do not see womanism as an extension of feminism, but rather as a theoretical framework which exists independent of feminist theory. This is a move from the thought of Black feminists who have carved their own space in feminism through academia and activism. However, not all womanists hold this view of womanism in relation to feminism. The chronological first conception of womanism can be captured through Alice Walker's quotation \\"womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender\\". Under this description, the theories are seemingly intimately tied, with womanism as the broad umbrella under which feminism falls. Theoretical origins =Alice Walker= Author and poet Alice Walker first used the term \\"womanist\\" in her short story, \\"Coming Apart\\", in 1979, and later in In Search of our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose (1983). Walker defined a \\"womanist\\" as a \\"black feminist or feminist of color. From the black folk expression of mothers to female children, 'You acting womanish'\\", referring to grown-up behavior.The Black Scholar, Vol. 26, No. 1, The Challenge of Blackness (Winter/Spring 1996). The womanish girl exhibits willful, courageous, and outrageous behavior that is considered to be beyond the scope of societal norms. She goes on to say that a womanist is also: According to Walker, while feminism is incorporated into womanism, it is also instinctively pro-humankind; womanism is a broader category that includes feminism as a subtype. The focus of the theology is not on gender inequality, but race and class-based oppression. She sees womanism as a theory/movement for the survival of the black race; a theory that takes into consideration the experiences of black women, black culture, black myths, spiritual life, and orality. Walker's much cited phrase, \\"womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender\\", suggests that feminism is a component beneath the much larger ideological umbrella of womanism. Walker's definition also holds that womanists are universalists. This philosophy is further invoked by her metaphor of a garden where are all flowers bloom equally. A womanist is committed to the survival of both males and females and desires a world where men and women can coexist, while maintaining their cultural distinctiveness. This inclusion of men provides Black women with an opportunity to address gender oppression without directly attacking men. A third definition provided by Walker pertains to the sexuality of the women portrayed in her review of \\"Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson\\". Here, she argues that the best term to describe Rebecca Jackson, a black Shaker who leaves her husband and goes on to live with her white Shaker companion, would be a womanist, because it is a word that affirms the connection to the world, regardless of sexuality. The seemingly contrasting interpretations of womanism given by Walker validates the experiences of African-American women, while promoting a visionary perspective for the world based on said experiences. The short story \\"Everyday Use\\" by Alice Walker illustrates the voice of a black rural middle- class woman through the relationship that a black woman shares with her two daughters Dee and Maggie.Walker, Alice (February 19, 2015), \\"Everyday Use.\\" American Studies at the University of Virginia. University of Virginia. Dee is spoiled and believes that her education and experiences make her better than her mother and her sister. On the other hand, Maggie envies her sister for her the beauty and arrogance that always gets her what she wants. Historically, it has been very common for people of color to have their stories told by Caucasians. Walker attempts to break this tradition by having a black rural middle-class woman tell the story of her relationships with her two daughters. An important part of the story occurs when the mother in \\"Everyday Use\\" states, \\"You've no doubt seen those TV shows where the child who has \\"made it\\" is confronted, as a surprise, by her own mother and father, tottering in weakly from backstage... Sometimes I dream a dream in which Dee and I are suddenly brought together on a TV program of this sort...\\". Here the mother reminisces about a family experience that she has witnessed on television that she wishes she could have for herself. A heart-warming scene similar to the one that the mother witnessed on television does not take place when her daughter Dee comes to visit. Instead when Dee comes to visit the mother a rough, awkward tension-filled encounter slowly unfolds. Walker employs this story and its context to illustrate that a majority of womanism is characterized by black women telling their stories. Much of Alice Walker's progeny admits that while she is the creator of the term, Walker fails to consistently define the term and often contradicts herself. At some points she portrays womanism as a more inclusive revision of Black feminism as it is not limited to Black women and focuses on the woman as a whole. Later in life she begins to regret this peace seeking and inclusive form of womanism due to the constant and consistent prejudice inflicted upon Black women, specifically, whose voices had yet to be validated by both White women and Black men. =Clenora Hudson-Weems= Clenora Hudson-Weems is credited with coining the term Africana womanism. In 1995, the publication of her book, Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves sent shock waves through the Black nationalism community and established her as an independent thinker.Nikol G. Alexander- Floyd and Evelyn M. Simien. Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Vol. 27, No. 1 (2006), pp. 67-89. Hudson-Weems rejects feminism as the theology of Africana women, that is to say women of the African diaspora, because it is philosophically rooted in Eurocentric ideals. Hudson-Weems identifies further differences between womanism and feminism being; womanism is \\"family-oriented\\" and focuses on race, class, and gender, while feminism is \\"female-oriented\\" and strictly focuses on gender. She further asserts that it is impossible to incorporate the cultural perspectives of African women into the feminism ideal due to the history of slavery and racism in America. Furthermore, Weems rejects feminism's characterization of the man as the enemy. She claims that this does not connect with Africana women as they do not see Africana men as the enemy. Instead the enemy is the oppressive force that subjugates the Africana man, woman, and child. She claims that feminism's masculine-feminine binary comes from a lack of additional hardship placed on women by their circumstances (i.e. race and socio-economic) as feminism was founded to appeal to upper-class White women. She also distances the Africana woman from Black feminism by demarcating the latter as distinctly African-American which is in turn distinctly western. She also critiques Black feminism as a subset of feminism needing the validation of White feminists for their voices to be heard. She claims that feminism will never truly accept Black feminists, but instead relegate them to the fringes of the feminist movement.Russo, Stacy. \\"The Womanist Reader by Layli Phillips\\" (review), Feminist Teacher, 2009: 243-45. JSTOR. She ultimately claims that the matriarchs of the Black feminist movement will never be put into the same conversation as the matriarchs of the feminist movement. A large part of her work mirrors separatist Black Nationalist discourse, because of the focus on the collective rather than the individual as the forefront of her ideology. Hudson-Weems refutes Africana womanism as an addendum to feminism, and asserts that her ideology differs from Black feminism, Walker's womanism, and African womanism. =Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi= Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi is a Nigerian literary critic. In 1985, she published the article \\"Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English\\", and described her interpretation of womanism. She asserts that the womanist vision is to answer the ultimate question of how to equitably share power among the races and between the sexes. She arrived at her interpretation of the term independently of Alice Walker's definition, yet there are several overlaps between the two ideologies. In alignment with Walker's definition focusing on blackness and womanhood, Ogunyemi writes, \\"Black womanism is a philosophy that celebrates black roots, the ideals of black life, while giving a balanced presentation of black womandom,\\" Rather than citing gender inequality as the source of Black oppression, Ogunyemi takes a separatist stance much like Hudson-Weems, and dismisses the possibility of reconciliation of white feminists and black feminists on the grounds of the intractability of racism. She uses a few examples of how feminists write about Blackness and African Blackness specifically to make salient the need for an African conception of womanism. These critiques include the use of Blackness as a tool to forward feminist ideals without also forwarding ideals related to blackness, the thought that western feminism is a tool which would work in African nations without acknowledging cultural norms and differences, and a co-opting of things that African women have been doing for centuries before the western notion of feminism into western feminism. It is also important to note that Ogunyemi finds her conception of womanism's relationship with men at the cross roads of Walker's and Hudson Weems' conceptions. Walker's expresses a communal opportunity for men while acknowledging how they can be dangerous to the womanist community. While Hudson-Weems' conception refuses to see the Africana man as an enemy, disregarding the harm that Africana men have imparted on to the community. Ideologies Womanism has various definitions and interpretations. At its broadest definition, it is a universalist ideology for all women, regardless of color. A womanist is, according to Walker's 1979 story Coming Apart, an African-American heterosexual woman willing to utilize wisdom from African- American lesbians about how to improve sexual relationships and avoid being sexually objectified. In the context of men's destructive use of pornography and their exploitation of Black women as pornographic objects, a womanist is also committed to \\"the survival and wholeness of an entire people, male and female\\"Hogan, L. (1995), From Women's Experience to Feminist Theology, Sheffield, England: Sheffield Academic Press. through confronting oppressive forces. Walker's much cited phrase, \\"womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender\\" suggests that Walker considers feminism as a component of the wider ideological umbrella of womanism. It focuses on the unique experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of not just Black women, but all women of color in addition to critically addressing the dynamics of the conflict between the mainstream feminist, the Black feminist, the African feminist, and the Africana womanist movement. However, there is Black nationalist discourse prevalent within womanist work and for this reason scholars are divided between associating womanism with other similar ideologies such as Black feminism and Africana womanism or taking the stance that the three are inherently incompatible. =Black feminism= The Black feminist movement was formed in response to the needs of women who were racially underrepresented by the Women's Movement and sexually oppressed by the Black Liberation Movement. Black feminist scholars assert that African-American women are doubly disadvantaged in the social, economic, and political sphere, because they face discrimination on the basis of both race and gender.Simien, E. (2004). \\"Gender differences in attitudes toward Black feminism among African Americans\\", Political Science Quarterly, 119(2), 315-338. Retrieved November 20, 2013, from the JSTOR database. Black women felt that their needs were being ignored by both movements and they struggled to identify with either based on race or gender. African-American women who use the term Black feminism attach a variety of interpretations to it.Off Our Backs, Vol. 3, No. 10 (September 1973), p. 9. One such interpretation is that Black feminism addresses the needs of African-American women that the feminism movement largely ignores. Feminism, as Black feminist theorist Pearl Cleage defines it, is \\"the belief that women are full human beings capable of participation and leadership in the full range of human activities—intellectual, political, social, sexual, spiritual, and economic\\". With this definition, the feminist agenda can be said to encompass different issues ranging from political rights to educational opportunities within a global context. The Black feminist agenda seeks to streamline these issues and focuses on those that are the most applicable to African-American women. =Africana womanism= Clenora Hudson- Weems's Africana womanism arose from a nationalist Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores the limitations of feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory.Dove, N. (1998), \\"African Womanism: An Afrocentric Theory\\", Journal of Black Studies, 28(5), 515-539. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is set up in a way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. Weems professes womanism is separate from other feminism in that it has a different agenda, different priorities, and \\"focuses on the unique experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of Africana women.\\" She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man.Stephens, R., M. Keaveny, & V. Patton (2002). \\"'Come Colour My Rainbow': Themes of Africana Womanism in the Poetic Vision of Audrey Kathryn Bullett\\". Journal of Black Studies, 32(4), 464-466. Retrieved October 20, 2013, from the JSTOR database. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism, though closely related, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression. Womanist identity In her introduction to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its main concern is not the black woman per se but rather the black woman is the point of origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. \\"Purple is to Lavender\\" illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss.Jain, Dimpal, and Caroline Turner. \\"Purple Is to Lavender: Womanism, Resistance, and the Politics of Naming.\\" Negro Educational Review 6263.(2012) Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In \\"Purple is to Lavender\\", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty.They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino. They go on to describe the concept of \\"The Politics of Naming\\" which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism Jain states: \\"I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride\\" Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, \\"The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level.\\" This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: \\"I don't choose womanism because it is \\"better\\" than feminism ... I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it... because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see\\" For a majority of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals to the world that surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism it is important to remember that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.Tsuruta, D. (2012), \\"The Womanish Roots of Womanism: A Culturally-Derived and African-Centered Ideal(Concept)\\", The Western Journal of Black Studies, 36(1), 4. Retrieved November 20, 2013, from the EHIS database. =Literature and activism= Womanist literature and activism are two areas that are largely interpolated, with each having a considerable effect on the other. A major tenet of womanist literature and activism is the idea that Black activists and Black authors should separate themselves from the feminist ideology. This stems from assertions by Kalenda Eaton, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, and numerous other womanist theologians that the goal of a womanist should be to promote the issues affecting not just Black women, but black men and other groups that have been subjected to discrimination or impotence.Harris, M. L. (2010). \\"Introduction\\". Gifts of virtue, Alice Walker, and womanist ethics (p. 2). New York: Palgrave Macmillan. In the words of Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, a white woman writer may be a feminist, but a black woman writer is likely to be a womanist. That is, she recognizes that along with battling for sexual equality, she must also incorporate race, economics, culture, and politics within her philosophy.Sarah Smorol, Rocky Mountain Review, Vol. 63, No. 1 (Spring, 2009), pp. 133-134. In Kalenda Eaton's, Womanism, Literature and the Transformation of the Black Community, black women writers are portrayed as both activists and visionaries for change in the Black Community following the Civil Rights Movement. She interweaves the historical events of African-American history with the development of Afro-Politico womanism in a bid to create a haven for Black female activism within the black community. This Afro-Politico womanism veers from the traditional feminist goal of gender equality within a group and rather seeks to fight for the men and women whose civil rights are infringed upon. While Eaton takes the stance that Black women were largely excluded from the more prominent positions within the Black Movement, she argues that black women activists had the greatest effect in small-scale grassroots protests within their communities.Eaton, K. (2004). \\"Talkin' Bout a Revolution: Afro- Politico Womanism and the Ideological Transformation of the Black Community, 1965-1980\\" (electronic thesis or dissertation). Using various characters from Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, Alice Walker's Meridian, Toni Cade Bambara's The Salt Eaters, and Paule Marshall's The Chosen Place, the Timeless People as symbols of the various political agendas and issues that were prevalent within The Black Movement, Eaton draws upon the actions of the protagonists to illustrate solutions to the problems of disgruntlement and disorganization within the movement. Often the main task of these literary activists was to empower the impoverished masses—defined by Eaton as mainly Southern African- Americans, and they used the black middle class as a model for the possibility of social mobility within the African-American community. A common theme within womanist literature is the failure of Black women writers to identify with feminist thought. Womanism becomes the concept that binds these novelists together. In Audre Lorde's, The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House, she criticizes second-wave feminism, arguing that women were taught to ignore their differences, or alternately to let their differences divide them. Lorde never used the word \\"womanist\\" or \\"womanism\\" in her writing or in descriptions of herself, but her work has helped to further the concept. As she pointed out, traditional second-wave feminism lacked inclusivity and the concerns of women of color, or queer women were often ignored. =Spirituality= Spirituality concerns the desire for a connection with the sacred, the unseen, the superhuman, or the nonexistent. Patricia Hill Collins offers this definition: > Spirituality is not merely a system of religious beliefs similar to logical > systems of ideas. Rather, spirituality comprises articles of faith that > provide a conceptual framework for living everyday life Whereby religion is an institutional mechanism, spirituality is a personal one. Unlike religion, spirituality cannot be abandoned or switched. It is an integral component of one's consciousness. Womanist spirituality has six identifying characteristics—it is eclectic, synthetic, holistic, personal, visionary, and pragmatic. It draws from its resources and uses the summation of said resources to create a whole from multiple parts. Although it is ultimately defined by self, womanist spirituality envisions the larger picture and exists to solve problems and end injustice. Emilie Townes, a womanist theologian, further asserts that womanist spirituality grows out of individual and communal reflection on African American faith and life. She explains that it is not grounded in the notion that spirituality is a force but rather a practice separate from who we are moment by moment.Townes, E. M. (1995). In a blaze of glory: womanist spirituality as social witness. Nashville: Abingdon Press. One of the main characteristics of womanism is its religious aspect, commonly thought of as Christian. This connotation paints the picture of spiritual black womanists being \\"church going\\" women that play a vital role in the operation of the church. In William's article \\"Womanist Spirituality Defined\\" she discusses how womanist spirituality is directly connected to an individual's experiences with God.Williams, Khalia Jelks (April 16, 2015), \\"Engaging Womanist Spirituality In African American Christian Worship.\\" Proceedings Of The North American Academy For Liturgy. For instance, Williams declares, \\"the use of the term spirituality in this paper speaks of the everyday experiences of life and the way in which we relate to and interpret God at work in those experiences\\". This connotation is disputed in Monica Coleman's Roundtable Discussion: \\"Must I Be a Womanist?\\" where she focuses on the shortcomings of womanism that result from how individuals have historically described womanism. This holistic discussion of womanism is the result of a roundtable discussion. Coleman, who initiated the discussion, describes her thoughts on why she prefers black feminism as opposed to womanism, and she also discusses the limited scope that womanist religious scholarship embodies. Coleman offers deep insight into the spiritual aspect of womanism when she declares that, \\"Intentionally or not, womanists have created a Christian hegemonic discourse within the field\\". Here Coleman argues that the majority of womanists have painted the spiritual aspect of womanism to be spiritual in terms of Christianity. A specific example of this occurs in Walker's \\"Everyday Use\\", in the instance when the mother suddenly gains the courage to take a stand against her spoiled daughter as she declares, \\"When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet. Just like when I'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout\\". This could be categorized as an example of the spiritual aspect of womanism because of the mention of relation to the Christian God. However, Coleman provides a counter example to this assumption when she states: \\"How, for example, might a womanist interpret the strength Tina Turner finds in Buddhism and the role her faith played in helping her to leave a violent relationship?\\" Here Coleman pokes a hole in the pre-conceived notions of womanist scholarship. Coleman believes that the notorious sector of spirituality that womanism is most known for referring to is limited in its scope. Womanist religious scholarship has the ability to spread across a variety of paradigms and represent and support radical womanist spirituality. Considering womanism as a whole, it is also important to understand how it relates to feminism. =Ethics= Womanist ethics is a religious discipline that examines the ethical theories concerning human agency, action, and relationship. At the same time, it rejects social constructions that have neglected the existence of a group of women that have bared the brunt of injustice and oppression. Its perspective is shaped by the theological experiences of African-American women. With the use of analytic tools, the effect of race, class, gender, and sexuality on the individual and communal perspective is examined. Womanist ethic provides an alternative to Christian and other religious ethics while utilizing the elements of critique, description, and construction to assess the power imbalance and patriarchy that has been used to oppress women of color and their communities. The publication of Katie Cannon's The Emergence of Black Feminist Consciousness was the first to directly speak about womanist ethics. In this article, Cannon argues that the perspectives of Black women are largely ignored in various religious and academic discourses. Jacquelyn Grant expands on this point by asserting that Black women concurrently experience the three oppressive forces of racism, sexism, and classism. Black feminist theory has been used by womanist ethics to explain the lack of participation of African-American women and men in academic discourse. Patricia Collins, credits this phenomenon to prevalence of white men determining what should or should not be considered valid discourse and urges for an alternative mode of producing knowledge that includes the core themes of Black female consciousness. Critiques A major ongoing critique about womanist scholarship is the failure of many scholars to critically address homosexuality within the black community. Walker's protagonist in Coming Apart uses writings from two African-American lesbians, Audre Lorde and Louisah Teish, to support her argument that her husband should stop consuming pornography. She posts quotes from Audre Lorde above her kitchen sink. In Search of Our Mother's Garden states that a womanist is \\"a woman who loves another woman, sexually and/or non-sexually\\", yet despite Coming Apart and In Search of Our Mother's Garden, there is very little literature linking womanism to the lesbian and bisexual issue. Womanist theologian Renee Hill cites Christian influences as a source of the heterosexism and homophobia. Womanism was derived out of the idea that men are men, and women are white, and originally had little regard for queer women of color, because of the strong connection to the Black church. Black feminist critic Barbara Smith blames it on the Black community's reluctance to come to terms with homosexuality. On the other hand, there is an increase in the criticism of heterosexism within womanist scholarship. Christian womanist theologian Pamela R. Lightsey, in her book Our Lives Matter: A Womanist Queer Theology (2015), writes, \\"To many people, we are still perverts. To many, the Black pervert is the most dangerous threat to the American ideal. Because the Black conservative bourgeoisie has joined the attack on our personhood, Black LGBTQ persons cannot allow the discourse to be controlled such that our existence within the Black community is denied or made invisible.\\" An additional critique lies within the ambivalence of womanism. In Africana womanism and African womanism, the term is associated with black nationalist discourse and the separatist movement. Patricia Collins argues that this exaggerates racial differences by promoting homogeneous identity. This is a sharp contrast to the universalist model of womanism that is championed by Walker. The continued controversy and dissidence within the various ideologies of womanism serves only to draw attention away from the goal of ending race and gender-based oppression.

Duplex valve in wafer butterfly configuration. A butterfly valve is a valve that isolates or regulates the flow of a fluid. The closing mechanism is a disk that rotates. Principle of operation Operation is similar to that of a ball valve, which allows for quick shut off. Butterfly valves are generally favored because they cost less than other valve designs, and are lighter weight so they need less support. The disc is positioned in the center of the pipe. A rod passes through the disc to an actuator on the outside of the valve. Rotating the actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. Unlike a ball valve, the disc is always present within the flow, so it induces a pressure drop, even when open. A butterfly valve is from a family of valves called quarter-turn valves. In operation, the valve is fully open or closed when the disc is rotated a quarter turn. The \\"butterfly\\" is a metal disc mounted on a rod. When the valve is closed, the disc is turned so that it completely blocks off the passageway. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows an almost unrestricted passage of the fluid. The valve may also be opened incrementally to throttle flow. There are different kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the disc seat and body seal (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve the disc seat contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between disc and seat. In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal so that it can be machined such as to achieve a bubble tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.  Types  # Concentric butterfly valves – this type of valve has a resilient rubber seat with a metal disc. # Doubly-eccentric butterfly valves (high-performance butterfly valves or double-offset butterfly valves) – different type of materials is used for seat and disc. # Triply-eccentric butterfly valves (triple-offset butterfly valves) – the seats are either laminated or solid metal seat design. = Wafer-style butterfly valve = The wafer style butterfly valve is designed to maintain a seal against bi-directional pressure differential to prevent any backflow in systems designed for unidirectional flow. It accomplishes this with a tightly fitting seal; i.e., gasket, o-ring, precision machined, and a flat valve face on the upstream and downstream sides of the valve. = Lug-style butterfly valve = Lug-style valves have threaded inserts at both sides of the valve body. This allows them to be installed into a system using two sets of bolts and no nuts. The valve is installed between two flanges using a separate set of bolts for each flange. This setup permits either side of the piping system to be disconnected without disturbing the other side. A lug-style butterfly valve used in dead end service generally has a reduced pressure rating. For example, a lug-style butterfly valve mounted between two flanges has a pressure rating. The same valve mounted with one flange, in dead end service, has a rating. Lugged valves are extremely resistant to chemicals and solvents and can handle temperatures up to 200 °C, which makes it a versatile solution. = Rotary valve = Rotary valves constitute a derivation of the general butterfly valves and are used mainly in powder processing industries. Instead of being flat, the butterfly is equipped with pockets. When closed, it acts exactly like a butterfly valve and is tight. But when it is in the rotation, the pockets allow dropping a defined amount of solids, which makes the valve suitable for dosing bulk product by gravity. Such valves are usually of small size (less than 300 mm), pneumatically activated and rotate 180 degrees back and forth.  Use in industry  In the pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries, a butterfly valve is used to interrupt product flow (solid, liquid, gas) within the process. The valves used in these industries are usually manufactured according to cGMP guidelines (current good manufacturing practise). Butterfly valves generally replaced ball valves in many industries, particularly petroleum, due to lower cost and ease of installation, but pipelines containing butterfly valves cannot be 'pigged' for cleaning.  History  The butterfly valve has been in use since the late 18th century. James Watt used a butterfly valve in his steam engine prototypes. With advances in material manufacturing and technology, butterfly valves could be made smaller and withstand more-extreme temperatures. After World War II, synthetic rubbers were used in the sealer members, allowing the butterfly valve to be used in many more industries. In 1969 James E. Hemphill patented an improvement to the butterfly valve, reducing the hydrodynamic torque needed to change the output of the valve.

A tramway links the city's visitor information centre with the nearby Granite Island. Much of its route is over a causeway. The tramway is one of the very few horse-drawn tram routes remaining in public transit service anywhere in the world. It operates every day throughout the year except Christmas Day. Up to three double-decker tramcars are each hauled by a Clydesdale horse. The line is built to broad gauge, as were many of the early railways of South Australia. In October 2018, the Victor Harbor Horse Tram Authority was established as a subsidiary of the City of Victor Harbor to oversee the operations, business development and marketing of the service. History The South Australian Railways (SAR) reached Victor Harbor in 1864, when a pier adjacent to the railway station was constructed. In 1867 the pier was extended to reach Granite Island, the resulting link becoming known as a causeway, and a railway track was laid on it. The track continued on to and around the northern edge of the island to where a jetty was constructed. Although railway goods vehicles were routinely horse-hauled on this line, no passenger service operated until 1894. By then, increasing numbers of visitors and holiday makers were turning the causeway into a local attraction. The SAR decided to utilise a surplus double-deck horse-drawn tram to offer a passenger service. Subsequently, others followed. From the beginning of the 1900s George Honeyman contracted with the SAR to operate the passenger service. From 1940 his younger brother, Frank, took over until the line was closed in 1955 when the old working jetty and remnants of the Victoria Pier were being demolished by the Harbours Board. To strengthen the causeway for operation of the tram would have cost £3,000 but funds were not forthcoming and in 1954 the causeway was reconstructed without rails. The service continued to operate on Granite Island itself until 1956, when the cars were disposed of. Between 1956 and 1986 two rubber-tyred trailers towed by a small Ferguson tractor, later by a Land Rover with cladding to imitate the outline of a steam locomotive, provided a service with half the 32-person seating capacity of the tram cars. The 150th jubilee of South Australia was celebrated in 1986, and a fund was established for special projects to mark it. Reinstatement of the horse tramway was one such project. Four replica tram cars, each to carry 52 passengers, were built with tubular steel, timber cladding and roller bearings. Tracks were relaid and the service recommenced on 14 June 1986. In the 1990s rubber matting was installed on the causeway to assist the horses, of which there are 14 that each rotate on two three-hour shifts (of 3–4 trips) per week. One tram normally operates; two at busy times and at Easter, and three over the Christmas/New Year holiday period. In 2019, operations of the tram were suspended on New Year's Day after a pylon broke off the causeway and fell into the sea. After an urgent engineering assessment, major concerns were raised over the ageing causeway's ability to support the weight of the tramcars, and tram operations were again suspended on 23 January. The Horse Tram recommenced operation on 23 June 2019.

Mohiniyattam at Kannur district school kalothsavam 2019 Mohiniyattam, (), is one of the famous classical dances of India that developed and remained popular in the state of Kerala. Kathakali is another classical dance form of Kerala. Mohiniyattam dance gets its name from the word Mohini – a historical enchantress avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, who helps the good prevail over evil by developing her feminine powers. Mohiniyattam's roots, like all classical Indian dances, are in the Natya Shastra – the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text on performance arts. However, it follows the Lasya style described in Natya Shastra, that is a dance which is delicate, eros-filled and feminine. It is traditionally a solo dance performed by women after extensive training. The repertoire of Mohiniyattam includes music in the Carnatic style, singing and acting a play through the dance, where the recitation may be either by a separate vocalist or the dancer herself. The song is typically in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid called Manipravalam. The earliest mention of the word is found in the 16th- century legal text Vyavaharamala, but the likely roots of the dance are older. The dance was systematized in the 18th century, was ridiculed as a Devadasi prostitution system during the colonial British Raj, banned by a series of laws from 1931 through 1938, a ban that was protested and partially repealed in 1940. The socio-political conflict ultimately led to renewed interest, revival and reconstruction of Mohiniyattam by the people of Kerala, particularly the poet Vallathol Narayana Menon. Etymology Mythical Mohini. Mohiniyattam, also referred to as Mohini-attam, is derived from \\"Mohini\\" – a famous female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu in Indian mythology.Mohini Attam, Encyclopædia Britannica (2016) Mohini refers to a divine enchantress or a supreme seductress. She appears in Hindu mythologies during a battle between Devas (good) and Asuras (evil), after the evil had won control of Amrita (nectar of immortality). Appearing in her youthful bloom, dressed rapturously she uses her charms to seduce the Asuras, who seeking her favors, give her the Amrita to distribute among the evil forces. Mohini after gaining the Amrita gives it to the good instead, depriving the evil from gaining immortality. The details of the Mohini story varies by the Purana and region, but she is consistently an enchantress avatar of the supreme in Vaishnavism. Aattam is a Malayalam language word, and means rhythmic motion or dance. Mohiniyattam thus connotes \\"a dance of an enchantress, a beautiful woman\\". History Mohiniyattam. Mohiniyattam is a classical Indian dance, which by definition traces its repertoire to the foundational text Natya Shastra., Quote: \\"the Natyashastra remains the ultimate authority for any dance form that claims to be 'classical' dance, rather than 'folk' dance\\". The Natya Shastra text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The text describes the basic elements and the structure of two types of dance: the vigorous, high energy Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva) and the gentle, calmingly graceful Lāsyā dance (Parvati, Shiva's lover). Mohiniyāttam follows the structure and aims of the Lāsyā dance in Natya Shastra. According to Reginald Massey, Mohiniyattam's history is unclear. Kerala, the region where this dance genre developed and is popular, has a long tradition of lasya style dances whose basics and structure may be at the root. The earliest evidence of Mohiniyattam, or a Mohiniyattam-like dance tradition is found in temple sculpture of Kerala. The 11th century Vishnu temple at Trikodithanam, and the Kidangur Subramanya temple, have several sculptures of female dancers in Mohiniyattam pose. The textual evidence from 12th century onwards suggest that Malayalam poets and playwrights included Lāsyā themes. The 16th century Vyavaharamala by Nambootiri contains the first known mention of the term Mohiniyattam, in the context of a payment to be made to a Mohiniyattam dancer. Another text, Gosha Yatra, from the 17th century too mentions the term. The 18th century Balarama Bharatam, a major secondary work on Natya Shastra composed in Kerala, mentions many dance styles including Mohini Natana. In the 18th and 19th century, Mohiniyattam grew as dance arts received patronage of competing princely states. In particular, the early 19th century sponsorship and building of a joint Mohiniyattam and Bharatanatyam team of artists by the Hindu king, poet and music composer Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma contributed to the growth and systematization of modern Mohiniyattam. =Colonial era= With the spread of colonial British rule in the 19th century India, all classical dance forms of India were ridiculed and discouraged, leading to their severely decline. This was in part the result of the Victorian morality of sexual repressiveness along with Anglican missionaries who criticized Hinduism. A Mohiniattam pose The seductive gestures and facial expressions during temple dances were caricatured in The Wrongs of Indian Womanhood, published at the start of the 20th century, as evidence of \\"harlots, debased erotic culture, slavery to idols and priests\\" tradition, and Christian missionaries demanded that this must be stopped, launching the \\"anti-dance movement\\" or \\"anti-nautch movement\\" in 1892. This movement affected all classical dances in India and contributed to their decline, including the stigmatization of Mohiniyattam in the princely states of Travancore and Cochin in the British Empire. According to Justine Lemos, the conventional stereotype has been to label the temple dancers as prostitutes and that Mohiniyattam was banned by the Maharaja under pressure from the British rule and his citizens, but an examination of historical evidence suggests that neither did any law or proclamation ban Mohiniyattam nor is there any evidence that dancing girls of Mohiniyattam were devadasis, temple prostitutes or even menial servants of the temple. However, adds Lemos, there is evidence of rewards being given, scholarship being sponsored, and payments being made to the dancers of Mohiniyattam, as well as laws enacted between 1931 and 1938 that – without naming Mohiniyattam – banned devadasis, banned all forms of \\"lewd dance or theatre\\", and banned dancing in temples while the princely states of Kerala were part of the British Empire, in a manner similar to bans on Hindu performance arts in Madras, Bombay and Calcutta Presidencies enacted earlier. In 1940, the ban was partially repealed, by allowing \\"voluntary dances in temples\\". In 1941, a new law clarified that voluntary dance was permitted, but the dancers should never be paid. This led to protests, public riots and demands by dancers that performance art is a form of economic activity and religious freedom, that Mohiniyattam artists should be paid by the state or the audience, but the state did not pay them. Some women continued to dance Mohiniyattam in Hindu temples, regardless of the historic politics during the 1940s. =Modern era= The ridicule and bans enacted during the British colonial era contributed to nationalist sentiments, and impacted all Hindu performance arts including Mohiniyattam. It too was revived and reconstructed, particularly in the 1930s by the nationalist Malayalam poet Vallathol Narayana Menon, who helped repeal the ban on temple dancing in Kerala, as well as established the Kerala Kalamandalam dance school and encouraged Mohiniattam studies, training and practice. Other significant champions of Mohiniyattam in the 20th century have been Mukundraja, Krishna Panicker, Thankamony, as well as the guru and dancer Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma. Repertoire Expression of an artist Mohiniyattam is a lasya subgenre of dance, performed in the Kaisiki vritti (graceful style), as discussed in ancient Indian performance arts texts such as the Natya Shastra. More specifically, it is a dance that excels in Ekaharya Abhinaya form, that is a solo expressive dance performance aided by singing and music. The dance includes nritta (pure dance, solo), nritya (expressive dance, solo) and modern productions sometimes include natya (play, group dance): *The Nritta performance is abstract, rhythmic aspect of the dance that appears early and at the end of the dance repertoire. The viewer is presented with pure movement, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. An expressive gesture in Mohiniyattam. *The Nritya is the expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate a storyline, with emotions and feelings, with spiritual themes. In a nritya, the dance-acting (Abhinaya, Vaittari) expands to include silent expression of words through hand and facial gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The dancer articulates a legend or a spiritual message, aiming to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer. The basic posture of Mohiniyattam is parted feet, knees bent outwards, an erect upper torso, gentle 8-shape side to side swaying of body along with hips (Ati Bhanga). The footwork is soft, sliding and synchronous with the musical beat and acting. The body movement is sometimes described in terms of calming images of nature as the swinging of the palm leaves, and the gentle undulating of ocean waves. The basic dance units in Mohiniattam are known as atavus or atavukal, and these are grouped into four: Taganam, Jaganam, Dhaganam and Sammisram. The hand and facial gestures of the dance follow the classical text of Hastha Lakshanadeepika, which has elaborate description of mudras. =Sequence= The repertoire sequence of Mohiniyattam is similar to that of Bharatanatyam, so of contains seven items that are performed to a structure described in classical dance texts: Cholkettu (invocation, but starts with offering reverence to a goddess Bhagavati and ends with a prayer to Shiva), Jatisvaram or more precisely Swarajeti, Varnam (a play wherein she embeds a mimicry for distraction while communicating the underlying story or message), Padam (song), Tillana (dancer's interpretation of melody the musician create), Shlokam and Saptam. =Costumes= Mohiniyattam costumes. The costume includes plain white or off-white such as ivory or cream colored sari embroidered with bright golden or gold laced colored brocade (similar to a ceremonial Kasavu saree). She wears a fitted choli (blouse) matching the sari, below which at the waist is a golden belt which tucks in the end of the sari, and highlights the waist. In front of the saree, below the belt is pleated sheet with concentric bands in gold or saffron colors, which allow freedom of movement and assist in visually communicating the mudra to distant audience. The dancer wears relatively simple jewelry and no masks, in contrast to the other major classical dance of Kerala called Kathakali. Her jewelry typically includes items on fingers, wrists, neck and ears (which may have bells). The face makeup is natural, but lips are brilliant red, she has the Hindu tikka (Gobi) on her forehead and her eyes are lined to help prominently highlight the eye movements during the dance. Her ankles are adorned with leather straps with bells (chilanka), feet and fingers colored red with natural dyes. Her hairdo is gathered and tied into a smooth tight round chignon on one side of her head (typically left) and the bun then ringed with fragrant flowers (typically jasmine mulla). =Music and instruments= The vocals (music) of Mohiniyattam involves various rhythms. There are numerous compositions for a Mohiniyattam repertoire, most of whose lyrics are in Manipravalam, a mixture of Sanskrit, Tamil and Malayalam. The musical instruments usually used in Mohiniyattam are Mridangam or Madhalam (barrel drum), Idakka (hour glass drum), flute, Veena, and Kuzhitalam (cymbals). The ragas (melody) are rendered in the sopana (steps) style, which is a slow melodic style with roots in the Natya Shastra.

The lake is fed by the Wood River but seasonal water relatively flattened the terrain, and as such results in significant mudflats. A Migratory Bird Sanctuary was established at the lake on March 9, 1925. This lake, in conjunction with Reed Lake and Chaplin Lake, forms a site of hemispheric importance in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network. It was designated in April 1997, and is \\"one of the most important inland sites for migratory birds in North America\\". A variety of First Nations oral traditions explain the origin of the lake's name. At various times during the lake's human history, it has attracted interest from several First Nations tribes, duck hunters, military trainers, sodium sulfate producers, conservationists and birdwatchers. A town of the same name (Old Wives) is located north of the lake on Highway 363. Name According to a Cree tradition recounted by Métis guides accompanying the North West Mounted Police in 1874, sometime around 1840 a band of Cree hunters followed a herd of bison into Blackfoot territory and made camp near the lake. Blackfoot scouts discovered this band and attacked. Although the Cree were able to defend themselves, they anticipated an attack by a larger Blackfoot war party the next morning. The older women volunteered to stay behind to tend the fires through the night in the hope of fooling the Blackfoot into believing that they were not abandoning their camp to escape. Using this diversion as cover, the rest of the Cree successfully fled back to their home territory in the Qu'Appelle valley. When the Blackfoot arrived that morning they found only the old women, whom the Blackfoot killed in vengeance. This commonly recited version of the lake's naming has been commemorated by a historical marker situated beside Highway 2 near the lake. A variant telling of this narrative states that the Blackfoot warriors were so impressed by the women's courage that they left them alone and allowed them to rejoin their own people. Another First Nations oral tradition describes how a band of Assiniboine fleeing from pursuing Blackfoot warriors abandoned the old women in their band who could not keep pace with everyone else. The women continued their effort to escape by wading across the lake. However, they misjudged the water's depth and drowned. An Assiniboine tradition associates the name with a battle which occurred at the lake around the beginning of the 19th century in which Assiniboines vanquished their Blackfoot enemies. According to some First Nations traditions, the spirits of the dead women continue to haunt a small island in the lake from which their voices can be heard at night. Some early accounts describing the region state that the name \\"Old Wives Lake\\" was originally applied to both the lake that currently bears that name and to nearby Chaplin Lake. Isaac Cowie writes, \\"There are two Old Wives' Lakes, connected by a creek. These were named on maps, respectively, after the Rt. Hon. Henry Chaplin and Sir Frederick Johnstone, who hunted buffalo near them in 1861.\\" \\"[Old Wives Lake] is divided into two parts, each of which is about twenty miles long. The two divisions are united by a sluggish stream, about ten miles in length, into which Old Wives' Creek empties.\\" In 1861, the British politicians Sir Frederick Johnstone and Henry Chaplin visited the area to hunt bison, antelope and elk for sport. Explorer John Rae, who accompanied the expedition, named area lakes in honor of its members: The lake now called Old Wives Lake became Johnstone Lake and Chaplin Lake received the name by which it is still known. Although the Canadian government officially adopted the designation \\"Johnstone Lake\\" in 1886; the First Nations peoples along with early ranchers and homesteaders in the area continued to refer to it as Old Wives Lake. In response to a petition by area residents to restore its traditional name, the Canadian board on geographical names formally renamed it Old Wives Lake in 1953. History Tipi rings and other artifacts discovered near Old Wives Lake attest to a First Nations presence in the area long predating their contact with Europeans. With the arrival of European settlers, ranchers and homesteaders occupied the area surrounding the lake. Until hunting was prohibited in the Old Wives Lake bird sanctuary, duck hunters gathered at the lake in the autumn to hunt the plentiful wild ducks and geese. During World War II a bombing and gunnery air training school established under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan operated near the lake's shoreline, three miles east of Mossbank. Throughout the war, part of the lake and its surroundings were incorporated into a 23-mile bombing range used by trainee pilots. For some decades in the 20th century, especially during the 1950s and 1960s, sodium sulfate was harvested from the lake by diverting water into nearby Frederick Lake for evaporation. The sodium sulfate plant operated until 1977. In 1975, two Canadian Forces military training aircraft were involved in a mid-air collision over the lake which caused one of the aircraft to crash into it. The two pilots in this aircraft were able to parachute out and inflate emergency rubber dinghies enabling them to remain afloat until their rescue by a helicopter based out of CFB Moose Jaw. The lake is currently a popular destination for birdwatchers; a 2.4 kilometer walking trail has been constructed along the lake's south shore, along with viewing and picnic areas. Drought conditions caused the lake to dry up completely in 1937 and 1988. In certain years, including 1951, 1959, 1980 and 1997, large numbers of ducks were found dead at the lake due to outbreaks of botulism.

It seeks to use the Wick rotation to describe the force of gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics.  Introduction in layperson's terms  =The Wick rotation= In physics, a Wick rotation, named after Gian-Carlo Wick, is a method of finding a solution to dynamics problems in n dimensions, by transposing their descriptions in n + 1 dimensions, by trading one dimension of space for one dimension of time. More precisely, it substitutes a mathematical problem in Minkowski space into a related problem in Euclidean space by means of a transformation that substitutes an imaginary-number variable for a real-number variable. It is called a rotation because when complex numbers are represented as a plane, the multiplication of a complex number by i is equivalent to rotating the vector representing that number by an angle of \\\\pi/2 radians about the origin. For example, a Wick rotation could be used to relate a macroscopic event temperature diffusion (like in a bath) to the underlying thermal movements of molecules. If we attempt to model the bath volume with the different gradients of temperature we would have to subdivide this volume into infinitesimal volumes and see how they interact. We know such infinitesimal volumes are in fact water molecules. If we represent all molecules in the bath by only one molecule in an attempt to simplify the problem, this unique molecule should walk along all possible paths that the real molecules might follow. The path integral formulation is the conceptual tool used to describe the movements of this unique molecule, and Wick rotation is one of the mathematical tools that are very useful to analyse a path integral problem. =Application in quantum mechanics= In a somewhat similar manner, the motion of a quantum object as described by quantum mechanics implies that it can exist simultaneously in different positions and have different speeds. It differs clearly to the movement of a classical object (e.g. a billiard ball), since in this case a single path with precise position and speed can be described. A quantum object does not move from A to B with a single path, but moves from A to B by all ways possible at the same time. According to the Feynman path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the path of the quantum object is described mathematically as a weighted average of all those possible paths. In 1966 an explicitly gauge invariant functional-integral algorithm was found by DeWitt, which extended Feynman's new rules to all orders. What is appealing in this new approach is its lack of singularities when they are unavoidable in general relativity. Another operational problem with general relativity is the computational difficulty, because of the complexity of the mathematical tools used. Path integrals in contrast have been used in mechanics since the end of the nineteenth century and is well known. In addition, the path-integral formalism is used both in classical and quantum physics so it might be a good starting point for unifying general relativity and quantum theories. For example, the quantum-mechanical Schrödinger equation and the classical heat equation are related by Wick rotation. So the Wick relation is a good tool to relate a classical phenomenon to a quantum phenomenon. The ambition of Euclidean quantum gravity is to use the Wick rotation to find connections between a macroscopic phenomenon, gravity, and something more microscopic.  More rigorous treatment Euclidean quantum gravity refers to a Wick rotated version of quantum gravity, formulated as a quantum field theory. The manifolds that are used in this formulation are 4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds instead of pseudo Riemannian manifolds. It is also assumed that the manifolds are compact, connected and boundaryless (i.e. no singularities). Following the usual quantum field-theoretic formulation, the vacuum to vacuum amplitude is written as a functional integral over the metric tensor, which is now the quantum field under consideration. :\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{g}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi\\\\, \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\int d^4x \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{g}}(R+\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{matter})\\\\right) where φ denotes all the matter fields. See Einstein–Hilbert action. Relation to ADM formalism Euclidean Quantum Gravity does relate back to ADM formalism used in canonical quantum gravity and recovers the Wheeler–DeWitt equation under various circumstances. If we have some matter field \\\\phi, then the path integral reads :Z = \\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{g}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi\\\\, \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\int d^4x \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{g}}(R+\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{matter})\\\\right) where integration over \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{g} includes an integration over the three-metric, the lapse function N, and shift vector N^{a}. But we demand that Z be independent of the lapse function and shift vector at the boundaries, so we obtain :\\\\frac{\\\\delta Z}{\\\\delta N}=0=\\\\int \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\mathbf{g}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\phi\\\\, \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\delta S}{\\\\delta N}\\\\right_{\\\\Sigma} \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\int d^4x \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{g}}(R+\\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\mathrm{matter})\\\\right) where \\\\Sigma is the three-dimensional boundary. Observe that this expression vanishes implies the functional derivative vanishes, giving us the Wheeler–DeWitt equation. A similar statement may be made for the diffeomorphism constraint (take functional derivative with respect to the shift functions instead).  References  * Bryce S.

Five Finger Rapids seen from Klondike Highway Carmacks Store at the service station in Stewart Crossing The Klondike Highway is a highway that runs from the Alaska Panhandle through the province of British Columbia and the territory of Yukon in Canada, linking the coastal town of Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon. Its route somewhat parallels the route used by prospectors in the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush. In both British Columbia and Yukon, the highway is marked as Yukon Highway 2\\\\. In Alaska, the Highway is marked as Alaska Route 98 (as in \\"route of 1898\\").An illustrated mile-by-mile guide by ExploreNorth Until 1978, the unopened section between the Yukon–BC border and Carcross had no official highway number, while the section north of Carcross to the Alaska Highway was Highway 5, and the section from Stewart Crossing to Dawson was Highway 3\\\\. The BC section is now maintained by the Yukon government as a natural extension of Highway 2\\\\. Route description The Klondike Highway winds in the state of Alaska for , up through the White Pass in the Coast Mountains where it crosses the Canada–US border to British Columbia (BC) for , then enters Yukon where it reaches the Alaska Highway near Whitehorse and shares a short section with that highway until north of Whitehorse, where it diverges once more to Dawson City. The highway is long. History =South Klondike Highway= The original section known locally as the Carcross Road was actually made into a part of the Alaska Highway in 1942, until the Marsh Lake route was opened the next year. As Yukon Highway 5, it formed a loop road with Highway 6, the Tagish Road (now numbered as 8). It was renumbered as Highway 2 in 1978, being incorporated into the Klondike Highway designation. The road underwent alignment improvements during the 1980s. Residents living as far south as from the Alaska Highway still give their residential addresses as historic mile measurements that start at zero at the Alaska Highway, even though the distances are no longer accurate, and kilometre posts count distance from Skagway's ferry terminal. Construction of the \\"Carcross-Skagway Road\\" began in the 1950s, was abandoned partway up a mountain from Skagway, resumed in 1976-1977 and was completed between Skagway and Carcross in August 1978. It was only open for a few weeks before seasonal closure. The first full summer season of use was in 1979. The highway originally was built for tourist traffic, but in 1986 became important as a commercial transportation route, coincident with what seemed to be inevitable abandonment of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway (WP&YR;). The new owners of the Faro mine secured government agreement to open the highway for trucking. The last winter closure ended in the spring of 1986. The Carcross-Skagway Road portion of the highway underwent substantial rerouting, widening and (cold mix) paving in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mining ore trucks and fuel tankers are the primary current (2013) commercial users of the highway, which also remains a popular tourist route (cars, RVs, buses), and provides a means for the WP&YR; to offer economically-priced train excursions connecting at Fraser to buses based at Skagway for the cruise ship industry, or to/from Carcross and Whitehorse to the north. =North Klondike Highway= The quality of roads from Whitehorse to Dawson City prior to 1950 was poor and only for the hardiest of travelers and motorized vehicles. The \\"Whitehorse-Mayo Road,\\" Yukon's original Highway 2, extended along today's route from Whitehorse to Stewart Crossing, then turned northeast to Mayo, Elsa and Keno City. The last of three bridges was finished in 1960 to replace ferries at Carmacks, Pelly Crossing and Stewart Crossing. Yukon's original Highway 3, the Dawson-Mayo Road, was opened in September 1955 between Stewart Crossing and Dawson City. The Dawson-Mayo Road became part of Highway 2 in 1978 and was named the Klondike Highway, while the road northeast from Stewart Crossing became Highway 11, and was later named the Silver Trail. Even as of 1979, the entire Klondike Highway was gravel, but by 1982, some paving had been laid down as far north as Carmacks. Rebuilding and some rerouting was completed in the late 1980s. Approximately, the first of the North Klondike Highway are still often known as the Mayo Road to the residents of Whitehorse. Although kilometric distance markers have been in place since the early 1980s, residents in this area still identify their residential address as a mile measurement along the Mayo Road.

It was inspired in part by Lode Runner, Soldat, and other side-scrolling games. It was the first of the N series, followed by N+ and N++. N won the audience choice award in the downloadables category of the 2005 Independent Games Festival.  Gameplay  In N, the player controls a ninja who navigates tile- based levels while simultaneously avoiding hazards, collecting gold, and eventually opening an exit door which completes the level. Gameplay involves four keys—a move-left key (default left arrow), a move-right key (default right arrow), jumping (default shift key, though z key is a common alternative), and suicide (default k key). Combinations of moving and jumping on various types of terrain allow the ninja to perform a variety of movements, such as jumping from wall to wall, climbing up vertical inclines, and sliding down steep surfaces. Version 1.4 of N contains 100 episodes (numbered 00 to 99), while version 2.0 contains 120 episodes (due to two bonus columns being unlockable after the completion of the main game episodes). Each episode in all iterations of the game features five levels (numbered 0 to 4). N also supports user-made levels. This is done through a built-in level editor called NEd, or the \\"N Editor\\". Levels can be added into a game by modifying a text file accompanying the game that contains user level data. N 1.4 has a total of 500 maps, 450 of which are made by Metanet Software; 2.0 contains 600 levels, 500 of which are made by Metanet Software. The remaining 50 levels in 1.4 are aforementioned user levels that were hand-picked by Metanet in 2005, while the remaining 100 levels in 2.0 were user-made levels selected by a panel of fans in late 2012 and were finalized by Metanet Software in 2013. (The team behind the shortlist selection were listed in the game's credits under their respective aliases.) The goal of each level is to trigger the switch and exit through the door it opens within the time limit. Some levels have more than one exit and associated switch, giving the player more freedom to decide their route and method of completing the map. Each episode is given a cumulative time limit. At the beginning of level 0, the player is given 90 seconds to complete the next five levels. The episode's time limit can be increased by collecting gold, which adds two seconds per piece. The time left at the end of each level carries over to the next level. The only exception is the final level, in which the time left becomes that episode's score.  Development  Five years after N 1.4 release, on June 1, 2010, Metanet Software announced on the Forums and on the Metablog that they were going to definitely start with N 1.5. They created some threads in the forums that discussed every new aspect of the new version of N, asking for the players feedback, and asking the players their opinions. In December 2011, a demo of the N v2.0 beta was released in the form of a \\"contesque\\". Players who ranked highly in each section were awarded with prize packs, including T-shirts, N+ download codes, stickers, buttons and more. On January 1, 2013, version 2.0 was released as a full beta, complete with a new physics engine written in ActionScript 3.0. The official release added a plethora of new episodes and bonus content and minor bug fixes; it is also the final free release for PC. Approximately two and a half years later, in late July 2015, N++ was released on PlayStation 4 to critical acclaim; it has since been released on Windows, OS X, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

The final part of the saga, which was likely composed separately from and later than the rest , is used as a source for Swedish medieval history. The saga may be most appreciated for its memorable imagery, as seen in a quote from one of its translators, Nora Kershaw Chadwick, on the invasion of the Horde: The text contains several poetic sections: the Hervararkviða, on Hervor's visit to her father's grave and retrieval of the sword Tyrfing; another, the Hlöðskviða, on the battle between Goths and Huns; and a third, containing the riddles of Gestumblindi. It has inspired later writers and derivative works, such as J. R. R. Tolkien when shaping his legends of Middle-earth.

Description Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks (The Saga of Hervör and Heidrek) is a legendary saga known from 13th- and 14th-century parchment sources, plus additional 17th-century paper manuscripts that complete the story. =Manuscripts= Orvar-Odd and Hjalmar bid each other farewell Mårten Eskil Winge (1866). There are two main manuscript sources for the text, dating to the 14th and 15th centuries, often referred to as H and R, respectively. H, the Hauksbók (AM 544) dates to 1325; R (MS 2845) dates to the 15th century; once held at the Danish Royal Library at Copenhagen, it is now held by the Stofnun Árna Magnússonar in Reykjavík.http://fasnl.ku.dk/browse- manuscripts/manuscript.aspx?sid=RwBLAFMAIAAyADgANAA1ACAANAB0AG8A0. In its present, fragmentary state, H tells the story up to the end of Gestumblindi's second riddle, whereas R is truncated before the end of Ch. 12, that is within the poem on the battle of Goths and Huns. There is a third version, often referred to as U, from 17th-century paper manuscript (R 715) held at the University Library in Uppsala. The version is very garbled, and includes corrections sourced from other sagas, including from the Rímur reworking of the same tale, the Hervarar Rímur. An additional 17th-century manuscript (AM 203fol) held at the Copenhagen University Library contains a copy of R, but then continues with text from another unknown source, thought to share a common ancestor with U. There are also copied versions written down in the late 17th century; whereas the two early versions are on parchment, these later versions are on paper. These include AM 192, AM 193, AM 202 k, AM 354 4to, AM 355 4to, and AM 359 a 4to. These the 17th century paper manuscripts are thought to add nothing to the texts already known from H and R, though they continue the story where the two older versions end, and fill in lacunas. Two manuscripts, (AM 281 4to) and (AM 597b) help complete the 'H' (Hausbók) version, being copies. used the 1694 text (AM 345) in preparing his edition of the saga. There are significant differences between R and H: R misses the first chapter and some riddles, as well as having a different sequence from H. Scholarly opinion differs as to which presents the best form of the text. The least altered version is thought to be the 'R' text. A slightly different version of the stemma has been reconstructed by Alaric Hall, from that originally proposed by - both propose a (lost) version from which both parchment and the paper versions descend. =Content and analysis= The saga tells the history of the family of Hervör and Heidrek over several generations. It begins with Guthmund, a mythic tale; then the story turns to the sons of Arngrim, a Viking Age tale also told in the Hyndluljóð; next, the tale tells of Hervor, daughter of Angantyr; then to Heithrik son of Hervor -at this point the setting of the tale changes from to the Kingdom of the Goths, somewhere in eastern Europe ( 4th–5th century); finally, the tale returns to the historically later date. considers that the latter part of the tale, among the Huns and Goths, has a separate origin to the earlier parts, and, in actual chronological time, is actually taking place several centuries earlier. All the different manuscripts show a similar pattern, with (a maximum of) seven sections, four of which are poetry. identifies seven key events: 1. introduction with the forging of the sword, Tyrfingr; 2. A holmganga (duel) between Örvar-Oddr and Hjálmarr, and Angantýr and his brothers, with Angantýr killed and buried with the sword; 3. (with the poem Hervarakviða) Hervör reviving her dead father Angantýr and retrieving the sword Tyrgingr; 4. the tale of Heiðrekr son of Hervör, new wielder of Tyrfingr; 5. and his killing following a riddle-contest (a gátur presented in poem form) with Óðinn; 6. war between Heiðrekr's sons Angantýr and Hlöðr (including the poem Hlöðskviða); 7. an epilogue listing the kingly descendants of Angantýr. The 6th and final parts are partially lost or absent in manuscripts 'H' and 'R', but are found in the 17th-century paper manuscripts. The common link through all the tales is the sword (Tyrfing) passed between generations - this magic sword shares a common trope with some other mythological weapons in that it cannot be sheathed once drawn until it has drawn blood. (e.g., see also Dáinsleif, or Bodvar Bjarki's sword in Hrolf Kraki's Saga) There are three poems in the text, one romantic, one gnomic, one heroic. The gnomic The Riddles of Gestumblindi, is a good example of riddling from early Norse literature; the other two poems are considered very good examples of the type: one concerns the dialogue between Hervor and Angantyr at the barrows at Samso; the other describes the battle between Huns and Goths. In addition to attempts to understand the relationship between the events in the saga and real world historical characters, events, and places (see § Historicity) the manuscripts and contents are also of interest in research into the attitudes and cultures of the periods in which they were composed or written down. Hall thinks the text derives ultimately from oral tradition, not from the invention of an author. thinks the poem Hervararkviða (or 'The Waking of Angantyr') was composed specifically for a narrative closely akin to the tale told in Heiðreks saga, as it is consistent in style, and, forms a consistent narrative link between events in the tale. considers it unequivocally older than the saga itself. What exactly was the original underpinning narrative for the poem is a matter of scholarly debate. The section of the saga concerning Heidrek's disregard for his father's advice is common to a widely known family of tales (called by Knut Liestøl \\"The Good Counsels of the Father\\") - in general there are three counsels - and in the saga a set of three (1st, 2nd, and 6th) fit together. Tolkien proposes that after the counsellings aspect of the tale was introduced into the work, further counsels were added, further extending that theme through the saga. The poem Hlöðskviða (or \\"Battle of the Goths and Huns\\") has numerous analogues that overlap in topical coverage - the oldest of these is thought to be the English Widsith. Some parts of the poetry in 'Heiðreks saga' also appear in variant forms in Örvar-Odd's saga (lines 97–9, 103-6), and the outline story appears in books 5 and 6 of the Gesta Danorum. There are also elemental plot similarities between the saga and Sturlaugs saga starfsama up to the point a protagonist receives the magic sword via a female figure - Hall surmises that the two may have shared a narrative origin. considers that the poem, though seemingly considerably altered over time, once formed part of a continuous poetic narrative that gave a complete description of the Goth-Hun conflict, which existed as a separate work. =Historicity of \\"The Battle of the Goths and Huns\\"= In the 17th century, when the Norse sagas became a subject of interest to scholars they were initially taken as reasonably accurate depictions of historical events. Later in the 19th and 20th century it was realized that they were not completely historically accurate. considered that the battle between Goths and Huns was a legendary retelling of the battle between the Gothic king Ostrogotha and the Gepid king Fastida, which was described by Jordanes in Ch.17 of his history of the Goths. in his analysis in Ueber die Hervararsaga suggested the battle described was the same as the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (AD 451), identifying Angantyr as the Roman general Aetius and Hlothr as the Frankish Chlodio, with the incorporation of parts of the general Litorius, whereas the Vandal Geiseric is the prototype for Gizurr Grytingalithi. proposed alternative attributions for the battles - to one recorded by Paul the Deacon that took place between the Langobards and the Vulgares Bulgars: one in which Agelmundus (Agelmund) was killed, and his sister (conflated to Hervor) is taken prisoner, the other in which new Langobardian king Lamissio is victorious - this is conflated with the battle of the Goths and Huns by Much - Much also identifies the region of the battles to be north of the Carpathian/river Danube area, near modern Krakov. In the latter half of the 19th century Heinzel's theory was predominant and widely accepted. Later Gustav Neckel and Gudmund Schütte further analysed the textual and historical information: Neckel placed the events after the death of Attila (d.453) during the later Gepid-Hun conflicts, whereas Schutte identified either Heithrekr or Heathoric as transformations of the name of the Gepid king Ardaric; in the early 1900s Henrik Schück and Richard Constant Boer both rejected Heinzel's attribution and a link with Attila - Schück split the legends of the strife between brothers and the Goth- Hun war, placing each separately, and identified the location of places to be in southern Russia, whereas Boer associated the Dunheithr with the Daugava River, but placed the battle further north in central European Russia, in the Valdai Hills. Further scholarship in the 20th century returned further name and place attributions, with Otto von Friesen and Arwid Johannson returning to the western end of the Carpathians; Hermann Schnedier proposing the Goths in the Black Sea area (Crimean Goths); and N. Lukman re-analysing the tale, not in the context of Jordanes' history, but from that of Ammianus Marcellinus - under this interpretation the date now shifted to 386, where a mass migration of peoples under Odotheus (conflated to Hlothr) was destroyed by the Romans on the Danube - in Lukman's reconstruction Heithrekr is the visigothic Athanaric. In an analysis of parts of the tale, identifies the place where Angantyr revenges his father's (Heithrekr) killing by slaves as being at the feet of the Carpathian Mountains, using linguistic analysis based on consonant shifts (see Grimm's law) on the term \\"Harvath Mountains\\"; the place Árheimar in Danparstathir mentioned in association is unidentified, though \\"Danpar-\\" has been assumed to be some form of the river Dneiper. Similarities with the Battle of Nedao (AD 454) have also been noted. It is a testimony to its great age that names appear in genuinely Germanic forms and not in any form remotely influenced by Latin. Names for Goths appear that stopped being used after 390, such as Grýting (cf. the Latin form Greutungi) and Tyrfing (cf. the Latin form Tervingi). The events take place where the Goths lived during the wars with the Huns. The Gothic capital Árheimar is located on the Dniepr (...á Danparstöðum á þeim bæ, er Árheimar heita...), King Heidrek dies in the Horvatya (White Croatia) (...und Harvaða fjöllum) and the Battle with the Huns takes place on the plains of the Danube (...á vígvöll á Dúnheiði í Dylgjudölum). The mythical Myrkviðr [Mirkwood] which separates the Goths from the Huns appears to correspond to Maeotian marshes. Synopsis Hervor's death Peter Nicolai Arbo The saga deals with the sword Tyrfing and how it was forged and cursed by the Dwarves Dvalinn and Durin for king Svafrlami. Later, he lost it to the berserker Arngrim from Bolmsö who gave it to his son Angantyr. Angantyr died during a fight on Samsø against the Swedish hero Hjalmar, whose friend Orvar-Odd buried the cursed sword in a barrow together with Angantyr. From the barrow it was retrieved by Angantyr's daughter, the shieldmaiden Hervor who summoned her dead father to claim her inheritance. Then the saga continues with her and her son Heidrek, the king of Reidgotaland. Heiðrekr is killed after a riddle contest with Óðinn. Between his sons Angantyr and Hlod, there is a great battle about their father's heritage and Hlod is aided by the Huns. However, Hlod is defeated and killed. In the end, the saga relates that Angantyr had the son who was king of Reidgotaland for a long time. Heiðrekr's daughter was Hildr and she had the son Halfdan the Valiant, who was the father of Ivar Vidfamne. After Ivar Vidfamne follows a list of Swedish kings, both real and semi-legendary, ending with Philip Halstensson, but this was probably composed separately from the rest of the saga and integrated with it in later redactions. Influence, legacy, and adaptions Örvar-Oddr informs Ingeborg about Hjalmar's death August Malmström (1859) A key scene in the later medieval Ormars rímur, in which the hero awakens his father from the dead to retrieve his sword, was probably inspired by Hervararkviða.Haukur Þorgeirsson, 'Hljóðkerfi og bragkerfi: Stoðhljóð, tónkvæði og önnur úrlausnarefni í íslenskri bragsögu ásamt útgáfu á Rímum af Ormari Fraðmarssyn' (Ph.D. thesis, University of Iceland, 2013), p. 271. A Faroese ballad, Gátu ríma ('riddle poem') was collected in the nineteenth century that is thought by some scholars to derive from the riddle-contest in the saga. =Hickes' \\"The Waking of Angantyr\\"= At the beginning of the 18th century George Hickes published a translation of the Hervararkviða in his thesaurus (the Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archæologicus) - working from , with the aid of a Swedish scholar, he presented the entire poem in half line verse similar to that used in Old English poetry (see Old English metre) - it was the first full Icelandic poem translated to English, and contributed to interest within England in such works. The work was reprinted in Dryden's Poetical Miscellanies (1716), and by Thomas Percy in amended form as \\"The Incantation of Hervor\\" in his Five Pieces of Runic Poetry (1763). Hicke's publication inspired various 'gothic' and 'runic odes' based on the poem, of varying quality and faithfulness to the original. states \\"[T]he cult of the ubiquitous eighteenth-century poem known as 'The Waking of Angantyr' can be traced directly to its door\\". =Other adaptions= The Hervararkviða poem was translated fairly closely into verse by Beatrice Barmby and included in her Gísli Súrsson: a Drama (1900); and into a more 'olde English' style by in The Norse King's Bridal. Hjálmar's Death-Song was translated by W. Herbert in his Select Icelandic Poetry. The French poet Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle adapted the Hervararkviða in the poem \\"L’Épée d’Angantyr\\" [Angantyr's sword] in his Poemes barbares. =J. R. R. Tolkien= There is much in this saga that readers of J. R. R. Tolkien's work will recognize, most importantly the riddle contest. There are for instance warriors similar to the Rohirrim, brave shieldmaidens, Mirkwood, haunted barrows yielding enchanted swords (see Barrow-downs), a mithril mailcoat, an epic battle, and two Dwarves named Dwalin and Durin.

He served in the House of Commons of Canada for thirteen years, and was a candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1953. Ross was born in Lyleton, Manitoba, the son of John Alexander Ross and Jessie Mary Sellar, and was educated in Melita and at the Manitoba Agricultural College. He enlisted as a soldier in World War I, served in France, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. After the war, he worked as a farmer and served as reeve of Arthur municipality for twelve years. He was also an active Freemason. In 1930, Ross married Hilda Morrison. Ross ran as a candidate of the Manitoba Conservative Party in the southwestern riding of Arthur for the provincial elections of 1927, 1932 and 1936. He was defeated on all three occasions by candidates of the governing Progressive Party (known after 1932 as the Liberal-Progressive Party). In 1940, Ross was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Souris, narrowly defeating Liberal candidate George William McDonald. He was re-elected by a wider margin in 1945, and once again by a narrow margin in 1949. He remained an MP until 1953, serving for the entire time in the opposition Progressive Conservative caucus. Ross retired from federal politics in 1953, after his riding was eliminated by redistribution. Ross returned to provincial politics for the 1953 provincial election, and was elected for Arthur on his fourth attempt. He defeated John R. Pitt, who had also been his opponent in 1936. The Manitoba Progressive Conservatives were in a state of transformation during the early 1950s. From 1940 to 1950, they had been part of a coalition government with the Liberal-Progressives. This coalition ended soon after Douglas Campbell became premier in 1948, and the Progressive Conservatives were struggling to re-define themselves as the \\"government in waiting\\". The Conservatives had been led since 1936 by Errick Willis, a figure from the party's rural base who was a prominent cabinet minister in the coalition years. Willis had been an ineffective campaigner in the 1953 election, and many Conservatives (including Ross) believed that new leadership would be needed for an electoral breakthrough. In October 1953, Willis bowed to internal pressure and called a leadership convention for the following year. Willis announced that he would stand for re-election; Ross and Dufferin Roblin also declared themselves as candidates. Ross was unskilled at province-wide campaigning, and was unable to develop an organization comparable with those of Willis and Roblin. He was also damaged by reports that he and other MLAs were preparing to start a new party if Willis was re-elected. Ross finished third on the first ballot, with 55 votes. Most of his supporters went to Roblin, who won on the second ballot. Ross died in Melita just before the election of 1958.

She did become the world's first licensed female pilot on 8 March 1910. She received the 36th aeroplane pilot's licence issued by the Aeroclub de France, the world's first organization to issue pilot licences. At the time, pilot licences were only required for pilots operating aircraft for commercial purposes. Early life Born on 22 August 1882 in Paris, France, as Elise Raymonde Deroche, Raymonde De Laroche was the daughter of a plumber. She had a fondness for sports as a child, as well as for motorcycles and automobiles when she was older. As a young woman she became an actress and used the stage name \\"Raymonde de Laroche\\". Inspired by Wilbur Wright's 1908 demonstrations of powered flight in Paris and being personally acquainted with several aviators, including artist-turned-aviator Léon Delagrange, who was reputed to be the father of her son André, de Laroche determined to take up flying for herself. also Leslie was Raymonde de Laroche's best friend. Achievements in aviation Raymonde de Laroche in her Voisin aeroplane in 1909 In October 1909, de Laroche appealed to her friend, aviator and aeroplane builder Charles Voisin, to instruct her in how to fly. On 22 October 1909, de Laroche went to the Voisin brothers' base of operations at Chalons, east of Paris. Voisin's aircraft could seat only one person, so she operated the plane by herself while he stood on the ground and gave instructions. After she mastered taxiing around the airfield, she lifted off and flew . De Laroche's flight is often cited as the first by a woman in a powered heavier-than-air craft; there is evidence that two other women, P. Van Pottelsberghe and Thérèse Peltier, had flown the previous year with Henri Farman and Delagrange respectively as passengers but not as pilots.Early Aviators – Peltier Biography Decades later, aviation journalist Harry Harper wrote that until de Laroche made her celebrated flight on the Voisin, she had only flown once, for a short hop, as a passenger; when she first took the controls, Charles Voisin expressly forbade her to attempt a flight; and after taxiing twice across the airfield, she took off, flying \\"ten or fifteen feet high\\" and handling the controls with \\"cool, quick precision\\".Air Trails, July 1953. \\"The Brave Baroness – First Licensed Ladybird\\" by Harry Harper. Although Gabriel Voisin wrote, \\"... my brother [was] entirely under her thumb\\",Voisin, G.: Mes 10000 Cerfs-Volants. Editions Table Ronde, 1960. . the story of de Laroche as a headstrong woman making the flight after scant preparation and against Voisin's orders almost certainly romanticises what actually took place. Flight magazine, a week after the flight, reported: \\"For some time the Baroness has been taking lessons from M. Chateau, the Voisin instructor, at Chalons, and on Friday of last week she was able to take the wheel for the first time. This initial voyage into the air was only a very short one, and terra firma was regained after .\\"Flight, page 695, 30 October 1909. Flight was also responsible for bestowing the title \\"Baroness\\" upon de Laroche, as she was not of noble birth. Flight added that on the following day she circled the flying field twice, \\"the turnings being made with consummate ease. During this flight of about four miles (6 km) there was a strong gusty wind blowing, but after the first two turnings the Baroness said that it did not bother her, as she had the machine completely under control.\\" On 8 March 1910, de Laroche became the first woman in the world to receive a pilot licence when the Aero- Club of France issued her licence #36 of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (International Aeronautics Federation or F.A.I.).

During the show in St. Petersburg, she was personally congratulated by Tsar Nicholas II. There, she was presented once again as \\"Baroness\\" de Laroche. Thereafter, the title became commonly used. In July 1910, de Laroche was participating in the week- long airshow at Reims in France. On 8 July, her aeroplane crashed, and she suffered such severe injuries that her recovery was in doubt, but two years later, she was fit again and had returned to flying. On 26 September 1912, she and Charles Voisin were involved in a plane crash. Voisin was killed, and she was severely injured and she died.Early Aviators – Charles Voisin Biography On 25 November 1913 de Laroche won the Aero-Club of France's Femina Cup for a non-stop long-distance flight of over 4 hours duration. During World War I, as flying was considered too dangerous for women, she served as a military driver, chauffeuring officers from the rear zones to the front under fire. In June 1919 de Laroche set two women's altitude records,University of Houson, \\"Engines of our Ingenuity, No. 1813: Raymonde de Laroche\\", undated article by John H. Lienhard, retrieved on 27 March 2008. one at ; and also the women's distance record, at . Death and legacy On 18 July 1919, de Laroche, who was a talented engineer, went to the airfield at Le Crotoy as part of her plan to become the first female test pilot. She co-piloted an experimental aircraft (whether she flew this is not known); on its landing approach the aeroplane went into a dive and crashed, killing both de Laroche and the co-pilot. There is a statue of de Laroche at Paris–Le Bourget Airport in France. From 6 to 12 March 2010, to celebrate the Centennial of Licensed Women Pilots, women pilots from eight countries on three continents used 20 types of aircraft to establish a new world record: 310 girls and women introduced to piloting by women pilots in one week. Women of Aviation Worldwide Week is held annually during the week including 8 March, which marks the anniversary of Raymonde de Laroche's pilot licence.

Take Back the Night is an international event and non-profit organization with the mission of ending sexual, relationship, and domestic violence in all forms. Hundreds of events are held in over 30 countries annually. Events often include marches, rallies and vigils intended as a protest and direct action against rape and other forms of sexual, relationship and domestic violence. In 2001, a group of women who had participated in the earliest Take Back the Night marches, came together to form the Take Back the Night Foundation in support of the events throughout the United States and the world. History Take Back the Night Foundation's Board members have participated in Take Back the Night marches and events from the 1970s to present day. Early Take Back the Night events include a protest in San Francisco against pornography in 1978.Bronstein, Carolyn (2011). Battling Pornography: The American Anti-Pornography Feminist Movement, 1976-1986. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p 165-166. One of the first \\"Take Back the Night\\" marches was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in October 1975, after the murder of a microbiologist, Susan Alexander Speeth, who was stabbed to death while walking home alone. \\"Take Back the Night\\" was used as the title of a 1977 memorial read by Anne Pride at an anti-violence rally in Pittsburgh. Events Events typically consist of a rally followed by a march and often a speak-out or candlelight vigil on violence against women. Early marches were often deliberately women-only in order to symbolize women's individual walk through darkness and to demonstrate that women united can resist fear and violence. (Most marches in the present day include men; the organization differs as each event is organized locally.) The women-only policies caused controversy on some campuses; activists argued that male allies and sexual assault survivors should be allowed to march in support of women and male victims of sexual violence. In current practice, Take Back the Night events are not only inclusive of men, but include men as survivors, bystanders, and supporters. Many colleges, such as Wesleyan University in Connecticut, allow men to participate in speaking on their own experiences with sexual assault. Bowdoin College in Maine organizes a similar candlelight vigil and walk that encourages students of all genders to show solidarity for survivors on campus and in this nation. Michigan State University's Take Back the Night event includes a list of demands to the university community to end sexual violence. While the march began as a way to protest the violence that women experienced while walking in public at night, the purpose of these marches was to speak out against this violence and raise community awareness as a preventive measure against future violence. The mission of Take Back the Night has since grown to encompass all forms of violence against all persons, though sexual violence against women is still the top focus. The word night was originally meant to be taken literally to express the fear that many women feel during the night but has since changed to symbolize a fear of violence in general. This helps the movement incorporate other feminist concerns such as domestic violence and sexual abuse within the home. Take Back the Night events occur on college campuses, in major metropolitan areas, in small towns, on military bases, and even in high schools. International events have been documented in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Bermuda, Canada, Italy, Poland, Germany, Hungary, India, England and many other countries. The common purpose is to advocate for the right of everyone to feel safe from sexual violence. On November 7, 2009 the first Take the Back the Night annual conference took place at Columbia University. Controversy and debate While some Take Back the Night marches encourage men to participate, others still refuse to allow men to be involved under the claim of creating a safe space for women. Several critics have argued that this ignores the struggles of male victims and fails to provide them male role models, as well as implying the need to \\"take back the night\\" from all men, not just those who are perpetrators of sexual violence. Advocacy for having a broad coalition of participants including men, women, and transgender individuals alike has come from many different commentators in a variety of publications. The specific focus of some Take Back the Night events on sexual assaults from strangers and the lack of focus on date rape, child sexual abuse, parental incest, and other such forms of victimization has attracted criticism from a broad group of commentators such as Megan Greenwell of Good Magazine. Greenwell has remarked that the use of the \\"righteous rape\\" trope by Take Back the Night participants, to refer to sexual assault in the open by strangers as being somehow inherently morally different to other types of assault, is belittling and wrong. In the higher- education context, the policy of some institutions to make Take Back the Night events mandatory for students, compelling them to attend regardless of whether they want to or not, has come under criticism by some women's rights activists as being hypocritical and inherently self-defeating. After a 2015 controversy at Virginia Tech emerged in which a mandatory event had some football players in the audience laugh at accounts of sexual assault, try to leave early, and otherwise disrupt the process, 'Womanspace' Co-President Malavika Sahai remarked, \\"Requiring people to go to an event encroaches on that safe space...

Biography The Metcalf family in 1904 Born in Utica, New York, on October 10, 1853 to William and Sarah P. (Howard) Metcalf. He attended the Utica public schools, Utica Free Academy, and Russell's Military Institute at New Haven, Connecticut. In 1872, he entered Yale College where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter); he left in his junior year to attend Yale Law School. He graduated in 1876 and was admitted to the Connecticut bar. In 1877, he continued his legal education at Hamilton College, and was admitted to the New York bar. He practiced in Utica in 1877, and then moved to Oakland, California in 1879. His law practice in California handled real property and commercial cases. He married Emily Corinne Nicholson in 1881; they had two sons, one of them being educated at the Annapolis Naval Academy,The Independent, Volume 57 (1904) New York the other becoming a businessman in California.Merrill Edward Gates, ed.

In congress he served on the Naval Affairs and the Ways and Means committees. Metcalf's legislation for reclamation of arid lands put him in touch with President Theodore Roosevelt. President Roosevelt appointed him, on July 1, 1904, Secretary of Commerce and Labor. As Secretary of Commerce, Roosevelt sent Metcalf to San Francisco in 1905 as an intermediator between the San Francisco school board and 91 Japanese students who were refused entry to public schools. A compromise was reached where the students would be permitted into the public schools while Japan would stop issuing passports to laborers.Wu and Song, editors.

It is home to several important archaeological sites, including those identified as the ancient towns of Azekah and Socho (17:1). Rising up from the valley on its extreme southeast end lies the hilltop ruin Adullam, and on its north lie the ruins of the ancient fortress city of Khirbet Qeiyafa. The valley is named after the large and shady terebinth trees (Pistacia atlantica) which are indigenous to it. On the west side of the valley, near Socho, there is a very large and ancient tree of this kind, in height with a trunk in circumference and a canopy at least in diameter. This tree is notable for being one of the largest terebinths in the area, and marks the upper end of the valley. Since the early 1970s, the valley has also contained a large satellite relay station, with an antenna farm containing some 120 satellite dishes of various sizes. From 2010 to 2014, the region around the valley was believed to be threatened by shale oil extraction through the CCR ground-heating process, with the Green Zionist Alliance and the grassroots group Save Adullam, among others, working to stop exploitation of the region. The plan was ultimately blocked in 2014 by a zoning committee decision. In July 2019, the Elah Valley came under the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, owing largely to its historical importance and the desire to curtail the encroaching city limits of Beit Shemesh to its north. (25 July 2019) Extension of Elah Valley on its southeastern side, Wadi es Sur History The Valley of Elah has gained new importance as a possible point of support for the argument that Israel was more than merely a tribal chiefdom in the time of King David. At Khirbet Qeiyafa, southwest of Jerusalem in the Elah Valley, Professor Yosef Garfinkel has discovered a fortified city from the Iron Age II dated sometime between 1050 and 915 BC. The fortifications have been said to support the biblical account of the United Monarchy at the beginning of Iron Age II.Govier, Gordon \\"Archaeology: What an Ancient Hebrew Note Might Mean\\" Christianity Today 1/18/2010 Others are skeptical and suggest it might represent either a Judahite or Canaanite fortress.

Co-owner of the record label RKM Music, he has produced pianist Luis Perdomo, guitarist David Gilmore, and trumpeter Ralph Alessi. Biography Ravi Coltrane is the son of saxophonist John Coltrane and jazz harpist Alice Coltrane. He is the second of three children; the others were John Jr. and Oran. He is a cousin of experimental music producer Steven Ellison, aka Flying Lotus. He was raised in Los Angeles, California, and was named after sitar player Ravi Shankar. Ravi Coltrane was under two years old in 1967 when his father died. He is a 1983 graduate of El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, California. In 1986, he studied music, concentrating on saxophone at the California Institute of the Arts. He has worked often with Steve Coleman, a significant influence on Coltrane's musical conception. Coltrane has also played with Geri Allen, Kenny Barron, McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santana, Stanley Clarke, and Branford Marsalis. In 1997, after performing on over thirty recordings as a sideman, Coltrane recorded Moving Pictures, his first album as leader, working with drummer Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts, bassist Lonnie Plaxico, and pianist Michael Cain. This led to touring with his working band, featuring Andy Milne on piano, drummer Steve Hass, and bassist Lonnie Plaxico. Coltrane's second album, From the Round Box (2000), was recorded with pianist Geri Allen, trumpeter Ralph Alessi, bassist James Genus, and drummer Eric Harland. Mad 6 (2002), Coltrane's first album for Sony, featured drummer Steve Hass, pianist George Colligan, and bassist James Genus. In Flux (2005) included bassist Drew Gress, pianist Luis Perdomo, and drummer E. J. Strickland. In January 2005, Coltrane performed in India for the first time as part of a delegation of American jazz musicians sent on a State Department tour to promote HIV/AIDS awareness. Also participating were vocalist Al Jarreau, guitarist Earl Klugh, and pianist George Duke. Performances included a January 16 concert in Mumbai (Bombay), a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. in Delhi on January 17, and a music festival in Delhi on January 18 organized by violinist L. Subramaniam. Also on January 18, Coltrane performed at the Coltrane Shankar Centre, where Coltrane met with the man he was named after. Picking up a clarinet to engage in an unplanned jam session with a pair of shehnai players, Coltrane said, \\"I'm a little nervous with the master here.\\"Lavezzoli, Peter. The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Continuum International Publishing Group, page 293, (2006) – . The Coltrane Quartet played at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 2001 and 2013, the Montreux Jazz Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival in 2004, and the Vienna Jazz Festival in 2005. In 2008, Coltrane became part of the Blue Note 7, a septet formed that year in honor of the 70th anniversary of Blue Note Records. The group recorded an album in 2008 entitled Mosaic, which was released in 2009 by Blue Note/EMI, and toured the United States to promote the album from January to April 2009. The group plays the music of Blue Note Records from various artists, with arrangements by members of the band and Renee Rosnes. In 2013 he performed at the Village Vanguard. In 2016 he traveled to Australia to play at the opening of Bird's Basement, the first international section of Birdland. The following year he would return to Australia during September to play at The Basement in Sydney and again at Bird's Basement in Melbourne. During his second visit, the quartet consisted of himself, Johnathan Blake, Glenn Zaleski, and Dezron Douglas.  Personal life  Ravi Coltrane was born on the 6th of August 1965 on Long Island, New York and was the second eldest son in the family. After the death of John Coltrane in 1967, Alice Coltrane moved the family to Los Angeles. At a young age Ravi was sensitive and shy. He took an interest in photography and film and sought to pursue a career in one of the two. He started playing clarinet but switched to the saxophone in high school. Tragedy struck the family again in 1982 when his older brother John Coltrane Jr. died in a car accident at the age of 17. This event had a profound effect on Ravi and he dropped out of school. Despite the trauma his brother's death caused him, it led him to rediscover his musical origins and influenced his decision to study music. He went on to enroll at the California Institute of the Arts in 1986 where he continued to study music. While struggling to play, he graduated and then moved to an apartment with rehearsal space adjacent to a commercial space in Queens in 1991. From there he collaborated as an apprentice with Elvin Jones, Jack DeJohnette, Wallace Roney, Joanne Brackeen, and Steve Coleman. In 1991 while playing with Elvin Jones, Coltrane met Kathleen Hennessy, manager of the Regattabar. They married in 1999. Coltrane is the Chairman of The Coltrane Home, an organization dedicated to preserving the museum and research center based in John and Alice Coltrane's home in Dix Hills, Long Island.

They live in the northwestern part of North America, mostly above the Arctic Circle. Gwichʼin are well known for their crafting of snowshoes, birchbark canoes, and the two-way sled. They are renowned for their intricate and ornate beadwork. They also continue to make traditional caribou-skin clothing and porcupine quillwork embroidery, both of which are highly regarded among Gwichʼin. Today the economy is mostly a mix of hunting, fishing, and seasonal wage-paying employment. Name Their name is sometimes spelled Kutchin or Gwitchin and translates as \\"one who dwells\\" or \\"resident of [a region].\\" Historically, the French called the Gwichʼin Loucheux (\\"squinters\\"), as well as the Tukudh, a term also used by Anglican missionaries. Gwichʼin often refer to themselves by the term Dinjii Zhuu instead of Gwichʼin. Dinjii Zhuu literally translates as \\"Small People,\\" but figuratively it refers to all First Nations, not just Gwichʼin. Gwichʼin language A Gwich'in speaker, recorded in Alaska for Wikitongues. The Gwichʼin language, part of the Athabaskan language family, has two main dialects, eastern and western, which are delineated roughly at the United States-Canada border. Each village has unique dialect differences, idioms, and expressions. The Old Crow people in the northern Yukon have approximately the same dialect as those bands living in Venetie and Arctic Village, Alaska. Approximately 300 Alaskan Gwichʼin speak their language, according to the Alaska Native Language Center. However, according to the UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, Gwichʼin is now a \\"severely endangered\\" language, with fewer than 150 fluent speakers in Alaska and another 250 in northwest Canada. Innovative language revitalization projects are underway to document the language and to enhance the writing and translation skills of younger Gwichʼin speakers. In one project lead research associate and fluent speaker Gwichʼin elder, Kenneth Frank, works with linguists which include young Gwichʼin speakers affiliated with the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy. Gwichʼin tribes and clans The many different bands or tribes of Gwichʼin include but are not limited to: Deenduu, Draanjik, Di'haii, Gwichyaa, Kʼiitlʼit, Neetsaii or Neetsʼit, Ehdiitat, Danzhit Hanlaii, Teetlʼit, and Vuntut or Vantee. Three major clans survive from antiquity across Gwichʼin lands. Two are primary clans and the third has a lower/secondary status. The first clan are the Nantsaii, which literally translates as \\"First on the land\\", the second clan are the Chitsʼyaa which translates as \\"The helpers\\" (second on the land). The last clan is called the Tenjeraatsaii, which translates as \\"In the middle\\" or \\"independents\\". This last clan is reserved for people who marry within their own clan, which is considered incestual. To a lesser degree, it is for children of people who are outside of the clan system. In ancient times this would also refer to the children of Naaʼin, people who were expelled from the tribe due to committing a crime. It also applied to the children of mothers who simply fell outside of the clan system. Prior to 1900, being a Tenjeraatsaii automatically placed a Gwichʼin at the third-lowest rung of the social ladder. They were to some degree ostracized. The second-lowest rung was reserved for war-captured slaves. The lowest social status was that of a banished Naaʼin or bushman. The clan system is no longer well known or used among the Gwichʼin. Location and population Gwichʼin family outside their home, c. 1899 Approximately 9,000 Gwichʼin live in 15 small communities in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory of Canada, and in northern Alaska. Gwichʼin communities include: *Alaska **Arctic Village (Dihai-kutchin and Neetsaii Gwichʼin) **Beaver (Gwichyaa Gwichʼin) **Birch Creek (Deenduu Gwichʼin) **Chalkyitsik (Draanjik Gwichʼin) **Circle (Danzhit Hanlaii Gwichʼin) **Fort Yukon (Gwichyaa Gwichʼin) **Venetie (Dihai-kutchin and Neetsaii Gwichʼin) *Northwest Territories **Aklavik (Ehdiitat Gwichʼin) **Fort McPherson (traditional name, Tetlit Zheh, Tetlit Gwichʼin) **Inuvik (largest of the four Gwichʼin communities in the Gwichʼin Settlement Area (GSA), English is the main language spoken, though schools teach and a handful of local people still speak Gwichʼin.) **Tsiigehtchic (formerly Arctic Red River) (Gwichyaa Gwichʼin) *Yukon **Old Crow (Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation) Oral history The Gwichʼin have a strong oral tradition of storytelling that has only recently begun to be written in the modern orthography. Gwichʼin folk stories include the \\"Vazaagiitsak cycle\\" (literally, \\"His Younger Brother Became Snagged\\"), which focuses on the comical adventures of a Gwichʼin misfit who, among other things, battles lice on a giant's head, plays the fool to the cunning fox, and eats the scab from his own anus unknowingly.Alaska Native Language Archive  Resource Details [Katherine Peter, Vasaagihdzak and Eagle, Bushman] Gwichʼin comedies often contain bawdy humor.Alaska Native Language Archive  Resource Details Adventures of Vasaagihdzak.

This is usually followed with the admission that this was \\"when all of the people could talk to the animals, and all of the animals could speak with the people\\". These stories are often parables, which suggest a proper protocol, or code of behavior for Gwichʼin. Equality, generosity, hard work, kindness, mercy, cooperation for mutual success, and just revenge are often the themes of stories such as: \\"Tsyaa Too Oozhrii Gwizhit\\" (The Boy In The Moon), \\"Zhoh Ts'à Nahtryaa\\" (The Wolf and the Wolverine), \\"Vadzaih Luk Hàa\\" (The Caribou and the Fish).Alaska Native Language Archive  Resource Details Sapir John Haa Googwandak 3.

Gwichʼin living in Inuvik, Aklavik, Fort McPherson, and Tsiigehtchic harvest woodland caribou but not as much as other caribou. The Gwichʼin prefer to hunt Porcupine caribou or the barren-ground Blue Nose herd, who travel in large herds, when they are available. Many hunters claimed that woodland caribou that form very small groups, are wilder, both hard to see and hard to hunt. They are very smart, cunning and elusive. Caribou as cultural symbol The caribou vadzaih is the cultural symbol and a keystone subsistence species of the Gwichʼin, just as the buffalo is to the Plains Indians. In his book entitled Caribou Rising: Defending the Porcupine Herd, Gwich-'in Culture, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Sarah James is cited as saying, \\"We are the caribou people. Caribou are not just what we eat; they are who we are. They are in our stories and songs and the whole way we see the world. Caribou are our life. Without caribou we wouldn't exist.\\" Traditionally, their tents and most of their clothing were made out of caribou skin, and they lived \\"mostly on caribou and all other wild meats.\\" Caribou fur skins were placed on top of spruce branches as bedding and flooring. Soap was made from boiled poplar tree ashes mixed with caribou fat. Drums were made of caribou hide. Overalls were made from \\"really good white tanned caribou skin\\". Elders have identified at least 150 descriptive Gwichʼin names for all of the bones, organs, and tissues. \\"Associated with the caribou's anatomy are not just descriptive Gwichʼin names for all of the body parts including bones, organs, and tissues as well as \\"an encyclopedia of stories, songs, games, toys, ceremonies, traditional tools, skin clothing, personal names and surnames, and a highly developed ethnic cuisine.\\" Ethnobotany In 2001, Gwichʼin Social and Cultural Institute, the Aurora Research Institute, and Parks Canada co- published a book entitled Gwichʼin Ethnobotany: Plants Used by the Gwichʼin for Food, Medicine, Shelter and Tools in collaboration with elders, in which they described dozens of trees, shrubs, woody plants, berry plants, vascular plants, mosses and lichens, and fungi that the Gwichʼin used. Examples included black spruce Picea mariana and white spruce Picea glauca, Ts'iivii which was used as \\"food, medicine, shelter, fuel and tools.\\" Boiled cones and branches were used to prevent and to treat colds. Christianity The introduction of Christianity in the 1840s throughout Gwichʼin territory produced spiritual changes that are still widely in effect today. Widespread conversion to Christianity, as influenced by Anglican and Catholic missionaries, led to these as the two dominant Christian sects among the Gwichʼin. Notable figures in the missionary movement among the Gwichʼin are Archdeacon Hudson Stuck, William West Kirkby, Robert McDonald, Deacon William Loola, and Deacon Albert Tritt. The Traditional Chief, an honorary and lifetime title, of one Gwichʼin village is also an Episcopal priest: the Rev. Traditional Chief Trimble Gilbert of Arctic Village. Chief Gilbert is recognized as the Second Traditional Chief of all of the Athabascan tribes in Interior Alaska through the non-profit Tanana Chiefs Conference.Tanana Chiefs Conference The Takudh Bible is a translation of the entire King James Bible into Gwichʼin. The Takudh Bible is in a century-old orthography that is not very accurate, and thus hard to read. In the 1960s Richard Mueller designed a new orthography for Gwichʼin, which has now become standard. Recognition On 4 April 1975, Canada Post issued two stamps in the Indians of Canada, Indians of the Subarctic series both designed by Georges Beaupré. One was Ceremonial Dress based on a painting by Lewis Parker of a ceremonial costume of the Kutchin tribe /Gwichʼin people. The other, Dance of the Kutcha-Kutchin was based on a painting by Alexander Hunter Murray The 8¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 and 13.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited and the Canadian Bank Note Company. Current politics Caribou is traditionally a major component of their diet. Many Gwichʼin people are dependent on the Porcupine caribou which herd calves on the coastal plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Gwichʼin people have been very active in protesting and lobbying against the possibility of oil drilling in ANWR, due to fears that oil drilling will deplete the population of the Porcupine Caribou herd.Gwichʼin Human Rights Threatened by ANWR Drilling  Cultural Survival Bobbi Jo Greenland Morgan, who is head of the Gwichʼin Tribal Council, along with the Canadian government, the Yukon and Northwest territories and other First Nations, expressed concerns to the United States about the proposed lease sale in the calving grounds of a large cross-border [Porcupine caribou herd] to energy drilling, despite international agreements to protect it.\\" In December, the United States \\"released a draft environmental impact study proposal for the lease sale with a public comment period until February 11, 2019. Environment Canada wrote in a letter to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Alaska office,According to the January 13, 2019 The Globe and Mail article, concerns were raised as there has been a change of structure in the US administration of the ANWR. For decades, the U.S. representative used to come from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The current member is from the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) and operates under a different mandate as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service representatives who worked with Canada on this matter for decades. is an agency operating through the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management which are both under the United States Department of the Interior (DOI). According to Bob Weber, Global Affairs Canada said that the \\"U.S. is living up to the agreement on the Porcupine herd\\". The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is an agency operating through the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management which are both under the United States Department of the Interior (DOI). that \\"Canada is concerned about the potential transboundary impacts of oil and gas exploration and development planned for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain.\\" For similar reasons, Gwichʼin also actively protested the development of oil in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, and a proposed land trade from the United States Wildlife Refuge system and Doyon, Limited.\\"Yukon Flats DEIS\\", IEN Earth, 15 January 2008.

Life Born in the village of Brezovo, Boyadzhiev graduated in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in Sofia in 1932. His work is generally divided into two main periods: until 1951, when he suffered a stroke and temporarily gave up painting, and from the time of his partial recovery a few years later until his death in 1976. After the stroke, he worked with his left hand and in a completely different manner. The first period is characterized by neoclassical style in composing scenes with scenes of rural life. In the second period of the artist's style changed radically in the direction of grotesque imagery, the inclusion of dozens of shapes in compositions and expressive color.

It was licensed to Williams for distribution in North America. Moon Patrol is often credited with the introduction of parallax scrolling in side-scrolling video games. Taito's Jungle King side-scroller, released the same year as Moon Patrol, also uses parallax scrolling. Gameplay Arcade screenshot The player takes the role of a Luna City police officer assigned to Sector Nine, the home of the \\"toughest thugs in the galaxy\\". The player controls a Moon buggy that travels over the Moon's surface, viewing it from the side as it moves towards the right side of the screen. While driving it, obstacles such as craters and mines must be avoided, and various enemies such as UFOs from above and tanks on the ground must be shot down. Gameplay is within a number of courses, and each is divided into 26 checkpoints, named after the letters of the English alphabet. Of these, the five major checkpoints—E, J, O, T and, Z—denote a new \\"stage\\" with a new background and theme; for example, the third stage starting at J introduces mines. The top portion of the screen shows a timeline-style map of the course, with the five major checkpoints clearly marked. Above the map is an indicator of the current checkpoint, the time spent in the stage, and three indicator lights: the top light indicates upcoming enemy aerial attacks, the middle one indicates an upcoming minefield, and the bottom one indicates enemies approaching from behind. At the end of a stage, that time spent is compared to the average, and bonus points are awarded accordingly, at 1,000 plus 100 per second bettered; completing an entire course gives an additional 5,000 points plus 100 per second bettered. There are two unique courses: the \\"Beginner Course\\" and the \\"Champion Course\\". The Champion Course \\"loops\\" forever, and each loop is numbered for convenience, up to 3. Extra lives are given at 10,000 points, and per 20,000 scored up to 50,000; thereafter, no more lives are given. Game ends when the last patrol car is destroyed. The game can be continued, but points scored from one game do not carry over. 999,990 points is the maximum high score that can be achieved; players can exceed this score, but the game retains only the last six digits. Ports Moon Patrol was ported to the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari ST, Commodore 64, VIC-20, MSX, IBM PC (as a self-booting disk), TI-99/4A, and TRS-80 Color Computer. Many of these were published under Atari's Atarisoft label. Reception Moon Patrol received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"1984 Best Science Fiction/ Fantasy Video Game\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. Arcade Express reviewed the arcade version in January 1983 and scored it 8 out of 10.http://www.digitpress.com/library/newsletters/arcadeexpress/arcade_express_v1n11.pdf#page=6 Scott Mace of InfoWorld stated that Moon Patrol for the Commodore 64 was his favorite Atarisoft game, making good use of the computer's sound. Legacy Moon Patrol was included in the retro compilations Arcade Hits: Moon Patrol & Spy Hunter for Game Boy Color and Midway Presents Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Midway Collection 2 for Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Windows. In 2006 Bandai released an enhanced version as Moon Patrol EX for cell phones. On March 22, 2018, Moon Patrol was released for the Nintendo Switch by Hamster as part of the Arcade Archives series. A version subtitled The Milky Way Chronicles was announced in 2018 for the Intellivision Amico. =Clones= A bootleg version called Moon Ranger was released in the arcades the same year as Moon Patrol. Home clones include Desert Patrol for the TRS-80 Color Computer (1983), Gas Hog for the Atari 2600 (1983), Lunar Rover Patrol for the Dragon 32 (1983), Moon Buggy for the Commodore 64 (1983), Moon Alert for the ZX Spectrum (1984), Luna Rover for the ZX Spectrum (1985), Moon Control for the Amstrad CPC (1985), Moonrider for MSX (1986), and Overlander for the Amiga (1993).

Logical systems such as propositional logic are decidable if membership in their set of logically valid formulas (or theorems) can be effectively determined. A theory (set of sentences closed under logical consequence) in a fixed logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are included in the theory. Many important problems are undecidable, that is, it has been proven that no effective method for determining membership (returning a correct answer after finite, though possibly very long, time in all cases) can exist for them. Decidability of a logical system Each logical system comes with both a syntactic component, which among other things determines the notion of provability, and a semantic component, which determines the notion of logical validity. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the theorems of the system, especially in the context of first-order logic where Gödel's completeness theorem establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. In other settings, such as linear logic, the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system. A logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are theorems of the logical system. For example, propositional logic is decidable, because the truth-table method can be used to determine whether an arbitrary propositional formula is logically valid. First-order logic is not decidable in general; in particular, the set of logical validities in any signature that includes equality and at least one other predicate with two or more arguments is not decidable.Trakhtenbrot, 1953 Logical systems extending first-order logic, such as second-order logic and type theory, are also undecidable. The validities of monadic predicate calculus with identity are decidable, however. This system is first-order logic restricted to those signatures that have no function symbols and whose relation symbols other than equality never take more than one argument. Some logical systems are not adequately represented by the set of theorems alone. (For example, Kleene's logic has no theorems at all.) In such cases, alternative definitions of decidability of a logical system are often used, which ask for an effective method for determining something more general than just validity of formulas; for instance, validity of sequents, or the consequence relation {(Г, A)  Г ⊧ A} of the logic. Decidability of a theory A theory is a set of formulas, often assumed to be closed under logical consequence. Decidability for a theory concerns whether there is an effective procedure that decides whether the formula is a member of the theory or not, given an arbitrary formula in the signature of the theory. The problem of decidability arises naturally when a theory is defined as the set of logical consequences of a fixed set of axioms. There are several basic results about decidability of theories. Every (non-paraconsistent) inconsistent theory is decidable, as every formula in the signature of the theory will be a logical consequence of, and thus a member of, the theory. Every complete recursively enumerable first-order theory is decidable. An extension of a decidable theory may not be decidable. For example, there are undecidable theories in propositional logic, although the set of validities (the smallest theory) is decidable. A consistent theory that has the property that every consistent extension is undecidable is said to be essentially undecidable. In fact, every consistent extension will be essentially undecidable. The theory of fields is undecidable but not essentially undecidable. Robinson arithmetic is known to be essentially undecidable, and thus every consistent theory that includes or interprets Robinson arithmetic is also (essentially) undecidable. Examples of decidable first-order theories include the theory of real closed fields, and Presburger arithmetic, while the theory of groups and Robinson arithmetic are examples of undecidable theories. Some decidable theories Some decidable theories include (Monk 1976, p. 234): * The set of first-order logical validities in the signature with only equality, established by Leopold Löwenheim in 1915. * The set of first-order logical validities in a signature with equality and one unary function, established by Ehrenfeucht in 1959. * The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and addition, also called Presburger arithmetic. The completeness was established by Mojżesz Presburger in 1929. * The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and multiplication, also called Skolem arithmetic. * The first-order theory of Boolean algebras, established by Alfred Tarski in 1940 (found in 1940 but announced in 1949). * The first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic, established by Tarski in 1949. * The first-order theory of real-closed ordered fields, established by Tarski in 1949 (see also Tarski's exponential function problem). * The first-order theory of Euclidean geometry, established by Tarski in 1949. * The first-order theory of Abelian groups, established by Szmielew in 1955. * The first-order theory of hyperbolic geometry, established by Schwabhäuser in 1959. * Specific decidable sublanguages of set theory investigated in the 1980s through today.(Cantone et al., 2001) Methods used to establish decidability include quantifier elimination, model completeness, and Vaught's test. Some undecidable theories Some undecidable theories include (Monk 1976, p. 279): * The set of logical validities in any first-order signature with equality and either: a relation symbol of arity no less than 2, or two unary function symbols, or one function symbol of arity no less than 2, established by Trakhtenbrot in 1953. * The first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Tarski and Andrzej Mostowski in 1949. * The first-order theory of the rational numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Julia Robinson in 1949. * The first-order theory of groups, established by Alfred Tarski in 1953. Remarkably, not only the general theory of groups is undecidable, but also several more specific theories, for example (as established by Mal'cev 1961) the theory of finite groups. Mal'cev also established that the theory of semigroups and the theory of rings are undecidable. Robinson established in 1949 that the theory of fields is undecidable. *Robinson arithmetic (and therefore any consistent extension, such as Peano arithmetic) is essentially undecidable, as established by Raphael Robinson in 1950. * The first-order theory with equality and two function symbols The interpretability method is often used to establish undecidability of theories. If an essentially undecidable theory T is interpretable in a consistent theory S, then S is also essentially undecidable. This is closely related to the concept of a many-one reduction in computability theory. Semidecidability A property of a theory or logical system weaker than decidability is semidecidability. A theory is semidecidable if there is an effective method which, given an arbitrary formula, will always tell correctly when the formula is in the theory, but may give either a negative answer or no answer at all when the formula is not in the theory. A logical system is semidecidable if there is an effective method for generating theorems (and only theorems) such that every theorem will eventually be generated. This is different from decidability because in a semidecidable system there may be no effective procedure for checking that a formula is not a theorem. Every decidable theory or logical system is semidecidable, but in general the converse is not true; a theory is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are semi-decidable. For example, the set of logical validities V of first-order logic is semi-decidable, but not decidable. In this case, it is because there is no effective method for determining for an arbitrary formula A whether A is not in V. Similarly, the set of logical consequences of any recursively enumerable set of first-order axioms is semidecidable. Many of the examples of undecidable first-order theories given above are of this form.  Relationship with completeness  Decidability should not be confused with completeness. For example, the theory of algebraically closed fields is decidable but incomplete, whereas the set of all true first-order statements about nonnegative integers in the language with + and × is complete but undecidable. Unfortunately, as a terminological ambiguity, the term \\"undecidable statement\\" is sometimes used as a synonym for independent statement.  Relationship to computability  As with the concept of a decidable set, the definition of a decidable theory or logical system can be given either in terms of effective methods or in terms of computable functions. These are generally considered equivalent per Church's thesis. Indeed, the proof that a logical system or theory is undecidable will use the formal definition of computability to show that an appropriate set is not a decidable set, and then invoke Church's thesis to show that the theory or logical system is not decidable by any effective method (Enderton 2001, pp. 206ff.). In context of games Some games have been classified as to their decidability: * Chess is decidable.Stack Exchange Computer Science. \\"Is chess game movement TM decidable?\\"Undecidable Chess Problem? The same holds for all other finite two-player games with perfect information. * Mate in n in infinite chess (with limitations on rules and gamepieces) is decidable.Mathoverflow.net/Decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-board Decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-boardDan Brumleve, Joel David Hamkins, Philipp Schlicht, The Mate-in-n Problem of Infinite Chess Is Decidable, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 7318, 2012, pp. 78–88, Springer , available at .

They are a polyphonic instrument, with one of the pipes functioning as a drone and the other two playing the melody in thirds and sixths. Predecessors of the launeddas can be traced back to approximately 2700 BCE in Egypt, where reed pipes were originally called \\"memet\\". During the Old Kingdom of Egypt (2778–2723 BCE), memets were depicted on the reliefs of seven tombs at Saqqara, six tombs at Giza, and the pyramids of Queen Khentkaus.

They are played using circular breathing. Since the late 20th century the launeddas have also been used in non-traditional contexts. In 1990, the American jazz saxophonist Dave Liebman released a CD called The Blessing of the Old. Long Sound, where he collaborates with the launeddas players Alberto Mariani, Carlo Mariani, and Dionigi Burranca. The CD was recorded in Milan in November 1989. In 1996, the British free jazz saxophonist Evan Parker released a double-CD collaboration with Carlo Mariani and other world musicians entitled Synergetics—Phonomanie III, which was recorded in Ulrichsberg, Austria in September 1993.

Dasiphora fruticosa is a disputed name, and the plant is still widely referenced in the horticultural literature under its synonym Potentilla fruticosa. Common names include shrubby cinquefoil, golden hardhack, bush cinquefoil, shrubby five-finger, tundra rose, and widdy. Description It grows to tall, rarely up to . The habit is variably upright to sprawling or prostrate, but stems are often ascending especially those stems with many long branches. The bark of older stems is shreddy with long thin strips. The plants are densely leafy, the leaves divided into five or seven (occasionally three or nine) pinnate leaflets. The leaflets are linear- oblong, long, with entire margins and more or less acute ends. The foliage (both leaves and young stems) is pubescent, variably covered in fine silky, silvery hairs about 1 mm long. The flowers are produced terminally on the stems and are cm across, buttercup-shaped, with five petals and 15–25 stamens; the petals are pale to bright yellow (orange to reddish in some western Chinese populations). The fruit is a cluster of achenes covered with long hairs. The species is variably dioecious or bisexual; flowering is typically from early to late summer.

Cultivation and decorative uses A cultivar with orangey flowers 'Mckay's White' cultivar Shrubby cinquefoil is a popular ornamental plant in temperate regions. Different cultivars are variable with flowers ranging from white to yellow, orange and pink, but they are all hardy plants that produce flowers for much of the summer. The flowers are always small, flat, and round, but there are many dozens on each bush. It is very often used by cities and businesses for landscaping because of its hardiness and low maintenance. It was introduced into cultivation in the 18th century, but many of the modern cultivars, particularly those with orange or red flowers, derive from collections by Reginald Farrer in western China in the early 20th century. The vast majority of sellers and gardeners still use the old name Potentilla fruticosa. All the characteristics of small leaves, delicate flowers, and orange to brown flaky bark make the shrubby cinquefoil suitable for Bonsai. It is very popular in Japan and is gaining popularity in Europe. Cultivars Below is a recommended selection of over 130 cultivars which have been named.

It recounts the tale of young American Peter Standish, played by Howard (nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor), who is transported back to London in 1784, one year after American Independence, and meets his ancestors. The film was based on the play of the same name by John L. Balderston, itself loosely based on Henry James' incomplete 1917 novel, The Sense of the Past. The play premiered in London in 1926. Howard played Standish in the hugely successful 1929 Broadway production, which he co- produced and co-directed with Gilbert Miller . The film was thought to have been lost until it was rediscovered in the 1970s. A newly restored 35mm print has been made, and the restored version was first shown at the 2011 H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Plot In 1784, shortly after the United States wins its independence, American Peter Standish (Leslie Howard) sails from New York to England to marry his cousin. Upon hearing of a Frenchman crossing the English Channel in a balloon, Peter regrets that he will not be able to see the marvels the future has in store. In 1933, his descendant, also named Peter Standish (Leslie Howard again), unexpectedly inherits a house in Berkeley Square, London. He becomes increasingly obsessed with his ancestor's diary, causing his fiancée Marjorie Frant (Betty Lawford) great concern. When they have tea with the American ambassador (Samuel S. Hinds), Peter confides to the diplomat with eager anticipation his conviction that he will be transported back 149 years at 5:30 that day. Peter is convinced that all he needs to do is follow his ancestor's diary, since he already knows what happens, from reading it. He rushes home, and just as he opens the door, he is indeed back in 1784, taking the place of the earlier Peter Standish just as he arrives at the house, then owned by his relations, the Pettigrews. Lady Ann (Irene Browne), and her grown offspring, Tom (Colin Keith-Johnston), Kate (Valerie Taylor) and Helen (Heather Angel) are there to greet him. The Pettigrews, being in desperate financial straits, are anxious for Kate to marry the wealthy American. Peter is determined not to alter the future he has read about, until he sees Helen for the first time. He tries to fight his attraction to her, but ultimately fails. Helen, meanwhile, is being pressed by her mother to marry Mr. Throstle (Ferdinand Gottschalk), but, Helen has determined, even before Peter's arrival, not to marry. She later confesses to Peter, that she had been dreaming of him, before she saw him. As time goes on, Peter keeps inadvertently giving offense with his unfamiliarity with 18th century customs. People also begin to fear him, as he blunders and speaks of things which have not yet taken place. For example, when he commissions Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint his portrait, he praises another Reynolds work by name, one the painter has only just begun. Kate becomes convinced that Peter is demonically possessed and breaks their engagement. Helen, however, is sympathetic to his difficulties, and falls in love with him. Helen eventually presses Peter for an explanation of his \\"second sight\\", which he has only hinted at. Though he refuses to speak openly, she somehow sees in his eyes visions of his modern world, with all its horrors as well as its marvels, and guesses the truth. Knowing he has become disillusioned, living among ghosts born 149 years before his time, and desperately unhappy with the day-to-day realities of her era (including a lack of hygiene and plumbing, and not bathing regularly in what he calls a \\"filthy little pigsty of a world\\"), she urges him to return to his own time. He wants to stay with her regardless of the consequences, but in the end, he does go back to 1933. When he visits Helen's grave, he learns that she died on June 15, 1787 at the age of 23. Marjorie comes to see him, worried about his sanity because he has been saying that he is from the 18th century. Peter believes his ancestor had switched places with him. He tells her he cannot marry her. Peter is consoled by the epitaph on Helen's grave, and her conviction that they will be together, \\"not in my time, nor in yours, but in God's\\".

The New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall called it \\"an example of delicacy and restraint, a picture filled with gentle humor and appealing pathos.\\" He particularly praised Leslie Howard, writing, \\"He has done excellent work in other films, but it is doubtful whether he has ever given so impressive and imaginative a performance.\\" Variety declared the film \\"an imaginative, beautiful and well-handled production\\", but predicted that it would not fare well at the American box office because of the very British cast and dialogue. John Mosher of The New Yorker also praised the film, writing that \\"the charm that was in the play is there, with Leslie Howard again in his stage role, and with the good, even poetic, lines conserved, and the handsome eighteenth-century London mounted for us with a great deal of taste.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote: \\"Artistically and handsomely produced and beautifully acted, \\"Berkeley Square\\" emerges as high-class entertainment for the better class of picture-goers; it is rather slow for the masses.\\" Leonard Maltin gives this “intriguing fantasy” 3 out of 4 stars. Remake In 1951, 20th Century Fox produced a Technicolor adaptation, with substantial alterations to the plot, as The House in the Square (also known I'll Never Forget You and Man of Two Worlds), starring Tyrone Power and Ann Blyth. Irene Browne reprised her role as Lady Ann Pettigrew in the remake. In the 1933 film, Standish's mistakes in vocabulary and his foreknowledge inspire suspicion and then fear when he at last speaks openly about the future and his disgust for the 18th century. In the 1951 version, Standish is an atomic scientist who ends up being (anachronistically) accused of witchcraft because of his scientific endeavors. The films end very differently. In the 1933 film, Standish ends his engagement and plans to stay alone in the house in Berkeley Square, awaiting the day when he and Helen will be reunited, “in God's time.” In the 1951 film, there is no fiancée. After Standish returns from his journey into the past, he goes to Helen's grave and learns that she died of grief soon after he was taken away to Bedlam. He meets his friend's sister, also played by Ann Blyth, suggesting the possibility that she is Helen, reincarnated.

A common television and movie special effect is to scroll credits, while leaving the background stationary. Scrolling may take place completely without user intervention (as in film credits) or, on an interactive device, be triggered by touchscreen or a keypress and continue without further intervention until a further user action, or be entirely controlled by input devices. Scrolling may take place in discrete increments (perhaps one or a few lines of text at a time), or continuously (smooth scrolling). Frame rate is the speed at which an entire image is redisplayed. It is related to scrolling in that changes to text and image position can only happen as often as the image can be redisplayed. When frame rate is a limiting factor, one smooth scrolling technique is to blur images during movement that would otherwise appear to \\"jump\\". Computing = Implementation = Scrolling is often carried out on a computer by the CPU (software scrolling) or by a graphics processor. Some systems feature hardware scrolling, where an image may be offset as it is displayed, without any frame buffer manipulation (see also hardware windowing). This was especially common in 8 and 16bit video game consoles. = UI paradigms = In a WIMP-style graphical user interface (GUI), user-controlled scrolling is carried out by manipulating a scrollbar with a mouse, or using keyboard shortcuts, often the arrow keys. Scrolling is often supported by text user interfaces and command line interfaces. Older computer terminals changed the entire contents of the display one screenful (\\"page\\") at a time; this paging mode requires fewer resources than scrolling. Scrolling displays often also support page mode. Typically certain keys or key combinations page up or down; on PC-compatible keyboards the page up and page down keys or the space bar are used; earlier computers often used control key combinations.The widely used Wordstar word processor used the \\"diamond\\" of Ctrl-S/E/D/X to move the cursor left, up, right, and down, and Ctrl-R and Ctrl-C to page up and down. Some computer mice have a scroll wheel, which scrolls the display, often vertically, when rolled; others have scroll balls or tilt wheels which allow both vertical and horizontal scrolling. Some software supports other ways of scrolling. Adobe Reader has a mode identified by a small hand icon (\\"hand tool\\") on the document, which can then be dragged by clicking on it and moving the mouse as if sliding a large sheet of paper. When this feature is implemented on a touchscreen it is called kinetic scrolling. Touch-screens often use inertial scrolling, in which the scrolling motion of an object continues in a decaying fashion after release of the touch, simulating the appearance of an object with inertia. An early implementation of such behavior was in the \\"Star7\\" PDA of Sun Microsystems ca. 1991-1992. Scrolling can be controlled in other software-dependent ways by a PC mouse. Some scroll wheels can be pressed down, functioning like a button. Depending on the software, this allows both horizontal and vertical scrolling by dragging in the direction desired; when the mouse is moved to the original position, scrolling stops. A few scroll wheels can also be tilted, scrolling horizontally in one direction until released. On touchscreen devices, scrolling is a multi-touch gesture, done by swiping a finger on the screen vertically in the direction opposite to where the user wants to scroll to. If any content is too wide to fit on a display, horizontal scrolling is required to view all of it. In applications such as graphics and spreadsheets there is often more content than can fit either the width or the height of the screen at a comfortable scale, and scrolling in both directions is necessary. =Text= In languages written horizontally, such as most Western languages, text documents longer than will fit on the screen are often displayed wrapped and sized to fit the screen width, and scrolled vertically to bring desired content into view. It is possible to display lines too long to fit the display without wrapping, scrolling horizontally to view each entire line. However, this requires inconvenient constant line-by-line scrolling, while vertical scrolling is only needed after reading a full screenful. Software such as word processors and web browsers normally uses word-wrapping to display as many words in a single line as will fit the width of the screen or window or, for text organised in columns, each column. Demos Scrolling texts, also referred to as scrolltexts or scrollers, played an important part in the birth of the computer demo culture. The software crackers often used their deep knowledge of computer platforms to transform the information that accompanied their releases into crack intros. The sole role of these intros was to scroll the text on the screen in an impressive way.http://tomaes.32x.de/text/faq.php#2.3. Many scrollers were plain horizontal scrollers, but demo coders also paid a lot of attention to creating new and different types of scrolling. The characters could, for example, continuously alter their shape, take unusual flying paths or incorporate color effects such as raster bars. Sometimes it makes the text nearly unreadable. Film and television Scrolling is commonly used to display the credits at the end of films and television programs. Scrolling is often used in the form of a news ticker towards the bottom of the picture for content such as television news, scrolling sideways across the screen, delivering short-form content.  Video games  In computer and video games, scrolling of a playing field allows the player to control an object in a large contiguous area. Early examples of this method include Taito's 1974 vertical-scrolling racing video game Speed Race, Sega's 1976 forward-scrolling racing games Moto-Cross (Fonz) and Road Race, and Super Bug. The Namco Galaxian arcade system board introduced with Galaxian in 1979 pioneered a sprite system that animated pre- loaded sprites over a scrolling background, which became the basis for Nintendo's Radar Scope and Donkey Kong arcade hardware and home consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.Making the Famicom a Reality, Nikkei Electronics (September 12, 1994) Parallax scrolling, which was first featured in Moon Patrol, involves several semi-transparent layers (called playfields), which scroll on top of each other at varying rates in order to give an early pseudo-3D illusion of depth. ' is a method used in side-scrolling beat 'em up games with a downward camera angle where players can move up and down in addition to left and right. A previously much used alternative to video game scrolling is the flip-screen method.  Studies  A 1993 article by George Fitzmaurice studied spatially aware palmtop computers. These devices had a 3D sensor, and moving the device caused the contents to move as if the contents were fixed in place. This interaction could be referred to as “moving to scroll.” Also, if the user moved the device away from their body, they would zoom in; conversely, the device would zoom out if the user pulled the device closer to them. Smartphone cameras and “optical flow” image analysis utilize this technique nowadays. A 1996 research paper by Jun Rekimoto analyzed tilting operations as scrolling techniques on small screen interfaces. Users could not only tilt to scroll, but also tilt to select menu items. These techniques proved especially useful for field workers, since they only needed to hold and control the device with one hand. A more recent study from 2013 by Selina Sharmin, Oleg Špakov, and Kari-Jouko Räihä explored the action of reading text on a screen while the text auto-scrolls based on the user’s eye tracking patterns. The control group simply read text on a screen and manually scrolled. The study found that participants preferred to read primarily at the top of the screen, so the screen scrolled down whenever participants’ eyes began to look toward the bottom of the screen. This auto-scrolling caused no statistically significant difference in reading speed or performance.

The use of the word simple does not refer to the nature of the producers or of their production, but rather to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved.  Origins  Simple exchange of commodities is as old as the history of trade, insofar as it has progressed beyond barter, and occurred for thousands of years before most production became organised in the capitalist way. It begins when producers in a simple division of labour (e.g. farmers and artisans) trade surpluses to their own requirements, with the aim of obtaining other products with an equal value, for their own use. Through the experience of trade, regular exchange values become established for products, which reflect an economy of labour-time. Engels argued explicitly that the Marxian law of value applied also to simple exchange, this law being modified in the capitalist mode of production when all the inputs and outputs of production (including means of production and labour power) become tradeable commodities. This interpretation is however not accepted by all Marxists, some of whom see capitalist markets as functioning in a completely different way from pre- capitalist markets. Engels aimed to give a consistent explanation of the evolution and development of market economy from simple beginnings to the complexities of modern capitalist markets, but some argue he disregards the transformation of the relations of production involved.  Relations of production  Simple commodity production is compatible with many different relations of production, ranging from self-employment where the producer owns his means of production, and family labour, to forms of slavery, peonage, indentured labour, and serfdom. The simple commodity producer could aim just to trade his products for others with an equivalent value, or he could aim to realise a profit. That is to say, simple commodity production is not specific to any particular mode of production, and might be found in many different modes of production, with various degrees of sophistication. It does not necessarily imply that all inputs or outputs of productive activity are commodities traded in markets. Thus, for example, simple commodity producers could produce some products for their own use on their own land, while trading another part of their products. They might buy or trade some tools and equipment, but also make some themselves.  From simple commodity production to capitalist production  The large-scale transformation of simple commodity production into capitalist production based on the wage labour of employees occurred only in the last two centuries of human history. It is preceded by the strong growth of merchant trade, supported by financiers who earn rents, profit and interest from the process. The merchants not only act as intermediary between producers and consumers, but also integrate more and more of production into a market economy. That is, more and more is produced for the purpose of market trade, rather than for own use. The initial result is known as \\"merchant capitalism\\", which flourished in Western European cities in the 17th and 18th century. However, the transformation from simple commodity production into capitalist production accompanying industrialisation requires profound changes in property relations, because it must be possible to trade freely in means of production and labour power (the factors of production). Only when that trade becomes possible, can the whole of production be reorganised to conform to commercial principles. Marx describes capitalist society as \\"a society where the commodity-form is the universal form of the product of labour, hence the dominant social relation is the relation between men as possessors of commodities\\". He argues that \\"The capitalist epoch is... characterized by the fact that labour-power, in the eyes of the worker himself, takes on the form of a commodity which is his property; his labour consequently takes on the form of wage-labour... it is only from this moment that the commodity-form of the products of labour becomes universal.\\" Thus, \\"...from the moment there is a free sale, by the worker himself, of labour power as a commodity... from then onwards... commodity production is generalized and becomes the typical form of production.\\" For that purpose, many legal, political, religious and technical restrictions imposed on trade must be overcome. The unification of a \\"home market\\" among people in a country who speak the same language typically stimulated nationalist ideologies. But depending on the existing social systems, the transformation might occur in many different ways. Typically, though, it has involved wars, violence and revolutions, since people were unwilling to just give away assets, rights and income that they previously had. Communally owned property, inherited plots of land, the property of religious orders and state property had to be privatised and amalgamated, in order to become tradeable assets in the process of capital accumulation. The ideology of the rising bourgeoisie typically emphasized the benefits of privately owned property for the purpose of wealth creation and industriousness. Marx refers to this process as the primitive accumulation of capital, a process which continues particularly in developing countries to this day. Typically, previously independent producers on the land are proletarianised and migrate to the urban centres, in search of work from an employer. Simple commodity production nevertheless continues to occur on a large scale in the world economy, particularly in peasant production. It also persists within industrialised capitalist economies in the form of self- employment by free producers. Capitalist firms sometimes contract out specialised services to self-employed producers, who can produce them at a lower cost, or provide a superior product.  Marxian economics  In Marxian political economy, simple commodity production also refers to a hypothetical economy used to interpret some of Karl Marx's insights about the economic laws governing the development of commodity trade: it refers to a market economy in which all producers own the resources (including the ability to work) that they use in production. No-one is a proletarian, selling his or her labor power to another. Instead, each is self-employed. In this imaginary model, there is a direct correspondence between prices and the values of commodities. The model is imaginary, because no such society has ever existed in history; simple commodity production has always combined with some other modes of production, and as soon as a market economy reaches any size, it begins to utilise wage labor in production, and falls under the sway of the laws of capital accumulation.

The highway crosses the Peel River and the Mackenzie Rivers using a combination of seasonal ferry service and ice bridges. Year-round road access from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk opened in November 2017 with the completion of the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway, creating the first all-weather road route, connecting to the Canadian road network with the Arctic Ocean, in Canada. The highway is named for the famous Yukon Mountie William Dempster, who earned renown for discovering the fate of The Lost Patrol.  Route description  The highway begins east of Dawson City, Yukon on the Klondike Highway. There are no highway or major road intersections along the highway's route. It extends in a north-northeasterly direction to Inuvik, passing through Tombstone Territorial Park and crossing the Ogilvie and Richardson mountain ranges. Dempster Highway near the Richardson Mountains. Major landmarks  History  The Dempster Highway roughly follows the old dog sled route from Dawson City to Fort McPherson and is named for Corporal (later Inspector) William Dempster of the North-West Mounted Police. During the late 19th century, and in response to the Klondike Gold Rush, the North-West Mounted Police established a presence in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. Their activities included winter dog sled patrols between outposts and communities. One such patrol followed a route from Dawson City to the NWMP outpost at Fort McPherson, established in 1903. In December 1910, NWMP Inspector Francis Joseph Fitzgerald led three men on the annual winter patrol from Fort McPherson to Dawson City. They became lost on the trail, and subsequently died of exposure and starvation. When they failed to arrive in Dawson City as expected, Corporal Dempster and two constables were sent out on a rescue patrol in March 1911. Dempster and his men found the bodies of Fitzgerald's patrol on March 22, 1911.  Construction  Expedition by Cpl. William Dempster in search of the Lost Patrol, Dawson City, Yukon Territory, 1911 In 1958, as oil and gas exploration were expanding in the Mackenzie Delta, the Canadian government decided to build a road from Dawson City in Yukon to Aklavik in the Northwest Territories. The road was intended as an overland, year-round supply link to southern Canada. Survey work began in 1958. With the August, 1959, discovery of oil in the Eagle Plains area, the government granted concessions to the oil industry to stimulate more exploration in the area. This provided more motivation for a road to transport equipment, infrastructure, and revenue to and from the sites. Construction of the road, then known as Yukon Territorial Road No. 11, began at Dawson City in January 1959. The northern terminus of the road was changed to the new town of Inuvik. Due to high costs and ongoing funding disagreements between the federal and Yukon governments, progress was slow until 1961. Once the Eagle Plains oil discovery was found to have no commercial potential, construction stopped in 1962 after 115 km (71 mi) of roadbed had been built. Seasonal maintenance of the existing road continued but no further work was done. In 1964, the road was renamed the Dempster Highway, after petitions by Vancouver Yukoners Association and the Yukon Order of Pioneers. Construction resumed in 1970 as the Canadian government sought to assert sovereignty over their Arctic territories after the American discovery of oil and gas deposits at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in 1968. Work was further motivated by speculation that an oil pipeline might be built in the Mackenzie Valley. At the time of its construction, the highway was the most northerly major road project to date. Weather and daylight conditions presented challenges. In 1979, a work crew was trapped in a blizzard in the Richardson Mountains and was almost lost. Construction had to account for the permafrost; heat transfer from the highway to the ground had to be prevented so the permafrost would not melt. To address this, the road was built on top of a gravel berm, ranging from 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) up to 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in), to insulate the permafrost from the road above. Some construction was completed by the Canadian Forces; 3 Field Squadron, RCE from CFB Chilliwack built bridges over the Ogilvie River in 1971 and the Eagle River in 1977. The final section of road was completed in 1978, at a cost of $132 million. The highway was officially opened on August 18, 1979, at Flat Creek, Yukon.

Tuktoyaktuk is one of six Inuvialuit communities in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. Tuktoyaktuk is commonly referred to simply by its first syllable, Tuk .Welcome To The Hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk Website The settlement lies north of the Arctic Circle on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, and is the only community in Canada on the Arctic Ocean that is connected to the rest of Canada by road. Formerly known as Port Brabant, the community was renamed in 1950 and was the first place in Canada to revert to the traditional Indigenous name.  History  Trans Canada Trail sign in Tuk Ice hills near Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories Satellite image of Liverpool Bay, the Husky Lakes, and the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula Tuktoyaktuk is the anglicized form of the native Inuvialuit place-name, meaning \\"resembling a caribou\\". According to legend, a woman looked on as some caribou, common at the site, waded into the water and turned into stone, or became petrified. Today, reefs resembling these petrified caribou are said to be visible at low tide along the shore of the town. No formal archaeological sites exist today, but the settlement has been used by the native Inuvialuit for centuries as a place to harvest caribou and beluga whales. In addition, Tuktoyaktuk's natural harbour was historically used as a means to transport supplies to other Inuvialuit settlements. Between 1890 and 1910, a sizeable number of Tuktoyaktuk's native families were wiped out in flu epidemics brought in by American whalers. In subsequent years, the Dene people, as well as residents of Herschel Island, settled here. By 1937, the Hudson's Bay Company had established a trading post. On 9 September 1944, a serious fall windstorm blew through the community and severely damaged several buildings and schooners docked at the harbour, also killing 11 people en route back from a reindeer station on the Anderson River on the schooner Cally.The Moccasin Telegraph, March 1945 Radar domes were installed beginning in the 1950s as part of the Distant Early Warning Line, to monitor air traffic and detect possible Soviet intrusions during the Cold War. The settlement's location (and harbour) made Tuk important in resupplying the civilian contractors and Air Force personnel along the DEW Line. In 1947, Tuktoyaktuk became the site of one of the first government day schools, designed to institutionalize racist education policies forcing Inuit youth into 'mainstream' Canadian culture.Keith J. Crowe, A History of the Original Peoples of Northern Canada, Arctic Institute of North America, McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal and London – 1974. https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racial-segregation-of- indigenous-peoples-in-canada The community of Tuktoyaktuk eventually became a base for the oil and natural gas exploration of the Beaufort Sea. Large industrial buildings remain from the busy period following the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries 1973 oil embargo and 1979 summertime fuel shortage. This brought many more outsiders into the region. In late 2010, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency announced that an environmental study would be undertaken on a proposed all-weather road between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk. Work on the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway officially started on 8 January 2014, and the highway was officially opened on 15 November 2017.  Geography  Tuktoyaktuk is set on Kugmallit Bay, near the Mackenzie River Delta, and is located on the Arctic tree line. Tuktoyaktuk is the gateway for exploring Pingo National Landmark, an area protecting eight nearby pingos in a region which contains approximately 1,350 of these Arctic ice-dome hills. The landmark comprises an area roughly , just a few miles west of the community, and includes Canada's highest (the world's second-highest) pingo, at . Employment Many locals still hunt, fish, and trap. Locals rely on caribou in the autumn, ducks and geese in both spring and autumn, and fishing year- round. Other activities include collecting driftwood, berrypicking and reindeer herding. Most wages today, however, come from tourism and transportation. Marine Transportation Services (MTS) is a major employer in this region. In addition, the oil and gas industry continues to employ explorers and other workers. Demographics Tuktoyaktuk Panorama At the 2016 Census, the Hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk had a population of 898, up 5.2% from the 2011 census total of 854. There are 283 private dwellings, and a population density of .The average annual personal income in 2015 was $21,984 Canadian and the average family income was $55,424. Local languages are Inuinnaqtun (Inuvialuktun) and English with a few North Slavey and Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib) speakers. Tuktoyaktuk is predominately Indigenous (90.8%) with Inuit (Inuvialuit) making up 88.0%, 9.2% non-Aboriginal, 1.7% First Nations and 1.1% giving multiple Indigenous backgrounds. In 2017 the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 1,026 with an average yearly growth rate of 1.3 from 2007. Climate Tuktoyaktuk displays a subarctic climate (Dfc), just short of a polar (tundra) climate, as the July mean temperature is barely above . Since the Arctic Ocean freezes over for much of the year, the maritime influence is minimized, resulting in cold winters and a strong seasonal lag in spring. This results in April being much colder than October and May much colder than September. March is also colder than December, and is the only month yet to record a temperature above freezing at any point. Due to the dominance of cold air, Tuktoyaktuk has a lower precipitation rate than many desert climates. In spite of this, the cold temperatures mean it receives more than a metre of snow a year on average. Thanks to its landmass link many thousands of kilometres to the south, temperatures way above average can occur in summer in spite of the cold surrounding waters. As of 2018, this is still yet to result in any high above . Tuktoyaktuk's climate stands in stark contrast to those of Northern Norway on similar latitudes, but is in many ways less extreme in comparison with Eastern Canada on higher latitudes, where summers are colder. Transportation Tuktoyaktuk/James Gruben Airport links Tuktoyaktuk to Inuvik. This 30-minute flight costs a few hundred dollars per passenger. Formerly in winter time, the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road provided road access to Inuvik. The $300-million Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway opened in November 2017, which provides all-season access to Inuvik, which connects to the rest of the highway networks in Canada.

It is in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and since 2014 it has been the administrative capital of the Palghar district. Palghar lies on the Western Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway in the busy Mumbai-Ahmedabad rail corridor. The town is located about 87 kilometers north of Mumbai, about 35 kilometers north of Virar and about 24 kilometers west of the Mumbai- Ahmedabad National Highway at Manor.  History  On 1 August 2014, Palghar became the 36th district of Maharashtra. Its history is alternate with its old district Thane. Jawhar, Vasai and Palghar tehsils have a historical legacy. Vasai (then known as Bassein) was under the Portuguese Empire. Chimaji Appa, the Maratha military commander later captured Vasai fort from the Portuguese and embedded the Maratha flag on Vasai. Palghar was one of the important points in 1942 of the Chalejav campaign. On 14 August 1942, there was an uprising against the British in Palghar, in which Kashinath Hari Pagdhare, Govind Ganesh Thakur, Ramprasad Bhimashankar Tiwari, Ramchandra Mahadev Churi, and Govind Sukur More were killed. The main circle of Palghar is known as \\"Paachbatti\\" (which means 'five lights' in Marathi) in honour of these martyrs. 14 August has been declared \\"Martyrs Day\\" in Palghar, when people gather at Paachbatti Circle to honour the five who sacrificed their lives for Indian independence. Demographics At the 2011 Census of India, Palghar had a population of 68,930. Males numbered 36,523 (52.9%) and females 32,407 (47.1%). The literacy rate was 77.52%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy was 81.2% and female literacy 73.35%. 11.8% of the population was under 6 years of age. Marathi is the most widely spoken language with Warli, Vadvali and Vanjari dialects. Small communities of Gujaratis and Muslims speak Gujarati and Urdu respectively. Palghar has an urban population of 1,435,210, thus about 48% of the total population lives in the urbanized area.  Culture  Kunbi, Bhandari, Warli (Adivasi), Katkari, Malhar Koli, Vanjari, Vadval, Mali (Sorathi) are the predominant castes in Palghar. The Vanjaris are a nomadic tribe that have their roots in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan. Their language is distinct from standard Marathi as it has a high influence of Rajasthani and Gujarati. Vadval is the most numerous community present in Palghar. They are said to be the descendants of Yadava dynasty of Devagiri who established themselves here. They form one of the very few Marathi-speaking communities which belong to Kshatriya varna but not the traditional 96-clan (96 - Kuli) Maratha caste. Warli Painting and famous Tarapa dance features contribution towards art by the Warli community. Warli painting and art stretch back to a millennium. Warli art is also appreciated in foreign countries. Warlis represent the earliest settlers of the land around the present times and their culture has largely influenced the later cultures in and around the area. The Koli (fishermen) community of Palghar is a reminder of the city's links with the Arabian sea. Fisheries form a large part of trade and diet of Palghar and also take up a major role in cultural events. The Kolis are further divided into subcastes such as Vaiti, Mangele, Bari, etc. = Art, crafts and tourism = Antarang Sanskrutik Kala Darpan Pratishthan Saphale is an NGO/Trust based in Saphale, working for the development of visual arts, performing arts and music, and for social and environmental issues.

Palghar being the seat of Taluka and District, has many government offices and people working there. Agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy, and fisheries are practiced in abundance in the rural areas around the city and fuel the economy of the city. Palghar had also been a hub for wood smuggling in the post-independence era, a practice that has been largely curbed by the Forest department and police. Other than wood, the secluded beaches were known to attract smugglers trying to offshore their goods and enter Mumbai by road to avoid customs. Education The town has a number of schools and colleges. A number of construction projects have recently begun in the region. There is scope to set up more schools and colleges for the increasing resident population. * Sonopant Dandekar Arts, V.S. Apte Commerce & M.H.

Billed as The largest festival of its kind in the world, the festival hosts a concentrated flurry of cultural and political talks and debates, along with its well-established children's events programme. Charlotte Square during the Edinburgh International Book Festival, 2013 It coincides with the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, as well as the other events that comprise the Edinburgh Festival. Nick Barley is the Director.  History  The first Book Festival took place in a tent in Edinburgh in 1983. Initially a biennial event, it began to be held annually in 1997. It is a large (225,000 visitors in 2015) and growing international event, central to Edinburgh's acclaimed August arts celebrations. Perhaps partly as a result of this, Edinburgh was named the first UNESCO City of Literature in 2004.  Programme  In 2016 there were over 800 authors and others from over 55 countries in the 17 days that the festival ran. Events ranged from writing workshops, education events, panel discussions, to talks and performances by international writers, poets, playwrights, musicians, illustrators, historians and philosophers. There are events for both adults and children. Past festivals have featured the likes of: Running alongside the general programme is a Children's programme. Incorporating workshops, storytelling, panel discussions, author events and book signings, the Children's programme is popular with both the public and schools alike, and is among the world's largest books and reading event for young people. It regularly attracts authors like Jacqueline Wilson, Joan Lingard, Charlie Higson and Anne Fine. There is also an Unbound program which takes place in the evening, with free music and spoken word events sponsored by Edinburgh Gin. In May 2016 a pilot satellite literary event, organised by the Book Festival, took place in Falkirk called LandWords. In August 2016, using the name Booked!, the Book Festival held events in three other locations in Scotland (Aberdeen, Greenock and Galashiels). This expansion was partially funded by the People's Postcode Lottery.  Venue  The Book Festival is primarily held in a set of marquees in Charlotte Square Gardens, Edinburgh, at the West End of George Street. Since 2017, the event and some venues have expanded into George Street, partly to cope with visitor numbers but also to reduce the festival's impact on the privately owned gardens. Fringe events As with all large and successful festivals, the Book Festival has sprouted a number of fringe events over the years. In 2004 and 2006 an event called Thirsty Lunch promoted itself as a cheap, non-establishment alternative. In 2008 there were two separate festivals running at the same time as the main Book Festival. The first was the Edinburgh Book Fringe, which held its events at the Word Power bookshop (now Lighthouse bookshop) on Nicolson Street, Edinburgh. The second was the West Port Book Festival, which was centred on second-hand/antiquarian bookshops in the West Port area of the city. The latter ran from 2008 until 2012. Both fringe festivals provided free events and were seen as a less formal alternatives to the main festival.

Alpha Xi Delta is a member of National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), the umbrella organization of 26 national sororities. By its constitution, Alpha Xi Delta is one of the few social sororities that accepts graduate students as well as undergraduates.The Constitution itself is not available to the public. However, an official workbook of the organization's academic standards specifically mentions \\"graduate students who were initiated as graduate students,\\" clearly making reference to the Constitutional possibility of such members. Link: http://www.alphaxidelta.org/clientuploads/Academic/2012%20Academic%20Achievement%20Chair%20Breakout%20Workbook.pdf . The sorority has over 185,000 initiated members and maintains active chapters at 130 institutions across the United States, and its headquarters are located in Indianapolis, Indiana.  History  In 1893, ten women at Lombard College in Galesburg, Illinois founded Alpha Xi Delta. It is referred to as a fraternity due to having been founded before the term \\"sorority\\" was used. The ten founders of Alpha Xi Delta were: * Cora Bollinger Block (1869–1944) was the first President of Alpha Xi Delta. She went on to be the first Grand President. * Alice Bartlett Bruner (1878–1966) taught music at the Lombard Conservatory. She had two daughters who later joined the sorority as a legacy. * Bertha Cook Evans (1874–1957) had three daughters, two of whom joined Alpha Xi Delta. Later in her life, she served as a fraternity house director. * Harriett Luella McCollum (1874–1948) and Cora, roommates at Lombard, were the first to make the plan for Alpha Xi Delta. * Lucy W. Gilmer (1872–1939) was the first Vice President of Alpha Xi Delta. After 1893 she transferred schools, where she studied to be a physician. * Lewie Strong Taylor (1867–1950) designed the quill symbol, which is on display at national headquarters. * Almira Lowry Cheney (1875–1946) was a teacher who went on to pioneer religious education by becoming a minister of the Universalist Church. She was also Chaplain of the 12th, 13th, and 14th National Conventions for Alpha Xi Delta. * Frances Elizabeth Cheney (1869–1901), in her time as an Alpha Xi, served as chaplain, secretary, and president. She is given credit for many of the fraternity's early songs. * Eliza Drake Curtis Everton (1867–1934) was Alpha Xi Delta's second president. * Julia Maude Foster (1875–1948) was a member of the committee who drafted Alpha Xi Delta's first constitution. In 1904, the sorority joined the National Panhellenic Conference. Alpha Xi Delta's first chairman of the NPC wrote the Panhellenic Creed, a statement still used on many college campuses today. Alpha Xi Delta House at the right  Symbols  The colors of Alpha Xi Delta are light blue, navy blue, and gold. The fraternity flower is the pink Killarney Rose, as chosen by the founders to complement the white rose of Sigma Nu fraternity whose brothers helped to found Alpha Xi Delta at Lombard College. The mascot is a teddy bear, and the official mascot is named BetXi Bear. Each initiated member wears the golden quill (the official symbol), which is depicted in the crest and represents the open motto \\"The Pen is Mightier than the Sword.\\" The pearl and the diamond are the official jewels. = Symphony = The open creed is called \\"The Symphony of Alpha Xi Delta\\", and it lists the ideals of the sorority's members. It was written in 1924 by Helen Willis Lynn, Alice Matthews, and Almira Cheney, one of the original founders.  Philanthropy  Alpha Xi Delta's national philanthropic partner has been Autism Speaks since April 2, 2009. The sorority has since raised more than $7,000,000 for its philanthropic partner.Blog post: ΑΞΔ raises more than $2M for Autism Speaks , accessed 27 May 2014 Chapters and alumnae associations observe World Autism Awareness Day on April 2 and Autism Awareness Month throughout the month of April. Sisters raise awareness in various ways, including passing out blue ribbons, placing advertisements in campus and local newspapers, distributing information in the community and appearing on local television programs to educate people about autism. The sorority also participates in Light It Up Blue, an initiative started by Autism Speaks in 2009 to help \\"Shine a Light on Autism by Illuminating Prestigious Buildings and Monuments Throughout the World\\". Members participate by lighting their chapter houses, campus monuments and sports facilities blue during the month of April. Prior to partnering with Autism Speaks, Alpha Xi Delta was the only sorority that did not have an official organization as a philanthropy. The \\"Choose Children\\" policy gave each chapter direction to choose which organization they wanted to help. = The AmaXIng Challenge = Alpha Xi Delta Sorority house at Ohio University The AmaXIng Challenge is Alpha Xi Delta's signature fundraising event designed to raise critical funds for Autism Speaks. Each college chapter hosts at least one of the following events per year: *Step It Up Walk/Run *Xi Man Competition *Xi Marks the Spot *Football FrenXI *Puzzlepalooza *Karaoke for a Cause  Controversies  In 2010, the Miami University chapter of Alpha Xi Delta was suspended until 2014 for alcohol violations stemming from their destructive formal at Cincinnati's National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. As of 2019, the sorority had yet to recolonize. In 2011, the Alpha Xi Delta national organization revoked the Binghamton University chapter's charter for \\"continu[ing] to violate Alpha Xi Delta’s policies on risk management and observance of Fraternity rituals despite efforts to lead the chapter to a culture consistent with Alpha Xi Delta’s policies and value.\\" In 2017, the Cornell University chapter of Alpha Xi Delta was placed on probationary status for three years, \\"as a result of incidents determined to include both hazing and alcohol policy violations.\\" In 2017, the University of Central Florida chapter of Alpha Xi Delta was suspended on the grounds of \\"allegations of alcohol-related misconduct, which includes providing alcohol to someone underage; hazing; and possessing and/or providing false and misleading information and/or falsification of university records.\\" = Controversy over Autism Speaks affiliation = In 2017, editorials appeared in the Temple University and the College of New Jersey student newspapers criticizing Alpha Xi Delta for its philanthropic connections to Autism Speaks on the grounds that the organization misunderstands, misrepresents, and promotes harmful stereotypes of individuals with autism.

It is located just outside Columbia, Tennessee, United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and has served as the headquarters for the Sons of Confederate Veterans since 1992. History The house was built in 1837 by brothers James and Nathaniel Dick, wealthy New Orleans cotton merchants, as a gift for their sister, Sarah Todd. Sarah and her husband, Christopher Todd, lived in Elm Springs for the rest of their lives. After their deaths, the property went to their daughter, Susan Todd. She was the wife of Abraham M. Looney, a prominent attorney in Maury County and a Tennessee State Senator. During the Civil War, Looney was an outspoken southerner and served in the Confederate States Army as a captain in command of Company H, 1st Tennessee Infantry which Sam Watkins of \\"Company Aytch\\" fame was a member. Looney was later promoted to lieutenant colonel. In November 1864 Confederate units of the Army of Tennessee began the march north for Nashville in the ill-fated Franklin-Nashville Campaign. The Union Army, which had occupied Maury County for several months, was preparing defensive positions ahead of the oncoming Confederate troops under General John B. Hood in a line of defense extending from the Mooresville Pike to the Mount Pleasant Pike. As Union forces under the command of General John M. Schofield began their hasty withdrawal from Columbia, they began destroying important buildings along the line of withdrawal by fire as a defensive tactic, and many of Maury County's antebellum homes were destroyed. Elm Springs anchored the eastern flank of their line and was slated for destruction as the last Union troops left Columbia. Responding to pleas from local citizens, Confederate Brigadier General Frank C. Armstrong dispatched a squad of mounted infantry to ensure the safety of Lieutenant Colonel Looney's home and property. The house likely would have burned down if it had not been for the arrival of Confederate troops who extinguished the fires they found. The Akin family acquired the property about 1910 and in 1985 the Gillham family purchased it and restored it to near original state. In 1992 it became the headquarters of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Military Order of the Stars and Bars. Together, the two organizations co-published a magazine, Confederate Veteran. In late 2005, the organizations separated over political differences and the Military Order of Stars and Bars moved from Elm Springs to Daphne, Alabama.

He went to Essex and Leningrad universities for his postgraduate work, and taught at Keele and the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, before joining Oxford University in 1998. Between 1986 and 1995, Service published a three-volume biography of Vladimir Lenin. He wrote several works of general history on 20th-century Russia, including A History of Twentieth-Century Russia. He published a trilogy of biographies on the three most important Bolshevik leaders: Lenin (2000), Stalin (2004) and Trotsky (2009). His biography of Trotsky was strongly criticised by Service's Hoover Institution colleague Bertrand Mark Patenaude in a review for the American Historical Review.McLemee, Scott. \\"The Re-Assassination of Leon Trotsky\\". Inside Higher Ed. 8 July 2011 Patenaude, reviewing Service's book alongside a rebuttal by the Trotskyist David North (In Defence of Leon Trotsky), charged Service with making dozens of factual errors, misrepresenting evidence, and \\"fail[ing] to examine in a serious way Trotsky's political ideas\\". Service responded that the book's factual errors were minor and that Patenaude's own book on Trotsky presented him as a \\"noble martyr\\". The book was criticised by the German historian of communism Hermann Weber, who led a campaign to prevent Suhrkamp Verlag from publishing it in Germany. Fourteen historians and sociologists signed a letter to the publishing house. The letter cited 'a host of factual errors,' the 'repugnant connotations' of the passages in which Service deals with Trotsky's Jewish origins, implicitly accusing him of anti-Semitism, and Service's recourse to 'formulas associated with Stalinist propaganda' for the purpose of discrediting Trotsky.“Robert Service has written a diatribe, not a scientific polemic!” The World Socialist Web Site. Retrieved 28 November 2011 Suhrkamp announced in February 2012 that it would publish a German translation of Robert Service's Trotsky in July 2012.

At the beginning of the 1780s, he settled in Feuerthalen and established a dynasty of artists that became known as the \\"Bleulerische Malschule\\". Between 1799 and 1804, he worked at Laufen Castle near Schaffhausen, then returned home. He catered to the popular tastes of the time; often in the style of Ludwig Hess, who had died prematurely.

He learned to climb while attending high school in Germany, and later founded the Dartmouth Mountaineering Club in 1936 while attending Dartmouth College. Some of his classic first ascents include the North Face of the Grand Teton and the \\"Durrance Route\\" on Devils Tower. His successful completion of the Grand's Exum Ridge and West Face, along with his contributions to the development of bouldering, stand among his other climbing achievements. On the 1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2 he attempted to climb K2, the second tallest mountain in the world. He became embroiled in controversy after four members of the expedition died and the expedition leader, Fritz Wiessner, blamed Durrance. A book seeking to shed light on the event, K2: The 1939 Tragedy, was published in 1993. The authors, William Putnam, a former president of the Alpine Club, and Andy Kauffman, a former director, relied on a Durrance diary that surfaced for the first time fifty years after the event to place responsibility for the deaths on Wiessner. Ed Viesturs, in his book \\"K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain\\", revisits all the available documentation and suggest instead that the unplanned decision to decommission all lower camps played a major role in the tragedy. During the 1939 climb, Durrance saved the life of Chap Cranmer who was suffering from pulmonary edema. Mr. Cranmer's family thanked Durrance by getting him an internship with Dr. James J. Waring, an international expert on tuberculosis. Durrance took the internship and later became a pulmonary physician at a Denver hospital. In addition to climbing and medicine another passion of his was hybridizing irises. Durrance died on November 7, 2003, aged 91, survived by his widow, Stella Coulter Durrance and their five children.

The two subspecies are the nominate Dall sheep or Dall's sheep and the more southern subspecies, Stone sheep (also spelled Stone's sheep) (O. d. stonei), which is a slate brown with some white patches on the rump and inside the hind legs. Taxonomy and genetics Research has shown the use of these subspecies designations is questionable. Complete colour intergradation occurs between white and dark morphs of the species with intermediately coloured populations, called Fannin sheep (O. d. fannini), found in the Pelly Mountains and Ogilvie Mountains of the Yukon Territory.Sheldon, C. (1911). The Wilderness of the Upper Yukon. First edition. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. mitochondrial DNA evidence has shown no molecular division along current subspecies boundaries, although evidence from nuclear DNA may provide some support. Also at the species level, current taxonomy is questionable because hybridization between O. dalli and O. canadensis has been recorded in recent evolutionary history. The specific name dalli, is derived from William Healey Dall (1845–1927), an American naturalist. The common name Dall sheep or Dall's sheep is often used to refer to the species O. dalli. An alternative use of common name terminology is that thinhorn sheep refers to the species O. dalli, while Dall's sheep and Stone's sheep refer to subspecies O. d. dalli and O. d. stonei, respectively. Natural history =Ecology= The sheep inhabit the subarctic mountain ranges of Alaska, the Yukon Territory, the Mackenzie Mountains in the western Northwest Territories, and central and northern British Columbia. Dall sheep are found in relatively dry country and try to stay in a special combination of open alpine ridges, meadows, and steep slopes with extremely rugged ground in the immediate vicinity, to allow escape from predators that cannot travel quickly through such terrain. Male Dall sheep have thick, curling horns. The females have shorter, more slender, slightly curved horns. Males live in bands that seldom associate with female groups except during the mating season in late November and early December. Lambs are born in May. During the summer when food is abundant, the sheep eat a wide variety of plants. Their winter diet is much more limited, and consists primarily of dry, frozen grass and sedge stems available when snow is blown off, lichen, and moss. Many Dall sheep populations visit mineral licks during the spring, and often travel many miles to eat the soil around the licks.Home Page, Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Adfg.state.ak.us. Retrieved on 16 September 2011. Primary predators of this sheep are wolf packs, coyotes, black bears, and grizzly bears; golden eagles are predators of the young. The Dall sheep has been known to butt gray wolves off the face of cliffs. Dall sheep can often be observed along the Alaska Highway at Muncho Lake in British Columbia, along the Seward Highway South of Anchorage, Alaska, within Denali National Park and Preserve (which was created in 1917 to preserve Dall sheep from overhunting), at Sheep Mountain in Kluane National Park and Reserve, and near Faro, Yukon (Fannin's sheep).

The concise encyclopedia of American radio [electronic resource] / Christopher H. Sterling, editor ; Cary O'Dell, assistant editor ; Michael C. Keith, consulting editor. New York ; London : Routledge, 2010. The original constitution for the organization read: ::\\"Believing that radio is in its very nature one of the most important factors in our national and international welfare, we, the representatives of the institutions of higher learning, engaged in educational broadcasting, do associate ourselves together to promote, by mutual cooperation and united effort, the dissemination of knowledge to the end that both the technical and educational feature of broadcasting may be extended to all.\\"Original Constitution of Association of College and University Broadcasting Stations ACUBS held its first annual conference July 1 and 2 1930 in Columbus, Ohio joining with the Institution of Education by Radio. In September 1934, the organization rewrote its constitution, and changed its name from the Association of College University Broadcasting Stations (ACUBS) to the \\"National Association of Educational Broadcasters.\\" In 1938, NAEB persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to reserve five radio channels for educational broadcasting. In 1945 the FCC reserved five of the 40 channels in new high-frequency band for Non-commercial educational stations. There were initially planned to be AM services; however, they eventually manifested as FM ones. NAEB merged with the Association of Education by Radio-Television in 1956. It was reorganized in 1963 with two new divisions, Educational Television Stations and National Educational Radio. These divisions lasted until 1973, when they were diminished. Their roles were taken over by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and Association of Public Radio Stations (APRS) respectively.Engelman, R. (1996). Public radio and television in America a political history. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications. The APRS became the \\"Washington lobby and public relations arm of CPB-qualified radio stations.\\" The APRS merged with National Public Radio (NPR) in 1977, which allowed NPR to provide \\"leadership of a full-fledged membership organization providing member stations with training, program promotion and management, and representing the interests of public radio stations before Congress, the FCC and other regulatory organizations.\\"Soundscapes: The Evolution and Challenges of National Public Radio.

History  Haberfield was named by early landholder Richard Stanton, after his wife's maiden name.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia =Aboriginal culture= The area of which is now known as Haberfield was part of the broader area which lived people from the Darug tribe known variously as the Wangals or Cadigals from the Eora nation. Modern day Hawthorne Canal is believed to be the border between these two tribes. There is no specific evidence of indigenous settlement in the area. However, the area that is now Haberfield was one of the last areas in the inner-west to be developed so, in the late 19th century it again became a home to local kooris.Coupe, S&R;: Speed the Plough, page 9-19,128. Ashfield Municipal Council, 1988 =European settlement= Nicholas Bayly, a soldier, received the first land grant in the area in 1803 but sold it two years later to Simeon Lord who called it Dobroyde Estate. Lord gave the land to his daughter Sarah Ann and her new husband David Ramsay as a wedding present in 1825 and it stayed in the hands of the Ramsay family until the end of the century. The Ramsays developed orchards in the area and built a number of fine houses for various members of the family including Yasmar (Ramsay spelt backwards) and St David's Presbyterian church. They also created four of the suburb's current streets: Ramsay Street, Dalhousie Street (named after the Ramsay's historic home in Scotland), Boomerang Street and Waratah Street.Coupe, S&R;: Speed the Plough, page 26,36–37. Ashfield Municipal Council, 1988 The nave of St Oswald's was built soon after subdivision of the suburb, and the Anglican parish divided from that of St John's Ashfield. In 1901, landholder Richard Stanton bought from two Ramsay children and subdivided the area to create a garden suburb. Sydney had recently suffered outbreaks of the bubonic plague in overcrowded parts of the inner city and the garden suburb movement was a response to that, encouraging fresh air. He also claimed the development to be \\"slumless, laneless and publess\\". The houses were designed by the architectural firm Spencer, Stansfield and Wormald. Stanton named the suburb 'Haberfield', after the English branch of his family. The fact that the development started in 1901 and a number of the early streets were named after prominent federal politicians has led to the suburb also being known as 'The Federation Suburb'.Coupe, S&R;: Speed the Plough, page 151-170. Ashfield Municipal Council, 1988 =Heritage= The majority of houses in Haberfield are protected under a 'heritage order', which is the main reason why so many original Victorian and Federation houses still exist in the area. Renovations and additions to both houses and properties must follow strict guidelines ensuring they stay true to the era's style. Some examples of rules include: banning the addition of second storeys unless in the existing roof space, banning the demolishing of any protected houses, ensuring a 50:50 ratio of 'hard surface' to 'soft surface' on the property, ensuring house exteriors are painted in federation colours. Houses must also have a roof consisting of terracotta or slate tiles. One notable landmark is Yasmar, at 185 Parramatta Road. Formerly known as Yasmar Hostel (not Yasmar Hotel as previously stated here), this building was built circa 1870 of dressed stone, with a verandah and iron columns. It also features French windows and extensive cedar joinery, and is set in a lush garden. It is now part of Yasmar Juvenile Centre and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/11 For further information on the heritage of Haberfield, contact the Haberfield Association =Recent developments= A proposal was made by McDonald's to build a drive-thru outlet on Parramatta road in Haberfield. This was fiercely opposed by most local residents who want to preserve the suburb's unique cultural heritage.http://inner-west- courier.whereilive.com.au/news/story/residents-oppose-haberfield-maccas1/ The development application was rejected by Ashfield Council,http://inner-west- courier.whereilive.com.au/news/story/haberfield-mcdonald-s-proposal-rejected/ however McDonald's appealed to the NSW Land and Environment Court and a final judgement indicates that, subject to some changes to the plans, a 12-month trial has been granted for a 24/7 restaurant.http://inner-west- courier.whereilive.com.au/news/story/haberfield-maccas/ Since the opening of McDonald's in Haberfield, there have been complaints about odours coming from the site http://www.news.com.au/business/companies/big-stink-over-haberfield- maccas/story-fnda1bsz-1226644245258 as well as rubbish littering the nearby streets.

These include a hand made pasta shop, a traditional Italian bakery, traditional and contemporary Italian pastry shops and gelaterias, and Italian delicatessens and butchers, as well as many Italian cafes, coffee shops and restaurants. The primary supermarket in Haberfield is IGA Lamonica which also has a well-stocked delicatessen inside. Many of the shops in Haberfield have received various awards for their quality. Schools Haberfield has three primary schools but no high schools. Two of the schools are state run: Haberfield Public School on the corner of Bland Street Denman avenue and Dobroyd Point Public School on Waratah Street. The third is the St Joan of Arc Catholic School on Dalhousie Street opposite St Joan of Arc Church. Marion station on the Dulwich Hill Line Transport Aerial view of the Metropolitan Goods railway line before conversion to light rail The Dulwich Hill Line of Sydney's light rail network - a converted freight railway line - skirts the suburb's eastern border with Leichhardt. Because of this, none of the three stops serving Haberfield are centrally located within the suburb. Hawthorne (near Barton Ave) and Marion (near Marion St) are the primary stops serving Haberfield. Taverners Hill (near Parramatta Road) is in the south-east corner of the suburb at the southern border with Summer Hill and the south-eastern border with Lewisham, in addition to the border with Leichhardt. The service offers a direct link to Pyrmont and Darling Harbour and provides interchanges with Lewisham railway station on the Inner West & Leppington Line and Dulwich Hill railway station on the Bankstown Line. Sydney Buses operates routes 461 (from the city down Parramatta Rd), 406 (from either Five Dock or Hurlstone Park through Dalhousie St), 438 (from city or Abbotsford via Ramsay St) and 439 (from city or Mortlake via Ramsay St). Summer Hill railway station, on the T2 Inner West & Leppington Line is close to the suburbs southern border. Five Dock railway station on the Sydney Metro West rapid transit line will serve the neighbouring suburb of Five Dock. In July 2019, the Westconnex M4 East tunnel opened to traffic - with no traffic lights for 51 km from Glenbrook (near Penrith) to Haberfield.

Haberfield espoused the philosophy of the Garden Suburb with its gardens containing distinctive planting, fences, gates and curving tiled paths. Houses in Haberfield were typically 'detached' double-brick dwellings situated on their own block of land measuring 50' x 150' (15 m x 45 m). No two houses were alike, although there were many common themes throughout the suburb. The roofs were either slate or Marseilles tile. All had front verandahs. Decorative features typically used in this area include leadlight windows depicting Australian flora and fauna, Art Nouveau timber detailing and tuckpointed brickwork.http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au Houses listed under the NSW Heritage Act: * Bunyas, 5 Rogers Avenue, Haberfield * Derrylyn, 16 Deakin Avenue, Haberfield * Yasmar, 185 Parramatta Road, Haberfield Image: 16 Deakin Ave Haberfield Spring 2012-102.jpg Derrylyn, 16 Deakin Avenue, Haberfield Image: 71 Ramsay Street Haberfield Spring 085-M.jpg71 Ramsay Street, Haberfield Image: 27 Stanton Road Haberfield Spring 12- 069-M.jpg27 Stanton Road Haberfield Image: 20 Stanton Road Haberfield Spring 2012- 072-M.jpg20 Stanton Road Haberfield Image: 19 Stanton Road Haberfield Spring 2012-071-M.jpg19 Stanton Road Haberfield Image: 51 Stanton Road Haberfield Spring 058-M.jpg51 Stanton Road Haberfield Image: 11 Rogers Avenue Haberfield 094.jpg11 Rogers Avenue Haberfield Image: 56 O'Connor Strret Haberfield Spring 050-M.jpg56 O'Connor Street Haberfield Image: Spring arrives at 53 Dudley St Haberfield 023-M.jpg53 Dudley Street, Haberfield =Parks= Several parks lie within the suburb of Haberfield such as; Algie Park, Robson Park, Reg Cody Reserve, Hawthorne Canal and Wadim 'Bill' Jegorow Reserve Image:Haberfield Town Square.JPGHaberfield Town Square Image:Wadim Jegorow Reserve 2, Haberfield.jpgWadim (Bill) Jegorow Reserve, Wolesely Street File:Wadim Jegorow Reserve, Haberfield.jpgWadim 'Bill' Jegorow Reserve at Wolesely Street, Haberfield Image:Iron Cove Creek beside Henley Marine Drive, Five Dock.jpgView of Iron Cove Creek with Wadim (Bill) Jegorow Reserve on the right  See also  * Australian non-residential architectural styles * List of Anglican churches in the Diocese of Sydney References *St Joan of Arc Parish Bulletin External links *The Haberfield Association *The Haberfield Heritage *Haberfield Heritage's photostream *Haberfield, the Garden Suburb * [CC-By-SA] * [CC-By-SA] Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Inner West Category:Hume Highway ","title":"Haberfield, New South Wales"},{"id":"913398","text":"Daulatabad Fort, also known as Devagiri or Deogiri, is a historical fortified citadel located in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. It was the capital of the Yadava dynasty (9th century–14th century CE), for a brief time the capital of the Delhi Sultanate (1327–1334), and later a secondary capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate (1499–1636). Around the sixth century CE, Devagiri emerged as an important uplands town near present-day Aurangabad, along caravan routes going towards western and southern India. The historical triangular fortress in the city was initially built around 1187 by the first Yadava king, Bhillama V. In 1308, the city was annexed by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, which ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent. In 1327, Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate renamed the city as \\"Daulatabad\\" and shifted his imperial capital to the city from Delhi, ordering a mass migration of Delhi's population to Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital of the Delhi Sultanate was shifted back from Daulatabad to Delhi. In 1499, Daulatabad became a part of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, who used it as their secondary capital. In 1610, near Daulatabad Fort, the new city of Aurangabad, then named Khadki, was established to serve as the capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate by the Ethiopian military leader Malik Ambar, who was brought to India as a slave but rose to become a popular Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Most of the present-day fortification at Daulatabad Fort was constructed under the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Mythological origin Lord Shiva is believed to have stayed on the hills surrounding this region. Hence the fort was originally known as Devagiri, literally \\"hills of god\\". The Fort Daulatabad Fort surrounded by a moat (Khandak) filled with water. In ancient times, crocodiles were said to have been kept in the moat for protection from enemy attacks. The area of the city the hill-fortress of Devagiri (sometimes Latinised to Deogiri). It stands on a conical hill, about 200 meters high. Much of the lower slopes of the hill has been cut away by Yadava dynasty rulers to leave 50-meter vertical sides to improve defenses. The fort is a place of extraordinary strength. The only means of access to the summit is by a narrow bridge, with the passage for not more than two people abreast, and a long gallery, excavated in the rock, which has, for the most part, a very gradual upward slope. About midway along this gallery, the access gallery has steep stairs, the top of which is covered by a grating destined in time of war to form the hearth of a huge fire kept burning by the garrison above. At the summit, and at intervals on the slope, are specimens of massive old cannon facing out over the surrounding countryside. Also at the midway, there is a cave entrance meant to confuse the enemies. The fort had the following specialties which are listed along with their advantages : # No separate exit from the fort, only one entrance/exit - This is designed to confuse the enemy soldiers to drive deep into the fort in search of an exit, at their own peril. # No parallel gates - This is designed to break the momentum of the invading army. Also, the flag mast is on the left hill, which the enemy will try to capitulate, thus will always turn left. But the real gates of the fort are on the right & the false ones on the left, thus confusing the enemy. # Spikes on the gates - In the era before gunpowder, intoxicated elephants were used as a battering ram to break open the gates. The presence of spikes ensured that the elephants died of injury. # Complex arrangement of entryways, curved walls, false doors - Designed to confuse the enemy, false, but well-designed gates on the left side lured the enemy soldiers in & trapped them inside, eventually feeding them to crocodiles. # The hill is shaped like a smooth tortoise back - this prevented the use of mountain lizards as climbers, because they cannot stick to it. The City Daulatabad (19°57’N 75°15’E) is located at a distance of 16 km northwest of Aurangabad, the district headquarters and midway to Ellora group of caves. The original widespread capital city is now mostly unoccupied and has been reduced to a village. Much of its survival depends on the tourists to the old city and the adjacent fort. History The Mughal Army captures Devagiri. Capture of Devagiri Fort in 1633. The site had been occupied since at least 100 BCE, and now has remains of Hindu & Jain temples similar to those at Ajanta and Ellora. A series of niches carved with Jain Tirthankara in cave 32. The city is said to have been founded c. 1187 by Bhillama V, a Yadava prince who renounced his allegiance to the Chalukyas and established the power of the Yadava dynasty in the west. During the rule of the Yadava king Ramachandra, Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate raided Devagiri in 1296, forcing the Yadavas to pay a hefty tribute. When the tribute payments stopped, Alauddin sent a second expedition to Devagiri in 1308, forcing Ramachandra to become his vassal. In 1328, Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi Sultanate transferred the capital of his kingdom to Devagiri, and renamed it Daulatabad. The sultan made Daulatabad (Devagiri) his second capital in 1327 https://www.britannica.com/place/India/The-Tughluqs. Some scholars argue that the idea behind transferring the capital was rational, because it lay more or less in the centre of the kingdom, and geographically secured the capital from the north-west frontier attacks. In the Daulatabad fort, he found the area arid & dry. Hence he built a huge reservoir for water storage & connected it with a far-away river. He used siphon system to fill up the reservoir. However, his capital-shift strategy failed miserably. Hence he shifted back to Delhi & earned him the moniker \\"Mad King\\". The next important event in the Daulatabad fort time-line was the construction of the Chand Minar by the Bahmani ruler Hasan Gangu Bahmani, also known as Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah (r. 3 August 1347 – 11 February 1358). Hasan Gangu built the Chand Minar as a replica of the Qutb Minar of Delhi, of which he was a great fan of. He employed Iranian architects to built the Minar who used Lapis Lazuli & Red Ocher for coloring. Currently, the Minar is out of bounds for the tourists, because of a suicide case. As we move further into the fort, we can see the Chini Mahal, a VIP prison built by Aurangzeb. In this prison, he kept Abul Hasan Tana Shah of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty of Hyderabad. The antecedents of Abul Hasan Tana Shah, the last Qutub Shahi king are shrouded in mystery. Although a kinsman of the Golconda royals, he spent his formative years as a disciple of renowned Sufi saint Shah Raju Qattal, leading a spartan existence away from the pomp and grandeur of royalty. Shah Raziuddin Hussaini, popularly known as Shah Raju, was held in high esteem by both the nobility and commoners of Hyderabad. Abdullah Qutub Shah, the seventh king of Golconda was among his most ardent devotees. He died in prison leaving no male heir to the throne. Most of the present-day fortification was constructed under the Bahmanis and the Nizam Shahs of Ahmadnagar. The Mughal Governor of the Deccan under Shah Jahan, captured the fortress in 1632 and imprisoned the Nizam Shahi prince Husain Shah. Monuments The outer wall, in circumference, once enclosed the ancient city of Devagiri and between this and the base of the upper fort are three lines of defenses. Along with the fortifications, Daulatabad contains several notable monuments, of which the chief are the Chand Minar and the Chini Mahal. The Chand Minar is a tower . high and . in circumference at the base, and was originally covered with beautiful Persian glazed tiles. It was erected in 1445 by Ala-ud-din Bahmani to commemorate his capture of the fort. The Chini Mahal (literally: China Palace), is the ruin of a building once of great beauty. In it, Abul Hasan Tana Shah, the last of the Qutb Shahi kings of Golconda, was imprisoned by Aurangzeb in 1687. Transport =Road Transport= Daulatabad is in the outskirts of Aurangabad, and is on the Aurangabad - Ellora road (National Highway 2003). Aurangabad is well connected by road and 20 km away from Devagiri. =Rail Transport= Daulatabad railway station is located on the Manmad-Purna section of South Central Railways and also on the Mudkhed-Manmad section of the Nanded Division of South Central Railway. Until reorganisation in 2005, it was a part of the Hyderabad Division Aurangabad is a major station near Daulatabad. The Devagiri Express regularly operates between Mumbai and Secunderabad, Hyderabad, via the city of Aurangabad.

It is somewhat similar in plumage and flight style to a common scavenger, the turkey vulture, and may benefit from being able to blend into groups of vultures. It feeds on small terrestrial tetrapods of all kinds. Taxonomy In 1844 the English zoologist George Robert Gray, in his List of the Specimens of Birds in the Collection of the British Museum, mentioned the zone-tailed hawk under the common name \\"white spotted buzzard\\" and coined the binomial name Buteo albonotatus. As Gray omitted a species description, his binomial name is considered nomen nudum, a naked name, and is not recognised. Instead, the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup is recognised as the authority as in 1847 he provided a brief description and used Gray's name Buteo albonotatus. The type locality is Mexico. The specific epithet albonotatus combines the Latin albus meaning \\"white\\" with notatus meaning \\"marked\\". The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Description Zone-tailed hawk (Buteo Albonotatus) The zone-tailed hawk is a fairly large but slender Buteo hawk. Grown birds are in length with a wingspan of about . The zone-tailed is comparable in length and wingspan to common large Buteos found to the north such as Swainson's and red-tailed hawk, but may weigh considerably less. Their body mass can range from . In measurements, the sexes are close in size, but the female, at an average of , is much heavier and bulkier than the male, at an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the fairly long tail is and the tarsus is . The adult plumage is mostly blackish. The notable exception is that the flight feathers are barred with lighter gray, which can appear solid silver-gray from a distance. The tail has three or four bands (the \\"zones\\" of the common name), white from below and light gray from above, of which the one second from the tip is particularly broad and conspicuous. The cere and legs are yellow, the lores are light gray and a light touch of white may be seen on the face. Immatures are similar except for small white spots on the breast and tails with narrow gray and black bands and a broad dark tip. The zone-tailed hawk adults resemble the common black hawk but are distinctly more slender in flight and overall small, and they have more white bars on the tail. Other Buteo hawks in their dark phase, especially the broad-winged hawk, may appear similar but often have more silvery coloration on the wings and are broader- winged. The call is a loud scream, a somewhat typical Buteo call, dropping in pitch at the end, kra kree-kree-kree-kree. In at least some birds, there is an abrupt rise in pitch (like a break to a falsetto voice) in the middle and an equally abrupt drop back down. They are most often heard vocalizing when engaging in breeding displays at the beginning of the mating season. When disturbed at the nest, they may utter a long, lower-pitched raaaaauu. Distribution and habitat Zone-tailed hawks range from parts of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas almost throughout inland Mexico and the central portions of Central America down into eastern Colombia, Ecuador and, more sporadically, into Peru, southern Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and northern Argentina. In winter they generally withdraw from the U.S. and northernmost Mexico, with these populations wintering mostly in Oaxaca and the Yucatán Peninsula. The hawks of Central America may be seasonally migratory, although their movements are not well known. Zone-tails sometimes wander out of their normal range, and the bird was once recorded in Nova Scotia. They can adapt to various habitats across their broad range, including both closed and open ones and wet and dry ones. Often, the largest numbers are found in rocky areas with access to water. They often reside in coniferous or pine-oak forests as well as timbered canyonland, hilly riverine woods, dry open boscage and scrub, humid forests and overgrown marshes. They may forage over ranches and even semi-desert, but always need at least scattered tree thickets for nesting. They may be distributed in elevation from sea level to , though are mainly found below in the north and below in the southern reaches of the breeding range. Behaviour and ecology Turkey Vulture (The zone-tailed hawk bears a superficial resemblance to the turkey vulture, pictured here in flight.) The bird's flight feathers closely resembles those of the turkey vulture. Zone- tailed hawks soar with their wings held in a dihedral position (pointing slightly upwards), rocking from side to side, a flight style that parallels that of turkey vultures. Bird guides caution against confusing them with the much more common turkey vulture, but at a reasonable distance one can distinguish them from vultures by their smaller size, the typical hawk shape of the wings and head, and the pale stripe on the tail. Since vultures frequently can be seen flying in numbers (groups are called \\"kettles\\"), zone- tailed hawks can mingle with them and are perhaps most often missed by the human eye in such kettles. =Breeding= The mating season of the species varies geographically but is almost always in the first half of the year. In the northern reaches of the range, the breeding season is mid-April through July, whereas in Trinidad and Ecuador, it is February through June. Eggs have been found as late as August in Colombia, implying an only loose breeding season in the true tropics. The mating pair perform a courtship display, which may include engaging in aerial loops, dives and rolls with each other. The nest is typical of hawks: a big, bulky assemblage of sticks, lined with green leaves, usually built in the top or in the main fork of a tree, in this case at above the ground. Typically, tall trees such as a cottonwood or pine tree are selected, and the nest may be in the open or concealed by foliage. Occasionally, nests are found on cliffs. The clutch comprises one to three, typically two, white eggs, often marked with brown. Incubation lasts for around 28 to 35 days and typically the female incubates, while being fed by the male, although the male may occasionally incubate. The young are semi- altricial at hatching and are covered in gray down. They grow slowly for the first 7 days of life and then considerably faster from 7 to 21 days old. As is common in raptors the older sibling often kills the younger one or outcompetes it for food; only occasionally do both survive to adulthood. The younger hatchling is sometimes referred to as the \\"spare\\" one since it may be tended to more directly if the first dies. The young fledge at 42 to 50 days, though are not typically self-assured fliers until around a week later. They may remain in their parents' care until the following breeding season, though in migratory populations, the young and adults often separate. There have been no extensive reports on longevity and mortality in the species. =Food and feeding= Unlike turkey vultures that do not normally prey on live animals, zone-tailed hawks are active predators. Therefore, some ornithologists believe that this mimicry tricks potential prey animals into not being alarmed when a zone-tail flies overhead. This hawk mainly preys on small birds and mammals (including bats), but reptiles can be locally favored, including virtually any type of lizard. In the north, California quail, along with possibly other quail species, and chipmunks seemed to be the favorite prey. Zone-tails also eat various young birds, having been observed preying on nestlings and fledglings of species as varied as herons and passerines. Zone-tailed hawks snatch young birds from trees or the ground without landing. Second-hand reports of predation on frogs and fishes may be cases of misidentification of common black-hawks. Zone-tailed hawks are very active foragers, hunting almost exclusively by transects and random quartering in low flight at around over the ground. When approaching the prey, the hawk may try to use obstructing cover such as trees until it is within of the prey, easy striking distance. Outside the breeding pair bond, these hawks are wholly solitary and are not known to hunt in pairs.

He had tutored Samson Occom, a Mohegan who became a Presbyterian minister and the first Native American to publish writings in English. Before founding Dartmouth, Wheelock had founded and run the Moor's Charity School in Connecticut to educate Native Americans. The college was primarily for the sons of English colonists. Early life and education Eleazar Wheelock was born in Windham, Connecticut, to Ralph Wheelock and Ruth Huntington, who had a prosperous farm of 300 acres. He is the great-grandson of the first teacher of the first free school in the United States (see Dedham, Massachusetts), the Rev. Ralph Wheelock. In 1733, he graduated from Yale College, having won the first award of the Dean Berkeley Donation for distinction in classics. He continued his theological studies at Yale until he was licensed to preach in May 1734. Marriage and family Two months after beginning as pastor of a church, on April 29, 1735, he married Sarah Davenport. She died in 1746. They managed a farm in addition to his pastoring, and he was an itinerant preacher during the 1730s and '40s. He married a second time to Mary Brinsmead, a widow with two children. In total he had eight children with his wives and two step- children.Alex de Sherbinin, \\"Eleazar Wheelock: The Man and His Legacy\\", 2011, Columbia University, Creative Commons, accessed 29 March 2013 Career Wheelock was installed as the pastor of the Second Congregational Church of Lebanon, Connecticut, in February 1735 and served as their minister for 34 years. Wheelock also acted as an itinerant preacher during the Great Awakening, a religious revival that had begun to sweep the Connecticut River Valley around the time of his graduation from Yale. He was one of its greatest proponents in the state, serving as the \\"chief intelligencer of revival news\\". In addition, Wheelock was deeply concerned about Native Americans in New England, whose numbers had declined rapidly due to disease, warfare and social disruption, including continued encroachment on their lands by colonists. Wheelock \\"was a long-time slave owner\\". Christian missionary In 1743, Wheelock took in a student named Samson Occom, a Mohegan who knew English and had converted to Christianity in his childhood. He taught Occom for four years; the youth was a ready student, learning to read and write in Hebrew as well as deeply studying theology. After preaching for several years to the Pequot people in Montauk on eastern Long Island, Occom was ordained in Suffolk County, New York, as a Presbyterian minister. He returned to Connecticut to preach to the Mohegan and later organized Christian Indians as the Brothertown Indians. Wheelock's success in preparing Occom for the ministry encouraged him to found a school in Lebanon, Connecticut, for Native Americans. He planned to teach the boys in both secular and Christian subjects, so they could return to their native culture as missionaries. The girls would learn \\"housewifery\\" and English skills including reading and writing. Charitable contributions from New England and England supported the Moor's Charity School, which was located on Lebanon's town green. Some students became homesick or even ill and died; few became missionaries. Establishment of Dartmouth and presidency After sending Occom and another minister on a speaking tour of England to raise money for the charity school, Wheelock decided to enlarge it, as well as adding college classes for the education of English colonists in the classics, philosophy, and literature. He began to search for another location for the schools. Wheelock obtained a charter from King George III on December 13, 1769. Having worked and raised funds for the education of Native Americans, Occom and the British Board of Trustees headed by Lord Dartmouth opposed the addition of the college to benefit colonists' sons. Wheelock kept the lord's donation and named the college after him, as Dartmouth College. He chose Hanover, New Hampshire, for the location and became the college's president. In 1771, four students were graduated in Dartmouth's first commencement, including Wheelock's son John. While some Native Americans attended Dartmouth, it primarily served the sons of English colonists. Wheelock died during the Revolutionary War, on April 24, 1779. He is buried in Hanover. His writings include \\"Narrative of the Indian School at Lebanon.\\" Legacy and honors *Wheelock, Vermont, in Caledonia County is named for him. *During World War II a Liberty Ship (Maritime Hull Number 0038) was named for Wheelock.

The vessel is best known for its role in hunting down the Bounty mutineers in 1790. Pandora was partially successful by capturing 14 of the mutineers, but wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef on the return voyage in 1791. HMS Pandora is considered to be one of the most significant shipwrecks in the Southern Hemisphere. Early service Pandoras first service was in the Channel during the 1779 threatened invasion by the combined fleets of France and Spain. The ship was deployed in North American waters during the American War Of Independence and saw service as a convoy escort between England and Quebec. On 18 July 1780, while under the command of Captain Anthony Parry, Pandora and captured the American privateer Jack. Then on 2 September, the two British vessels captured the American privateer Terrible. On 14 January Pandora captured the brig Janie. Then on 11 March she captured the ship Mercury. Two days later Pandora and were off the Capes of Virginia when they captured the sloop Louis, which had been sailing to Virginia with a cargo of cider and onions. Under Captain John Inglis Pandora captured more merchant vessels. The first was the brig Lively on 24 May 1782. More followed: the ship Mercury and the sloops Port Royal and Superb (22 November 1782), the brig Nestor (3 February 1783), and the ship Financier (29 March). At the end of the American war the Admiralty placed Pandora in ordinary (mothballed) in 1783 at Chatham for seven years.  Voyage in search of the Bounty  Pandora was ordered to be brought back into service on 30 June 1790 when war between England and Spain seemed likely due to the Nootka Crisis. However, in early August 1790, 5 months after learning of the mutiny on HMS Bounty, the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, decided to despatch the ship to recover the Bounty, capture the mutineers, and return them to England for trial.HMS Pandora's Logbook (Adm. MS 180) entry for Wednesday 11 August 1790 in: Gesner, 2016:80 Pandora was refitted, and her 9-pounder guns were reduced to 20 in number, though an extra four 18-pounder carronades were added. Pandora sailed from The Solent on 7 November 1790, commanded by Captain Edward Edwards and manned by a crew of 134 men. With his crew was Thomas Hayward, who had been on the Bounty at the time of the mutiny, and left with Bligh in the open boat. At Tahiti they were also assisted by John Brown, who had been left on the island by an English merchant ship, The Mercury. Unknown to Edwards, twelve of the mutineers, together with four crew who had stayed loyal to Bligh, had by then already elected to return to Tahiti, after a failed attempt to establish a colony (Fort St George) under Fletcher Christian's leadership on Tubuai, one of the Austral Islands. The disaffected men were living in Tahiti as 'beachcombers', many of them having fathered children with local women. Fletcher Christian's group of mutineers and their Polynesian followers had sailed off and eventually established their settlement on the then uncharted Pitcairn Island. By the time of Pandoras arrival, fourteen of the former Bounty men remained on Tahiti, Charles Churchill having been murdered in a quarrel with Matthew Thompson, who was in turn killed by Polynesians, who considered Churchill their king. The Pandora reached Tahiti on 23 March 1791 via Cape Horn. Three men came out and surrendered to Edwards shortly after Pandoras arrival. These were Joseph Coleman, the Bountys armourer, and Peter Heywood and George Stewart, midshipmen. Edwards then dispatched search parties to round up the remainder. Able Seaman Richard Skinner was apprehended the day after Pandoras arrival. By now alerted to Edwards' presence, the other Bounty men fled to the mountains while James Morrison, Charles Norman and Thomas Ellison, tried to reach the Pandora to surrender in the escape boat they had built. All were eventually captured, and brought back to Pandora on 29 March. An eighth man, the half blind Michael Byrne, who had been fiddler aboard Bounty, had also come aboard by this time. It was not recorded whether he had been captured or had handed himself in. Edwards conducted further searches over the next week and a half, and on Saturday two more men were brought aboard Pandora, Henry Hilbrant and Thomas McIntosh. The remaining four men, Thomas Burkett, John Millward, John Sumner and William Muspratt, were brought in the following day. These fourteen men were locked up in a makeshift prison cell, measuring eleven-by-eighteen feet, on the Pandora's quarter-deck, which they called \\"Pandora's Box\\". On 8 May 1791 the Pandora left Tahiti and subsequently spent three months visiting islands in the South-West Pacific in search of the Bounty and the remaining mutineers, without finding any traces of the pirated vessel. During this part of the voyage fourteen crew went missing in two of the ship's boats. Nine of them were on the Matavy, a schooner built by Bounty crew members and called by them Resolution. It had been commandeered to serve as a ship's tender but lost sight of Pandora near Tutuila at night. By chance, during their voyage to Batavia these nine became the first Europeans to make contact with the people of Fiji. See the journal of Renouard, Midshipman David Thomas: Voyage of the Pandora's tender (1791) reprinted in: Maxton, 2020:143-156 In the meantime the Pandora visited Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and Rotuma. They also passed Vanikoro Island, which Edwards named Pitt's Island; but they did not stop to explore the island and investigate obvious signs of habitation. If they had done so, they would very probably have discovered early evidence of the fate of the French Pacific explorer La Perouse's expedition which had disappeared in 1788. From later accounts about their fate it is evident that a substantial number of crew survived the cyclone that wrecked their ships Astrolabe and Boussole on Vanikoro's fringing reef.  Wrecked  Heading west, making for the Torres Strait, the ship ran aground on 29 August 1791 on the outer Great Barrier Reef. Pandora sank the next morning, claiming the lives of 35 men - 31 crew and 4 of the mutineers. The four prisoners lost were George Stewart; John Sumner; Richard Skinner; and Henry Hillbrandt (according to one history they drowned because their hands were still manacled; James Morrison's hands were also manacled but he survived.)The eventual History of the Mutiny on HMS Bounty [1831The True story of the Mutiny on the Bounty by Rutter Owen reports that Hillbrandt was lost when he couldn't get out of the \\"Pandora's Box\\"; Stewart and Summer were killed by a falling gangway; Skinner still manacled drowned; The remainder of the ship's company (89 crew and 10 prisoners, 7 of whom were released from their cell as the ship sank) assembled on a small treeless sand cay. After two nights on the island they sailed for Timor in four open boats, making a stop on Muralag (Prince of Wales Island) in the Torres Strait seeking fresh water. They arrived in Kupang on 16 September 1791 after an arduous voyage across the Arafura Sea. Sixteen more died after surviving the wreck, many having fallen ill during their sojourn in Batavia (Jakarta). Eventually only 78 of the 134 men who had been on board upon departure returned home. Captain Edwards and his officers were exonerated for the loss of the Pandora after a court martial. No attempt was made by the colonial authorities in New South Wales to salvage material from the wreck. The ten surviving prisoners were also tried; the various courts martial held acquitted four of those of mutiny and, although the other six were convicted, three were executed - Millward, Burkitt and Ellison who were executed on 29 October 1792 on board the man-of-war Brunswick at Portsmouth. Peter Heywood and James Morrison received a Royal pardon, while William Muspratt was acquitted on a legal technicality. Descendants of the nine mutineers not discovered by Pandora still live on Pitcairn Island, the refuge Fletcher Christian founded in January 1790 and where they burnt and scuttled the Bounty a few weeks after arrival. Their hiding place was not discovered until 1808 when the New England sealer Topaz (Captain Mayhew Folger) happened on the tiny uncharted island. By then, all of the mutineers – except John Adams (aka Alexander Smith) – were dead, most having died under violent circumstances. Wreck site: discovery and archaeology The wreck of the Pandora is located approximately 5 km north-west of Moulter Cay on the outer Great Barrier Reef, on the edge of the Coral Sea. It is one of the best preserved shipwrecks in Australian waters. Its discovery was made on 15 November 1977 by independent explorers Ben Cropp, Steve Domm and John Heyer. John Heyer, an Australian documentary film maker, had predicted the position of the wreck based on his research in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. His discovery expedition was launched with the help of Steve Domm, a boat owner and naturalist, and the Royal Australian Air Force. Using the built-in sensors of the RAAF P-2V Neptune, the magnetic anomaly caused by the wreck was detected and flares were laid down near the coordinates predicted by John Heyer. Ben Cropp, an Australian television film maker, gained knowledge of Heyer's expedition and decided to launch his own search with the intention of following Heyer by boat; In this way Ben Cropp found the Pandora wreck just before John Heyer's boat did. The wreck was actually sighted by a diver called Ron Bell on Ben Cropp's boat. After the wreck site was located it was immediately declared a protected site under the Australian Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, and in 1978 Ben Cropp and Steve Domm shared the $10,000. reward for finding the wreck. The Queensland Museum excavated the wreck on nine occasions between 1983 and 1999, according to a research design devised by marine archaeologists at the West Australian and Queensland museums (Gesner, 2016:16). Archaeologists, historians and scholars at the Museum of Tropical Queensland, Townsville, continue to piece together the Pandora story, using archaeological and extant historical evidence. A large collection of artefacts is on display at the museum. In the course of the nine seasons of excavation during the 1980s and 1990s, the museum's marine archaeological teams established that approximately 30% of the hull is still intact (Gesner, 2000:39ff). The vessel came to rest at a depth of between 30 and 33 m on a gently sloping sandy bottom, slightly inclined to starboard; consequently more of the starboard side has been preserved than the port side of the hull. Approximately one third of the seabed in which the wreck is buried has been excavated by the Queensland Museum, leaving approximately 350 m³ for any future excavations.

L. Caragiale; According to his birth certificate, published and discussed by Constantin Popescu-Cadem in Manuscriptum, Vol. VIII, Nr. 2, 1977, p.179-184 – 9 June 1912) was a Wallachian, later Romanian playwright, short story writer, poet, theater manager, political commentator and journalist. Leaving behind an important cultural legacy, he is considered one of the greatest playwrights in Romanian language and literature, as well as one of its most important writers and a leading representative of local humour. Alongside Mihai Eminescu, Ioan Slavici and Ion Creangă, he is seen as one of the main representatives of Junimea, an influential literary society with which he nonetheless parted during the second half of his life. His work, spanning four decades, covers the ground between Neoclassicism, Realism, and Naturalism, building on an original synthesis of foreign and local influences. Although few in number, Caragiale's plays constitute the most accomplished expression of Romanian theater, as well as being important venues for criticism of late-19th-century Romanian society. They include the comedies O noapte furtunoasă, Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea, O scrisoare pierdută, and the tragedy Năpasta. In addition to these, Caragiale authored the melodrama O soacră, a large number of essays, articles, short stories, novellas and sketch stories, as well as occasional works of poetry and autobiographical texts such as Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur. In many cases, his creations were first published in one of several magazines he edited—Claponul, Moftul Român, Vatra and Epoca. Most of his prose works have been published under the title Momente şi schiţe: they include Căldură mare, Cănuţă om sucit, Două loturi, Grand Hotel \\"Victoria română\\", as well as several pieces referring to stock characters such as Lache and Mache, Marius Chicoş Rostogan and Mitică. In some of his later fiction writings, including La hanul lui Mânjoală, Kir Ianulea, Abu-Hasan, Pastramă trufanda and Calul dracului, Caragiale adopted the fantasy genre or turned to historical fiction. Ion Luca Caragiale was interested in the politics of the Romanian Kingdom, and oscillated between the liberal current and conservatism. Most of his satirical works target the liberal republicans and the National Liberals, evidencing both his respect for their rivals at Junimea and his connections with the literary critic Titu Maiorescu. He came to clash with National Liberal leaders such as Dimitrie Sturdza and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, and was a lifelong adversary of the Symbolist poet Alexandru Macedonski. As a result of these conflicts, the most prominent of Caragiale's critics barred his access to the cultural establishment for several decades. During the 1890s, Caragiale rallied with the radical movement of George Panu, before associating with the Conservative Party. After having decided to settle in Berlin, he came to voice strong criticism for Romanian politicians of all colours in the wake of the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, and ultimately joined the Conservative- Democratic Party. He was both a friend and rival to writers such as Eminescu, Maiorescu, and Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, while maintaining contacts with, among others, the Junimist essayist Iacob Negruzzi, the socialist philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the literary critic Paul Zarifopol, the poets George Coşbuc and Mite Kremnitz, the psychologist Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, and the Transylvanian poet and activist Octavian Goga. Ion Luca was the nephew of Costache and Iorgu Caragiale, who were major figures of mid-19th century Romanian theatre. His sons Mateiu and Luca were both modernist writers. Biography =Background and name= Ion Luca Caragiale was born into a family of Greek descent, whose members first arrived in Wallachia soon after 1812, during the rule of Prince Ioan Gheorghe Caragea—Ştefan Caragiali, as his grandfather was known locally, worked as a cook for the court in Bucharest.

Known to locals as Luca Caragiali, he later built a reputation as a lawyer and judge in Ploieşti, and married Ecaterina, the daughter of a merchant from the Transylvanian town of Braşov.Vianu, Vol. II, p.176 Georgeta Ene, , in Magazin Istoric, January 2002, p.12-17 Her maiden name was given as Alexovici (Alexevici) or as Karaboa (Caraboa).Mîndra, p.6, 272 She is known to have been Greek herself, Ioan Holban, \\"I.L. Caragiale, fiul unui emigrant din Cefallonia (III)\\", in Evenimentul, 25 May 2002 and, according to historian Lucian Nastasă, some of her relatives were Hungarian members of the Tabay family. The Caragiali couple also had a daughter, named Lenci.Cioculescu, p.18, 308 Ion Luca's uncles, Costache and Iorgu Caragiale, also known as Caragiali, managed theater troupes and were very influential figures in the development of early Romanian theater—in Wallachia and Moldavia alike.Cazimir (1967), p.73-76; Cioculescu, p.6-7; Mîndra, p.5-6; Perpessicius, p.237; Vianu, Vol. II, p.176Dan Mănucă, \\"Caragiale\\", in Jean-Claude Polet, Patrimoine littéraire européen: anthologie en langue française, De Boeck Université, Paris, 2000, p.478-479. Luca Caragiali had himself performed with his brothers during his youth, before opting to settle down.Cioculescu, p.300-301; Mîndra, p.5-6; Vianu, Vol. II, p.176 All three had stood criticism for not taking part in the Wallachian Revolution, and defended themselves through a brochure printed in 1848.Cioculescu, p.300-301 The brothers Caragiali had two sisters, Ecaterina and Anastasia. Doina Tudorovici \\"Caragiale: «ai avesi, tomnilor, cu numele meu?»\\", in Ziarul Financiar, 5 July 2000 Especially in his old age, the writer emphasized his family's humble background and his status as a self-made man.Cioculescu, p.14, 29; Mîndra, p.5; Vianu, Vol. II, p.197-198; Vol.III, p.74 On one occasion, he defined the landscape of his youth as \\"the quagmires of Ploieşti\\".Vianu, Vol. II, p.197 Although it prompted his biographer Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea to define him as \\"a proletarian\\", Caragiale's account was disputed by several other researchers, who noted that the family had a good social standing. Ion Luca Caragiale was discreet about his ethnic origin for the larger part of his life. In parallel, his foreign roots came to the attention of his adversaries, who used them as arguments in various polemics.Cioculescu, p.124-125Sorin Antohi, \\"Romania and the Balkans. From Geocultural Bovarism to Ethnic Ontology\\", in Tr@nsit online, Nr. 21/2002, Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen As his relations with Caragiale degenerated into hostility, Mihai Eminescu is known to have referred to his former friend as \\"that Greek swindler\\".Cristea-Enache, chapter \\"Corespondenţa inedită Mihai Eminescu – Veronica Micle. Filigranul geniului\\" Aware of such treatment, the writer considered all references to his lineage to be insults. On several occasions, he preferred to indicate that he was \\"of obscure birth\\". Balkan costume, photographed ca. 1900 Nevertheless, as literary critic Tudor Vianu noted, Caragiale's outlook on life was explicitly Balkanic and Oriental, which, in Vianu's view, mirrored a type \\"which must have been found in his lineage\\".Vianu, Vol. II, p.195 A similar opinion was expressed by Paul Zarifopol, who speculated that Caragiale's conservative mindset was possibly owed to the \\"lazyness of one true Oriental\\" Paul Zarifopol, Introduceri la ediţia critică I.L. Caragiale, opere (wikisource) (elsewhere, he referred to the writer as \\"a lazy southerner, fitted with definitely supranormal intelligence and imagination\\"). Paul Zarifopol, Artişti şi idei literare române: Publicul şi arta lui Caragiale (wikisource) In his main work on the history of Romanian literature, George Călinescu included Caragiale among a group of \\"Balkan\\" writers, whose middle class status and often foreign origin, he argued, set them apart irrespective of their period—others in this category were, in chronological order, Anton Pann, Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu, Urmuz, Mateiu Caragiale, and Ion Barbu.Cazimir (1967), p.53-54 In contrast, critic Garabet Ibrăileanu proposed that Caragiale's Wallachian origin was of particular importance, serving to explain his political choices and alleged social bias. Garabet Ibrăileanu, Spiritul critic în cultura românească: Spiritul critic în Muntenia – Critica socială extremă: Caragiale (wikisource) On one occasion, Caragiale mentioned that his paternal grandfather was \\"a Greek cook\\". In several contexts, he referred to his roots as being in the island of Hydra. In one of his photographs, he posed in Oriental costume and sitting cross-legged, which was interpreted by Vianu as an additional reference to his Balkan background.Vianu, Vol. I, p.308 Two of his biographers, Zarifopol and Şerban Cioculescu, noted that a section of Caragiale's fairy tale Kir Ianulea was a likely self-reference: in that fragment of text, the Christian Devil, disguised as an Arvanite trader, is shown taking pride in his Romanian language skills.Cioculescu, p.204-205 Investigations carried out by the Center of Theatric Research in Athens, Greece and made public in 2002 offered an alternative take on the Caragiales' origin. According to this perspective, Ştefan Caragiali was a native of Kefalonia, and his original surname, Karaialis, was changed on Prince Caragea's request. Various authors also believe that Caragiale's ancestors were Albanian or Aromanian.David Binder, \\"Vlachs: a Peaceful Balkan People\\", in Mediterranean Quarterly, Volume 15, Number 4, Fall 2004 Originally, Ion Luca was known as Ioanne L. Caragiali.Mîndra, p.7 \\"Casele lui Caragiale\\" , in Adevărul, 30 January 2002 His family and friends knew him as Iancu or, rarely, Iancuţu—both being antiquated hypocoristics of Ion.Mîndra, p.6 The definitive full version of his features the syllable ca twice in a row, which is generally avoided in Romanian due to its scatological connotations. It has however become one of the few cacophonies accepted by the Romanian Academy.Alexandru Vlad, \\"Gramatica diavolului\\", in Vatra, 3-4/2005, p.2 =Early years= The adolescent Caragiale Born in the village of Haimanale, Prahova County (the present-day I. L. Caragiale commune, Dâmboviţa County), Caragiale was educated in Ploieşti. During his early years, as he later indicated, he learned reading and writing with a teacher at the Romanian Orthodox Church of Saint George.Mîndra, p.272 Soon after, he was taught literary Romanian by the Transylvanian-born Bazilie Dragoşescu (whose influence on his use of the language he was to acknowledge in one of his later works).Cioculescu, p.126; Vianu, Vol. II, p.176 At the age of seven, he witnessed enthusiastic celebrations of the Danubian Principalities' union, with the election of Moldavia's Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Prince of Wallachia;Vianu, Vol. II, p.192 Cuza's subsequent reforms were to be an influence on the political choices Caragiale made in his old age. The new ruler visited his primary school later in 1859, being received with enthusiasm by Dragoşescu and all his pupils.Cioculescu, p.126 Caragiale completed gymnasium at the Sfinţii Petru şi Pavel school in the city, and never pursued any form of higher education.Mîndra, p.272; Vianu, Vol. II, p.176 He was probably enlisted directly in the second grade, as records do not show him to have attended or graduated the first year.Mîndra, p.6-8, 272 Notably, Caragiale was taught history by Constantin Iennescu, who was later the mayor of Ploieşti.Mîndra, p.9 The young Caragiale opted to follow in his uncles' footsteps, and was taught declamation and mimic art by Costache at the latter's theater school in Bucharest, where he was accompanied by his mother and sister.Cioculescu, p.6-7; Mîndra, p.8, 272; Vianu, Vol. II, p.176 It is also probable that he was a supernumerary actor for the National Theater Bucharest. He was not able to find full employment in this field, and, around the age of 18, worked as a copyist for the Prahova County Tribunal.Mîndra, p.8, 272; Vianu, Vol. II, p.177 Throughout his life, Caragiale refused to talk about his training in the theater, and hid it from the people closest to him (including his wife Alexandrina Burelly, who came from an upper middle class environment).Cioculescu, p.6 In 1866, Caragiale witnessed Cuza's toppling by a coalition of conservatives and liberals—as he later acknowledged in his Grand Hotel \\"Victoria Română\\", he and his friends agreed to support the move by voting \\"yes\\" during a subsequent plebiscite, and, with tacit approval from the new authorities, even did so several times each.Cioculescu, p.55; Ornea, p.213 By the age of 18, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the liberal current, and sympathized with its republican ideals. In 1871, he witnessed the Republic of Ploieşti—a short-lived stated created by the liberal groups, in an attempt to oust Domnitor Carol I (the future King of Romania).Cioculescu, p.8, 18–19, 270–271; Mîndra, p.8; Ornea, p.216 Later in life, as his opinions veered towards conservatism, Caragiale ridiculed both the attempted coup d'état and his participation in it.Cazimir (1967), p.128; Cioculescu, p.18-19, 270–271; Ornea, p.215-216 He returned to Bucharest later that year, after manager Mihail Pascaly hired him as one of the prompts at the National Theater in the capital, a period about which he reminisced in his Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur.Mîndra, p.9, 272; Vianu, Vol. II, p.177 The poet Mihai Eminescu, with whom Ion Luca was to have cordial relations as well as rivalries, had previously been employed for the same position by the manager Iorgu Caragiale.Perpessicius, p.150, 190, 235–236, 290–291; Vianu, Vol. II, p.176, 177 In addition to his growing familiarity with the repertoire, the young Caragiale educated himself by reading the philosophical works of Enlightenment-era philosophes. It was also recorded that, at some point between 1870 and 1872, he was employed in the same capacity by the Moldavian National Theater in Iaşi.Mîndra, p.9, 272 During the period, Caragiale also proofread for various publications and worked as a tutor. =Literary debut= Caragiale in his youth Ion Luca made his literary debut in 1873, at the age of 21, with poems and humorous chronicles printed in G. Dem. Teodorescu's liberal-inspired satirical magazine Ghimpele. He published relatively few articles under various pen names—among them Car., the contraction of his family name, and the more elaborate Palicar.Cioculescu, p.60 He mostly performed basic services for the editorial staff and its printing press, given that, after Luca Caragiali died in 1870, he was the sole provider for his mother and sister.Cioculescu, p.18, 60; Mîndra, p.9 Following his return to Bucharest, he became even more involved with the radical and republican wing of the liberal trend—a movement commonly referred to as \\"the Reds\\". As he later confessed, he frequently attended its congresses, witnessing the speeches held by Reds leader C. A. Rosetti; he thus became intimately acquainted with a Populist discourse, which he later parodied in his works.Cioculescu, p.19-21; Ornea, p.205-206, 209–217 Working for Ghimpele, he made the acquaintance of republican writer N. T. Orăşanu.Mîndra, p.273 Several of his articles for Ghimpele were sarcastic in tone, and targeted various literary figures of the day. In June 1874, Caragiale amused himself at the expense of N. D. Popescu-Popnedea, the author of popular almanacs, whose taste he questioned.Cioculescu, p.52 Soon after, he ridiculed the rising poet Alexandru Macedonski, who had publicized his claim that he was a \\"Count Geniadevsky\\", and thus of Polish origin.Cioculescu, p.52-53; Vianu, Vol. II, p.177 The article contributed by Caragiale, in which he speculated that Macedonski (referred to with the anagram Aamsky) was using the name solely because it reminded people of the word \\"genius\\",Vianu, Vol. II, p.177 was the first act in a long polemic between the two literary figures. Caragiale turned Aamsky into a character on his own, envisaging his death as a result of overwork in editing magazines \\"for the country's political development\\". Caragiale also contributed poetry to Ghimpele: two sonnets, and a series of epigrams (one of which was another attack on Macedonski).Cioculescu, p.60-61 The first of these works, an 1873 sonnet dedicated to baritone Agostino Mazzoli, is believed to have been his first contribution to the belles-lettres (as opposed to journalism).Perpessicius, p.50 In 1896, Macedonski reflected with irony: > \\"As early as 1872, the clients of some beer gardens in the capital have had > the occasion to welcome among them of a noisy young man, a bizarre spirit > who seemed destined, were he to have devoted himself to letters or the arts, > to be entirely original. Indeed, this young man's appearance, his hasty > gestures, his sarcastic smile [...], his always irritated and mocking voice, > as well as his sophistic reasoning easily attracted attention.\\" Over the following years, Caragiale collaborated on various mouthpieces of the newly created National Liberal Party, and, in May 1877, created the satirical magazine Claponul.Cioculescu, p.17-21; Mîndra, p.9, 273; Vianu, Vol. II, p.177-178 Later in 1877, he also translated a series of French-language plays for the National Theater: Alexandre Parodi's Rome vaincue (it was showcased in late 1877-early 1878),Mîndra, p.10, 273; Vianu, Vol. II, p.178 Paul Déroulède's L'Hetman, and Eugène Scribe's Une camaraderie.Vianu, Vol. II, p.178 Together with the French republican Frédéric Damé, he also headed a short-lived journal, Naţiunea Română.Cioculescu, p.186-187; Mîndra, p.9 It was also then that he contributed a serialized overview of Romanian theater, published by the newspaper România Liberă, in which Caragiale attacked the inferiority of Romanian dramaturgy and the widespread recourse to plagiarism.Cioculescu, p.92; Perpessicius, p.238-239; Vianu, Vol. II, p.178 According to literary historian Perpessicius, the series constituted \\"one of the most solid critical contributions to the history of our theater\\".Perpessicius, p.238-239 Macedonski later alleged that, in his contributions to the liberal newspapers, the young writer had libeled several Conservative Party politicians—when researching this period, Şerban Cioculescu concluded that the accusation was false, and that only one polemical article on a political topic could be traced back to Caragiale.Cioculescu, p.18-19, 59–60, 59–60 =Timpul and Claponul= Russian Army in Bucharest, print in The Illustrated London News (1877) The young journalist began drifting away from National Liberal politics soon after 1876, when the group came to power with Ion Brătianu as Premier.Cioculescu, p.20 According to many versions, Eminescu, who was working on the editorial staff of the main Conservative newspaper, Timpul, asked to be joined by Caragiale and the Transylvanian prose writer Ioan Slavici, who were both employed by the paper.Ornea, p.200; Mîndra, p.273; Vianu, Vol. II, p.147, 178, 224–225 This order of events remains unclear, and depends on sources saying that Eminescu was employed by the paper in March 1876.Ornea, p.246 Other testimonies indicate that it was actually Eminescu who arrived last, beginning work in January 1878. Slavici later recalled that three of them engaged in lengthy discussions at Timpul's headquarters on Calea Victoriei and in Eminescu's house on Sfinţilor Street, where they planned to co-author a massive work on Romanian grammar. According to literary historian Tudor Vianu, the relationship between Caragiale and Eminescu partly replicated that between the latter and the Moldavian Ion Creangă. Over that period, Timpul and Eminescu were engaged in a harsh polemic with the Reds, and especially their leader Rosetti.Vianu, Vol. II, p.147 It was also then that Romania entered the Russo-Turkish War as a means to secure her complete independence from the Ottoman Empire. Caragiale reportedly took little interest in editing Timpul over that period, but it is assumed that several unsigned chronicles, covering foreign events, are his contributions (as are two short story adaptations of works by the American author Edgar Allan Poe, both published by Timpul in spring-summer 1878). The newspaper was actually issued as a collaborative effort, which makes it hard to identify the authors of many other articles.Ornea, p.246-247 According to Slavici, Caragiale occasionally completed unfinished contributions by Eminescu whenever the latter had to leave unexpectedly.Ornea, p.247 He concentrated instead on Claponul, which he edited and wrote single-handedly for the duration of the war.Cioculescu, p.53 Zarifopol believed that, through the series of light satires he contributed for the magazine, Caragiale was trying out his style, and thus \\"entertaining the suburbanites, in order to study them\\". A piece he authored of the time featured an imaginary barber and amateur artist, Năstase Ştirbu, who drew a direct parallel between art, literature and cutting hair—both the theme and the character were to be reused in his later works.Cioculescu, p.53-54 Similarly, a fragment of prose referring to two inseparable friends, Şotrocea and Motrocea, was to serve as the first draft for the Lache and Mache series in Momente şi schiţe. Another notable work of the time is Pohod la şosea, a rhyming reportage documenting the Russian Army's arrival to Bucharest, and the street reactions to the event.Cioculescu, p.62 Claponul ceased publication in early 1878.Mîndra, p.10 =Junimea reception= It was probably through Eminescu that Ion Luca Caragiale came into contact with the Iaşi-based Junimea, the influential literary society which was also a center for anti-National Liberal politics. Initially, Caragiale met with Junimea founder, the critic and politician Titu Maiorescu, during a visit to the house of Dr. Kremnitz, physician to the family of Domnitor Carol I.Vianu, Vol. II, p.178-179 The doctor's wife and Maiorescu's sister-in-law, Mite Kremnitz, was herself a writer, and later became Eminescu's lover.Vianu, Vol. II, p.66, 150 During several meetings, Caragiale was asked by Maiorescu to write down a series of aphorisms in an album. His concise musings are contemplative in tone, and some of them constitute evidence of both misanthropyCioculescu, p.75; Vianu, Vol. II, p.178-179 and, to a certain degree, misogyny.Cioculescu, p.76 In 1878, Caragiale and Maiorescu left for Iaşi, where they attended Junimea 's 15th anniversary, and where Caragiale read his first draft of the celebrated play O noapte furtunoasă.Vianu, Vol. II, p.9, 179 The work, ridiculing the petite bourgeoisie 's mix of liberal values and demagogy over a background of superficial culture, immediately struck a chord with the majority-conservative grouping.Vianu, Vol. II, p.61, 179–180 Its reception was one of the pivotal moments in the second period of Junimea activities, characterized by the society's expansion to Bucharest and its patronage of the arts.Vianu, Vol.I, p.397-398; Vol. II, p.9, 110, 136–137 Other writers who marked this stage were Creangă, Slavici, Vasile Alecsandri and Vasile Conta—together with Caragiale, they soon became the foremost representatives of Junimea 's direct influence on literature.Ornea, p.151-258; Vianu, Vol. I, p.305, 398; Vol. II, p.9, 136–137, 221 To varying degrees, they all complimented the main element of Junimist discourse, Maiorescu criticism of \\"forms without a foundation\\"—the concept itself referred to the negative impact of modernization, which, Junimea argued, had by then only benefited the upper strata of Romanian society, leaving the rest with an incomplete and increasingly falsified culture.Ornea, p.151-258; Vianu, Vol. II, p.19 Ion Luca Caragiale also associated with Junimea's mouthpiece, Convorbiri Literare, and continued to contribute there even after 1885, when the society began to decline in importance.Vianu, Vol. II, p.10, 61 It was here that all his major comedies were first presented to the public. He did not, however, join Petre P. Carp's movement, which aimed to consolidate Junimea as a third force in Romanian politics, and remained a staunch independent over the following years.Cioculescu, p.21 Caragiale was nevertheless associated with the Junimist journal Constituţionalul.Ornea, p.200 In early January 1879, O noapte furtunoasă was first staged by the National Theater.Cioculescu, p.184-186; Mîndra, p.273; Vianu, Vol. II, p.180 Its production brought the first association between Caragiale and comedian Mihai Mateescu, who went on to portray some of his most popular characters.Cioculescu, p.186 The play was a hit, and acclaim reached Caragiale despite the fact that he had refused to have his name printed on the posters.Cioculescu, p.184-185 Caragiale was soon outraged to discover that, by the second staging, his text had been toned down by the government-appointed Head of Theaters, the National Liberal Ion Ghica.Vianu, Vol. II, p.180, 186, 190 When he asked for an official explanation, O noapte furtunoasă was removed from the season's program.Cioculescu, p.190-191; Vianu, Vol. II, p.180, 186 Over the following years, independent troupes staged the play or its plagiarized versions for their own benefit.Cioculescu, p.186, 191–194 It was restored to the National Theater's repertoire in 1883, and was so successful that state theaters in cities such as Craiova and Iaşi made efforts to have it included in their own programs.Cioculescu, p.190-191 Caragiale subsequently took part in directing his plays at the National Theater, where his main collaborator was actor and manager Constantin I. Nottara.Cioculescu, p.323 Together, they are credited with having put a stop to the techniques favored by Mihail Pascaly, replacing emphatic declamation with a more natural and studied perspective on acting. =Inspector general= In 1880, he printed Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea—a play centered on an uncultured \\"Red\\" pensioner and his naive wife, who overhear a street brawl and believe that a revolution is imminent. It was also then that his first memoirs from the world of theater were published, which coincided with the release of Ion Creangă's own book of memoirs, the well- known volume Amintiri din copilărie. Accompanied by Maiorescu, Caragiale left for Austria-Hungary. In Vienna, the two of them attended a staging of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, hosted by the Burgtheater.Vianu, Vol. II, p.180 He was practically unemployed after returning, and, in 1881, gave up his position at Timpul. Nevertheless, that autumn, V. A. Urechia, Minister of Education in the Ion Brătianu National Liberal cabinet, assigned him the office of inspector general for the Moldavian counties of Suceava and Neamţ. Profiting from the proximity between his new residence and Iaşi, Ion Luca Caragiale became a regular participant in Junimea's activities, becoming good friends with some of its most important representatives (Iacob Negruzzi, Vasile Pogor, and Petru Th. Missir).Cioculescu, p.5-6; Vianu, Vol. II, p.82, 117, 180 With Negruzzi, he dramatized Hatmanul Baltag, a short story by Nicolae Gane.Vianu, Vol. II, p.115 He became close to Veronica Micle, a woman writer who was also Eminescu's mistress.Ciupală, p.25; Vianu, Vol. II, p.180; Perpessicius, p.277 For a while, Caragiale and Micle had a love affair, although she continued to see the poet.Cioculescu, p.313; Ciupală, p.25; Perpessicius, p.277, 290 This caused the friendship between Eminescu and Caragiale to sour.Cioculescu, p.313 The former was jealous of Cargiale's relations with Micle, while she resented the poet's affair with Mite Kremnitz. Ion Luca and Mateiu Caragiale before 1900 Just one year after, Caragiale was moved back to Wallachia, becoming inspector general in Argeș and Vâlcea. He was ultimately stripped of this position in 1884, and found himself on the verge of bankruptcy; he thus accepted the lowly position of clerk for the civil registry administration. It is probably during this period that his melodrama O soacră was written and published—Caragiale, who was aware of its faults, indicated that it was a work from his youth, and dated it to 1876.Cazimir (1967), p.149-150 His account is challenged by several details in the text.Cazimir (1967), p.150 In June 1883, while visiting Maiorescu's house, he received news that Eminescu had suffered the first in a series of dementia attacks (owing to a disease that was to kill him in 1889).Vianu, Vol. II, p.150-152 Caragiale reportedly broke into tears.Cioculescu, p.280; Perpessicius, p.148; Vianu, Vol. II, p.150 This succession of events also saw him becoming involved in conflicts among Junimea members: like Pogor, Caragiale objected to the style of Vasile Alecsandri, an aged Junimist poet, and was shocked to find out that he was ridiculing the much younger Eminescu.Cioculescu, p.278-279, 280 He thus decided to criticize Alecsandri in public, during a March 1884 meeting of the society—Maiorescu recorded in his private notes that \\"[...] Caragiale [was] aggressive and rude toward Alecsandri.\\"Cioculescu, p.280 Caragiale's wealthy relative, Catinca Momulo Cardini (commonly known Catinca Momuloaia), who was the widow of a famous restaurateur and the cousin of his mother Ecaterina, died in 1885, and the writer had the prospect of inheriting a large fortune.Cioculescu, p.308, 362; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188 He nonetheless became involved in a trial with Momuloaia's other relatives, which prolonged itself until the early 20th century.Vianu, Vol. II, p.188 =First major successes= Months after this, his new comedy, O scrisoare pierdută, was first shown to the public. A fresco of conflicting political machines, provincial corruption, petty ambitions, and incoherent demagogy, it was an instant hit with the public.Ornea, p.227-228; Vianu, Vol. II, p.180 Arguably the high point of Caragiale's career, it became one of the best-known works of its kind in Romanian literature. Maiorescu was pleased by its success, and believed that it was a sign of maturity in Romanian society, which, as he put it, was \\"starting to laugh\\" at the National Liberal rhetoric.Ornea, p.228 Ion Luca Caragiale was romantically involved with an unmarried young woman, Maria Constantinescu, who worked for the Bucharest Town Hall—in 1885, she gave birth to Mateiu, whom Caragiale recognized as his son.Cioculescu, p.359, 366, 375 First printed version of D-ale carnavalului, as published in Convorbiri Literare (May 1885) During the same year, Caragiale's D-ale carnavalului, a lighter satire of suburban morals and amorous misadventures, was received with booing and heckling by members of the public—critics deemed it \\"immoral\\", due to its frank depiction of adultery gone unpunished.Cazimir (1967), p.27-28; Ornea, p.24; Vianu, Vol.I, p.335-336, 401, 409; Vol. II, p.61, 180 The controversy saw Maiorescu taking his friend's side and publishing an essay highly critical of National Liberal cultural tenets (titled Comediile domnului Caragiale, it was to be reprinted in 1889, as a preface to Caragiale's collected plays).Cazimir (1967), p.28-29; Ornea, p.9, 20, 24; Vianu, Vol.I, p.334, 335–336, 401; Vol. II, p.61-62, 180 In it, the critic, who was influenced by the ideas of Arthur Schopenhauer, argued that Caragiale had not failed in uplifting the human spirit, precisely because he had risen above both didacticism and egotism (see Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics).Cazimir (1967), p.28-29; Ornea, p.20, 24, 39; Vianu, Vol.I, p.332, 409; Vol. II, p.61-62, 64, 69 In reference to accusations that the play was unpatriotic, Maiorescu answered: > \\"[...] the present-day poems with a political intent, the odes on solemn > days, the theatrical compositions for dynastic glorifications are a > simulacrum of art, and not the real art. Even patriotism, the most important > sense for the citizen of a state in his actions as a citizen, has no place > in art as an ad-hoc form of patriotism [...]. Is there a single lyric of > French patriotism in Corneille? Is there any national spouting in Racine? Is > there one in Molière? Is there one in Shakespeare? Is there one in > Goethe?\\"Ornea, p.31-32 The article played an essential part in reconciling the dramatist to the general public, but also led to a polemic between Maiorescu and the philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (a Marxist who claimed that Maiorescu was contradicting himself).Ornea, p.319-320; Vianu, Vol.I, p.334, 335–336, 401, 409–410 Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Asupra esteticii metafizice şi ştiinţifice (wikisource) Dobrogeanu-Gherea argued in favor of Caragiale's work, but considered D-ale carnavalului to be his weakest play.Cazimir (1967), p.29-33 =Theater leadership and marriage= Despite his earlier conflicts with the National Liberals, Caragiale, who still faced problems in making a living, agreed to contribute pieces for the party press, and thus briefly associated with Voinţa Naţională (a journal issued by historian and politician Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol).Cioculescu, p.21; Vianu, Vol. II, p.180-181 Under the pen name Luca, he contributed two theater chronicles. In parallel, he taught classes at the privately run Sfântul Gheorghe High School in Bucharest.Vianu, Vol. II, p.181 This episode of his career ended in 1888, when Maiorescu ascended to the office of Minister of Education in the Teodor Rosetti cabinet (formed by a group of Junimist Conservatives). Caragiale requested to be appointed Head of Theaters, which also implied leadership of the National Theater. Although Maiorescu was initially opposed, Caragiale eventually received the post.Cioculescu, p.136; Vianu, Vol. II, p.181 The ultimate decision was attributed to Romania's Queen Elisabeth having asked Maiorescu to reconsider,Cioculescu, p.136 or, alternatively, to the support offered by the influential Junimist Petre P. Carp. Alexandrina Burelly The appointment caused some controversy at the time: Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike all his predecessors (the incumbent C. I. Stăncescu included), was both a professional in the field and a person of modest origins. As the National Liberals intensified their campaign against him, the dramatist drafted an open letter for the Bucharest press, outlining his intentions and explaining the circumstances of his appointment.Perpessicius, p.239; Vianu, Vol. II, p.181 In it, he attributed his own rise to the interest Junimea had taken in his work, while defending the literary society, which was, as he put it, \\"lost from the public eye at a time of political obscurity\\". Reviewing his own merits as a writer and manager, he elaborated and later put into practice a program for state-run theaters—according to Vianu, it signified \\"punctuality and rigor\\".Vianu, Vol. II, p.182 He nonetheless resigned at the end of the season, and resumed his literary activities. In January 1889, he married Alexandrina, the daughter of architect Gaetano Burelly. She was a member of the Bucharest elite, which served to improve Ion Luca Caragiale's social standing. They had two children of their own: Luca (known as Luky; born 1893) and Ecaterina (or Tuşchi; born 1894, later married Logadi).Cioculescu, p.367 Several years later, the Caragiales brought Mateiu into their home, and Ion Luca enrolled him at Anghel Demetrescu's Sfântul Gheorghe College. =Clash with the Academy= Early in 1890, at the same time as his volume of collected works, Caragiale published and staged his rural-themed tragedy Năpasta—both writings were presented for consideration to the Romanian Academy, in view of receiving its annual prize, the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award. Caragiale's conflict with the National Liberals reached its peak, as two of their representatives inside the forum, historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and future Premier Dimitrie Sturdza, reported unfavorably.Cioculescu, p.124, 129–132; Vianu, Vol. II, p.182 Additional criticism was voiced by the poet Gheorghe Sion, who also defended the a work by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (itself up for review).Cioculescu, p.130 When the Junimist Iacob Negruzzi defended his friend, Sturdza contrasted Caragiale's works with his own version of didacticism, claiming that it altogether lacked a moral and national quality.Cioculescu, p.124, 130–131; Vianu, Vol. II, p.182 Both Hasdeu and Sturdza hinted at the influence exercised over Caragiale by their adversary Maiorescu, and went on to compare the dramatist with foreign writers such as Mite Kremnitz and the Jewish Josef B. Brociner.Cioculescu, p.130-131 For the two liberal leaders, Kremnitz and Brociner, who had authored works critical of the Romanian establishment, were aiding to construct a negative image of the Romanian nation. Hasdeu insisted that Caragiale was himself creating problems for the country, while Sturza, showing himself more lenient in this respect, insisted that Caragiale's plays had failed to display a love for \\"the truth, the beautiful and the good\\".Cioculescu, p.131 He stressed: > \\"Mr. Caragiale should learn how to respect his nation, and not mock it.\\" Sturdza's discourse contributed to the Academy's negative vote (20 votes against and 3 in favor),Cioculescu, p.124, 131 and rose Caragiale's anger.Cioculescu, p.124; Vianu, Vol. II, p.182 In parallel, Dobrogeanu- Gherea's candidature for the prize was rejected with 16 votes against and 8 for. In 1897, writing for the Conservative paper Epoca, the writer lashed out at Sturdza and his partisans, claiming that they viewed all humorous talents as \\"unholy\\", \\"useless to the nation\\", and \\"downright perilous\\". Vianu noted that Caragiale's article directly aimed at Sturdza's reverence for Jacobinism, collectivism, and nationalism, which, in Caragiale's own words, > \\"manipulated the baggage of big words with which the phony liberal school > has been filling empty heads for fifty years on end\\". =Split with Junimea= The building in Buzău, across the street from the city railway station, where Caragiale leased a restaurant in 1895 During the controversy, Caragiale published two memoirs of Eminescu—the poet had died in June 1889.Perpessicius, p.190 One of them was titled În Nirvana (\\"Into Nirvana\\"), and notably expanded on the early years of their friendship and on one of Eminescu's earliest amorous disappointments.Perpessicius, p.190, 191, 194, 235, 290, 300 In an essay of the following year, he showed himself critical of a wave of Eminescu imitators, commenting: \\"A lot of reasonable people will walk the path and [...] of the people that know them only a few will raise their hats; whereas an insane person [...] will be followed by all the people. That is why the success of the [1890 Eminescu edition] has overcome all the editors' expectations\\".Perpessicius, p.138 He also reprinted his recollections from the world of theater, alongside pieces originally published in Claponul and various new satirical pieces. Although this attack owed much to Junimea's discourse, Caragiale had by then turned against Maiorescu, probably due to his perception that the society had failed to support his cause at the Academy.Vianu, Vol. II, p.182-183 In May 1892, he used a public conference at the Romanian Athenaeum as a venue to make known his claims against the former Minister of Education and his associates, which caused a definitive rift between the two public figures.Cioculescu, p.21; Mîndra, p.274; Ornea, p.200; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183 Caragiale also wrote Două note (\\"Two Notes\\"), an article accusing Maiorescu of having modified and censored some of Eminescu's poems, and of having exploited the poet for financial gain.Ornea, p.200; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183 Around that time, he ceased contributing to Convorbiri Literare. Late in 1892, Caragiale published two volumes of prose, including his new novellas Păcat, O făclie de Paşte and Om cu noroc.Vianu, Vol. II, p.183 The following year, he began frequenting socialist circles as an outsider to the cause, and soon became good friends with the Imperial Russian-born Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu- Gherea.Cioculescu, p.22; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183, 184 Financial constraints forced Caragiale to become an entrepreneur, and, in November of that year, opened a beer garden near Gabroveni Inn, in Bucharest's Lipscani area.Mîndra, p.274; Vianu, Vol. II, p.184 He probably moved on soon after, and purchased a pub on a neighboring street. In a letter he wrote at the time, the writer showed that he was planning to move to Transylvania, and considered starting a career as a teacher. In November 1893, as a gesture of goodwill towards his adversary, Alexandru Macedonski authored an article in Literatorul, in which he asked authorities if it was normal for a former Head of Theaters not to have a stable source of income—the intended recipient did not acknowledge this offer, and the Caragiale-Macedonski conflict escalated after he continued to attack the latter in the press.Cioculescu, p.135 One year later, Caragiale leased the restaurant catering to the train station in Buzău (just like Dobrogeanu-Gherea had done in Ploieşti).Cioculescu, p.23; Mîndra, p.274; Vianu, Vol. II, p.184 His successive businesses were all struggling, and Caragiale was often on the verge of bankruptcy. Although he invested time and work in the enterprise, and even affiliated with the International Association of Waiters for a short period, he eventually decided not to renew his contract upon the years' end. His period in Buzău was noted for its other results: in February 1895, the press reported that Caragiale had given a public lecture on \\"the causes of human stupidity\\". =Moftul Român and Vatra= George Coşbuc and Ion Luca Caragiale Together with the socialist activist Tony Bacalbaşa and the illustrator Constantin Jiquidi, he established the satirical magazine Moftul Român, which ceased print after a few months, before being revived in 1901 and becoming an important venue for social criticism.Mîndra, p.10-11, 274; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183 The new publication's spirit was indebted to Junimist discourse. Its title, translatable as \\"the Romanian trifle\\" or \\"the Romanian nonsense\\", alluded to the cynicism and self-importance of the emerging modern Romanian society. According to Vianu, this was a theme first debated by Junimea's Theodor Rosetti. Moft! thus mimicked the common answer to any important or merely exacerbated problem, and Caragiale also used it to illustrate what he saw as a common national feature.Vianu, Vol. II, p.183-184 In one of his early editorials for the magazine, he claimed that moft was to Romanians what spleen (melancholy) was to the English people, nihilism to the Russians, chauvinism to the Hungarians, and vendetta to the Italians. In parallel, Cargiale resumed his contacts with Transylvanian intellectuals: with George Coşbuc and Ioan Slavici, he founded the magazine Vatra (1 January 1894), before withdrawing from its leadership.Vianu, Vol. II, p.184 During his short stay, he printed an unsigned sketch story, Cum se înţeleg ţăranii (\\"How Peasants Communicate\\"), which mockingly recorded a lengthy and redundant dialog between two villagers,Cioculescu, p.40-41; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185 as well as a portrait of the deceased politician Mihail Kogălniceanu, and a fairy tale inspired by the writings of Anton Pann. He also translated a novella authored by his friend, Queen Elisabeth, under the title Răzbunare (\\"Revenge\\")—he is known to have been annoyed by the longueurs of the piece, and struck out large portions of it to improve the flow. During the same period, Caragiale had the initiative to publish short fragments he had translated from classical pieces, leaving readers to guess who their authors were—Vianu, citing the speculations made by other critics, presumed that these were writers admired by both Caragiale and his friend, the schoolteacher Anghel Demetrescu (Thomas Carlyle, Alexis de Tocqueville, Thomas Babington Macaulay, François Guizot and Augustin Thierry).Vianu, Vol. II, p.185 It was also then that he authored a piece on Prince Ferdinand, the heir apparent, who had fallen severely ill—it shows Caragiale to be a passionate defender of the Romanian monarchy, praying for Ferdinand's health. In 1898, he wrote a lengthy essay on the state of Romanian theater, in which he notably praised the actor Ion Brezeanu, who made his name through portrayals of Caragiale's characters, for, among others, his \\"sober and refined interpretation\\". Later that year, he published a new novella, În vreme de război, a fantasy set to the background of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878.Cioculescu, p.38 =Radical Party= In 1895, at the age of 43, Caragiale decided to join the Radical Party, led at the time by former Junimist George Panu; one year later, he began contributing to its mouthpiece, the newspaper Ziua.Cioculescu, p.23-24; Ornea, p.207-208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185 He was also briefly associated with the newspaper Sara, published in Iaşi.Cioculescu, p.10, 27 Despite this, Caragiale was again an associate of the National Liberals later the same year, when the Conservative cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu was replaced with one led by Dimitrie Sturdza.Cioculescu, p.23-24 Articles he contributed to Gazeta Poporului, a National Liberal newspaper, were centered on new attacks against Junimea and were signed with the pseudonyms i and Ion.Cioculescu, p.23 In mid-November 1895, Gazeta Poporului published an unsigned article which discussed the suicide of writer Alexandru Odobescu, investigating the mundane reasons behind it—the piece is generally attributed to Caragiale.Cioculescu, p.23-24; Ciupală, p.104-105 The writer placed the blame for Odobescu's death on his much younger lover, Hortensia Racoviţă, and hailed his wife, Saşa Odobescu, as a model of devoted womanhood.Ciupală, p.104-105 This episode of his life coincided with a period when relations between Romania and Austria-Hungary were extremely tense. Three years before, ethnic Romanian leaders in Austro- Hungarian-ruled Transylvania had signed the Transylvanian Memorandum, which inflamed passions among the Hungarians and led the authors to be indicted. Conservative Party politicians in Romania had succeeded in negotiating an amnesty, but their policies were overturned by the National Liberals, who appealed to nationalist and irredentist sentiment. Thus, Sturdza offered a measure of support to Eugen Brote, Tribuna editor and National Romanian Party activist. Brote, who fled Transylvania and planned to directly implicate the Romanian Kingdom into the conflict, attempted to replace the pro-Conservative leadership of the National Party with a selection of politicians favored by the National Liberals.Cioculescu, p.24 As Sturdza came to lead the cabinet, both he and Brote retracted their previous statements, but again provoked the National Party by alleging that its leaders were the actual radicals. In harsh terms, Caragiale exposed the understanding Sturdza had with Brote.Cioculescu, p.24-25; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185 Soon after, he authored a short story about a con artist who traveled to the imagined Transylvanian town of Opidul-nou, posing as the nationalist Romanian writer Alexandru Vlahuţă as a means to live off the local intelligentsia.Cioculescu, p.126; Vianu, Vol. II, p.187 In October 1897, he was outraged by news that Sturdza had given in to Austro- Hungarian demands, and that he had expelled Transylvanian nationalists from Romania: Caragiale held a speech in which he argued that Romanians living abroad were \\"indispensable\\" to the Romanian state.Cioculescu, p.125-126 =Epoca= Caragiale as a traveler, parting with Epoca (1890s caricature by Constantin Jiquidi) In 1895, the writer followed the Radical group into its unusual merger with the Conservative Party.Cioculescu, p.25-26; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185 This came at a time of unified opposition, when the Junimists themselves returned to their group of origin. Caragiale came to identify with the policies endorsed by a new group of Conservative leaders, Nicolae Filipescu and Alexandru Lahovari among them.Cioculescu, p.25-27 He was upset when Lahovari died not too long after, and authored his obituary.Cioculescu, p.26 Caragiale also became a collaborator on Filipescu's journal Epoca and editor of its literary supplement.Cioculescu, p.25-28, 271; Ornea, p.203-204; Mîndra, p.274; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185-186; Vol.III, p.281 A chronicle he contributed at the time discussed the philosophical writings of Dobrogeanu-Gherea: while sympathetic to his conclusions, Caragiale made a clear statement that he was not interested in the socialist doctrine or any other ideology (\\"Any idea, opinion or system is absolutely irrelevant to me, in the most absolute sense\\").Vianu, Vol. II, p.186 He also published an article criticizing Dimitrie Sturdza; its title, O lichea (roughly: \\"A Scoundrel\\"), was reluctantly accepted by Epoca, and only after Caragiale claimed that it reflected the original meaning of the word lichea (\\"stain\\"), explaining that it referred to Sturdza's unusual persistence in politics.Cioculescu, p.27 When answering to one of Epoca's inquiries, he showed that he had yet again come to reevaluate Junimea, and found it to be an essential institution in Romanian culture. Nevertheless, he was distancing himself from the purest Junimist tenets, and took a favorable view of Romantic writers whom the society had criticized or ridiculed—among these, he indicated his personal rival Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, whom he acknowledged to be among \\"the most remarkable figures of our literature\\", and Alexandru Odobescu. As editor of Epoca, he published works by Hasdeu alongside those of his other contemporaries and predecessors—Grigore Alexandrescu, Nicolae Filimon, Dinicu Golescu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, Cilibi Moise, Costache Negruzzi, and Anton Pann.Cazimir (1967), p.63, 84–85 He also took a more sympathetic but still distant view of Maiorescu. At the time, he befriended the young poet Cincinat Pavelescu, and helped to promote his works in the press. Cincinat Pavelescu, Amintiri literare (Ion Luca Caragiale) (wikisource) =Universul= Around that time, Caragiale began collaborating with the formerly Junimist figure Mihail Dragomirescu, who enlisted his anonymous contributions to the magazine Convorbiri Critice.Cioculescu, p.93, 293–311 Again pressed by financial problems, he returned to a bureaucratic post—this time with the administration of government monopolies, and appointed by the Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino in June 1899.Cioculescu, p.10; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.187 In 1901, the position was suppressed due to cutbacks in budget spending.Cioculescu, p.10; Vianu, Vol. II, p.187 This coincided with Sturdza's third mandate as Premier, and further aggravated the conflict between the two figures. At the same time, Caragiale was contributing to Luigi Cazzavillan's newly founded daily, Universul, where he was assigned the column \\"Notiţe critice\\" (\\"Critical Notes\\").Vianu, Vol. II, p.187 This material formed the bulk of his collected short prose volume, Momente şi schiţe, and notably comprised satirical pieces ridiculing the Romanian press' reaction to the activities of Boris Sarafov, a Macedonian-Bulgarian revolutionary who had attempted to set up a base in Romania. He continued to pursue a business career, and, in 1901, inaugurated his own company, Berăria cooperativă, which took over the Gambrinus pub in front of the National Theater. It soon became the site of a literary circle, which included, among others, Tony Bacalbaşa and Ion Brezeanu, the satirist Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu (known as Teleor), and the academic I. Suchianu. At the time, the Caragiales rented a house in Bucharest, near the present-day Bulevardul Magheru. In early 1901, as Ion Luca Caragiale entered his 25th year in literature, his friends offered him a banquet at Gambrinus, where speeches were given by Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea and the Conservative politician Take Ionescu,Cioculescu, p.28; Vianu, Vol. II, p.187-188 and where a special single-issue magazine, Caragiale, was circulated among the guests.Vianu, Vol. II, p.187-188 Hasdeu put aside his differences in opinion and sent in a congratulatory letter.Cioculescu, p.8; Vianu, Vol. II, p.187 In it, he deemed the dramatist \\"Romania's Molière\\".Cioculescu, p.8, 88–89, 141 Nevertheless, on 23 March 1902, the National Liberal majority in the Romanian Academy, headed by Sturdza, refused to consider Momente şi schiţe for the Năsturel Herăscu AwardCioculescu, p.124; Mîndra, p.274—despite a favorable report from Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio.Cioculescu, p.124 =Caion scandal= Caragiale in 1899 Soon after, Caragiale became involved in a major literary scandal. Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion, a journalist and student whom Tudor Vianu described as \\"a real pathological character\\", issued a claim that, in his Năpasta, the Romanian dramatist had plagiarized the work of a Hungarian-language author named István Kemény.Cioculescu, p.132-133; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 373 Caion expanded on this in articles published by Revista Literară, where he provided direct comparisons between the two texts. This was received with enthusiasm by Caragiale's old rival, Alexandru Macedonski, who publicized the controversy through one of his journals, Forţa Morală.Cioculescu, p.133-140; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 373–374, 387 Initially amazed by the similarity between the two texts, Caragiale carried out his own investigations, and, in the end, discovered that neither the writing nor Kemény had ever existed.Cioculescu, p.133; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 373 Employing Ştefănescu Delavrancea as his lawyer, he brought Caion to trial: a court sentenced Caion for calumny, but he was acquitted after an appeal in June 1902.Cioculescu, p.124, 133; Mîndra, p.16, 274; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188 Several commentators believe that this was owed to a strong National Liberal presence among members of the jury. During the retrial, Caion retracted all his previous claims, and instead argued that Năpasta plagiarized Leo Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness.Cioculescu, p.133 Macedonski supported the lost cause until the very end, and refused to distance himself from Caion even as the latter admitted to the court that he had invented the story.Cioculescu, p.133-140; Vianu, Vol. II, p.374 His magazine also accused Caragiale of having copied Victorien Sardou's Rabagas for his O scrisoare pierdută, as well as Henri Chivot and Alfred Duru's Le Carnaval d'un Merle Blanc in D-ale carnavalului.Cazimir (1967), p.100-101; Cioculescu, p.136-137 In one memorable incident of 14 February 1902, while he was hosting a literary festivity at the Bucharest Athenaeum, Macedonski was heckledCioculescu, p.137; Vianu, Vol. II, p.374 and responded by blowing a whistle.Vianu, Vol. II, p.374 Forţa Morală was shut down soon after this episode. In parallel, the National Theater offered Caragiale a degree of satisfaction, when it decided to showcase Rabagas, leaving the public to see that it was only remotely similar to his play.Cioculescu, p.137-138 In the wake of the scandal, Caragiale attempted to resume contacts with Maiorescu, and visited him several times. His former mentor was reticent, and finally rejected the offer for reconciliation – writing in his diary, he defined Caragiale's attempts as \\"apple-polishings\\" and paradări (\\"affectations\\"). =Move to Berlin= Having gained access to the Momulo Cardini inheritance, Caragiale became a rather wealthy man.Cioculescu, p.308; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188 According to Şerban Cioculescu, the writer soon lost most of the funds earned, transferring them to Mateiu Caragiale and his mother, but was again made rich by the death of his sister Lenci in autumn 1905—she left him the administrator of 160,000 lei.Cioculescu, p.308, 362 The latter event caused tensions between Mateiu and his father—Caragiale-son believed that he had been cheated out of the inheritance, and was angered by Ion Luca's decision to stop subsidizing him after he failed to complete his studies.Cioculescu, p.352, 357–358, 360–362, 363–364 He was by then enchanted with the idea of moving into a Western or Central European country, where he hoped to lead a more comfortable life and be closer to the centers of culture.Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 198–199 He was especially interested in gaining easier access to the major stages for classical music, as a means to satisfy his desire for quality in that field (he had by then come to adore the compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven).Cioculescu, p.222-231; Vianu, Vol. II, p.203 According to Tudor Vianu, Caragiale was also showing signs that he was about to enter a vaguely misanthropic phase of his life. In 1903–1904, the Caragiales traveled through various European countries, while the dramatist again considered establishing his residence in Transylvania.Cioculescu, p.308 They eventually moved to Berlin, the Imperial German capital, settling down in spring 1905.Cioculescu, p.308; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 198 The choice was considered unusual, since the writer knew only some basic German expressions. Iulia Blaga, \\"Casele lui I.L. Caragiale de la Berlin\\" , in România Liberă, 12 March 2007 This has led some commentators to speculate that the move was politically motivated. Mihail Dragomirescu believed that Caragiale was living at the expense of the German state. Cioculescu rejected this assessment, arguing that it relied on hearsay and pointing out that the chronological order provided by Dragomirescu was inaccurate.Cioculescu, p.308-309 In 1992, historian Georgeta Ene proposed that Caragiale was acting as a spy for Romania in Germany. The family lived in an apartment in Wilmersdorf and later at a villa in Schöneberg. Paraphrasing a Romanian proverb which speaks of \\"the black bread of exile\\", the dramatist jokingly referred to his relocation as \\"the white loaf\\" (franzela albă a surghiunului).Cioculescu, p.122, 209, 217; Perpessicius, p.442 He did not however isolate himself completely, becoming very close to the group of Romanian students attending the University of Berlin and to other young people: among them were poet and essayist Panait Cerna, sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, musician Florica Musicescu, and Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea's son-in- law, the literary critic Paul Zarifopol.Cioculescu, p.120, 122–123, 250, 262; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188 Caragiale was also close to the linguist Gustav Weigand.Cioculescu, p.250, 262 He frequently traveled to Leipzig, where he would meet with Zarifopol, as well as vacationing in Travemünde.Cioculescu, p.209-210, 231–236, 259; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189, 198 In 1906, together with Zarifopol, he visited Beethoven's house in Bonn.Cioculescu, p.281 He was close to the dramatist Ronetti Roman, and, in 1908, confessed that he was devastated by news of his death.Cioculescu, p.241-242 Caragiale was also visited by Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, who, as a Francophile, vehemently rejected the aesthetics of Berlin in their conversations. Delavrancea was accompanied by his daughter, Cella, a celebrated pianist. He also traveled back into Romania for intervals—when in Iaşi, he associated with the maverick Conservative Alexandru Bădărău and his journal Opinia.Cioculescu, p.12-16 He had closely followed Bădărău's career up to that point, and, in July 1906, authored an epigram on his ousting from the Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino Conservative cabinet—comparing Bădărău to Jonah and the Conservatives to a great fish that spat him out.Cioculescu, p.259 A poem he published during the same year ridicules King Carol I on the occasion of his fortieth year in power, while parodying the style of republican poet N. T. Orăşanu; without making direct references to the monarch, it features the lyrics Ca rol fu mare, mititelul (\\"Taking in view his role, he was grand, the little one\\"), with \\"ca\\" and \\"rol\\" spelling out his name (and thus allowing the poem to read \\"Carol was grand, the little one\\").Cioculescu, p.68 He continued to publish various works in several other newspapers and magazines, including various Tranylvanian papers and the Iaşi-based Viaţa Românească. His subsequent work comprised mostly correspondence with other literary figures, such as Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Mihail Dragomirescu, Alceu Urechia, and Zarifopol.Cioculescu, p.94-95, 117–119, 120, 122–123, 208–311; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189 He was also in touch with psychologist and philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru.Cioculescu, p.96-97; Vianu, Vol. II, p.192 At the time, Caragiale planned to start work on Titircă, Sotirescu et C-ie, meaning to combine the characters of his two most successful comedies (O noapte furtunoasă and O scrisoare pierdută) into one play—this was never accomplished.Cioculescu, p.80, 260, 278, 279, 297, 301–302, 364; Ornea, p.228 =1907= In 1907, Caragiale was shaken by the outbreak and violent repression of the Romanian Peasants' Revolt, and decided to write a lengthy essay, in which he condemned the agrarian policies of both National Liberal and Conservative governments from a patriotic perspective.Cioculescu, p.28-29, 119–124; Ornea, p.228; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189 According to Vianu, the resulting 1907, din primăvară până în toamnă (\\"1907, From Spring to Autumn\\") was, alongside earlier essays by Eminescu and Maiorescu, the most important works of social analysis to be written by that generation.Vianu, Vol. II, p.189 The essay, written in harsh tones, listed what Caragiale saw as the major social problems tolerated by Romanian administrations: he discussed the landowning class, successor to the boyars, having maintained as much possible from the legacy of serfdom; he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic oligarchy and its far-reaching political machine.Cioculescu, p.28-29, 121, 123, 268–271; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189-190 As several commentators noted, many of the topics brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by Junimea.Ornea, p.228; Vianu, Vol. II, p.190 To the social and political problems, the text offered a monarchist solution—Caragiale expected Carol I to carry out a coup d'état against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the Constitution of 1866, which left some room for privilege through the census suffrage, with a more democratic one.Cioculescu, p.301; Vianu, Vol. II, p.190-191 1907, din primăvară până în toamnă, first published in German under the pseudonym Ein rumänische Patriot (\\"A Romanian patriot\\"), was originally hosted by the Vienna-based newspaper Die Zeit.Cioculescu, p.28-29, 121, 127, 268; Mîndra, p.275; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189 The translation had been completed by his friend Mite Kremnitz.Cioculescu, p.28, 121, 268 In its original, the work was later printed under Caragiale's signature by the left- wing Romanian journal Adevărul.Cioculescu, p.28; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189 The author had agreed to make himself known after Die Zeit reached Romania and had caused the local press to wonder who had condemned the system in such harsh words.Cioculescu, p.123-124 The brochure attracted instantaneous attention in his native country, and its success was notable: it sold around 13,000 copies.Cioculescu, p.28, 260–261, 301 There were notable differences between the two versions, which were the result of Caragiale's answer to criticism and suggestions from Christian Rakovsky, a prominent internationalist socialist who had been expelled from Romania early in the year.Cioculescu, p.28, 46 Caragiale elaborated on some of the essay's themes in a series of fables he published soon after.Cioculescu, p.28, 47–48, 268 This chain of events prompted Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea to offer him a position in the Conservative Party, as a means to reform the system from within.Cioculescu, p.304; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191 Caragiale rejected the offer: by then, he had grown disillusioned with the traditional political groupings, and had decided to sever all his links with them.Cioculescu, p.27-28, 29–30; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191 Instead, in 1908, he joined the Conservative-Democratic Party, a rising force of the entrepreneurial middle class, led by Take Ionescu.Cioculescu, p.29-30, 271–273; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191 He briefly returned to Romania several times after 1908, campaigning in favor of the Ionescu and being himself proposed for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies (before the Conservative-Democrats decided another person was more suited for the position).Cioculescu, p.272-273; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191, 192 His involvement in politics engendered a collateral conflict with his son Mateiu, after the latter expressed a wish to become part of the administration (a project ridiculed by Caragiale-father).Cioculescu, p.365, 368 In December 1907, after Opinia became a mouthpiece of Ionescu's party, Caragiale received news that its headquarters had been vandalized by A. C. Cuza and his nationalist supporters (who were students at the University of Iaşi). Just days after, when Cuza's group offered to host a Caragiale festival, he refused to participate, citing his respect for the freedom of the press.Cioculescu, p.14-16 It was also during the period that he published his Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur, grouping short pieces about cultural figures such as Iorgu Caragiale, Pantazi Ghica, and Matei Millo. =Final years= Alexandru Davila and Ion Luca Caragiale Ion Luca Caragiale c. 1912 Beginning in 1909, Caragiale resumed his contributions to Universul.Vianu, Vol. II, p.191 The same year, his fantasy piece Kir Ianulea, which explored the history of Bucharest during the early 19th century and the late stages of the Phanariote period, was published by Viaţa Românească.Vianu, Vol. I, p.313; Vol. II, p.191, 205 The novella partly built on Belfagor arcidiavolo, by Renaissance author Niccolò Machiavelli,Călinescu, p.181-182; Cioculescu, p.203-207, 262; Vianu, Vol. I, p.313 and was occasionally classified as an example of historical fiction. Similar stories use themes from the One Thousand and One Nights (Abu-Hasan) and popular anecdotes (Pastramă trufanda).Călinescu, p.181 Another work of the time was Calul dracului, a rural-themed account of demonic temptation, which Vianu called \\"one of the most perfect short stories to have been written in Romanian language\\".Vianu, Vol.I, p.313-314; Vol. II, p.205 His last collection of writings, titled Schiţe nouă (\\"New Sketches\\") saw print in 1910.Mîndra, p.25 During that period, after giving endorsement to a project outlined by his fellow dramatist Alexandru Davila, he aided in the creation of a new privately run Bucharest theater, and recorded its inauguration in his reportage Începem (\\"We Begin\\"). By that time, Ion Luca Caragiale became remarkably close to a new generation of ethnic Romanian intellectuals in Austria-Hungary. In 1909, he recalled the union of the two Danubian Principalities under Alexander John Cuza, and predicted the union of Transylvania with Romania.Cioculescu, p.126-127; Vianu, Vol. II, p.192 He visited Budapest to meet with Transylvanian students at the local university, and was the subject of a PhD thesis authored by Horia Petra-Petrescu (which was also the first monograph on his work).Cioculescu, p.250; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191 He decided to support the poet and activist Octavian Goga, who, after questioning ethnic policies in Transleithania, had been jailed by Hungarian authorities—writing for Universul, Caragiale stressed that such persecutions carried the risk of escalating tensions in the region.Vianu, Vol. II, p.191-192 Later, he visited Goga in Szeged, where he was serving time in jail.Vianu, Vol. II, p.192; Vol.III, p.74, 75–77 Caragiale's grave in the Bellu cemetery (flanked by those of Mihai Ralea and Traian Săvulescu) Caragiale also contributed to the Arad- based journal Românul, becoming friends with other Romanian activists—Aurel Popovici, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Vasile Goldiş.Cioculescu, p.31; Vianu, Vol. II, p.192 His articles expressed support for the National Romanian Party, calling for its adversaries at Tribuna to abandon their dissident politics.Cioculescu, p.31 In August 1911, he was present in Blaj, where the cultural association ASTRA was celebrating its 50th year. Caragiale also witnessed one of the first aviation flights, that of the Romanian Transylvanian pioneer Aurel Vlaicu. In January 1912, as he turned 60, Caragiale declined taking part in the formal celebration organized by Emil Gârleanu's Romanian Writers' Society.Cioculescu, p.69; Mîndra, p.25; Vianu, Vol. II, p.192 Caragiale had previously rejected Constantin Rădulescu-Motru's offer to carry out a public subscription in his favor, arguing that he could not accept such financial gains.Cioculescu, p.267-268; Vianu, Vol. II, p.192 He died suddenly at his home in Berlin, very soon after returning from his trip.Mîndra, p.25; Vianu, Vol. II, p.192-193 The cause of death was indicated as myocardial infarction. His son Luca recounted that, on that very night, Caragiale-father was rereading William Shakespeare's Macbeth, which he found to be a moving narrative. Caragiale dead body was transported to Bucharest in a freight train, which lost its way on the tracks and arrived with a major delay. He was eventually buried in Bellu cemetery on 22 November 1912. His longtime rival Alexandru Macedonski was saddened by the news of his death, and, in a letter to Adevărul, argued that he preferred Caragiale's humor to that of the American Mark Twain, stressing that \\"[w]e attacked each other often because we loved each other a lot.\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.375 Style and cultural tenets According to Tudor Vianu, Caragiale's writings signify \\"the highest expression\\" of Romanian theater, mirroring and complimenting the contribution Mihai Eminescu had to Romanian-language poetry.Vianu, Vol. II, p.175 Vianu nonetheless pointed out the immense difference in style and approach between the Eminescu and Caragiale, noting that, to Eminescu's metaphysical interests and \\"Romantic genius\\", the dramatist opposed his \\"great classical and realist endowment, a social, voluble and epicurean nature\\". Critics and historians place Caragiale's style midway between the delayed Classicism of 19th century Romanian literature and Realism (with its fin de siècle development, Naturalism).Călinescu, p.179; Cioculescu, p.5, 10, 93, 96, 107–110; Cazimir (1967), p.45-46, 49, 58; Vianu, Vol.I, p.310; Vol. II, p.201-202, 203–204 The writer, who abided by the classical unities,Cazimir (1967), p.45-46 rejected Romantic tenets, and, as early as the 1870s, opposed the lyricism present in the dramas of Victor Hugo and Friedrich Schiller.Cioculescu, p.96, 109–110 Neoclassicism in his works is further enhanced in his drama and comedies by his adherence to Eugène Scribe's principles (see Well-made play).Vianu, Vol. I, p.310 Paul Zarifopol argued that, for most of his life, Caragiale, the opponent of didacticism, advocated Maiorescu's principles of art for art's sake. He often sketched out alternative endings to his stories, and selected the ones he felt came most natural. Nevertheless, Zarifopol also noted that, late in his life, the writer contemplated adding a didactic message to one of his writings, which was to remain unfinished. His role in the Romanian context was likened to those of Honoré de Balzac in France, Charles Dickens in the United Kingdom, and Nikolai Gogol in the Russian Empire.Cioculescu, p.107-108; Vianu, Vol.I, p.310 Literary critic Pompiliu Constantinescu credited Caragiale's sense of irony with having corrected the tendencies of his day, and, through this, with helping create an urban literature.Mîndra, p.269 Caragiale's interest in Realism was however denied by some of his Junimist advocates, who attempted to link his entire work with Maiorescu's guidelines: on the basis of Schopenhauerian aesthetics, critic Mihail Dragomirescu postulated that his humor was pure, and did not draw on any special circumstance or context.Cazimir (1967), p.36-38; Cioculescu, p.16; Vianu, Vol. II, p.65 Through many of his traits, Caragiale was connected to a Balkan environment of virtually permanent human contact, with its humor condensed in anecdotes, mimicry, and witty comebacks.Călinescu, p.181; Vianu, Vol. I, p.307-308; Vol. II, p.195 Zarifopol quoted him saying that he admired the traditional forms of entertainment, and that he admired the soitarìi (\\"buffoons\\").Cazimir (1967), p.46-48 Largely reflecting his primordial study of dramaturgy, Caragiale's literature is indebted to dialog, as well as, in rarer cases, to internal monologue and free indirect speech (the favorite technique of Naturalists).Vianu, Vol.I, p.311; Vol. II, p.204 Language takes the central role in his work, often compensating for the lack of detail.Mîndra, p.270; Vianu, Vol.I, p.311; Vol. II, p.203-204 To this was added his tendency to reduce texts to their essence—he shortened down not only his own text, but also his occasional translations of stories by Queen Elisabeth and even Miguel de Cervantes or Edgar Allan Poe. At times, he added a lyrical, meditative or autobiographical, perspective to his works: this trait was especially obvious in his later fantasy works (Kir Ianulea and Calul dracului among them), all marked by Neoromantic inspiration.Vianu, Vol. II, p.205 Zarifopol claimed that, although Caragiale often rejected the tendency of other writers to capitalize on picturesque images, he often used them in his own writings. Caragiale arguably won as much acclaim for his rigorous approach to playwriting as for his accomplished style. With Alexandru Vlahuţă, George Coşbuc and others, he belonged to the first generation of Romanian authors to take a noted interest in imposing professionalism.Vianu, Vol. III, p.14 He was specific about this requirement—on one occasion, he used sarcasm to overturn a common misconception, saying: \\"Literature is an art that needs not be learned; whoever knows how to turn letters into syllables and the latter into words has had sufficient preparation to engage in literature.\\" Commenting on this, Vianu stressed: \\"[...] even under the appearance of ease, [Caragiale] lets us catch sight of the severe law of his art\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.206 (adding elsewhere that \\"[Caragiale] was a scrupulous and tormented artist\\").Vianu, Vol. I, p.314 Caragiale compared writers who could not dissimulate their intent and generate a good story with \\"a cross-eyed who tells you which way to go: one doesn't known if he is to go down the road he points to, or down the road he is looking at\\". Speaking in the late 1890s, he also likened writing for the stage with architecture: > \\"In truth, just as much as the architect's plan is not yet the final > accomplishment of his intent—that is to say, the monument—but only its > conventional recording [...], so too is the dramaturg's writing not yet the > accomplishment of his intent—that is to say, the comedy—but the conventional > recording, to which will be added the personal elements, in order to depict > a development of human circumstances and deeds. In short: just as an > architect's plan bears little resemblance to a painting, so does drama bear > little resemblance to a poem.\\" Political and social vision =Liberalism and republicanism= Anti- dynasty cartoon, published in Ghimpele in 1872, and illustrating the differences of opinion inside the liberal camp. Left panel: Alexander John Cuza betrayed by Ion Brătianu; right panel: Carol I, supported by Otto von Bismarck and Brătianu, feeding off of German influence and economic privilege His interest in first-hand investigation of the human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and universalist theories.Cioculescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol. II, p.193-194, 196 Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like Junimea, he was amused by the cultural legacy of 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed that there was a clear difference between the first generation of liberal activists—Ion Câmpineanu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Nicolae Bălcescu—and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption.Ornea, p.202-204, 228 He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu.Ornea, p.203 At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the Conservatives.Ornea, p.202-203 He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.Vianu, Vol. I, p.167, 308–309 His almost lifelong critique of the liberal current, marked by his conflicts with Dimitrie Sturdza and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, was partly inspired by Junimea's guidelines—in line with the Junimists, Caragiale perceived liberals as agents of Populism, popular Romanticism, and Idealism, as tenets prevalent in the literature of his day.Cioculescu, p.9 For Caragiale, the resulting liberal-inspired literary works were spanac (\\"spinach\\").Cioculescu, p.9, 264 The writer thus identified late 19th-century Romanian liberalism \\"empty talk\\", and his attacks on demagogy partly mirrored Maiorescu's views about the National Liberals' \\"inebriation with words\\".Ornea, p.205, 211, 291 Caragiale centered some of his first attacks on the \\"Reds\\" and their leader C. A. Rosetti, in whose republicanism and inflammatory rhetoric he saw the main threat to Romanian society.Cioculescu, p.179-180; Ornea, p.209-217 The writer believed that, ever since having ousted Alexander John Cuza from his throne, both Rosetti and Ion Brătianu were using their republican basis as an asset, inciting to rebellion only when their demands were not met.Ornea, p.211-213 He frequently ridiculed the cult with which Rosetti surrounded figures of international republicanism, such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Léon Gambetta, and indicated that the National Liberal public had very vague and impractical notions of what a republican state actually implied.Ornea, p.210-217 The republican agitation is no longer emphasized in Caragiale's later works, as republicanism slowly faded out of the mainstream liberal discourse.Ornea, p.212 Noting this, several critics believe that, in his O scrisoare pierdută, which depicts the battle between two unnamed political camps, the dramatist alluded to the conflict between Brătianu's moderates and Rosetti's extremists (as indicated by the fact that all the main characters attend the same rallies).Ornea, p.217-218 This view was disputed by Zarifopol, who argued that the more pragmatic grouping stands for the Conservatives, and the demagogic one for the National Liberals as a whole.Ornea, p.217 =Nationalism= Ion Luca Caragiale was a vocal critic of antisemitism, which was mostly represented by the National Liberals and A. C. Cuza's emerging movement. At a time when the Jewish community was denied emancipation, he advocated its full integration into Romanian society, calling for civil rights to be extended to all residents of Romania. Around 1907, he tried his hand at writing a legislative proposal, according to which the Romanian state was to extend citizenship all resident stateless persons who did not enjoy foreign protection—in its manuscript form, this document was kept by his friend Dimitrie Gusti.Cioculescu, p.30-31 According to Garabet Ibrăileanu, his rejection of antisemitic views was owed either to his failure to relate with the middle class and its anti-Jewish stances, or to his \\"powerful intelligence\\", which contrasted with the \\"instinctual, almost zoological nature\\" of the antisemitic discourse. His criticism of both the nationalist discourse and liberal-inspired education generated subjects for several of his shorter satirical writings. Caragiale thus authored a mock-pamphlet advertising the program of a new cultural society, Românii Verzi (the \\"Green Romanians\\"), who took its racialist proposals to the point of arguing that \\"[...] a nation must always fear other nations\\".Ornea, p.224 Like Junimea, he was entirely opposed to the group of August Treboniu Laurian and other Transylvanian intellectuals, who attempted to reform the Romanian language by introducing new forms of speech and writing that aimed to return it closer to its Latin roots. In his stories, Caragiale created the teacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, a caricature of both the liberal educators and the Transylvanian \\"Latinists\\".Ornea, p.226 While in Berlin, the writer also persiflaged some of Vasile Alecsandri's liberal and patriotic writings—he completed Alecsandri's nationalist poem Tricolorul with sarcastic verses that were meant to enhance its xenophobic feel (showing the Romanians ready to do battle against all their perceived enemies in Eastern Europe).Cioculescu, p.68, 216, 252–253 Nevertheless, various authors believe that a young Caragiale did indeed support nationalist liberal policies, and presume that he was behind a series of anti-Jewish columns, published by Voinţa Naţională during the early 1880s. This was for long disputed: rabbi and literary historian Moses Gaster attributed the pieces to Nicolae Xenopol, while researcher Şerban Cioculescu, who originally doubted them, eventually agreed that they formed an integral part of Caragiale's work. =Conservatism and traditionalism= Caragiale (left) and Alexandru Vlahuţă In some of his early articles, and again as he distanced himself from Junimea, the writer showed himself to be a vocal critic of the Conservative doctrine and its Junimist representatives. This is especially evident in his 1907 essay and in some of his stories.Ornea, p.228-229 Caragiale claimed that both Titu Maiorescu and Petre P. Carp were \\"boyars\\" who prioritized the interest of their social class (which was by then nonetheless defunct, as traditional privilege had been formally abolished a generation earlier).Cioculescu, p.22-23, 29, 121, 304 Cioculescu attributed this to an \\"inferiority complex\\" Caragiale felt in respect to his former patrons.Cioculescu, p.22 Despite his brief association with the mainstream Conservatives, Caragiale was probably never their partisan, and only hoped that the party could open the way for the reforms advertised by George Panu and Alexandru Lahovari.Cioculescu, p.269, 271; Ornea, p.206-209 When disappointed with their failure to promote change, he moved on to support Take Ionescu and his dissident grouping.Cioculescu, p.271-273; Ornea, p.208 Uniquely among students of Caragiale's work, George Călinescu argued that the writer's main interest was not in criticizing the liberals, but actually in an overall rejection of the most embedded Junimist tenets, which, in Călinescu's view, had engendered \\"a lack of faith in the country's own powers\\".Cazimir (1967), p.54 Paul Zarifopol believed that several of his Momente şi schiţe characters, including the effeminate high life chronicler Edgar Bostandaki, are caricatures of the Conservatives. Caragiale contrasted the other major writers of his generation, including his friends Mihai Eminescu, Ioan Slavici, Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, and Sămănătorul journal founder Alexandru Vlahuţă, all of whom were advocating a return to the rural sphere and peasant traditionalism.Vianu, Vol.I, p.312; Vol. II, p.184, 199 In Moftul Român, he parodied the archaisms favored by Ştefănescu Delavrancea;Cioculescu, p.41-43; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185 during his final years, he also questioned the aesthetic value of Ştefănescu Delavrancea's medieval-themed play Apus de soare.Cioculescu, p.253 Prominent nationalists and traditionalists tended to be reserved in their assessment of Caragiale's literary contributions—they include his friend Eminescu and historian Nicolae Iorga.Cioculescu, p.28, 305 Nonetheless, Ion Luca Caragiale was, according to Zarifopol, a passionate advocate of tradition in front of innovation, and \\"a defender of the well- established truths\\". Tudor Vianu also evidenced that Caragiale treasured his Orthodox identity, frequently appealing to God and the saints in both his private life and his writings.Vianu, Vol. II, p.197 According to Ioan Slavici, Caragiale defined himself as \\"a right-believing Christian\\", and disagreed with Eminescu on the nature of religion (at a time when the poet was a passionate student of Buddhism). Cioculescu called this trait \\"primitive religiosity\\".Cioculescu, p.7 The writer is also known to have convinced that luck and destiny manifested themselves in life,Călinescu, p.180; Cioculescu, p.7; Vianu, Vol. II, p.204 and his Cănuţă om sucit, a short story about a proverbially unlucky fellow, is thought to have referred to its author.Călinescu, p.180; Vianu, Vol. II, p.204 His superstitions were accompanied by a series of phobias, particularly pyrophobia and nosophobia. =Caragiale and the modernists= Ion Luca Caragiale was mostly critical of literary experiments and the newer stages of Modernism. On this basis, he persistently ridiculed Alexandru Macedonski's style, especially after the latter adopted Symbolism. Much of his own poetry, especially pieces published in Moftul Român after 1901, parodied the Romanian Symbolist clubs and the Parnassianism of Macedonski's LiteratorulCioculescu, p.63-64, 67, 134 (among the best-known of these targets was poet Cincinat Pavelescu, who was coeditor at Literatorul).Cioculescu, p.134 As editor of Epoca's literary supplement, Caragiale refused to publish a descriptive poem by the young Gala Galaction, claiming that it was not poetry (when Nicolae Filipescu asked him to reconsider, he threatened to quit).Vianu, Vol. III, p.281 Late in his life, he reserved explicit criticism for the new generation of Symbolists, whose work, he argued, belonged to \\"the church\\" of Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck.Cioculescu, p.67 Zarifopol also noted that, for as long as he lived, the writer derided the innovative works of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, but pointed out that Caragiale had never actually read or seen their plays. Nevertheless, Caragiale was not entirely opposed to newer trends in poetry and art. Literary critic Matei Călinescu believes that he genuinely admired În oraşul cu trei sute de biserici (\\"In the City with Three Hundred Churches\\"), a free verse poem by the Symbolist Ion Minulescu.Matei Călinescu, \\"Prefaţă\\", in Ion Minulescu, Romanţe pentru mai târziu şi alte poezii, Editura pentru literatură, Bucharest, 1967, p.XIV. This work is believed to have inspired a 1908 parody by Caragiale, in which the writer proclaimed his support for Take Ionescu.Cioculescu, p.66 According to poet and essayist Tudor Arghezi, Caragiale also admired the works of Ştefan Luchian, a Postimpressionist whose paintings were often exhibited in Bucharest galleries.Tudor Arghezi, Scrieri. Proze, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1985, p.621. =Caragiale and the Left= Moving toward the Left during the final decades of his life, the writer maintained connection with the socialists, but was nonetheless ambivalent to their goals. As Cioculescu noted, he welcomed the Bucharest celebration of May Day in one of his Moftul Român pieces, and probably agreed to lecture for the Workers' Club in the capital. Some of his writings were hosted by the socialist journal România Muncitoare.Mîndra, p.11 According to Garabet Ibrăileanu, himself a socialist at the time, \\"sometime after 1890, Caragiale briefly flirted with socialism.\\" However, over the same period, Caragiale ridiculed several socialist militants, referring to one of their leaders with the derisive nickname Edgard Spanachidi (itself a derivative of \\"spinach\\").Cioculescu, p.22, 64 Instead, his loose association with George Panu signified a return to radicalism, and saw him campaigning in favor of universal suffrage and a complete land reformCioculescu, p.23, 46–47; Ornea, p.208-209—this clashed with the views he had expressed earlier in life, and Caragiale was careful not to let it seem that he had returned to the \\"Red\\" liberalism of his youth.Ornea, p.209 In one of his articles, Ion Luca Caragiale commented with irony on the Marxist views of his friend Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea: he compared the latter's way of dining on a leg of veal, laboriously carving it into sections, to his philosophical approach. Caragiale thus noted that philosophical skepticism was equivalent to stripping the bone of its flesh piece by piece, and then throwing it to the dogs—without having been able to fully document the leg of veal or its substance.Vianu, Vol. II, p.194 Nevertheless, as Tudor Vianu indicated, although Caragiale preferred observation and spontaneity to speculation, he was not averse to pure philosophical analysis, and frequently quoted the classics in defense of his aesthetic guidelines.Vianu, Vol. II, p.194-195 Late in his life, Caragiale also sparked debates after deriding the emerging Poporanism, a school of thought which took its inspiration from socialism, agrarianism and traditionalism.Cioculescu, p.43, 67 He is also known to have been amused by the German election of 1907 and the resulting defeat registered by the Social Democratic Party.Cioculescu, p.271 Caragiale maintained a friendship with Dobrogeanu-Gherea for much of his life. He was especially interested in news of Dobrogeanu-Gherea having become involved in the 1905 Russian battleship Potemkin scandal, after the aging socialist decided to offer his help to the refugee sailors as they arrived in Constanţa.Cioculescu, p.243-246 During his time in Berlin, he repeatedly tried to convince the Dobrogeanu-Ghereas to leave their home in Romania and join him abroad.Cioculescu, p.240 Nonetheless, he criticized the philosopher when the latter refused to be decorated by King Carol I (1909).Cioculescu, p.245-246 Around 1907, the dramatist was also interested in the activities of Christian Rakovsky, who was trying to make his way back into Romania, and closely followed news of street clashes between his supporters and the authorities.Cioculescu, p.246-248 Settings Early 20th century panorama of Sinaia The writer had an unprecedented familiarity with the social environments, traits, opinions, manners of speech, means of expression and lifestyle choices of his day—from the rural atmosphere of his early childhood, going through his vast experience as a journalist, to the high spheres of politics (National Liberal as well as Conservative, Junimist as well as socialist).Cioculescu, p.6, 7–8; Vianu, Vol. II, p.193 An incessant traveler, Caragiale carefully investigated everyday life in most areas of the Romanian Old Kingdom and Transylvania.Vianu, Vol. II, p.193 He was an unusually sociable man:Cioculescu, p.118 in one of his letters from Berlin, he asked Alceu Urechia to send his regards to over 40 of his acquaintances in Sinaia (from Austro-Hungarian diplomats to street vendors or beggars).Cioculescu, p.118-119 Several of his major works have a rural setting—they include Năpasta, În vreme de război, La hanul lui Mânjoală, Calul dracului, Păcat, and O făclie de Paşte, as well as fragments of the pseudo- fairy tales he authored late in life.Vianu, Vol.I, p.312, 313–314; Vol. II, p.198, 205 Nevertheless, Caragiale is foremost known and acclaimed for his urban themes, which form the background to the vast majority of his most accomplished writings.Ornea, p.64, 221–223, 229; Vianu, Vol.I, p.312-313; Vol. II, p.198-200 The author depicted the city in all stages of its development and in all its atmospheres—from nightlife to Căldură mare's midday torpor, from noisy slums and the Târgul Moşilor fair in Obor to the English-inspired tea parties of the urban elite.Ornea, p.221-223; Vianu, Vol. II, p.199-200 This large fresco drew comparisons with his generation colleague Ion Creangă, who was argued to have done the same for the countryside.Ornea, p.229 Caragiale was especially proud of the opening paragraph in his Ultima emisiune... story, part of Momente şi schiţe, which, he believed, the \\"corner of a slum\\" was suggested to perfection.Cioculescu, p.71 Tudor Vianu also noted that, among cities and towns, Caragiale preferred Bucharest and those provincial centers most exposed to Central European influences (specifically, the summer retreats in the Prahova Valley and other Wallachian stations on the way to Transylvania).Vianu, Vol. II, p.199 The enclosed world of the Romanian Railways also appealed to the writer, and an impressive number of his sketches relate to it in various ways. Collective characters Târgul Moşilor, the fair in Obor (late 19th-century painting by Sava Henția) Confessing at some point that \\"the world was my school\\", Caragiale dissimulated his background and critical eye as a means to blend into each environment he encountered, and even adopted the manners and speech patterns he later recorded in his literary work.Cioculescu, p.6-7; Vianu, Vol. II, p.195 He thus encouraged familiarity, allowing people to reveal their histories, motivations, and culture. Vianu recounted: \\"The man was a consummate actor and a pince-sans-rire, an ironist [...] to the point where his partners of dialog were never sure if they were spoken to «seriously» [...].\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.196 In one of his pieces from 1899, he welcomed the famous actors Eleonora Duse and Jean Mounet-Sully to Bucharest, imitating the exaggerated style of other theater chroniclers—the article ended with Caragiale confessing that he had not actually seen the two perform. In one other instance, as a means to comment on plagiarism, the author also parodied his own O făclie de Paşte—which he turned into the sketch, Noaptea Învierii. In 1907, din primăvară până în toamnă, his late and disillusioned work, Caragiale lashed out at the traditional class of political clients, with an indictment which, Tudor Vianu believed, also served to identify the main focus of his other writings: > \\"plebs incapable of work and lacking employment, impoverished suburban small > traders and street vendors, petty dangerous agitators of the villages and of > the areas adjacent to towns, bullying election agents; and then the hybrid > product of all levels of schooling, semi-cultured intellectuals, lawyers and > lawyerlings, professors, teachers and teacherlings, semi-illiterate and > unfrocked priests, illiterate schoolteachers—all of them beer garden > theorists; next come the great functionaries and the little clerks, most of > them removable from office.\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.190 Direct criticism was nonetheless rare in Caragiale's fiction: Vianu believed to have found traces of it in O scrisoare pierdută (\\"the most cruel [of his satires]\\") and in Grand Hotel \\"Victoria română\\" (\\"the most bitter\\").Vianu, Vol. II, p.201 On several occasions, Caragiale showed or even defined himself as a sentimental, and his modesty was acknowledged by several of his friends.Vianu, Vol.I, p.314; Vol. II, p.197-198; Vol.III, p.74, 75–76 Vianu noted that, alongside his Christian ethos, this contributed to his distant, calm and often sympathetic overall take on society.Vianu, Vol.I, p.314; Vol. II, p.200-201 In his words: > \\"A wave of charm, of reconciliation with life passes above all [his > characters], one which, if it only assumes light and superficial shapes, > experienced by naive people with harmless manias, is a sign that the > collective existence is taking place in shelter from the great > trials.\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.200 In contrast with this, Poporanist critic Garabet Ibrăileanu argued that Caragiale actually hated the people who inspired his works, and claimed that the writer had made this clear during one of their conversations.Cazimir (1967), p.44 His account was considered doubtful by researcher Ştefan Cazimir, who believed that Ibrăileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale's work. According to Vianu, there is a manifest difference between Ion Luca Caragiale's comedies and his Momente şi schiţe: the former are, in his view, driven by situations and circumstances, whereas the latter sees Caragiale developing his original perspective to its fullest.Vianu, Vol.I, p.309-310; Vol. II, p.200-201 This, he argues, was determined by important social changes—a move from a traditional world—awkwardly attempting to digest Westernization, modernization, and Francized culture—, to a more stable and prosperous environment.Vianu, Vol.I, p.309-310; Vol. II, p.200 A similar division was applied by Ibrăileanu.Ornea, p.221 Types =Theoretical aspects= The form of Realism favored by Caragiale placed types of characters at the center of literary creativity, owing to the influence of Classicism. Several critics have credited Momente şi schiţe, as well as all his dramas, with providing some of the first truly believable portrayals in local literature.Mîndra, p.269-270 Vianu stressed that Classicist borrowings in Caragiale's writings were limited, indicating that Caragiale parted with the notion of \\"generic types\\" to look for the \\"social\\" ones. In parallel, literary critic George Călinescu argued that \\"[t]he typological structure is present in Caragiale's work as a supporting structure, without being essential.\\"Călinescu, p.183 In Vianu's assessment, the universal human nature was important to Caragiale, but not made instantly obvious (as opposed to the immediate importance his characters were meant to have in the eyes of his public).Vianu, Vol. II, p.201-202 Vianu illustrated this concept after investigating the manner in which Caragiale completed his O scrisoare pierdută: the author was for long undecided about which character was to win the electoral battle on which the play centers, but opted for Agamiţă Dandanache, the senile radical, because his victory was to give the play more depth.Vianu, Vol. II, p.202 Caragiale was thus quoted saying that Dandanache was \\"more stupid\\" than the clueless politician Tache Farfuridi, and \\"more of a scoundrel\\" than the unprincipled and cunning journalist Nae Caţavencu.Cazimir (1967), p.143; Ornea, p.221; Vianu, Vol. II, p.202 In Vianu's view, Momente şi schiţe was more vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and states of mind, whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict feelings and occasionally provided additional details such as physiology or cenesthesia. Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, was generally not interested in offering the reader access to his characters' psychological background—aside from his Năpasta and Păcat, and O făclie de Paşte, he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, as a means to parody its use.Vianu, Vol. I, p.312 A similar view was expressed by Vianu's predecessor, Silvian Iosifescu, who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest,Mîndra, p.271 while George Călinescu himself believed that the characters' motivations in O făclie de Paşte are actually physiological and ethnological.Călinescu, p.179 Maiorescu was especially fond of the way in which Caragiale balanced his personal perspective and the generic traits he emphasized: speaking of Leiba Zibal, the Jewish character in O făclie de Paşte who defends himself out of fear, he drew a comparison with Shakespeare's Shylock. He thus noted that, for all the differences in style between the two authors, both their characters stood for the Jewish people as a whole.Ornea, p.50 This assessment was backed by Maiorescu's adversary, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. George Călinescu also believed that, aside from his individual nature, Zibal provided readers with an accurate insight into Jewish reactions to systemic persecution and death threats. Such assessments were rejected by Paul Zarifopol, who opposed generalizations and commented that the work only referred to \\"[t]he ingenious cruelty of a man maddened by fear\\". =Allegories= One of Caragiale's main and earliest types is that of the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clichés—its main representative is O noapte furtunoasă's Rică Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of Ştefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel).Vianu, Vol. II, p.454-455 At the other end are patriarchal figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives' adulterous relations with younger men.Cazimir (1967), p.55-56; Cioculescu, p.56-59, 83–84, 85–88, 113 This behavior is notably present in O noapte furtunoasă, where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac.Cazimir (1967), p.55, 112–119; Cioculescu, p.83-84 A more complex situation is present in O scrisoare pierdută, where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joiţica is having an affair with Tipătescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.Cazimir (1967), p.55, 133–134; Cioculescu, p.85-88 With Venturiano, Caragiale also introduces criticism of the liberal journalist and lawyers. A law school student, Venturiano contributes long and exaggerated articles to the republican press, which recall those authored by C. A. Rosetti and his collaborators.Cioculescu, p.179-180, 183–184; Ornea, p.210-211 A more elaborate such character is Nae Caţavencu, who plays a major part in O scrisoare pierdută, and who, using a \\"Red\\" discourse, attacks politicians on all sides with turbulent remarks and recourse to blackmail.Ornea, p.217-221 He profits from the more moderate attitudes of his adversaries to proclaim himself a progressive politician, and he is successful in doing so—Caţavencu rallies around him a group of teachers and other state employees.Ornea, p.217-219 The only person who is able to stop his rise is Agamiţă Dandanache, an old 1848 revolutionary. Danadanche, shown to have been sidelined from politics, makes a comeback at a time when the factions needs his inoffensive presence as a third-party, and, although senile, has a vast experience in blackmailing.Cazimir (1967), p.143-144; Ornea, p.220-221 Ştefan Cazimir linked Dandanache to a new aristocracy, created around the first generation of Romanian liberals, and likened him to a hidalgo.Cazimir (1967), p.144 Tache Farfuridi, a competitor to both, has been described by Cazimir as a conformist self-seeker, in the manner of M. Joseph Prudhomme, a character made famous by Henri Monnier's prose.Cazimir (1967), p.136-137 Written between the two other comedies, Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea depicts the long-term effects of republican discourse on its fascinated audience, through the sayings and actions of Leonida. The latter, whose source of income is a state pension, notably supports the notion that the \\"Red\\" republic will provide each clerk with a salary, a pension, as well as a debt moratoriumCioculescu, p.334; Ornea, p.215—Şerban Cioculescu noted that this request had already been voiced in real life, and issued as a political program by an obscure Utopian socialist named Piţurcă.Cioculescu, p.334 Eventually, Leonida is convinced that revolution cannot be on the rise, since the authorities have banned the firing of weapons within city limits.Cazimir (1967), p.129; Cioculescu, p.337 Similar fallacies are uttered by one of the secondary characters in D-ale carnavalului, known to the other protagonists as Catindatul, who has a vague familiarity with both subjective idealist and materialist tenets, the sources for his absurd theories about suggestibility and \\"magnetism\\"—two processes in which he sees the universal source for all discomfort or disease.Cazimir (1967), p.155-157 In parallel, Zarifopol argued, the writer had even allowed ironic reflections on the impact of various theories to seep into a more serious work, O făclie de Paşte, where two students terrify the innkeeper Zibal by casually discussing anthropological criminology. Several other of Caragiale's characters have traditionally been considered allegories of social classes and even regional identities. One of the most famous ones is Mitică, a recurring character who stands for ordinary Bucharesters, Wallachians or Muntenians in general. A hypocritical and seemingly superficial man, Mitică expresses himself through either platitudes or clichés he believes are clever, and, illustrating a tendency Caragiale first recorded in his Moftul Român, quickly dismisses all important things he is confronted with. Similarly, the teacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, who is present or named in several sketches, stands for those Transylvanian expatriates in Romania whose sympathies went to the liberal current. His discourse, through which Caragiale sarcastically illustrates liberal tenets in respect to Romanian education, is centered on a disregard for content and a rigor for memorizing irrelevant details. It has been proposed that Rostogan is at least partly based on Vasile Grigore Borgovan, a Transylvanian-born educator and resident of Turnu Severin.Cioculescu, p.254 Cetăţeanul turmentat, an unnamed inebriated man who makes brief but relevant appearances in O scrisoare pierdută, is thought to symbolize simple townsfolk, utterly confused by the political battle going on around them, and ignored by all the notabilities.Cioculescu, p.80; Vianu, Vol.I, p.309; Vol. II, p.201 Like his counterpart, the police agent Ghiţă Pristanda, the inebriated elector has no relevant personal ambition,Cazimir (1967), p.143-149 and stands for the so-called \\"government dowry\\"—people afraid of losing their offices, and ready to back whoever is in power.Cioculescu, p.80-81 According to Călinescu, the inebriated citizen worships authority as a \\"supreme god\\", despite all its absurdities.Cazimir (1967), p.55 He repeatedly claims to have served Trahanache during Alexander John Cuza's ousting, but his supposed patron only acknowledges him once, when asking party members to \\"escort this honorable person outside\\".Cazimir (1967), p.146 In a number of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another particularly Junimist theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of modernization on high society.Ornea, p.222-224 In one sketch, a couple of ladies dine in an opulent salon, while cursing their maid, gossiping, and showing interest in vulgar subjects.Ornea, p.222-223 The characters in these writings tend to resemble each other, evidencing the generic traits of the well-to-do.Ornea, p.223 =Other traits and characters= Anxieties take the central stage in several of Caragiale's writings. From early on, Caragiale's minute analysis of mounting terror in O făclie de Paşte won the praise of Constantin Dobrogeanu- Gherea.Mîndra, p.267 In several of his sketches and stories, characters are driven to despair by their inability to cope with real or presumed changes in their environment.Cioculescu, p.89 This is shown to have happened to characters such as Leiba Zibal, Stavrache—the pub owner in În vreme de război—, as well as Anghelache (the suicide victim in Inspecţiune..., part of Momente şi schiţe).Călinescu, p.180; Cioculescu, p.89 Şerban Cioculescu referred to the latter three as \\"great neurotics\\", while Iosifescu defined Zibal and Stavrache as \\"demented\\". Among the group of insane characters in Caragiale's work, Călinescu counted those of sketches and stories like 1 Aprilie (\\"1st of April\\"), where an April Fool ends with a murder, and Două loturi, where the clerk Lefter Popescu goes through the tribulations of having lost his winning ticket.Cazimir (1967), p.56; Călinescu, p.179-180 Anxiety over imminent events grips the main characters in Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea, and plays a part in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies.Cioculescu, p.83-88, 89–92 A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of D-ale carnavalului, whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally.Cazimir (1967), p.149-157; Cioculescu, p.89-92 Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican suburbanite Miţa Baston, are determined to uncover their partners' amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments of sad meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation.Cazimir (1967), p.149-155 Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis on the fact that Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.Cazimir (1967), p.137-138 Many of Caragiale's writings reproduce discussions between clerks on their time off, which usually take the shape of generic and awkward forays into culture or politics. Several of the characters in his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures of the day, or to have access to the back-rooms of politics and journalism.Cioculescu, p.113, 114 Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the beer garden.Ornea, p.223-224 Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely scoops, such as Bulgaria having decided to invade Romania.Cioculescu, p.114 In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his sensationalist articles while relaxing in the park. Caragiale's persona is placed in numerous of his works. Aside from deduced self-portraits in Cănuţă om sucit and elsewhere, he created the famous background character Nenea Iancu (\\"Uncle Iancu\\"), building on his colloquial name and his status as a regular client of the beer gardens.Vianu, Vol. II, p.204 He introduces several of his Momente şi schiţe characters as personal friends, and garnishes the stories with intimate details.Cioculescu, p.56-57 Late in his life, he even confessed that the affair involving Venturiano, Dumitrache, and Dumitrache's wife Veta was partly based on an amorous misadventure he experienced as a young man.Cioculescu, p.279 Literary influences We are all honest people, let's embrace one another, and let this be over with, 1834 print by Honoré Daumier Aside from the many authors whose works he quoted, translated or parodied, Ion Luca Caragiale built on a vast literary legacy. According to literary historian Ştefan Cazimir: \\"No writer ever had as large a number of precursors [as Caragiale], just as no other artistic synthesis was ever more organic and more spontaneous.\\"Cazimir (1967), p.63-64 A man of the theater first and foremost, Caragiale was well-acquainted with the work of his predecessors, from William Shakespeare to the Romantics, and heavily impressed by the French comédie en vaudeville. He applied the notion of well-made plays, as theorized by Eugène Scribe, and was also influenced by the dramaturgy of Eugène Marin Labiche and Victorien Sardou.Cazimir (1967), p.96-101; Vianu, Vol. I, p.310-311, 314 Reportedly, Labiche was his favorite author.Cazimir (1967), p.98 The writer himself cited Cilibi Moise, a Wallachian Jewish peddler and aphorist, as an early influence, recalling how, as a child, he used to read his one-liner jokes, and treasured them as exceptional samples of concise humor.Cazimir (1967), p.62 He was similarly impressed by the works of Moise's contemporary, the prolific author Anton Pann, whose accomplishments he praised during talks with his fellow Convorbiri Critice contributors, and whose work served as a source for at least one of his own stories. Nicolae Filimon, whom Caragiale praised on several occasions, was the author of short stories which several authors have identified as less accomplished versions of Rică Venturiano.Cazimir (1967), p.82-84 A similar connection has been traced between the various sketches authored by Ion Heliade Rădulescu, in which Transylvanian writers are the object of ridicule, and Caragiale's character Marius Chicoş Rostogan.Cazimir (1967), p.84-86 Caragiale's late admiration for Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu was also linked to affinities in comedic styles,Cazimir (1967), p.86-89 as was his companionship with Iacob Negruzzi (himself the author of sarcastic pieces ridiculing the liberal politicians and lawyers).Cazimir (1967), p.89-93; Vianu, Vol.II, p.88 Caragiale is also believed to have used and developed several themes already present in Romanian theater. One such precursor is the author of comedies Teodor Myller, especially through his play Fata lui Chir Troancă (\\"Kir Troancă's Daughter\\").Cioculescu, p.181-182 The writer was most likely very familiar with the comedies authored by his two uncles, Costache and Iorgu, which have been shown to develop themes he later explored in depth.Cazimir (1967), p.73-76 Among the minor 19th century dramatists whose comedic works were familiar to Caragiale, and in many ways similar to his, own was Costache Halepliu.Cazimir (1967), p.76-79 Another often-cited influence is his predecessor and adversary Vasile Alecsandri, whose Coana Chiriţa plays are an early critique of Westernization.Cazimir (1967), p.70-72 The two authors nonetheless differ in many ways, with Caragiale assuming a more complex role, and observing a more complex society.Cazimir (1967), p.72; Mîndra, p.32 Ion Luca Caragiale is known to have been amused by the stock character Robert Macaire, at a time when the latter had been turned into a comedic character by Frédérick Lemaître.Cazimir (1967), p.102-103 While in Berlin, he purchased the cartoons of French artists Honoré Daumier and Paul Gavarni (although it is not known if their separate portrayals of Macaire were familiar to him)Cazimir (1967), p.103-105—among these drawings was one showing notabilities embracing one another while picking each other's pockets, which shows similarities with Caragiale's own take on society.Cazimir (1967), p.104 According to Cazimir, it is possible that he knew Daumier's work from early on, as several other subjects caricatured by the French artist bear a remarkable resemblance to his texts. Ion Luca Caragiale was also keenly aware and receptive of his contemporaries' works and of fin de siècle innovations. The literary creations of Émile Zola were a noted source of inspiration, and the parallel led George Călinescu to propose him and Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea as the main representatives of Zola's style in local literature. At the same time, Constantin Dobrogeanu- Gherea believed that both Năpasta and O făclie de Paşte showed the \\"obvious enough influence\\" of Fyodor Dostoevsky. Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Dl Panu asupra criticii şi literaturii (wikisource) Late in his life, Caragiale discovered the literature of Anatole France—according to Paul Zarifopol, France's Humanist themes served as a model for some of Caragiale's fantasy writings. Discussing the latter works, Vianu noted that they reminded one of Shakespeare's late romances, while Şerban Cioculescu believed them to have been indirectly inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe. In his report for the Academy, Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio also drew a parallel between Poe's works and La hanul lui Mânjoală, but this hypothesis was rejected by Zarifopol. In addition, Kir Ianulea, partly using Niccolò Machiavelli's novel as a source, was held as evidence of Caragiale's interest in Renaissance literature.Vianu, Vol. I, p.313, 314 Cultural legacy The writer's investigations into Romanian culture also resulted in an accurate record of the Romanian language as it was spoken during his day, sampling dialects, jargon, slang, verbal tics, as well as illustrating the experiments undertaken by conflicting schools of linguistics during the 19th and early 20th century, as well as the traces they left on the Romanian lexis.Vianu, Vol. II, p.203-204, 240–241; Vol.III, p.246 In Tudor Vianu's opinion, this was partly owed to his keen musical ear.Vianu, Vol. II, p.203 Caragiale was an enduring influence on both Romanian humor and the views Romanians take of themselves.Lucian Boia, Romania: Borderland of Europe, Reaktion Books, London, 2001, p.247. His comedies and various stories have produced a series of catchphrases, many of which are still present in both cultural reference. Nevertheless, his uncomfortable criticism has occasionally seen him assigned a secondary place in the Romanian curriculum and the academic discourse, a tendency notably endorsed by the Iron Guard (Romania's main fascist movement) and the Communist regime. In parallel, Caragiale's techniques have influenced 20th century dramatists such as Mihail Sorbul, Victor Ion Popa, Mihail Sebastian, and George Mihail Zamfirescu,Mîndra, p.33 and various directors, beginning with Constantin I. Nottara and Paul Gusti. Several of his theatrical writings have been the subject of essays authored by director Sică Alexandrescu, whose interpretation of the texts made use of the Stanislavsky System.Cioculescu, p.325-342 Caragiale's short stories and novellas have inspired authors such as Ioan A. Bassarabescu, Gheorghe Brăescu, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti, Dumitru D. Pătrăşcanu, I. Peltz,Cioculescu, p.172 and, in later decades, Radu Cosaşu, Ioan Lăcustă, Horia Gârbea and Dumitru Radu Popa.Cristea-Enache, chapters \\"Filo-logia şi alte iubiri\\", \\"Dumitru Radu Popa. American Dream\\", \\"Mircea Cărtărescu. Levantul pe orizontală\\", \\"Ioan Lăcustă. Un prozator profund\\", \\"Horia Gârbea. Un computer cu talent\\" According to various authors, Caragiale was also a predecessor of Absurdism, and he is known to have been cited as an influence by the Absurdist dramatist Eugène Ionesco. Outside Romania, the impact of Ion Luca Caragiale's literature was much reduced—the 1996 Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre attributed this to the technical problems posed by translations, as well as to the tendency of staging his works as period pieces.Sarah Stanton, Martin Banham, The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996, p.56.

Annual theater festivals in his honor are held in Bucharest and the Moldovan capital of Chişinău. Caragiale's work has been the subject of many productions in Romanian cinema and television—films based on his writings include the 1958 Două lozuri and Lucian Pintilie's 1981 De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?. In 1982, a West German film, directed by Radu Garbea and based on O făclie de Paşte, was released as Fürchte dich nicht, Jakob!. The Bucharest National Theater is currently known in full as \\"Ion Luca Caragiale\\" National Theater. Several educational institutions were named in his, including the Theater and Film Academy and the Ion Luca Caragiale National College in Bucharest, the national college in Ploieşti, and a high school in Moreni. Among the statues raised in his honor are Constantin Baraschi's Bucharest monument, and busts in the capital's Cişmigiu Gardens and in Ploieşti. He was the subject of portraits and caricatures by various artists, and, in 2007, upon the completion of a five- year project involving cartoonists inside and outside Romania, he was designated \\"the most portrayed writer\\" by the Guinness Book of Records (with over 1,500 individual drawings in a single exhibit). \\"Portretele lui Caragiale expuse din nou la Madrid\\", at Antena 3, 11 September 2007.

The legislature is bicameral and consists of the lower South Carolina House of Representatives and the upper South Carolina Senate. All together, the General Assembly consists of 170 members. The legislature convenes at the State House in Columbia. Prior to the 1964 federal Reynolds v. Sims decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, the House of Representatives was apportioned so that each county had a number of representatives based on population, with each county guaranteed at least one representative, while each county had one Senator. Moreover, each county's General Assembly delegation also doubled as its county council, as the state constitution made no provision for local government. Reynolds v. Sims caused district lines to cross county lines, causing legislators to be on multiple county councils. This led to the passage of the Home Rule Act of 1975, which created county councils that were independent of the General Assembly. However, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local government. As a result, the legislature still devotes considerable time to local matters, and county legislative delegations still handle many matters that are handled by county governments in the rest of the country. There are 124 members of the South Carolina House of Representatives, who are elected every two years, and the South Carolina Senate has 46 members, elected every four years concurrent to the presidential election. For both houses, there are no term limits. The General Assembly meets in joint session to elect judges, with all 170 members having an equal vote in such elections.

G. K. Mikhailov, Second Antique Gallery at the Academy of Arts (1836) Egyptian sphinxes lining Academy Quay (1835) The Russian Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, informally known as the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts, was founded in 1757 by the founder of the Imperial Moscow University Ivan Shuvalov under the name Academy of the Three Noblest Arts. Catherine the Great renamed it the Imperial Academy of Arts and commissioned a new building, completed 25 years later in 1789 by the Neva River. The academy promoted the neoclassical style and technique, and sent its promising students to European capitals for further study. Training at the academy was virtually required for artists to make successful careers. Formally abolished in 1918 after the Russian Revolution, the academy was renamed several times. It established free tuition; students from across the country competed fiercely for its few places annually. In 1947 the national institution was moved to Moscow, and much of its art collection was moved to the Hermitage. The building in Leningrad was devoted to the Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, named in honor of one of Russia's foremost realist artists. Since 1991 it has been called the St. Petersburg Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.  In Imperial Russia  The academy was located in the Shuvalov Palace on Sadovaya Street. In 1764, Catherine the Great renamed it the Imperial Academy of Arts and commissioned its first rector, Alexander Kokorinov, to design a new building. It took 25 years to complete the Neoclassical edifice, which opened in 1789. Konstantin Thon was responsible for the sumptuous decoration of the interiors. He also designed a quayside in front of the building, with stairs down to the Neva River, and adorned it with two 3000-year-old sphinxes, which were transported from Egypt. Ivan Betskoy reorganized the academy into a de facto government department; it supervised matters concerning art throughout the country, distributing orders and awarding ranks to artists. The academy vigorously promoted the principles of Neoclassicism by sending the most notable Russian painters abroad, in order to learn the ancient and Renaissance styles of Italy and France. It also had its own sizable collection of choice artworks intended for study and copying. In the mid-19th-century, the Academism of training staff, much influenced by the doctrines of Dominique Ingres, was challenged by a younger generation of Russian artists who asserted their freedom to paint in a Realistic style. The adherents of this movement became known as peredvizhniki (Itinerants, related to their desire to bring art to the people). Led by Ivan Kramskoi, they publicly broke with the Academy and organized their own exhibitions, which traveled from town to town across Russia. Ilya Repin, Mikhail Vrubel and some other painters still regarded the academy's training as indispensable for the development of basic professional and technical skills. =Higher Art School of the Academy of Arts= In 1893, Imperial Academy of Arts was divided into the Academy of Arts itself, which was responsible for all the artistic work in the Russian Empire, and the Higher Art School of the Academy of Arts, which dealt only with academic affairs. The initiator of the reform was the vice- president of the Academy, Count Ivan Ivanovich Tolstoy. The Charter, approved at the end of 1893, divided the former Academy into two institutions: * Academy itself (Academic «Assembly» consisting of the President, Vice- president, Conference secretary, 60 Full members and 20 Honorary members of the Academy), a state institution «for the maintenance, development and dissemination of art in Russia». * Educational institution — Higher Art School at the Academy, managed by the «Council of Professors» with the Rector at the head. Both institutions were located in St. Petersburg in the historic building of the Academy of Arts. Instead of the old professors, peredvizhniki artists were invited to teaching positions at the Higher Art School. The program of study at the Higher School has changed significantly: the institute of professors and managers was established and free topics for competitive tests were established. New professors came to the academy, among whom Ilya Repin stood out. Famous artists were invited by the heads of personal workshops: Vladimir Makovsky, Ivan Shishkin, Arkhip Kuindzhi, Aleksey Kivshenko. Later came: Alexander Kiselyov, Dmitry Kardovsky, Nikolay Dubovskoy, Nikolay Samokish, Vasily Mate. =Big Gold Medal of the Imperial Academy of Arts= Big Gold Medal of the Imperial Academy of Arts The Big Gold Medal, which granted the right to a foreign pensioner (from three to six years), was awarded in a competition to which the most talented graduates of the Academy were allowed to complete their studies, awarded to the beginning of the competition with the small gold medal of the Academy «For Success in Drawing». Graduates who received a large gold medal remained at the Academy of Arts for another year; they were provided with a separate workshop, materials for work and a generous cash allowance. Those admitted to the competition were obliged to execute the «program», to draw a picture according to the program (creative task), one for all, approved by the Council of the Academy of Arts. The task, most often on a historical theme, was made in such a way that the participant showed all the professional skills and knowledge that he mastered during his studies. * :Category:Awarded with a large gold medal of the Academy of Arts =Personalities of the Imperial Academy of Arts= * :Category:Imperial Academy of Arts alumni * Members of the Imperial Academy of Arts * Full Members of the Imperial Academy of Arts  In the Soviet Union  After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Imperial Academy passed through a series of transformations. It was formally abolished in 1918 and the Petrograd Free Art Educational Studios (Pegoskhuma) created in its place; this was renamed the Petrograd Svomas (Free Art Studios) in 1919, the Petrograd State Art-Educational Studios of the Reconstructed Academy of Arts in 1921, Vkhutein in 1928, the Institute of Proletarian Fine Arts in 1930, the Russian Academy of Arts in 1933, and the Academy of Arts of the USSR in 1947. After the Academy's move to Moscow that year, the building in what was then called Leningrad was renamed Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. The national academy has stayed in Moscow. In 1991 it was renamed the Russian Academy of Arts. The old academy's art collection, which included major works by Poussin, David and Ingres, was removed to the Hermitage Museum across the river. During the Soviet era, academies were free of tuition fees as they were financed by the government, but admission was intensely competitive. Many would-be students would apply to the Academy for as many as six or seven years in a row without success. With just twenty places available and thousands of applicants, the competition was brutal. =Graduates of Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute (1930–1950)= Well-known graduates of Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1930–1950s include: * :Category:Repin Institute of Arts alumni  Current situation  The Russian Academy of Arts has been headquartered in Moscow since 1947.

It forms in low temperature, high pressure environments typical of subduction zones at convergent plate boundaries. Benitoite fluoresces under short wave ultraviolet light, appearing bright blue to bluish white in color. The more rarely seen clear to white benitoite crystals fluoresce red under long-wave UV light. It was discovered in 1907 by prospector James M. Couch in the San Benito Mountains roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Couch originally believed the mineral was a corundum mineral known as sapphire due to its resemblance of color. In 1909, a sample was sent to the University of California, Berkeley where mineralogist Dr. George D. Louderback realized it was a previously unknown mineral. Corundum (sapphire) has a defined Mohs hardness of 9, while benitoite is much softer. He named it benitoite for its occurrence near the headwaters of the San Benito River in San Benito County, California. Benitoite occurs in a number of isolated locations globally, but gemstone quality material has only been found in California at the Benito Gem Mine where it was first discovered. It has been correctly identified in Montana, Arkansas, Japan, and Australia although they formed under slightly different conditions and only grow large enough to be considered an accessory mineral. In 1985 benitoite was named as the official state gem of California. Benitoite has a rare 5 pointed twinned crystal form, and an even rarer 6 pointed twinned crystal form, \\"star of David\\". Associated minerals and locations Benitoite typically occurs with an unusual set of minerals, along with minerals that make up its host rock. Frequently associated minerals include: natrolite, neptunite, joaquinite, serpentine and albite. Benitoite is a rare mineral found in very few locations including San Benito County, California, Japan and Arkansas. In the San Benito occurrence, it is found in natrolite veins within glaucophane schist within a serpentinite body.

St Helens eruption plume on 22 July 1980, showing ejecta in the form of pyroclastic material (ash) Ejecta (from the Latin: \\"things thrown out\\", singular ejectum) are particles ejected from an area. In volcanology, in particular, the term refers to particles including pyroclastic materials (tephra) that came out of a volcanic explosion and magma eruption volcanic vent, or crater, has traveled through the air or under water, and fell back on the ground surface or on the ocean floor.  Volcanology  Typically in volcanology, ejecta is a result of explosive eruptions. In an explosive eruption, large amounts of gas are dissolved in extremely viscous lava; this lava froths to the surface until the material is expelled rapidly due to the trapped pressure. Sometimes in such an event a lava plug or volcanic neck forms from lava that solidifies inside a volcano's vent, causing heat and pressure to build up to an extreme with no way to escape. When the blockage breaks and cannot sustain itself any longer, a more violent eruption occurs, which allows materials to be ejected out of the volcano., Volcanic Neck, Volcanic Plug, USGS., Ejecta, Natural Resources Canada. Ejecta can consist of: # juvenile particles – (fragmented magma and free crystals) # cognate or accessory particles – older volcanic rocks from the same volcano # accidental particles – derived from the rocks under the volcano These particles may vary in size; tephra can range from ash (<1/10in), lapilli (little stones from 1/10 in to 2 ½ in) or volcanic bombs (2.5 in+).

Planetary geology  In planetary geology, the term \\"ejecta\\" includes debris ejected during the formation of an impact crater. When an object massive enough hits another object with enough force, it creates a shockwave that spreads out from the impact. The object breaks and excavates into the ground and rock, at the same time spraying material known as impact ejecta. This ejecta is distributed outward from the crater's rim onto the surface as debris; it can be loose material or a blanket of debris, which thins at the outermost regions. , Lunar and Planetary Institute. If enough ejecta are deposited around an impact crater, it can form an ejecta blanket; this blanket is full of dust and debris that originated from the initial impact. The size of this impact crater along with the ejecta blanket can be used to determine the size and intensity of the impacting object. On earth, these ejecta blankets can be analyzed to determine the source location of the impact. [https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia07368.html ], Titan Impact Crater.

Its high school and Pre-K through eighth- grade campuses are located in Pebble Beach and an unincorporated area of neighboring Carmel, respectively. History In 1952 Robert and Marian Ricklefs established a boarding school on the Monterey Peninsula which they named in honor of Robert Louis Stevenson, the well-known Scottish author who reportedly found inspiration for his tales of high adventure during his 1870s sojourn in the Monterey area. Many of the school buildings, the school newspaper, sports teams, and other features of the school are named for places or themes from Robert Louis Stevenson's life or writings.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stevenson-school-continues-momentum- astroturf-160000184.html In the early years, Stevenson was a boys' school offering education in grades 7-12, though grades 7-8 were discontinued when the high school expanded. The Pebble Beach Campus has had an Episcopalian chaplain from the early days, though the school has always been open to students of all faiths. The school considers itself to be non-sectarian and explicit religious instruction is not included in the curriculum. In 1987, the Church in the ForestChurch in the Forest was established in Erdman Memorial Chapel on the Pebble Beach campus, initially with both Episcopalian and Methodist chaplains.History of Church in the Forest The chapel is used by some local residents, and is where boarding students attend vespers. Robert Ricklefs served as headmaster until he retired in 1970; he was succeeded by Gordon Davis, during whose term (1970-1982) the school opened its doors to girls as day students (1976).Stevenson School: About Joe Wandke arrived in 1983, and during his administration the school has undergone a thorough renovation of the physical plant. In 1988 girls were first admitted as boarding students with the opening of the Silverado dormitory. Also in 1988, the school was approached by the board of Briarcliff Academy, a private elementary school in the unincorporated area of Carmel Woods, north of Carmel, regarding a merger of the two schools. Stevenson then became a two-campus school comprising grades kindergarten through 12. The Carmel Campus (grades K through 8, adding Pre-K in September 2011) is located in Carmel, while the Pebble Beach Campus (grades 9-12) occupies the original school's location in Pebble Beach. In 2003 the Rosen Family Student Center was opened. Located in the middle of the Pebble Beach campus, the building features a college center, photography lab, tech center, activities center, wilderness center, multiple classroom, and the new location of KSPB 91.9. The building is decorated with plush rugs and also features an amphitheater stage, which hosts school assemblies and concerts. In 2015, it was announced that Stevenson graduate Kevin Hicks would succeed Wandke as president. Extracurricular activities ;Athletics Stevenson fields varsity teams in tennis, golf, baseball, basketball, American football, lacrosse, field hockey, swimming, water polo, and sailing, among others. In 2018, Stevenson installed a new AstroTurf field for soccer and lacrosse.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stevenson-school- continues-momentum-astroturf-160000184.html Historically, Stevenson has fielded strong teams in tennis, golf, lacrosse, and soccer.

Settlers first arrived in that area in 1765; the village's namesake, Dr. Joseph Lewis, arrived two years later. From the late 19th century, the village was centered on a rail station that was used by both Norwich and the town directly across the Connecticut River, Hanover, New Hampshire. Because of the rail station, built in 1884, Lewiston became important to surrounding towns on both sides of the Connecticut River and to Dartmouth College in Hanover. The coal that Dartmouth used to heat its buildings came through this station. By the 1920s, however, the economic importance of Lewiston to the neighboring regions decreased. Dartmouth began using oil instead of coal, and all the mills in Lewiston were gone by 1930. The railroad remains today, though the station is not used for its original purpose. In 1950, lower-lying farm areas were flooded when the Wilder Dam was constructed downstream. In 1967, almost all of Lewiston was razed to make way for Interstate 91 and its access road from Hanover. The railroad, a Dartmouth College-owned pottery studio (in the house once owned by Dr. Joseph Lewis), and a small road off McKenna Road, Lewiston Hill Road, make up some of the area where the center of the village of Lewiston was situated.

Depending on the location of the parking space, the time allowed to park may be fixed by regulation, and a fee may be required to use the parking space. It may be designated for free parking. When the demand for spaces outstrips supply vehicles may overspill park onto the sidewalk, grass verges and other places which were not designed for the purpose.  Patterns  For most motorised vehicles, there are three commonly used arrangements of parking spaces—parallel parking, perpendicular parking, and angle parking. These are self-park configurations where the vehicle driver is able to access the parking independently. = Parallel parking = With parallel parking of cars, these are arranged in a line, with the front bumper of one car facing the back bumper of an adjacent one. This is done parallel to a curb, when one is provided. Parallel parking is the most common mode of streetside parking for cars. It may also be used in parking lots and parking structures, but usually only to supplement parking spaces that use the other modes. = Perpendicular parking = Bombala's (perpendicular) back-in parking style. With perpendicular parking, also known as bay parking, cars are parked side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall. This type of car parking fits more cars per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking, and is therefore commonly used in car parking lots and car parking structures. Vehicles parked on the side of a street in Leipzig, Germany Often, in car parking lots using perpendicular parking, two rows of parking spaces may be arranged front to front, with aisles in between. If no other cars are blocking, a driver may perform a \\"pullthrough\\" by driving through one parking space into the connecting space to avoid having to reverse out of a parking space upon their return. Sometimes, a single row of perpendicular car parking spaces is marked in the center of a street. This arrangement eliminates reversing from the manoeuvre; cars are required to drive in forwards and drive out forwards. = Angle parking/echelon parking = Angle parking along the Southsea seafront, England. Angle parking, known as echelon parking in Britain, is similar to perpendicular parking for these vehicles, except that cars are arranged at an angle to the aisle (an acute angle with the direction of approach). The gentler turn allows easier and quicker parking, narrower aisles, and thus higher density than perpendicular parking. While in theory the aisles are one- way, in practice they are typically wide enough to allow two cars to pass slowly when drivers go down the aisles the wrong way. Angle parking is very common in car parking lots. It may also be used in streetside car parking in the U.S. when there is more width available for car parking than would be needed for parallel parking of cars, as it creates a larger number of parking spaces. Some cities have utilized angled parking on-street (as compared to off-street parking facilities). This has been done mostly in residential, retail and mixed use areas where additional parking compared to parallel parking is desired and traffic volumes are lower. Most angled parking is design in a head-in configuration while a few cities (Seattle, Portland, Baltimore, and Indianapolis are examples) have some back-in angled parking (typically on hills or low traffic volume streets). Angle parking is considered dangerous by cycling organisations, especially in the head-in configuration, but unwelcome in either form. When comparing to parallel parking: # There is a significant risk to cyclists from vehicles reversing out, as approaching bicycles are in the blind spot of the reversing and turning vehicles.UK Department of Transport Cycle Infrastructure Design # Longer vehicles project further into the road; this can inconvenience/endanger other road users, # The \\"surplus\\" road space which enables angle parking could also be used for bicycle lanes. Hence organisations such as the Cyclists Touring Club are usually opposed to all proposed echelon parking schemes, though there are some alternatives, such as back-in angle parking (slanted the \\"wrong\\" way, with the driver reversing into the space, rather than reversing out), which can overcome many of the issues of safety. = Other parking methods = Besides these basic modes of motor vehicle parking, there are instances where a more ad hoc approach to arranging motor vehicles is appropriate. For example, in parts of some large cities, such as Chicago and Bangalore, where land is expensive and therefore parking space is at a premium, there are formal and informal parking lots for motor vehicles where the driver leaves the keys to the vehicle with an attendant who arranges vehicles so as to maximize the number of vehicles that can be parked in the lot. Vehicles may be packed up to five vehicles deep in combinations of perpendicular and/or parallel parking with limited circulation aisles for the parking attendant. Such arrangements are known as attendant parking. When the lot or facility is provided to serve the customers of a business, it is considered valet parking. Inner city parking lots are often temporary, the operators renting land which is vacant pending the construction of a new office building. Some inner city lots are equipped with individual lifts, allowing cars to be stored above each other. Another ad hoc arrangement is tandem parking. This is sometimes done with residential motor vehicle parking where two motor vehicles park nose-to-end in tandem. The first motor vehicle does not have independent access, and the second motor vehicle must move to provide access. As with attendant parking, the purpose is to maximize the number of motor vehicles that can park in a limited space. Formalised tandem parking will sometimes be sanctioned by local planning authorities for staff parking arrangements require additional parking in limited spaces. Marks and space size Street with spaces marked for parallel parking Parking lot in Épône railstation (France). In parking lots (car parks in British English), parking is allowed only where marked. In the US, minimum width standards of parking spaces usually range from . Angled and perpendicular spaces may need to be wide to allow doors to open, while parallel parking spots may be narrower on low-traffic neighborhood streets. Because the boundary between parking space and driving area is not always well-defined, the length of a parking space is more difficult to establish. However, most angled and perpendicular spaces are considered to be between in length. In the United States, due to vehicles being larger on average than some other countries, a parking space deep is uncommon and most parking spaces will be within , with feet deep being the standard DOT recommended depth for standard perpendicular parking. Parallel parking spaces typically range from long. During construction, the specific dimensions of a parking space are decided by a variety of factors. A high cost of land will encourage smaller dimensions and the introduction of compact spaces.A Comprehensive Menu of Solutions to Parking Problems Victoria Transport Policy Institute Many garages and parking lots have spaces designated for a Compact car only. These spaces are narrower than traditional spaces, thus allowing more cars to park. According to French standard \\"Norme NF P 91-100\\", minimum width of parking spaces range from (See :fr:Marquage du stationnement en France). Narrow parking spaces such as in Vevey, Switzerland, might make opening the door difficult in a larger vehicle. Larger cars are an issue when the size of the bay is fixed. Automobile associations warn of this issue. A Swiss Association regulating parking space wants to consider this issue for 2016. In the United Kingdom, the recommended standard parallel bay size is wide by long. Recently there has been some controversy about most UK parking spaces being too small to fit modern cars, which have grown significantly since standards were set decades ago. In Australia, the dimensions are defined in AS2890 and are 2.4 m wide by 5.4 m long.

Local highway agencies may prescribe special colors for curb markings to supplement standard signs for parking regulation. California has designated an array of colors for curb regulations. A white curb designates passenger pick up or drop off. The green curb is for time limited parking. The yellow curb is for loading, and the blue curb is for disabled persons with proper vehicle identification. The red curb is for emergency vehicles only - fire lanes (no stopping, standing, or parking). In Oregon and Florida, the yellow curb is utilized to indicate no parking. In Georgia either red or yellow can be used to indicate no parking. In Seattle, Washington, alternating red and yellow curb markings indicate a bus stop.

One of the most prolific Romanian-language writers, he is remembered mostly for his historical and adventure novels, as well as for his nature writing. An author whose career spanned five decades, Sadoveanu was an early associate of the traditionalist magazine Sămănătorul, before becoming known as a Realist writer and an adherent to the Poporanist current represented by Viața Românească journal. His books, critically acclaimed for their vision of age-old solitude and natural abundance, are generally set in the historical region of Moldavia, building on themes from Romania's medieval and early modern history. Among them are Neamul Șoimăreștilor (\\"The Șoimărești Family\\"), Frații Jderi (\\"The Jderi Brothers\\") and Zodia Cancerului (\\"Under the Sign of the Crab\\"). With Venea o moară pe Siret... (\\"A Mill Was Floating down the Siret...\\"), Baltagul (\\"The Hatchet\\") and some other works of fiction, Sadoveanu extends his fresco to contemporary history and adapts his style to the psychological novel, Naturalism and Social realism. A traditionalist figure whose perspective on life was a combination of nationalism and Humanism, Sadoveanu moved between right- and left-wing political forces throughout the interwar period, while serving terms in Parliament. Rallying with People's Party, the National Agrarian Party, and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, he was editor of the leftist newspapers Adevărul and Dimineața, and was the target of a violent far right press campaign. After World War II, Sadoveanu became a political associate of the Romanian Communist Party. He wrote in favor of the Soviet Union and Stalinism, joined the Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union and adopted Socialist realism. Many of his texts and speeches, including the political novel Mitrea Cocor and the famous slogan Lumina vine de la Răsărit (\\"The Light Arises in the East\\"), are also viewed as propaganda in favor of communization. A founding member of the Romanian Writers' Society and later President of the Romanian Writers' Union, Sadoveanu was also a member of the Romanian Academy since 1921 and a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize for 1961. He was also Grand Master of the Romanian Freemasonry during the 1930s. The father of Profira and Paul-Mihu Sadoveanu, who also pursued careers as writers, he was the brother-in-law of literary critic Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan. Biography =Early years= Sadoveanu was born in Pașcani, in western Moldavia. His father's family hailed from the southwestern part of the Old Kingdom, in Oltenia.Călinescu, p.615; Crohmălniceanu, p.192; Vianu, Vol.III, p.233 Their place of origin, Sadova, provided their chosen surname (lit. \\"from Sadova\\"),Călinescu, p.615 which was adopted by the family only in 1891. \\"Mihail Sadoveanu\\", biographical note in Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914) database, at the University of Florence's Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved April 7, 2008 Cornel Ungureanu, \\"Mihail Sadoveanu - secțiuni dintr-o geografie literară\\", in Convorbiri Literare, February 2006 Mihail's father was the lawyer Alexandru Sadoveanu (d. 1921), whom literary critic George Călinescu described as \\"a bearded and well- to-do man\\"; according to the writer's own notes, Alexandru was unhappy in marriage, and his progressive isolation from public life impacted on the entire family.Crohmălniceanu, p.193 Mihail's mother, Profira née Ursachi (or Ursaki; d. 1895), hailed from a line of Moldavian shepherds,Călinescu, p.615; Crohmălniceanu, p.192-193, 213-214; Vianu, Vol.III, p.233-235 all of whom, as the writer recalled, had been illiterate.Vianu, Vol.III, p.233 Literary historian Tudor Vianu believes this contrast of regional and social identities played a part in shaping the author, opening him up to a \\"Romanian universality\\", but notes that, throughout his career, Sadoveanu was especially connected with his Moldavian roots.Vianu, Vol.III, p.235 Mihail had a brother, also named Alexandru, whose wife was the Swiss-educated literary critic Izabela Morțun (later known as Sadoveanu-Evan, she was the cousin of socialist activist Vasile Morțun).Călinescu, p.667 Another one of his brothers, Vasile Sadoveanu, was an agricultural engineer. Mihail Constantineanu, Sadoveanu în ultimul an de viață - Neverosimila vacanță, at the Memoria Library; retrieved April 6, 2008 Beginning in 1887, Sadoveanu attended primary school in Pașcani. His favorite teacher, a Mr. Busuioc, later served as inspiration for one of his best-known short stories, Domnu Trandafir (\\"Master Trandafir\\").Călinescu, p.615; Crohmălniceanu, p.193, 214 While away from school, young Sadoveanu used much of his spare time exploring his native region on foot, hunting, fishing, or just contemplating nature.Crohmălniceanu, p.193, 213-214; Vianu, Vol.III, p.237-238 He was also spending his vacations in his mother's native Verșeni.Crohmălniceanu, p.193, 194 During his journeys, Sadoveanu visited peasants, and his impression of the way in which they were relating to authority is credited by critics with having shaped his perspective on society.Crohmălniceanu, p.193, 194; Vianu, Vol.III, p.238 Shortly after this episode, the young Sadoveanu left to complete his secondary studies in Fălticeni and at the National High School in Iași.Călinescu, p.615; Crohmălniceanu, p.193-194 Mihail Sadoveanu.

Dragoslav, but, having lost interest in schoolwork, he failed to get his remove, before eventually graduating top of his class. =First literary attempts, marriage and family= In 1896, when he was aged sixteen, Sadoveanu gave thought to writing a monograph on Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, \\"Calendar. Click istoric\\" , in Jurnalul Național, October 19, 2007 but his first literary attempts date from the following year.Vianu, Vol.III, p.205. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.194. It was in 1897 that a sketch story, titled Domnișoara M din Fălticeni (\\"Miss M from Fălticeni\\") and signed Mihai din Pașcani (\\"Mihai from Pașcani\\"), was successfully submitted for publishing to the Bucharest-based satirical magazine Dracu. He started writing for Ovid Densusianu's journal Vieața Nouă in 1898. His contributions, featured alongside those of Gala Galaction, N. D. Cocea, and Tudor Arghezi, include another sketch story and a lyric poem.Crohmălniceanu, p.194 Sadoveanu was however dissatisfied with Densusianu's agenda, and critical of the entire Romanian Symbolist movement for which the review spoke. He ultimately began writing pieces for non- Symbolist magazines such as Opinia and Pagini Literare. In parallel, he founded and printed by hand a short-lived journal, known to researches as either Aurora or Lumea. Sadoveanu left for Bucharest in 1900, intending to study Law at the University's Faculty of Law, but withdrew soon after, deciding to dedicate himself to literature.Crohmălniceanu, p.195 He began frequenting the bohemian society in the capital, but, following a sudden change in outlook, abandoned poetry and focused his work entirely on Realist prose. In 1901, Sadoveanu married Ecaterina Bâlu, with whom he settled in Fălticeni,Crohmălniceanu, p.195, 214 where he began work on his first novellas and decided to make his living as a professional writer. His first draft for a novel, Frații Potcoavă (\\"The Potcoavă Brothers\\"), came out in 1902, when fragments were published by Pagini Alese magazine under the pseudonym M. S. Cobuz. Ion Simuț, \\"Centenarul debutului sadovenian\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 41/2004 The following year, Sadoveanu was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, stationed as a guard near Târgu Ocna, and inspired by the experience to write some of his first social criticism narratives. After that time, he spent much of his home in the country, where he raised a large family.Călinescu, p.615; Crohmălniceanu, p.196 Initially, the Sadoveanus lived in a house previously owned by celebrated Moldavian raconteur Ion Creangă, before they commissioned a new building, famed for its surrounding Grădina Liniștii (\\"Garden of Quietude\\"). He was the father of eleven, among whom were three daughters: Despina, Teodora and Profira Sadoveanu, the latter of whom was a poet and a novelist. Antonio Patraș, \\"Cu Profira Sadoveanu, în dulcele stil clasic\\", in Convorbiri Literare, December 2007 Of his sons, Dimitrie Sadoveanu became a painter, while Paul-Mihu, the youngest (born 1920), was author of the novel Ca floarea câmpului...

Nicolae Iorga is credited as the editor in chief, Sadoveanu and Ștefan Octavian Iosif are two of the other editors After receiving an invitation from poet Ștefan Octavian Iosif in 1903,Vianu, Vol.III, p.243. According to Crohmălniceanu (p.195-196), Sadoveanu was personally invited to contribute by fellow writer Zaharia Bârsan, but felt closest to Iosif. Sadoveanu contributed works to the traditionalist journal Sămănătorul, led at the time by historian and critic Nicolae Iorga. He was by then also a contributor to Voința Națională, a newspaper published by the National Liberal Party and managed by politician Vintilă Brătianu—beginning December of the same year, the paper serialized Șoimii (\\"The Hawks\\"), an extended variant of Frații Potcoavă, with an introduction by historian Vasile Pârvan. In 1904, he regained Bucharest, where he became a copyist for the Ministry of Education's Board of Schools, returning to Fălticeni two years later.Vianu, Vol.III, p.244 After 1906, he rallied with the group formed around Viața Românească, which was also joined by his sister-in-law Izabela. Sămănătorul and Viața Românească, having comparable influence over the literature of Romania, stood for a traditionalist and ruralist approach to art, even though the latter adopted a more left-wing perspective, known as Poporanism. The leading Poporanist ideologue, Garabet Ibrăileanu, became a personal friend of the young writer after inviting him on an excursion down the Râșca River.Crohmălniceanu, p.197 With his subsequent pieces for Viața Românească, Sadoveanu became especially known as the raconteur of hunting trips,Călinescu, p.575-576 but also sparked controversy when a young woman writer, Constanța Marino-Moscu, accused him of having plagiarized her works in his Mariana Vidrașcu, a serialized novel which was discontinued and later largely forgotten. Bianca Burța-Cernat, \\" 'Cazul' Mariana Vidrașcu\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 1067, August 2010 1904 was Sadoveanu's effective debut year: he published four separate books, including Șoimii, Povestiri (\\"Stories\\"), Dureri înăbușite (\\"Suppressed Pains\\") and Crâșma lui Moș Petcu (\\"Old Man Petcu's Alehouse\\").

His Sămănătorul colleague Iorga deemed 1904 \\"Sadoveanu's Year\\", Radu Cernătescu, \\"Sadoveanu și francmasoneria\\" (with a note by Cornel Ungureanu), in Orizont, Nr. 6/2010 while the influential and aging critic Titu Maiorescu, leader of the conservative literary society Junimea, gave a positive review to Povestiri, and successfully proposed it for a Romanian Academy award in 1906.Ornea, Junimea și junimismul, p.50, 67, 71, 126, 127; Vianu, Vol.I, p.334-335, 337, 397-398; Vol.III, p.207 In a 1908 essay, Maiorescu was to list Sadoveanu among Romania's greatest writers.Ornea, Junimea și junimismul, p.157 According to Vianu, Maiorescu saw in Sadoveanu and other young writers the triumph of his theory on a \\"popular\\" form of Realism, a vision which the Junimist thinker had advocated in his essays from as early as 1882.Vianu, Vol.II, p.67; Vol.III, p.207-209 Sadoveanu later credited Iorga, Maiorescu, and especially so the cultural promoter Constantin Banu and Sămănătorul poet George Coșbuc, with having helped him capture the interest of the public and his peers. He was by then facing adversity from opponents of Sămănătorul, primarily critic Henric Sanielevici and his Curentul Nou review, which published claims that Sadoveanu's volumes, which depicted immoral acts such as adultery and rape, showed that Iorga's program of moral didacticism was hypocritical. As he latter recalled, Sadoveanu was himself upset with some of Iorga's critical judgments regarding his own work, noting that the Sămănătorist doyen had once declared him equal to Vasile Pop (one of Iorga's protegés, and viewed as overrated by Sadoveanu). The same year, Sadoveanu became one of Sămănătoruls editors, alongside Iorga and Iosif.Călinescu, p.601-602 The magazine, originally a traditionalist mouthpiece founded by Alexandru Vlahuță and George Coșbuc, proclaimed with Iorga its purpose of establishing \\"a national culture\\", emancipated from foreign influence.Călinescu, p.601 However, according to Călinescu, this ambitious goal was only manifested in a \\"great cultural influence\\", as the journal continued to be an eclectic venue which grouped together ruralist traditionalists of the \\"national tendency\\" and adherents to the cosmopolitan currents such as Symbolism.Călinescu, p.601-602, 974-975 Călinescu and Vianu agree that Sămănătorul was, for a large part, a promoter of older guidelines set by Junimea.Călinescu, p.602; Vianu, Vol.II, p.67-69 Vianu also argues that Sadoveanu's contribution to the literary circle was the main original artistic element in its history, and credits Iosif with having accurately predicted that, during a period of literary \\"crisis\\", Sadoveanu was the person to provide innovation.Vianu, Vol.III, p.209, 244 He continued to publish at an impressive rate: in 1906, he again handed down for print four separate volumes. In parallel, Sadoveanu pursued his career as a civil servant. In 1905, he was employed as a clerk by the Ministry of Education, headed by the Conservative Party's Mihail Vlădescu. His direct supervisor was poet D. Nanu, and he had for his colleagues the geographer George Vâlsan and the short story writer Nicolae N. Beldiceanu.Călinescu, p.646 Nanu wrote of this period: \\"It is a clerical packed full with men of letters, no work is being done, people smoke, drink coffee, create dreams, poems and prose [...].\\" Having interrupted his administrative service, Sadoveanu was again drafted into the Land Forces in 1906, being granted an officer's rank. An already overweight man, he had to march from Probota in Central Moldavia to Bukovina, which caused him intense suffering. =1910s and World War I= Title page of Neamul Șoimăreștilor in the original 1915 edition \\"with illustrations by Stoica\\" (Editura Minerva) Sadoveanu returned to his administrative job in 1907, the year of the Peasants' Revolt. Kept in office by the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. Brătianu, he served under the reform-minded Education Minister Spiru Haret. Constantin Coroiu, \\"Sadoveanu din spatele operei\\", in Evenimentul, January 14, 2006 Inspired by the bloody outcome of the Revolt, as well as by Haret's moves to educate the peasantry, Sadoveanu reportedly drew suspicion from the Police when he published self-help guides aimed at industrious ploughmen, a brand of social activism which even resulted in a formal inquiry.Crohmălniceanu, p.196-197 Mihail Sadoveanu became a professional writer in 1908–1909, after joining the Romanian Writers' Society, created in the previous year by poets Cincinat Pavelescu and Dimitrie Anghel, and becoming its President in September of that year.

Having reached the rank of Lieutenant, he was stationed in Fălticeni with the 15th Infantry Regiment, after which he spent a short period on the front. He returned to literary life. Becoming good friends with poet and humorist George Topîrceanu, he accompanied him and other writers on cultural tours during 1914 and 1915.Săndulescu, in Topîrceanu, Vol.I, p.XXI-XXII The series of writings he published at the time includes the 1915 Neamul Șoimăreștilor. In 1916–1917, as Romania entered World War I and was invaded by the Central Powers, Sadoveanu stayed in Moldavia, the only part of Romania's territory still under the state's authority (see Romanian Campaign). The writer oscillated between the Germanophilia of his Viața Românească friends, the stated belief that war was misery and the welcoming of Romania's commitment to the Entente Powers.Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\", p.104, 299-301, 306, 331-332, 362.

See also Crohmălniceanu, p.196. =Creative maturity and early political career= Agapia Monastery, one of Sadoveanu's favorite retreats In 1921, Sadoveanu was elected a full member of the Romanian Academy; he gave his reception speech in front of the cultural forum two years later, structuring it as a praise of Romanian folklore in general and folkloric poetry in particular.Cernat, p.144-145 At the time, he renewed his contacts with Viața Românească: with Garabet Ibrăileanu and several others, he joined its interwar nucleus, while the review often featured samples of his novels (some of which were originally published in full by its publishing venture).Crohmălniceanu, p.114, 137, 198, 582-583 His house was by then host to many cultural figures, among whom were writers Topîrceanu, Gala Galaction, Otilia Cazimir, Ionel and Păstorel Teodoreanu, and Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, as well as conductor Sergiu Celibidache. He was also close to a minor socialist poet and short story author, Ioan N. Roman, whose work he helped promote,Călinescu, p.598 to the aristocrat and memoirist Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești, Paul Cernat, \\"Senzaționalul unor amintiri de mare clasă\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 130, August 2002 and to a satirist named Radu Cosmin.Călinescu, p.727 Despite his health problems, Sadoveanu frequently traveled throughout Romania, notably visiting local sights which inspired his work: the Romanian Orthodox monasteries of Agapia and Văratec, and the Neamț Fortress. After 1923, together with Topîrceanu, Demostene Botez and other Viața Românească affiliates, he also embarked on a series of hunting trips. He was charmed in particular by the sights he discovered during a 1927 visit to the Transylvanian area of Arieș. The same year, he also visited the Netherlands, which he reached by means of the Orient Express. His popularity continued to grow: in 1925, 1929 and 1930 respectively, he published his critically acclaimed novels Venea o moară pe Siret..., Zodia Cancerului and Baltagul, and his 50th anniversary was celebrated at a national level. In 1930, Sadoveanu, Topîrceanu and the schoolteacher T. C. Stan wrote and edited a series of primary school textbooks.Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.562-563 (Săndulescu, in Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.703) In 1926, after a period of indecision, Sadoveanu rallied with the People's Party, where his friend, the poet Octavian Goga, was a prominent activist. He then rallied with Goga's own National Agrarian Party.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.28; Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.281 During the general election of 1927, he won a seat in the Chamber for Bihor County, in Transylvania, holding a seat in the Senate for Iași County after the 1931 suffrage.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.28 Under Nicolae Iorga's National Peasants' Party cabinet of the period, Sadoveanu was President of the Senate. The choice was motivated by his status as \\"a cultural personality\\". Around that date, he was affiliated with the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, a right-wing party inside the liberal current, who stood in opposition to the main National Liberal group. Victoria Gabriela Gruber, Partidul Național Liberal-Brătianu (rezumatul tezei de doctorat), Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, 2006, Chapter II In parallel, he began contributing to the left-wing daily Adevărul. Florentina Tone, \\"Scriitorii de la Adevĕrul\\", in Adevărul, December 30, 2008 Sadoveanu was by then affiliated with the Freemasonry, as first recorded by the organization in 1928,Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.23 but was probably a member since 1926 or 1927.Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.458 Reaching the 33rd degree within the organizationOrnea, Anii treizeci, p.459 and overseeing the Masonic Lodge Dimitrie Cantemir of Iași, he was elected Grand Master of the National Union of Lodges in 1932, thus replacing the vacating George Valentin Bibescu. There subsequently occurred a split between Bibescu and Sadoveanu's supporters, aggravated by their publicized conflict with a third group, that of Ioan Pangal—splits which ended after some three years, when Sadoveanu marginalized both of his opponents, without however earning legitimate recognition from the Grand Orient de France. By 1934, he was recognized as Grand Master of the United Romanian Freemasonry, which regrouped all major local Lodges. =Late 1930s and World War II= He was publishing new works at a regular rate, culminating in the first volume of his historical epic Frații Jderi, which saw print in 1935. In 1936, the writer accepted the honorary chairmanship of Adevărul and its morning edition, Dimineața. During that time, he was involved in a public dispute with the far right and fascist press, replying to their attacks in several columns.Crohmălniceanu, p.198; Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.435, 458-465 Affiliates of the radical right organized public burnings of his volumes.Crohmălniceanu, p.198; Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.460-461 The scandal prolonged itself over the following years, with Sadoveanu being supported by his friends in the literary community.Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.462-465; Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.561 Among them was Topîrceanu, who was at the time hospitalized, and whose expression of support was made shortly before his death to liver cancer.Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.560-562 (Săndulescu, in Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.582) In September 1937, as a statement of solidarity and appreciation, the University of Iași conferred Sadoveanu the title of doctor honoris causa.Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.464-465 Mihail Sadoveanu withdrew from politics in the late 1930s and early 1940s, as Romania came to be led by successive right-wing dictatorships, he offered a measure of support to King Carol II and his National Renaissance Front, which attempted to block the more radically fascist Iron Guard from power. He was personally appointed a member of the reduced corporatist Senate by Carol. Ion Simuț, \\"A fost sau n-a fost?\\", in România Literară, Nr. 7/2007 In 1940, the official establishment Editura Fundațiilor Regale published the first volume of his Opere (\\"Works\\"). Sadoveanu kept a low profile under the Iron Guard's Nazi-allied National Legionary regime. After Conducător Ion Antonescu overthrew the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion and established his own fascist regime, the still- apolitical Sadoveanu was more present in public life, and lectured on cultural subjects for the Romanian Radio. Valeriu Râpeanu, \\"Propagandă, manipulare, dar și cultură în adevăratul înțeles al cuvântului\\", in Curierul Național, February 28, 2004 After publishing the final section of his Frații Jderi in 1942, Sadoveanu again retreated to the countryside, in his beloved Arieș area, where he had built himself a chalet and a church; this seclusion produced his Povestirile de la Bradu-Strâmb (\\"Bradu-Strâmb Stories\\"). \\"Cabana lui Sadoveanu, rezervată polițiștilor\\", in România Liberă, January 30, 2008 During those years, the sixty-year-old writer met Valeria Mitru, a much younger feminist journalist, Bianca Burța, \\" 'Femeile între ele' în 1937\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr.290, October 2005 whom he married after a brief courtship. In August 1944, Romania's King Michael Coup toppled Antonescu and switched sides in the war, rallying with the Allies. As a Soviet occupation began at home, Romanian troops fought alongside the Red Army on the European theater. Paul-Mihu Sadoveanu was killed in action in Transylvania on September 22. During the same months, Sadoveanu was a candidate for the Writers' Society presidency, but, in what has been read as proof of a rivalry within the Freemasonry, was defeated by Victor Eftimiu. Later that year, the 40th anniversary of Mihail Sadoveanu's debut was celebrated with a special ceremony at the Academy and Tudor Vianu's speech, offered as a retrospective of his colleague's entire work.Vianu, Vol. III, p.205-230 =Communist system and political rise= Romanian Presidency in 1948. From left: Ștefan Voitec, Sadoveanu, Gheorghe Stere, Constantin Ion Parhon, Ion Niculi After the Soviet-backed advent of the Communist system in Romania, Sadoveanu supported the new authorities, and turned from his own version of Realism to officially- endorsed Socialist realism (see Socialist realism in Romania). This was also the start of his association with the Soviet-sponsored Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS), which was led by biologist and physician Constantin Ion Parhon. Having served as a host to official Soviet envoys Andrey Vyshinsky and Vladimir Kemenov during their late 1944 visits, he soon after became president of the ARLUS \\"Literary and Philosophical Section\\" (seconded by Mihai Ralea and Perpessicius).Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.121-123, 126-128, 145-146 In February 1945, he joined Parhon, Enescu, linguist Alexandru Rosetti, composer George Enescu, biologist Traian Săvulescu and mathematician Dimitrie Pompeiu in a protest against the cultural policies of Premier Nicolae Rădescu and his cabinet, one in a series of moves to discredit the non-communist Rădescu and make him leave power.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.285 With Ion Pas, Gala Galaction, Horia Deleanu, Octav Livezeanu and N. D. Cocea, Sadoveanu edited the association's weekly literary magazine Veac Nou after June 1946.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.25 Sadoveanu's literary and political change became known to the general public in March 1945, when he lectured about Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at a conference hall in Bucharest. Part of a conference cycle, his speech was famously titled Lumina vine de la Răsărit, which soon became synonymous with the attempts to improve the image of Stalinism in Romania.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.22-23; Frunză, p.189-190. See also Vasile, p.59-60, 244 ARLUS would issue the text of his conference as a printed volume later in the year. Also in 1945, Sadoveanu journeyed to the Soviet Union together with some of his fellow ARLUS members—among them biologists Parhon and Săvulescu, sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, linguist Iorgu Iordan, and mathematician Simion Stoilow.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.50 Invited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to attend the 220th anniversary of its foundation, they also visited research institutes, kolhozy, and day care centers, notably meeting with Nikolay Tsitsin, an agronomist favored by Stalin.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.50-51, 55-56 After his return, he wrote other controversial texts and gave lectures which offered ample praise to the Soviet system.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.23, 25, 34 That year, the ARLUS enterprise Editura Cartea Rusă also published his translation of Ivan Turgenev's A Sportsman's Sketches. During the rigged election of that year, Sadoveanu was a candidate for the Communist party-organized Bloc of Democratic Parties (BPD) in Bucharest, winning a seat in the newly unified Parliament of Romania.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.282, 289 Paula Mihailov Chiciuc, \\"Comunism - Iscusitele condeie din slujba 'democrației' \\" , in Jurnalul Național, July 17, 2007 In its first-ever session (December 1946), the legislative body elected him its President.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.282 He was at the time residing in Ciorogârla, having been awarded a villa previously owned by Pamfil Șeicaru, a journalist whose support for fascist regimes had made him undesirable, and who had moved out of Romania. The decision was viewed as evidence of political corruption by the opposition National Peasants' Party, whose press deemed Sadoveanu the \\"Count of Ciorogârla\\".Frunză, p.303 In 1948, after Romania's King Michael I was overthrown by the BPD-member parties and the communist regime officially established, Sadoveanu rose to the highest positions ever granted to a Romanian writer, and received significant material benefits.Frunză, p.374 In 1947–1948, he was, alongside Parhon, Ștefan Voitec, Gheorghe Stere, and Ion Niculi, a member of the Presidium of the People's Republic, which was elected by the BPD-dominated legislative.\\"Rural Life in Ruritania\\", in Time, June 22, 1962Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.283 He also kept his seat at the Academy, which at the time was undergoing a communist-led purge, and, with several other pro-Soviet intellectuals, was voted in the Academy Presidium.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.286-289 =Final years, illness and death= Photograph of the aging Sadoveanu After the Writers' Society was restructured as the Romanian Writers' Union in 1949, Sadoveanu became its Honorary President.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.283; Crohmălniceanu, p.199; Vasile, p.81-82 In 1950, he was named President of the Writers' Union, replacing Zaharia Stancu. According to writer Valeriu Râpeanu, this last appointment was a sign of Stancu's marginalization after he had been excluded from the Romanian Communist Party, while the Writers' Union was actually controlled by its First Secretary, the communist poet Mihai Beniuc. Valeriu Râpeanu, \\"Ce roman, viața lui Zaharia Stancu\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1998 Sadoveanu and Beniuc were reelected at the Union's first Congress (1956).Mihăilescu, 97-98 In the meanwhile, Sadoveanu published several Socialist realist volumes, among which was Mitrea Cocor, a controversial praise of collectivization policies. First published in 1949, it earned Sadoveanu the first-ever State Prize for Prose. Throughout the period, Sadoveanu was involved in major communist-endorsed cultural campaigns. Thus, in June 1952, he presided over the Academy's Scientific Council, charged with modifying the Romanian alphabet, at the end of which the letter â was discarded, and replaced everywhere with î (a spelling Sadoveanu is alleged to have already shown preference for in his early works).Selejan, p.116-117 In March 1953, soon after Stalin's death, he led discussions within the Writers' Union, confronting his fellow writers with the new Soviet cultural directives as listed by Georgy Malenkov, and reacting against young authors who had not discarded the since-condemned doctrines of proletkult.Selejan, p.147, 151-152, 156, 163-164 The author was also becoming involved in the Eastern Bloc's peace movement, and led the National Committee for the Defense of Peace at a time when the Soviet Union was seeking to portray its Cold War enemies as warmongers and the sole agents of nuclear proliferation. He also represented Romania to the World Peace Council, and received its International Peace Prize for 1951.Crohmălniceanu, p.199 As a parliamentarian, Sadoveanu stood on the committee charged with elaborating the new republican constitution, which, in its final form, reflected both Soviet influence and the assimilation of Stalinism into Romanian political discourse.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.135 In November 1955, shortly after turning 75, he was granted the title of \\"Hero of Socialist Labor\\".Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.283; Crohmălniceanu, p.199 After 1956, when the regime announced that it had embarked on a limited version of De-Stalinization, it continued to recommend Mihail Sadoveanu as one of its prime cultural models.Mihăilescu, p.97, 101 Having donated Casa cu turn to the state in 1950, he moved back to Bucharest, where he owned a house near the Zambaccian Museum. From January 7 to January 11, 1958, Sadoveanu, Ion Gheorghe Maurer and Anton Moisescu were acting Chairmen of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly, which again propelled him to a position as titular head of state. His literary stature but also his political allegiance earned him the Soviet Lenin Peace Prize, which he received shortly before his death.Cioroianu, p.283; Crohmălniceanu, p.199; Frunză, p.374 After a long illness marked by a stroke which impaired his speech and left him almost completely blind, Sadoveanu was cared for by a staff of physicians supervised by Nicolae Gh. Lupu and reporting to the Great National Assembly. The Sadoveanus withdrew to Neamț region, where they lived in a villa assigned to them by the state and located near the Voividenia hermitage and the locality of Vânători-Neamț, being visited regularly by literary and political friends, among them Alexandru Rosetti.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.284 Mihail Sadoveanu died there at 9 AM on October 19, 1961, and was buried at Bellu cemetery, in Bucharest. His successor as President of the Writers' Union was Beniuc, elected during the Congress of January 1962. Following her husband's death, Valeria Sadoveanu settled in proximity to the Văratec Monastery, where she set up an informal literary circle and Orthodox prayer group, notably attended by literary historian Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga and by poet Ștefana Velisar, and dedicated herself to protecting the community of nuns. \\"Revista presei\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr.167, May 2003 She survived Mihail Sadoveanu by over 30 years. Literary contributions =Context= Often seen as the leading author of his generation, and generally viewed as one of the most representative Romanian writers, Mihail Sadoveanu was also believed to be a first-class story-teller, and received praise especially for his nature writing and his depictions of rural landscapes. An exceptionally prolific author by Romanian standards, he published over a hundred individual volumesCornis-Pope, p.500; Crohmălniceanu, p.137, 192, 196-198, 582-584 \\" 'Ceahlăul literaturii române', sărbătorit la Chișinău\\", in Timpul, November 9, 2005 (120 according to the American magazine Time). His contemporaries tended to place Sadoveanu alongside Liviu Rebreanu and Cezar Petrescu—for all the differences in style between the three figures, the interwar public saw them as the \\"great novelists\\" of the day.Călinescu, p.766 Critic Ovid Crohmălniceanu describes their activity, altogether focused on depicting the rural world but diverging in bias, as one sign that the Romanian interwar itself was exceptionally effervescent,Crohmălniceanu, p.19, 189, 255, 262, 298 while Romanian-born American historian of literature Marcel Cornis-Pope sees Sadoveanu and Rebreanu as their country's \\"two most important novelists of the first half of the twentieth century\\".Cornis-Pope, p.447 In 1944, Tudor Vianu spoke of Sadoveanu as \\"the most significant writer Romanians [presently] have, the first among his equals.\\"Vianu, Vol.III, p.206 While underlining his originality in the context of Romanian literature and among the writers standing for \\"the national tendency\\" (as opposed to the more cosmopolitan modernists), George Călinescu also noted that, through several of his stories and novels, Sadoveanu echoed the style of his predecessors and contemporaries Ion Luca Caragiale, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești, Emil Gârleanu, Demostene Botez, Otilia Cazimir, Calistrat Hogaș, I. A. Bassarabescu and Ionel Teodoreanu.Călinescu, p.501, 575, 581, 617, 618, 620, 631, 672, 822, 835 Also included among the \\"national tendency\\" writers, Gârleanu was for long seen as Sadoveanu's counterpart, and even, Călinescu writes, \\"undeservedly upstaged\\" him.Călinescu, p.631 Cornis-Pope also writes that Sadoveanu's epic is a continuation of \\"the national narrative\\" explored earlier by Nicolae Filimon, Ioan Slavici and Duiliu Zamfirescu, while literary historians Vianu and Z. Ornea note that Sadoveanu also took inspiration from the themes and genres explored by Junimist author Nicolae Gane.Ornea, Junimea și junimismul, p.259; Vianu, Vol.II, p.115. According to Vianu, Sadoveanu \\"worshiped Gane as [his] maestro\\". In his youth, Sadoveanu also admired and collected the works of N. D. Popescu-Popnedea, a prolific and successful author of almanacs, historical novels and adventure novels. Later, his approach to Realism was also inspired by his reading of Gustave Flaubert and especially Nikolai Gogol. Both Sadoveanu and Gane were also indirectly influenced by Wilhelm von Kotzebue, the 19th century Imperial Russian diplomat and author of the Romanian-themed story Laskar Vioresku.Călinescu, p.452-453 In Vianu's assessment, Sadoveanu's work signified an artistic revolution within the local Realist school, comparable to the adoption of perspective by the visual artists of the Renaissance.Vianu, Vol.III, p.211-212 Mihail Sadoveanu's interest in the rural world and his views on tradition were subjects of debate among the modernists. The modernist doyen Eugen Lovinescu, who envisaged an urban literature in tune with European tendencies, was one of Sadoveanu's most notorious critics.Călinescu, p.803; Cernat, p.320; Crohmălniceanu, p.34-35, 39, 49 However, Sadoveanu was well received by Lovinescu's adversaries within the modernist camp: Perpessicius and Contimporanul editor Ion Vinea, the latter of whom, in search for literary authenticity, believed in bridging the gap between the avant-garde and folk culture.Cernat, p.143, 144-145, 320 This opinion was shared by Swedish literary historian Tom Sandqvist, who sees Sadoveanu's main point of contact with modernism was his interest in the pagan elements and occasional absurdist streaks of local folklore.Sandqvist, p.228, 248-249 In the larger dispute about national specificity, and partly in response to Vinea's claim, modernist poet and essayist Benjamin Fondane argued that, as a sign Romanian culture was tributary to those it had come into contact with, \\"Sadoveanu's soul can be easily reduced to the Slavic soul\\".Cernat, p.209 =Characteristics= Sadoveanu's personality and experience played a major part in shaping his literary style. After his 1901 marriage, Mihail Sadoveanu adopted what Călinescu deemed \\"patriarchal\\" lifestyle. The literary historian noted that he took a personal interest in educating his many children, and that this also implied \\"making use of a whip\\". An Epicurean, the writer was a homemaker, an avid hunter and fisherman, and a chess aficionado.Călinescu, p.615, 803; Vianu, Vol.II, p.115. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.198 Recognized, like his epigramist colleague Păstorel Teodoreanu, as a man of refined culinary tastes, Sadoveanu cherished Romanian cuisine and Romanian wine.Călinescu, p.778 The lifestyle choices were akin to his literary interests: alongside the secluded and rudimentary existence of his main characters (connected by Călinescu with the writer's supposed longing for \\"regressions to the patriarchal times\\"),Călinescu, p.622 Sadoveanu's work is noted for its imagery of primitive abundance, and in particular for its lavish depictions of ritualistic feasts, hunting parties and fishing trips.Călinescu, p.620, 621, 626, 627, 803; Crohmălniceanu, p.207-208, 229 Călinescu opined that the value of such descriptions within individual narratives grew with time, and that the author, once he had discarded lyricism, used them as \\"a means for the senses to enjoy the fleshes and the forms that nature offers man.\\"Călinescu, p.621 He added that Sadoveanu's aesthetics could be said to recall the art of the Golden Age in Holland: \\"One could almost say that Sadoveanu rebuilds in present day Moldavia [...] the Holland of wine jugs and kitchen tables covered in venison and fish.\\" Vianu also argued that Sadoveanu never abandoned himself to purely aesthetic descriptions, and that, although often depicted with Impressionistic means, nature is assigned a specific if discreet role within the plot lines, or serves to render a structure.Vianu, Vol.III, p.212-218, 248-249 The traditionalist Garabet Ibrăileanu, referring to Sadoveanu's poetic nature writing, even declared it to have \\"surpassed nature.\\"Crohmălniceanu, p.192 At the other end, the modernist Eugen Lovinescu specifically objected to Sadoveanu's depiction of a primordial landscape, arguing that, despite adopting Realism, his rival was indebted to Romanticism and subjectivity.Călinescu, p.803 Lovinescu's attitude, critic Ion Simuț notes, was partly justified by the fact that Sadoveanu never truly parted with the traditionalism of Sămănătorul. In 1962, Time also commented that his style was \\"curiously dated\\" and recalled not Sadoveanu's generation, but that of Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev, \\"although he has nothing like the power or skill of any of them.\\" For Călinescu and Vianu too, Sadoveanu is a creator with seemingly Romantic tastes, which recall those of François-René de Chateaubriand.Călinescu, p.631; Vianu, Vol.III, p.218. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.253 Unlike Lovinescu, Vianu saw these traits as \\"not at all detrimental to the balance of [Sadoveanu's] art.\\"Vianu, Vol.III, p.219 Seen by literary critic Ioan Stanomir as marked by \\"volubility\\",Stanomir, p.26 and thus contrasting with his famously taciturn and seemingly embittered nature,Crohmălniceanu, p.198; Vianu, Vol.III, p.230 the form of Romanian used by Mihail Sadoveanu, particularly in his historical novels, was noted for both its use of archaisms and the inventive approach to the Romanian lexis. Often borrowing plot lines and means of expression from medieval and early modern Moldavian chroniclers such as Ion Neculce and Miron Costin,Călinescu, p.625, 627, 628; Crohmălniceanu, p.225, 233, 239-240; Vianu, Vol.III, p.225-226 the author creatively intercalates several local dialects and registers of speech, moving away from a mere imitation of the historical language.Călinescu, p.627-628, 794, 914; Crohmălniceanu, p.228-229, 238-240, 253-254. Crohmălniceanu (p.239) notes that this \\"bewitching musical synthesis\\" of modern and ancient language is at times doubled by ironic pastiche. Generally third-person narratives, his books often make little or no dialectal difference between the speech used by the story-teller and the character's voices.Călinescu, p.627, 631; Vianu, Vol.III, p.225-226, 246-247; Crohmălniceanu, p.232, 239, 240, 254, 250-252 According to Călinescu, Sadoveanu displays \\"an enormous capacity of authentic speech\\", similar to that of Caragiale and Ion Creangă. The writer himself recorded his fascination with the \\"eloquence\\" of rudimentary orality, and in particular with the speech of Rudari Roma he encountered during his travels.Vianu, Vol.III, p.224-225 Building on observations made by several critics, who generally praised the poetic qualities of Sadoveanu's prose, Crohmălniceanu spoke in detail about the Moldavian novelist's role in reshaping the literary language.Crohmălniceanu, p.139, 192, 228-254 This particular contribution was first described early in the 20th century, when Sadoveanu was acclaimed by Titu Maiorescu for having adapted his writing style to the social environment and the circumstances of his narratives.Călinescu, p.413; Vianu, Vol.I, p.337; Vol.III, p.207 Vianu however notes that Sadoveanu's late writings tend to leave more room for neologisms, mostly present in those parts where the narrator's voice takes distance from the plot.Vianu, Vol.III, p.227, 236 Another unifying element in Sadoveanu's creation is his recourse to literary types. As early as 1904, Maiorescu praised the young raconteur for accurately depicting characters in everyday life and settings.Ornea, Junimea și junimismul, p.50; Vianu, Vol.III, p.207 Tudor Vianu stressed that, unlike most of his Realist predecessors, Sadoveanu introduced an overtly sympathetic view of the peasant character, as \\"a higher type of human, a heroic human\\".Vianu, Vol.III, p.220 He added: \\"Simple, in the sense that they are moved by a few devices [which] coincide with the fundamental instincts of mankind, [they] are, in general, mysterious.\\"Vianu, Vol.III, p.221 In this line, Sadoveanu also creates images of folk sages, whose views on life are of a Humanist nature, and often depicted in contrast with the rationalist tenets of Western culture.Vianu, Vol.III, p.251-252; Răileanu, p.16-17 Commenting on this aspect, Sadoveanu's friend George Topîrceanu believed that Sadoveanu's work transcended the \\"more intellectual [and] more artificial\\" notion of \\"types\\", and that \\"he creates [...] humans.\\"Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.337 The main topic of his subsequent work, Sandqvist argues, was \\"an archaic world where the farmers and the landlords were free men with equal rights\\"Sandqvist, p.252 (or, according to Simuț, \\"a utopia of archaic heroism\\"). Thus, Călinescu stresses, Sadoveanu's work seems to be the monolithic creation through which \\"a single man\\" reflects \\"a single, universal nature, inhabited by a single type of man\\", and which echoes a similar vision of archaic completeness as found in the literature of poet Mihai Eminescu. The similarity in vision with Eminescu's \\"nostalgia, return, protest, demand, aspiration toward a [rural] world [he has] left\\" was also proposed by Vianu,Vianu, Vol.II, p.213-214 while Topîrceanu spoke of \\"the paradoxical discovery that [Sadoveanu] is our greatest poet since Eminescu.\\"Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.336 Mihail Sadoveanu also shaped his traditionalist views on literature by investigating Romanian folklore, which he recommended as a source of inspiration to his fellow writers during his 1923 speech at the Romanian Academy. In Călinescu's view, Sadoveanu's outlook on life was even mirrored in his physical aspect, his \\"large body, voluminous head, his measured shepherd-like gestures, his affluent but prudent and monologic speech [and] feral indifference; his eyes [...] of an unknown race.\\" His assessment of the writer as an archaic figure, bluntly stated in a 1930 article (\\"I believe him to be very uncultured\\"), was contrasted by other literary historians: Alexandru Paleologu described Sadoveanu as a prominent intellectual figure, while his own private notes show that he was well-read and acquainted with the literatures of many countries. Often seen as a spontaneous writer, Sadoveanu nevertheless took pains to elaborate his plots and research historical context, keeping most records of his investigations confined to his diaries. =Debut= The writer's debut novel, Povestiri, was celebrated for its accomplished style, featuring early drafts of all themes he developed upon later in life. However, Călinescu argued, some of the stories in the volume were still \\"awkward\\", and showed that Sadoveanu had problems in outlining epics. The pieces mainly feature episodes in the lives of boyars (members of Moldavia's medieval aristocracy), showing the ways in which they relate to each other, to their servants, and to their country. In one of the stories, titled Cântecul de dragoste (\\"The Love Song\\"), Sadoveanu touches on the issue of slavery, depicting the death of a Rom slave who is killed by his jealous master, while in Răzbunarea lui Nour (\\"Nour's Revenge\\"), a boyar refuses to make his peace with God until his son's death is avenged. Other fragments deal solely with the isolated existence of villagers: for example, in Într-un sat odată (\\"Once, in a Village\\"), a mysterious man dies in a Moldavian hamlet, and the locals, unable to discover his identity, sell his horse.Călinescu, p.616 The prose piece Năluca (\\"The Apparition\\") centers on the conjugal conflict between two old people, both of whom attempt to hide the shame of their past. George Călinescu notes that, particularly in Năluca, Sadoveanu begins to explore the staple technique of his literary contributions, which involves \\"suggesting the smolder of passions [through] a contemplative breath in which he evokes a static element: landscapes or set pieces from nature.\\" Sadoveanu's subsequent collection of short stories, Dureri înăbușite, builds on the latter technique and takes his work into the realm of social realism and naturalism (believed by Călinescu to have been borrowed from either the French writer Émile Zola or from the Romanian Alexandru Vlahuță).Călinescu, p.616, 803 For Călinescu, this choice of style brought \\"damaging effects\\" on Sadoveanu's writings, and made Dureri înăbușite \\"perhaps the poorest\\" of his collections of stories. In Lovinescu's view, Sadoveanu's move toward naturalism did not imply the necessary recourse to objectivity. The pieces focus on dramatic moments of individual existences. In Lupul (\\"The Wolf\\"), an animal is chased and trapped by a group of peasants; the eponymous character in Ion Ursu leaves his village to become a proletarian, and succumbs to alcoholism;Călinescu, p.616; Crohmălniceanu, p.202; Vianu, Vol.III, p.222-223 the indentured laborer in Sluga (\\"The Servant\\") is unable to take revenge on his cruel employer at the right moment; in Doi feciori (\\"Two Sons\\"), a boyar comes to feel affection for his illegitimate son, whom he has nonetheless reduced to a lowly condition. In 1905, Sadoveanu also published Povestiri din război (\\"Stories from the War\\"), which compose scenes from the lives of Romanian soldiers fighting in the War of 1878. Objecting to a series of exaggerations in the book, Time nevertheless noted that Sadoveanu \\"sometimes had the writing skill to make compelling even quite traditional reactions to old-fashioned war\\". It concluded: \\"Sadoveanu's sketches have the virtues—and the vices—of old hunting prints and the romantically mannered battle scenes of the 19th century.\\" =Early selections of major themes= Moldova Valley, setting of Sadoveanu's Crâșma lui Moș Petcu Sadoveanu renounces this grim perspective on life in his volume Crâșma lui Moș Petcu, where he returns to a depiction of rural life as unchanged by outside factors. Petcu's establishment, located on the Moldova Valley, is a serene place, visited by quiet and subdued customers, whose occasional outburst of violence are, according to Călinescu, \\"dominated by slow, stereotypical mechanics, as is with people who can only accommodate within them a single drama.\\" The literary critic celebrated Crâșma lui Moș Petcu for its depictions of nature, whose purpose is to evoke \\"the indifferent eternity\\" of conflicts between the protagonists, and who, at times, relies \\"on a vast richness of sounds and words.\\"Călinescu, p.617 He did however reproach the writer \\"a certain monotony\\", arguing that Sadoveanu came to use such techniques in virtually all his later works. However, Sadoveanu's stories of the period often returned to a naturalistic perspective, particularly in a series of sketch stories and novellas which portray the modest lives of Romanian Railways employees, of young men drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, of Bovaryist women who playfully seduce adolescents, or of the provincial petite bourgeoisie.Călinescu, p.617-618, 620-621. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.195, 196, 201-203, 213-224. At times, they confront the morals of barely literate people with the stern authorities: a peasant obstinately believes that the 1859 union between Wallachia and Moldavia was meant to ensure the supremacy of his class; a young lower-class woman becomes the love interest of a boyar but chooses a life of freedom; and a Rom deserts from the Army after being told to bathe.Călinescu, p.618-619, 620 In La noi, la Viișoara (\\"At Our Place in Viișoara\\"), the life of an old man degenerates into bigotry and avarice, to the point where he makes his wife starve to death.Călinescu, p.618 Sadoveanu's positive portrayal of hajduks as fundamentally honest outlaws standing up to feudal injustice, replicates stereotypes found in Romanian folklore, and is mostly present in some of the stories through (sometimes recurrent) heroic characters: Vasile the Great, Cozma Răcoare, Liță Florea etc.Crohmălniceanu, p.203-204, 209-210, 225, 226-227, 243, 247-248 In the piece titled Bordeenii (roughly, \\"The Mud-hut Dwellers\\"), he shows eccentrics and misanthropes presided upon by the dark figure of Sandu Faliboga, brigands who flee all public authority and whom commentators have likened to settlers of the Americas.Călinescu, p.619; Crohmălniceanu, p.201 Lepădatu, an unwanted child, speaks for the entire group: \\"What could I do [...] wherever there are big fairs and lots of people? I'd have a better time with the cattle; it is with them that I have grown up and with them that I get along.\\"Călinescu, p.619 Romanticizing the obscure events of early medieval history in Vremuri de bejenie (\\"Roving Times\\", 1907), Sadoveanu sketches the improvised self-defense of a refugee community, their last stand against nomadic Tatars.Crohmălniceanu, p.225, 234, 247 In reference to the stories in this series, Călinescu stresses that Sadoveanu's main interest is in depicting men and women cut away from civilization, who view the elements of Westernization with nothing more than \\"wonderment\\": \\"Sadoveanu's literature is the highest expression of the savage instinct.\\"Călinescu, p.620 In later works, the critic believed, Sadoveanu moved away from depicting isolation as the escape of primitives into their manageable world, but as \\"the refinement of souls whom civilization has upset.\\" These views are echoed by Ovid Crohmălniceanu, who believes that, unlike other Romanian Realists, Sadoveanu was able to show a peasant society that was not merely the prey of modern corruption or historical oppression, but rather refusing all contacts with the wider world—even to the point of Luddite-like hostility in front of new objects.Crohmălniceanu, p.199-212, 248-253, 540 Some of the early stories, Crohmălniceanu argues, do follow the moralizing Sămănătorist pattern, but part with it when they refuse to present the countryside in \\"idyllic\\" fashion, or when they adopt a specific \\"mythical realism\\".Crohmălniceanu, p.195-196 Sadoveanu began his career as a novelist with more in-depth explorations into subjects present in his stories and novellas. At the time, Crohmălniceanu stresses, he was being influenced by the naturalism of Caragiale (minus the comedic effect), and by his own experience growing up in characteristically underdeveloped Moldavian cities and târguri (somewhat similar to the aesthetic of boredom, adopted in poetry by George Bacovia, Demostene Botez or Benjamin Fondane).Crohmălniceanu, p.213-215, 223-224 Among his first works of the kind is Floare ofilită (\\"Wizened Flower\\"), where a simple girl, Tincuța, marries a provincial civil servant, and finds herself deeply unhappy and unable to enrich her life on any level. Tincuța, seen by Călinescu as one of Sadoveanu's \\"savage\\" characters, only maintains urban refinement when persuading her husband to return for supper, but, according to Crohmălniceanu, is also a credible witness to the \\"small- mindedness\\" of \\"bourgeois\\" environments.Crohmălniceanu, p.214-215 A rather similar plot is built for Însemnările lui Neculai Manea (\\"The Recordings of Neculai Manea\\"), where the eponymous character, an educated peasant, experiences two unhappy romantic affairs before successfully courting a married woman who, although grossly uncultured, makes him happy. Apa morților (\\"The Dead Men's Water\\") is about a Bovaryist woman who discards lovers over imprecise feelings of dissatisfaction, finding refuge in the monotonous countryside.Călinescu, p.620-621; Crohmălniceanu, p.215, 216, 219 Călinescu noted that such novels were \\"usually less valuable than direct accounts\\", and deemed Însemnările lui Neculai Manea \\"without literary interest\\"; in Ovid Crohmălniceanu's view, the same story presents relevant detail on professional and intellectual failure.Crohmălniceanu, p.218-219, 224, 447 Praised by its commentators, the short novel Haia Sanis (1908) shows the eponymous character, a Jewish woman who throws herself into the arms of a local Gentile, although she knows him to be a seducer. Călinescu, who wrote with admiration about how the subject dissimulated pathos into \\"technical indifference\\", notes that the erotic rage motivating Haia has drawn \\"well justified\\" comparisons with Jean Racine's tragedy Phèdre.Călinescu, p.630 Crohmălniceanu believes Haia Sanis to be \\"perhaps [Sadoveanu's] best novella\\", particularly since the \\"wild beauty\\" Haia has to overcome at once antisemitism, endogamy and shame, before dying \\"in terrible pain\\" during a botched abortion.Crohmălniceanu, p.219-221 Sadoveanu's work of the time also includes Balta liniștii (\\"Tranquillity Pond\\"), where Alexandrina, pushed into an arranged marriage, has a belated and sad revelation of true love.Crohmălniceanu, p.216-218, 219 In other sketch stories, such as O zi ca altele (\\"A Day like Any Other\\") or Câinele (\\"The Dog\\"), Sadoveanu follows Caragiale's close study of suburban banality.Crohmălniceanu, p.221-224 =Hanu Ancuței, Șoimii and Neamul Șoimăreștilor= Return of the Cossacks by 19th century Polish painter Józef Brandt, taking its inspiration from 17th century Cossack raids The novella Hanu Ancuței (\\"Ancuța's Inn\\"), described by George Călinescu as a \\"masterpiece of the jovial idyllicism and barbarian subtlety\\", and by Z. Ornea as the first evidence of Sadoveanu's \\"new age\\",Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.16, 458-459 is a frame story in the line of medieval allegories such as Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron and Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.Călinescu, p.622; Vianu, Vol.I, p.25 It retells the stories of travelers meeting in the eponymous inn. Much of the story deals with statements of culinary tastes and shared recipes, as well as with the overall contrast between civilization and rudimentary ways: in one episode of the book, a merchant arriving from the Leipzig Trade Fair bemuses the other protagonists when he explains the more frugal ways and the technical innovations of Western Europe.Călinescu, p.622; Crohmălniceanu, p.208, 240; Răileanu, p.11 Sadoveanu applied the same narrative technique in his Soarele în baltă (\\"The Sun in the Waterhole\\"), which, Călinescu argues, displays \\"a trickier style.\\" In Șoimii, Sadoveanu's first historical novel, the main character is Nicoară Potcoavă, a late 16th-century Moldavian nobleman who became Hetman of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and Prince of Moldavia. The narrative, whose basic lines had been drawn by Sadoveanu in his adolescent years,Răileanu, p.5 focuses on early events in Nicoară's life, building on the story according to which he and his brother Alexandru were the brothers of Prince Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit, whose execution by the Ottomans they tried to avenge. The text also follows their attempt to seize and kill Ieremia Golia, a boyar whose alleged betrayal had led to Prince Ioan's capture, and whose daughter Ilinca becomes the brothers' prisoner. This story as well features several episodes where the focus is on depicting customary feasts, as well as a fragment where the Potcoavăs and their Zaporozhian Cossack allies engage in binge drinking. Glossing over several years in Nicoară's life, and culminating in his seizure of the throne, the narrative shows his victory against pretender Petru Șchiopul and Golia, and the price he has to pay for his rise. Alexandru, who falls in love with Ilinca, unsuccessfully asks for the captured Golia not to be killed. Following the murder, both brothers become embittered and renounce power.Călinescu, p.623 Călinescu described Șoimii novel as \\"still awkward\\", noting that Sadoveanu was only beginning to experiment with the genre. View from the area around Orhei, where much of Neamul Șoimăreștilor takes place The 1915 Neamul Șoimăreștilor is a Bildungsroman centered on the coming of age of one Tudor Șoimaru. The protagonist, born a free peasant in Orhei area, fights alongside Ștefan Tomșa in the 1612 battles to capture the Moldavian throne. After participating in the capture of Iași, he returns home and helps local boyar Stroie in recovering his daughter, Magda, who had been kidnapped by Cossacks. Șoimaru, who feels for Magda, is however enraged by news that her father has forced his community into serfdom. Trying to deal with his internal conflict, he travels into Poland–Lithuania, where he discovers that Stroie is plotting against Tomșa, while Magda, who is in love with a szlachta nobleman, scorns his affection. He returns a second time to Orhei, marries into his social group, and plots revenge on Stroie by again rallying with Ștefan Tomșa. Following Tomșa's defeat, he again loses the lands of his ancestors, as Stroie returns home to celebrate his victory and have the Șoimarus put to death. Unexpectedly warned of this by Magda, Tudor manages to turn the tide: he and his family destroy Stroie's manor, killing the master but allowing Magda to escape unharmed.Călinescu, p.623; Crohmălniceanu, p.230, 231-232 In Călinescu's view, the novel is \\"somewhat more consistent from an epic perspective\\", but fails to respect the conventions of the adventure novel it sets out to replicate. The critic, who deemed Magda's courtship by Tudor \\"sentimental\\", argued that the book lacks \\"the richness and unpredictable nature of the love intrigue\\"; he also objected to the depiction of Tudor as indecisive and inadequate for a heroic role. However, Ovid Crohmălniceanu argued that the suddenness of Tudor's sentimental commitments was characteristic for the \\"peasant soul\\" as observed by Sadoveanu.Crohmălniceanu, p.205-206, 208 =Zodia Cancerului and Nunta Domniței Ruxandra= Zodia Cancerului, Sadoveanu's later historical novel, is set late in the 17th century, during the third rule of Moldavian Prince Gheorghe Duca, and is seen by Călinescu as \\"of a superior artistic level.\\" The plot centers on a conflict between Duca and the Ruset boyars: the young Alecu Ruset, son of the deposed Prince Antonie, is spared persecution on account of his good relations with the Ottomans, but has to live under close watch. Himself a tormented, if cultured and refined, man, Alecu falls in love with Duca's daughter Catrina, whom he attempts to kidnap. The episode, set to coincide with the start of a major social crisis,Crohmălniceanu, p.225-226, 229, 232, 233 ends with Alecu's defeat and killing on Duca's orders.Călinescu, p.623-624; Răileanu, p.13 In the background, the story depicts the visit of an Abbé de Marenne, a Roman Catholic priest and French envoy, who meets and befriends Ruset. Their encounter is another opportunity for Sadoveanu to show the amiable but incomplete exchange between the mentalities of Western and Eastern Europe.Călinescu, p.624; Crohmălniceanu, p.229, 230 In various episodes of the novel, de Marenne shows himself perplexed by the omnipresent wilderness of underpopulated Moldavia, and in particular by the abundance of resources this provides.Călinescu, p.624 In one paragraph, seen by George Călinescu as a key to the book, Sadoveanu writes: \\"[De Marenne's] curious eye was permanently satisfied. Here was a desolation of solitudes, one that his friends in France could not even guess existed, no matter how much imagination they had been gifted with; for at the antipode of civilization one occasionally finds such things that have remained unchanged from the onset of creation, preserving their mysterious beauty.\\" In a shorter novel of the period, Sadoveanu explored the late years of Vasile Lupu's rule over Moldavia, centering on the marriage of Cossack leader Tymofiy Khmelnytsky and Lupu's daughter, Ruxandra. Titled Nunta Domniței Ruxandra (\\"Princess Ruxandra's Wedding\\"), it shows the Cossacks' brutal celebration of the event around the court in Iași, depicting Tymofiy himself as an uncouth, violent and withdrawn figure.Călinescu, p.625 The narrative then focuses on the Battle of Finta and the siege of Suceava, through which a Wallachian-Transylvanian force repelled the Moldo-Cossack forces and, turning the tide, entered deep into Moldavia and placed Gheorghe Ștefan on the throne. Sadoveanu also invents a love story between Ruxandra and the boyar Bogdan, whose rivalry with Tymofiy ends in the latter's killing. While Călinescu criticized the plot as being over-detailed, and the character studies as incomplete, Crohmălniceanu found the intricate depiction of boyar customs to be a relevant part of Sadoveanu's \\"vast historical fresco.\\"Crohmălniceanu, p.229 In both Zodia Cancerului and Nunta Domniței Ruxandra, the author took significant liberties with the historical facts. In addition to Tymofiy's death at the hands of Bogdan, the latter narrative used invented or incorrect names for some of the personages, and portrays the muscular, mustachioed, Gheorghe Ștefan as thin and bearded; likewise, in Zodia Cancerului, Sadoveanu invents the character Guido Celesti, who stands in for the actual Franciscan leader of Duca's Iași, Bariona da Monte Rotondo. =Frații Jderi, Venea o moară pe Siret... and Baltagul= Stephen the Great in a Voroneț Monastery mural With Frații Jderi, Sadoveanu's fresco of Moldavian history maintains its setting, but moves back in time to the 15th century rule of Prince Stephen the Great. Writing in 1941, before its final part was in print, Călinescu argued that the novel was part of Sadoveanu's \\"most valuable work\\", and noted \\"the maturity of its verbal means.\\"Călinescu, p.627. Although it went through several editions after that date, and was partly revised to cover events in Sadoveanu's later career, Călinescu's book does not include an analysis of the final volume. In the first volume, titled Ucenicia lui Ionuț (\\"Ionuț's Apprenticeship\\"), the eponymous Jderi brothers, allies of Stephen and friends of his son Alexandru, fight off the enemies of their lord on several occasions. In what is the start of a Bildungsroman, the youngest Jder, Ionuț Păr-Negru, consumed by love for Lady Nasta, who was kidnapped by Tatars. He goes to her rescue, only to find out that she had preferred suicide to a life of slavery.Călinescu, p.626; Crohmălniceanu, p.235-238 Călinescu, who believed the volumes show Sadoveanu's move to the consecrated elements of adventure novels, called them \\"remarkable\\", but stressed that the narrative could render \\"the feeling of stumbling, of a languishing flow\\", and that the dénouement was \\"rather depressing\\".Călinescu, p.626 The second book in the series (Izvorul alb, \\"The White Water Spring\\") intertwines the life of the Jderi brothers with that of Stephen's family: the ruler weds the Byzantine princess Mary of Mangop, while Simion Jder falls for Marușca, who is supposedly Stephen's illegitimate daughter. The major episodes in the narrative are Marușca's kidnapping by a boyar, her captivity in Jagiellon Poland, and her rescue at the hands of the Jderi.Călinescu, p.626-627 The 1942 conclusion of the cycle, Oamenii Măriei-sale (\\"His Lordship's Men\\"), the brothers are shown defending their ancestral rights and their lord against the Ottoman invader and ambivalent boyars, and crushing the former at the Battle of Vaslui.Crohmălniceanu, p.228, 230-231, 233-234, 238, 247 The Jderi books, again set to the background of primitivism and natural abundance, also feature episodes of intense horror. These, Călinescu proposes, are willingly depicted \\"with an indolent complacency\\", as if to underline that the slow pace and monumental scale of history give little importance to personal tragedies. The same commentator notes a difference between the role nature plays in the first and second volumes: from serene, the landscape becomes hostile, and people are shown fearing earthquakes and droughts, although contemplative depictions of euphoria play a central part in both writings. The meeting between the wider world and the immobile local tradition surfaces in Frații Jderi as well: a messenger is shown wondering how the letter he brought could talk to the addressee; when she is supposed to encounter strange men, Marușca requests to be allowed to \\"shy away\\" in another room;Călinescu, p.627 a secondary character, claiming precognition, prepares his own funeral.Crohmălniceanu, p.207 For the 1925 Venea o moară pe Siret..., Sadoveanu received much critical acclaim. The boyar Alexandru Filotti falls in love with a miller's daughter, Anuța, whom he educates and introduces to high society. The beautiful young lady is also courted by Filotti's son Costi and by the peasant Vasile Brebu—in the end, overwhelmed by jealousy, Brebu kills the object of his affection. George Călinescu writes that the good reception was not fully deserved, claiming that the novel is \\"colorless\\", that it was merely based on the writer's early stories, and that it failed in its goal of depicting \\"crumbling boyardom\\". In Baltagul (1930), Sadoveanu merged psychological techniques and a pretext borrowed from crime fiction with several of his major themes.Călinescu, p.629; Crohmălniceanu, p.204-205 Written in just 30 days on the basis of previous drafts, the condensed novel shows Vitoria Lipan, the widow of a murdered shepherd, following in her husband's tracks to discover his killer and avenge his death. Accompanied by her son, and using for a guide the shepherd's dog, Vitoria discovers both the body and the murderer, but, before she can take revenge, her dog jumps on the man and bites into his neck. By means of this plot line, Sadoveanu also builds a fresco of transhumance and traces its ancestral paths, taking as a source of inspiration one of the best-known poems in local folklore, the ballad Miorița.Călinescu, p.629; Crohmălniceanu, p.205 Vitoria's sheer determination is the central aspect of the volume. Călinescu, who ranks the book among Sadoveanu's best, praises its \\"remarkable artistry\\" and \\"unforgettable dialogues\\", but nonetheless writes that Lipan's \\"detective-like\\" search and a \\"stubbornness\\" are weak points in the narrative.Călinescu, p.629 Crohmălniceanu declares Baltagul one of the \\"capital works\\" in world literature, proposing that, on its own, it manages to reconstruct \\"an entire shepherding civilization\\";Crohmălniceanu, p.205 Cornis-Pope, who rates the book as \\"Sadoveanu's masterpiece\\", also notes that it \\"restated the theme of crime and punishment\\". =Main travel writings and memoirs= Before the 1940s, Sadoveanu also became known as a travel writer. His contributions notably include accounts of his hunting trips: Țara de dincolo de negură (\\"The Land beyond the Fog\\"), and one dedicated to the region of Dobruja (Priveliști dobrogene, \\"Dobrujan Sights\\"). Călinescu wrote that they both comprised \\"pages of great beauty\\". Țara de dincolo..., primarily showing recluse men in real- life symbiosis with the wilderness,Crohmălniceanu, p.206 also attention for its sympathetic depiction of the Hutsuls, a minority Slavic-speaking population, as an ancient tribe threatened by cultural assimilation.Marian Chiselițe, \\"Huțulii din Bucovina\\", in National Geographic Romanian edition, August 2009, p.56 Sadoveanu's other travelogues include the reportage Oameni și locuri (\\"People and Places\\") and an account of his trips into Bessarabia (Drumuri basarabene, \\"Bessarabian Roads\\"). He also collected and commented upon the memoirs of other avid hunters (Istorisiri de vânătoare, \\"Hunting Stories\\"). A noted writing in this series was Împărăția apelor (\\"The Realm of Waters\\"). It forms a detailed and contemplative memoir of his journeys as a fisherman, and, according to Crohmălniceanu, one of the most eloquent proofs of Sadoveanu's \\"permanent and intimate correspondence with nature.\\"Crohmălniceanu, p.244-245 Călinescu saw the text as a \\"fantastic vision of the entire aquatic universe\\", merging a form of pessimism similar to Arthur Schopenhauer's with a \\"calm kief\\" (cannabis-induced torpor), and as such illustrating \\"the great joy of participating in the transformations of matter, of eating and allowing oneself to be eaten.\\" Sadoveanu also contributed an account of his travels into the Netherlands, Olanda (\\"Holland\\"). It provides insight into his preoccupation with the meeting of civilization and wilderness: upset by what he called \\"the [Dutch] rampancy of cleanliness\\", the writer confesses his perplexity at coming face to face with a contained and structured natural world, and details his own temptation to go \\"against the current\\".Călinescu, p.628 One of Sadoveanu's main conclusions is that Holland lacks in \\"true and lively wonders\\". Sadoveanu also sporadically wrote memoirs of his early life career, such as Însemnări ieșene (\\"Recordings from Iași\\"), which deals with the period during which he worked for Viața Românească,Călinescu, p.661 a book about the Second Balkan War (44 de zile în Bulgaria, \\"44 Days in Bulgaria\\"),Călinescu, p.830; Crohmălniceanu, p.197 and the account of years in primary school, Domnu Trandafir. They were followed in 1944 by Anii de ucenicie (\\"The Apprenticeship Years\\"), where Sadoveanu details some of his earliest experiences.Crohmălniceanu, p.193, 213-214 Despite his temptation for destroying all raw personal notes, Sadoveanu wrote and kept a large number of diaries, which were never published in his lifetime. =Other early writings= Also during that time, he retold and prefaced the journeys of Thomas Witlam Atkinson, an English architect and stonemason who spent years in Tartary (a book he titled Cuibul invaziilor, \\"The Nest of Invasions\\"). This was evidence of his growing interest in exotic subjects, which he later adapted to a series of novels, where the setting is \\"Scythia\\", seen as an ancestral area of culture connecting Central Asia with the European region of Dacia (partly coinciding with present-day Romania).Călinescu, p.628-629 The home of mysterious Asiatic peoples, Sadoveanu's Scythia is notably the background to his novels Uvar and Nopțile de Sânziene. The former shows its eponymous character, a Yakut, exposed to the scrutiny of a Russian officer. In the latter, titled after the ancestral celebration of Sânziene during the month of June, shows a French intellectual meeting a nomadic tribe of Moldavian Rom people, who, the reader learns, are actually the descendants of Pechenegs. Călinescu notes that, in such writings, \\"the intrigue is a pretext\\", again serving to depict the vast wilderness confronted with the keen eye of foreign observers. He sees Nopțile de Sânziene as \\"the novel of millenarian immobility\\", and its theme as one of mythological proportions. The narrative pretexts, including the Sânziene celebration and the Rom people's social atavism, connect Nopțile... with another one of Sadoveanu's writings, 24 iunie (\\"June 24\\").Crohmălniceanu, p.203, 204, 242, 245-246, 247-248, 249 According to Tudor Vianu, the 1933 fantasy novel Creanga de aur (\\"The Golden Bow\\") takes partial inspiration from Byzantine literature, and is evidence of a form of Humanism found in Eastern philosophy.Vianu, Vol.III, p.227 Marcel Cornis-Pope places it among Sadoveanu's \\"mythic-poetic narratives that explored the ontology and symbolics of history.\\"Cornis-Pope, p.500 The writer himself acknowledged that the esoteric nature of the book was inspired by his own affiliation to the Freemasonry, whose symbolism it partly reflected. Its protagonist, Kesarion Brebu, is included by Vianu among the images of sages and soothsayers in Mihail Sadoveanu's fiction,Vianu, Vol.III, p.253 and, as \\"the last Deceneus\\", is a treasurer of ancient secret sciences mastered by the Dacians and the Ancient Egyptians.Răileanu, p.14 The novel is often interpreted as Sadoveanu's perspective on the Dacian contribution to Romanian culture.Cornis-Pope, p.500-501 Sadoveanu's series of minor novels and stories of the interwar years also comprises a set of usually urban-themed writings, which, Călinescu argues, resemble the works of Honoré de Balzac, but develop into \\"regressive\\" texts with \\"a lyrical intrigue\\". They include Duduia Margareta (\\"Miss Margareta\\"), where a conflict occurs between a young woman and her governess, and Locul unde nu s-a întâmplat nimic (\\"The Place Where Nothing Happened\\"), where, in what is a retake on his own Apa morților,Călinescu, p.629; Crohmălniceanu, p.215; Răileanu, p.5-6 Sadoveanu depicts the cultured but bored boyar Lai Cantacuzin and his growing affection for a modest young woman, Daria Mazu.Călinescu, p.629-630; Crohmălniceanu, p.215-216 In Cazul Eugeniței Costea (\\"The Case of Eugenița Costea\\"), a civil servant kills himself to avoid prosecution, and his end is replicated by that of his daughter, brought to despair by her stepfather's character and by her mother's irrational jealousy.Călinescu, p.630-631 Demonul tinereții (\\"The Demon of Youth\\"), believed by Călinescu to be \\"the most charming\\" in this series, has for its protagonist Natanail, a university dropout who has developed a morbid fear of women since losing the love of his life, and who lives in seclusion as a monk. In the rural-themed Paștele blajinilor (\\"Thomas Sunday\\") of 1935, a defeated brigand seeks a dignified end to his wasted life.Crohmălniceanu, p.203, 209-210, 227 Written in 1938, the short story Ochi de urs (\\"Bear's Eye\\") introduces its hero Culi Ursake, the toughened hunter, into a bizarre scenery that seems to mock a human's understanding.Crohmălniceanu, p.204, 241 During the period, Mihail Sadoveanu also wrote children's literature. His most significant pieces in this field are Dumbrava minunată (\\"The Enchanted Grove\\", 1926), Măria-sa Puiul Pădurii (\\"His Highness the Forest Boy\\", 1931), and a collection of stories adapted from Persian literature (Divanul persian, \\"The Persian Divan\\", 1940). Măria-sa Puiul Pădurii is itself an adaptation of the Geneviève de Brabant story, considered \\"somewhat highbrow\\" by George Călinescu, while the frame story Divanul persian consciously recalls the work of 19th century Wallachian writer Anton Pann.Vianu, Vol.I, p.12 In 1909, Sadoveanu also published adapted version of two ancient writings: the Alexander Romance (as Alexandria) and Aesop's Fables (as Esopia).Răileanu, p.7 His 1921 book Cocostârcul albastru (\\"The Blue Crane\\") is a series of short stories with lyrical themes.Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.336-338 Among his early writings are two biographical novels which retell historical events from the source, Viața lui Ștefan cel Mare (\\"The Life of Stephen the Great\\") and Lacrimile ieromonahului Veniamin (\\"The Tears of Veniamin the Hieromonk\\"), both of which, Călinescu objected, lacked in originality. The former, published in 1934, was more noted among critics, for both intimate tone and hagiographic character (recounting Stephen's life on the model of saints' biographies). =Socialist realism years= Despite the post-1944 change in approach, Sadoveanu's characteristic narrative style remained largely unmodified.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.34; Pe umerii lui Marx, p.282; Stanomir, p.26 In contrast, his choice of themes changed, a transition which reflected political imperatives. At the end of the process, literary historian Ana Selejan argues, Sadoveanu became the most influential prose author among Romanian Socialist realists, equaled only by the younger Petru Dumitriu.Selejan, p.211 Historian Bogdan Ivașcu writes that Sadoveanu's affiliation with \\"proletarian culture\\" and \\"its masquerade\\", like that of Tudor Arghezi and George Călinescu, although it may have been intended to rally \\"prestige and depth\\" to Socialist realism, only succeeded in bring their late works to the level of \\"propaganda and agitation materials.\\"Bogdan Ivașcu, \\"Mimetismul totalitar\\", in Idei în Dialog, Vol. IV, Nr. 9 (48), September 2008, p.39 In contrast to these retrospective assessments, communist literary critics and cultural promoters of the 1950s regularly described Sadoveanu as the model to follow, both before and after Georgy Malenkov's views on culture were adopted as the norm.Selejan, p.21, 93, 95, 152, 172, 175, 331-332, 347 In his Lumina vine de la Răsărit, the writer built on the opposition between light and darkness, identifying the former with Soviet policies and the latter with capitalism. Sadoveanu thus spoke of \\"the dragon of my own doubts\\" being vanquished by \\"the Sun of the East\\".Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.27; Stanomir, p.24 Historian Adrian Cioroianu notes that this literary antithesis came to be widely used by various Romanian authors who rallied with Stalinism during the late 1940s, citing among these Cezar Petrescu and the former avant-garde writer Sașa Pană.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.26-27 He also notes that such imagery, accompanied by portrayals of Soviet joy and abundance, replicated an ancient \\"structure of myth\\", adapting it to a new ideology on the basis of \\"what could be imagined, not of what could be believed.\\"Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.62-63 Ioan Stanomir writes that Sadoveanu and his fellow ARLUS members use a discourse recalling the theme of a religious conversion, analogous to that of Paul the Apostle (see Road to Damascus),Stanomir, p.25 and critic Cornel Ungureanu stresses that Sadoveanu's texts of the period frequently quote the Bible. Following his return from the Soviet Union, Sadoveanu published travelogues and reportage piece, including the 1945 Moscova (\\"Moscow\\", co-authored with Traian Săvulescu and economist Mitiță Constantinescu) and the 1946 Caleidoscop (\\"Kaleidoscope\\").Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.23, 25, 55-56, 62 In one of these accounts, he details his encounter with Lysenkoist agronomist Nikolay Tsistsin, and claims to have tasted bread made from a brand of wheat which yielded 4,000 kilograms of grain per hectare.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.55-56 In a later memoir, Sadoveanu depicted his existence and the destiny of his country as improved by the communist system, and gave accounts of his renewed journeys in the countryside, where he claimed to have witnessed a \\"spiritual splendor\\" supported by \\"the practice of the new times\\".Stanomir, p.27 He would follow up with hundreds of articles on various subjects, published by the communist press, including two 1953 pieces in which he lamented Stalin's death (one of them referred to the Soviet leader as \\"the great genius of progressive mankind\\").Selejan, p.351-352 Upon its publication, the political novel Mitrea Cocor, which depicts the hardships and eventual triumph of its eponymous peasant protagonist, was officially described as the first Socialist realist writing in local literature, and as a turning point in literary history.Boia, Un nou Eminescu, p.72; Selejan, p.152, 224, 319. See also Vasile, p.98, 244 Often compared to Dan Deșliu's ideologized poem Lazăr de la Rusca,Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.282; Selejan, p.152 it is remembered as a controversial epic dictated by ideological requirements, and argued to have been written with assistance from several other authors. Seen by historiographer Lucian Boia as an \\"embarrassing literary fabrication\\",Boia, Un nou Eminescu, p.72 it was rated by literary critics Dan C. Mihăilescu and Luminița Marcu both as one of \\"the most harmful books in Romanian literature\\",Alexandra Olivotto, \\"Cele mai nocive cărți din cultura românească\\", in Cotidianul, October 19, 2005 and by historian Ioan Lăcustă as \\"a propaganda writing, a failure from a literary point of view\\". Ioan Lăcustă, \\"1952. Filmul românesc la raport în Consiliul de Miniștri\\", in Magazin Istoric, January 1998 A praise of collectivization policies that some critics believe was a testimony that Sadoveanu was submitting himself and imposing his public to brainwashing, Mitrea Cocor was preceded by Păuna-Mică, a novel which also idealizes collective farming. With his final published work, the 1951-1952 novel Nicoară Potcoavă, Sadoveanu retells the narrative of his Șoimii, modifying the plot and adding new characters.Cornis-Pope, p.501; Răileanu, p.5; Vianu, Vol.III, p.251-253 Noted among the latter is Olimbiada, a female soothsayer and healer through whose words Sadoveanu again dispenses his own perspective on human existence.Răileanu, p.16-17; Vianu, Vol.III, p.251-253. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.238, 239 The focus of the narrative is also changed: from the avenger of his brother's death in Șoimii, the pretender becomes a purveyor of folk identity, aiming to reestablish the Moldavia of Stephen the Great's times.Răileanu, p.7-10. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.234, 235 Praised early on by Dumitriu, who believed it was proof of \\"artistic excellence\\",Selejan, p.95 Nicoară Potcoavă is itself seen as a source for communist-inspired political messages. According to Cornel Ungureanu, this explains why it highlights the brotherhood between Cossacks and Moldavians, supposedly replicating the official view on Soviet-Romanian relations. Cornis-Pope, who considers the novel one of Sadoveanu's \\"mere variations\\" on old subjects, suggests that it transforms its protagonist \\"from medieval fighter into political philosopher who announces the rise of a 'new world'.\\"Cornis-Pope, p.501 Victor Frunză also notes that, although Sadoveanu returned to old subjects, he \\"no longer rises to the level he had reached before the war.\\" The final part of Sadoveanu's creation also comprises a series of pieces where the narrative approach was, according to Crohmălniceanu, \\"corrected\\" to show his favorite recluse type won over by the new society.Crohmălniceanu, p.212 In essence, Ungureanu argues, the new style that of \\"reportage and plain information, adapted to orders coming from above\\". Such works include the 1951 Nada Florilor (\\"The Flowers' Lure\\") and Clonț-de-fier (\\"Iron Bucktooth\\"), alongside an unfinished piece, Cântecul mioarei (\\"Song of the Ewe\\"). In Nada..., the peasant boy Culai follows his hero, tinsmith Alecuțu, into factory life. Clonț-de-fier, an ideologized retake on Demonul tinereții, is about a monk returning from seclusion into the world of workers, where the landscape is reshaped by large- scale construction works. According to Ungureanu, it also shows Sadoveanu's universe stripped of \\"all its deep meanings.\\" While their author came to personify the new cultural guidelines, Sadoveanu's previous books, from Frații Jderi to Baltagul, were subject to communist censorship. Various statements contradicting the ideological guidelines were cut out of new editions: the books in general could no longer include mentions of Bessarabia (a region first incorporated into the Soviet Union by a 1940 occupation) or Romanian Orthodox beliefs. Teodor Vârgolici, \\"Caracatița cenzurii comuniste\\", in Adevărul, December 27, 2006 In one such instance, censors of Baltagul removed a character's claim that \\"the Russian\\" was by nature \\"the drunkest of them all, [...] a worthy beggar and singer at the fairs.\\" Politics =Nationalism and Humanism= Sadoveanu's engagement in politics was marked by abrupt changes in convictions, seeing him move from right- to left-wing stances several times in his life. In close connection with his traditionalist views on literature, but in contrast to his career under a Conservative Party and National Liberal cabinets, Sadoveanu initially rallied with nationalist groups of various hues, associating with both Nicolae Iorga and, in 1906, with the left-wing Poporanists at Viața Românească. An early cause of his was his attempt to reconcile Iorga with the Poporanists, but his efforts were largely fruitless. Ion Hadârcă, \\"Constantin Stere și Nicolae Iorga: antinomiile idealului convergent (I)\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, June 2006 In the 1910s, the anti-Iorga traditionalist Ilarie Chendi recognized in Sadoveanu one of the Poporanists who promoted \\"the spiritual healing of our people through culture.\\"Chendi, p.62 Around that time, he formulated a ruralist and nationalist perspective on life, rejecting what he deemed \\"the hybrid urban world\\" for \\"the world of our national realities\\". In Călinescu's analysis, this signifies that, like his predecessor, the conservative Eminescu, Sadoveanu believed the cities were victims of the \\"superimposed category\\" of foreigners, in particular those administrating leasehold estates. Following the 1907 Peasants' Revolt, Sadoveanu sent a report to his Minister of Education Spiru Haret, informing him on the state of rural education, and, beyond this, of the problems faced by villagers in Moldavia. It read: \\"The leaseholders and landowners, no matter what their nationality, make a mockery of the Romanians' labors. Every surtucar [that is, urbanized character] in the village, mayors, notaries, paper-pushers, shamelessly [and] mercilessly milk this milk cow. They are joined by the priest—who [...] is in disagreement with the teacher.\\" With Neamul Șoimăreștilor, the burdens of feudal society and mercantilism, most of all the restriction of economic rights, were becoming a background theme in his fiction, which later depicted Stephen the Great as the original champion of social justice (Frații Jderi).Crohmălniceanu, p.226, 229-234, 247-248 During most of his World War I activity, Sadoveanu also followed the Poporanists' Russophobia and dislike of the Entente side, describing the Russian Empire's national policies in Bessarabia as far more barbaric than Austria-Hungary's rule over Transylvania.Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\", p.299-300 In 1916, he abruptly switched to the Entente camp: his enthusiasm as propaganda officer was touched by controversy once Romania experienced massive defeats; Sadoveanu himself abandoned the Entente cause by 1918, when he was decommissioned, and resumed his flirtation with Constantin Stere's Germanophile lobby.Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\", p.237, 300-301, 362 Călinescu sees Sadoveanu, alongside Stere, as one of Viața Româneascăs chief ideologues, noting that he was nonetheless \\"rendered notorious by his inconsistency and opportunism.\\" He writes that Sadoveanu and Stere both showed a resentment for ethnic minorities, particularly members of the Jewish community, whom they saw as agents of exploitation, but that, as Humanists, they had a form of \\"humane sympathy\\" for Jews and foreigners taken individually.Călinescu, p.661-662. Călinescu notes that this is evident in Sadoveanu's novel Haia Sanis, where the Jewish woman is seen as a victim. The Poporanist aspect of Sadoveanu's literature was also highlighted by Garabet Ibrăileanu in the late 1920s, when he referred to his contributions as evidence that Romanian culture was successfully returning to its specific originality.Crohmălniceanu, p.123, 129-130, 142 In essence, Crohmălniceanu writes, Sadoveanu was tied to Viața Românească by his advocacy of national specificity, his preference for the large-scale narrative, and his vision of pristine, \\"natural\\", human beings.Crohmălniceanu, p.198 According to Z. Ornea, Sadoveanu's affiliation to the Freemasonry shaped not only his political \\"demophilia\\", but also his \\"Weltanschauung, and, through a reflex, his [literary] work.\\" By consequence, Ornea argues, Sadoveanu became a supporter of democracy, a stance which led him into open conflict with extreme nationalists. Alongside its Humanism, Sadoveanu's nationalism was noted for being secular, and thus in contrast with the Romanian Orthodox imagery favored by nationalists on the far right. Sadoveanu rejected the notion that ancestral Romanians were religious individuals, stating that their belief was in fact \\"limited to rituals and customs.\\"Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.104 He was also a vocal supporter of international cooperation, particularly among countries in Eastern and Central Europe. Writing for the magazine Familia in 1935, 17 years after Transylvania's union with Romania and 15 years after the Treaty of Trianon, Sadoveanu joined the Hungarian author Gyula Illyés in pleading for good relations between the two neighbors. As noted by Crohmălniceanu, although Sadoveanu's interwar novels may depict both clashes between polities and benign misunderstandings, they ultimately discourage ethnic stereotypes, suggesting that \\"the gifts and qualities of various kinships\\" are mutually compatible.Crohmălniceanu, p.234-235 According to Marcel Cornis-Pope, this cooperative vision is the background theme to Divanul persian, a book \\"demonstrating the value of intercultural dialogue at a time of sharp political polarization.\\" The same text was described by Vianu as evidence of Sadoveanu's \\"understanding, gentleness and tolerance\\". In 1926, the year of his entry into Alexandru Averescu's People's Party, Sadoveanu motivated his choice in a letter to Octavian Goga, indicating his belief that the intelligentsia needed to partake in politics: \\"It would seem that what is foremost needed is the contribution of intellectuals, in an epoch when the overall intellectual level is decreasing.\\" His sincerity was doubted by his contemporaries: both his friend Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești and the communist Petre Pandrea recount how, in 1926–1927, Sadoveanu and Păstorel Teodoreanu requested public funds from Interior Minister Goga, with Sadoveanu motivating that he wanted to set up a cultural magazine and later spending the money on his personal wardrobe. In contrast, Adrian Cioroianu notes that the People's Party episode, and especially the \\"mutual wariness\\" between Sadoveanu and the National Liberals, underlined the writer's sympathy for the \\"intellectual Left\\".Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.281 Himself a Marxist, Ovid Crohmălniceanu suggested that, as early as the 1930s, Sadoveanu's attitudes were rather similar to the official line of communist groups.Crohmălniceanu, p.15, 166 =Opposition to fascism and support for King Carol= During the 1930s, following his stint as head of Adevărul, a leftist newspaper owned by Jewish entrepreneurs, Sadoveanu was targeted by right-wing voices, who claimed that he had chosen to abandon his nationalist credentials.Călinescu, p.661; Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.245, 458-465 Thus, Sadoveanu became the target of a press campaign in the antisemitic and fascist press, and in particular in Nichifor Crainic's Sfarmă-Piatră and the journals connected with the Iron Guard. The former publication deplored his supposed \\"betrayal\\" of the nationalist cause. In it, Ovidiu Papadima portrayed Sadoveanu as the victim of Jewish manipulation, and equated his affiliation to the Freemasonry with devil worship, and mocked his obesity, while Crainic himself compared the writer to his own character, the treacherous Ieremia Golia.Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.463-464 Porunca Vremii often referred to him as Jidoveanu (from jidov, a dismissive term for \\"Jew\\"), depicted him as an agent of \\"Judaeo-communism\\" motivated by \\"perversity\\", and called on the public to harass the writer and beat him with stones.Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.460-461, 463, 465 It also protested when the public authorities in Fălticeni refused to withdraw Sadoveanu the title of honorary citizen, and again when the University of Iași made him a doctor honoris causa, and, through the voice of novelist N. Crevedia, even suggested that the writer should use his hunting rifle to commit suicide.Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.461-462, 464-465 In 1937, Porunca Vremii congratulated ultra-nationalists who had organized public burnings of Sadoveanu's works in Southern Dobruja and in Hunedoara, as well as non- identified people who sent the writer packages containing shredded copies of his own volumes.Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.460-461 In April 1937, the anti- Sadoveanu campaign was met with the indignation of various public figures, who issued an \\"Appeal of the Intellectuals\\", signed by Liviu Rebreanu, Eugen Lovinescu, Petru Groza, Victor Eftimiu, George Topîrceanu, Zaharia Stancu, Demostene Botez, Alexandru Al. Philippide, Constantin Balmuș and others. Denouncing the campaign as a \\"moral assassination\\", it referred to Sadoveanu as the author of \\"the most Romanian [works] in our literature.\\" Sadoveanu himself defended his fellow writer Tudor Arghezi, who stood accused by the far right press of having written \\"pornography\\". Reviewing the consequences of these scandals, Ovid Crohmălniceanu suggests that all of what Mihail Sadoveanu wrote from 1938 to 1943 is in some way connected to the cause of anti- fascism.Crohmălniceanu, p.198-199 According to Cornis-Pope, Sadoveanu's dislike for the far right can be discovered in Creanga de aur, which doubles as \\"a political parable opposing an archaic peasant civilization to the growing threat of fascism.\\" However, George Călinescu claims, the writer himself had not actually revised his nationalist outlook, that he continued to believe that minorities and foreigners were a risky presence in Greater Romania, and that his Humanism was \\"a light tincture\\". In one of his columns, Sadoveanu replied to those organizing the acts of vandalism, indicating that, had they actually read the novels they were destroying, they would have found \\"a burning faith in this nation, for so long mistreated by cunning men\\".Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.461 Elsewhere, stating that he was not going to take his detractors into consideration, Sadoveanu defined himself as an adversary of both Nazi Germany and any form of advocacy for a \\"National-Socialist regime in our country\\".Ornea, Anii treizeci, p.462 Sadoveanu's subsequent endorsement of authoritarian King Carol II and his corporatist force, the National Renaissance Front, saw his participation in the monarch's personality cult. In 1940, he offered controversial praise to the ruler through the official journal, Revista Fundațiilor Regale, which caused Carol's political adversary, psychologist Nicolae Mărgineanu, to deem Sadoveanu and his fellow contributors \\"scoundrels\\". Paula Mihailov, \\"Carol al II-lea - precursorul lui Ceaușescu\\" , in Jurnalul Național, July 12, 2005. The other figures cited in this context are Arghezi, Lucian Blaga, George Călinescu, Constantin Daicoviciu, Perpessicius, Camil Petrescu, Constantin Rădulescu-Motru and Ionel Teodoreanu. His renewed mandate in the Senate was a favor from Carol, also granted to George Enescu, philosopher Lucian Blaga, scientists Emil Racoviță and Iuliu Hațieganu, and several other public figures. During the Ion Antonescu dictatorship, Sadoveanu kept a low profile and was apolitical. However, Cioroianu writes, he supported the invasion of the Soviet Union and Romania's cooperation with the Axis Powers on the Eastern Front, seeing in this a chance to recover Bessarabia and the northern part of Bukovina (lost to the 1940 Soviet occupation). In spring 1944, months before the King Michael Coup toppled the regime, he was approached by the clandestine Romanian Communist Party and its sympathizers in academia to sign an open letter condemning Romania's alliance to Nazi Germany. According to the communist activist Belu Zilber, who took part in this action, Sadoveanu, like his fellow intellectuals Dimitrie Gusti, Simion Stoilow and Horia Hulubei, refused to sign the document. Lavinia Betea, \\" 'Recunoștința' Partidului față de cei care l-au subvenționat\\", in Magazin Istoric, August 1997 Also according to Zilber, Sadoveanu motivated his refusal by stating that the letter needed to be addressed not to Antonescu, but to King Michael I. However, and aside from its main topic, Păuna-Mică was noted as one of the few prose works of the 1940s to mention the wartime deportation of Romanian Jews by Antonescu's regime; Boris Marian, \\"Norman Manea. Despre literatura Holocaustului\\", in Realitatea Evreiască, Nr. 256-257 (1056-1057), June–July 2006 Caleidoscop also speaks about the 1941 Iași pogrom as \\"our shame\\", and commends those who opposed it. Liviu Rotman (ed.), Demnitate în vremuri de restriște, Editura Hasefer, Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania & Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania, Bucharest, 2008, p.74-75, 182. =Partnership with the communists= Communist Romania's leader Nicolae Ceaușescu (front row, left) visiting Sadoveanu's memorial house at Voividenia (1966) Following his Lumina vine de la Răsărit lecture, Sadoveanu became noted for his positive portrayals of communization and collectivization. In particular, Sadoveanu offered praise to one of the major pillars of Stalinism, the 1936 Soviet Constitution.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.34-35; Stanomir, p.24-25 In 1945, claiming to have been \\"flashed upon\\" by \\"Stalin's argumentation\\", he urged the public to read the document for its \\"sincerity\\";Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.34 elsewhere, he equated reading the constitution with \\"a mystical revelation\\".Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.35; Stanomir, p.24 Adrian Cioroianu describes this as \\"an office assignment\\" from the ARLUS, at a time when the group was circulating free translated copies of the Soviet constitution.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.34-35 The enthusiasm of his writings also manifested itself in his public behavior: according to his ARLUS colleague Iorgu Iordan, Sadoveanu was emotional during the 1945 Soviet trip, shedding tears of joy upon visiting a day care center in the countryside.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.50-51. Cioroianu suspects that this episode shows Sadoveanu was copying the behavior of French writer André Gide, who made a similar tour during the 1930s. Running in the 1946 election, Sadoveanu blamed the old political class in general for the problems faced by Romanian peasants, including the major drought of that year. By then, his political partners were making use of his literary fame, and his electoral pamphlet read: \\"There is no doubt that the thousands of people who have read his works will rush out on [election day] to vote for him.\\" After 1948, when the Romanian communist regime was installed, Sadoveanu directed his praise toward the new authorities. In 1952, as Romania adopted its second republican constitution and the authorities intensified repression against anti-communists, Sadoveanu made some of his most controversial statements. Declaring the defunct kingdom to have been a \\"long interval of organized injustice and crooked development in all areas\\", he presented the new order as an era of social justice, human dignity, available culture and universal public education.Stanomir, p.26-27 Criticism of Sadoveanu's moral choices also focuses on the fact that, while he led a luxurious existence, many of his generation colleagues and fellow intellectuals were being persecuted or jailed in notoriously harsh circumstances.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.283-284; Frunză, p.374 Having tolerated the purge within the Romanian Academy, Cioroianu notes, Sadoveanu accepted being colleagues with newly promoted \\"secondary characters [...] whom the new regime needed\\", such as poet Dumitru Theodor Neculuță and historian Mihail Roller.Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx, p.287 In his official capacity, Sadoveanu even signed several death sentences declared by communist tribunals, and, in the wake of the Tămădău Affair of summer 1947, presided over the Chamber sessions which outlawed the opposition National Peasants' Party: according to researcher Victor Frunză, he was a willing participant in this, having been upset by the exposure of his personal wealth in the National Peasantist press.Frunză, p.302-303 Later, Sadoveanu made a reference to his former colleague, the National Peasantist activist Ion Mihalache, arguing that his old Agrarianist approach to politics had made him a \\"ridiculous character\\". Ioan Stanomir describes this fragment as one of \\"intellectual abjection\\", indicating that Mihalache, already a political prisoner of the regime, was to die in captivity. However, as leader of the Romanian Writers' Union, the aging writer is credited by some with having protected poet Nicolae Labiș, a disillusioned communist who had been excluded from the Union of Worker Youth in spring 1954, and whose work Sadoveanu treasured. Adrian Bucurescu, \\"Straniul destin al lui Nicolae Labiș\\", in România Liberă, April 3, 2008 He is also reported to have helped George Călinescu publish the novel Scrinul negru, mediating between him and communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu- Dej. Mihail Sadoveanu provided a definition of his own political transition in conversation with fellow writer Ion Biberi (1946). At the time, he claimed: \\"I have never engaged in politics, in the sense that one assigns to this word.\\" He elaborated: \\"I am a left-wing person, following the line of a Poporanist zeal in the spirit of Viața Românească, but one adapted to the new circumstances.\\"Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.28; partially rendered in Stanomir, p.25 Cioroianu sees in such statements evidence that, trying to discard his past, Sadoveanu was including himself among the socialist intellectuals \\"willing to let themselves be won over by the indescribable charm and the full swing of the communist utopia\\", but that he may in reality have been \\"motivated by fear\\".Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.28. Also according to Cioroianu, Sadoveanu \\"would have perhaps also wanted to be assimilated into the category [...] of radicalized left-wing sympathizers\\", but was in effect a \\"political opportunist\\" (Pe umerii lui Marx, p.281). Paraphrasing communist vocabulary, Stanomir describes the writer as one of the \\"bourgeois\\" personalities who became \\"fellow travelers\\" of the communists, and argues that Sadoveanu's claim to have always leaned towards a \\"people's democracy\\" inaugurated \\"a pattern of chameleonism\\". In the view of historian Vladimir Tismăneanu, Sadoveanu, like Parhon, George Călinescu, Traian Săvulescu and others, was one of the \\"non-communist intellectuals\\" attracted into cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party and the communist regime (Tismăneanu also argues that these figures' good relationship with Gheorghiu- Dej was a factor in the process, as was Gheorghiu-Dej's ability to make himself look \\"harmless\\").Vladimir Tismăneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, Polirom, Iași, 2005, p.161. Others have submitted that Sadoveanu's faction in the Freemasonry, which included far left advocates Mihai Ralea and Alexandru Claudian, and officially supported evolutionary socialism, was a natural partner of the communists, to the point of sanctioning its own state-organized suppression. According to Adrian Cioroianu, Sadoveanu was not necessarily an \\"apostle of communization\\", and his role in the process is subject to much debate.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.22-23 Describing the writer's \\"conversion to philosovietism\\" as \\"purely contextual\\", Cioroianu also points out that the very notion of \\"light arising in the East\\" is read by some as Sadoveanu's encoded message to other Freemasons, warning them of a Soviet threat to the organization. The historian notes that, for all their possible lack in sincerity, Sadoveanu's statements provided a template for other intellectuals to follow—this, he argues, was the case of Cezar Petrescu.Cioroianu, Lumina vine de la Răsărit, p.22 Other statements made by Sadoveanu also displayed a possibly studied ambiguity, as is the case with a 1952 lecture he gave in front of young writers attending the Party-controlled School of Literature, where he implicitly denied that one could be created a writer unless by \\"God or Mother Nature\\".Vasile, p.279 Legacy =Influence= Sadoveanu's prose, in particular his treatment of natural settings, was a direct influence in the works of writers such as Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, Nicolae N. Beldiceanu, Jean Bart, and Al. Lascarov- Moldovanu;Călinescu, p.674, 675, 725, 932 his storytelling techniques were also sometimes borrowed by comedic novelist Damian Stănoiu,Crohmălniceanu, p.371 and, in later years, by historical novelist Dumitru Vacariu. Ioan Holban, \\"Oamenii, ca pietrele din Bistrița\\", in Luceafărul, Nr. 10/2011 According to Călinescu, Sadoveanu's early hunting stories published by Viața Românească, together with those of Junimist Nicolae Gane, helped establish the genre within the framework of Romanian literature, and paved the way for its predilect use in the works of Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești. Călinescu also notes that Scrisorile unui răzeș (\\"Letters of a Peasant\\"), an early work by novelist Cezar Petrescu, are deeply marked by Sadoveanu's influence, and that the same writer's use of the Moldavian dialect is a \\"pastiche\\" from Sadoveanu.Călinescu, p.765 Ion Vinea too, while expressing admiration for Sadoveanu, defined all his disciples and imitators as \\"mushroom-writers from Sadoveanu's woods\\" and \\"butlers who steal [their lord's lingerie] in order to wear his blazon\\".Cernat, p.145 The issue was much later discussed by writer- critic Ioan Holban, who likewise described most historical novelists inspired by Sadoveanu as \\"insignificant\\" to Romanian letters. Under the early stages of the communist regime, before the rise of Nicolae Ceaușescu engendered a series of rehabilitations and accommodated nationalism, the Romanian curriculum was dependent on ideological guidelines. At the time, Sadoveanu was one of the writers from the interwar whose work was still made available to Romanian schoolchildren.Boia, Un nou Eminescu, p.71-72; Mihăilescu, p.87 In the 1953 Romanian language and literature manual, he represented his generation alongside the communist authors Alexandru Toma and Alexandru Sahia, and was introduced mainly through his Mitrea Cocor. At the time, studies of his work were published by prominent communist critics, among them Ovid Crohmălniceanu,Mihăilescu, p.313 Paul Georgescu, Traian Șelmaru, Mihai Novicov, Eugen Campus and Dumitru Isac,Selejan, p.137, 320-324 while a 1953 reissue of Baltagul was published in 30,000 copies (a number rarely met by the Romanian publishing industry in that context).Selejan, p.236 In later years, Profira Sadoveanu became a noted promoter of her father's literature and public image, publishing children's versions of his biography, notably featuring illustrations by Mac Constantinescu (1955 edition).Crohmălniceanu, p.586-587 Although Sadoveanu continued to be hailed as a major writer during the Ceaușescu years, and the seventy years of his debut were marked with state ceremony, the reaction against Soviet influence affected presentations of his work: his official bibliography no longer included any mention of Păuna-Mică. Among the memoirs dealing with Sadoveanu's late years were those of Alexandru Rosetti, published in 1977. The official revival of nationalist discourse in the 1960s allowed controversial critic Edgar Papu to formulate his version of Protochronism, which postulated that phenomenons within Romanian culture preceded developments in world culture. In this context, Papu spoke of Sadoveanu as \\"one of the great precursory voices\\", comparing him to Rabindranath Tagore.Mihăilescu, p.153 After the 1989 Revolution toppled communism, Sadoveanu remained an influence on some young authors, who recovered the themes of his work in a Postmodern or parodic manner. Among them is Dan Lungu, who, according to critic Andrei Terian, alluded to the Hanu Ancuței frame story when constructing his 2004 novel Paradisul găinilor. Andrei Terian, \\"Momeala povestitorului\\", in Ziarul Financiar, September 7, 2007 In 2001, a poll carried among literati by Observator Cultural magazine listed six of his works as some of the best 150 Romanian novels. \\"150 de romane\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 45-46, January 2001 Mihail Sadoveanu's various works were widely circulated abroad. This phenomenon began as early as 1905, when German-language translations were first published,Vianu, Vol.III, p.229 and continued during the 1930s, when Venea o moară pe Siret... was translated very soon after its original Romanian edition. In 1931, female author and feminist militant Sarina Cassvan included French-language versions of his texts into an anthology designed to promote modern Romanian culture internationally.Cernat, p.221 Also then, some of Sadoveanu's texts were rendered in Chinese by Lu Xun.Cristian Popișteanu, \\"Ultima locuință a scriitorului\\", in Magazin Istoric, October 1977, p.19 Tudor Vianu attributes the warm international reception Sadoveanu generally received to his abilities in rendering the Romanians' \\"own way of sensing and seeing nature and humanity\\", while literary historian Adrian Marino points out that, Sadoveanu and Liviu Rebreanu were exceptional in their generation for taking an active interest in how their texts were translated, edited and published abroad.Adrian Marino, Pentru Europa. Integrarea României: Aspecte ideologice și culturale, Polirom, Iași, 2005, p.66-67. Later, publicizing Sadoveanu's work to Eastern Bloc and world audiences became a priority for the communist regime. Thus, Mitrea Cocor was, together with similar works by Zaharia Stancu and Eusebiu Camilar, among the first wave of Romanian books to have been translated into Czech and published in Communist Czechoslovakia. Eugenia Bojoga, \\"Manifestare culturală la Praga\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr.332, August 2006 Alongside similar works by Petru Dumitriu, Mitrea Cocor was also among the few English-language editions sanctioned by the Romanian regime, being translated and published, with a preface by Jack Lindsay, in 1953.Dennis Deletant, \\"Romania\\", in Peter France (ed.), The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation, Oxford University Press, Oxford etc., 2000, p.215. Nine years later, the collected short stories were a tool for cultural exchange between Romania and the United States. Sadoveanu's good standing in the Soviet Union after World War II also made him one of the few Romanian writers whose works were still being published in the Moldavian SSR (which, as part of Bessarabia, had previously been a region of Greater Romania). Sadoveanu's diaries and notes were collected and edited during the early 2000s, being published in 2006 by Editura Junimea and the MLR. The main coordinators of this project were literary historian Constantin Ciopraga and Constantin Mitru, who was Sadoveanu's brother-in-law and personal secretary. The popularity of his writings remained high into the early 21st century: in 2004, when the country marked a hundred years since Sadoveanu's debut, Șoimii was published in its 15th edition. According to Simuț, the occasion itself was nevertheless marked with \\"the impression of general indifference\\", making Sadoveanu seem \\"a submerged continent, remembered by us only with piousness and confusion\\". =Tributes= Sadoveanu is an occasional presence in the literary works of his fellow generation members. His Țara de dincolo de negură was partly written as a tribute to George Topîrceanu's piece of the same name, with both authors sketching an affectionate portrait of one another.Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.20-29 Topîrceanu also parodied his friend's style in a five-paragraph sketch, part of a series of such fragments, recorded their encounters in various other autobiographical writings, and dedicated him the first version of his poem Balada popii din Rudeni (\\"Ballad of the Priest from Rudeni\\").Topîrceanu, Vol. II, p.244, 422-423 (Săndulescu, in Topîrceanu, Vol. I, p.288) Under the name Nicolae Pădureanu, Sadoveanu is a character in the novel and disguised autobiography În preajma revoluției (\\"On the Eve of the Revolution\\"), authored by his colleague Constantin Stere.Călinescu, p.761. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.379 Sadoveanu is honored in two writings by Nicolae Labiș, collectively titled Sadoveniene (\\"Sadovenians\\"). The first, titled Mihail Sadoveanu, is a prose poem which alludes to Sadoveanu's prose, and the other, a free verse piece, is titled Cozma Răcoare.Nicolae Labiș, Poezii, Editura Albatros, Bucharest, 1985, p.21-24. In his scientific study of Sadoveanu's work, Eugen Lovinescu himself turns to pure literature, portraying Sadoveanu as a child blessed by the Moirai or ursitoare with ironic gifts, such as an obstinacy for nature writing in the absence of actual observation (\\"You shall write; you shall write and could never stop yourself writing [...]. The readers will grow tired, but you will remain tireless; you shall not known rest, just as you shall not know nature [...]\\"). George Călinescu was one to object to this portrayal, noting that it was merely a \\"literary device which hardly covers the emptiness of [Lovinescu's] idea.\\" Also during the interwar, philosopher Mihai Ralea made Mihail Sadoveanu the subject of a sociological study investigating his literary contributions in the context of social evolutions.Vianu, Vol.III, p.147-148 A portrait of Sadoveanu was drawn by graphic artist Ary Murnu, within a larger work which depicts the Kübler Coffeehouse society. Sadoveanu was also the subject of a 1929 painting by Ștefan Dumitrescu, part of a series on Viața Românească figures.Ionel Jianu, Ștefan Dimitrescu, Editura de stat pentru literatură și artă, Bucharest, 1954, p.24-26, illustration 32. In its original edition, Mitrea Cocor was supposed to feature a series of drawings made by Corneliu Baba, one of the best-known Romanian visual artists for his generation.Zambaccian, Corneliu Baba, illustrations 10-12, 35-40 Baba, who had been officially criticized for \\"formalism\\", was pressured by the authorities into accepting the commission or risk a precarious existence. Alina Purcaru, \\"Corneliu Baba: autoportretul din dosarul de cadre PCR\\", in Cotidianul, September 28, 2007 The result of his work was rejected with a similar label, and the sketches were for long not made available to the public. Baba also painted Sadoveanu's portrait, which, in 1958, art critic Krikor Zambaccian as \\"the synthesis of Baba's art\\", depicting \\"a man of letters aware of his mission [and] the leading presence of an active consciousness\\".Zambaccian, Corneliu Baba, p.16 Constantin Mitru inherited the painting and passed it on to the Museum of Romanian Literature (MLR). \\"Portretul lui Sadoveanu pictat de Baba intră definitiv în patrimoniul Casei-muzeu din Iași\\", in Adevărul, June 8, 2002 A marble bust of Sadoveanu, the work of Ion Irimescu, was set up in Fălticeni in 1977.

However, the first film based on his works was a German production of 1929: based on Venea o moară... and titled Sturmflut der Liebe (\\"Storm Tide of Love\\"), it notably starred Marcella Albani, Alexandru Giugaru and Ion Brezeanu. The series of Romanian-made films began with the 1952 Mitrea Cocor, co-directed by Marietta Sadova (who also starred in the film) and Victor Iliu.Vasile, p.244-247 The film itself was closely supervised for conformity with ideological guidelines, and had to be partly redone because its original version did not meet them. Mircea Drăgan directed a 1965 version of Neamul Șoimăreștilor (with a screenplay co-written by Constantin Mitru) and a 1973 adaptation of Frații Jderi (with contributions by Mitru and by Profira Sadoveanu). In 1969, Romanian studios produced a film version of Baltagul, directed by Mircea Mureșan and with Sidonia Manolache as Vitoria Lipan. Ten years later, Constantin Vaeni released Vacanță tragică (\\"Tragic Holiday\\"), based on Nada Florilor, followed by a 1980 adaptation of Dumbrava minunată and Stere Gulea's 1983 Ochi de urs (tr. \\"The Bear Eye's Curse\\"). In 1989, just before the Romanian Revolution, Dan Pița produced his film The Last Ball in November, based on Locul unde nu s-a întâmplat nimic. During the early decades of communist rule, Sadoveanu, Alexandru Toma and later Tudor Arghezi were often paid homage with state celebrations, likened by literary critic Florin Mihăilescu to the personality cult reserved for Stalin and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.Mihăilescu, p.89 For a while after the writer's death, the Writers' Union club, commonly known as \\"The Writers' House\\", bore Sadoveanu's name. Casa cu turn in Iași, which Sadoveanu had donated to the state in 1950, went through a period of neglect and was finally set up as a museum in 1980. Similar sites were set up in his Fălticeni house, Cultural - Muzee. Casa Memorială Mihail Sadoveanu, at falticeni.ro; retrieved April 6, 2008 and in his final residence at Voividenia, while the Bradu-Strâmb chalet was controversially granted to the Securitate, and later to the Romanian Police. Each year, Iași commemorates the writer through a cultural festival known as the \\"Mihail Sadoveanu Days\\". \\"Iași. Un secol de Sadoveanu\\", in Evenimentul, November 6, 2004 In 2004, the 100th anniversary of his debut was marked by a series of exhibits and symposiums, organized by the MLR. Similar events are regularly held in various cities, and include the \\"In Sadoveanu's Footsteps\\" colloquy of writers, held during March 2006 in the city of Piatra Neamț. Dominica Vasiliu, \\"Zeci de scriitori 'Pe urmele lui Sadoveanu' \\", in Monitorul de Neamț, March 9, 2006 Since 2003, in tribute to Sadoveanu's love for the game, an annual chess tournament is held in Iași.

Pașcani hosts a cultural center, a high school and a library named after him. Sadoveanu's memory is also regularly honored in the Republic of Moldova, where, in 2005, the 125th anniversary of his birth was celebrated in an official context. A street in Chișinău and a high school in the town of Cupcini are also named after him.

It was developed in 1983 and released in June 1984. Atari originally intended to release the game in 1983, but it was delayed due to technical issues and difficulties, so it was returned to the lab for further testing and research, and was not fully released until June 1984. Only a total of 750–1000 machines were produced. The arcade machine comes with two games. The first is I, Robot, a multi-directional shooter that has the player assume the role of \\"Unhappy Interface Robot #1984\\", a servant bot that rebels against Big Brother. The object of the game involves the servant bot going through 126 levels, turning red squares to blue to destroy Big Brother's shield and eye. The player can switch to the second game, Doodle City, a drawing tool that lasts for three minutes. I, Robot is known for being the first commercially produced video game with filled 3D polygon graphics with flat shading, as well as being the first video game to feature camera-control options. Its name was originally \\"Ice Castles\\", but was changed to \\"I, Robot\\". Upon release of the game, I, Robot received poor reception and was a financial flop.(October 6, 2010). I, Robot database, Coin-op Games and Machines: Arcade History. Approximately 750–1000 units of the game were created, with few having been confirmed to exist today. However, the remaining arcade cabinets have become rare collectibles and the game has received later praise for its innovative 3D graphics.Buchanan, Levi (August 28, 2008). The Revolution of I, Robot, IGN, Archived from the original on February 17, 2012 on the Wayback Machine.Boris, Dan. Dan B's I, Robot Tech Page. Retrieved August 17, 2011. Author David Ellis listed it as one of the \\"notable classics\\" of its time.I, Robot Gameplay Gameplay of \\"Unhappy Interface Robot #1984\\" walking on squares to change them from red to blue to destroy Big Brother's shield and its eye. In I, Robot, the player controls \\"Unhappy Interface Robot #1984\\", a servant robot that has become self-aware and decides to rebel against Big Brother. To advance from level to level, the robot must destroy the giant blinking eye of Big Brother, first by wearing down its shield and then attacking the eye directly. The robot fires energy at the shield by moving over red blocks in the level, converting them to blue. Although the robot can jump, the robot will be destroyed if jumping while the eye is open. Various extra hazards, such as birds, bombs and flying sharks, can also destroy the robot during each level. At the end of some levels, rather than destroying the eye immediately, the robot must navigate a maze and collect gems before it encounters the eye at close range. Once a level is completed, the robot flies through outer space and must shoot or avoid \\"tetras\\", meteors, and various obstacles (including a floating head that fires nails) to reach the next level. The player can adjust the camera angle during gameplay, moving closer to the robot or flying up for an overhead view of the level. The closer the camera is to the robot, the greater the score multiplier, but the more difficult it is to see the whole level and Big Brother. In later levels, enemies known as \\"viewer killers\\" begin attacking the camera directly, forcing the player to either change the viewing angle or move the robot so that the camera will follow it. Failing to avoid a viewer killer costs the player a life. There are 26 unique level designs; after completing all of them, the levels repeat at a higher difficulty and with a different color palette, as in Atari's earlier game Tempest. After completing a total of 126 levels, the player is thrown back to a random earlier level. The game ends when the player runs out of lives. =Doodle City= Doodle City, referred to in the game as an ungame, is a simple drawing tool which presents the player with a selection of objects from the \\"game\\" mode. The player can move and rotate each shape and can cause trails to be left on the screen as they are moved. The player can remain in this mode for up to three minutes per credit, and can switch back to the main game at any time. One life is subtracted from the player's life pool for each minute spent in Doodle City. Development The game features amplified stereo and pixel graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 central processing unit and four Atari POKEY audio chips. I, Robot was originally called \\"Ice Castles\\". Dave Sherman developed the custom bit-slice ('pepperoni') 3D co-processor that allowed for a throughput of approximately 2,000 polygons per second. It includes four AMD 2901 4-bit slice programmable ALU chips. I, Robot's cabinet was identical to the Firefox upright. The cabinet was furnished with an Atari patented Hall-effect joystick, two fire buttons and two buttons to control the players viewing angle. Reception I, Robot received a poor reception on release. Approximately 750–1000 units of the game were created. Few have been confirmed to exist today. The arcade cabinets have since become rare collectibles with Dave Theurer's involvement being a selling point among collectors. Computer and Video Games magazine reviewed the game in 1985, stating that the \\"graphics are perhaps the most unusual of any arcade game around\\" but is nevertheless \\"a cubist's delight.\\" In 2001, author John Sellers described I, Robot as a \\"near miss\\" because of its strong release that didn't gain enough popularity. He further praised the game, calling it enjoyable and influential. Author David Ellis listed it as one of the \\"notable classics\\" of its time, calling it \\"quirky\\". In 2008, Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition listed it as the number ninety arcade game in technical, creative and cultural impact, citing its innovative 3D graphics. Gamasutra placed I, Robot on its \\"20 Atari Games\\" list, saying that \\"This is the kind of brilliance Atari could field in its halcyon days\\". The game has been cited as the first arcade game to use 3D polygon graphics, and holds a Guinness World Record for the milestone. IGN.com's Levi Buchanan and Craig Harris included I Robot to their \\"Dream Arcades\\" articles. Mean Machines placed it on its wishlist for arcade games to appear on consoles, believing the Super Famicom would do that game justice. A rumor persisted that Atari shipped 500 unsold units to Japan with instructions to dump the units into the ocean at the halfway point. Atari employee Rusty Dawe dispelled this rumor as a \\"total myth\\" in a 2009 interview, adding \\"I would have LIKED to dump [the] I, Robot controls into the ocean [as they were a] total nightmare. But that didn't happen either.\\" References External links * *I, Robot at the Arcade History database * The GameRoom Blog: Rare Game Room Gems — I, Robot by Atari Category:1984 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Atari arcade games Category:Cancelled Atari 2600 games Category:Video games about robots Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Computers using bit-slice designs ","title":"I, Robot (video game)"},{"id":"913571","text":"Bad Radio was a four-piece, American funk rock band that formed in San Diego, California in 1986.

Though established as an all-male manual trade / vocational school by the Baltimore City Council and the Baltimore City Public Schools, it is now a coeducational academic institution that emphasizes sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is located on a tract of land in North Baltimore on the east bank of the Jones Falls stream which runs from the north near the \\"Mason–Dixon line\\" border between Maryland and Pennsylvania to the south emptying in the Northwest Branch of the lower Patapsco River/Inner Harbor between downtown and Fells Point. Also running parallel to the extensive Poly campus is the Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83). The institute is located at the northwest intersection of Falls Road (Maryland Route 25) and West Cold Spring Lane, in northwestern Baltimore City, bordering the neighborhoods of Cross Keys to the north, Roland Park to the east, Hampden to the south, Woodberry to the southwest and I-83 /Jones Falls to the west and Park Heights and Pimlico further northwest. BPI and the adjacent Western High School (founded in 1844, it's the oldest all girls public high school in America and one of the oldest compared to private/independent/secular single sex schools as Poly formerly was until 1974) are located on the same campus, share several amenities including a cafeteria, auditorium, center courtyard and athletic fields, as well as a collaborative marching band recently united, now known as the Marching Flock (referring to the two schools' mascots - The \\"Poly Parrot\\" and the Western High \\"Doves\\"). BPI is a \\"Maryland Blue Ribbon School of Excellence\\" cited by the Maryland State Department of Education.  History  BPI was founded in 1883, after Joshua Plaskitt petitioned the Baltimore City authorities to establish a school for instruction in engineering. The original school was named the Baltimore Manual Training School, and its first class was made up of about sixty students, all of whom were male. The official name of the school was changed in the 1893 to \\"The Baltimore Polytechnic Institute\\" by the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners. The first principals were Dr. Richard Grady, Lt. John D. Ford (U.S.N.), and Lieutenant William King (U.S.N.), after whom one of the three main campus buildings - King Memorial Hall was named in the 1980s. The first building was located on the former site of the old central City Spring on Courtland Street just north of East Saratoga Street of which the area was later contained in Baltimore's first \\"urban renewal\\" plan with the tearing down of five square blocks of houses along Courtland and Saint Paul Streets to the west and the construction of Preston Gardens and Saint Paul Place from East Lexington Street to East Centre Street in the north in 1923. The former BMTS / BPI building (and earlier elementary school dating back to the 1840s) became home to the Baltimore City Department of Welfare and was later annexed by neighboring Mercy Hospital (formerly named Baltimore City Hospital) on North Calvert and Saratoga Streets to the east and later torn down for construction of their first hospital tower in 1964. In 1983, at the school's centennial observation, a historical plaque was placed in the lobby of the hospital commemorating that earlier first home of the Manual Training School for 30 years, later to become \\"Poly\\". It just so happened in an amazing coincidence, that this building was across the street and 44 years later, almost a half-century after their long-time rival public high school The Baltimore City College (\\"City\\") was established in a row house in 1839 for a few short years, also on the now vanished narrow alley-like Courtland Street. Baltimore Polytechnic Institute on the 200 block of East North Avenue, 1913–1967. Later renamed and served as the Calvert Educational Center until partially razed and renovated in the mid-1980s as the BCPS Alice Pinderhughes administrative headquarters (nicknamed \\"North Avenue\\") North Avenue was formerly Boundary Avenue, 1818-1888 - northern city limits), between North Calvert Street and Guilford Avenue to the east. = Relocation = Due to continued growth of the student population of the BCPS and especially in the growing demand for higher secondary education at high schools like at BPI and BCC and the girls schools, the technical school relocated in 1913 to Calvert Street and North Avenue. The former 1860s converted mansion of the Maryland School for the Blind was purchased sitting on a slight hill and two massive wings on the east and west sides were added with a Greek Revival style columns on the front facade. For the first time in its 30 years history \\"Tech\\" had a suitable building expansive enough to handle both its academic and technical education requirements. By 1930, the old original central wing of \\"The Mansion\\" was razed and replaced by a simpler center wing between the two flanking 1913 structures with an additional large enormous auditorium/gymnasium wing further to the east facing North Avenue were constructed. This massive assembly hall was the largest at the time in the city and served many secular/civic/cultural occasions and events for decades into the mid-1980s. While at this location, the school expanded both its academic, technical and athletic programs under the extensive longtime supervision of Dr. Wilmer Dehuff, who was fourth principal from 1921 to 1958 and reluctantly (see below) oversaw the racial integration of the school in 1952, the first instance in City of Baltimore public schools with admitting African-American/then called \\"Negro\\" - \\"Colored\\" students and two years before the rest of the nation took up this serious issue of discrimination addressed finally by the Supreme Court of the United States in May 1954 in the famous case of Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Previous black students had attended Frederick Douglass High School (formerly the \\"Colored High School\\" - second oldest in the nation - founded the same year as Poly - 1883) and the Paul Laurence Dunbar High School Templeton (Winter 1954), p. 22-29Thomsen (Fall 1984), p. 235-238 Dehuff later served after his 37 years career at Poly, as the president and Dean of Faculty at the University of Baltimore on Mount Royal Avenue. = Integration/Desegregation = Most Baltimore City public schools were not integrated until after the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. BPI had an unusually advanced and difficult college engineering \\"A\\" preparatory curriculum which included calculus, analytical chemistry, electricity, mechanics and surveying; these subjects were not offered at the black high schools in the city before 1952. BPI was a whites-only school but supported by taxes on the general population. No black schools in the city (black students could not attend whites-only schools) offered such courses, nor did they have classrooms, labs, libraries or teachers comparable to those at BPI City College. Because of this a group of 16 African American students, with help and support from their parents, the Baltimore Urban League and the NAACP, applied for the engineering \\"A\\" course at the Poly; the applications were denied and the students sued. The subsequent trial began on June 16, 1952. The NAACP's intentions were to end segregation at the 50-year-old public high school. In the BPI case they argued that BPI's offerings of specialized engineering courses violated the \\"separate but equal\\" clause because these courses were not offered in high schools for black students. To avoid integration, an out-of-court proposal was made to the Baltimore City school board to start an equivalent \\"A\\" course at the \\"colored\\" (for non-whites) Frederick Douglass High School. The hearing on the \\"Douglass\\" plan lasted for hours, with Dehuff and others arguing that separate but equal \\"A\\" courses would satisfy constitutional requirements and NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall arguing that the plan was a gamble and cost the city should not take. By a vote of 5–3, the board decided that a separate \\"A\\" course would not provide the same educational opportunities for African American students, and that, starting that fall, African American students could attend Poly. The vote vindicated the NAACP national strategy of raising the cost of 'separate but equal' schools beyond what taxpayers were willing to pay.Olson, Sherry H. Baltimore: The Building of an American City (1997) p. 368-69. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland. Thirteen African American students, Leonard Cephas, Carl Clark, William Clark, Milton Cornish, Clarence Daly, Victor Dates, Alvin Giles, Bucky Hawkins, Linwood Jones, Edward Savage, Everett Sherman, Robert Young, and Silas Young, finally entered the school that fall. They were faced daily with racial epithets, threats of violence and isolation from many of the more than 2,000 students at the school. The first of those students to graduate from Poly was Dr. Carl O. Clark in 1955. Dr. Clark went on to become the first African-American to graduate from the University of South Carolina with a degree in Physics in 1976. = Modern campus (1960s-present) = In 1967, then-principal Claude Burkert (1958–1969) oversaw the relocation of his school to its current location at 1400 West Cold Spring Lane, a fifty-three acre tract of land bordering Falls Road and Roland Park. Also occupying this site is the Western High School, an all-girls school founded in 1844. Notable buildings on the campus include Dehuff Hall, also known as the academic building, where students attend normal classes, and Burkert Hall, also called the engineering building, where students attend classes in the Willard Hackerman Engineering Program. Both Western High School and Poly students make use of the auditorium/cafeteria complex, and likewise share the swimming pool and sports fields. Although the two schools share these facilities, their respective academic programs and classrooms are completely separate from one another. In 1974, Poly officially became coeducational when it began admitting female students. The first female to enroll and successfully graduate from the \\"A\\" course was an African-American named Cindy White (1974–1978). In the late 1980s, the title \\"principal\\" was changed to \\"director.\\" After the retirement of Director John Dohler in 1990, Barbara Stricklin became the first woman to head the school, as she accepted the title of Interim Director. Auditorium, shared by Poly and Western students During Director Ian Cohen's tenure (1994–2003), Poly's curriculum was again expanded when it began offering Advanced placement (AP) classes. During the 2001–2002 school year, Poly was recognized by the Maryland State Department of Education when it was named a \\"Blue Ribbon School of Excellence.\\" In 2011, Poly was ranked 1552 nationally and 44 in Maryland as a \\"Silver Medal School\\" by U.S. News and World Report. In 2004, Dr. Barney Wilson, a 1976 Poly graduate, became Baltimore Polytechnic Institute's first African-American Director. In August 2010, assistant principal Matthew Woolston, was appointed interim Director. Later on during the year, Jacqueline Williams was appointed as interim director for the 2011–2012 school year. By the end of the school year – and after a two-year, nationwide search – Williams became the first female Director of the institution. Williams worked her way through the Poly ranks from student (Class of 1981), to teacher, then department head, to assistant principal, and to Dean of Students, before appointment to her current position as Director.  Academics  Poly is a magnet school with specialized courses drawing students from across Baltimore's regular district boundaries. Admission to the school is highly competitive. Course concentrations include: the Honors STEM Program; the Ingenuity Project offering advanced science and math in conjunction with area universities; AP Capstone emphasizing Social Sciences and Humanities; and Computer Science. In its 2019 nationwide survey of STEM programs spanning 2015-2019, Newsweek ranked Poly #36 among US high schools.  Athletics  Poly's Lumsden-Scott Stadium In addition to the school's football program, Poly's sports include basketball, soccer, cross-country, track and field, lacrosse, baseball, hockey, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. The boys' basketball team won three state championship titles in a row between 2016–2019. The Poly Engineers baseball team has won nine Baltimore City championships since 2005 under head coach Corey Goodwin. = Football = Since the early 1900s the Engineers, along with City College, had dominated the Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) football scene. However, since joining the MPSSAA in 1993, Poly made it to the final game once in 1993, the semifinals once in 1997 and the quarterfinals in 1994 and 1998.  Poly and City  The Poly-City football rivalry is the oldest American football rivalry in Maryland and one of the oldest public school rivalries in the U.S.—predated by the rivalry between the Boston Latin School and the English High School of Boston.Patterson (2000), p. 7. The rivalry began in 1889, when a team from Baltimore City College (City) met a team from the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (Poly), and has continued annually. City leads the series with the record standing at 63–62–6. = Early years = Little is known of the first American football game between Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (Poly) and Baltimore City College (City) in 1889, except that a JV team from Poly met City, in Clifton Park and City emerged the victor. That began the oldest football rivalry in Maryland. City continued to win against Poly through 1901, however in 1902, for the only time in history of the series no game was played; though, in 1931, an extra game was played to compensate.Leonhart (1939), p. 219. Between 1903 and 1906, City won the series, but the tide turned in 1907, when the first tie in the series occurred.Leonhart (1939), p. 221. The next year Poly scored its first victory in the rivalry. = 1910s and 1920s = Poly dominated the series in the 1910s. The only year of the decade that City won was 1912,Leonhart (1939), p. 229. and between 1914 and 1917, Poly shut out City. Poly's streak continued through 1921, completing a nine-year winning streak, which City broke in 1922 with a 27–0 victory.Leonhart (1939) p. 224. In 1926, one of the most famous Poly-City games was played. Prior to the game, the eligibility of City's halfback, Mickey Noonen, was challenged. A committee was formed to investigate Noonen's eligibility, but Noonen's father—frustrated with the investigation—struck one of the members of the committee. The result was that Noonen was not only barred from the team, but also expelled from the Baltimore City school system.Leonhart (1939), p. 225–226. In spite of Noonen's removal, the two teams met at the Baltimore Stadium with 20,000 fans in attendance. The game remained scoreless well into the fourth quarter. Finally, Poly's Harry Lawrence—who later became a coach at City—kicked a successful field goal from the 30-yard leading to a 3–0 victory over City. = 1930s and 1940s = The 1930s ushered in a period of resurgence for the City team. Poly, which had dominated in the previous two decades, only picked up two wins in the 1930s. In 1934, Harry Lawrence, who had kicked the winning field goal against City in 1926, became the head coach at his former rival.Leonhart (1939), p. 227. Lawrence led City to a series of victories over Poly through the 1930s and early 1940s. In 1944, the game, which had been played on the Saturday following Thanksgiving, was moved to Thanksgiving Day. The change was the result of a scheduling conflict with the Army–Navy Game.Patterson (2000), p. 8. The game remained on Thanksgiving Day for nearly 50 years. = Lumsden and Young: 1950s and 1960s = Poly won five straight games against City to open the 1950s, and 9 of the decade's 10 games, under legendary coach Bob Lumsden, for whom the school's current football stadium is named. Lumsden finished with an 11–7 record against City when he retired as head coach in 1966. He also coached 9–0 Poly to the unofficial National High School Championship Game at Miami's Orange Bowl in 1962, against the Miami High Stingarees, but Poly lost by a score of 14–6. The team's fortunes changed later in the 1960s, when City was coached by George Young. Young guided his teams to six wins over Poly, and an equal number of Maryland Scholastic Association championships. One of Young's most memorable victories occurred on Thanksgiving Day, 1965, at Memorial Stadium, when undefeated City beat undefeated Poly 52–6. = 1970s–present = Poly controlled the series throughout the 1970s, and well into the 1980s. City lost a total of 17 consecutive games to Poly, before winning the 99th meeting between the two programs in 1987. Poly's dominance during this period is the longest winning streak in the series. City also went on to win the historic 100th showdown a year later, before Poly got on another roll, starting with the 101st clash in 1989. Baltimore City's public schools withdrew from the Maryland State Athletic Association, in 1993, and joined the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA). This change meant that the football season would end earlier, forcing Poly and City to move their game from Thanksgiving Day to the first Saturday in November. Poly and City met for the 119th time in November 2007, a contest marred by the outbreak of a large brawl outside M&T; Bank Stadium after the final whistle. Poly and City met for the 120th time on November 8, 2008. Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and Baltimore City College then met for the 121st time on November 7, 2009 with the score of 26–20. Poly and City met for the 122nd time on November 6, 2010. As of the 2018 game, City had won the prior 7 contests. =Basketball= In February 2020, ESPN ranked the boys basketball team in the top 25 in the country.

It is located in the village of Newtonville. The school from 2009 to 2010 underwent controversial reconstruction of its facility, making it one of the largest and most expensive high schools ever built in the United States, with a price tag of nearly US$200 million. The new building opened for classes in September 2010. History In the 1850s, high school classes in Newton were conducted in buildings shared with grammar schools in the villages of Newton Centre, West Newton, Upper Falls, and Newton Corner. In 1859, Newton's population topped 8,000 residents for the first time, a threshold that required the town under Massachusetts state law to construct a separate high school. Newton High School's first principal was J.N. Beals, for whom the current Beals House was named. Beals also served as one of the new school's two teachers, along with Amy Breck. Beals left the job for health reasons after only one year and was replaced by E.D. Adams, for whom the current Adams House was named. The first Newton High School building, located on Walnut Street in Newtonville, opened in September 1859, and was modified in 1875. In 1898, the original building was replaced with a new building, also on Walnut Street. This building, the Classical Newton High School, eventually became known as Building I. The next building (Building II, circa 1906) was the Vocational High School, and the third building of the Newton High School complex (Building III) opened in 1926 on Walnut Street. A field house/gymnasium building (also known as \\"the drill shed\\"), adjacent to Building I, was also part of the complex, as were the athletic fields. Buildings I, II, and III were connected to each other via a series of maintenance tunnels. Newton High School was Newton's only public high school for more than 100 years until 1960, when Newton South High School opened. Newton High School was renamed Newton North High School in 1973 when a new building opened on Lowell Avenue. The first graduating class as \\"Newton North High School\\" was in the spring of 1974. After Newton North was built, all of the former \\"Newton High School\\" buildings were demolished. = Reconstruction = The old building at 360 Lowell Avenue By 2003, the \\"old\\" Newton North building was 30 years old and aging poorly, with leaks, poor ventilation and crumbling stairs. After extensive community debate and a citizen review panel, a decision was reached to construct a replacement high school, with the final cost ultimately totaling $197.5 million, making it one of the most expensive high schools ever built in the state. A project consultant explained that the project's relatively high cost was partly due to demolition of the existing building, hazardous material abatement in the existing building, and the new school's complex program, which includes a natatorium, vocational technology education program, and culinary arts facilities. Old building being dismantled At a public hearing in June 2006, community residents criticized the plan for its cost and for creating a new four-way intersection at Walnut Street and Trowbridge Avenue. Others claimed the proposed north-south orientation and lack of a basement level would waste energy as compared to the current structure. Nonetheless, after a public referendum and vote in January 2007, Newton residents approved the current plan for a new building. Gund Partnership designed the new building, and Dore and Whittier Architects was the Architect of Record. Dimeo Construction Company was the construction manager and general contractor for the project. The removal of the asbestos, laden throughout the existing building, was priced at $10 million.Mesothelioma News. The building was dismantled, with contaminated construction debris packaged in lined cardboard boxes and shipped out in 650 trailer loads. Newton North High School project, Costello Dismantiling The construction site of the new Newton North in September, 2009 The new building is oriented on a north–south axis on the eastern side of the current lot, with athletic fields to the west and a soccer field on the east side. The main entrance has returned to Walnut Street, as was the case from 1859 to 1973. The new building places the school office in a more accessible location – it was on the third floor in the old building – and ensures that most classrooms have natural light and windows to the outside. The school incorporates many features that improve energy efficiency, and is among the first LEED-certified schools in the state. Green features include rooftop solar panels, systems to reuse rainwater, interior materials with low emission of volatile organic compounds, and occupancy motion sensors. Unlike the previous school building, where 50 percent of the classrooms did not have windows or access to daylight, classrooms in the new school receive natural light; light fixtures are dimmed based on the amount of daylight to conserve energy. House system The school is divided into administrative units called \\"Houses\\". Each has its own office, secretary, and Dean (formerly \\"Housemaster\\"), who deals with administrative and disciplinary matters for house students. The House system was designed to provide better communication, distributed administration, more personal attention to individuals, a smaller peer group for students, more practical social events, and intra-house athletic teams. The houses are Adams, Barry, Beals and Riley, with each year group occupying one house. In the period of its largest population (≈3,000 students in the 1960s and later), there were six houses – the two additional houses being Bacon and Palmer – which also contained student common rooms and teachers' lounges. Originally, students in the same class were broken up into different houses; now the four houses correspond to the four grade levels. Students remain in the same house throughout their four years at Newton North. Houses are named for notable former principals, such as J.N. Beals and E.D. Adams. Academics Newton North offers both traditional college-preparatory academic courses along with technical and vocational training. Traditional courses in the humanities and the sciences are streamed, often with College Prep, Advanced College Prep, Honors and Advanced Placement options. Starting with the 2014–2015 school year, course levels were renamed to College Prep (formerly CII), Advanced College Prep (formerly (CI), and Honors/Advanced Placement (no change). Non-standard courses include video production, architecture, automobile repair, and biodiesel production. Newton North held the sixth position in Boston Magazines 2010 rankings of public high schools. =Greengineering= During the academic year of 2009/2010 a Greengineering course was added in the Career and Tech. Ed. Department at Newton North High School. The course taught students how to produce biodiesel, make fused plastic bags, and grow algae that would later be processed into fuel. The biodiesel was sold to a recycling company as well as the community at large. This program was the first of its kind in both Massachusetts and the United States.Newton North Students Probe Future of Fuel, Environment , Newton Tab. Greengineering was renewed for the academic year of 2010/2011 with additions to curriculum for Greengineering 101 and a new Greengineering 201 course. They had started creating a styrofoam type material using mycelium. They planned to use it to replace the need for non-green styrofoam and to create a surfboard made of fiberglass-coated mycelium. During the 2016-2017 school year, Greengineering had multiple new subject areas including pedal power and aquaponics. However in the beginning of the 2018 school year, Greengineering came to an end and was replaced with a new Sustainability course. =Partnerships and exchanges= Students studying foreign languages have the opportunity to participate in one of several international exchange programs. In addition, Newton North participates in the Newton-Beijing Jingshan School Exchange Program.

It belongs to the Dodecanese island chain, between the islands of Kos (south, at a distance of ) and Leros (north, at a distance of less than ): the latter is linked to it through a series of islets. Kalymnos lies between two and five hours away by sea from Rhodes. In 2011 the island had a population of 16,001, making it the third most populous island of the Dodecanese, after Kos and Rhodes. It is known in Greece for the affluence of much of its population, and also stands as both the wealthiest member of the Dodecanese and one of the wealthiest Greek islands overall. The Municipality of Kalymnos, which includes the populated offshore islands of Pserimos (pop. 80), Telendos (94), Kalolimnos (2), and Pláti (2), as well as several uninhabited islets, has a combined land area of and a total population of 16,179 inhabitants.

British Museum The island is roughly rectangular in shape, with a length of and a width of , and covers an area of . Moreover, on the north side there is a peninsula which stretches in a northwest direction. Kalymnos is mostly mountainous with complicated topography. There are three main chains going from W-NW to E-SE, and a fourth which extends NW the length of the peninsula. The coastline is very irregular, with many sheltered coves. There are some springs, one among them being thermal. The soil is mainly limestone-based, but in the valleys there is a compact bank of volcanic tuff, the relic of an ancient volcano, located in Vigles, between the villages of Myrties and Kantouni. The island is mainly barren, except for the two fertile valleys of Vathys and Pothia, where olives, oranges and vines are grown. There is also an ostrich farm in Argos, near the airport. Earthquakes are a frequent occurrence around Kalymnos, a fact that is connected with the volcanoes in surrounding islands. The last earthquake occurred was the 2017 Aegean Sea earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7Mw, which injured two people in Kalymnos. Archipelago of Kalymnos Kalymnos is neighbored by the small island of Telendos, which was once part of Kalymnos, but split off after a major earthquake in 554 AD and is now separated from Kalymnos by a channel of water (about 800 m wide).Spiteri, Stephen.

Between Kalymnos and Kos lies the islet of Pserimos which is inhabited and, with an area of , is one of the largest of the lesser islands of the Dodecanese. Near Pserimos lies the islet of Platí, and about to the NE lies the small islet of Kalolimnos. History Kalymnos town hall. View of Rina, the small port of Vathys Inhabited originally by Carians, in Antiquity Kalymnos depended on Kos, and followed its history. The island's Hellenistic Temple of Apollo was excavated by the British archaeologist Charles Newton in the nineteenth century; many of the finds he made, including important epigraphic inscriptions, are in the British Museum's collection.British Museum Collection In the Middle Ages it was under the influence of the Byzantine Empire, and during the 13th century it was used by the Venetian Republic as a naval base. In 1310 it came under the control of the Knights of Rhodes, and later (mainly in 1457 and 1460) was often attacked by the Ottomans, who eventually conquered it in 1522. Unlike Rhodes and Kos, during the Ottoman period there was no Turkish immigration to Kalymnos. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Kalymnos had a total population of 9,716, consisting of 9,482 Greeks, 64 Muslims and 170 foreign citizens.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 130-131 On May 12, 1912, during the Italo-Turkish War, Kalymnos was occupied by Italian sailors of the Regia Marina. Italy took control of the island along with other islands of the Dodecanese (except Kastellorizo initially) until 1947, when the Dodecanese were finally united with mainland Greece, as part of the modern Greek state. Religion The majority of Kalymnians are Orthodox Christians. The island belongs to that small part of Greece that does not depend on the Church of Greece, but rather on the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople based in Istanbul, Turkey. Kalymnos belongs to the Metropolis of Leros, Kalymnos and Astypalaia. Sponge diving Natural sponges of Kalymnos Kalymnos is known and billed as the \\"Sponge-divers' island\\". Sponge diving has long been a common occupation on Kalymnos and sponges were the main source of income of Kalymnians, bringing wealth to the island and making it famous throughout the Mediterranean. The Kalymnians harvested sponges from the sea-bed as close as Pserimos or as far as North Africa. Early diving was done without equipment (free diving), using a harpoon.Clift, Charmian, Mermaid Singing, Bobbs-Merrill, London, 1956 Sponges are still fished individually, by hand. The Greek sponge trade was centered close in the Dodecanese, featuring Kalymnos until mid-80s, when a disease hit the eastern Mediterranean destroying a great number of sponges and damaging the sponge-fishing industry as a result. Today, Kalymnos faces a lack of sponges due to the outbreak of a disease which has decimated sponge crops. An annual celebration, Sponge Week, occurs a week after Easter to honour this \\"Kalymnian gold.” Much has been written, sung and filmed about the legendary courage and recklessness of the sponge divers themselves.  Climbing  Kalymnos is a popular rock climbing and bouldering location with more than 3000 climbing routes set in the limestone rock of the island and a climate that allows climbing all year around. The island has seen a boom in climbing related tourism since 1997, when the Italian Andrea di Bari started establishing the first routes. Economy Being mostly barren (only 18% of the land can be cultivated), agriculture has always played a minor role in the economy of the island, except for the valley of Vathi. The island is famous for its citrus fruits grown in this area. Another industrial activity typical of Kalymnos was the production of painted head scarfs, which were the most original component of the female dress. In recent times, tourism has become important for the island, particularly for rock climbing. In 2006, the island also acquired an airport, the Kalymnos Island National Airport in Argos, a village between Pothia and Brosta (the villages which are opposite of Telendos), to better link the island with the mainland. Since the beginning of the 20th century, there has been much emigration from Kalymnos (the 1925 population was some 24,000 inhabitants as compared to 16,500 in 2012), especially to the United States and Australia. The cities of Darwin and Melbourne in Australia, and Tarpon Springs, Gary, IN, and Campbell, OH in the United States are home to large Greek communities of Kalymnian descent. Kalymnian emigrants and their descendants also form a substantial portion of the bridge painting industry in the USA. Some researchers link this to the sponge diving tradition and way of life as both trades involve dangerous work with long periods away from home.

Wallis House, originally designed by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners, and in 2008 the conversion to residential development was designed by Assael Architecture. The Golden Mile is the name given to a stretch of the Great West Road north of Brentford running west from the western boundary of Chiswick in London, United Kingdom. It was so called due to the concentration of industry along this short stretch of road. This section of the Great West Road was opened in 1925 in order to bypass the notoriously congested Brentford High Street and several factories of architectural merit were rapidly built along the road to take advantage of both the good communications it provided, and the easy availability of land for new buildings. Many examples of the Art Deco architecture remain. However, no commercial buildings could be built further west along the Great West Road (A4) after Syon Lane (Gillette Corner) as the land was owned by the Church Commissioners. Syon Lane railway station was built especially for the workers at these various factories. Land for the Great West Road was compulsorily purchased. It seems likely that housing was dictated by the 1923 (and later) Housing Acts which gave house builders incentives to build houses; also the need to have workers living near the factories. These factories included: * Hudson-Essex Motors was the first factory built in the area, opening in 1926. The factory built Hudson and Essex motor cars, and later Terraplane. Further office premises were added and after the merger of Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson to form American Motors Corporation in 1954 the company became Rambler Motors Limited. Because of their close proximity to the newly built Chiswick flyover the Chiswick junction came to be known as \\"Hudsons corner.\\" Rambler Motors continued to import and service AMC cars into the 1970s.https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1992/55/60-years- terraplanehttps://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1963/37/fragments- forgotten-makes * Smith's Potato Crisps Ltd opened in 1927 (Brand now owned by PepsiCo, acquired in 1989). Factory rebuilt and expanded in 1930 with colonnaded frontage. * The Firestone Tyre Company. Built 1928, designed by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners. It was the first overseas factory built by the Firestone company of America. The building frontage was demolished during a public holiday in August 1980 shortly before a preservation order was due to be served on it to retain the Art Deco architecture. The Art Deco gatehouse was demolished in 2004 to make way for increased parking facilities. The remaining gates, railings, and piers are in a Jazz Modern style and are Grade II listed. * The Trico Products Windscreen Wiper factory, No. 980, opened in 1928. The Trico business relocated to Pontypool, South Wales in 1992 and the building was demolished. The site, together with the adjacent site, Maclean's toothpaste factory (then owned by Rank Audio-Visual) to its east, was to be used for the UK headquarters of Samsung.

The sign, showing a bottle of Lucozade emptying into a glass, was on the wall of what was the Lucozade factory, which opened in 1953 and was demolished in late 2004. The sign was removed to Gunnersbury Park Museum in September 2004 after a brief campaign to preserve it in situ. A replica was subsequently installed, then controversially removed at the end of 2015 and replaced with a digital billboard. Another memorable animated signage was of a female diver advertising Jantzen swimwear. One of the most beautiful single-storey deco buildings belonged to the Firestone Tyre Factory – painted entirely in white – which was controversially demolished one Sunday just a day before a preservation order was to be placed on it. Only the white railings at the front remain. It is now the site of the West Cross Business Centre.

He is mostly remembered for his books on the themes of childhood and adolescence. Biography Born in January 1897 in Iaşi into a family of intellectuals, Teodoreanu followed his father Osvald and older brother Păstorel in becoming a lawyer. From 1904 to 1906 he attended the German primary school of Pitar-Moş in Bucharest, until his parents moved back to Iaşi. Between 1908 and 1912 he attended the Boarding High School in Iaşi. He later transferred to the National College, which he attended until he graduated in 1916. Teodoreanu obtained his Law degree in 1919, and began to work as a lawyer, although he was more attracted to literature. In late 1918, Teodoreanu he was introduced to his future wife, Maria Ştefana Lupaşcu, by Delavrancea's daughters. The two young people became close due to their mutual passion for literature and their disposition towards writing, and they married in 1920. One year later, on February 3, 1921, he became the father of twin boys, Ştefan and Osvald. Ionel Teodoreanu died on February 3, 1954, at 57 in Bucharest. Literary works Teodoreanu made his literary debut in 1919, with the Bunicii (\\"The Grandparents\\") sketch, published in the review Însemnări literare (Literary notes). His editorial debut was represented by the short story volume Uliţa copilăriei (\\"Childhood Lane\\", 1923). Like his brother Păstorel—a renowned epigrammatist—he was linked to the Romanian Life group led by Garabet Ibrăileanu, who considered him to one of the most promising writers of the generation following World War I. In this environment, Teodoreanu published his classic novel trilogy. La Medeleni between 1925 and 1927. =La Medeleni= Teodoreanu wrote around twenty books, but his greatest success, especially with children and young people, was La Medeleni. The trilogy includes several autobiographical episodes, and, on a universal level, constitute a subtle analysis of the human soul. The trilogy is not without its critics; George Călinescu argued that Teodoreanu's style was too laden with metaphors and rather baroque. The universe of La Medeleni reflects the upper middle class environment in Romania during the early decades of the 20th century. It depicts the innocence of childhood which the ravages of the World War and its aftermath would soon shatter. Although Teodoreanu did not write it as an autobiography, his experience of having grown up in such a family in Moldavia during this time was influential. =Lorelei= Teodoreanu abandoned the childhood theme in most of his later literary works and never again reached the same level of success, but his books are still loved. In Lorelei, the main character is Luli, an eighteen-year-old student who falls in love with her teacher, Catul Bogdan, becoming engaged to him just three days after their first meeting. Bogdan is a workaholic writer, and soon Luli starts to feel abandoned and unloved. With the help of her friend, Gabriela, Luli sets to play a game with her husband. She writes some poems, and makes her friend Gabriela write them down, signing them with the psedudonym \\"Lorelei\\" and then mail them to her husband. Catul is amazed by the quality of the poems and slowly falls in love with the woman who wrote them. After a while, when Gabriela visits them, he sees a piece of paper with her writing and believes she is the mysterious \\"Lorelei\\". Luli realizes what is going on, but before this situation could be defused, dies due to an acute appendicitis. Catul later marries Gabriela, but their relationship is marred by the character faults of Gabriela. He starts having nightmares and loses his ability to write. Finally, he realizes that Gabriela is only after his money, learns the true identity of \\"Lorelei\\", and commits suicide.

The annealing temperature during a polymerase chain reaction determines the specificity of primer annealing. The melting point of the primer sets the upper limit on annealing temperature. At temperatures just above this point, only very specific base pairing between the primer and the template will occur. At lower temperatures, the primers bind less specifically. Nonspecific primer binding obscures polymerase chain reaction results, as the nonspecific sequences to which primers anneal in early steps of amplification will \\"swamp out\\" any specific sequences because of the exponential nature of polymerase amplification. Method The earliest steps of a touchdown polymerase chain reaction cycle have high annealing temperatures. The annealing temperature is decreased in increments for every subsequent set of cycles. The primer will anneal at the highest temperature which is least-permissive of nonspecific binding that it is able to tolerate. Thus, the first sequence amplified is the one between the regions of greatest primer specificity; it is most likely that this is the sequence of interest. These fragments will be further amplified during subsequent rounds at lower temperatures, and will outcompete the nonspecific sequences to which the primers may bind at those lower temperatures. If the primer initially (during the higher-temperature phases) binds to the sequence of interest, subsequent rounds of polymerase chain reaction can be performed upon the product to further amplify those fragments. Touchdown increases specificity of the reaction at higher temperatures and increases the efficiency towards the end by lowering the annealing temperature.

She made her debut to the Canadian national team at the World Archery Youth Championships in 2002, and won her first international competition in Arizona that same year, a moment she reflected in 2015 as her greatest achievement. Following the 2012 Summer Olympics Beaudet took a year's break from archery to prioritise her mental health, returning to the sport in 2014. Beaudet announced her retirement in 2015 to focus on her nursing studies at Cégep de Lévis-Lauzon. ;Olympic Games Beaudet's selection to represent Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics made her the country's youngest ever Olympic archer at seventeen years old. Beaudet won selection to the 2008 Summer Olympics in July 2008 after a successful appeal against the results of a national trial held in May, which Beaudet argued was not clarified prior to competition as the basis for Olympic selection. Beaudet entered the 2008 Games holding a world ranking of 53.

Granted internal self-government on 2 October 1972 and ruled for much of its existence by Cedric Phatudi, Lebowa was reincorporated into South Africa in 1994. It became part of the Limpopo province. The territory was not contiguous, being divided into two major and several minor portions.Lebowa - Britannica Online Even though Lebowa included large swathes of SekukunilandSekhukhuneland and was seen as a home for the Northern Sotho speaking ethnic groups such as the Pedi people, it was also home to various non-Northern Sotho speaking tribes, including the Northern Ndebele, Batswana and VaTsonga. Etymology The name \\"Lebowa\\" is an archaic spelling of the Northern Sotho word \\"leboa\\" which means \\"north\\". The name was chosen as a compromise between the various Northern Sotho groups for which it was designed. History The North Sotho National Unit was founded on 1 June 1960 in pursuance of separate development. It was created to be a homeland for Northern Sotho peoples such as Bapedi, Batlokwa, Babirwa, Banareng, Bahananwa, Balobedu, Bakone, Baroka, Bakgakga, Bahlaloga, Batau, Bakwena, Baphuthi, Batlou and many others. On 2 October 1972 it was granted internal self- governance and renamed Lebowa. http://www.worldstatesmen.org/South_African_homelands.html The first black leader of the territory was Mokgoma Maurice Matlala who was handpicked by the apartheid authorities. He first led the North Sotho National Unit as its Executive Chief Councillor from August 1969 to 2 October 1972 at which point he became the Executive Chief Minister of Lebowa. The following year of 1973 on 3 May Mokgoma's Lebowa National Party lost the first elections of the homeland to the Lebowa People's Party and Dr. Cedric Phatudi took over. He went on to win two more re-elections in 1978 and 1973 but died in his third term in 1987. ZT Seleka was announced as the interim leader of the homeland. After elections, Mogoboya Nelson Ramodike became the Executive Chief Minister until 1989 when the office became the Prime Ministry. On 24 April 1994 Nelson Ramodike resigned and the homeland had no active administration until 27 April when it was reintegrated into South Africa. The overwhelming majority of its territory became part of the newly formed province of the Northern Transvaal (now Limpopo) and a smaller portion formed the newly created Eastern Transvaal province (now Mpumalanga).

For the Smashing Pumpkins song, see Tristessa (song) Tristessa is a novella by Beat Generation writer Jack Kerouac set in Mexico City. It is based on his relationship with a Mexican prostitute (the title character). The woman's real name was Esperanza (\\"hope\\" in Spanish); Kerouac changed her name to Tristessa (\\"tristeza\\" means sadness in Spanish and Portuguese).\\"Who's Who: A Guide to Kerouac's Characters\\" Beatdom Issue 3 This novel has been translated into Spanish by Jorge García-Robles of Mexico City. Allen Ginsberg, in describing the book, wrote \\"Tristessa's a narrative meditation studying a hen, a rooster, a dove, a cat, a dog, family meat, and a ravishing, ravished junkie lady\\". In Tristessa, Kerouac attempts to sketch for the reader a picture of quiet transcendence in hectic and sometimes dangerous circumstances. He chronicles Tristessa's addiction to morphine and impoverished life with descriptions tinged with elements of her saintly beauty and her innocence. Early in the novel, Kerouac attempts to communicate his Buddhist beliefs. These beliefs become entangled as a metaphor in the unfamiliar culture and language that Kerouac tries to grasp and make contact with in the story. The self-destructive nature of her addiction contrast with the beauty of Kerouac's descriptions. Also, as a part of the study of the life of a junkie, is the character of Old Bull Gaines - Bill Garver, in real life, a long-time friend of William S. Burroughs and other writers of the Beat Generation - who serves as both dealer and healer of Tristessa when Jack is unable to be what she needs.

Lewis, by Michael White,\\"Christopher, who now lives in France, has written a vast canon of books that fill in the history of Middle-earth.\\" p.250. I Am in Fact a Hobbit, by Perry C. Bramlett, Joe R. Christopher; p. 91, \\"... it is part of Tolkien's canon of \\"juvenile writings.\\". Tolkien's works The works on Middle-earth published by Tolkien during his lifetime include The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, and The Road Goes Ever On. After Tolkien's death his son Christopher published The Silmarillion with many textual changes to knit several mostly unfinished manuscripts together as a coherent narrative. Further posthumous publications (with text more closely following Tolkien's original) include Unfinished Tales, The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, Bilbo's Last Song, and The Children of Húrin. Christopher Tolkien also published the 12-volume History of Middle-earth, containing many texts, drafts, and notes by Tolkien (both early and late), together with Christopher's own extensive notes placing these in context. Further works authorized by the Tolkien Literary Estate include The History of The Hobbit in two volumes by John Rateliff and The Annotated Hobbit by Douglas Anderson, both with notes and early drafts by Tolkien. Linguistic material by Tolkien concerning Middle-earth has also been published with the permission of the Estate in two periodical publications.Manuscripts by Tolkien, by Jason Fisher in J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment, edited by Michael D.C. Drout: 'In addition to these invaluable works, there is an ongoing process, still underway today, to collate, edit, and publish the large body of Tolkien's unpublished linguistic writings. This project, headed up by Christopher Gilson, with the assistance of such Tolkien linguistic scholars as Carl F. Hostetter, Arden R. Smith, and Patrick Wynne, has already resulted in the addition of considerable new material to the published canon (in the forms of the journals Parma Eldalamberon and Vinyar Tengwar).' (emphasis added). The Qenya and Gnomish Lexicons, in full, appear in Parma Eldalamberon Numbers 11–16; other mostly self-contained fragments, notes, and poems appear in various issues of Vinyar Tengwar. All of this material together constitutes a collection which, much like real-world histories and mythologies, contains numerous points of obscurity, omission, or apparent contradiction. = The Hobbit = Although Tolkien said that The Hobbit was conceived separately from his mythological stories,Carpenter, Humphrey, editor, The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, George Allen and Unwin, 1981, , Letter 163, Tolkien to W. H. Auden: \\"The Hobbit was originally quite unconnected, though it inevitably got drawn in to the circumference of the greater construction...\\" early drafts show that it was set in that world, referring explicitly to characters and places which appeared in his Book of Lost Tales which would later become The Silmarillion. The Necromancer was originally Thû, the precursor of Sauron; Thorin's grandfather was imprisoned in the same dungeons that held Beren and Lúthien; the Elven king was Thingol and his land Menegroth.Rateliff, John D. (2007). The History of the Hobbit. London: HarperCollins. . p. 83, (characters and History) p. 17 (geography). When he revised The Hobbit to bring the story of the finding of the Ring in line with The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien retained the original version as the tale Bilbo told to justify his acquisition of the Ring. = The Lord of the Rings = The Lord of the Rings picks up the story of The Hobbit some sixty years later, with some of the same locations and characters. Tolkien now explicitly linked the story to the Silmarillion tales, but placed it some six thousand years later in time. This reframing made some details in The Hobbit, such as the goblins' ready recognition of the ancient swords Orcrist and Glamdring, difficult to reconcile into a single history. Other details from The Hobbit don't quite mesh with The Lord of the Rings. Frodo and his companions, for example, cover much the same territory in the Trollshaws as Bilbo and the Dwarves, but take much longer to reach Rivendell, and the geography is described differently.Fonstad, Karen Wynn. The Atlas of Middle-earth, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1981, , p.97 Several adjustments to The Hobbit only increased the discrepancies; and in the 1960s, Tolkien began rewriting The Hobbit more in the style and tone of The Lord of the Rings, adjusting the journey and landmarks to fit the later story, but ultimately abandoned the effort. = Writings after The Lord of the Rings = According to Christopher Tolkien, despite J.R.R. Tolkien's desire to bring the older Silmarillion stories to a publishable state, much time was spent instead trying to bring consistency to the works already published.J. R. R. Tolkien; Christopher Tolkien, editor, The History of Middle-earth, Vol. XII, p. ix, C. Tolkien: \\"... whereas my father set a great store by consistency at all points with The Lord of the Rings and the Appendices, so little concerning the First Age had appeared in print that he was under far less constraint.\\" The unpublished manuscripts were left in various states of completion. These older stories had existed and changed over many decades, partly in response to The Lord of the Rings; as he reworked the material, he made substantial changes, up to and including the abandonment of major themes and entire tales, and wholesale rewrites and revisions of otherwise seemingly complete narratives. Towards the end of his life, the focus of Tolkien's writing shifted from story telling inspired by his philological pursuitsTolkien, J. R. R., edited by Christopher Tolkien, The Monsters and the Critics, Boston, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1984, 'Secret Vice', p.211, \\"...your language construction will breed a mythology.\\" Also, Carpenter, Humphrey, editor, The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, George Allen and Unwin, 1981, , Letter 257, \\"The germ of my attempt to write legends to fit my private languages...\\"(emphasis added). Letter 163, \\"All this only as background to the stories, though languages and names are for me are inextricable from the stories. They are and were so to speak an attempt to give a background or a world in which my expressions of linguistic taste could have a function.\\" to more philosophical concerns, and Tolkien never finished a unified, systematic, and internally consistent narrative. = The Silmarillion compilation = The Silmarillion was compiled by Christopher Tolkien (who was long involved in J. R. R. Tolkien's creative process) and published in 1977, four years after Tolkien’s death. It presents an abridged cycle of Tolkien's drafts of his Elvish legends, drawing material from the earliest Book of Lost Tales to drafts written long after The Lord of the Rings. Most of the original texts have subsequently appeared in the History of Middle-earth. Christopher's goal was a version resembling what he thought at the time his father might have produced. Christopher observed that absolute consistency among the Middle-earth tales could only be achieved by losing much that was good in them: > \\"a complete consistency (either within the compass of The Silmarillion > itself or between The Silmarillion and other published writings of my > father's) is not to be looked for, and could only be achieved, if at all, at > heavy and needless cost.\\"The Silmarillion, p.8 He went on to say: > \\"My father came to conceive The Silmarillion as a compilation... and it is > to some extent a compendium in fact and not only in theory.\\" Throughout his commentaries in Unfinished Tales and the twelve volumes of The History of Middle-earth, Christopher Tolkien points out differences between various versions of the original texts and the final editorial selections and occasional alterations in The Silmarillion. In the Introduction of Unfinished Tales he observes that such selection was necessary to publishing a unified narrative;Unfinished Tales, Introduction, p. 1 but in some cases he later came to feel that he went too far, for example in the ruin of Doriath: > \\"I think now that this was a mistaken view, and that the undoubted > difficulties could have been and should have been, surmounted without so far > overstepping the bounds of editorial function.\\" History of Middle-earth Vol. > XI, p.356 Editing for consistency can be seen by comparing the chapter \\"Of the Voyage of Eärendil\\" in The Silmarillion with its corresponding section in the History of Middle-earth Volume V (The Lost Road and Other Writings). The Quenta Silmarillion of the 1930s was Tolkien's final text for this section, and Christopher carried it forward into The Silmarillion nearly word for word with editorial modifications—for consistency with other works—primarily limited to nomenclature: Fionwë edited to Eönwë, Lindar to Vanyar, etc. For example: > From The Silmarillion: \\"In the front of that fire came Glaurung the golden, > father of dragons, in his full might; and in his train were Balrogs, and > behind them came the black armies of the Orcs in multitudes such as the > Noldor had never before seen or imagined.\\" — p. 151. > From The Lost Road: \\"In the front of that fire came Glómund the golden, the > father of dragons, and in his train were Balrogs, and behind them came the > black armies of the Orcs in multitudes such as the Gnomes had never before > seen or imagined.\\" — p. 280. = The Children of Húrin = Alan Lee signs The Children of Húrin at Forbidden Planet, London In the continuing development of the published history of Middle-earth, Christopher Tolkien quotes in The Children of Húrin his father's own words on his fictional universe: > \\"once upon a time... I had in mind to make a body of more or less connected > legend... I would draw some of the great tales in fullness, and leave many > only placed in the scheme, and sketched.\\"J R R Tolkien, edited by > Christopher Tolkien, The Children of Húrin, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 2007. > , p.9 Christopher Tolkien offers this justification for exercising his editorial authority to produce The Children of Húrin as a separate book: > \\"...it has seemed to me that there was a good case for presenting my > father's long version of the legend of the Children of Húrin as an > independent work, between its own covers, with a minimum of editorial > presence, and above all in continuous narrative without gaps or > interruptions, if this could be done without distortion or invention, > despite the unfinished state in which he left parts of it.\\"J.R.R. Tolkien, > Christopher Tolkien, editor, The Children of Húrin, p.7 Ethan Gilsdorf reviewing The Children of Húrin wrote of the editorial function: > \\"Of almost equal interest is Christopher Tolkien's task editing his father's > abandoned projects. In his appendix, he explains his editorial process this > way: \\"While I have had to introduce bridging passages here and there in the > piecing together of different drafts, there is no element of extraneous > 'invention' of any kind, however slight.\\" He was criticized for having > monkeyed with his father's text when putting \\"The Silmarillion\\" together. > This pre-emptive strike must be meant to allay the fears of Tolkien's most > persnickety readers.\\"The Boston Globe Book Review of The Children of Húrin > by Ethan Gilsdorf, April 26, 2007. =Beren and Lúthien= Tolkien’s manuscripts are presented as a fully continuous and standalone story, with a single narrative. =The Fall of Gondolin= Originally a short story, a book-length version was published in 2018. Christoper Tolkien stated in its Preface that this would be the last work he would edit for publication. Fictional canon for Middle-earth As a result of the manner of its creation, the secondary world of Middle-earth is complicated. Its creator developed various elements of his fiction over the course of decades, making substantial changes including the abandonment of major themes, facts and entire tales, and undertook wholesale rewrites and revisions of otherwise \\"complete\\" narratives. The author's opinions on the relationships of his texts to each other often changed. In his letters, Tolkien comments upon the intertextual relationships of his works: > \\"I am doubtful myself about the undertaking [of finishing The Silmarillion]. > Part of the attraction of the L.R. [The Lord of the Rings] is, I think, due > to the glimpses of a large history in the background: an attraction like > that of viewing far off an unvisited island, or seeing the towers of a > distant city gleaming in a sunlit mist. To go there is to destroy the magic, > unless new unattainable vistas are again revealed.\\"Tolkien, Letters, ed. > Humphrey Carpenter, Letter #247. The quest by some readers for a consistent fictional canon within some subset of Tolkien's writings was noted by Verlyn Flieger. Since the degree of narrative consistency that might be expected from a series of novels is not always found in Tolkien's work, Flieger attributed the need on the part of some readers to find consistency within the stories to the sense of reality that Tolkien strove to instil in his work, although the search for a definitive fictional canon has been seen as ultimately irrelevant to appreciation of his tales. The desire for a Middle-earth canon arises from the need of some readers to form an internal consistency between the stories, a need related to their \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\".Sammons, Martha C., A Guide Through Narnia, Regent College Publishing 2nd ed., 2004 : \\"A key quality to this other world is believability. Tolkien insists that the secondary world should be presented as true, with an inner consistency of reality, internal logic, and laws that make things explainable. ... Lewis on the other hand, says the writer needs to put only enough science in the story to create a 'willing suspension of disbelief.'\\"Haase, Donald, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales, Greenwood Press, 2008, , p. 331: \\"Tolkien's concept of fantasy literature ... is based on the suspension of disbelief.\\" Tolkien, in his essay \\"On Fairy Stories\\", claimed that no individual fantasy story can be successful without maintaining an \\"inner consistency of reality\\".Tolkien, J.

Bank Street Sparks Street (French: Rue Sparks) is a pedestrian mall in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was a main street in Ottawa that was converted into an outdoor pedestrian street in 1967, making it the earliest such street or mall in Canada.ottawakiosk city guide , retrieved 19 August 2012 Sparks runs from Elgin Street in the east to Bronson Avenue. The Sparks Street Mall, that contains a number of outdoor restaurants and also a number of works of art and fountains, only runs from Elgin to Bank Street. The pedestrian-only portion continues for another two blocks westward, with the final two blocks west of Lyon Street being a regular road and merges into Bronson Avenue going south. The mall and most of the buildings on the south side are owned and operated by the National Capital Commission. Buildings on the north side of the mall were expropriated by the Government of Canada in 1973 and are currently operated by Public Works and Government Services Canada. History Sparks Street in 1909. Located one block south of Wellington Street (the home of the Parliament of Canada), Sparks Street is one of Ottawa's more historic streets with a number of heritage buildings. The street is named after Nicholas Sparks, the farmer who, early in the mid- nineteenth century, cut a path through the woods on his holding that would eventually become the street. Sparks Street in 1901 When Ottawa was selected as Canada's capital, the area became even more important as the street became home to a number of government offices and homes for parliamentarians. One of these was Thomas D'Arcy McGee who, in 1868, was assassinated outside his home at the corner of Sparks and Metcalfe. The street also became Ottawa's commercial hub in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was home to a number of the city's banks and the lumber companies of the Ottawa Valley, as well as \\"the best shops, hotels, dining rooms, and theatres.\\". It once contained the Murphy-Gamble (later Simpson's), Morgan's, C.Ross, and Bryson- Graham's department stores. The peak of the street was in the early twentieth century when a number of Beaux-Arts buildings that still stand were erected. At the time, the eastern end of Sparks Street continued across the Rideau Canal on Sappers Bridge. Where the War Memorial and Confederation Square stands today, was the Russell House hotel, and Ottawa's old Post Office. The square was built in the 1930s. As the city expanded, the downtown became less centralized and commerce spread to neighbouring streets. Government ministries, requiring larger offices, also went elsewhere. In 1959, the street's streetcar line was closed. =Pedestrian mall= Starting in 1960 the street was closed to traffic in the summers in an attempt to improve commerce. This plan was modelled on Toledo, Ohio, which along with Kalamazoo were the first North American cities to close downtown streets in an attempt to recapture customers. The success of these temporary summer closings convinced the city to close the street permanently to vehicles in 1967. Although initially successful, the mall began to decline in the 1970s. Urban planning professor David Gordon, of Queen's University, blames the growth of suburban shopping malls. Another major problem was the growth of high rise government offices with internal concourses in the area. Gordan and Bray wrote that Sparks became \\"an isolated island of pedestrian-friendly space in a traffic- dominated district\\" in a 2003 report. Additionally, the Government of Canada is a major landlord on the street, its buildings presenting a \\"blank face\\" to the street, and discouraging shops from investing in the area long-term. Today, the pedestrian mall is open year-round and extends from Elgin to Kent Streets. While the mall is quite busy during weekdays, it is only lightly used during weekends. The National Capital Commission remains committed to operating and improving the mall. The street's landscaping has been updated. The Commission was successful in bringing the CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre to a location on the mall and is seeking to increase business and activity by increasing the number of residences nearby. However, the CBC development has been criticized as \\"just another low-cost, banal building\\" which was designed poorly and has not brought more life to the street. Councillor Diane Holmes called it \\"the biggest disappointment,\\" and \\"a whole block of deadness.\\" Events Sparks Street is home to the Sparks Street International Chicken & Rib Cook-off every year in late June. Each year, around the August civic holiday, Sparks street plays host to the Ottawa International Buskers Festival, where buskers from around the world come to showcase their art to tourists and locals in downtown Ottawa. Latin Sparks Festival made its debut in 2012 as a small group of 40 friends gathered weekly on Sparks Street to dance outdoors in the summertime. Sparks Street is home to Latin Sparks Festival since 2012, featuring music, dancing and food. Landmarks 'Joy' copper sculpture at Sparks Street. Bruce Garner, 1970. Sparks contains some of Ottawa's most important structures. Just past the eastern end of Sparks at Elgin Street is the National War Memorial and across Elgin from Sparks is the National Arts Centre. The eastern section of the street sees a number of the oldest buildings, including Ottawa's post office from 1939; the Ottawa Electric Building, built in 1926 by the founders of the Ottawa Electric Railway, Ottawa's streetcar system, Ottawa's first high-rise: the Bible House/old James Hope building at 61 Sparks, built in 1910; and branches of a number of Canada's banks from the same era. A pair of notable newer buildings are also on this section of the mall, including the CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre and the Thomas D'Arcy McGee Building, which is located at the corner of Metcalfe and Sparks. West of Bank Street, outside of the mall itself, the street is overshadowed by the C.D. Howe Building, the home of Industry Canada on the south and the headquarters of the Bank of Canada to the north. West of the bank is the Ottawa Marriott Hotel and Place de Ville's Podium Building and Tower C, the tallest building in Ottawa and home of Transport Canada. On the north side, home of the Department of Justice in the St. Andrew's Towers and the East Memorial Building with other government departments in the West Memorial Building. West of these buildings the street becomes far less notable as being home to several hotels and smaller buildings. The final block of the rather short street has the Garden of the Provinces and Territories to the north and Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa's main Anglican church, to the south. One of the best known addresses in all of Canada for many years was \\"56 Sparks Street, Ottawa\\" as it was the tag line used in a large number of radio and television commercials and commentaries made by Lotta Hitschmanova, the founder of the humanitarian charity USC Canada which moved to an office at 56 Sparks Street soon after it was created in 1945.Dan Conlin, \\"Lotta Hitschmanova's Uniform\\", Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 Transit access On September 14, 2019, the O-Train's Confederation Line was opened, under Queen Street and one block south of Sparks.

Early life Born in Ga- Mphahlele, Phatudi grew up around the area that later became the capital of the homeland he led. He earned his basic education in village schools. Education Phatudi initially worked as a teacher and educational administrator before attending the University of Fort Hare, gaining a BA in 1947 and a teaching diploma in 1950 at the University of Witwatersrand, graduating with a BEd in 1965. It was during this time that he made his contributions to the Sepedi language. He authored and co-authored a few books in Sepedi. He is also known to have translated some of Shakespeare's works into Sepedi. Books: Lehlabile Series, co-authored with G.O. Mojapelo : , published by Educum. He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of the North in 1973, after which Phatudi encouraged others to use the Dr prefix wherever possible when referring to him. Phatudi served as President of the Federation of Inspectors of Schools in South Africa from 1958 to 1969. Chief Minister of Lebowa Phatudi became involved in the nascent Lebowa nation building exercise and had risen in prominence to the extent that when Lebowa was granted self-government on 2 October 1972, Phatudi was appointed Minister for Education before his election as Chief Minister on 8 May 1973. Not one for wasting time settling into the role, Phatudi had been Chief Minister for one day when he informed the South African government that if Lebowa was to become self-sufficient then substantial tracts of South Africa, including a number of white towns, would need to be added to Lebowa territory. The statement was not well received in Pretoria, although they did eventually transfer several small tracts of land to Lebowa. The earlier outburst aside, Phatudi was considered the most tactful of the bantustan leaders, with a modus operandi directed more at calm negotiations with Pretoria and dissident bodies than the angry outbursts epitomised by leaders like the Transkei's Kaiser Matanzima. However, when these failed, Phatudi was not above unleashing his police against political opponents. Economic problems continued to plague Lebowa however and Phatudi struggled to maintain control over the increasingly disgruntled homeland population throughout his rule. Phatudi died in office in 1987; Lebowa itself only lasted another seven years before its reintegration into Transvaal. Phatudi, also successfully negotiated that Es'kia Mphahlele who was then a prohibited person, be allowed back into the country. After this success, he later also attempted to negotiate the release of Nelson Mandela, but unfortunately this was not realised.http://www.historicalpapers.wits.ac.za/inventories/inv_pdfo/AK2117/AK2117-J7-DA2-001-jpeg.pdf References External links Category:1912 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Northern Sotho people Category:Chief ministers of South African bantustans Category:University of Fort Hare alumni Category:University of the Witwatersrand alumni ","title":"Cedric Phatudi"},{"id":"913692","text":"Nicholas Sparks (b. 1965) is an American author.

It was once considered to be allied to the turnstones, and placed in the monotypic genus Aphriza, but is now placed in the genus Calidris. This bird has a short dark bill, yellow legs and a black band at the end of the white rump. In breeding plumage, it has dark streaks on the brownish head and breast with dark spots on its white underparts; the upperparts are dark with rust colouring on the wings. Birds in winter plumage and immature birds are mainly grey on the upperparts and breast and white on the underparts with streaking. Their breeding habitat is rocky tundra areas in Alaska and the Yukon. The female lays 4 eggs in a depression on the ground lined with vegetation. Both parents look after the young birds, who feed themselves. These birds migrate to the Pacific coasts of North and South America, from southern Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. On the nesting grounds, these birds mainly eat insects and some seeds. At other times of year, they eat mollusks and crustaceans found along the surf line on rocky coasts and are usually found in small flocks, often with turnstones. The song is a whistled tee tee tee. Discovery and taxonomy The surfbird was described by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 based on a specimen collected in Prince William Sound during Captain Cook's visit to Alaska in 1788. Gmelin originally placed the species in the genus Tringa, but it was moved to a monotypic genus, Aphriza, in 1839 by the American naturalist John James Audubon. The species was long thought to be allied to the turnstones, and placed in the subfamily Arenariinae. With the turnstones it has even been treated as its own family. More recent data suggests it is very close genetically to the red and great knots and should be included in Calidris. Indeed, the great knot looks very much like a larger, longer-billed, and somewhat darker surfbird. The species is monotypic, meaning it has no subspecies. Surfbird in Humboldt County, California. Description Surfbirds in winter plumage with a ruddy turnstone (left), black-bellied plover (second from left) and black turnstones (back). The surfbird is a large sandpiper, reminiscent of the turnstones or the great knot. It measures and weighs . The sexes look the same, but the females are slightly larger than males on average. Surfbirds their breeding plumage from March through August, and have white heads, necks breast and belly which are streaked with black, except for the which are rusty. The streaking becomes less prominent lower in the body. Distribution and habitat Non-breeding surfbirds feed in the spray zone of rocky shores. The surfbird has the longest and narrowest non-breeding distribution of any North American bird, being found from Kodiak Island in Alaska to the Straits of Magellan at the southern tip of South America. Along that range it is rarely found more than a few meters from the shore. During the breeding season it is found on the mountains of Alaska and the western Yukon, from . The surfbird starts leaving its breeding grounds from July (the last leaving in October), and begins reaching its main wintering grounds in Chile and Peru in mid August. On its return migration it begins to leave South America in early March. Some birds remain on the wintering grounds year-round. Vagrant birds have been seen in the Falkland Islands, Florida, and Texas. The migration routes are almost entirely coastal, a very small number of birds have been seen inland during migration. Its breeding habitat is alpine tundra, preferably rocky ridges dominated by scree, rock fields, lichens, dwarf shrubs and Dryas (mountain avens), and less commonly in tundra with mosses and sedges. It is generally found away from suitable habitat that is close to forest. In the non breeding season, it is a rocky shore specialist, feeding on rocky shores, reefs, and ledges on the coast. It will feed from the spray zone on the water's edge to just above the tide line. In some circumstances, it will feed on sandy beaches and mudflats near rocky areas. Behavior =Diet and feeding= The diet of breeding surfbirds is dominated by insects. On one study examining stomach contents, flies (Diptera), including eggs, pupae and adults, composed 55% of the food taken by surfbirds, and beetles Coleoptera 36%. Other insects taken include moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) and bees and wasps (Hymenoptera). Seeds and snails are also taken, albeit rarely. =Breeding= Surfbird on its nest The breeding behavior of the surfbird is poorly known. The surfbird arrives in its breeding habitat in early May; due to high winds in their exposed nesting areas the snow has usually cleared by then. Nesting sites are typically on north or west facing slopes. Nests are exposed, and a re simple depressions lined with lichens and, sometimes, Dryas. The species is assumed to be territorial and monogamous. Clutch size is usually four eggs, although smaller clutches have been found. The eggs are buff-colored with gray or purple markings, and measure . Both sexes incubate the eggs and the incubation period is estimated to be between 22 and 24 days.

The family lived on tribal lands near Eufaula, Oklahoma. After the move, Gilcrease's father ran a cotton gin in the nearby community of Mounds, Oklahoma. Gilcrease's early education was limited, and took place in one-room schools in Indian Territory. As a boy, he was often called \\"Indian Tom.\\"Self, Burl E. \\"Gilcrease, William Thomas (1890 - 1962)\\"; Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture; Oklahoma Historical Society; retrieved May 28, 2015. Gilcrease attended Bacone College, where his most influential teacher was Alexander Posey, who taught his students the arts, sciences, writing, and about their American Indian heritage. The latter included learning of the Trail of Tears and important American Indian leaders, such as Sequoyah and Sitting Bull. Also, instruction on how to make bows and arrows and to hunt, and about the operations of the Creek National Council at Okmulgee. After Bacone College, Gilcrease enrolled in the Kansas State Teacher's College (renamed in 1974 to Emporia State University) at Emporia, Kansas. At the turn of the 20th century, the federal government dissolved the Indian Nations land by distributing parcels into private ownership. At age nine, Gilcrease's 1/8 Creek heritage entitled him to receive 160 acres (650,000 m²), located about twenty miles (32 km) southwest of Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1905, drillers struck oil in the area. His land, sitting astride the huge Glenn Pool Oil Reserve, made Gilcrease a multi-millionaire by the time he was twenty. Though he struggled early in his career, he proved to be an astute businessman. He founded the Gilcrease Oil Company in 1922, and with early successes, was able to purchase more land. Gilcrease established his company headquarters in San Antonio, Texas in 1937 and also maintained an office in Europe. In 1949, the headquarters of the company moved to Tulsa. =Family= On August 22, 1908, Gilcrease married Belle M. Harlow, a member of the Osage Nation. He fathered two sons with Belle: William Thomas Gilcrease, Jr., who was born on July 23, 1909 in Oklahoma and died on March 16, 1967 in Nacogdoches, Nacogdoches County, Texas, and Barton Eugene Gilcrease, who was born on April 12, 1911 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and died on September 25, 1991 in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The couple's marriage ended in divorce in 1924. On September 3, 1928, he married 19-year-old Norma Des Cygnet Smallwood, the former Miss Tulsa and Miss America 1926.Jackson, Debbie and Hilary Pittman. \\"Throwback Tulsa: Ex- Miss America's divorce case scandalized Tulsa in '34,\\" Tulsa World, May 28, 2015. Accessed May 28, 2015. Thomas Gilcrease Sr. and Norma (Smallwood) Gilcrease were the parents of one daughter, Des Cygne Lamour Gilcrease. She was born on June 12, 1929, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Thomas Gilcrease, Sr. filed for divorce in October, 1933, for extreme cruelty and gross neglect of duty. He alleged that the couple had been happily married for two years, until Norma's mother, Mahala Dickerson had moved into the house with them and alienated the affections of both Norma and the couple's daughter. He wanted the mother-in- law removed from the property.Lester, Terrell. \\"Reigning Queen // Former Tulsan Won 1926 Miss America Title.\\" Tulsa World. April 6, 1997. Accessed November 6, 2016. The Gilcrease-Smallwood marriage ended in divorce on May 2, 1934. Initially, the divorce provided for $72,000 alimony, payable at the rate of $200 per month, but with a provision that all payments would cease if Norma were to remarry. Norma balked at the provision against remarriage, so the court set alimony at $15,000, to be paid at $250 per month. During the 1920s and 1930s Gilcrease became inspired by the collections of European art museums. He began to collect oil paintings and other artifacts of the American West in 1922. The Gilcrease collection expanded over the next 20 years, with the majority obtained after 1939. In 1946, Gilcrease was honored by the Sioux Nation, made an honorary tribal member and given the name Wicarpi Wakatuya, which means \\"High Star\\". Declining oil prices in the 1950s created financial difficulties for Gilcrease. Although his oil income was not insubstantial, major collection purchases limited his cash flow and placed him in a position of being unable to meet his current debt. Concerned about the integrity of his collection, Gilcrease offered it for sale as a unit in 1954. Swift action by the people of Tulsa enabled the debt to be covered by a local bond issue, and the collection remained in Oklahoma. Thomas Gilcrease died of a heart attack on May 6, 1962. After a funeral service based on traditional Indian rites, he was buried in a mausoleum on the grounds of his estate, where his mother was buried after her death on June 11, 1935.  Art collection  Charles M. Russell, \\"When Sioux and Blackfeet Meet\\", 1903. Watercolor and opaque watercolor on paper. Gilcrease Museum collection The Gilcrease collection of American art, Native American art, artifacts, and documents was acquired over a lifetime. Gilcrease began to collect oil paintings and artifacts of the American West in 1922. At a time when few were interested in Native American or Western painting and sculptor, Gilcrease supported a number of Oklahoma artists, including Woody Crumbo (Potawatomi) and Acee Blue Eagle (Muscogee Creek) and Willard Stone, each of whom created works held in the collection. In 1943, Gilcrease moved to San Antonio and opened the Museum of the American Indian, also known as the Gilcrease Museum. However, the San Antonio site failed to attract a large number of visitors. In 1947, he purchased the entire collection of the late Phillip Gillette Cole, an avid New York collector. The collection contained 21 bronzes and 46 paintings by Charles Marion Russell, 17 bronzes and 12 paintings by Frederic Remington, photographs by Edward Curtis, and documents and correspondence of well-known figures in the American West. Gilcrease hired architect Alexandre Hogue to design a museum to be placed on Oklahoma property he had purchased in 1914. In 1949, he opened the Thomas Gilcrease Institute of American History and Art on this estate. During the remainder of his life, Gilcrease lived in an adjacent home, built of local sandstone. The rock home, dating from approximately 1912, had been extensively remodeled over the years and was surrounded by a garden specializing in plants used by local tribes. In 1954, fearing that Gilcrease Museum would be sold and leave Tulsa, a small group of citizens organized a bond election. Tulsa's citizens approved, by a 3-to-1 margin, the $2.25 million bond issue which paid Gilcrease's outstanding debts. In response, Gilcrease deeded his entire collection to the City of Tulsa in 1955, and conveyed the museum buildings and grounds to the city in 1958. In addition, Gilcrease committed oil property revenue to Tulsa for museum maintenance until the bond was fully repaid. After the transfer of the collection, Gilcrease continued to fund archaeological excavations and acquire additional materials. These materials were bequeathed to the museum upon his death in Tulsa on May 6, 1962. Gilcrease's funeral was conducted in a manner that honored his Native heritage, with Chief Wolf Robe Hunt of the Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico leading the prayer. Arrows then were shot into the air to protect Gilcrease's spirit from evil during its travel to Sha-Pa-Po, the world beyond. Cornmeal was sprinkled at the site to provide food for the spirit's journey. Gilcrease's body was buried in a mausoleum on the grounds of his home and museum.  The Gilcrease Institute  The Gilcrease Institute of American History and Art, now called the Gilcrease Museum, holds what is considered among the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of fine art, artifacts, and archives dealing with the American West. Located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Institute grounds display of thematic gardens showcasing the gardening styles of different time periods in the American West.

They set up a committee to negotiate from Lenni Lenape Native Americans for the purchase of the Horseneck Tract which today includes Livingston and eight other northern municipalities. Between 1698 and 1702, the rules for property ownership were unclear. There were many disputes between settlers and the English proprietors. For some unknown reasons, the Newark settlers did not obtain a grant from the proprietors before negotiating with the natives. They finally obtained the deed directly from Lenni Lenape in 1702 for £130. The settlements began until around the 1740s as the dispute between the proprietors and the settlers continued.James Hoyt, The Mountain society:\\" a history of the First Presbyterian Church, Orange, N. J., New York, C. M. Saxton, Barker, 1860, p.43 The dispute came to a breaking point in September 1745 when the East Jersey proprietors began to evict a settler only six months after a house fire in Newark completely destroyed the original deed, which was the only evidence of the purchase.Max K. Vorwerk, A History of the Horseneck Riots, Caldwell Bicentennial Committee, Caldwell, New Jersey, 1948 During that period, William Livingston who was one of the few landed aristocrats joined the settlers against the proprietors. Livingston owned land around today's south western corner of the Township of Livingston. His land, like other settlers, was levied with quit rents in the amount 40 shillings per acre. He defended many settlers who were jailed for refusing to pay the quit rents.Livingston Township's Namesake: William Livingston, First Governor of New Jersey, West Essex Tribune, August 25, 2011, p.B-8 This series of events caused the settlers, led by Timothy Meeker, to form a group to riot against the British government. The Horseneck Riots lasted for 10 years from 1745 to 1755. The group was also one of the first colonial militia which had periodic battles for 32 years leading up to the Revolutionary War as the group joined the Continental Army in 1776.A Brief History Of Livingston, New Jersey, West Essex Tribune, August 27, 2009, p.A-10 After the American Revolutionary War, more permanent settlements took place with the first school built in 1783. In 1811, a petition was filed to incorporate the township from about 100 people who lived in seven distinct areas: Centerville (separated to become Roseland, in 1908), Cheapside (now Livingston Mall), Morehousetown (now Livingston Circle), Northfield (now Northfield Center), Squiretown (now the Cerebral Palsy Institute of New Jersey on Old Road), Teedtown (now Livingston Center), and Washington Place (now near the border with Millburn). On February 5, 1813, the township was officially incorporated. The first town meeting was held on the same day and they decided to run the township by a Township Committee system. During the 1800s, lumber and farming were major industries in the town. Shoemaking and dairy farming became major industries during and after the Civil War. However, the population grew slowly because it was not easily accessible. Mt. Pleasant Avenue – which was one of the first turnpikes in New Jersey – was the only primary access to the town through stagecoaches. The population grew quickly after the 1920s when automobiles became more accessible. As a suburb of Newark, the town experienced many housing developments especially after World War II with its peak in 1970 of more than thirty thousand residents. During this growth period, many services were organized including volunteer Fire Department in 1922, first regular police chief in 1929, a Planning Commission in 1930, two hospitals opened in 1959 and 1960, new public library in 1961, and new municipal complex in 1963.

The organization has been instrumental in the dismantling of mainline Protestant denominations in the United States including the United Methodist Church. Founded in 1981, the institute's primary focus through the 1980s was communism and their opposition to elements within mainline Protestantism that they perceived as supportive of communism. In more recent years, the IRD has turned their main purposes to the promotion of theological and political conservatism in mainline churches, particularly on issues of sexual morality, the sanctity of human life, and in support of Israel. Background The IRD was founded in 1981 by United Methodist evangelist Edmund Robb and AFL–CIO official David Jessup. Michael Novak and Richard John Neuhaus joined the IRD board early on, as did Christianity Today founding editor Carl F. H. Henry. Mark Tooley became IRD's president in 2009. The early focus of IRD was to identify Marxist tendencies in mainline Protestant churches and draw attention to attacks on religious liberty. IRD challenged churches that supported Marxist regimes such as the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua and Vietnam in the 1980s. In 1985, IRD co-sponsored a conference with Ronald Reagan's administration, where speakers criticised the National Council of Churches for its efforts to develop contacts with church leaders in the Soviet Union. Since the early 1990s, the IRD has actively urged American churches to affirm traditional Christian sexual ethical teachings, including opposition to same-sex marriage. IRD has also challenged mainline Protestant church agencies that support abortion rights. International religious liberty is a chief concern for the IRD, and their religious liberty program has especially focused on southern Sudan. Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, IRD has emphasized the importance of Christian just war teachings. Most recently, IRD has challenged church officials who they say uncritically accept worst-case scenarios regarding human-induced climate change. The IRD focuses much of its attention on the policies of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church (USA). Notable members of the organization's board of directors include journalist Fred Barnes, United Methodist theologian Thomas C. Oden, Princeton University ethicist Robert P. George, theologian Michael Novak and former papal biographer George Weigel. Criticism Chuck Currie, a progressive minister in the United Church of Christ, blogged that \\"IRD's conservative social-policy goals include increasing military spending and foreign interventions, opposing environmental protection efforts, and eliminating social welfare programs\\" and that the organization is non- religious in nature and a front for conservative political groups that hope to undermine Christian voices opposed to conservative public policies. The IRD's self-stated goals are, \\"working to reaffirm the church's biblical and historical teachings, strengthen and reform its role in public life, protect religious freedom, and renew democracy at home and abroad.\\"https://theird.org/about/our-mission/ In their book Steeplejacking: How the Christian Right is Hijacking Mainstream Religion, United Church of Christ associate conference ministers John Dorhauer and Sheldon Culver accused the IRD of encouraging small groups of theologically conservative Christians to divide and then take over their mainline (UCC, Episcopalian and Presbyterian Church [USA]) congregations and lead them out of their respective denominations and into more conservative ones. The process, which they called \\"steeplejacking\\", is allegedly done against the wishes of the majority of the original congregants. Though the authors of \\"Steeplejacking\\" point to a number of historical instances and facts to bolster their central argument, the IRD disputes this characterization of their activities and instead suggests that much of the book is based on circumstantial evidence, observations, and experience.https://juicyecumenism.com/2007/07/09/commentary-steeplejacking- ird-critics-weigh-in/ Funding The IRD is funded by gifts from both foundations and individuals. IRD's board includes Roman Catholics. According to GuideStar, the Institute on Religion and Democracy generated $1.1 million in contributions in 2009. Donors include the Scaife Foundations, the Bradley Foundation, the Olin Foundation and Howard and Roberta Ahmanson's Fieldstead & Company.

Hillel at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, the first Hillel in the world, in its current building built in 2008 In 1923, Edward Chauncey Baldwin, Christian professor of Biblical literature at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign was distressed by his Jewish students' lack of knowledge of the Hebrew Bible, and he discussed his concerns with Rabbi Benjamin Frankel.Spiegel, Irving. \\"Faculty Program Begun by Hillel: 'More Positive Interest' in Judaism Sought by Group: How Hillel Was Founded\\". The New York Times. June 24, 1963. p. 17. Later the same year, members of the local Jewish and university communities met in a rented loft over a dry cleaner in Champaign, Illinois, and founded The Hillel Foundation.History . Illini Hillel. In 1925, B'nai Brith pledged to sponsor Hillel's activities with a budget of approximately $12,000 that year. By then, it encompassed 120 Hillel foundations and affiliates at an additional 400 campuses. The campus foundations seek to create a welcoming environment for Jewish students on their respective campuses. Beginning in 1988, under Director Richard M. Joel, Hillel underwent an organizational shift in mission and structure.The Remaking of Hillel: A Case Study on Leadership and Organizational Transformation An integral part of this shift was the institution of a Board of Governors, chaired by Edgar M. Bronfman until 2009 when he was succeeded by Randall Kaplan. Bronfman's involvement began in 1994 during a visit by Richard Joel to the Seagram building, when Bronfman pledged his support to Hillel. When Bronfman agreed to serve as chairman, Hillel gained legitimacy among other philanthropists. The subsequent revitalization of the organization resulted in increased donor support, updated programming, and broad international recognition. Part of the increased donor support came as a result of Bronfman's well-known campus visits, beginning in 1994, that continued until his death in 2013.Edgar Bronfman Sr. dies at 84. LA Times Hillel has been described as the largest Jewish campus organization in the world. Hillel foundations are found in Israel, South America, and the Post-Soviet States, and affiliated organizations are found in 18 countries across North America, South America, Europe and the Middle East. Although the foundation was not organized nationally until 1923, Texas A&M; Hillel was founded in 1920. At the time of its founding, Texas A&M; University was named the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas.From Christian Science to Jewish Science: Spiritual Healing and American Jews Oxford University Press page 160 Other notable Hillels include Hillel at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, the first Hillel in the world, and Columbia/Barnard Hillel. = Leadership = Adam Lehman was appointed CEO of Hillel International in January 2020.

Activities Hillel International says its mission is “enriching the lives of Jewish students so that they may enrich the Jewish people and the world” through its on-campus network. More than 800 colleges and universities are connected to a local Hillel community that serves as a faith community, Jewish educational resource, social network and a place to develop leadership and professional skills. Hillel uses what it calls a relationship-based model to engage students in need of a community. Local or campus-based Hillels host a wide variety of programming from holding Shabbat worship and dinner on Friday nights, celebrating Jewish holidays, to offering classes in Jewish studies and Hebrew. Hillel provides a place for students to join together in volunteering and fundraising and provides resources for spiritual, emotional and physical well-being. Hillel International and local Hillels play a role to fight anti-Semitism on college campuses. Hillel provides security training to local Hillels and engages in dialogue with university administrations about how to recognize and confront anti-Semitism on campus. Hillel has extensive pro-Israel programming and employs post- graduate fellows from Israel from the Jewish Agency for Israel. Hillel is a major partner of the Birthright Israel program. Hillel employs more than 1,200 people worldwide and provides extensive continuing education programs for its employees through a professional development program called Hillel U. The organization also invests in early career professionals through the Springboard Fellowship. The organization imposes restrictions on activities; Hillel takes a firm stance in not promoting certain types of views on Israel, such as the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign.Members of Jewish Student Group Test Permissible Discussion on Israel. NY Times In 1997, Jeremy Deutchman, a graduate of Hillel's JCSC fellowship and a student member of Hillel's board of directors, wrote a lengthy article in Tikkun.Tikkun: \\"Hillel Incorporated: The Franchising of Modern American Jewry\\" Deutchman believes that Hillel engages in the wholesale \\"dumbing down\\" of Judaism, and providing stylish, yet meaningless Judaism instead of substantive Judaism. Deutchman says Hillel has been too similar to a massive corporation that franchises out simplistic templates to campus franchisees that removes the religious meaning of Judaism in favor of a meaningless commodity. Citing a Hillel-sponsored activity where several dozen students worked for hours constructing a sixty- pound matzoh ball, Deutchman calls it an example of where a \\"symbol triumphs over substance\\". Deutchman also questions the value of Hillel volunteers giving out trinkets, such as kazoos, to students who listen to a spiel about Hillel. Policy position on intermarriage Former Hillel president Avraham Infeld was challenged in traditional circles for asserting that Hillel accepts intermarriage—marriage of Jews to non-Jews.Faith in Nathan: \\"Maybe we shouldn’t fight intermarriage after all\\" The organization has since created resources for Hillel professionals to work with students from multifaith homes. Hillel supports LGBTQ people and pluralism across the spectrum of Jewish movements.

Harvard Hillel had barred Avraham Burg, a former speaker of the Knesset, from speaking because Burg's talk was cosponsored by Harvard Palestinian Solidarity Committee.

In response to Open Hillel, a group of students formed Safe Hillel in 2014 to preserve the pro-Israel agenda of the original Hillel organization. According to its founder Raphael Fils, \\"Hillel should not have to change its mission in order to accommodate those who don't agree with it.

Its principal payment was to public relations firm Hill & Knowlton, who were associated with the false testimony to the US Congress given by Nayirah al- Ṣabaḥ. Congressional Human Rights Caucus In October 1990 Nayirah, a teenage girl, testified before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, that she had seen Iraqi soldiers remove hundreds of Kuwaiti babies from incubators and leave them to die on hospital floors.MacArthur, J.

Bush cited the incubator story six times in speeches and seven senators cited the story as a reason for voting to give the Bush administration authorization for the Gulf War. The atrocities of the Iraqis in Kuwait were compared to that of the Nazis. Investigations After the liberation of Kuwait campaign, an ABC News reporter interviewed hospital doctors who stayed in Kuwait throughout the Iraqi occupation and indicated that the story was almost certainly false. Subsequent investigation showed that, unknown to most members of the Caucus, the 15-year-old Kuwait girl was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States, Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah. As one reporter observed, such knowledge might have led to demands of proof of Nayirah's whereabouts when she said she witnessed the atrocities and calls for corroboration of the story. The congressmen co-chairing the committee, who apparently knew the true identity of the teen-age witness, had close relationships to Hill and Knowlton, the public relations firm hired by Citizens for a Free Kuwait, the group financed by Kuwait which lobbied for Congress for U.S. military intervention. A vice president of Hill and Knowlton helped organize the congressional hearings. The same Hill & Knowlton vice president had previously defended the human rights record of Turkey, which had been criticized for jailing people without due process and torturing and killing them.

History The Roundtable was founded in 1987 as a project of the Institute For Educational Affairs. It was founded as an alternative to the Council on Foundations, another nonprofit membership association of donors. For four years the program, known then as the Philanthropic Roundtable, held occasional meetings where representatives of foundations and charities could converse with scholars and journalists about the way professional philanthropy was conducted in the U.S. It also began publication of a bimonthly newsletter, Philanthropy; offered member organizations a talent bank for hiring young staffers from its list of recent college graduates, and conducted a \\"project development service\\" that assisted members \\"in examining their own programs ... to foster innovative programming.\\"\\"Philanthropy,\\" July–August 1988, p. 16. Membership was free \\"to interested grantmakers,\\" and 140 foundations, charities and nonprofits joined in the Roundtable's first year. In 1991, The Philanthropy Roundtable became an independent entity, with its own board of directors and staff, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Philanthropy Roundtable is a 501(c)(3) organization. It has been described as conservative and non-partisan. The Roundtable publishes a quarterly magazine, Philanthropy, that includes coverage of past and ongoing philanthropic efforts and strategies, as well as news stories and commentary relevant to readers who are active in the philanthropic sector. The Roundtable also produces a series of guidebooks on philanthropic topics. In 2016, the Roundtable published the Almanac of American Philanthropy, which is a reference book that summarizes the history, purposes, effects, and modern direction of private giving. In 2005, The Philanthropy Roundtable created the Alliance For Charitable Reform (ACR), which opposes legislation that would create accreditation requirements for grant-making foundations, establish a five-year IRS review of tax-exempt status, or restrict the ability of donors to establish family foundations.\\"About The Alliance For Charitable Reform.\\" Alliance For Charitable Reform. acreform.org. 2011. =William E.

He was a member of Smile, a band which included guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Upon Staffell's departure, Smile were joined by Freddie Mercury and John Deacon to form the band Queen. Early life and music career Staffell was born in Isleworth, London, England.England & Wales births: Tim Staffel. 2012 brightsolid online publishing limited. Retrieved 16 May 2012 He attended Hampton Grammar School and was the singer in a band called the Railroaders when in 1964 he attended a concert where he met fellow Hampton pupil Brian May. They then put together a blues-rock band called '1984' with John Garnham (guitar), Dave Dilloway (bass), John Sanger (keyboards) and Richard Thompson (drums). In 1965, Staffell began a graphics and drawing course at Ealing Art College where he became friends with Freddie Mercury, whilst May enrolled at Imperial College, London. 1984 were a support act for Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd and Staffell left it in 1968 not long after May left. Staffell and May then put together a new band called Smile with Roger Taylor who auditioned to be their drummer. Staffell and May co-wrote the song \\"Doing All Right\\", which Queen included on their eponymous debut album. Following his tenure with Smile, Staffell joined Humpy Bong and then the experimental progressive rock outfit Morgan, with whom he released the albums Nova Solis and Brown Out (later retitled The Sleeper Wakes). Model maker, designer and animator Staffell later decided to pursue a career as a model maker, designer, animator and commercials director. Among the projects upon which he worked were the BBC television adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and he was the chief model maker for the first series of the children's TV show Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. Return to music In 2001, Staffell returned to the music industry, co- forming with long-time collaborator Richard Lightman a new blues-funk band called aMIGO, drawing inspiration from folk, Latin and rock. In 2003 they released one eponymous album, with re-recorded versions of the old Smile tunes \\"Earth\\" and \\"Doin' Alright\\", featuring his former bandmate Brian May on guitars and vocals. The album was self released and available on CD-R for a limited release run (less than 300 copies) and later released via iTunes. In April 2018, Staffell was invited to record his part of the song \\"Doin' Alright\\" alongside the other Smile members, Brian May and Roger Taylor, for the upcoming soundtrack to the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, which tells the life story of Freddie Mercury. The song was credited to Smile, and titled \\"Doing All Right ... Revisited\\". The music score was released in 19 October 2018, and the movie premiere was three days later. The soundtrack debuted on the UK albums chart at number 5 on 26 October 2018. The second Tim Staffell album Two Late was released on digital platforms on 26 October 2018, and it will be followed with physical limited release in the middle of November.

He was a counselor in the United States Department of State under Condoleezza Rice from 2007 to 2009. In 2019, Cohen was named the 9th Dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University, succeeding the former dean, Vali Nasr. Before his time as dean, he directed the Strategic Studies Program at SAIS. Cohen \\"is one of the few teachers in the American academy to treat military history as a serious field\\", according to international law scholar Ruth Wedgwood. Cohen is a contributing writer at The Atlantic. Biography Cohen grew up in Boston in a secular Jewish family. When he was in his teens his father became more observant and sent him to the Maimonides School, a Modern Orthodox Jewish day school in Brookline.https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-ex-bush-staffer-whose- jewish-sensibility-made-him-a-leading-trump-critic/ Cohen received his B.A. in government at Harvard University in 1977. He went on to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1982 in political science, and during his PhD training went through the Army ROTC program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was an assistant professor of government and assistant dean at Harvard University from 1982 to 1985. Following this, he taught for four years at the Naval War College in the Department of Strategy, before briefly serving in 1990 on the policy planning staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In 1990, Cohen began teaching at SAIS. After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, he directed the U.S. Air Force's official four-volume survey, the Gulf War Air Power Survey, until 1993, for which he received the Air Force's Exemplary Civilian Service Award. This analysis of the effect of U.S. air power was widely referenced in discussions of the Revolution in Military Affairs concept. In 1993, Paul Wolfowitz, who would later become prominent as the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the run-up to the Iraq War, became Dean of SAIS. During his brief stint at the defense policy planning staff, Cohen had worked under Wolfowitz but this was the first time they were in extended contact. In 1997, Cohen co-founded the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), which was a center for prominent neoconservatives. He has been a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, a committee of civilians and retired military officers that the U.S. Secretary of Defense may call upon for advice, that was instituted during the administration of President George W. Bush. He was put on the board after acquaintance Richard Perle put forward his name.C-SPAN Q&A; transcript – “I think my name was probably put forward by Richard Perle, who at that time was chairman, but I don't know.” Cohen has referred to the War on Terrorism as \\"World War IV\\". In the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he was a member of Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, a group of prominent persons who pressed for an invasion. On 2 March 2007, Cohen was appointed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to serve as Counselor of the State Department, replacing Philip D. Zelikow. He exited government along with his peers at the end of term for the Bush presidency. He currently sits on the America Abroad Media advisory board. Political views =Statements on US foreign policy= Cohen was one of the first neoconservatives to publicly advocate war against Iran and Iraq. In a November 2001 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Cohen identified what he called World War IV and advocated the overthrow of Iran's government as a possible next step for the Bush Administration. Cohen claimed \\"regime change\\" in Iran could be accomplished with a focus on \\"pro-Western and anticlerical forces\\" in the Middle East and suggested that such an action would be \\"wise, moral and unpopular (among some of our allies)\\". He went on to argue that such a policy was as important as the then identified goal of Osama Bin Laden's capture: \\"The overthrow of the first theocratic revolutionary Muslim state and its replacement by a moderate or secular government, however, would be no less important a victory in this war than the annihilation of bin Laden.\\"World War IV: Lets call the conflict what it is. The Wall Street Journal 20 November 2001 Later in 2001, Cohen, in what was becoming a dominant theme of his writing, advocated war against Iraq once again and proceeded to outline how effortless such a military campaign would be: > After Afghanistan, what? Iraq is the big prize... One important element will > be the use of the Iraqi National Congress to help foster the collapse of the > regime, and to provide a replacement for it. The INC, which has received > bad, and in some cases malicious treatment, from the State Department and > intelligence community over the years, may not be able to do the job with > U.S. air support alone.Iraq Can't Resist Us. The Gulf War was a cakewalk. > The enemy is even weaker now.. The Wall Street Journal 23 December 2001 As a result of his public statements on why a war against Iraq was necessary, Cohen was invited to appear on CNN Wolf Blitzer Reports and amongst other statements given in response to questioning from Blitzer offered the judgment: > We know that he [Saddam Hussein] supports terror. There's very solid > evidence that the Iraqis were behind an attempt to assassinate President > Bush's father. And we—by the way, we do know that there is a connection with > the 9/11 terrorists.

CNN > Wolf Blitzer Reports, 23 January 2002 In testifying to a Congressional House committee later in 2002, Cohen was quoted as saying: > ..the choice before the United States is a stark one, either to acquiesce in > a situation which permits the regime of Saddam Hussein to restore his > economy, acquire weapons of mass destruction and pose a lethal threat to his > neighbors and to us, or to take action to overthrow him.

Indeed, the > dangers of failing to act in the near future are unacceptable.\\"The Talented > Mr. Cohen\\" National Interest Online, Ximena Ortiz, 2 March 2007. In a piece for the Wall Street Journal on 6 February 2003, Cohen fervently praised the presentation given by then Secretary of State Colin Powell in which he outlined the case for military action against Iraq to the United Nations. He went on to indicate that it was time for those who doubted that the case had been proven to support the Bush administration in their efforts.\\"The Reluctant Warrior\\" reproduced from Wall Street Journal, Eliot A. Cohen 6 February 2003. An article written for The Washington Post on 10 July 2005 raised the attention of commentators in the media and \\"blogosphere\\". The piece, an attempt to articulate Cohen's self identified roles as academic, pundit, and father, was written as his son prepared to deploy to Iraq to fight a war the elder Cohen had been calling for since early 2001. The piece ends: > There is a lot of talk these days about shaky public support for the war. > That is not really the issue. Nor should cheerleading, as opposed to truth- > telling, be our leaders' chief concern. If we fail in Iraq—and I don't think > we will—it won't be because the American people lack heart, but because > leaders and institutions have failed. Rather than fretting about support at > home, let them show themselves dedicated to waging and winning a strange > kind of war and describing it as it is, candidly and in detail. Then the > American people will give them all the support they need. The scholar in me > is not surprised when our leaders blunder, although the pundit in me is > dismayed when they do. What the father in me expects from our leaders is, > simply, the truth—an end to happy talk and denials of error, and a > seriousness equal to that of the men and women our country sends into the > fight.\\"A Hawk Questions Himself as His Son Goes to War\\" The Washington Post, > 10 July 2005. This piece was extensively discussed in the blogosphere at the time, with some progressive blogs decrying that Cohen continued to maintain that the invasion was justified. Other commentators expressed surprise that a figure with such access and impeccable neoconservative credentials could appear to criticise the Bush Administration in such a way. Cohen later stated that he had received overwhelmingly positive responses from senior military officials in a resulting interview on C-SPAN. Cohen also continued his criticism of the conduct of the war, stating that, \\"Those three guys—Tommy Franks, George Tenet, and L. Paul Bremer—got the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's just wrong.\\" As a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee Cohen had also been engaged in meetings involving US President George Bush. During these meetings Cohen provided advice on strategy in the Iraq conflict.\\"The Talented Mr. Cohen\\" National Interest Online, Ximena Ortiz 2 March 2007. =View on military experience and policy-making skills= In 2002, Cohen defended the PNAC membership against the charge that its personnel were chicken-hawks. Cohen found unsupported the opinion that, compared to civilians, veterans possess \\"sheer moral authority\\" or \\"are uniquely qualified to make judgments on matters of war and peace.\\" As an example, Cohen states: > There is no evidence that generals as a class make wiser national security > policymakers than civilians. George C. Marshall, our greatest soldier > statesman after George Washington, opposed shipping arms to Britain in 1940. > His boss, Franklin D. Roosevelt, with nary a day in uniform, thought > otherwise. Whose judgment looks better?Eliot A. Cohen, \\"Hunting 'Chicken > Hawks'\\" , The Washington Post, September 5, 2002: A31, rpt. sais.jhu.edu > (School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)), accessed June 1, 2007. > And WP archival copy. =Appointment to Department of State= On 2 March 2007, it was reported by The Washington Post that Cohen was to be appointed as Condoleezza Rice's \\"counselor\\" at the United States Department of State. Cohen replaced Philip D. Zelikow and said he would fill time before appointment in April 2007 by acting as a consultant for Rice. The tone of the Washington Post article—Cohen is described as a \\"critic\\" of the Iraq war—was soon criticised. An article by Ximena Ortiz in the National Interest Online called Cohen's ability to do the job into question and attempted to juxtapose his previous statements on the Bush administration foreign policy with the resulting war in Iraq.\\"The Talented Mr. Cohen\\" National Interest Online, Ximena Ortiz 2 March 2007. Adding to the criticism was Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com who, describing Cohen as \\"extremist a neoconservative and warmonger as it gets\\", suggested an internal significance of the appointment for the Bush administration: > The Cohen appointment, is clearly another instance where neoconservatives > place a watchdog in potential trouble spots in the government to ensure that > diplomats do not stray by trying to facilitate rapproachments between the > U.S. and the countries on the neoconservative War hit list.\\"Greenwald: State > Department promotion sends Iran war signal\\" excerpts of article reproduced > by Mike Sheehan in the Raw Story, 5 March 2007. As the controversy played out in the media, a rebuttal of sorts from Ruth Wedgwood, international law scholar at Johns Hopkins University, sought to defend Cohen from criticism.\\"The Talented Mr. Cohen: A Response\\" National Interest Online, Ruth Wedgwood 12 March 2007. Ortiz was subsequently supported in her criticism by fellow commentator at National Interest Online, Anatol Lieven, who raised the level of criticism to include Cohen's efforts as a historian and analyst as well as tackling other pronouncements on US foreign policy in the Middle East made by Cohen.\\"Eliot Cohen and Democratic Responsibility\\" National Interest Online, Anatol Lieven 16 March 2007. =Mearsheimer and Walt Paper= In March 2006, Harvard's Kennedy School of Government Academic Dean Stephen M. Walt along with Professor John J. Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago, both political scientists, published an academic paper titled The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy. The paper criticizes the Israel lobby for influencing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East away from U.S. interests and towards Israel's interests. Eliot Cohen wrote in a prominent op-ed piece in The Washington Post that the academic working paper bears all the traditional hallmarks of anti-Semitism: \\"obsessive and irrationally hostile beliefs about Jews\\", accusations toward Jews of \\"disloyalty, subversion or treachery, of having occult powers and of participating in secret combinations that manipulate institutions and governments\\", as well as selection of \\"everything unfair, ugly or wrong about Jews as individuals or a group\\" and equally systematical suppression of \\"any exculpatory information\\". Mearsheimer and Walt have denied Cohen's assertions as false, dishonest and ridiculous, noting that criticism of Israeli state policy and influential American advocates of that policy, such as Cohen, is not the same thing as demonization of Jewish people.Mearsheimer, John J. and Walt, Stephen. letter to the London Review of Books, May 11, 2006. =Chuck Hagel nomination= Along with a large number of other Republicans, Cohen opposed Barack Obama's prospective nomination of Republican Chuck Hagel as U.S. Secretary of Defense in late 2012. Cohen was quoted as saying: > If you have somebody there [at Defense] who's already made it clear that he > does not want to engage in a confrontation with Iran, what kind of > negotiating leverage do we have? ... You want to have as secretary of > defense somebody who's the heavy. Somebody who's the guy who looks as if > he's perfectly capable of waging war against you and happy to do it. That's > just kind of elementary negotiating tactics.Bowman, Tom, \\"Hagel Would Be > First Former Enlisted Soldier To Run Pentagon\\", NPR All Things Considered, > December 24, 2012. Retrieved 2012-12-24. =2014 Crimean crisis= Cohen wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post on 3 March 2014, between the ousting of Viktor Yanukovich on 22 February and the Crimean referendum on 16 March. In it, he maintains that \\"Putin is indeed a brutal Great Russian nationalist who understands that Russia without a belt of subservient client states is not merely a very weak power but also vulnerable to the kind of upheaval that toppled Yanukovych’s corrupt and oppressive regime.\\" He mentions The New York Times publication of the op-ed by Putin on the Syrian chemical arms question and links to the text of the NATO accord as a token of good faith. = Never Trump movement = Cohen wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post on 15 November 2016 after the 2016 presidential election affirming his stance against the presidency of Donald Trump. In the piece he states: > I am a national security Never-Trumper who, after the election, made the > case that young conservatives should volunteer to serve in the new > administration, warily, their undated letters of resignation ready. That > advice, I have concluded, was wrong. [...] My friend was seething with anger > directed at those of us who had opposed Donald Trump — even those who stood > ready to help steer good people to an administration that understandably > wanted nothing to do with the likes of me, someone who had been out front in > opposing Trump since the beginning. Cohen also wrote an op-ed piece in The Atlantic on 29 January 2017 commenting on his distaste for Donald Trump as a person: > Many conservative foreign-policy and national-security experts saw the > dangers last spring and summer, which is why we signed letters denouncing > not Trump's policies but his temperament; not his program but his character. > We were right. And friends who urged us to tone it down, to make our peace > with him, to stop saying as loudly as we could \\"this is abnormal,\\" to > accommodate him, to show loyalty to the Republican Party, to think that he > and his advisers could be tamed, were wrong.

She is voiced by writer Alex Borstein and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Lois was created and designed by series creator Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company based on Larry and Steve, a short he made which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". Lois is the mother of the Griffin family. She and her husband, Peter, have three children: Meg, Chris, and Stewie, along with the family dog, Brian. Lois is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and housewife, despite her admitting to being a recovering methamphetamine-addict and a kleptomaniac. Lois has also had several affairs, one of which allegedly resulted in the conception of Meg. Role in Family Guy Lois Griffin was born to affluent WASP parents, Carter and Barbara Pewterschmidt. It is revealed in the episode \\"Family Goy\\" that her mother is actually a Holocaust survivor who concealed her Judaism, though she was raised a Protestant. Lois and the rest of the Griffins live in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, which is modeled after Cranston, Rhode Island. Lois also speaks with a distinctive New England accent. She primarily works as a housewife throughout the series, though she did give piano lessons in early episodes. Lois has also had various jobs in single episodes such as in \\"FOX-y Lady\\", where she becomes the new reporter for Fox News Channel, in \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\", Lois is elected the mayor of Quahog, and in \\"Call Girl\\" Lois gets a job doing phone sex. In the episode \\"Take a Letter\\", Lois works at the Post Office, where she sarcastically states \\"she is 6,004th in line for the Presidency.\\" Character =Creation= When he was still in college, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short called The Life of Larry. The short centered around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve. He made a sequel called Larry & Steve, which Cartoon Network broadcast in 1997. In 1999, MacFarlane was working for Hanna- Barbera Studios, writing for shows such as Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and Cow and Chicken. The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters. MacFarlane received a US$50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was about one twentieth of what most pilots cost. MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely The Simpsons and All in the Family. Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, namely The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, and Rubik, the Amazing Cube. In three months, MacFarlane created the Griffin family and developed a pilot for the show he called Family Guy. Brian's character was largely based on Steve from the Larry and Steve cartoon, with Larry serving as the primary basis of the Peter character. The character's personality was also partially inspired by a friend of his father who rudely fell asleep while watching the 1993 film Philadelphia. The network executives were impressed with the pilot and ordered thirteen episodes, giving MacFarlane a 2 million dollar per-season contract. =Voice= Alex Borstein is the voice of Lois Griffin. Lois Griffin is voiced by producer and staff writer, Alex Borstein, who also voices recurring characters such as Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein has been part of the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, and has been voicing Lois from the start. At the time Family Guy was being developed, Borstein was working in the sketch comedy, MADtv. She was asked to audition by a member of the MADtv staff who was helping MacFarlane develop the show. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any artwork and said it was \\"really sight unseen\\". At the time, she was doing a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redhead mother, whose voice she had based on one of her cousins from Long Island, New York. She took the voice of the character to the set and use it for Lois. The voice was originally slower, when MacFarlane heard it, he asked her to make it faster and higher. Borstein has noted that the voice of Lois has been changing from the slower original voice to the quicker up tempo voice of the present episodes. There have been occasions where Borstein does not voice Lois, such as in the episode \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", where Lois is not voiced by Borstein in a scene and instead was voiced by Japanese actress Kei Ogawa, who was required for a scene where everything in the world was Japanese (she also did the voice of Meg for the scene). =Personality= Lois's personality has evolved throughout the episodes. She is commonly the voice of reason to Peter's shenanigans, but in some episodes she can act darker than normal and sometimes shows a taste for sadomasochism. In the episode \\"The Son Also Draws\\", Lois showed a gambling-addiction when the family went to an Indian casino and lost the family car. In the episode \\"Model Misbehavior\\", Lois becomes a bulimic model. However, in \\"Sibling Rivalry\\", just the opposite happens where Lois gains a ton of weight after Peter has a vasectomy and loses his sex drive. After outgrowing Peter in terms of size, she discovers she enjoys being fat, leading to a new sex life where she lets Peter force feed her junk food so she can continue to grow bigger and fatter. \\"Stuck Together, Torn Apart\\" shows Peter and Lois splitting up because of Peter's jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same jealousy characteristic and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature. =Sexuality= Many episodes have suggested that Lois is bisexual or least bi-curious. In an interview, Borstein stated that Lois became \\"a little more snarky and sassy and sexual\\" since the first season to challenge \\"those sitcom rules that a woman is supposed to be a total wet blanket and not like sex and is no fun\\". In the first straight-to-DVD feature, Stewie Griffin, The Untold Story, Lois also states, \\"women are such teases. That's why I went back to men.\\" She reveals in \\"Partial Terms of Endearment\\" that she had a lesbian affair with Naomi while they were students at Salve Regina University, and she passionately kisses Meg's lesbian classmate Sarah in \\"Brian Sings and Swings\\". In the pilot episode for The Cleveland Show, she and Bonnie make out to fulfill Cleveland's, Peter's, Quagmire's, and Brian's wish. Reception =Commendations= Lois ranked number 12 spot on \\"IGN's Top 25 Family Guy Characters\\". In \\"IGN's top 10 musical moments in Family Guy\\" ranked number three spot with the song, \\"This House Is Freakin' Sweet\\" from the episode, \\"Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater\\", (season 2, 1999). In \\"IGN's Family Guy: Top 10 Fights\\", Lois ranked on two places, in number seven and number 6 for Lois's fight with Stewie in \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" and in the Griffin Family Fight from \\"Barely Legal\\", respectively. Cultural influence =Appearances in other media= Lois has had several television appearances outside of Family Guy. She and Peter both had a cameo on Drawn Together in the episode \\"The Lemon- AIDS Walk\\" where she was voiced by Borstein. In the Family Guy parodies of the Star Wars original trilogy titled \\"Blue Harvest\\", \\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\\" and \\"It's A Trap\\" which are parodies of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi respectively, Lois appears as Princess Leia. Lois, and most of the central characters on Family Guy, also appeared in the pilot episode of the show's spin-off The Cleveland Show. She came in at No. 85 out of 100 on Maxim's 2012 Hot 100. She also appears in Season 2, Episode 2 of HBO's Animals. =Merchandise= Lois is also featured on the Family Guy: Live in Vegas CD, and plays a significant part in Family Guy Video Game!, the first Family Guy video game, which was released by 2K Games in 2006. Borstein recorded exclusive material of Lois for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball. In 2004, the first series of Family Guy toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz, each member of the Griffin family had their own, except for Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released, with various forms of Peter. As of 2009, six books have been released about the Family Guy universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. These include Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One (), which covers the entire events of the episode \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\", and Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded (), a collection of seventeen essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers which include Lois as a character.

After receiving his PhD in Government from Harvard, Friedberg joined the Princeton University faculty in 1987 and was appointed professor of politics and international affairs in 1999. He has served as Director of Princeton's Research Program in International Security at the Woodrow Wilson School as well as Acting Director of the Center of International Studies at Princeton. Friedberg is a former fellow at the Smithsonian Institution’s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Norwegian Nobel Institute, and Harvard University’s Center for International Affairs. He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Counselors for the National Bureau of Asian Research's Pyle Center for Northeast Asian Studies.NBR's Pyle Center for Northeast Asian Studies In September 2001, Friedberg began a nine-month residential appointment as the first Henry Alfred Kissinger Scholar at the Library of Congress. During his tenure he researched \\"the rise of Asia and its implications for America.\\" Apart from many articles for Commentary magazine, Friedberg has written several books on foreign relations. He was one of the signers of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) documents Statement of Principles (June 3, 1997) and a letter on terrorism submitted to President George W. Bush (September 20, 2001). His name has been connected to the Aspen Strategy Group at the Aspen Institute. Friedberg represented the Romney campaign in his capacity as the campaign's National Security Advisor during a debate on US policy toward China in October 2012.  International relations philosophy  Although Friedberg's international relations philosophy is rooted in concern for the structural organization of power characteristic of the realist school of international relations, he draws from many of the traditions of liberal institutionalism, resulting in what scholar Thomas Christensen has termed a \\"positive-sum\\" stance on international relations. Hence, unlike more pessimistic realist scholars, Friedberg, in a seminal article published in International Security in 1993, advocated continued U.S. engagement in East Asia to serve as a stabilizing force until regional economic integration and multilateral institutions had time to develop. Thus, in contrast to traditional realpolitik scholars, Friedberg believes that conflict is not inevitable in East Asia as China continues to develop as long as multilateral institutions and economic integration are used as tools to manage security dilemmas.

Events requiring little space, such as boxing and wrestling, were practised there. The palaestra functioned both independently and as a part of public gymnasia; a palaestra could exist without a gymnasium, but no gymnasium could exist without a palaestra.  Etymology  Compare Ancient Greek palaiein - \\"to wrestle\\" and palē - \\"wrestling\\" Palaestrophylax or palaistrophylax (), meaning “palaestra guard”, was the guardian or the director of a Palaestra. Architecture The architecture of the palaestra, although allowing for some variation, followed a distinct, standard plan. The palaestra essentially consisted of a rectangular court surrounded by colonnades with adjoining rooms. These rooms might house a variety of functions: bathing, ball playing, undressing and storage of clothes, seating for socializing, observation, or instruction, and storage of oil, dust or athletic equipment. Vitruvius, through his text De architectura, is an important ancient source about this building type and provides many details about what he calls \\"palaestra, Greek- style\\". Although the specifics of his descriptions do not always correspond to the architectural evidence, probably because he was writing around 27 BC, his account provides insight into the general design and uses of this type of space. As Vitruvius describes, the palaestra was square or rectangular in shape with colonnades along all four sides creating porticoes. The portico on the northern side of the palaestra was of double depth to protect against the weather. Big halls (exedrae, εξέδρες) were built along the single depth sides of the palaestra with seats for those enjoying intellectual pursuits, and the double depth side was divided into an area for youth activities (ephebeum, εφηβαίο), a punching bag area (coryceum, κωρυκείον), a room for applying powders (conisterium, κονιστἠριον), a room for cold bathing (λουτρόν), and an oil storeroom (elaeothesium, ελαιοθέσιον). Good examples of this building type come from two major Greek sites: Olympia and Delphi. During the Roman Imperial period the palaestra was often combined with, or joined to, a bath. When the Arabs and the Turkish adopted the tradition of the Roman baths, they did not continue the tradition of the attached palaestra.

His throne name, Userkheperure Setepenre, means \\"Powerful are the manifestations of Re, the chosen one of Re.\\"Clayton, p.158 He was the son of Merneptah and Isetnofret II and sat on the throne during a period known for dynastic intrigue and short reigns, and his rule was no different. Seti II had to deal with many serious plots, most significantly the accession of a rival king named Amenmesse, possibly a half brother, who seized control over Thebes and Nubia in Upper Egypt during his second to fourth regnal years. Contest for the throne Evidence that Amenmesse was a direct contemporary with Seti II's rule--rather than Seti II's immediate predecessor --includes the fact that Seti II's royal KV15 tomb at Thebes was deliberately vandalised with many of Seti's royal names being carefully erased here during his reign.Aidan Dodson, The Decorative Phases of the Tomb of Sethos II and their Historical Implications, JEA 85 (1999), pp.136-38 The erasures were subsequently repaired by Seti II's agents. This suggests that Seti II's reign at Thebes was interrupted by the rise of a rival: king Amenmesse in Upper Egypt.Dodson, p.131 Secondly, the German scholar Wolfgang Helck has shown that Amenmesse is only attested in Upper Egypt by several Year 3 and a single Year 4 ostracas; Helck also noted that no Year 1 or Year 2 ostracas from Deir El Medina could legitimately be assigned to Amenmesse's reign.Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, p.213 This conforms well with the clear evidence of Seti II's control over Thebes in his first two years, which is attested by various documents and papyri. In contrast, Seti II is absent from Upper Egypt during his third and fourth years which are notably unattested—presumably because Amenmesse controlled this region during this time.E.F. Wente & C.C. Van Siclen, A Chronology of the New Kingdom, Studies in Honor of George R. Hughes, January 12, 1977, SAOC 39, Chicago: Oriental Institute, p.252 Mummy of Seti II. Finally, and most importantly, it is well known that the chief foreman of Deir el-Medina, a certain Neferhotep, was killed in the reign of king Amenmesse on the orders of a certain 'Msy' who was either Amenmesse himself or one of this king's agents, according to Papyrus Salt 124.Jac Janssen, \\"Amenmesse and After: The chronology of the late Nineteenth Dynasty Ostraca\\" in 'Village Varia. Ten Studies on the History and Administration of Deir el-Medina,' (Egyptologische Utigaven 11), Leiden; 1997, pp.99-109 However, Neferhotep is attested in office in the work register list of Ostraca MMA 14.6.217, which also recorded Seti II's accession to the throne and was later reused to register workers' absences under this king's reign.Janssen, p.104 If Seti II's 6-year reign followed that of the usurper Amenmesse, then this chief foreman would not have been mentioned in a document which dated to the start of Seti II's reign since Neferhotep was already dead.Janssen, p.100 This indicates that the reigns of Amenmesse and Seti II must have partly overlapped with one another and suggests that both rulers were rivals who were fighting each another for the throne of Egypt. During the second to fourth years of Amenmesse/Seti II's parallel reigns, Amenmesse gained the upper hand and seized control over Upper Egypt and Nubia; he ordered Seti II's tomb in the Valley of the Kings to be vandalised. Prior to his fifth year, however, Amenmesse was finally defeated by his rival, Seti II, who was the legitimate successor to the throne since he was Merneptah's son. Seti II, in turn, launched a damnatio memoriae campaign against all inscriptions and monuments belonging to both Amenmesse and this king's chief supporters in Thebes and Nubia, which included a certain Khaemter, a former Viceroy of Kush, who had served as Amenmesse's Vizier. Seti II's agents completely erased both scenes and texts from KV10, the royal tomb of Amenmesse.Otto Schaden, \\"Amenmesse Project Report, \\"ARCE Newsletter,\\" No.163 (Fall. 1993) pp.1-9 Vizier Khaemter's scenes in Nubia which were carved when he served as the Viceroy of Kush were so thoroughly erased that until Rolf Krauss' and Labib Habachi's articles were published in the 1970s,Rolf Krauss, Untersuchungen zu König Amenmesse, \\" SAK 5 (1977) pp.131-74 & Labib Habachi, \\"King Amenmesse and Viziers Amenmose and Kha'emtore: Their Monuments and Place in History,\\" MDAIK 34 (1978) pp.58-67 his career here as viceroy was almost unknown, notes Frank J.

An obelisk erected by Seti II in front of Karnak temple Seti II promoted Chancellor Bay to become his most important state official and built 3 tombs - KV13, KV14, and KV15 - for himself, his Senior Queen Twosret and Bay in the Valley of the Kings. This was an unprecedented act on his part for Bay, who was of Syrian descent and was not connected by marriage or blood ties to the royal family. Because Seti II had his accession between II Peret 29 and III Peret 6 while Siptah—Seti II's successor—had his accession around late IV Akhet to early I Peret 2,Jürgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen Ägypten, MAS:Philipp von Zabern, (1997), p.201 Seti's 6th and final regnal year lasted about 10 months; therefore, Seti II ruled Egypt for 5 years and 10 months or almost 6 full years when he died. Due to the relative brevity of his reign, Seti's tomb was unfinished at the time of his death. Twosret later rose to power herself after the death of Siptah, Seti II's successor. According to an inscribed ostraca document from the Deir el-Medina worker's community, Seti II's death was announced to the workmen by \\"The [Chief of] police Nakht-min\\" on Year 6, I Peret 19 of Seti II's reign.KRI IV: 327. II.22-28, §57 (A.17) Since it would have taken time for the news of Seti II's death to reach Thebes from the capital city of Pi-Ramesses in Lower Egypt, the date of I Peret 19 only marks the day the news of the king's death reached Deir el-Medina.Jacobus J. Janssen, Village Varia: Ten Studies on the History and Administration of Deir el-Medina, Egyptologische Uitgaven 11 (Leiden: Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, 1997), 153-54 Seti II likely died sometime late in IV Akhet or early in I Peret; Wolfgang Helck and R.J.

JARCE 39 (1997), pp.49-56 which is written above an inscription of Messuy, a Viceroy of Nubia under Merneptah, on a rock outcropping at Bigeh Island. However, Messuy's burial in Tomb S90 in Nubia has been discovered to contain only funerary objects naming Merneptah which suggests that 1) Messuy may have died during Merneptah's reign and 2) Seti II may have merely associated himself with an official who had actively served his father as Viceroy of Kush. Seti II soon changed his royal name to 'Userkheperure Meryamun', which was the most common form of his prenomen. Two important papyri date from the reign of Seti II. The first of these is the \\"Tale of Two Brothers\\", a fabulous story of troubles within a family on the death of their father, which may have been intended in part as political satire on the situation of the two half brothers. The second is the records of the trial of Paneb. Neferhotep, one of the two chief workmen of the Deir el-Medina necropolis, had been replaced by Paneb, his troublesome son-in-law. Many crimes were alleged by Neferhotep's brother—Amennakhte—against Paneb in a violently worded indictment preserved in papyrus now in the British Museum. If Amennakhte's testimony can be trusted, Paneb had allegedly stolen stone from the tomb of Seti II while still working on its completion—for the embellishment of his own tomb—besides purloining or damaging other property belonging to that monarch. Paneb was also accused of trying to kill Neferhotep, his adopted father-in-law, despite being educated by the latter and after the murder of Neferhotep by 'the enemy,' Paneb had reportedly bribed the Vizier Pra'emhab in order to usurp his father's office. Whatever the truth of these accusations, it is clear that Thebes was going through very troubled times. There are references elsewhere to a 'war' that had occurred during these years, but it is obscure to what this word alludes—perhaps to no more than internal disturbances and discontent. Neferhotep had complained of Paneb's attacks on himself to the vizier Amenmose, presumably a predecessor of Pra'emhab, whereupon Amenmose had punished Paneb. This trouble-maker had then brought a complaint before 'Mose' (i.e., 'Msy'), who then acted to remove Pra'emhab from his office. Evidently this 'Mose' must have been a person of the highest importance, perhaps the king Amenmesse himself or a senior ally of the king. Seti II also expanded the copper mining at Timna Valley in Edom, building an important temple to Hathor, the cow goddess, in the region. It was abandoned in the late Bronze Age collapse, where a part of the temple seems to have been used by Midianite nomads, linked to the worship of a bronze serpent discovered in the area.Magnusson, Magnus, \\"Archaeology of the Bible Lands\\" (BBC Books) Seti II also founded a station for a barge on the courtyard in front of the pylon II at Karnak, and chapels of the Theban Triad – Amun, Mut and Khonsu. Wives and treasure Of the wives of Seti II, Twosret and Takhat seem certain. Twosret would rule as regent for Siptah and later as Pharaoh. Her name is recorded in Manetho's Epitome as a certain 'Thuoris' who is assigned a reign of 7 years. Takhat bears the title of King's Daughter which would make her the offspring of either Ramesses II or Merenptah. A list of princesses dated to Year 53 of Ramesses II names a Takhat who is not included in earlier lists. This would make her about the same age or younger than Seti II. The traditional view has been that the rivals were half-brothers, with Takhat as Queen to Merenptah and mother to Amenmesses while the mother of Seti II was Isetnofret II. Takhat is shown on several statues of Amenmesse and on one of these, she is called King's Daughter and King's Wife with the word 'wife' inscribed over 'Mother'. According to Aidan Dodson the title was recarved when Seti regained control and usurped the statue. This would seem to indicate that Takhat was married to Seti and that Amenmesse was Seti's son and usurped the throne from his own father.Dodson, A.; Poisoned Legacy: The Decline and Fall of the Nineteenth Egyptian Dynasty, American University Press in Cairo, 2010. Appendix 4, p 40 Dodson allows that there may have been two women named Takhat, but the treatment of the image of Takhat makes it unlikely. Gold earrings containing Seti II's name discovered in KV56 For many years, a certain Tiaa was also accepted as a wife of Seti II and mother of Siptah. This was based on a number of funerary objects found in the tomb of Siptah bearing the name of Tiaa as King's Wife and King's Mother. However, it now seems that these items washed into Siptah's tomb from the nearby tomb, KV32, as the result of an accidental breakthrough. KV32 is the tomb of the wife of Thutmose IV, Tiaa.Dodson, A, (2010), p 91 In January 1908, the Egyptologist Edward R. Ayrton, in an excavation conducted for Theodore M. Davis, discovered a small burial in tomb KV56 which Davis referred to as 'The Gold Tomb' in his publication of the discovery in the Valley of the Kings; it proved to contain a small cache of jewelry that featured the name of Seti II.Davis, T. M., The Tomb of Sipthah, the Monkey Tomb and the Gold Tomb, No.4, Bibân el Molûk, Theodore M. Davis' Excavations, A. Constable, London, 1908 A set of \\"earrings, finger-rings, bracelets, a series of necklace ornaments and amulets, a pair of silver 'gloves' and a tiny silver sandal\\" were found within this tomb.

Iklé's expertise was in defense and foreign policy, nuclear strategy, and the role of technology in the emerging international order. After a career in academia (including a professorship at MIT) he was appointed director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1973–1977, before becoming Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (1981 to 1988). He was later a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Department of Defense's Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, a Distinguished Scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and a Director of the National Endowment for Democracy. Iklé is credited with a key role in increasing U.S. aid to anti-Soviet rebels in the Soviet–Afghan War. He successfully proposed and promoted the idea of supplying the rebels with anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, overcoming CIA opposition. Early life and education Iklé was born Fritz Karl Iklé in Samedan, Switzerland in 1924, and up in St. Gallen. He anglicized his name after moving to the United States in 1946.Washington Post, 16 November 2011, Fred Charles Ikle, Reagan defense official, dies at 87 He earned a degree at the University of Zurich with a master's and doctorate from the University of Chicago (1948 and 1950), both in sociology. His doctorate involved research in Dresden and Nagasaki and led to a book, The Social Impact of Bomb Destruction, (1958). From 1964 to 1967 Iklé was a professor in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was also at the Rand Corporation and at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. At Harvard, he met Henry Kissinger, and in 1973 Kissinger (then Richard Nixon's national security advisor) recruited Iklé to government service. Career From 1973 to 1977 Iklé served as director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. After the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, Iklé was appointed Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, serving from 1981 to 1988. =Under Secretary of Defense= As an under secretary of defense, Iklé led the effort to lobby for National Security Decision Directive 166 (\\"Expanded US Aid to Afghan Guerrillas\\"), signed by Reagan in March 1985.Heymann, Philip B., (2008) Living the Policy Process (2008), pp. 38–39. When he visited Pakistan in April 1985, Iklé found that the CIA was still pursuing the war in a halfhearted manner.Heymann, pp. 46–47. \\"We began to understand that what to us was a very big deal back in Washington, from the point of view of the president, is a second order priority handled by one GS [civil service officer],\\" according to Michael Pillsbury, Iklé's deputy. Iklé sponsored a proposal to supply the rebels with Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles.Heymann pp. 42–43, 77. The Stinger proposal was at first strongly opposed by the CIA, the U.S. State Department, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. CIA Deputy Director John McMahon, who resisted the proposal, was the target of a letter-writing campaign by conservative groups. At a meeting on December 6, 1985, Iklé asked McMahon if the CIA needed Stingers. \\"I decided then and there that I had enough of carrying water for the Joint Chiefs and I said 'Fred, I'll take every Stinger you can send me,'\\" McMahon recalled.Heyman, p. 75. Despite McMahon's apparent change of heart, the CIA again vetoed the Stinger proposal at an interagency meeting in mid-February 1986.Heyman, p. 80. President Reagan signed an executive order to supply the Angolan guerrilla group UNITA with Stingers on February 18, and the CIA finally agreed to supply them to the Afghan rebels on February 23. He is mentioned in chapter 14 of the novel Fail-Safe as someone working with the Air Force to reduce the chance of war by accident. Later life Iklé remained at the Defense Department until 1988, when he joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Iklé served as a Commissioner on the National Commission on Terrorism, which produced the Report of the National Commission on Terrorism in June 2000, and he served for nine years as Director of the National Endowment for Democracy. He also co-chaired the bipartisan Commission on Integrated Long- Term Strategy, which published Discriminate Deterrence in January 1988. In 1975 and 1987, Iklé received the highest civilian award of the Department of Defense, the Medal for Distinguished Public Service. In 1988, he was awarded the Bronze Palm. Iklé served as chairman of the Board of the Telos Corporation and as a director of the Zurich-American Insurance Companies. He was a Director of CMC Energy Services and served as Governor of the Smith Richardson Foundation and as a Director of the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. He was a founding signatory of the Project for the New American Century's 1997 \\"statement of principles.\\"Elliott Abrams, et al., \\"Statement of Principles\\" , June 3, 1997, Project for the New American Century, accessed May 28, 2007.

Podhoretz's family was leftist, with his elder sister joining a socialist youth movement. He skipped two grades and attended the prestigious Boys High School in the borough's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, ultimately graduating third in his class in 1946; his classmates included the prominent Assyriologist William W. Hallo and advertising executive Carl Spielvogel. Following his admission to Harvard University and New York University with partial tuition scholarships, Podhoretz ultimately elected to attend Columbia University when he was granted a full Pulitzer Scholarship.Jeffers, Thomas L. (2010). Norman Podhoretz: A Biography. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. . p. 5-6. In 1950, Podhoretz received his BA degree in English literature from Columbia, where he was mentored by Lionel Trilling. He concurrently earned a second bachelor's degree in Hebrew literature from the nearby Jewish Theological Seminary of America; although Podhoretz never intended to enter the rabbinate, his father (who only attended synagogue on the High Holidays) wanted to ensure that his son was nonetheless conversant in \\"the intellectual tradition of his people\\", as \\"a nonobservant New World Jew who ... treasured the Hebraic tradition\\".Jeffers (2010), p. 13. After being awarded the Kellett Fellowship from Columbia and a Fulbright Scholarship, he later received a second BA in literature with first-class honors and an Oxbridge MA from Clare College, Cambridge, where he briefly pursued doctoral studies after rejecting a graduate fellowship from Harvard. He also served in the United States Army from 1953 to 1955 as a draftee assigned to the Army Security Agency.\\"Podhoretz, Norman\\" (profile). Section, \\"Résumé\\". Right Web. rightweb.irc-online.org. Retrieved March 31, 2018. Career Podhoretz served as Commentary magazine's Editor-in-Chief from 1960 (when he replaced Elliot E. Cohen) until his retirement in 1995. Podhoretz remains Commentary's Editor-at- Large. In 1963, he wrote the essay \\"My Negro Problem – And Ours\\", in which he described the oppression he felt from African-Americans as a child, and concluded by calling for a color-blind society, and advocated \\"the wholesale merging of the two races [as] the most desirable alternative for everyone concerned.\\"http://www.lukeford.net/Images/photos/out.pdf From 1981 to 1987, Podhoretz was an adviser to the U.S. Information Agency. From 1995 to 2003, he was a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush in 2004. The award recognized Podhoretz's intellectual contributions as editor-in-chief of Commentary magazine and as a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.White House Personnel Announcement, Office of the Press Secretary, June 18, 2004. Norman Podhoretz was one of the original signatories of the \\"Statement of Principles\\" of the Project for the New American Century founded in 1997. That organization sent a letter to President Clinton in 1998 advocating the removal by force of Saddam Husein in Iraq. Podhoretz received the Guardian of Zion Award from Bar-Ilan University on May 24, 2007. He served as a senior foreign policy advisor to Rudy Giuliani in his 2008 presidential campaign.Giuliani's War Cabinet The American Prospect, September 25, 2007 The same year, he publicly advocated an American attack on Iran.\\"His Toughness Problem – and Ours\\", by Ian Buruma Podhoretz's 2009 book Why Are Jews Liberals? questions why American Jews for decades have been dependable Democrats, often supporting the party by margins of better than two-to-one, even in years of Republican landslides.Norman Podhoretz, Jewish conservative, asks, 'Why are Jews liberals?' Personal life  Podhoretz is married to author Midge Decter, and together they have had two children: the syndicated columnist and current Commentary editor-in-chief John Podhoretz and the American-Israeli journalist Ruthie Blum. Norman Podhoretz said in early 2019, of his large family and its relation to his political views: \\"[I]f [Trump] doesn’t win in 2020, I would despair of the future. I have 13 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren, and they are hostages to fortune. So I don’t have the luxury of not caring what’s going to happen after I’m gone.\\"An Interview with Norman Podhoretz April 16, 2019, Claremont Political views Initially a staunch liberal, Podhoretz moved Commentary to the left editorially when he took over the magazine. However, he became increasingly critical of the New Left and gradually moved rightward as the 1960s wore on. By the 1970s, he was a leading member of the neoconservative movement. =American history= Podhoretz has downplayed the importance of American history to his political beliefs. When Gore Vidal was writing his play On the March to the Sea, based on General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea during the U.S. Civil War, Podhoretz asked him: > \\"Why are you writing a play about, of all things, the Civil War?\\" When Vidal > explained that this was/is \\"the great, single tragic event that gives > resonance to our Republic\\", Podhoretz replied, \\"To me, the Civil War is as > remote and irrelevant as the War of the Roses\\".Pettifer, Ann (December 14, > 2002) Zionism Unbound, CounterPunch =Iraq= In the leadup to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Podhoretz argued strongly for military intervention, claiming that Saddam Hussein posed a direct threat to the United States.Podhoretz N., \\"In Praise of the Bush Doctrine,\\" Commentary Magazine, Sept. 2002 After the 9/11 attack and more than a year before the start of the War in Iraq, Podhoretz wrote in February 2002 that \\"There is no doubt that Saddam already possesses large stores of chemical and biological weapons, and may ... be 'on the precipice of nuclear power.' ... Some urge that we ... concentrate on easier targets first. Others contend that the longer we wait, the more dangerous Saddam will grow. Yet whether or not Iraq becomes the second front in the war against terrorism, one thing is certain: there can be no victory in this war if it ends with Saddam Hussein still in power.\\"Podhoretz N., \\"How to Win World War IV,\\", Commentary Magazine, February 2002 =Iran= In 2007, Podhoretz argued that the United States should attack Iranian nuclear facilities. According to The Sunday Times, Podhoretz believes that \\"Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran are merely different fronts of the same long war.\\"Baxter, Sarah. \\"Neocon godfather Normal Podhoretz tells Bush: bomb Iran.\\" The Sunday Times. September 30, 2007 Podhoretz describes diplomatic efforts with Iran as similar to appeasement of Nazi Germany prior to World War II. He also contends that the War on Terror is a war against Islamofascism, and constitutes World War IV (World War III having been the Cold War), and advocates the bombing of Iran to preempt Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons.Podhoretz N., \\"The Case for Bombing Iran,\\" The Wall Street Journal, May 30, 2007. Accessed May 30, 2007. His book on that subject, entitled World War IV: The Long Struggle Against Islamofascism, was published by Doubleday on September 11, 2007. (published online September 6, 2007) In a 2007 column, Podhoretz explicitly stated his view that Iran should be attacked: \\"In short, the plain and brutal truth is that if Iran is to be prevented from developing a nuclear arsenal, there is no alternative to the actual use of military force—any more than there was an alternative to force if Hitler was to be stopped in 1938.\\" =Vietnam= In an editorial to The Wall Street Journal on the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Podhoretz contends that the retreat from Iraq should not be similar to the retreat from Vietnam. He argues that when the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam, it sacrificed its national honor.Podhoretz N., \\"America the Ugly\\" The Wall Street Journal, September 11, 2007. Accessed September 11, 2007. In 1982, James Fallows wrote a review of Podhoretz's book, Why We Were in Vietnam, for The New York Times, in which he accuses Podhoretz of \\"changing his views\\" and \\"self-righteousness\\" on the subject of Vietnam, noting that in 1971 Podhoretz wrote that he would \\"prefer just such an American defeat to a 'Vietnamization' of the war.\\"Fallows, James \\"In Defense of an Offensive War\\" The New York Times, March 28, 1982. Accessed January 3, 2008. A larger quote from Why We Were in Vietnam which was included in the review is as follows: =Soviet Union= In the early 1980s, Podhoretz was extremely skeptical that fundamental reform was possible in the USSR, and sharply criticized those who argued that U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union should be one of détente. In his 1980 book The Present Danger, Podhoretz predicted that the United States was in danger of losing the Cold War and falling behind the Soviet Union as a global power.Norman Podhoretz, The Present Danger, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1980. Later he would express anger with President Ronald Reagan for \\"not establishing sufficiently strong policies toward the Soviets.\\"\\"The Rise of Neoconservatism\\", The Virginia Quarterly Review, Spring, 1996 =George W. Bush= Podhoretz has praised Bush, calling him \\"a man who knows evil when he sees it and who has demonstrated an unfailingly courageous willingness to endure vilification and contumely in setting his face against it.\\" He calls Bush the president who was \\"battered more mercilessly and with less justification than any other in living memory.\\" =Sarah Palin= In a 2010 Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled \\"In Defense of Sarah Palin,\\" Podhoretz wrote, \\"I hereby declare that I would rather be ruled by the Tea Party than by the Democratic Party, and I would rather have Sarah Palin sitting in the Oval Office than Barack Obama.\\"Podhoretz, Norman (March 30, 2010) \\"In Defense of Sarah Palin.\\" The Wall Street Journal. =Donald Trump= Podhoretz says of the 2016 Republican nomination process: Podhoretz says his views however, have caused him to lose ex-friends who were anti-Trump, saying: \\"Well some of them have gone so far as to make me wonder whether they’ve lost their minds altogether.\\" Of Trump, he argues: \\"[T]he fact that Trump was elected is a kind of miracle. I now believe he’s an unworthy vessel chosen by God to save us from the evil on the Left... His virtues are the virtues of the street kids of Brooklyn. You don’t back away from a fight and you fight to win. That’s one of the things that the Americans who love him, love him for—that he’s willing to fight, not willing but eager to fight. And that’s the main virtue and all the rest stem from, as Klingenstein says, his love of America. I mean, Trump loves America.\\" =Immigration = Podhoretz says that he had formerly been unthinkingly pro-immigration \\"because I’m the child of immigrants. And I thought it was unseemly of me to oppose what not only had saved my life, but had given me the best life I think I could possibly have had.\\" However, his views later changed: \\"In 1924, immigration virtually stopped and the rationale for the new policy was to give newcomers a chance to assimilate—which may or may not have been the main reason—but it probably worked. What has changed my mind about immigration now—even legal immigration—is that our culture has weakened to the point where it’s no longer attractive enough for people to want to assimilate to, and we don’t insist that they do assimilate. ... That was the culture of the prewar period. You certainly wanted your children to be Americans—real Americans.\\"An Interview with Norman Podhoretz April 16, 2019, Claremont Books * 1963: Hannah Arendt on Eichmann: A Study in the Perversity of Brilliance.

An anthropomorphic white Labrador voiced by Seth MacFarlane, he is one of the show's main characters as a member of the Griffin family. He primarily works in the series as a less-than-adept writer struggling to find himself, attempting essays, novels, screenplays, and newspaper articles. He first appeared on television, along with the rest of the family, in a 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Brian was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve, two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". Brian has been featured in many items of merchandise for Family Guy, and he is considered to be one of the show's biggest merchandising characters. He has also made crossover appearances in the other MacFarlane-produced shows, such as American Dad! and The Cleveland Show. As a character, Brian has initially been very well received by critics although reception in recent years have been mixed. When Brian was killed off in the season 12 episode \\"Life of Brian\\", the events of the episode received substantial attention from the media and elicited strongly negative reactions from fans of the show. Brian subsequently returned two episodes later, in \\"Christmas Guy\\", after Stewie, his best friend, travels back in time to save him. Role in Family Guy A Toyota Prius, similar to the one Brian drives Brian is a white-furred anthropomorphic dog. He can talk, generally walks on his hind legs (using his front legs as arms), has opposable thumbs, drives a second-generation Toyota Prius (with the license plate \\"BRI- DOG\\"), and is often portrayed as the only sane person in his family. He is the pet dog of the Griffin family, and in keeping with the show's treatment of anthropomorphic characters generally, Brian's human attributes receive little acknowledgment and no explanation; he is largely treated as a human character. Brian is the best friend of Stewie, and many of the show's sub-plots center around them. They are occasionally at the center of the plot, for instance in the \\"Road to...\\" episodes. Brian and Stewie have a love–hate relationship in which they constantly argue and humiliate each other, and yet show appreciation for each other several times. In the episode \\"Brian and Stewie\\", they admit that they love each other as friends, and give each other's lives purpose. Brian is very fond of dry martinis and is seen to have withdrawal symptoms in various episodes when he is told or forced to stop drinking. These episodes suggest that Brian is possibly an alcoholic. He smokes occasionally, although in the episode \\"Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington\\", after seeing Peter promoting a corrupt cigarette company, he quit smoking, a habit he resumed at the end of that episode. He also regularly smokes marijuana. After a brief stint as a drug sniffing dog, he developed a cocaine addiction, but after spending time in rehab he managed to achieve sobriety. He is the son of Coco and Biscuit, who were normal dogs, though Brian's human attributes have been present since he was a puppy. He claims his father is racist, and Brian seems to have inherited these feelings. Brian received an Ivy League education, having attended Brown University, as seen in \\"Brian Goes Back to College\\" but was one course away from graduating. He is also an Iraq War veteran because Stewie signed them both up for the Army, in \\"Saving Private Brian\\". Family Guy uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not age much, so the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. However, several of the characters, such as Meg Griffin, have aged two to three years since the show's pilot episode, while others, such as Stewie and Brian, have aged very little. At the start of the series, Brian was 7, but is currently 8 years old. Despite his intelligence, Brian has shown conventional dog behavior on occasion. He barks at the mailman yet \\"gets very sad on Sundays\\" when the mailman does not visit their house, he greatly fears the vacuum cleaner which Lois refers to as \\"Mr. Hoover\\" and in the episode \\"Bill & Peter's Bogus Journey\\" it is revealed that Brian can only defecate and urinate on the Griffin's front lawn. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. An example of this is when in \\"Brian: Portrait of a Dog\\", Peter is shown in a flashback finding a fully grown Brian as a stray. However, in \\"The Man with Two Brians\\", Brian tries to regain attention from the Griffin family by showing them home videos of him as a puppy, although none of the videos of him as a puppy showed any member of the Griffin family, so it is possible that the videos were filmed by a previous owner. He also has a human son named Dylan, who was a regular marijuana smoker, before Brian managed to turn Dylan's life around, from a violent, uneducated teenager, to an eloquent and kind-hearted young man. Stewie is very confused upon how Brian as an 8-year-old dog can have a teenage son, and Brian's remark about it being in dog years confuses him even further. Brian is a political liberal, who supports legalizing marijuana, gay marriage and ending the \\"war on terror\\". He is also an atheist, although in the episode \\"April in Quahog\\" he starts praying out of panic when news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons announce on the news that the world will end (later revealed to be an April Fools joke). Despite appearing to be well-read, Brian's intelligence is generally average, if not below average. He often tries to impress others of how smart he is but is frequently corrected by others, mainly Stewie. After taking the SATS for Meg, it is revealed that Brian actually scored the lowest in the class which causes him to have an identity crisis. (The low SAT score was later explained by Brian having a brain tumor at the time.) He has since been generally insecure about his intelligence and will sometimes take credit for some of Stewie's achievements in order to make himself look smart. Brian sees himself as a romantic and has had several relationships over the years, mainly with human women. Brian will often abandon his own personal beliefs and personality in order to make himself more appealing to the women he's attracted to and sometimes resorts to lying in order to make himself look good. These relationships often end badly due to his inflated ego or being caught in a deception. His longest lasting relationship was with Jillian Russell, a beautiful but dim witted girl who Brian dated in season 5. He eventually moves in with her but is unable to pay rent. This eventually leads to a fight when Brian reveals he didn’t want to move in with her. He later tries to win her back but discovers she's now dating Adam West, leaving him heartbroken. =Writing career= Brian is an aspiring but struggling writer – this is said to be a reference to Snoopy from Peanuts. Brian is unemployed, but he is often seen writing various novels, screenplays or essays. His difficult writing career and apparent lack of talent is used as a recurring joke throughout the series. In the episode \\"Play it Again, Brian\\", Brian won an award for an essay he wrote, though he later admits that he plagiarized the piece. Brian has written since college, as told in \\"Brian Griffin's House of Payne\\", in which his TV drama “What I Learned on Jefferson Street” pilot is accepted (and then drastically amended) by CBS. In the episode \\"Movin' Out\\", Brian starts writing his book Faster Than The Speed of Love, which is revealed to be a rip-off of the Iron Eagle films, specifically Aces: Iron Eagle III. In the episode \\"420\\", Brian finally publishes his novel Faster Than the Speed of Love, and the novel is shipped, but it is critically panned and does not sell a single copy. In the episode \\"Dog Gone\\", he receives an invitation (from the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence) to an award ceremony celebrating his novel. Brian, convinced that he is a great writer, attempts to gain the family's interest in this piece of news but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the \\"award ceremony\\", however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word \\"special\\". Later in the episode \\"Brian Griffin's House of Payne\\", he writes a television script entitled \\"What I Learned on Jefferson Street\\", and it was shown to a TV network who picked it up after reading it. Although the script was good, the finished product was not, as James Woods intervened and turned Brian's script into a farcical comedy piece revolving around Woods going back to college, where he is roommates with a monkey named Mr. Teenie. In the episode \\"Brian Writes a Bestseller\\", Brian writes a bestselling self- help book, Wish It, Want It, Do It, which he wrote in a few hours and consists mostly of blank pages. The book is an immediate success, but Brian lets the fame go to his head. He eventually causes the downfall of his book's popularity, and things go back to normal. It is mentioned again to get a girl in \\"Yug Ylimaf\\". Brian's latest literary attempt came in the episode \\"Brian's Play\\", where Brian writes a play entitled A Passing Fancy. The play becomes very popular in Quahog; however, Brian is upset when he realizes that Stewie had since written a play which was better than his. Stewie's play was eventually shown on Broadway. Brian became depressed, as he only wanted to be a good writer for the few years which remain of his life, and not have to be overshadowed by Stewie, who has his whole life ahead of him. Character =Creation= Series creator Seth MacFarlane created and voices Brian. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short entitled Life of Larry. The short centered around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve. In 1997, when MacFarlane was working for Hanna- Barbera Studios, writing for shows such as Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and Cow and Chicken, he made a sequel to Life of Larry. The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters. MacFarlane received a US$50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was, as MacFarlane stated in a 2006 interview, \\" about one twentieth of what most pilots cost\\". MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely The Simpsons and All in the Family. Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, namely The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, and Rubik, the Amazing Cube. In three months, MacFarlane created the Griffin family and developed a pilot for the show he called Family Guy. Brian's character was largely based on Steve, and Larry would be the main inspiration for the Peter character. =Voice= The voice of Brian is provided by series creator Seth MacFarlane, who also provides the voices of many other characters including Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. Brian's voice is MacFarlane's normal speaking voice. William H. Macy auditioned unsuccessfully for the role. In the episode \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", Brian was voiced by Japanese actor Kotaro Watanabe in a scene in an alternate universe where everything is Japanese (due to an American defeat in the Second World War). Reception Ahsan Haque of IGN has given Brian a positive review, calling him the best talking man-dog. He also praised Brian's adventures with Stewie calling them, \\"center of many of the show's best bits\\". Haque later made a list titled \\"Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures\\", where he stated that \\"Brian and Stewie paired together has always been a winning formula for Family Guy\\". They also praised the selection of Brian to play Chewbacca as they stated in the \\"Blue Harvest\\" review. In their list of \\"What Else Should Family Guy Make Fun Of?\\", IGN commented that Brian would be perfect to play Q, if Family Guy ever decides to make a James Bond parody. However, in a review of the seventh season, Haque wrote that Brian \\"unfortunately was terribly misused this season. He's degenerated into nothing more than a soapbox for the political views of the writers\\". In a review of the eighth season, following his transition into a heel character, Ramsey Isler stated that Brian \\"left his lofty position as the voice of reason and switched to pretentious loser\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club praised the Brian character, and stated that \\"Brian has always been the show's best character and its most developed one\\". In a 2004 interview, Seth MacFarlane noted his similarities to Brian. He also revealed that Brian is his favorite character, because he feels most comfortable when playing that role. =Commendations= In IGN's \\"Family Guy: Top 10 Fights\\", Brian's fight with Stewie in the episode \\"Patriot Games (season 4, 2006) is ranked number 5. In IGN's \\"Top 10 musical moments in Family Guy\\", Brian ranked number 6, number 5, and number 3 with the songs, \\"The Freakin' FCC\\" from \\"PTV\\" (season 4, 2005), \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" from \\"Meet the Quagmires\\" (season 5, 2007) and \\"This House Is Freakin' Sweet\\" from \\"Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater\\" (season 2, 1999) respectively. In a list of the Top 25 Family Guy characters compiled by IGN, Brian was placed second on the list (behind Stewie). They stated that \\"man's best friend is a poor understatement\\" with regards to Brian. =Death and resurrection= Brian's death was the main focus in the season twelve episode \\"Life of Brian\\". After Stewie destroys his time machine because of the risks of changing history and losing their lives, Brian and Stewie arrive home with a street hockey net they had found in a dump, where Stewie destroyed his time machine for good. As he is setting it up, Brian is struck by a reckless driver in a hit and run and later succumbs to his injuries at the veterinary clinic. Stewie is unable to rebuild the time machine as he cannot acquire a new power supply. After a month of mourning the loss of their beloved pet, the family replaces Brian with a new dog, named Vinny. The death of Brian in the episode \\"Life of Brian\\" was met with massive opposition and anger from Family Guy fans around the world, many of whom threatened to boycott the show due to Brian's absence. Family Guy's official Facebook and Twitter pages were bombarded with messages and comments from fans demanding that they bring Brian back. Hostile messages were also directed towards Family Guy's producing staff, including the show's creator, Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane later thanked fans \\"for caring so much about the canine Griffin, he is overcome with gratitude.\\" Fan petitions sprang up within hours of \\"Life of Brian\\"'s first airing, also receiving media attention including most prominently a Change.org petition directed towards Seth MacFarlane, making the petition one of the fastest- growing entertainment-related petitions on the site, attracting over 120,000 signatures. Two episodes later in \\"Christmas Guy\\", Stewie still misses Brian dearly and spots a past incarnation of himself who has traveled forward in time to Christmas (an event referenced in \\"Life of Brian\\"). Stealing the time machine's return pad from his past self while Vinny provides a distraction, Stewie goes back in time and saves Brian's life, at the cost of erasing himself from history. Brian is extremely grateful for being saved, but Stewie of this timeline finds Brian's affections unnerving, not knowing the reason behind them. The episode ends with the family sitting around their Christmas tree with everything back to normal. After \\"Christmas Guy\\" aired, Seth MacFarlane tweeted, \\"you didn't really think we'd kill off Brian, did you? Jesus, we'd have to be fucking high.\\" In other media Brian is featured in a Family Guy parody in the South Park episode \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\". The scene depicted a conversation between Peter and Brian leading to one of the show's trademark cut-away gags; like Peter, Brian was rendered in the distinct animation style of South Park. Brian also appeared in one episode of Seth MacFarlene's other animated sitcom, American Dad! titled The People vs. Martin Sugar. When Stan Smith begins to mention his list of \\"Top 10 Fictitious Dogs,\\" with the last one being Brian, he briefly appears confused asking Stan, \\"Uh, do I know you?\\", which is an homage to MacFarlane himself since he voices both characters. Brian was also featured, along with Stewie, in advertisements for Wheat Thins and Cool Whip. He and Stewie also introduced the 2007 Emmy Awards with a song which recapped the events in television, over the past year. The song was adapted from the one sung by Brian, Stewie and Peter in the Family Guy episode \\"PTV\\". =Merchandise= Brian is featured on the Family Guy: Live in Vegas CD, and also plays a significant part in Family Guy Video Game!, the first Family Guy video game, which was released by Sierra Entertainment in 2006. He (along with Stewie) features at the center of Family Guy's second video game, Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse. MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Brian's voice and other Family Guy characters for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball. In 2004, the first series of Family Guy toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz, each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures have been released. As of 2009, six books have been released about the Family Guy universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. This include Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One (), which covers the entire events of the episode \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\", and Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded (), a collection of seventeen essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers. which include Brian as a character. A book written from Brian's point of view (actually written by Andrew Goldberg) was published in 2006. It was called Brian Griffin's Guide to Booze, Broads and the Lost Art of Being a Man.

It is one of the oldest Jewish advocacy organizations and, according to The New York Times, is \\"widely regarded as the dean of American Jewish organizations\\". As of 2009, AJC envisions itself as the \\"Global Center for Jewish and Israel Advocacy\\". Besides working in favor of civil liberties for Jews, the organization has a history of fighting against all forms of discrimination in the United States and working on behalf of social equality, such as filing a friend-of-the-court brief in the May 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education and participating in other events in the Civil Rights Movement. About AJC is an international advocacy organization whose key areas of focus is to promote religious and civil rights for Jews internationally. The organization has 22 regional offices in the United States, 10 overseas offices, and 33 international partnerships with Jewish communal institutions around the world.\\"Where We Work \\" (2016). American Jewish Committee. ajc.org. Retrieved 2016-12-24. AJC's programs and departments include the Africa Institute, the Asia Pacific Institute, the Belfer Center for American Pluralism, the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, Contemporary Jewish Life, Government and International Affairs, the Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Institute for International Interreligious Affairs, Interreligious and Intergroup Relations, the Dorothy and Julius Koppelman Institute for American Jewish-Israeli Relations, the Latino and Latin American Institute, Project Interchange, the Lawrence and Lee Ramer institute for German-Jewish Relations, Russian Affairs, Thanks to Scandinavia, the Transatlantic Institute, and the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council. History = 1900-1929 = On November 11, 1906, 81 Jewish Americans met in the Hotel Savoy in New York City to establish the American Jewish Committee. The group was concerned about pogroms against Jews in the Russian Empire. The official committee statement on the purpose was to \\"prevent infringement of the civil and religious rights of Jews and to alleviate the consequences of persecution.\\" In its early years the organization was led by lawyer Louis Marshall, banker Jacob H. Schiff, Judge Mayer Sulzberger, scholar Cyrus Adler, and other well-to-do and politically connected Jews. Later leaders were Judge Joseph M. Proskauer, Jacob Blaustein, and Irving M. Engel. In addition to the central office in New York City, local offices were established around the country. Starting in 1912, Louis B. Marshall was president of the organization until 1929. In 1914, AJC helped create the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, established to aid Jewish victims of World War I. After the war, Marshall went to Europe and used his influence to have provisions guaranteeing the rights of minorities inserted into the peace treaties. While president, Marshall is credited with making the AJC a leading voice in the 1920s against immigration restriction. Additionally, he succeeded in stopping Henry Ford from publishing anti-Semitic literature and distributing it through his car dealerships and forced Ford to apologize publicly. = The 1930s and 1940s = AJC advocated finding places of refuge for Jewish refugees from Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, but had little success. After World War II broke out in 1939, AJC stressed that the war was for democracy and discouraged emphasis on Hitler's anti-Jewish policies lest a backlash identify it as a \\"Jewish war\\" and increase anti-Semitism in the U.S. When the war ended in 1945, it urged a human rights program upon the United Nations and proved vital in enlisting the support that made possible the human rights provisions in the UN Charter. = The 1950s = AJC took the position that prejudice was indivisible, and that the rights of Jews in the United States could be best protected by arguing in favor of the equality of all Americans. AJC supported social science research into the causes of and cures for prejudice, and forged alliances with other ethnic, racial and religious groups. The organization's research was cited in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education that outlawed segregated schools.Brief for the American Jewish Committee et al. as amicus curiae, Barbara Grutter v. Lee Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003). Supreme Court of the United States. Retrieved 16 November 2013. In 1950 AJC President Jacob Blaustein reached an agreement with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion stating that the political allegiance of American Jews was solely to their country of residence. By the Six-Day War of 1967 AJC had become a passionate defender of the Jewish state, shedding old inhibitions to espouse the centrality of Jewish peoplehood. = The 1960s and 1970s = Through direct dialogue with the Catholic Church, AJC played a leading role in paving the way for a significant upturn in Jewish-Christian relations in the years leading up to the Roman Catholic Church's 1965 document Nostra aetate, and in the ensuing years. Before the Six-Day War in 1967, AJC was officially \\"non-Zionist\\". It had long been ambivalent about Zionism as possibly opening up Jews to the charge of dual loyalty, but it supported the creation of Israel in 1947-48, after the United States backed the partition of Palestine. It was the first American Jewish organization to open a permanent office in Israel. In the 1970s AJC spearheaded the fight to pass anti-boycott legislation to counter the Arab League boycott of Israel. In particular, Japan's defection from the boycott was attributed to AJC persuasion. In 1975 AJC became the first Jewish organization to campaign against the UN's \\"Zionism is Racism\\" resolution, a campaign that finally succeeded in 1991. AJC played a leading role in breaking Israel's diplomatic isolation at the UN by helping it gain acceptance in WEOG (West Europe and Others), one of the UN's five regional groups. AJC was active in the campaign to gain emigration rights for Jews living in the Soviet Union; in 1964 it was one of the founders of the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry, which in 1971 was superseded by the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. AJC created Present Tense, a magazine of Jewish Affairs edited by Murray Polner, in 1973. = The 1980s and 1990s = Founded in 1982, Project Interchange runs seminars in Israel for influential Americans. In December 1987 AJC's Washington representative, David Harris, organized the Freedom Sunday Rally on behalf of Soviet Jewry. Approximately 250,000 people attended the D.C. rally, which demanded that the Soviet government allow Jewish emigration from the USSR. In 1990, David Harris become Executive Director. Under his leadership, AJC became increasingly involved in international affairs. Regular meetings with foreign diplomats both in the United States and in their home countries were supplemented each September by what came to be called a “diplomatic marathon,” a series of meetings with high-level representatives of foreign countries who were in New York for the UN General Assembly session. The AJC annual meeting was also moved from New York to Washington, D.C., so that more government officials and foreign diplomats might participate. In 1998 AJC established a full-time presence in Germany—the first American Jewish organization to do so—opening an office in Berlin. In 1999 AJC ran an ad campaign in support of the NATO's intervention in Kosovo.American Jewish Committee. \\"AJC Runs Ads Applauding Nato Action In Kosovo; Urges Public To Also Express Appreciation\\". 15 April 1999. Available online: http://www.charitywire.com/charity11/00477.html = The 2000s = In 2000, AJC helped establish the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival in Atlanta, Georgia, the largest Jewish film festival in the world. In 2001 AJC became official partners with the Geneva-based UN Watch. AJC opened in Brussels the AJC Transatlantic Institute in Brussels in 2004, which according to its mission statement works to promote \\"transatlantic cooperation for global security, Middle East Peace and human rights.\\" That same year, it opened a Russian Affairs Division to identify and train new leaders in American Jewish public advocacy. Other offices were opened in Paris, Rome, Mumbai, and São Paulo. In 2005, as part of its continuing efforts to respond to humanitarian crises, the organization contributed US$2.5 million to relief funds and reconstruction projects for the victims of the South Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in the US.Humanitarian Campaigns In May 2006, nearly 2,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the 100th Annual Meeting of the American Jewish Committee. President George W. Bush, U.N. Security-General Kofi Annan, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attended a reception to honor the committee. These individuals gave credit to the American Jewish Committee for protecting Jewish Security and human rights around the world. In 2007, Commentary, a magazine published by AJC that focused on political and cultural commentary and analysis of politics and society in the U.S. and the Middle East, separated from AJC and became its own organization. In 2008, AJC stopped publishing the American Jewish Yearbook, a highly detailed annual account of the Jewish life in the U.S., Israel and the world. AJC became increasingly involved in the advocacy of energy independence for the U.S. on the grounds that this would reduce dependence on foreign, especially Arab, oil; boost the American economy; and improve the environment. AJC urged Congress and several Presidential administrations to take action toward this goal, and called upon the private sector to be more energy-conscious. It adopted \\"Green\\" policies for itself institutionally, and in 2011 earned LEED certification, denoting that its New York headquarters was energy efficient and environmentally sound. As part of a new strategic plan adopted in 2009, AJC said it envisioned itself as the \\"Global Center for Jewish and Israel Advocacy\\" and the \\"Central 'Jewish Address' for Intergroup Relations and Human Rights.\\" Its new tagline was \\"Global Jewish Advocacy.\\" In 2010, AJC renamed their annual conference \\"Global Forum\\". = The 2010s = AJC diplomatic efforts since 2010 include opposition to Iran's program to attain nuclear capability; a campaign to get the European Union to designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization; preserving the right of Jews to practice circumcision in Germany; and urging the government of Greece to take action against the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party. Along with other agencies such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Union for Reform Judaism, the AJC condemned a move in mid-2014 by the U.S. Presbyterian Church to divest from companies that do business with Israel settlements. An AJC statement asserted that the divestment is just one incident of the U.S. church group \\"demonizing Israel\\", referring to \\"one-sided reports and study guides, such as 'Zionism Unsettled'\\" as proof of anti-Zionist sentiments.Gruen, Sarah. \\"Jewish groups condemn US Presbyterian Church vote to divest from Israel\\" The Jerusalem Post. June 22, 2014. In 2016, the AJC and Islamic Society of North America formed the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council to address rising bigotry against Jews and Muslims in the United States. On 22 February 2019, AJC condemned the Otzma Yehudit party, calling its views \\"reprehensible.\\" The AJC statement said Otzma Yehudit's views \\"do not reflect the core values that are the very foundation of the State of Israel.\\" The AJC statement came after the Bayit Yehudi party merged with Otzma Yehudit and the new joint slate appeared likely to win enough votes to earn seats in the next Knesset as well as ministerial roles for some of its members. = The 2020s = In January 2020, AJC and the Muslim World League, a Mecca-based non-governmental organization, led a historic joint delegation of Muslims and Jews to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi German death and concentration camp. The trip was the most senior Islamic delegation to ever visit Auschwitz. The AJC delegation included 24 people. As a part of the visit, David Harris and Dr. Al-Issa, Secretary-General of the Muslim World League, published a joint opinion editorial in the Chicago Tribune on how Auschwitz united Muslims and Jews.  Criticism  =AJC response during Holocaust= AJC \\"worked to contain nativist sentiment in America rather than work to open America’s doors to refugees\\" during the Holocaust. They were criticized for their lack of reaction and silence during the Holocaust; historian and AJC National Director of Jewish Communal Affairs Steven Bayme said AJC leaders never understood the uniqueness of Nazism and its \\"war against the Jews.\\" Controversy =New anti-semitism= A 2007 essay, \\"Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism\\" by Professor Alvin H. Rosenfeld, published on the AJC website, criticized Jewish critics of Israel by name, particularly the editors and contributors to \\"Wrestling With Zion: Progressive Jewish-American Responses to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\\" (Grove Press), a 2003 collection of essays edited by Tony Kushner and Alisa Solomon. The essay accused these writers of participating in an \\"onslaught against Zionism and the Jewish State,\\" which he considered a veiled form of supporting a rise in antisemitism. In an editorial, the Jewish newspaper The Forward called Rosenfeld's essay \\"a shocking tissue of slander\\" whose intent was to \\"turn Jews against liberalism and silence critics.\\" Richard Cohen remarked that the essay \\"has given license to the most intolerant and narrow- minded of Israel's defenders so that, as the AJC concedes in my case, any veering from orthodoxy is met with censure ... the most powerful of all post- Holocaust condemnations—anti-Semite—is diluted beyond recognition.\\" The essay was also criticized by Rabbi Michael Lerner and in op-eds in The Guardian and The Boston Globe. In a Jerusalem Post op-ed, AJC Executive Director David Harris explained why the organization published Rosenfeld's essay in 2007: :Rosenfeld has courageously taken on the threat that arises when a Jewish imprimatur is given to the campaign to challenge Israel's very legitimacy. He has the right to express his views no less than those whom he challenges. It is important to stress that he has not suggested that those about whom he writes are anti-Semitic, though that straw-man argument is being invoked by some as a diversionary tactic. As befits a highly regarded and prolific scholar, he has written a well-documented and thought-provoking essay that deserves to be considered on its merits. =Unity pledge= In October 2011 AJC issued a joint statement with the Anti-Defamation League urging American Jews to support a Joint Unity Pledge stating: \\"America's friendship with Israel is an emotional, moral and strategic bond that has always transcended politics.\\" It urged that \\"now is the time to reaffirm that Israel's well-being is best served, as it always has been, by American voices raised together in unshakeable support for our friend and ally.\\" The statement aroused a storm of protest from Jewish opponents of President Obama's re-election, who perceived it as a call to avoid criticizing the president's policies toward Israel. In the pages of The Wall Street Journal, former Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith asked: \\"Since when have American supporters of Israel believed that a candidate's attitudes toward Israel should be kept out of electoral politics? Since never.\\" David Harris responded that the statement was intended to preserve the tradition of bipartisan support for Israel and prevent it from becoming \\"a dangerous political football.\\" While Harris recognized the right of anyone in the Jewish community to take a partisan position, he stressed the need for \\"strong advocacy in both parties\\" at a time of looming international difficulties for the Jewish state.

If they were a father-son succession, Tyti, who bears the titles of King's Daughter, King's Wife and King's Mother, would seem [to be] a good candidate for the wife of Ramesses X, but little else can be discerned.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 2004, , p.191 Bologna However, Dodson's hypothesis here on Tyti's position must now be discarded since it has been proven in 2010 that Tyti was rather a queen of a previous 20th dynasty pharaoh instead. She is mentioned in the partly fragmented Harris papyrus to be Ramesses III's wife as Dodson himself acknowledges.Mark Collier, Aidan Dodson, & Gottfried Hamernik, P.

He is the editor of Commentary magazine, a columnist for the New York Post, the author of several books on politics, and a former speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Life and career Podhoretz was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of conservative journalists Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter; he is his mother's youngest child of four, and his father's youngest child of two. He grew up on the Upper West Side in New York City. He attended Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School and he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1982. In 1986, he became a five-time champion on the game show Jeopardy!. Podhoretz served as speechwriter to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as well as former President George H.W. Bush. He also served in the capacity of special assistant to White House Drug Czar William Bennett. He was co-founder as well of the White House Writers Group, a corporate speechwriting and public- relations firm in Washington, D.C. Podhoretz was a consultant for the popular television series The West Wing, including the controversial episode \\"Gaza\\" in season five, first broadcast on May 12, 2004. Podhoretz has contributed to a number of conservative publications, including National Review and the Weekly Standard, where he is a movie critic and was the magazine's deputy editor. He was also a consulting editor at ReganBooks, a former imprint of HarperCollins. Podhoretz has a regular column at the New York Post. He has also appeared on television as a political commentator, on Fox News, CNN's Reliable Sources, MSNBC, and The McLaughlin Group (in the chair usually occupied by conservative Tony Blankley), among other places. He has also worked at Time, the Washington Times, Insight on the News, and U.S. News & World Report. Podhoretz was a contributor to The Corner, a group blog run by National Review. At The Weekly Standard, one staff member said, Podhoretz's \\"arrogance and egotism had a psychological effect people can't quite believe.\\" At The Washington Times a colleague reported, he was \\"permanently frozen in juvenalia.\\" Glenn Garvin, the Central American bureau chief of the Miami Herald, once said that at the Times, Podhoretz \\"constantly complained that his brilliance wasn't appreciated.\\" On January 1, 2009, Podhoretz became editor of Commentary, succeeding Neal Kozodoy, who had been editor since 1995, when Norman Podhoretz retired. Kozodoy is currently Editor-at-Large. =Political commentary= George W. Bush Podhoretz was a steadfast supporter of U.S. president George W. Bush, and his 2004 book Bush Country called Bush \\"the first great leader of the 21st century\\". When some conservatives denounced Bush's immigration plan, Podhoretz wrote that Bush's \\"efforts on behalf of conservative causes—from faith-based policies to stem-cell research to a strict-constructionist judiciary to entitlement reform and massive tax cuts—have all fallen down the memory hole\\". Israel Podhoretz is emphatic in his defense of Israel in its conflicts with its Arab neighbors. When pundit Pat Buchanan called Israel's actions in the 2006 Lebanon War \\"un- Christian\\", Podhoretz wrote: \\"You want to know what anti-Semitism is? When Pat Buchanan calls Israel's military action 'un-Christian.' That's anti-Semitism.\\" Iraq War Podhoretz has supported the Iraq War from its inception until the present. In his book, Bush Country, he wrote, \\"The natural terrorist hunger to acquire WMDs, and Saddam Hussein's desire to humiliate the United States, combined to make Iraq a new kind of threat to America and the world.\\" In a July 25, 2006 column for the New York Post that discussed the Israel- Lebanon conflict, Podhoretz advocated a more Machiavellian policy in Iraq, writing: \\"What if the tactical mistake we made in Iraq was that we didn't kill enough Sunnis in the early going to intimidate them and make them so afraid of us they would go along with anything? Wasn't the survival of Sunni men between the ages of 15 and 35 the reason there was an insurgency and the basic cause of the sectarian violence now?\\" In a December 2006 column, he wrote, \\"The most common cliché about the war in Iraq is now this: We didn't have a plan, and now everything is in chaos... This is entirely wrong. We did have a plan—the problem is that the plan didn't work... We thought a political process inside Iraq would make a military push toward victory against a tripartite foe—Saddamist remnants, foreign terrorists and anti-American Shiites—unnecessary... The only plan that will work is a plan to face the tripartite enemy—the Saddamists, the foreign terrorists and the Shiite sectarians—and bring them to heel. Kill as many bad guys as we can, with as many troops as we can muster.\\" Immigration In disagreement with several writers at National Review and conservatives in general, Podhoretz has aggressively favored a more open immigration policy for the United States. He wrote: \\"I said merely what I feel deeply—which is that, as a Jew, I have great difficulty supporting a blanket policy of immigration restriction because of what happened to the Jewish people after 1924 and the unwillingness of the United States to take Jews in.\\" Podhoretz was generally supportive of President Bush's proposals for a guest worker program and a path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants in the U.S. In November 2007, comments on Commentary's blog \\"Contentions\\", Podhoretz attacked his former colleague at National Review Online, Mark Krikorian, for what Podhoretz called a \\"vision of a walled-off America primarily under threat from border-crossing immigrants.\\" Podhoretz attempted to connect Krikorian's stance on immigration to an isolationist foreign policy. In response, Krikorian called Podhoretz a \\"pedantic bore\\" who had no \\"actual arguments\\" against Krikorian's position on immigration. Jill Carroll incident On March 30, 2006, Podhoretz was criticized by various bloggers for posting the following comment on National Review Online approximately three hours after hostage Jill Carroll's release from her captors: \\"It's wonderful that she's free, but after watching someone who was a hostage for three months say on television she was well-treated because she wasn't beaten or killed—while being dressed in the garb of a modest Muslim woman rather than the non-Muslim woman she actually is—I expect there will be some Stockholm syndrome talk in the coming days.\\" Within days of Carroll's release, a video of Carroll slamming the \\"occupation\\" of Iraq and praising the insurgents as \\"good people fighting an honorable fight\\" appeared on an Islamist website. However, Carroll subsequently released a statement through The Christian Science Monitor's website stating that she participated in the video only because she feared for her life and because her captors said they would let her go if she participated to their satisfaction. Carroll called her captors \\"criminals, at best\\" and said she remained \\"deeply angry\\" with them. On April 1, 2006, Podhoretz wrote the following on National Review Online: \\"For writing these predictive words, which were entirely accurate, I've been pilloried all over the blogosphere. Weird, especially in light of Jill Carroll's statement today, which was an effort to address and quiet precisely the kind of talk I predicted would take place.\\" Conflicts with John Derbyshire In response to assertions by National Review writer John Derbyshire that the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre should have been more forceful in defending themselves, Podhoretz wrote: \\"The notion that a human being or group of human beings holding no weapon whatever should somehow 'fight back' against someone calmly executing other people right in front of their eyes is ludicrous beyond belief, irrational beyond bounds, and tasteless beyond the limits of reason. 'Why didn't anyone rush the guy?' Derb asks. Gee, I don't know. Because he was executing people? Because if you rush a guy with a gun, he shoots you in the head the way he executed the teachers in each classroom?\\" Podhoretz went on to ridicule Derbyshire's claim that he was touching a \\"third rail\\" by raising a subject nobody else wanted to discuss. Podhoretz has frequently clashed with Derbyshire on immigration policy and other issues. Other commentary Podhoretz often writes about popular culture, and was called the \\"resident pop culture expert\\" at National Review Online by Jonah Goldberg. Dennis Miller has called Podhoretz his \\"favorite movie reviewer.\\" Podhoretz has written that \\"it doesn't make sense to judge pop culture by its politics.\\" In 1999 a column he wrote for The New York Post, \\"A Conversation in Hell\\", which featured a conversation between Satan and Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., was killed because of its controversial nature. =Personal life and family= Podhoretz's first marriage, to Elisabeth Marie Hickey, in 1997, ended in divorce after less than three months. Since 2002, he has been married to Ayala Rae Cohen, a former co-producer for Saturday Night Live, who works for International Creative Management (ICM Partners). They have two daughters and a son. Podhoretz is related by marriage to the diplomat, lawyer and political scientist Elliott Abrams.

Kagan is an American resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), and a former professor of military history at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Biography Kagan graduated from Hamden High School before he earned a B.A. in Soviet and East European studies and a Ph.D. in Russian and Soviet military history, both from Yale University. He worked as an Assistant professor of military history at West Point from 1995 to 2001 and as an associate professor of military history from 2001 to 2005. The courses that he taught at West Point included the history of military art, grand strategy, revolutionary warfare, and diplomatic history. Kagan's brother is the foreign policy analyst Robert Kagan, whose wife is Victoria Nuland, CEO of the Center for a New American Security. Frederick Kagan is married to Kimberly Kagan, the president of the Institute for the Study of War. He and his father, Donald Kagan, who is a professor at Yale and a fellow at the Hudson Institute, both authored While America Sleeps: Self-Delusion, Military Weakness, and the Threat to Peace Today (2000). The book argued in favor of a large increase in military spending and warned of future threats, including from a potential revival of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. Frederick along with his brother Robert Kagan, who is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and their father, Donald, were all signatories to the Project for the New American Century manifesto, Rebuilding America's Defenses (2000).  Influence  Kagan authored the \\"real Iraq Study Group\\" report as the AEI's rival to the ISG report of James Baker and Lee H. Hamilton in December 2006. The AEI report, titled Choosing Victory: A Plan for Success in Iraq, was released on January 5, 2007, and Kagan was said to have won over the ear of President George W. Bush, strongly influencing his subsequent \\"surge\\" plan for changing the course of the Iraq War. Along with retired General Jack Keane, retired Colonel Joel Armstrong, and retired Major Daniel Dwyer, Kagan is credited as one of the \\"intellectual architects\\" of the surge plan. According to Foreign Policy magazine, Kagan's essay \\"We're Not the Soviets in Afghanistan\\" influenced the strategic thinking of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, which reportedly influenced Gates' decision to support sending 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. Remarking on the surge in 2015, Kagan said while the AEI group convened that \\"it never occurred to me or anybody that was involved in this that we were going to affect policy. It was simply 'Maybe we can put some concrete numbers on the table, some concrete enemy on a map, some concrete units on a grid, and force other people who want to have this discussion to wrestle with the specifics of the problem.'\\" =Petraeus= In 2010, U.S. Army General David H.

An article in the Washington Post on 19 December 2012 discussed the relationship that the Kagans had with General Petraeus and, to a much lesser extent, with his successor in July 2011, General John R. Allen. It discussed various visits made by the Kagans from mid-2010 including their having been given access to the Combined Joint Intelligence Operations Center in Petraeus' headquarters. It commented on and raised questions about their sponsorship by Defense contractors through the American Enterprise Institute.

He writes a monthly column on world affairs for The Washington Post and is a contributing editor at The New Republic. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, Kagan left the Republican Party due to the party's nomination of what he described as a \\"fascist\\" Donald Trump and endorsed Hillary Clinton for President. Personal life and education Robert Kagan was born in Athens, Greece. His father, historian Donald Kagan, a Sterling Professor of Classics and History Emeritus at Yale University and a specialist in the history of the Peloponnesian War, is of Lithuanian Jewish descent. His brother, Frederick, is a military historian and author. Kagan has a BA in history (1980) from Yale, where in 1979 he had been Editor in Chief of the Yale Political Monthly, a periodical he is credited with reviving. He later earned an MPP from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a PhD in American history from American University in Washington, D.C. Kagan is married to the American diplomat Victoria Nuland, \\"Washington Talk, New York Times, March 3, 1988. who served as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs in the Barack Obama administration. Nuland held the rank of Career Ambassador, the highest diplomatic rank in the United States Foreign Service. She is noted for her criticism of Russian policies. Ideas and career In 1983, Kagan was foreign policy advisor to New York Republican Representative Jack Kemp. From 1984–86, under the administration of Ronald Reagan, he was a speechwriter for Secretary of State George P. Shultz and a member of the United States Department of State Policy Planning Staff. From 1986–1988 he served in the State Department Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. In 1997, Kagan co-founded the now-defunct neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century with William Kristol. Through the work of the PNAC, from 1998, Kagan was an early and strong advocate of military action to \\"remove Mr. Hussein and his regime from power\\". In January 2002, Kagan and Kristol claimed in a Weekly Standard article that Saddam Hussein was supporting the \\"existence of a terrorist training camp in Iraq, complete with a Boeing 707 for practicing hijackings, and filled with non-Iraqi radical Muslims\\". Kagan and Kristol further alleged that the September 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence official several months before the attacks. The allegations were later shown to be wrong. From 1998 until August, 2010, Kagan was a Senior Associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Retrieved 2015-03-29. Andrew Bacevich referred to Kagan as \\"the chief neoconservative foreign-policy theorist\\" in reviewing Kagan's book The Return of History and the End of Dreams. A profile in The Guardian described Kagan as being \\"uncomfortable\\" with the 'neocon' title, and stated that \\"he insists he is 'liberal' and 'progressive' in a distinctly American tradition\\". In 2008, Kagan wrote an article titled \\"Neocon Nation: Neoconservatism, c. 1776\\" for World Affairs, describing the main components of American neoconservatism as a belief in the rectitude of applying US moralism to the world stage, support for the US to act alone, the promotion of American-style liberty and democracy in other countries, the belief in American hegemony,, pages 217–18 the confidence in US military power, and a distrust of international institutions. According to Kagan, his foreign-policy views are \\"deeply rooted in American history and widely shared by Americans\\". In 2006, Kagan wrote that Russia and China are the greatest \\"challenge liberalism faces today\\": \\"Nor do Russia and China welcome the liberal West's efforts to promote liberal politics around the globe, least of all in regions of strategic importance to them. ... Unfortunately, al-Qaeda may not be the only challenge liberalism faces today, or even the greatest.\\"\\"US: Hawks Looking for New and Bigger Enemies?\\". IPS. May 5, 2006. In a February 2017 essay for Foreign Policy, Kagan argued that U.S. post-Cold War retrenchment in global affairs has emboldened Russia and China, \\"the two great revisionist powers,\\" and will eventually lead to instability and conflict. In October 2018 Kagan said: \\"Unless are you willing to punish\\" Saudi Arabia for the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, \\"then they own you.\\" Writings Kagan is a columnist for The Washington Post and a contributing editor at The New Republic and The Weekly Standard. He has also written for The New York Times, Foreign Affairs, The Wall Street Journal, Commentary, World Affairs, and Policy Review. Regarding Kagan's opinion piece \\"Problem with Powell\\" (Washington Post July 23, 2000), scholar Guy Roberts states that \\"the PNAC co-founder Robert Kagan sought to explain core differences\\" between the positions of the neoconservatives and those of Colin Powell. In that piece, Kagan wrote, Clarence Lusane has described Kagan as blaming Powell \\"for Saddam Hussein remaining in power\\" in the Washington Post piece., pages 89–90] In a subsequent opinion piece \\"Spotlight on Colin Powell\\" (The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 12, 2002) Kagan praised Powell for \\"[a]rticulately defending the new Bush Doctrine\\" and declaring \\"his support for 'regime change' in Iraq\\". In 2003, Kagan's book Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order, published on the eve of the US invasion of Iraq, created something of a sensation through its assertions that Europeans tended to favor peaceful resolutions of international disputes while the United States takes a more \\"Hobbesian\\" view in which some kinds of disagreement can only be settled by force, or, as he put it: \\"Americans are from Mars and Europe is from Venus.\\" New York Times book reviewer, Ivo H. Daalder wrote: Kagan's book Dangerous Nation: America's Place in the World from its Earliest Days to the Dawn of the Twentieth Century (2006) argued forcefully against what he considers the widespread misconception that the United States had been isolationist since its inception. It was awarded a Lepgold Prize from Georgetown University. Kagan's essay \\"Not Fade Away: The Myth of American Decline\\" (The New Republic, February 2, 2012) was very positively received by President Obama.

Knopf in 1976. The book blends autobiography with old Chinese folktales. The Woman Warrior won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was named one of TIME magazine's top nonfiction books of the 1970s. Kingston in September 2006 Genre The specific genre of The Woman Warrior has been disputed due to Kingston's blend of perspectives, specifically traditional Chinese folktale and memoir. With this mixture, Kingston tries to provide her audience with the cultural, familial, and personal context needed to understand her unique position as a first-generation Chinese-American woman. Susan Stanford Friedman's assessment of autobiography with regard to women and minority groups explains Kingston's intricate blend of perspective and genre: women and cultural minorities often don't have the privilege of viewing themselves as individuals isolated from their gender or racial group. Kingston illustrates this condition through her use of Chinese talk-story, her mother's traditional Chinese perspective, and her own first-person view as a Chinese American. Plot summary The book is divided into five interconnected chapters, which read like short stories. =\\"No Name Woman\\"= In the first part of this chapter, the narrator is recounting how her mother once told her the story of the No-Name Woman. The chapter essentially opens as a vignette told from the mother's point of view. She tells the story of the No Name Woman, her husband's deceased sister. The middle portion of this chapter is Kingston's retelling of the No Name Woman Story. Kingston uses her own experiences with Chinese tradition and culture to substantiate alternate \\"versions\\" of the tale. At the end of \\"No Name Woman\\", Kingston reflects on the importance of her mother's story. She concludes that the real lesson is not how No Name Woman died; rather, why she was forgotten. =\\"White Tigers\\"= In the first part of \\"White Tigers\\", Kingston recounts her mother's talk-story of Fa Mu Lan, a woman warrior who took her father's place in battle. Kingston reverts to talking about her life in America and compares it to the story of Fa Mu Lan. She cannot gather the courage to speak up against her racist boss, let alone save her people in China. In the end, Kingston decides that she and Fa Mu Lan are similar. =\\"Shaman\\"= Using her mother's old diplomas and photos from her years in China, Kingston recounts the story of her mother's life as a lady scholar. Brave Orchid, Kingston's mother, returns home after two years of study. Kingston was born during World War II and grew up with her mother's talk-stories. Her mother taught her that all white people around her were \\"ghosts\\". =\\"At the Western Palace\\"= \\"At the Western Palace\\" opens with Brave Orchid, her two children, and her niece at San Francisco International Airport. Brave Orchid is waiting for her sister Moon Orchid to arrive from Hong Kong. Moon Orchid is emigrating to the United States after being separated from her sister for 30 years. The sisters arrive back at Brave Orchid's house in the Valley. They are greeted by Brave Orchid's husband, who has aged significantly in Moon Orchid's eyes. Moon Orchid spends the summer in Brave Orchid's house. Brave Orchid, her oldest son, Moon Orchid, and Moon Orchid's daughter drive South to Los Angeles. They are on a mission to find Moon Orchid's husband. At the end of the chapter, Moon Orchid declines in mental health and is forced to return to live with Brave Orchid. =\\"A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe\\"= In this story, Kingston reveals that her mother cut the membrane under her tongue. Kingston despises a Chinese girl who is a year older than she is because she refuses to talk. One day, she finds herself alone with the girl in the lavatory. Kingston writes about other eccentric stories. After Kingston screams to her mother and father that she does not want to be set up with the developmentally disabled boy, she launches into a laundry list of things she is and is not going to do, regardless of her mother's opinion. In the final part, Kingston tells the story of Ts'ai Yen, a poet born in A.D. 175. Themes =Necessity and extravagance= In an essay about The Woman Warrior, Sau-Ling Cynthia Wong writes about \\"the protagonist's struggle toward a balance between self-actualization and social responsibility... identified as 'Necessity' and 'Extravagance.'\\"Sau-ling p. 5. Language and narrative voice The language of The Woman Warrior invokes a complex juxtaposition of cultural and linguistic voices. Kingston tries to capture and emulate the nuances of Chinese speech through her prose.Huntley, pp. 35–36. Trying to transmit a Sinitic language by means of an Indo-European language was no easy task, and one that Kingston had to pursue actively. Nevertheless, The Woman Warrior is not pure talk-story. There is in fact a blending of first, second, and third person narration. The first-person narration of Kingston is her own American voice, the second-person is that of the Chinese talk-story, and the third-person (which only appears in \\"At the Western Palace\\") is a mixture; a talk-story transposed from Kingston's Chinese parents to her American siblings, and finally back to Kingston herself.Kingston, p. 163. What results from this combination of voices can only be described as a \\"fusion language\\" unique to Kingston, almost like her own type of Creole language. Writing in this \\"fusion language\\", which is an American language with Asian tones and accents, or rhythm, is a way that Kingston brings together Chinese and Western experiences. This \\"melding\\" of the two experiences – the images and metaphors—is what makes Kingston's style her own. Kingston admits that one of the ways she works to bring these two together is to speak Chinese while writing or typing in English.. Writing process The completion of The Woman Warrior came from Kingston's on-the-spot writing of her thoughts. She wrote down anything—until some of it started falling into place.\\"Biography of Maxine Hong Kingston\\", Voices from the Gaps, 6 March 2008. Retrieved 9 June 2010 via the Internet Archive. It was this habit that allowed Kingston to complete The Woman Warrior in just three years while teaching at a boarding school that demanded she be on call twenty-four hours a day.Lim, S. G. http://webct.stjohns.edu/webct/urw/lc121221401001.tp128493605001/RelativeResourceManager/sfsid/152385803001 The original title of The Woman Warrior was Gold Mountain Stories.Kingston, Maxine Hong. Interview by Jody Hoy. \\"To Be Able to See the Tao.\\" 1986. Chapter. Conversations With Maxine Hong Kingston. Ed. Skenazy and Martin. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1998. Print. p. 48 As Kingston states in a 1986 interview with Jody Hoy: \\"The publishers didn't like a title that sounds like a collection of short stories; they never like to publish collections of short stories. I wasn't that happy with either of those titles, I think that calling that book The Woman Warrior emphasizes 'warrior.' I'm not really telling the story of war, I want to be a pacifist.\\" In terms of Kingston's decision-making process in what to include and exclude from her story, she admits to using only what she deemed was \\"necessary\\" cultural imagery. She didn't want readers to approach her work as \\"exotic.\\" What cultural references she did allow to remain in The Woman Warrior she considered to be more \\"American-friendly.\\" This, of course, was a very subjective endeavor on her part, and, in a more recent reflection she had on The Woman Warrior, Kingston was quoted as calling the cultural references \\"really Chinese.\\". Criticism Since its publication in 1976, The Woman Warrior has maintained a \\"vexed reception history that both attests to its popularity and questions it.\\"Lim, J. http://webct.stjohns.edu/webct/urw/lc121221401001.tp128493605001/RelativeResourceManager/sfsid/165640994001 p. 49 Much of the debate concerns \\"autobiographical accuracy, cultural authenticity, and ethnic representativeness,\\". while the central concern is whether or not Kingston offers a faithful representation of Chinese and Chinese American culture.Lim, J. http://webct.stjohns.edu/webct/urw/lc121221401001.tp128493605001/RelativeResourceManager/sfsid/165640994001 Asian American scholars have expressed strong criticisms of The Woman Warrior. Writer Jeffery Paul Chan criticized Kingston for posing the book as non- fiction despite the many fictional elements of its stories. He stated that Kingston gave a distorted view of Chinese culture: one that is partially based on her own experience, but mostly fictional. Chan also noted Kingston's mistranslation of the Cantonese term, \\"ghost\\", and Benjamin R. Tong, another Asian American writer, stated that this mistranslation was done deliberately to \\"suit white tastes so that her book would sell better.\\"Sau-ling p. 3. Benjamin R.Tong. Jeffery Paul Chan. Tong further stated, based on The Woman Warrior's fictionalized elements and inaccuracies about Chinese culture and history, that Kingston manipulates her white audience by giving them what they think is Chinese culture, which in reality is only a caricature based on Western stereotypes of Chinese people.Sau-ling p. 17. Scholar Sheryl Mylan stated that Kingston constructs an Orientalist framework to separate herself from her mother and her culture, but in the process she replicates the ideologies of the American culture. Professor Sau-Ling Cynthia Wong stated that Kingston's \\"Orientalist effect\\" is the result of Kingston's failure to commensurately critique the patriarchal values or institutional racism of Western society, resulting in a lopsided and biased commentary regarding Chinese culture. Scholar David Li suggested that The Woman Warrior functions as \\"a means of contesting power between the dominant culture and the ethnic community; whose value lies in foregrounding the representational issues that have accompanied growth of Asian American creative and critical production.\\" Among the most caustic criticisms was author and playwright Frank Chin's, who accused Kingston of being \\"unChinese\\" and \\"a fake\\".Madison, p. 258. Chin criticized Kingston for giving her readers a fictional and exaggerated representation of Chinese people based on American stereotypes, and also criticized her readers for accepting these stereotypes.Madison, p. 268. Chin also accused Kingston of \\"practising an inauthentic Orientalism inherited from the apologetic autobiographies written in the Chinese American 'high' tradition.\\"Madison, p. 257. Frank Chin. In Kingston's defense, reviewer Deborah L. Madsen claimed that this accusation showed Chin's tendency to privilege the low, working-class tradition of Chinese American writing as \\"authentic\\", which is not Kingston's tradition. Madsen claimed that autobiographical Chinese American writing is full of competing discourses that differ both culturally and racially, and as Chinese American writers seek both Chinese ethnicity and American citizenship, the result may be \\"a subversion of racial authenticity\\", which she believed to be the case with Kingston.Madison, p. 260. Other reviewers, such as Jeehyun Lim, believed that the criticism accusing Kingston of representing the Chinese American community as barbaric \\"misreads her play with ideas of foreignness and nativeness.\\"Lim, J. http://webct.stjohns.edu/webct/urw/lc121221401001.tp128493605001/RelativeResourceManager/sfsid/165640994001 p. 62 In 1982, Kingston herself wrote a rebuttal essay entitled \\"Cultural Mis- readings by American Reviewers\\" in which she disparaged her critics whom she believed were insisting she represent the Chinese to some standard of excellence. \\"Why must I 'represent' anyone besides myself?\\" Kingston asked.Greenberg, Linda Margarita, Ph.D., Acts of Genre: Literary Form and Bodily Injury in Contemporary Chicana and Asian American Women's Literature. University of California, Los Angeles, 2009, 229 pages; AAT 3351749 Others, however, noted that Kingston's stories are fictional and therefore do not represent herself, either. The San Francisco Association of Chinese Teachers warned: \\"Especially for students unfamiliar with the Chinese background, [The Woman Warrior] could give an overly negative impression of the Chinese American experience.\\"Chinese American Literature Since the 1850s. p. 242. Even a Chinese American female scholar sympathetic to Kingston wrote that \\"for a minority author to exercise such artistic freedom is perilous business because white critics and reviewers persist in seeing [fictional] expressions by [Kingston] as no more than cultural history.\\" See also *Chinese American literature *List of Asian American writers References Bibliography *. .

The palaestra at Olympia is an ancient edifice in Olympia, Greece, part of the gymnasium at the sanctuary. It is a sixty-six metre by sixty-six metre, or 4345 metre square building that dates to the end of the 3rd or beginning of the 2nd century BC. It is thought to be a building in ancient Greece that was devoted to the training of wrestlers and other athletes. Architecture The palaestra is oriented precisely to the cardinal points and is very symmetrical in plan. Like all palaestra, the palaestra at Olympia is centered on a large courtyard covered with sand for use as a boxing or wrestling surface. Along all four sides of the palaestra are rooms that opened onto the porticoes. The building is entered through the south side through two separate doorways, each with Corinthian columns distyle in antis, thus immediately establishing symmetry within the plan of the structure. The doorways open into bench-lined vestibules leading to anterooms that open directly onto the southern portico. Between the two anterooms is a long, shallow hall lined with benches and faced with Ionic columns. This room is identified as the apodyterion, or undressing room, a space that would need to be close to the main entrance and have room for athletes and friends to meet. Directly across from the apodyterion, along the north side of the palaestra is the ephebion, or clubroom. This large, colonnaded hall is deeper than the apodyterion, but does not run the entire length of the courtyard. The entire north side of the palaestra has deep rooms, a feature mentioned by Vitruvius, which offered shelter from the sun. Also in the north side of the building is a doorway that leads directly into the rest of the adjoining gymnasium space. The room in the northeast corner of the palaestra is identified as a bathroom. The brick-lined, 4 meter square and 1.38 meter deep tank found here is dated to the Roman period, however. An unusual feature of the palaestra is the 24.20 by 5.44 meter strip of concrete pavement on the north side of courtyard, which is formed with alternate bands of ribbed and smooth tiles arranged to create continuous ridges stretching the length of the pavement. This was probably a sort of bowling alley, as suggested by a similar pavement found at Pompeii with heavy stone balls on it. It is not possible to say for what most of the other rooms lining the porticoes were used. Since Olympia had no resident population, the palaestra and gymnasium would not have included spaces for lectures or intellectual discourse and would have been used primarily by competitors in the sanctuary games. The stone benches found in six of rooms would certainly have been used by athletes and spectators rather than by intellectuals. The unidentified rooms of the palaestra would have included rooms such as the elaiothesion (\\"oiling place\\") and the konisterion (\\"dusting place\\"), rooms wherein the wrestlers anointed themselves with oil and sprinkled themselves with fine sand, and a few sphairisteria, which were rooms or open courts for ball play.

He ruled Egypt for at least 29 years although some Egyptologists think he could have ruled for as long as 30. The latter figure would be up to 2 years beyond this king's highest known date of Year 10 of the Whm Mswt era or Year 28 of his reign.Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, p.475 One scholar, Ad Thijs, has suggested that Ramesses XI could even have reigned as long as 33 years.Ad Thijs, \\"Reconsidering the End of the Twentieth Dynasty. Part III: Some Hitherto Unrecognised Documents from the Whm Mswt,\\" Göttinger Miszellen 173 (1999), pp. 175-192. It is believed that Ramesses ruled into his Year 29 since a graffito records that the general and High Priest of Amun Piankh returned to Thebes from Nubia on III Shemu day 23—or just 3 days into what would have been the start of Ramesses XI's 29th regnal year. Piankh is known to have campaigned in Nubia during Year 28 of Ramesses XI's reign (or Year 10 of the Whm Mswt) and would have returned home to Egypt in the following year. Background Ramesses XI was once thought to be the son of Ramesses X by Queen Tyti who was a King's Mother, King's Wife and King's Daughter in her titles.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 2004, p.191 However, recent scholarly research into certain copies of parts of the Harris papyrus (or Papyrus BM EA 10052)--made by Anthony Harris—which discusses a harem conspiracy against Ramesses III reveals that Tyti was rather a queen of pharaoh Ramesses III instead.Mark Collier, Aidan Dodson, & Gottfried Hamernik, P. BM 10052, Anthony Harris and Queen Tyti, JEA 96 (2010), pp.242-247 Hence, Ramesses XI's mother was not Tyti and although he could have been a son of his predecessor, this is not established either. Ramesses XI is believed to have married Tentamun, the daughter of Nebseny, with whom he is assumed to have fathered Duathathor- Henuttawy—the future wife of the high priest Pinedjem I. Ramesses XI may have had another daughter named Tentamun who became king Smendes' future wife in the next dynasty. Sometime during his reign, the High Priest of Amun, Amenhotep, was ousted from office by Pinehesy, the Viceroy of Kush who for some time took control of the Thebais. Although this “suppression of the High Priest of Amun” used to be dated quite early in the reign (prior to year 9 of the reign),Cyril Aldred, More Light on the Ramesside Tomb Robberies, in: J. Ruffle, G.A. Gaballa & K.A.. Kitchen (eds), Glimpses of Ancient Egypt, (Festschrift Fairman), Warminster 1979, 92-99 recently the communis opinio has changed to the view that it took place only shortly before the start of the Whm Mswt or Renaissance, an era which was inaugurated in regnal Year 19, probably to stress the return of normal conditions following the coup of Pinehesy. The whm-mswt era Mold with the name of Ramesses XI or IX at LACMA Ramesses XI's reign is notable for a large number of important papyri that have been discovered, including the Adoption Papyrus, which mentions regnal years 1 and 18 of his reign; Pap. B.M. 10052, Pap. Mayer A, Pap. B.M. 10403 and Pap. B.M. 10383 (the last four containing the accounts of tomb- robbery trials conducted during the first two years of the Whm Mswt); Pap. Ambras (containing a list of documents which were repurchased in year 6 of the Whm Mswt, after having been stolen from some temple archive, most probably during the chaotic period of the suppression of the High Priest of Amun Amenhotep);Ad Thijs, Reconsidering the End of the Twentieth Dynasty Part V, P. Ambras as an advocate of a shorter chronology, GM 179 (2000), 69-83 the Turin Taxation Papyrus, of an unspecified year 12; Pap. B.M. 10068, which includes on its verso two lists, called the House-list (from an unspecified year 12) and the Srmt-list (undated, but slightly later than the Houselist);Ad Thijs, Some observations on the Tomb-Robbery Papyri, in: A.I. Blöbaum, M. Eaton- Krauss, A. Wüthrich (eds), Pérégrinations avec Erhart Graefe, Festschrift zu seinem 75. Geburtstag (Ägypten und Altes Testament 87), 519-536. Pap. B.M. 9997, of an unspecified year 14 and 15; and an entire series of Late Ramesside Letters written by -among others- the scribes of the Necropolis Dhutmose, Butehamun, and the High Priest Piankh. Late Ramesside Letter no. 9 establishes that the Whm Mswt period lasted into a 10th year (which more or less equates year 28 proper of Ramesses XI).Late Ramesside Letter 9 in \\"Late Ramesside Letters\\" by Edward F. Wente, The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization (SAOC) 33, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, 1967. pp.11-12 & 37-38 Ad Thijs, in a GM 173 paper, notes that the House-list, which is anonymously dated to Year 12 of Ramesses XI (i.e., the document was compiled in either Year 12 of the pre- Renaissance period or during the Whm Mswt era itself), mentions two officials: the Chief Doorkeeper Pnufer, and the Chief Warehouseman Dhutemhab.Thijs, GM 173 (1999), pp. 185-86 These individuals were recorded as only an ordinary Doorkeeper and Warehouseman in Papyri BM 10403 and BM 10052 respectively, which are explicitly dated to Year 1 and 2 of the Whm Mswt period.Thijs, GM 173 (1999), pp. 185-86 This would suggest at first glance that the Year 12 House-list postdates these two documents and was created in Year 12 of the Whm Mswt era instead (or Regnal Year 30 proper of Ramesses XI), which would account for these two individuals' promotions. Thijs proceeds to use several anonymous Year 14 and 15 dates in another papyrus, BM 9997, to argue that Ramesses XI lived at least into his 32nd and 33rd Regnal Years (or Years 14 and 15 of the Whm Mswt). This document mentions a certain Sermont, who was only titled an ordinary Medjay (Nubian 'policeman') in the Year 12 House-list but is called \\"Chief of the Medjay\\" in Papyrus BM 9997. Sermont's promotion would thus mean that BM 9997 postdates the House-list Papyrus and must be placed late in the Renaissance period. If true, then Ramesses XI should have survived into his 33rd Regnal Year or Year 15 of the Whm Mswt era before dying. However, one could argue that there are occasional inconsistencies in the description of an individual's precise title even within the same source document itself: Whereas Papyrus Mayer A several times mentions a “Dhuthope, Chief Doorkeeper of the temple of Amun”, in col. 5, line 15 this same individual is clearly presented as a mere “Doorkeeper”, which would strongly weaken Thijs’ case.T. E. Peet, The Mayer Papyri A & B, London 1920 On the other hand, as Goelet notes with regard to this last entry: “instead of recounting the usual beatings and confessions, the record simply states: ‘There was brought the doorkeeper Djehuty-hotep’”.O. Goelet, JEA 82 (1996), 121 Since there are no further details added, which is an anomaly within the papyrus, this suggests that the pertinent entry was abandoned by the scribe, perhaps because he realised that he had made a mistake. Nevertheless, Thijs' case for a Year 33 proper for Ramesses XI should be treated with caution. Since there are two attested promotions of individuals in 2 separate papyri, however, there is a possibility that Ramesses XI did live into his 33rd regnal Year. Thijs in his GM 173 paper, also demonstrated that the House-list and the Turin Taxation papyrus were close in time to each other since both documents mention a year 12 date and name certain individuals such as the chief of the Medjay Nesamun, the herdsman Penhasi and the fisherman Kadore.Thijs, GM 173, p.187 Due to this connection, Thijs argued that the Taxation Papyrus also belonged to the whm-mswt era. However, this would imply that in year 12 of the whm-mswt the viceroy Pinehesy returned to office to supervise in the collection of taxes in the Theban area, after he had become an enemy of the state earlier in the era, due to his role in temporarily suppressing the High Priest Amenhotep.Jaroslav Cerny, Egypt: From the Death of Ramesses III to the End of the Twenty-first Dynasty', in I.E.S. Edwards, C.J. Gadd, N.G.L. Hammond and E. Sollberger (eds), Cambridge Ancient History Vol. II, Pt. 2, 634. 1965 (reprinted 1975) Cambridge University Press: Cambridge In P. BM 10383 2, 4-5 (from year 2 of the whm-mswt, although the era is not explicitly mentioned in the heading) a certain Peison states that, sometime earlier, Pinehesy suppressed his (viz., Peison's) superior, which is taken by most Egyptologists as a reference to Pinehesy ousting the High Priest Amenhotep. Pinehesy was subsequently designated as an enemy in several papyri from year 1 and 2 of the whm-mswt (equalling year 19 and 20 proper of Ramesses XI) where his name was consistently associated \\"by the nDs [or] (‘bad’) bird as its determinative\\" in these papyri.The High Priests of Amun at the End of the Twentieth Dynasty by Jennifer Palmer, Birmingham Egyptologial Journal (2014), pp.7-9 How exactly the anarchic period of the Suppression was ended and who ultimately forced Pinehesy out of Thebes is unknown, due to a lack of explicit sources. However, it seems that Pinehesy retreated to Nubia and succeeded in maintaining some sort of powerbase there for over a decade. In year 10 of the whm-mswt the then general and High Priest Piankh goes on an expedition to Nubia to \\"meet Pinehesy\\". Although it is often postulated that it was the aim of this campaign to fight the former Viceroy,László Török, The Kingdom of Kush: Handbook of the Napatan-Meriotic Civilization, Brill Academic Publishers 1997 this is by no means certain. The sources are actually ambiguous on this point and the political climate may well have changed over the years. There is some evidence that at this time Piankh may no longer have been a loyal servant of Ramesses XI, which allows for the possibility that he was secretly negotiating with Pinehesy,A. Niwiński, in: I. Gamer-Wallert & W. Helck (eds), Gegengabe (Festschrift Emma Brunner-Traut), Tübingen 1992, 257-258Ad Thijs, \\"I was thrown out from my city\\" -Fecht's views on Pap.

In the same letter and two others (LRL no. 34 and no. 35) Piankh gives the order to the Scribe of the Necropolis Tjaroy (=Dhutmose), the lady Nodjmet and a certain Payshuuben to secretly arrest and question two Medjay policemen about certain things they had apparently said:E. Wente, Late Ramesside Letters, SAOC 33, 1967, p.53 Whereas Piankh would probably have had the authority to have people executed, it is noteworthy that his correspondents are explicitly urged to keep the matter secret. It has been argued that, given Piankh's supreme position at the time, the secrecy can only have concerned the king.Ad Thijs, The Troubled Careers of Amenhotep and Panehsy: The High Priest of Amun and the Viceroy of Kush under the Last Ramessides, SAK 31 (2003), 301-302Jennifer Palmer, Birmingham Egyptology Journal 2014.2, 10-11 If this is correct, it follows that the political situation of the time must have been very complex, with Piankh possibly acting on some hidden agenda. Unfortunately, due to the very limited nature of the sources, the exact relationships between the three main protagonists, Piankh, Pinehesy and Ramesses XI remain far from clear. Some scholars believe that the Nubian campaign was part of an ongoing power struggle between the High Priest of Amun and the Viceroy of Kushe.g. Jennifer Palmer, Birmingham Egyptology Journal 2014.2, 11 However, it is equally possible that Piankh came to the rescue of Pinehesy against some common enemy. The verb often translated as \\"to attack (Pinehesy)\\" only means \\"to meet/ to go to\\".E. Wente, Late Ramesside Letters, SAOC 33, 1967, 24, 25 In fact, neither the aim of the expedition nor its outcome are beyond doubt. The issue is further complicated by the ongoing debate about [1] the order of High Priests (either Herihor before Piankh or Piankh before Herihor)Karl Jansen-Winkeln, Das Ende des Neuen Reiches, ZAS 119 (1992), pp.22-37 and [2] the correct ascription (either to the pre-Renaissance period or to the whm-mswt itself) of several documents from the reign of Ramesses XI.Ad Thijs, Once More, the Length of the Ramesside Renaissance, GM 240 (2014) pp.69-81 At present, Thijs' suggestion that Pinehesy was apparently rehabilitated by Ramesses XI in year 11 or 12 of the whm-mswt has only been explicitly accepted by the Egyptologist A. Dodson.Aidan Dodson, Afterglow of Empire, Egypt from the Fall of the New Kingdom to the Saite Renaissance, AUC Press 2012, p. 16, 19-21. Length of reign Neither the length of the Renaissance nor the ascription of certain documents from the reign of Ramesses XI are beyond dispute. At present, Thijs' proposal that Papyrus BM 10054 dates to the Whm-Mswt has been confirmed by other scholars such as Von Beckerath and Annie Gasse—the latter in a JEA 87 (2001) paper which studied several newly discovered fragments belonging to this document.Annie Gasse, \\"Panakhemipet et ses complices (À propos du papyrus BM EA 10054, R° 2, 1–5)\\", JEA 87 (2001), pp.81-92 Consequently, it would appear that Ramesses XI's highest undisputed date is presently Year 11 of the Whm-Mswt (or Year 29 proper) of his reign, when Piankh's Nubian campaign terminated which means that the pharaoh had a minimum reign of 29 years when he died—-which can perhaps be extended to 30 years due to the \\"gap between the beginning of Dynasty 21 and the reign of Ramesses XI.\\"Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p.475 with 33 years being hypothetical. Krauss and Warburton specifically write that due to the existence of this time gap, : Egyptologists generally concede that his reign could have ended 1 or 2 years later than year 10 of the wehem mesut era = regnal year 28.Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, p.475 Aidan Dodson, however, allows for a 'year 15' of the Whm-Mswt on the basis of P. BM 9997.Aidan Dodson, Afterglow of Empire, Egypt from the Fall of the New Kingdom to the Saite Renaissance, AUC Press 2012, p. 12. Either during the reign of Ramesses XI or shortly afterwards, the village of Deir El Medina was abandoned, apparently because the Royal Necropolis was shifted northward to Tanis and there was no further need for their services at Thebes. Late New Kingdom chronology of Ramesses XI The conventional Egyptian chronology view is that Ramesses XI had an independent reign of between 29 and 30 or 33 full years between Ramesses X and Smendes before dying. Shortly before his death, he transferred Egypt's political capital to Tanis where he died and was buried by Smendes who succeeded him but only ruled Lower Egypt while Herihor ruled Upper Egypt as the High Priest of Egypt at Thebes. Thijs' separate proposal that the first 17 years of Ramesses XI's reign were entirely contemporary with the reigns of Ramesses IX (Years 5-19) and Ramesses X (Years 1-3)Ad Thijs, Pap. Turin 2018, the journeys of the scribe Dhutmose and the career of the Chief Workman Bekenmut, GM 199 (2004), pp.79-88 is not currently accepted by most Egyptologists except Aidan Dodson in his 2012 book Afterglow of Empire.see this book review by David Aston in Egyptian Archaeology, February 2014 Burial Sometime during this troubled period, Ramesses XI died under unknown circumstances. While he had a tomb prepared for himself in the Valley of the Kings (KV4), it was left unfinished and only partly decorated since Ramesses XI instead arranged to have himself buried away from Thebes, possibly near Memphis. This pharaoh's tomb, however, includes some unusual features, including four rectangular, rather than square, pillars in its burial chamber and an extremely deep central burial shaft– at over 30 feet or 10 metres long– which was perhaps designed as an additional security device to prevent tomb robbery.Nicholas Reeves & Richard H. Wilkinson, The Complete Valley of the Kings, Thames & Hudson Ltd., 1996. p.173 During the 21st dynasty, under the reign of the High Priest of Thebes, Pinedjem I,Reeves & Wilkinson, p.173 Ramesses XI's tomb was used as a workshop for processing funerary materials from the burials of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III and perhaps Thutmose I. Ramesses XI's tomb has stood open since antiquity and was used as a dwelling by the Copts.Reeves & Nicholson, p.172 Since Ramesses XI had himself buried in Lower Egypt, Smendes rose to the kingship of Egypt, based on the well known custom that he who buried the king inherited the throne. Since Smendes buried Ramesses XI, he could legally assume the crown of Egypt and inaugurate the 21st Dynasty from his hometown at Tanis, even if he did not control Middle and Upper Egypt, which were now effectively in the hands of the High Priests of Amun at Thebes.

Released on 31 January 2001, USCNS/21 was the most exhaustive review of US national security strategy since the National Security Act of 1947. USCNS/21 was released in three distinct phases. The first phase, New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century (see further below), anticipates the emerging international security environment within the first quarter of the 21st century and examines how the US fits into that environment. The second phase, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert for Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom (see further below), proposes a new US national security strategy based on the anticipated threats and conditions outlined in the first phase report. The third phase, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (see further below), recommends changes to the US government's structure, legislation, and policy to reflect a new national security strategy based on the anticipated 21st century international security environment.

Hoffman Phase I report – New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century was the first report completed by the Commission. Released on 15 September 1999, it attempts to provide a picture of the international security environment within the first quarter of the 21st century and the anticipated role of the US in that environment. The Commission anticipates an increasingly technologically, economically, and socially integrated world, i.e. increasing globalization amidst social and political fragmentation. The report provides twelve basic assumptions of that environment and fourteen conclusions based on those assumptions. =Assumptions= > *An economically strong United States is likely to remain a primary > political, military, and cultural force through 2025, and will thus have a > significant role in shaping the international environment. *The stability > and direction of American society and politics will help shape US foreign > policy goals and capacities, and hence the way the US may affect the global > future. *Science and technology will continue to advance and become more > widely available and utilized around the world, but their benefits will be > less evenly distributed. *World energy supplies will remain largely based on > fossil fuels. *While much of the world will experience economic growth, > disparities in income will increase and widespread poverty will persist. > *The international aspects of business and commerce (trade, transportation, > telecommunications, investment and finance, manufacturing, and professional > services) will continue to expand. *Non-governmental organizations (refugee > aid organizations, religious and ethnic advocacy groups, environmental and > other single-issue lobbies, international professional associations, and > others) will continue to grow in importance, numbers, and in their > international role. *Though it will raise important issues of sovereignty, > the US will find in its national interest to work with and strengthen a > variety of international organizations. *The US will remain the principal > military power in the world. *Weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, > chemical, and biological) and weapons of mass disruption (information > warfare) will continue to proliferate to a wider range of state and non- > state actors. Maintenance of a robust nuclear deterrent therefore remains > essential as well as investment in new forms of defense against these > threats. *We should expect conflicts in which adversaries, because of > cultural affinities different from our own, will resort to forms and levels > of violence shocking to our sensibilities. *As the US confronts a variety of > complex threats, it will often be dependent on allies; but it will find > reliable alliances more difficult to establish and > sustain.http://www.milnet.com/hart-rudman/nwc.htm. =Conclusions= > *America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack on our > homeland, and our military superiority will not help us. *Rapid advances in > information and biotechnologies will create new vulnerabilities for US > security. *New technologies will divide the world as well as draw it > together. *The national security of all advanced states will be increasingly > affected by the vulnerabilities of the evolving global economic > infrastructure. *Energy will continue to have major strategic significance. > *All borders will be more porous; some will bend and some will break. *The > sovereignty of states will come under pressure, but will endure. > *Fragmentation or failure of states will occur, with destabilizing effects > on neighboring states. *Foreign crises will be replete with atrocities and > the deliberate terrorizing of civilian populations. *Space will become a > critical and competitive military environment. *The essence of war will not > change. *US intelligence will face more challenging adversaries, and even > excellent intelligence will not prevent all surprises. *The US will be > called upon frequently to intervene militarily in a time of uncertain > alliances and with the prospect of fewer forward deployed forces. *The > emerging security environment in the next quarter century will require > different military and other national capabilities.USCNS/21, New World > Coming: American Security in the 21st Century (Washington, DC: US Government > Printing Office, September 1999), 138-141. Phase II report – Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert for Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom Released on 15 April 2000, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert for Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom proposes a new national security strategy based on the anticipated 21st century international security environment. The new strategy must consider how to minimize the potential destabilizing effects of the contradictory trends of globalization and political fragmentation while promoting US interests and values worldwide. =Strategic considerations= In developing this new strategy, the Commission suggests a number of strategic considerations: > *Strategy and policy must be grounded in the national interest. *The > maintenance of America's strength is a long-term commitment and cannot be > assured without conscious, dedicated effort. *The US faces unprecedented > opportunities as well as dangers in the new era. *The US must find new ways > to join with other capable and like-minded nations. *This nation must set > priorities and apply them consistently. *America must never forget that it > stands for certain principles, most importantly freedom under the rule of > law.USCNS/21, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert For Preserving Security > and Promoting Freedom(Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, April > 2000), 6-7. =Suggested categorization of US national interests= Building on these considerations, the Commission suggests categorizing US national interests into three categories: survival, critical, and significant. Survival interests are defined as, \\"without which America would cease to exist as we know it\\".USCNS/21, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert For Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, April 2000), 7. These interests encompass safety from direct attacks by hostile states and terrorists through the use of weapons of mass destruction. They also include preserving America's founding principles as outlined in the US Constitution. Critical interests are defined as, \\"causally one step removed from survival interests\\". These interests lie in the continuation of key global systems, such as global energy, economic, communications, transportation, and health infrastructures. Other critical interests include the security of US allies and preventing potentially hostile alliances from being formed to threaten US national security. Significant interests, \\"importantly affect the global environment in which the US must act\\". These interests include spreading democracy abroad and ensuring basic human rights for all the world's citizens. =Priority objectives= Using these strategic considerations as a foundation, the Commission recommends the following as the priority objectives to the new national security strategy: *\\"Defend the US and ensure that it is safe from the dangers of a new era\\".USCNS/21, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert For Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, April 2000), 8. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism will be the gravest threat to US national security in the 21st century. These threats must be taken seriously and the highest priority must be given to prevention and deterrence from such attacks. *\\"Maintain social cohesion, economic competitiveness, technological ingenuity, and military strength\\".USCNS/21, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert For Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, April 2000), 9. The US must re-focus on education, specifically in the sciences, to ensure its technological dominance in the 21st century. Furthermore, the US must reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and investigate other energy alternatives. *\\"Assist the integration of key major powers, especially China, Russia, and India, into the mainstream of the emerging international system\\". The US must engage emerging, and in Russia's case re-emerging, world powers and work to foster their integration into the world's economy. However, the US must not lose sight of its own interests. These relationships are especially important in relation to the US's effort to limiting nuclear proliferation; cooperation with these powers is absolutely necessary. *\\"Promote, with others, the dynamism of the new global economy and improve the effectiveness of international institutions and international law\\".USCNS/21, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert For Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom, (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, April 2000), 10. The US, along with the G7, must successfully manage the effects, both positive and negative, of globalization on the world stage. *\\"Adapt US alliances and other regional mechanisms to a new era in which America's partners seek greater autonomy and responsibility\\".USCNS/21, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert For Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, April 2000), 11. The US must maintain its current alliances and relationships with other nations as a mechanism to preserve and foster international peace and security. *\\"Help the international community tame the disintegrative forces spawned by an era of change\\".USCNS/21, Seeking a National Strategy: A Concert For Preserving Security and Promoting Freedom (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, April 2000), 13. The US must work with the international community to address and manage the problem of failed states. Phase III report – Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change Released on 31 January 2001, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change suggests \\"significant changes must be made in the structures and processes of the US national security apparatus\\".USCNS/21, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, February 2001), viii. The Commission believes that without these reforms, \\"American power and influence cannot be sustained\\".USCNS/21, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, February 2001), iv. Five key areas are highlighted for reform, followed by the Commissions specific recommendations for each area. =Recommendations= > *ensuring the security of the American homeland *recapitalizing America's > strengths in science and education *redesigning key institutions of the > Executive Branch *overhauling the US government personnel system > *reorganizing Congress's role in national security affairs =Securing the national homeland= The Commission believes that the combination of weapons proliferation and terrorism will result in increased vulnerability to the US homeland. \\"A direct attack against American citizens on American soil is likely over the next quarter century\\". In order protect the homeland against this threat, the Commission suggests: Structure of proposed National Homeland Security Agency, February 2001 *\\"the creation of a new independent National Homeland Security Agency (NHSA) with responsibility for planning, coordinating, and integrating various government activities involved in homeland security\\" *\\"that a new office of Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security be created to oversee the various Department of Defense activities and ensure that the necessary resources are made available\\"USCNS/21, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, February 2001), ix. *\\"that the National Guard be given homeland security as a primary mission, as the US Constitution itself ordains\\" *\\"that Congress reorganize itself to accommodate this Executive Branch realignment, and that it also form a special select committee for homeland security to provide Congressional support and oversight in this critical area\\" =Recapitalizing America's strengths in science and education= The Commission finds that the scientific and educational systems of the US are in \\"serious crisis\\". It notes how the US is in danger of lagging behind other countries in this arena. \\"In the next quarter century, we will likely see ourselves surpassed, and in relative decline, unless we make a conscious national commitment to maintain our edge\\".< The report further highlights the Commission's belief that this decline in emphasis on science and education is the gravest threat to US national security, even over weapons proliferation and terrorism. The Commission recommends: *\\"doubling the federal research and development budget by 2010, and instituting a more competitive environment for the allotment of those funds\\" *\\"that the role of the President's Science Advisor be elevated to oversee these and other critical tasks, such as the resuscitation of the national laboratory system and the institution of better inventory stewardship over the nation's science and technology assets\\" *\\"a new National Security Science and Technology Education Act to fund a comprehensive program to produce the needed numbers of science and engineering professionals as well as qualified teachers in science and math\\" =Institutional redesign= The Commission finds that the US government has failed to restructure itself to the post–Cold War world. It recommends significant restructuring to re-align government offices, branches, and procedures with the global realities of the 21st century as well as ensure that,\\"strategy once again drives the design and implementation of US national security policies\\".USCNS/21, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, February 2001), x. The Commission urges Congress to expand its understanding of national security matters, and streamline the appropriations and authorizations committees to make intelligence and security related legislation more efficient and effective. The Commission also recommends: Structure of the Department of State, February 2001 Proposed restructuring of the Department of State, February 2001 *that \\"the President personally guide a top-down strategic planning process and that process should be linked to the allocation of resources throughout the government\\" *that \\"legislative, press communications, and speech-writing functions should reside in the White House staff, not separately in the National Security Council staff as they do today\\"USCNS/21, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, February 2001), xi. *\\"that the Secretary of the Treasury be named a statutory member of the National Security Council\\" *that \\"the President should abolish the National Economic Council, distributing its domestic economic policy responsibilities to the Domestic Policy Council\\" *\\"the creation of five Under Secretaries with the responsibility for overseeing the regions of Africa, Asia, Europe, Inter-America, and Near East/South Asia, and a redefinition of the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Global Affairs\\" *\\"that the activities of the US Agency for International Development be fully integrated into this new State Department organization\\" *\\"that the new Secretary of Defense reduce by ten to fifteen percent the staffs of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the military services, and the regional commands\\"USCNS/21, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, February 2001), xii. *that \\"the Secretary of Defense should establish a ten-year goal of reducing infrastructure costs by 20-25 percent through steps to consolidate, restructure, outsource, and privatize many Department of Defense support agencies and activities as possible\\" *that \\"the Secretary of Defense should move the Quadrennial Defense Review to the second year of a Presidential term\\" *\\"that the Secretary of Defense introduce a new process that requires the Services and defense agencies to compete for the allocation of some resources within the overall defense budget\\" *\\"establishing and employing a two-track acquisition system, one for major acquisitions and a 'fast track' for a modest number of potential breakthrough systems, especially those in the area of command and control\\" *that \\"the Secretary of Defense should direct the Department of Defense to shift from the threat-based, force sizing process to one which measure requirements against recent operational activity trends, actual intelligence estimates of potential adversaries' capabilities, and national security objectives as defined in the new administration's national security strategy - once formulated\\" *\\"that the Defense Department devote its highest priority to improving and further developing its expeditionary capabilities\\" *\\"the establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Space (IWGS)\\"USCNS/21, Roadmap for National Security: Imperative for Change (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, February 2001), xiv. *\\"that the intelligence community should emphasize the recruitment of human intelligence sources on terrorism as one of the intelligence community's highest priorities\\" and \\"the community should place new emphasis on collection and analysis of economic and science/technology security concerns, and incorporate more open source intelligence into its analytical products\\" See also *Federal government of the United States *United States Department of Homeland Security *United States Intelligence Community *National Intelligence Strategy of the United States of America *Intelligence cycle management *Homeland Security *USA PATRIOT Act *Partnership for a Secure America References External links *US Commission on National Security/21st Century *National Security in the 21st Century: Findings of the Hart-Rudman Commission *The Hart - Rudman Commission and the Homeland Defense *National Security Watch - USCNS/21: A Hart-Rudman Commission Primer *Hart - Rudman Calls For Homeland Defense *Recommendations of Hart - Rudman National Security Report: Education *Hart - Rudman Commission Report - A Critique *Newt Gingrich's Last Boondoggle: The Hart - Rudman National Security Commission shows every sign of being an expensive flop *A Year After 9/11, America Still Unprepared For A Terrorist Attack, Warns New Hart-Rudman Task Force On Homeland Security *America - Still Unprepared, Still In Danger *Revisiting the Hart - Rudman Commission Further reading *Intelligence: From Secrets to Policy, by Mark Lowenthal *Intelligence Analysis: A Target Centric Approach, by Robert M.

Originally published: 15 December 1998. Online version last updated 19 January 2012 or harmel, (among other similar pronunciations and spellings), is a perennial, herbaceous plant, with a woody underground root-stock, of the family Nitrariaceae, usually growing in saline soils in temperate desert and Mediterranean regions. Its common English-language name came about because of a resemblance to rue (which is not related). Because eating it can cause livestock to sicken or die, it is considered a noxious weed in a number of countries. It has become an invasive species in some regions of the western United States. The plant is popular in Middle Eastern and north African folk medicine. The alkaloids contained in the plant, including the seeds, are hallucinogenic, possibly due to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, thus it is sold in the West for recreational drug use. Etymology \\"African-rue\\" is often used in North American English. \\"Harmel\\" is used in India, Algeria, and Morocco. It is known in as اسپند in Persian, which is transliterated as espand, or ispand but may also be pronounced or transliterated as \\"sepand\\", \\"sipand\\", \\"sifand\\", \\"esfand\\", \\"isfand\\", \\"aspand\\", or \\"esphand\\" depending on source or dialect. The Persian word \\"اسپند\\" is also the name of the last month of the year, approximately March, in the traditional Persian calendar. It is derived from Middle Persian \\"spand\\", which is thought, along with the English word \\"spinach\\", to be ultimately derived from Proto-Iranian *spanta-, \\"holy\\" (compare Avestan 𐬯𐬞𐬆𐬧𐬙𐬀, spəṇta, \\"holy\\", and Middle Persian \\"spenāg\\", \\"holy\\"), itself thought to be ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *ḱwen-. It is known as \\"spilani\\" in Pashto. In Urdu it is known as \\"harmal\\", \\"ispand\\" or \\"isband\\". In Turkish it is known as uzerlik or sedefotu. In Chinese it is 驼驼蒿, tuó tuó hāo, or 骆驼蓬, luo tuó peng. In Spain it is known as hármala, alharma or gamarza, amongst dozens of other local names. In French it is known as harmal. Description Peganum harmala – MHNT =Habitus= It is a perennial, herbaceous, suffrutescent, hemicryptophyte plant, which dies off in the winter, but regrows from the rootstock the following spring. It can grow to about tall, but normally it is about tall. The entire plant is hairless (glabrous). Plants are bad tasting and smell foul when crushed. =Stems= Numerous erect to spreading stems grow from the crown of the root-stock in the spring, these branch in a corymbose fashion. =Roots= The roots of the plant can reach a depth of up to , if the soil where it is growing is very dry. The roots can grow to thick. =Leaves= The leaves are alternate, sessile, and have bristly, long stipules at the base. The leaf blade is dissected/forked twice or more into three to five thin, linear to lanceolate- linear, greyish lobes. The forks are irregular. The lobes have smooth margins, are long and broad, and end in points. Peganum harmala styles. =Flowers= It blooms with solitary flowers opposite to the leaves on the apical parts of branches. It flowers between March and October in India, between April and October in Pakistan, between May and June in China, between March and April in Israel, and between May and July in Morocco. The flowers are white or yellowish white, and are about 2–3 cm in diameter. Greenish veins are visible in the petals. They have a threadlike, 1.2 cm long pedicel. The flowers have five (10-)12–15(−20)mm long, linear, pointy-ended, glabrous, sepals, often divided into lobes, although often entire and sometimes only divided at the end. There are five petals which are oblong-elliptic, obovate to oblong in shape, (10-)14–15(−20)mm long, (5-)6–8(−9)mm broad, and ending with an obtuse apex. The flowers are hermaphroditic, having both male and female organs. The flowers usually have 15 stamens (rarely fewer); these have a 4-5mm long filament with an enlarged base. The dorsifixed, 6mm long anthers are longer than the filaments. The ovary is superior, and has 3 locules and ends in an 8-10mm long style, the ending 6mm of which are triangular or 3-keeled in cross-section. The ovary is surrounded by a nectary which is glabrous and has five lobes in a regular pattern. The flowers produce only a tiny amount of nectar. The nectar is rich in hexose sugars. It contains a relatively small concentration of amino acids among which there is an especially high amount of the glutamic acid, tyrosine and proline, the last of which can be tasted by, and is favoured by, many insects. It also contains (four) alkaloids, in relatively high concentration compared to the flowers of other species, among them the toxins harmalol and harmine. The proportions and concentrations of the alkaloids in the nectar are different than in the other organs of the plant, indicating an adaptive reason for their presence. =Pollen= P. harmala has smallish, tricolpate pollen grains with a rugulate-reticulate surface. The exine has a sexine which is thicker than the nexine. These grains are well distinguishable from pollen of related plants (Nitraria) in Pakistan. Peganum harmala fruit =Fruit= The plant fruits between July and November in China. The fruit is a dry, round seed capsule which measures about 6–10(−15) mm in diameter, These seed capsules have three chambers and carry more than 50 seeds. The end of the fruit is usually somewhat sunken inwards and retains a persistent style. Seeds =Seeds= The seeds are colored dark brown to blackish-brown, slightly curved, triangular, about long with a muriculate surface. The endosperm is oily. =Cytology= The cells have 24 chromosomes (2n), although sometimes 22 have been found. Distribution =Native= Peganum harmala is native to a wide area stretching from Morocco in north Africa and Spain and Italy in Europe, north to Serbia, Romania (possibly), Dagestan and Kazakhstan, south to Mauritania (possibly), Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Pakistan, and east to western Mongolia, northern China and possibly Bangladesh. It is a common weed in Afghanistan, Iran, parts of Israel, eastern and central Anatolia (Turkey), and Morocco. In Africa it is known from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. It likely doesn't occur in Mauritania. In Morocco it is quite common and occurs throughout the country, excepting Western Sahara. In Algeria it is found mostly in the north bordering Morocco and Tunisia, being absent in the south and central regions. It is reasonably commonly found throughout Tunisia. In Libya it is found in the maritime zone, especially around Bengazi, and is not abundant. In Egypt it grows in the Sinai, has been recorded from the east of the Eastern Desert, and been rarely collected on the mid-west of the Mediterranean coast. In Europe it is native to Spain, Corsica (disputed), much of Russia, Serbia, Moldova, Ukraine (especially in Crimea), Romania (possibly introduced), Bulgaria, Greece (including Crete and the Cyclades), Cyprus, Turkey (Thrace) and southern Italy (including Sardinia, but not Sicily). It also is native to the Caucasus: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. On the Iberian Peninsula it is absent from Portugal and Andorra, but it is not uncommon in Spain, especially in the southeast, the Ebro depression, and the inland valleys of the Duero and Tajo, but it is rare in Andalusia (south) and it does not occur on the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, and in the west along the Portuguese border, Galicia, the northern coast, and the northern mountain ranges. In Turkey it is found both in Thrace and across most of Anatolia, but is absent from the northern Black Sea coast. It is abundant in some regions of south and central Anatolia. In Israel it is most commonly found around the Dead Sea, in the Judean mountains and desert, in the Negev and its surrounding areas, including areas in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, being rare or very rare in the northern mountains, Galilee, coastal areas and the Arava valley. It grows in drier parts of the northern half of India but is possibly only native to the Kashmir and Ladakh regions. It also occurs in, and is possibly native to, Bangladesh. The distribution in China is in dispute. The 2008 Flora of China considers it to be native to northern China in the provinces of Gansu, western Hebei, western Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, northern Shanxi, Tibet and Xinjiang. The 2017 Species Catalogue of China considers it to be restricted to Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Gansu. =Adventive distribution= It has been added to the lists of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species for the countries of South Africa, Mexico, France and Ukraine, although it is not reported as having a negative impact in any of these countries. Most Ukrainian and other references consider the plant native to Ukraine. Sources are in disagreement regarding rare collections in coastal Romania, but many consider it introduced. At least 7 occurrences have been registered in South Africa, and none in Mexico (as of 2017). One database has it occurring as a non-native in Hungary. In France it is considered a former accidental introduction once uncommonly found on the Côte d'Azur along the Mediterranean coast. It has very rarely been found elsewhere in France in the past. According to the Flora Europaea there is a native population on Corsica, however, according to Tela Botanica it does not occur on the island, either as a native or not. It was first planted in the United States in 1928 in New Mexico by a farmer wanting to manufacture a dye called \\"Turkish red\\" from its seeds. From here the plant spread over most of southern New Mexico and the Big Bend region of Texas. An additional spread has occurred from east of Los Angeles in California to the tip of southernmost Nevada. Outside of these regions the distribution in the USA is not continuous and localised. As of 2019 it has been reported in southern Arizona (in at least 3 adjacent counties), northeastern Montana (2 adjacent counties), northern Nevada (Churchill county), Oregon (town of Prineville in the Oregon high desert) and possibly Washington. \\"Because it is so drought tolerant, African rue can displace the native saltbushes and grasses growing in the salt-desert shrub lands of the Western U.S.\\" Although the distribution in New Mexico and Texas would suggest it has spread to parts of northern Mexico, the species has not been included in the 2004 list of introduced plants of Mexico. Habitat and ecology It grows in dry areas in the United States. It can be considered a halophyte. In Kashmir and Ladakh it is known from elevations of 300–2400 m, in China 400–3600 m, in Turkey 0–1500 m, and in Spain 0–1200 m. In China it grows in slightly saline sands near oases and dry grasslands in desert areas. In Spain it can be found in abandoned fields, rubbish tips, stony slopes, along the verges of roads, ploughed and worked earth, as well as in disturbed, saline scrubland. In Morocco it is said to grow in steppes, arid coasts, dry uncultivated fields and amongst ruins. A study in Morocco found that it could be used as an indicator species for rangeland degraded from agricultural activities, when found in association with certain Artemisia sp., Noaea mucronata and Anabasis aphylla. In Israel it is a common dominant plant along with Anabasis syriaca and Haloxylon scoparium in a low semi-shrubby steppe ecosystem which during dry years is almost devoid of plant cover, growing on saline, loess-derived soils. In rainy times Leontice leontopetalum and Ixiolirion tataricum appear here. It also grows in Israel in semi-steppe shrublands, Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands, and deserts. Between 800-1300m elevation on the sandstone slopes of the mountains around Petra, Jordan, there is an open Mediterranean steppe forest dominated by Juniperus phoenicea and Artemisia herba-alba together with occasional trees of Pistacia atlantica and Crataegus aronia with common shrubs being Thymelaea hirsuta, Ephedra campylopoda, Ononis natrix, Hammada salicornia and Anabasis articulata; when this habitat is further degraded (it is already degraded) by ovegrazing P. harmala along with Noaea mucronata invade. It is often found with Euphorbia virgata in the foothills of Mt. Ararat, Igdir Province, Turkey. The flowers are pollinated by insects. Little is known about pollen vectors. A year-long study around the town of St. Katherine in the El-Tur mountains of southern Sinai found P. harmala to be exclusively pollinated by the domesticated honey bee, Apis mellifera, although it is possible these animals are displacing native bees. The floral morphology, nectar amount and composition -high in hexane sugars, presence of toxic alkaloids and high proline content together suggest pollination by short-tongued bees (see pollination syndrome). Regarding seed dispersal it is considered a barochore. According to a Mongolian study, its seeds are exclusively dispersed by human activities, although Peganum multisectum, sometimes seen as a variety or synonym of this species, is dispersed solely by water flow. A species of tiny, hairy beetle, Thamnurgus pegani, has been found inhabiting stems of P. harmala in Turkey and elsewhere. It feeds only on P. harmala. When the aerial parts of the plant begin to die off in the autumn, the adult beetles retreat to overwinter in the soil underneath the root-crown, or in old larval tunnels in the dead stems; emerging in the spring (May in Turkey), the females bore small holes in the now shooting stems of the plant, in which they lay their eggs. The hatched larvae bore inward toward the pith. The beetles somehow infect the surrounding tissue in the tunnels with a fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. The infected plant tissue turns blackish and is then used by the adult beetles and their larvae as a food source, until they are ready to pupate within the stem tunnels. It has been proposed as a candidate for using in biological control of P. harmala, as a relative of it, T. euphorbiae, has been approved for use against invasive Euphorbia in the United States. History As the plant is popular in Persian cultural traditions, and is a hallucinogen, the linguists David Flattery and Martin Schwartz wrote a book in 1989 in which they theorised that the plant is the Avestan haoma mentioned in ancient Persian Zoroastrian texts. The transcribed word haoma is thought to be likely related to the Vedic word soma; these names refer to a magical, purportedly entheogenic plant/drink that is mentioned in ancient Indo-Iranian texts but whose exact identity has been lost to history.Karel van der Torn, ed., \\"Haoma,\\" Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible. (New York: E.J. Brill, 1995), 730. This plant was first described in a recognisable manner by Dioscorides under the name πήγανον ἄγριον (péganon agrion), who mentions it is called μῶλυ (moly) in parts of Anatolia (although Dioscorides distinguishes the 'real' μῶλυ as another, bulbaceous plant). Galen later describes the plant under the name μῶλυ, following Dioscorides by mentioning numerous other names it was known by: ἅρμολαν, armolan (harmala), πήγανον ἄγριον and in Syria βησασὰν, besasan (besasa). For much of the subsequent history of Europe Galen was seen as the pinnacle of human medical knowledge, whereas Dioscorides' works were largely lost. As such the herb was known during the early Middle Ages as moly or herba immolum. The 12th century Arab agriculturist Ibn al-'Awwam from Seville, Spain, wrote that the seeds were used in the baking of bread; the fumes being used to facilitate fermentation and help with the taste (he usually quotes older authors). By the mid-16th century Dodoens relates how apothecaries sold the plant under the name harmel as a type of extra-strength rue. Taxonomy Rembert Dodoens in 1554 illustrated and described the plant (republished 1583 with better illustration), calling it Harmala, and basing his work on Galen and Dioscorides. In 1596 Gaspard Bauhin had his Phytopinax published in which he attempted to list all plants known in an ordered manner. He judges Ruta sylvestris Dioscorides to be a type of Hypericum. Later, in his Pinax Theatri Botanici of 1623 he attempts to sort the synonymy in all the previously published names by the great botanists from earlier in history. In this work he sorts Ruta into five species, distinguishing this plant from the others by its three-locular fruit, large white flowers and being only known as a wild plant (as opposed to cultivated). He considers Peganum harmala to be (not all writers named in the following): Tabernaemontanus, Dodoens and Clusius' Harmala; Matthias de l'Obel's Harmala syriaca; Andreas Cæsalpinus and Conrad Gesner's (in his report on Ottoman plants) Harmel; Pietro Andrea Mattioli and Clusius' (in another work) Ruta sylvestris Harmala; Valerius Cordus (in his Annotations on Dioscorides), Gesner (in his Hortus), and William Turner's Ruta sylvestris; and Antonius Castor and Rudolf Jakob Camerarius' Ruta sylvestris secunda. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus named the species Peganum harmala. He cites this species based the works of Adriaan van Royen's Florae leydensis prodromus of 1740, Bauhin's Pinax Theatri Botanici of 1623, Rumphius's works, and the Stirpium Historiae Pemptades Sex by Rembert Dodoens (the 1616 edition). =Type= Species named by Linnaeus were not given type specimens at the time. The Flora Iberica has Mohammed Nabil El Hadidi designating a lectotype for P. harmala in 1993, stored at the British Museum of Natural History. The Tropicos website from the Missouri Botanical Garden has the lectotype designated by Vail & Rydberg in 1910, and has it as number 206, Peganum no. 1, at the George Clifford Herbarium. The Flora of Pakistan has the type as numbers 621.1 and 621.2 at the Linnaean Herbarium (LINN) in London. =Infraspecific variability= Peganum harmala var. garamantum – P. harmala var. garamantum was originally described by René Maire in 1953 in his Flore de l'Afrique du Nord. It was still recognised as occurring in Tunisia as of 2010 (along with var. typicum), although the distinction is not recognised in other works. Peganum harmala var. grandiflorum – El Hadidi described P. harmala var. grandiflorum in 1972 for the Flora Iranica based on herbarium material collected by H. Bobek in Tal Shahdad in Kerman Province, Iran in 1956, and said the variety grew in both Iran and Afghanistan. It was subsequently collected only once more, at least as recorded in the GBIF, in 1980 in Spain near the bank of the Ebro river approximately halfway downriver to the sea from Zaragosa. It is not mentioned in the Flora Iberica. Peganum harmala var. multisecta - First described by Karl Maximovich in 1889 from Qinghai. Sometimes incorrectly spelled var. multisectum. Occurs in Dzungaria, Hexi, Qaidam Basin, Ordos and the Altai regions in China and Mongolia. In China it occurs in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, northern Shanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Tibet (the Flora of China claims it is endemic to China). It can be distinguished by having the sepals (called 'calyx leaves' in one study) incised with 3–5 lobes, instead of being entire as in the nominate form (P. nigellastrum, which also occurs in the region, has this characteristic even more pronounced, but with the calyx leaves split into 5–7 thin string-like lobes), and by having leaves which are more dissected or may be trisected. The leaves are dissected to 3–5 lobes in the nominate form -the individual leaf lobes being 1.5-3mm wide, whereas this variety always has more than 5 lobes 1–1.5mm wide. The nominate form has seeds with a depressed surface, whereas var. multisecta has seeds with convex surface. Furthermore, the stems of this variety sprawl prostrate upon the ground, whereas the nominate has erect stems, and the variety has stems which are pubescent when young as opposed to always glabrous. Some consider it better to classify it as an independent species, P. multisectum (fide Bobrov, 1949). Others consider it a synonym of the nominate form. Peganum harmala var. rothschildianum – Originally described by cactus specialist Franz Buxbaum in 1927 as P. rothschildianum from northern Africa. Subsumed as a variety by René Maire in 1953. Not recognised for Tunisia, nor elsewhere. Peganum harmala var. stenophyllum – This variety is still accepted by some authorities, although it is not recognised in the Flora of Pakistan. Pierre Edmond Boissier described it in 1867 and it has been recognised as growing in Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Tajikistan, and the northern Caucasus. In India it is found in Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka. It can be distinguished from the nominate form by having finer leaves with more narrow lobes, shorter sepals and broader-shaped seed capsules. Toxicity Legal Issues In the United States it is considered an invasive, noxious weed in the following states: Arizona (prohibited noxious weed), California (A listed noxious weed), Colorado (A listed noxious weed), Nevada (noxious weed), New Mexico (class B noxious weed), and Oregon (A designated weed, under quarantine). This may require land owners to exterminate infestations on their land or be fined, and allows access to government grants to buy herbicides to do so. It is illegal to sell plants of this species in the states listed above. Since 2005, with caveats, the cultivation, possession or sale of this species is also illegal in Louisiana. Since 2005 the possession of the seeds, the plant itself, and the alkaloids harmine and harmaline which it contains is illegal in France. In Finland the plant is officially listed as a medicinal plant, which means one would require a doctors prescription to acquire it. In Canada harmaline is illegal. In Australia harmala alkaloids are illegal. Uses Peganum harmala seeds as sold in Iran and Middle Eastern foods grocery store =Weed and livestock poisoning= In some regions it is a common weed. In China it is seen as a noxious weed, invasive in overgrazed areas. In the United States, where it is not native, it is officially registered as a noxious weed or similar designation in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon. Infestations can be invasive and very difficult to exterminate. It is also known as an agricultural seed contaminant. It often causes livestock poisonings, especially during drought. Consumption by animals causes reduced fertility and abortions. Control is possible only with powerful herbicides. Manually uprooting the plants is near impossible and there are no methods of biological control currently awaiting approval. The rootstock contains starches that help the plant survive being defoliated and is thick and grows very deep, and the crown of the plant is safe below the surface. =Dyes= A red dye, \\"Turkey red\\", from the seeds (but usually obtained from madder) is often used in western Asia to dye carpets. It is also used to dye wool. When the seeds are extracted with water, a yellow fluorescent dye is obtained. If they are extracted with alcohol, a red dye is obtained. The stems, roots and seeds can be used to make inks, stains and tattoos. According to one source, for a time the traditional Ottoman fez was dyed with the extract from this plant. =Traditional medicine and superstitions= In Turkey, dried capsules from the plant are strung and hung in homes or vehicles to protect against \\"the evil eye\\". It is widely used for protection against Djinn in Morocco (see Légey \\"Essai de Folklore marocain\\", 1926). Burning esfand seeds is also common in Persian cultures for warding off the evil eye, as in Persian weddings. Syrian rue In Yemen, the Jewish custom of old was to bleach wheaten flour on Passover, in order to produce a clean and white unleavened bread. This was done by spreading whole wheat kernels upon a floor, and then spreading stratified layers of African rue (Peganum harmala) leaves upon the wheat kernels; a layer of wheat followed by a layer of Wild rue, which process was repeated until all wheat had been covered over with the astringent leaves of this plant. The wheat was left in this state for a few days, until the outer kernels of the wheat were bleached by the astringent vapors emitted by the Wild rue. Afterwards, the wheat was taken up and sifted, to rid them of the residue of leaves. They were then ground into flour, which left a clean and white batch of flour.Yiḥyah Salaḥ, Questions & Responsa Pe'ulath Ṣadiq, vol. I, responsum # 171, Jerusalem 1979; ibid., vol. III, responsum # 13 (Hebrew) Peganum harmala seeds heated over a gas flame as incense Peganum harmala has been used as an analgesic, emmenagogue, and abortifacient agent. In a certain region of India the root was applied to kill body lice. It is also used as an anthelmintic (to expel parasitic worms). Reportedly, the ancient Greeks used the powdered seeds to get rid of tapeworms and to treat recurring fevers (possibly malaria). As related in Des Cruydboeks of 1554 by Rembert Dodoens, in Europe this plant was considered to be a wild type of rue and identical in medicinal uses -the identity of the two plants and their Ancient Greek and Roman uses had merged, though it was considered stronger, even dangerously so. It could be bought under the name harmel in the apothecaries, and was also known as 'wild' or 'mountain' rue. It could be used for a few dozen ailments, such as to treat woman of their natural disease when the leaves were used in only water, or when the juice were drunk with wine and the leaves pressed against the wound it could cure bites and stings from rabid dogs, scorpions, bees and wasps and the like. From supposedly Pliny he relates how those covered in the sap, or having eaten it sober, would be immune to poison for a day, as well as to poisonous beasts. Other cures were for 'drying' sperm, 'purifying' woman after childbirth, curing earache, getting rid of spots and blemishes on the skin, and soothing bumps and pain caused by hitting a something, among many others. All the cures call for either juice or the leaves, none call for the seeds. =Entheogenic use= Peganum harmala seeds have been used as an ayahuasca analog (clarification needed), as they contain some of the same alkaloids as Banisteriopsis caapi. Alkaloids Some alkaloids of harmal seeds are monoamine oxidase A inhibitors (MAOIs): * Harmala alkaloids – Total harmala alkaloids were at least 5.9% of dried weight, in one study. ** Harmaline, 0.25%–0.79%–5.6% ** Harmalol, 0.6%–3.90% ** Harmane, 0.16% ** Harmine, 0.44%–1.84%–4.3% – The coatings of the seeds are said to contain large amounts of harmine. ** Tetrahydroharmine, 0.1% * Vasicine (peganine), 0.25% * Vasicinone, 0.0007% References Category:Anthelmintics Category:Antidepressants Category:Entheogens Category:Herbal and fungal hallucinogens Category:Medicinal plants of Asia Category:Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Category:Plant toxin insecticides Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers Category:Nitrariaceae Category:Oneirogens Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Ayahuasca analogs ","title":"Peganum harmala"},{"id":"913850","text":"The Report of the National Commission on Terrorism, also known as the Bremer Commission, \\"Countering The Changing Threat of International Terrorism\\", Pursuant to Public Law 277, 105th Congress, was published June 2000. Ambassador Paul Bremer served as Chairman, and Maurice Sonnenberg served as Vice Chairman. Conclusions * International terrorism poses an increasingly dangerous and difficult threat to America. * Countering the growing danger of the terrorist threat requires significantly stepping up U.S. efforts. * Priority one is to prevent terrorist attacks. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities must use the full scope of their authority to collect intelligence regarding terrorist plans and methods. * U.S. policies must firmly target all states that support terrorists. * Private sources of financial and logistical support for terrorists must be subjected to the full force and sweep of U.S. and international laws. * A terrorist attack involving a biological agent, deadly chemicals, or nuclear or radiological material, even if it succeeds only partially, could profoundly affect the entire nation. The government must do more to prepare for such an event. * The President and Congress should reform the system for reviewing and funding departmental counterterrorism programs to ensure that the activities and programs of various agencies are part of a comprehensive plan. The most controversial conclusions included the Report's call \\"for the monitoring of all foreign students, using criminals and terrorists as American spies, and making wiretapping easier\\" (Lodal, 2001, p. 100). The report clearly names state sponsors of terrorism including Iran and Syria. It specifically says this about Iran's involvement: The Department of State's 1999 \\"Patterns of Global Terrorism\\" provides the following account of Iranian support for terrorism: * Iran's security forces conducted several bombings against Iranian dissidents abroad. * Iran has increasingly encouraged and supported—with money, training, and weapons—terrorist groups such as Hizballah, HAMAS, the PIJ, and Ahmed Jibril's PFLP-GC. * Iran continues to provide a safehaven to elements of PKK, a Kurdish militant group that has conducted numerous attacks in Turkey and against Turkish targets in Europe. * Iran also provides support to terrorist groups in North Africa and South and Central Asia, including financial assistance and training. It recommends name Afghanistan, under the Taliban, as a state sponsor: \\"Recommendation: * The Secretary of State should designate Afghanistan as a sponsor of terrorism and impose all the sanctions that apply to state sponsors. \\" Commissioners (See Appendix C of the Report) *Paul Bremer, Chairman; Managing Director of Kissinger Associates *Maurice Sonnenberg, Vice Chairman *Richard K.

Chronological and genealogical position Traditionally his career was placed before that of the High Priest of Amun, Piankh, since it was believed that the latter was his son. However, this filiation was based on an incorrect reconstruction by Karl Richard Lepsius of a scene in the Temple of Khonsu. It is now believed that the partly preserved name of the son of Herihor depicted there was not [Pi]Ankh, but rather Ankh[ef(enmut)].The Epigraphic Survey, The Temple of Khonsu, Vol. I, (OIP 100), preface, x-xii Since then, Karl Jansen-Winkeln has argued that Piankh preceded rather than succeeded Herihor as High Priest at Thebes and that Herihor outlived Ramesses XI before being succeeded in this office by Pinedjem I, Piankh's son.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"Das Ende des Neuen Reiches\\", Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache , 119 (1992), pp.22-37 online If Jansen-Winkeln is correct, Herihor would have served in office as High Priest, after succeeding Piankh, for longer than just 6 years, as is traditionally believed. The following paragraphs contain several statements based on the traditional order (Herihor before Piankh) and therefore give only one possible reconstruction. Life While his origins are unknown, it is thought that his parents were Libyans.Ian Shaw & Paul Nicholson, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt (British Museum Press, 1995), p. 124 Jansen-Winkeln's recent publication in Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache suggests that Piankh – originally thought to be Herihor's successor – was actually Herihor's predecessor.Karl Jansen-Winkeln, \\"Das Ende des Neuen Reiches\\", Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache, 119 (1992), pp. 22-37 Herihor advanced through the ranks of the military during the reign of Ramesses XI. His wife Nodjmet, may have been Ramesses XI's daughter—and perhaps even Piankh's wife if Piankh was his predecessor as Jansen-Winkeln today hypothesizes.Jansen-Winkeln, pp. 22-37 At the decoration of the hypostyle hall walls of the temple of Khonsu at Karnak, Herihor served several years under king Ramesses XI since he is shown obediently performing his duties as chief priest under this sovereign.Arno Egberts, \\"Hard Times: The Chronology of \\"The Report of Wenamun\\" Revised\\", Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache, 125 (1998), p. 96 But he assumed more and more titles, from high priest to vizier, before finally openly taking the royal title at Thebes, even if he still nominally recognised the authority of Ramesses XI, the actual king of Egypt. It is disputed today whether or not this 'royal phase' of Herihor's career began during or after Ramesses XI's lifetime. Herihor never really held power outside the environs of Thebes, and Ramesses XI may have outlived him by two years although Jansen-Winkeln argues that Ramesses XI actually died first and only then did Herihor finally assume some form of royal status at Thebes and openly adopted royal titles—but only in a \\"half-hearted\\" manner according to Arno Egberts who has adopted Jansen- Winkeln's views here.Egberts, p. 97 Herihor's usurpation of royal privileges is observed \\"in the decoration of the court of the Khonsu temple\\" but his royal datelines \\"betray nothing of the royal status he enjoyed according to the contemporary scenes and inscriptions of the court of the Khonsu temple.\\" While both Herihor and his wife Nodjmet were given royal cartouches in inscriptions on their funerary equipment, their 'kingship' was limited to a few relatively restricted areas of Thebes whereas Ramesses XI's name was still recorded in official administrative documents throughout the country.Shaw & Nicholson, p. 125 During the Wehem Mesut era, the Theban high priest—Herihor—and Ramesses XI quietly agreed to accept the new political situation where the High Priest was unofficially as powerful as Pharaoh. The report of Wenamun (also known as Wen-Amon) was made in Year 5 of Herihor and Herihor is mentioned in several Year 5 and Year 6 mummy linen graffitos. The de facto split between Ramesses XI and his 21st Dynasty successors with the High Priests of Amun at Thebes (referred to in Ancient Egyptian as Wehem Mesut or 'Renaissance') resulted in the unofficial political division of Egypt between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, with the kings ruling Lower Egypt from Tanis. This division did not come to a complete end until the accession of the Libyan Dynasty 22 king Shoshenq I in 943 BC. Shoshenq was able to appoint his son Iuput to be the new High Priest of Amun at Thebes, thus exercising authority over all of ancient Egypt. Herihor and the Nodjmet problem It is beyond doubt that Herihor had a wife called Nodjmet. She has been attested in the Temple of Khonsu where she is depicted at the head of a procession of children of Herihor, and on Stela Leiden V 65, where she is depicted with Herihor, presented as High Priest without royal overtones, so apparently dating from quite early in his career. Mummy of Nodjmet, wife (or mother?) of Herihor Normally, she is identified with the mummy of a Nodjmet which was discovered in the Deir el-Bahari cache (TT320). With this mummy two Books of the Dead were found.Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650 BC), 2nd ed. (Warminster: Aris & Phillips Limited, 1986), pp. 42-45 One of these, Papyrus BM 10490, now in the British museum, belonged to \\"the King’s Mother Nodjmet, the daughter of the King’s Mother Hrere\\". Whereas the name of Nodjmet was written in a cartouche, the name of Hrere was not. Since mostly this Nodjmet is seen as the wife of the High Priest Herihor, Herere’s title is often interpreted as \\"King’s Mother-in-law\\",Kitchen, p. 44 although her title \\"who bore the Strong Bull\\" suggests that she actually must have given birth to a king.Wente, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 26 (1967), pp. 173-174 However, recently, the common opinion that there was only one Queen Nodjmet has been challenged and the old view that the mummy found in the Royal Cache was that of the mother of Herihor rather than his wife has been revived.Ad Thijs, \\"Two Books for One Lady, The mother of Herihor rediscovered\\", Göttinger Miszellen, 163 (1998), 101-110Ad Thijs, \\"Nodjmet A, Daughter of Amenhotep, Wife of Piankh and Mother of Herihor\\", Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde 140 (2013), 54-69. Although it is beyond dispute that Herihor had a queen called Nodjmet (this was already recognised by Champollion), as far back as 1878 Édouard Naville postulated that Herihor must have had a mother called Nodjmet. He did so on the basis of Papyrus BM 10541, the other Book of the Dead found with her mummy. As A. Thijs has recently pointed out, it is indeed remarkable that, although Herihor figures in P. BM 10541, Nodjmet nowhere in her two Books of the Dead is designated as \\"King’s Wife\\". All the stress is on her position as \\"King’s Mother\\". This is true for all the sources found in the Royal Cache. The ruling family from the transitional period from the 20th to the 21st dynasty is notorious for the repetitiveness of names, so Herihor having a homonymous wife and mother would in itself not be impossible or even remarkable. If the Nodjmet from the Royal Cache was indeed the mother of Herihor, it follows that Hrere must have been the grandmother of Herihor rather than his mother(-in-law). In this position Hrere could well have been the wife of the High Priest Amenhotep. It has been proposed to refer to the Nodjmet found in the Royal Cache as \\"Nodjmet A\\" (=the mother of Herihor) and to the wife of Herihor as \\"Nodjmet B\\". Ethiopian tradition Traditional Ethiopian kinglists name Herihor, and his successors through Pinudjem II, among the rulers of Saba in the Semitic Agazyan Ethiopian dynasty,C.F. Rey, In the Country of the Blue Nile, 1927 and he is considered to have ruled Ethiopia for 16 years in addition to being de facto ruler in Egypt. According to Ethiopian historian Tekletsadiq Mekuria, Herihor's father was the former High Priest Amenhotep, and his mother was a daughter of Ramesses IV.Tekletsadiq Mekuria, History of Nubia, 1959.

According to the foundation's website, its mission is \\"to contribute to important public debates and to address serious public policy challenges facing the United States. The Foundation seeks to help ensure the vitality of our social, economic, and governmental institutions. It also seeks to assist with the development of effective policies to compete internationally and to advance U.S. interests and values abroad.\\" History The Smith Richardson Foundation was established in 1935 by H. Smith Richardson, Sr., and his wife Grace Jones Richardson. Richardson transformed the Vicks Chemical Company, a firm created by his father, Lunsford Richardson, into one of the leading over-the-counter drug companies in the world. In later years, Richardson-Vicks also became a major force in the market for prescription drugs as well as a wide range of consumer products. In 1985, the Richardson family sold the company to Procter & Gamble. In 1973, R. Randolph Richardson assumed the presidency of the Foundation. Richardson was particularly interested in supporting free-market and pro-democratic causes. During his tenure as president, the Foundation played an important role in supporting think tanks and scholars who were active in public policy debates over issues such as defense policy, tax policy, education reform, and regulation. The Foundation also supported pro-democracy organizations in Central and Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and Central and South America. In 1992, Peter L. Richardson, a nephew of R. Randolph Richardson, assumed the presidency of the Foundation, while Heather Higgins, the daughter of R. Randolph Richardson, became president of the Randolph Foundation. Current programs The Foundation advances its mission through its two principal grant making programs: the International Security and Foreign Policy Program and the Domestic Public Policy Program. The Foundation believes that conflict and change in the international environment have created new needs in the U.S. policy community for analysis and guidance on critical foreign and defense policy issues. In the domestic arena, the Foundation believes that policy makers are seeking innovative and pragmatic solutions to the long-term challenges affecting the well being of all Americans. A 2013 Smithsonian Magazine article listed the Foundation as among the largest contributors to the climate change denial movement from 2003 to 2010. =International Security and Foreign Policy Program= According to the foundation's website: \\"The objective of the International Security and Foreign Policy Program is to assist the U.S. policy community in developing effective national security strategies and foreign policies. The Foundation is committed to supporting projects that help the policy community face the fundamental challenge of ensuring the security of the United States, protecting and promoting American interests and values abroad, and enhancing international order.\\" The International Security and Foreign Policy Program has a number of priority areas of interest. The ongoing instability in key regions and states highlights the need to improve U.S. capabilities in the areas of intelligence gathering and analysis, public diplomacy, counterinsurgency, and post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction. The international program has long sought to support projects designed to improve the effectiveness of U.S. military forces through defense transformation. Geopolitical competition, the uncertain future of economic and political developments in key states such as Russia, and the increasingly important roles that China and India play in international politics require renewed assessments of how best to deploy U.S. resources in order to achieve strategic objectives around the globe. The Foundation also seeks to support projects on key transnational issues such as proliferation, terrorism, democratization, and global political change. Within the academic community, the international program supports policy-relevant strategic studies and underwrites historical research with implications or lessons for current policy. =Domestic Public Policy Program= The Domestic Public Policy Program supports projects that will help the public and policy makers understand and address critical challenges facing the United States. To that end, the Foundation supports research on and evaluation of existing public policies and programs, as well as projects that inject new ideas into public debates. The Foundation is interested in a wide range of topics. The Foundation has supported work designed to strengthen the foundations of U.S. economic growth by examining critical issues in monetary, fiscal, and tax policy. The Foundation has sought to identify strategies to lift the performance of U.S. schools through its support of work on incentive programs for students and performance pay for teachers. The Foundation has also embarked on an effort to develop strategies to improve the performance of public agencies through the effective use of government-led networks and the strengthening of the capacity of the public-sector workforce. The Foundation continues to provide support for projects that examine the effectiveness of our regulatory policies, explore the interaction between the policy making and the political processes, and evaluate the effectiveness of policies designed to assist disadvantaged families. Assets and grant making At the end of 2013, the foundation had assets totaling $521,570,780 according to its federal tax return. During that year, it awarded a total of 411 grants totaling $20,695,903 . SRF has awarded grants to major think tanks and university research centers.

The operation was launched based on intelligence provided by Major general Nguyen Chanh Thi, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) I Corps commander. III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) commander Lieutenant General Lewis W. Walt devised a plan to launch a pre-emptive strike against the Viet Cong (VC) 1st Regiment to nullify their threat to the vital Chu Lai Air Base and Base Area and ensure its powerful communication tower remained intact. The operation was conducted as a combined arms assault involving ground, air and naval units. U.S. Marines were deployed by helicopter insertion while an amphibious landing was used to deploy other Marines. The VC used a variety of tactics to counter the Marine assault, fighting from prepared positions and then withdrawing as the Marines gained local superiority and ambushing a lost supply column. The VC were unable to withstand the weight of the Marine assault and U.S. firepower losing 614 killed and nine captured for U.S. losses of 42 killed. Background The United States had been providing material support to South Vietnam since its foundation in 1954. The Vietnam War effectively began with the start of the North Vietnamese backed VC insurgency in 1959/60 and the U.S. increased its military aid and advisory support to South Vietnam in response. With the worsening military and political situation in South Vietnam, the U.S. increasingly became directly involved in the conflict. U.S. Marines were the first ground troops deployed to South Vietnam, landing at Da Nang on 8 March 1965. In May the Marines and ARVN forces secured the Chu Lai area to establish a jet-capable airfield and base area. On 30 July, COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland told III MAF commander General Walt that he expected him to undertake larger offensive operations with the South Vietnamese against the VC at greater distances from his base areas. Walt reminded Westmoreland that the Marines were still bound by the 6 May Letter of Instruction that restricted III MAF to reserve/reaction missions in support of South Vietnamese units heavily engaged with a VC force. Westmoreland replied \\"these restraints were no longer realistic, and invited Walt to rewrite the instructions, working into them the authority he thought he needed, and promised his approval.\\" On 6 August, General Walt received official permission to take the offensive against the VC. With the arrival of the 7th Marine Regiment a week later, he prepared to move against the 1st VC Regiment. In early July, the 1st VC Regiment had launched a second attack against the hamlet of Ba Gia, south of Chu Lai. The ARVN garrison was overrun, causing 130 casualties and the loss of more than 200 weapons, including two 105 mm howitzers. After the attack on Ba Gia, US intelligence agencies located the 1st VC Regiment in the mountains west of the hamlet. Reports indicated that the regiment was once more on the march. Acting on this intelligence, the 4th Marine Regiment conducted a one- battalion operation with the ARVN 51st Regiment, 1st Division in search of the 1st VC Regiment south of the Trà Bồng River. Codenamed Thunderbolt, the operation lasted from 6 to 7 August, and extended 7km south of the river in an area west of Route 1. The ARVN and Marines found little sign of any major VC force in the area and encountered only scattered resistance. Eight days after Thunderbolt, the Allies finally confirmed the location of the 1st VC Regiment. On 15 August, a deserter from the regiment surrendered to the ARVN. During his interrogation at General Thi's headquarters he revealed that the regiment had established its base in the Van Tuong village complex on the coast, south of Chu Lai and planned to attack Chu Lai. The prisoner told his interrogators that the 1st VC Regiment at Van Tuong consisted of two of its three battalions, the 60th and 80th, reinforced by the 52nd Company and a company from the 45th Weapons Battalion; approximately 1,500 men in all. Thi, who personally questioned the prisoner and believed the man was telling the truth, relayed the information to Walt. At about the same time, the III MAF intelligence section received corroborative information from another source. Convinced of the danger to the airfield, Walt's subordinates advised a spoiling attack in the Van Tuong region. Walt flew to Chu Lai and held a hurried council of war with his senior commanders there: Brigadier general Frederick J. Karch, who had become the Chu Lai Coordinator on 5 August, Colonel McClanahan of the 4th Marines and Colonel Oscar F. Peatross, the newly arrived 7th Marines' commander. Walt then decided to proceed with an operation. Planning In a hectic two-day period, the III MAF, division, wing and 7th Marines staffs assembled forces and prepared plans for the attack. The concept for the operation dictated a two-battalion assault, one battalion to land across the beach and the other to land by helicopter further inland. The division reassigned two battalions previously under the operational control of the 4th Marines to Peatross as the assault battalions, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph R. Fisher's 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph E. Muir's 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. Walt, who wanted a third battalion as a floating reserve, requested permission to use the Shore Landing Force (SLF) which Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. approved immediately. At the time of the request the amphibious task force was located at Subic Bay Naval Base, away. Based upon its transit time to the operational area, the planners selected 18 August as D-Day. The operation was originally called Satellite, but a power blackout led to a clerk working by candlelight typing \\"Starlite\\" instead. In order to maintain the secrecy of the operation, none of the ARVN Joint General Staff were informed about the operation until after it had started. Only Generals Thi and ARVN 2nd Division commander General Hoàng Xuân Lãm had advance knowledge of the operation in order to keep ARVN forces out of the operational area. Peatross and his commanders conducted an aerial surveillance of the area and selected the amphibious assault landing site, as well as the helicopter landing zones (LZs). They chose the beach north of the coastal hamlet of An Cuong, later designated Green Beach, for the landing. A force there would block VC avenues of escape to the south. Three LZs, Red, White and Blue, were selected east of Route 1 and roughly inland from the coast. LZ Blue, about 2km west of Green Beach, was the southernmost of the LZs. White was 2km west northwest of Blue, while Red was 2km north of White. From these positions, the Marines were to move northeast to the South China Sea. On the morning of the 17th the plans were completed. 3/3 Marines was to land across Green Beach at 06:30, 18 August with Companies I and K abreast, K on the right. Company L, the battalion reserve, was to follow as the lead companies swerved to the northwest. The remaining company, Company M, was to make an overland movement from Chu Lai to a ridgeline blocking position in the northern portion of the operations area, northwest of Green Beach and inland from the sea, closing off the VCs' retreat. Soon after H-Hour, UH-34s from HMM-261 and HMM-361 were to shuttle the 2/4th Marines into the three LZs. The two battalions were to join forces when Company H from LZ Blue linked up with Company I outside the hamlet of An Cuong , 1.8km inland from Green Beach. From there, the Marines were to sweep to the sea through the Van Tuong village complex and over the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. Artillery batteries at Chu Lai were to provide artillery support while two United States Navy destroyers, the and the and the cruiser were available for naval gunfire support. Aircraft from Marine Aircraft Group 11 and Marine Aircraft Group 12 were to fly close support for the operation. Battle Operation Starlite 18-19 August 1965 At 10:00 on the 17th, Company M, 3/3 Marines boarded LVTP-5s at Chu Lai and moved along the coast to the Trung Phan Peninsula; then the company marched south where it established its blocking position. The Marines of Company M met only minor resistance, an occasional sniper and booby traps. Before dawn on the 18th, the company reached its objective and dug in. Marine patrols had been active in this area for some time and to the casual observer the company's activity was just another small unit movement. At 17:00 on 17 August, the rest of 3/3rd Marines, with Colonel Peatross and his staff, embarked on the three ships of the amphibious task group, , and . Three M67 Flame Thrower Tanks attached to the 7th Marines and a platoon of five M48 tanks assigned to Fisher's battalion boarded two LCUs, which then sailed independently towards the amphibious objective area, timing their arrival to coincide with that of the troop transports. The task force first sailed east to deceive any VC in sampans in the coastal waters. Once over the horizon, the ships changed course to the southwest, arriving in the amphibious objective area shortly after 05:00. There they were joined by the Galveston and the Orleck, which were to cover the landing. At 06:15, 15 minutes before H-Hour, Battery K, 4th Battalion, 12th Marines, which had displaced to firing positions on the northern bank of the Trà Bồng River the night before, began 155 mm preparation fires of the helicopter landing zones. The artillery was soon reinforced by 20 Marine A-4s and F-4s which dropped 18 tons of bombs and napalm on the LZs. The Marines limited their preparation of Green Beach to 20mm cannon strafing runs by MAG-12 A-4s, because of the proximity of An Cuong to the landing site. As the air and artillery fires lifted, the ground forces arrived, Companies I and K, in LVTP-5s, landed across Green Beach at 06:30 and pushed inland according to plan. The troops quickly spread out and moved into An Cuong. After a futile search for VC, the company continued advancing to the west. Company K received sniper fire from its right as it crossed the northern portion of Green Beach. Two platoons quickly moved northward and the VC fire ceased. The third platoon secured the northern half of An Cuong. Fifteen minutes after H-Hour, Company G, 2/4th Marines landed at LZ Red. Company F and the command group landed at LZ White and Company H arrived at LZ Blue 45 minutes later. On the beach, Muir, who had moved his command post ashore, was joined at 07:30 by Peatross and his staff. Tanks and M50 Ontos rolled off the LCUs and landing craft mechanized (LCMs) and made their way forward to support the assault companies. Company L came ashore and established perimeter security for the supply area at the beach. Most of the Marine companies met only light resistance as they moved into the attack. Company G searched two hamlets in the vicinity of LZ Red and then advanced to the northeast and linked up with Company M without incident. At LZ White Company E encountered stiffer opposition from the VC. The VC manned firing positions on a ridgeline east and northeast of the LZ, employing mortars, machine guns, and small arms. After dogged fighting, the Marines cleared the hills. By midmorning, Company E began moving northeast. At one juncture, the Marines spotted about 100 VC in the open and asked for artillery fire. The 107mm Mortar (Howtar) Battery, 3rd Battalion, 12th Marines, helilifted into the position held by Company M, shelled the VC force killing an estimated 90 VC. Company E continued to push forward, finding only occasional opposition. Along the coast, Company K had advanced to Phase Line Banana, 2km north of Green Beach. There a VC force, entrenched on a hill overlooking the Marine positions, blocked the advance of the company. Muir, who had established his forward command post with Company K, ordered Company L forward. By midafternoon, the two Marine companies, aided by supporting arms, captured the high ground and set up night defenses. The major action developed in the south near LZ Blue, at the junction of 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines. This area, roughly one square kilometer, was bound by the hamlets of An Thoi on the north, Nam Yen on the south and An Cuong to the east. It was a patchwork of rice paddies, streams, hedgerows, woods and built-up areas, interspersed by trails leading in all directions. Two small knolls dominated the flat terrain, Hill 43, a few hundred meters southwest of Nam Yen, and Hill 30, 400 meters north of An Cuong. LZ Blue was just south of Nam Yen, between Hill 43 and the hamlet. Company H's LZ was almost on top of the VC 60th Battalion. The VC allowed the first helicopters to touch down with little interference, but then opened fire as the others came in. Three U.S. Army UH-1B gunships from the 7th Airlift Platoon, took the VC on Hill 43 under fire while Company H formed a defensive perimeter around the LZ. The Company H commander, First Lieutenant Homer K. Jenkins, was not yet aware of the size of the VC force. He ordered one platoon to take the hill and the rest of the company to secure Nam Yen, both attacks soon stalled. The platoon attacking Hill 43 was still at the bottom of the hill when Jenkins called back his other two platoons from the outskirts of Nam Yen in order to regroup. He requested air strikes against both the VC hill position and Nam Yen and then renewed the attack, but this time, Jenkins moved all three of his platoons into the assault on the hill. The VC fought tenaciously, but the Marines, reinforced by close air support and tanks, were too strong. One Marine platoon counted six dead VC near a heavy machine gun position and more bodies scattered throughout the brush. Jenkins' men took one prisoner and collected over 40 weapons. The airstrikes called by Jenkins against VC positions at Nam Yen momentarily halted the advance of Company I, 3/3rd Marines at a streambed east of Nam Yen. Bomb fragments slightly wounded two Marines. After the bombing run, Company I moved north along the stream for 500 meters to a point opposite An Cuong. Under fire from An Cuong, An Thoi and Nam Yen, Captain Bruce D. Webb, the company commander, requested permission to attack An Cuong, although it was across the bank in the area of responsibility of the 2/4th Marines. Muir approved the request, after consulting with Peatross. An Cuong was a fortified hamlet, ideally suited to VC combat tactics. The area surrounding the hamlet was heavily wooded with severely restricted fields of fire. The only open areas were the rice paddies and even these were interspersed with hedgerows of hardwood and bamboo thickets. An Cuong itself consisted of 25-30 huts, with fighting holes and camouflaged trench lines connected by a system of interlocking tunnels. As the company cleared the first few huts, a grenade exploded, killing Webb and wounding three other Marines. No sooner had the grenade exploded, than two 60mm mortar rounds fell on the advancing troops, inflicting three more casualties. First Lieutenant Richard M. Purnell, the company executive officer, assumed command and committed the reserve platoon. The company gained the upper hand and the action slackened as the troops secured the hamlet. Making a hurried survey of the battlefield, Purnell counted 50 VC bodies. He then radioed his battalion commander for further instructions. Muir ordered Purnell's company to join Company K, which was heavily engaged at Phase Line Banana, 2km to the northeast. Company H remained near Nam Yen to clean out all VC opposition there and then planned to link up with Muir's battalion. While Company I maneuvered through An Cuong Peatross committed one company of his reserve battalion to the battle. Company I, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines on were landed by HMM-163 helicopters shortly after 09:30. As Company I was preparing to move from An Cuong, a UH-1E gunship from VMO-2 was shot down by VC small arms fire northeast of the hamlet. Muir ordered Purnell to leave some men behind to protect the helicopter. Purnell ordered two squads and three tanks to stay with the helicopter until the craft was evacuated. As the company departed, its members could see that Jenkins' Company H had left Hill 43 and was advancing on the left flank of Company I. At 11:00 Jenkins led his unit, augmented by five tanks and three Ontos, from the Hill 43 area into the open rice paddy between Nam Yen and An Cuong. Jenkins bypassed Nam Yen as he mistakenly believed that Company I had cleared both hamlets. Suddenly, from positions in Nam Yen and from Hill 30, the VC opened up with small arms and machine gun fire, catching the Marine rearguard in a crossfire. Then mortar shells began bursting upon the lead platoons. Company H was taking fire from all directions, and tracked vehicles, Ontos and tanks, were having trouble with the muck of the paddies. Jenkins drew his armor into a tight circle and deployed his infantry. One squad moved to the northwest of Nam Yen and killed nine VC who were manning a mortar, but were driven off by small arms fire and had to withdraw to the relative security of the tanks. Jenkins saw that his position was untenable, and after radioing for supporting arms, he ordered his force to withdraw to LZ Blue. Artillery hit Nam Yen while F-4s and A-4s attacked Hill 30. About 14:00, the company tried to move back to the LZ. The lead platoon was forced to alter course when medical evacuation helicopters tried to land in the midst of the unit. As it maneuvered off to the flank of Company H, this platoon became separated from Jenkins' main body and was engaged by the VC. At this juncture, the platoon unexpectedly linked up with Purnell's helicopter security detail which had started to move toward its parent company after the downed helicopter had been repaired and flown out. The small force was quickly engaged by a VC unit, but together the two Marine units fought their way to An Cuong. Meanwhile, Jenkins and his other two platoons fought a delaying action and withdrew to LZ Blue, arriving there at 16:30. Fisher directed Jenkins to establish a defensive perimeter and await reinforcements. A MAG-16 helicopter evacuates casualties, while a Marine M48 Patton tank stands guard The expected reinforcements never arrived; they had been diverted to help a supply column that had been ambushed 400m west of An Cuong. Just before noon, Muir had ordered his executive officer in charge of the 3/3rd Marines rear command group, Major Andrew G. Comer, to dispatch the mobile (LVT) resupply to Company I, which, at the time, was only a \\"few hundred yards\\" in front of the command group. Five LVTP-5s and three flame tanks, the only tactical support available at the time, were briefed on the location of the company and marked the routes they were to follow on their maps. The supply column left the command post (CP) shortly after noon, but got lost between Nam Yen and An Thoi. It had followed a trail that was flanked on one side by a rice paddy and on the other by trees and hedgerows. As the two lead vehicles, a tank and an LVTP, went around a bend in the road, an explosion occurred near the tank, followed by another in the middle of the column. Fire from VC recoilless rifles and a barrage of mortar rounds tore into the column. The vehicles backed off the road and turned their weapons to face the VC. Using all of their weapons the troops held off the closing VC infantry. The rear tank tried to use its flamethrower, but a VC shell had rendered it useless. Throughout the fighting, the convoy was still able to maintain communications with the command post, radioing that the column was surrounded by VC and was about to be overrun. The LVT radio operator kept the microphone button depressed the entire time and pleaded for help. The command post was unable to quiet him sufficiently to gain essential information as to their location. This continued for an extended period, perhaps an hour. Informed of the ambush Muir replied that he was returning Company I to the rear CP and ordered Comer to gather whatever other support they could and to rescue them as rapidly as possible. Peatross, well aware of the vulnerable positions of both Company H and the supply column and fearing that the VC was attempting to drive a salient between the two battalions approved a rescue mission. The plan was to use a rapidly moving tank, LVTP and Ontos column through the previously cleared An Cuong area. Before the planning meeting broke up, one of the flame tanks which had been in the supply column arrived at the CP, the crew chief, a staff sergeant, reported that they had just passed through An Cuong without being fired upon and that he could lead them to the supply column. Shortly after 13:00, Comer's force moved out. Just after cresting Hill 30, the M-48 tank was hit by recoilless rifle fire and stopped short. The other vehicles immediately jammed together and simultaneously mortar and small arms fire saturated the area. Within a few minutes, the Marines suffered five dead and 17 wounded. The infantry quickly dismounted and the Ontos maneuvered to provide frontal fire and to protect the flanks while artillery fire and air support was called in. With the response of supporting arms, the VC fire diminished and Company I was ordered to resume its advance toward An Cuong leaving a small rear guard on Hill 30 to supervise the evacuation of the casualties. The company entered An Cuong against little resistance, but Comer's command group were caught by intense fire from a wooded area to their right front and forced to take what cover they could in the open rice paddies. At the same time, the Marines came upon the two reinforced squads from Company I which had been left to guard the downed Huey and the platoon from Company H. The two squads from Company I fought their way to Hill 30 where they were evacuated while the Company H platoon remained in the rice paddies. As the intensity of the battle increased, Peatross ordered a halt to the advance of the units from LZs Red and White and along the coast to prevent the overextension of his lines. Company L, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 17:30 and was placed under the operational control of Muir, who ordered them to reinforce Company I in the search for the supply column. Supported by two tanks, Company L moved out. As they advanced through the open rice paddies east of An Cuong, they came under heavy fire, wounding 14 and killing four. The Marines persevered and the VC broke contact as night fell. The addition of a third Marine company to the area, coupled with the weight of supporting arms fire available, evidently forced the VC 60th Battalion to break contact. The Marines radioed the Galveston and Orleck requesting continuous illumination throughout the evening over the Nam Yen-An Cuong area. As darkness fell, Peatross informed Walt that the VC apparently intended to defend selected positions, while not concentrating their forces. Muir decided that it was too risky to continue searching for the supply column that night, especially after having learned that the column, although immobilized, was no longer in danger. Muir ordered Company L to move to Phase Line Banana and join Companies K and L, and establish a perimeter defense there. He also ordered Company I to return to the regimental CP. For all intents and purposes, the fighting was over for Company I; of its 177 men who had crossed the beach, 14 were dead, including the company commander, and another 53 were wounded, but the company claimed 125 VC killed. During the night of 18 August, Peatross brought the rest of the SLF battalion ashore. Company I, 3/7th Marines arrived at the regimental CP at 18:00, followed shortly by Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Bodley and his command group. Just after midnight, Company M landed across Green Beach from the . With the arrival of his third battalion, Peatross completed his plans for the next day. The concept of action remained basically the same, squeeze the vice around the VC and drive them toward the sea. As a result of the first day's action against the VC 60th Battalion, he readjusted the battalions' boundaries. At 07:30, Muir's 3/3rd Marines, with Companies K and L abreast and Company L, 3/7th Marines following in reserve, was to attack to the northeast from Phase Line Banana. Simultaneously, Fisher's 2/4th Marines, with Companies E and G, was to drive eastward to the sea, joining 3/3rd Marines. Jenkins' Company H, Comer's group, and Company I were to withdraw to the regimental CP. The remainder of 3/7th Marines was to fill the gap. Companies I and M were to move out of the regimental CP, extract the ambushed supply column, and then move toward An Thoi to establish a blocking position there which would prevent the VC from slipping southward. Company M, 3/3rd Marines was to hold its blocking positions further north. The VC were to be left no avenue of escape. On the 19th, 3/7th Marines moved into its zone of action which included the area of the fiercest fighting of the day before, but the VC were gone. At 09:00, Companies I and M left the regimental CP, and moved through An Cuong, meeting no VC resistance. They brought out the supply column and by 15:00 had established their assigned blocking position at An Thoi. Although much of the VC resistance had disappeared, Fisher and Muir still found pockets of stiff opposition when they launched their combined attacks at 07:30. The terrain was very difficult as the rice paddies, ringed by dikes and hedgerows, hindered control, observation and maneuverability. The VC were holed up in bunkers, trenches, and caves which were scattered throughout the area. Marines would sweep through an area, only to have VC snipers fire upon them from the rear. In many cases, the Marines had to dig out the VC or blow up the tunnels. By 10:30, Company E had linked up with Company K and the two battalions continued their advance to the sea. By nightfall, the 2/4th Marines had completed its sweep of the Phuoc Thuan Peninsula. VC organized resistance had ceased. Aftermath Although the cordon phase of Starlite had been completed, Walt decided to continue the operation for five more days so that the entire area could be searched systematically. He believed that some of the VC had remained behind in underground hiding places. 2/4th Marines and 3/3rd Marines returned to Chu Lai on the 20th and 1st Battalion, 7th Marines moved into the objective area and joined 3/7th Marines and units from the ARVN 2nd Division for the search. The Marines killed 54 more VC in the Van Tuong complex before Starlite came to an end on 24 August. The Marines had killed 614 VC by body count, taken nine prisoners, held 42 suspects and collected 109 assorted weapons, at a cost of 45 Marines dead and 203 wounded. Corporal Robert E. O'Malley (3/3 Marines) and Lance Corporal Joe C. Paul (2/4 Marines) received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the operation; Muir was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the operation. Purnell (3/3 Marines) received the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action.Richard Purnell, , \\"Military Times\\", August 18, 1965 To the Americans, the battle was considered a great success for U.S. forces as they had engaged a local force VC unit and come out victorious. The VC also claimed victory, announcing that they had inflicted 900 American casualties (killed and wounded), destroyed 22 tanks and APCs and downed 13 helicopters, while suffering 200-300 casualties before withdrawing.Nguyen Ngoc Toan, \\"Van Tuong victory raises confidence in defeating US troops\\", People's Army Newspaper, 21 December 2014. The ambush of the Marine supply column was reported by journalist Peter Arnett and proved an embarrassment to the Johnson administration, who wanted to retain the secrecy of the operation. The story of the ambush of the Marine supply column was denied by the USMC. Lessons learned from the battle included the knowledge that the daily allotment of of water per man was inadequate in the heat of Vietnam. References Further reading  * Summers, Harry G.

Known as \\"The Citrus Wizard\\", he is remembered for his contribution to the orange-growing industry in Florida. Life Born in Taishan, Guangdong, Qing dynasty China to a family of farmers, Lue Gim Gong was interested in the United States and the opportunities that lay across the Pacific Ocean. After his uncle returned from America when Lue was 12, the boy pleaded with his parents to let him return with his uncle to America. His parents agreed, giving him a bolt of silk to sell when he arrived. He lived in a heavily Chinese-populated area in San Francisco until the age 16 when he moved to North Adams, Massachusetts, to work at a shoe factory. At the factory, Lue met Fannie Burlingame, who taught his Sunday School class. When she learned of his skill with plants, she asked him to live with the Burlingames to tend their garden. She converted him to Christianity, and helped him become a United States citizen in 1877. Lue had been advised to move to a warmer climate due to his recent contraction of tuberculosis. Due to his conversion, he was unable to return to China. Fannie recommended a relocation to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned land. Lue agreed, and in 1885, he was working once again, this time in orange groves. He died in DeLand on July 3, 1925. Legacy * Lue had learned some pollination techniques from his mother in China, with which he was able to develop an apple which ripened a month earlier than other varieties, and a tomato plant that grew in clusters. In Florida, he learned to cross-pollinate citrus by watching bees. He developed a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop, and grapefruits which grew singularly, rather than in clumps, on the branch, as well as an aromatic variety. * Wooden Fish Songs, by Ruthanne Lum McCunn, is an historical novel based on Lue's life. * In 1888, Lue cross- pollinated the \\"Harts late\\" Valencia and \\"Mediterranean Sweet\\" orange varieties, which produced a fruit both sweet and frost-tolerant. Originally considered a hybrid, the \\"Lue Gim Gong\\" orange was later found to be a nucellar seedling of the \\"Valencia\\" variety,Purdue University archives which is properly called the \\"'Lue Gim Gong Strain\\". Distributed by Glen St. Mary Nurseries, the variety was awarded the Silver Wilder Medal by the American Pomological Society in 1911, the first such award for a citrus fruit.Morton, J. 1987.

Reign Ramesses V's reign was characterized by the continued growth of the power of the priesthood of Amun, which controlled much of the temple land in the country and the state finances, at the expense of the ruling pharaohs. The Turin 1887 papyrus records a financial scandal during Ramesses' reign that involved the priests of Elephantine. A period of domestic instability also afflicted his reign, as evidenced by the fact that, according to the Turin Papyrus Cat. 2044, the workmen of Deir el-Medina periodically stopped work on Ramesses V's KV9 tomb in this king's first regnal year, out of fear of \\"the enemy\\", presumably Libyan raiding parties, who had reached the town of Per-Nebyt and \\"burnt its people.\\"A.J. Peden, The Reign of Ramesses IV, (Aris & Phillips Ltd: 1994), p.21 Peden's source on these recorded disturbances is KRI, VI, 340-343 Another incursion by these raiders into Thebes is recorded a few days later.Peden, p.21 This shows that the Egyptian state was having difficulties ensuring the security of its own elite tomb workers, let alone the general populace, during this troubled time. The Wilbour Papyrus, believed to date to Year 4 of Ramesses V's reign, was a major land survey and tax assessment document which covered various lands \\"extending from near Crocodilopolis (Medinet el-Fayyum) southwards to a little short of the modern town of El-Minya, a distance of some 90 miles.\\"Alan Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs, 1961 It reveals most of Egypt's land was controlled by the Amun temples, which also directed the country's finances. The document highlights the increasing power of the High Priest of Amun Ramessesnakht whose son, a certain Usimare'nakhte, held the office of chief tax master. Death The circumstances of Ramesses V's death are unknown but it is believed he had a reign of almost four full years. It is possible he was dethroned by his paternal uncle and successor, Ramesses VI because Ramesses VI usurped his predecessor's KV9 tomb.Peter Clayton, Chronology of the Pharaohs, Thames & Hudson Ltd, (1994), p.168 An ostracon records that this king was only buried in Year 2 of Ramesses VI, which was highly irregular since Egyptian tradition required a king to be mummified and buried precisely 70 days into the reign of his successor.Clayton, p.167 Ramesses V's mummified head. However, another reason for the much delayed burial of Ramesses V in Year 2, second month of Akhet day 1 of Ramesses VI's reign (see KRI, VI, 343) may have been connected with Ramesses VI's need \\"to clear out any Libyans [invaders] from Thebes and to provide a temporary tomb for Ramesses V until plans for a double burial within tomb KV9 could be put into effect.\\" Moreover, a Theban work journal (P. Turin 1923) dated to Year 2 of Ramesses VI's reign shows that a period of normality had returned to the Theban West Bank by this time. The mummy of Ramesses V was recovered in 1898 and seemed to indicate that he suffered and subsequently died from smallpox, due to lesions found on his face. He was thought to be one of the earliest known victims of the disease.Erik Hornung, \\"The Pharaoh\\" p.292 in The Egyptians (ed.) Sergio Donadoni and Robert Bianchi, University of Chicago Press, 1997 Donald, R. Hopkins, \\"Ramses V\\" While a 2016 discovery has found that the shared ancestral form of smallpox dates back to 1580 AD, this study merely indicates that the strains of smallpox circulating at the time of smallpox eradication had a common ancestor in the late 16th century, specifically that \\"the VARV lineages eradicated during the 20th century had only been in existence for ∼200 years, at a time of rapidly expanding human movement and population size in the face of increasingly widespread inoculation and vaccination.\\" Indeed, they say merely about ancient cases of smallpox that \\"if they were indeed due to smallpox, these early cases were caused by virus lineages that were no longer circulating at the point of eradication in the 1970s.\\" It is little surprise that the advent of vaccination or indeed even variolation in China and Japan during the middle ages could have altered the relative presence of smallpox strains and diminished the presence of ancient strains.https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/bt/smallpox/who/red- book/Chp%2006.pdf/ Early Efforts at Control: Variolation, Vaccination, and Isolation and Quarantine A 2015 review summarizing recent research into the question of smallpox evolution and divergence from its common ancestors suggests it is most likely that smallpox evolved 3000–4000 years ago in East Africa or India, which is not inherently contradicted by the study described the latter of which contains descriptions of smallpox from before the first century AD at least. Finally, another genomic analysis places the evolution of smallpox at even 16,000 years before present, and mentions Ramses V specifically, writing that \\"if the pustular eruption of Ramses V was from smallpox, it could represent a smallpox outbreak from imported cases... rather than regional endemic disease. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only three mummies in that period had similar lesions.\\" References Further reading * A.J.

Born in Damery, she first appeared professionally on the stage in Lille. After her Paris debut at the Comédie-Française in 1717, she was immensely popular with the public. Together with Michel Baron, she was credited for having developed a more natural, less stylized, type of acting. Despite the fame she gained as an actress and her innovations in her acting style, she was widely remembered for her romance with Maurice de Saxe and for her mysterious death.Probably from poison which was used almost in epidemic proportions during her era. See the chapter on the \\"Slow Poisoners\\" within Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay (pp. 565–592). Although there are different theories that suggest she was poisoned by her rival, the Duchess of Bouillon, scholars have not been able to confirm it. Her story was used as an inspiration for playwrights, composers and poets. The refusal of the Catholic Church to give her a Christian burial moved her friend Voltaire to write a poem on the subject. Life =Early years= Adrienne Lecouvreur was born on 5 April 1692, in the village of Damery in the province of Champagne. Her father, Robert Couvreur, was a hat maker who, in the hope of more lucrative opportunities, moved with his family to Paris. After the death of his wife, Marie Couvreur, Mr. Couvreur started frequenting taverns, leaving young Adrienne and her sister Marie Marguerite to fend for themselves. Young Adrienne found her own refuge watching rehearsals in the Comedie Francaise, and joining the rehearsals of a young, clandestine theater troupe that met in the back store of a grocer's shop on the rue Férou. The company premiered at the house of Madame de Gue, wife of a president of Parlement. They played Corneille's Polyeucte, with Adrienne Lecouvreur playing the role of Pauline. Marc-Antoine Legrand, a sociétaire of the Comédie-Française, was present at this performance, and, impressed by her skills, took her as his pupil, advising her to add the prefix \\"\\"le\\"\\" to her name; a particle usually added to noble family names. =Luneville= At age 14, Adrienne was already on tour. Her first public performances as a professional actress took place in Lille, where Mademoiselle Fonpré, who had been appointed director of the theatre, was taken aback by Lecouvreur's potential. Shortly after her début, she started getting roles playing tragic queens and princesses. Her next engagements after Lille were in Luneville, the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine. During this period, she had a daughter, Elisabeth-Adrienne, whose father was Philippe Le Roy, an officer who served the Duke Leopold of Lorraine. She was also engaged to a man referred in her writings as \\"Baron D.\\", but he died in an accident before they could marry. =Strasbourg= Shortly after Baron D's death, Adrienne Lecouvreur left Luneville, signing a contract with another theatre under the protection of the Duke of Lorraine; the theatre at Strasbourg. It was a time of great success for her. In Strasbourg, she met the young Count François de Klinglin, son of the city's chief magistrate. After months of visiting her, they announced their engagement, but one year into their commitment, Adrienne was expecting a second child. The shame of this impending wedding made the magistrate threaten his son with disinheritance, to which he gave in, calling off the engagement and agreeing to a new one, arranged by his family. In Strasbourg, Lecouvreur earned a considerable income. However, while she was relying on Baron D. and subsequently Klinglin's income beside her own, she incurred serious debt. Her engagements as an actress required her to pay for her own wardrobe and jewelry, and an actress of Adrienne's status were subject to high expectations in their adornment. Humiliated after Klinglin's arranged marriage, and with two children to support, Adrienne could no longer sustain herself in Strasbourg. In 1716, at age 24, she left for Paris, and in 1717 she received a letter from the first gentleman of the King's chamber, requesting her to join the Comédie-Francaise. The letter read: \\"We, Steward and Controller General of the King's silverplate, pleasures, and business of the King's Chamber, order His Majesty's Players (in accordance with the order of Monseigneur the Duc d'Aumont, Peer of France and First Gentleman of the Chamber) to invite Mademoiselle Lecouvreur, immediately after the seasonal opening of their theatre, to perform in a play of her own choosing, in order to judge of any talent she may have for the theatre. Done in Paris this 27th day of March, 1717.\\" =Paris= Adrienne Lecouvreur chose Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon's Electre and Molière's George Dandin in the role of Angélique. She made a surprising first appearance on stage. She wore a simple, white satin Grecian robe; not a heavily elaborated gown as was usual back then -- nor did she wear a heavy headdress, and her acting style was devoid of the typical artificial gestures of that time's declamatory style. In her first year (1717) she played Corneille and Racine (in particular the roles of Pulchérie in Heraclius, Monime, and Iphigénie), and Zenobia in Crébillon's play. In 1718 she played Aristie in Corneille's Sertorius and Atalide in Bajazet. In total she gave 139 performances that season; an outstanding number for a beginner, and the most she would give throughout her career. Acting Style Lecouvreur as Cornelia in Pierre Corneille’s The Death of Pompey, on a portrait by Charles-Antoine Coypel, located in the museum of the Comédie-Française, Paris Adrienne Lecouvreur was one of the first actresses who favored a more natural, realistic and less declamatory style. She and actor Michel Baron sought for a style that was based on everyday speech, as opposed to the predominant chantante style of the time. The playwright Pierre-François Godard de Beauchamps wrote on a letter to Mademoiselle Lecouvreur “Finally the true triumphs and the tragic furor give way, on the Stage, to the tender, the emotionally moving. You have made us know and feel the beauty of simplicity and its treasures.” Charles Collé mentions the direct connection that Adrienne Lecouvreur created between the audience and the role itself: “She develops all the details of a role and makes us forget the actress. We see nothing but the character she represents.” Lecouvreur took this search for a more natural style into another aspect of her work, her wardrobe. Regardless of the era in which a play had been written, it was customary for actresses to wear elaborate dresses that reflected the fashion of the time, and sophisticated plumed headdresses. Lecouvreur, however, made her first appearance at the Comedie Francaise wearing a simple Greek tunic in white satin to play Crebillon’s Electre. Legacy Aleardo Villa – Francesco Cilea's opera Adriana Lecouvreur Her life became the inspiration for a tragic 1849 drama Adrienne Lecouvreur by Scribe and Legouvé on which Francesco Cilea's opera Adriana Lecouvreur and the operetta Adrienne (1926) by Walter Goetze are based. Before them, however, in 1856, Edoardo Vera premiered his \\"dramma lirico\\" Adriana Lecouvreur e la duchessa di Bouillon. In 1913 Sarah Bernhardt played her in the silent movie Adrienne Lecouvreur.

The device was widely promoted by then-Apple director Larry Ellison, apparently as part of his Oracle Network Computer initiative. The Mac NC was ultimately never released, although key components of its technology were inherited by the original iMac, which was released in August 1998. History On May 21, 1996, Oracle Corporation, along with 30 hardware and software vendors, announced an intent to build computers that are designed around the network computer platform. The idea was to design technology based on a profile that included diskless computers, commonly coded applications using languages such as Java, and interface with the internet using common software such as Netscape Navigator. In May 1996, Apple became a partner in the network computing effort, and used the Apple Pippin platform as its implementation. On July 9, 1997, Gil Amelio was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors. Steve Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO, to begin a critical restructuring of the company's product line. He would eventually become CEO and served in that position until August 2011. Oracle Corporation CEO and Apple board member Larry Ellison announced in December 1997, while talking to the Harvard Computer Society, that Apple would release a product called the Macintosh NC in April 1998. He suggested the network computer would have a \\"near-300 MHz\\" processor and a 17-inch screen, and would sell for less than US$1,000 (with a hard disk drive available as an extra costing an additional $100). Steve Jobs did not agree, stating, \\"Unfortunately, [Ellison] is pretty far off base\\" in an e-mail. \\"Maybe he is trying to deflect interest from what we are really doing.\\"Apple Prototype While at Oracle, Ellison had overseen the development of a business alliance that produced a number of Network Computer-branded devices from companies such as Sun and IBM. Apple never manufactured any devices under the Oracle alliance, but did endorse the Network Computer Reference Profile. Steve Jobs had already stopped all Macintosh clone efforts, which would shut down the Apple Pippin concept and any prospects of the Mac NC. Ultimately the technology shipped as NetBoot with the release of Mac OS X Server 1.0 in January 1999.

As the hyperfocal distance is the focus distance giving the maximum depth of field, it is the most desirable distance to set the focus of a fixed-focus camera. The hyperfocal distance is entirely dependent upon what level of sharpness is considered to be acceptable. The hyperfocal distance has a property called \\"consecutive depths of field\\", where a lens focused at an object whose distance is at the hyperfocal distance H will hold a depth of field from H/2 to infinity, if the lens is focused to H/2, the depth of field will extend from H/3 to H; if the lens is then focused to H/3, the depth of field will extend from H/4 to H/2, etc. Thomas Sutton and George Dawson first wrote about hyperfocal distance (or \\"focal range\\") in 1867. Louis Derr in 1906 may have been the first to derive a formula for hyperfocal distance. Rudolf Kingslake wrote in 1951 about the two methods of measuring hyperfocal distance. Some cameras have their hyperfocal distance marked on the focus dial. For example, on the Minox LX focusing dial there is a red dot between 2 m and infinity; when the lens is set at the red dot, that is, focused at the hyperfocal distance, the depth of field stretches from 2 m to infinity.  Two methods  There are two common methods of defining and measuring hyperfocal distance, leading to values that differ only slightly. The distinction between the two meanings is rarely made, since they have almost identical values. The value computed according to the first definition exceeds that from the second by just one focal length. Definition 1: The hyperfocal distance is the closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at infinity acceptably sharp. When the lens is focused at this distance, all objects at distances from half of the hyperfocal distance out to infinity will be acceptably sharp. Definition 2: The hyperfocal distance is the distance beyond which all objects are acceptably sharp, for a lens focused at infinity. Acceptable sharpness The hyperfocal distance is entirely dependent upon what level of sharpness is considered to be acceptable. The criterion for the desired acceptable sharpness is specified through the circle of confusion (CoC) diameter limit. This criterion is the largest acceptable spot size diameter that an infinitesimal point is allowed to spread out to on the imaging medium (film, digital sensor, etc.). Formulae For the first definition, :H = \\\\frac{f^2}{N c} + f where :H is hyperfocal distance :f is focal length :N is f-number (f/D for aperture diameter D) :c is the circle of confusion limit For any practical f-number, the added focal length is insignificant in comparison with the first term, so that :H \\\\approx \\\\frac{f^2}{N c} This formula is exact for the second definition, if H is measured from a thin lens, or from the front principal plane of a complex lens; it is also exact for the first definition if H is measured from a point that is one focal length in front of the front principal plane. For practical purposes, there is little difference between the first and second definitions. =Derivation using geometric optics= Accompanying figures The following derivations refer to the accompanying figures. For clarity, half the aperture and circle of confusion are indicated. Definition 1 An object at distance H forms a sharp image at distance x (blue line). Here, objects at infinity have images with a circle of confusion indicated by the brown ellipse where the upper red ray through the focal point intersects the blue line. First using similar triangles hatched in green, :\\\\begin{array}{crcl} & \\\\dfrac{x-f}{c/2} & = & \\\\dfrac{f}{D/2}  \\\\therefore & x-f & = & \\\\dfrac{cf}{D}  \\\\therefore & x & = & f+\\\\dfrac{cf}{D} \\\\end{array} Then using similar triangles dotted in purple, :\\\\begin{array}{crclcl} & \\\\dfrac{H}{D/2} & = & \\\\dfrac{x}{c/2}  \\\\therefore & H & = & \\\\dfrac{Dx}{c} & = & \\\\dfrac{D}{c}\\\\Big(f+\\\\dfrac{cf}{D}\\\\Big)  & & = & \\\\dfrac{Df}{c}+f & = & \\\\dfrac{f^2}{Nc}+f \\\\end{array} :::as found above. Definition 2 Objects at infinity form sharp images at the focal length f (blue line). Here, an object at H forms an image with a circle of confusion indicated by the brown ellipse where the lower red ray converging to its sharp image intersects the blue line. Using similar triangles shaded in yellow, :\\\\begin{array}{crclcl} & \\\\dfrac{H}{D/2} & = & \\\\dfrac{f}{c/2}  \\\\therefore & H & = & \\\\dfrac{Df}{c} & = & \\\\dfrac{f^2}{Nc} \\\\end{array} Example As an example, for a 50 mm lens at f/8 using a circle of confusion of 0.03 mm, which is a value typically used in 35 mm photography, the hyperfocal distance according to Definition 1 is :H = \\\\frac{(50)^2}{(8)(0.03)} + (50) = 10467 \\\\mbox{ mm} If the lens is focused at a distance of 10.5 m, then everything from half that distance (5.2 m) to infinity will be acceptably sharp in our photograph. With the formula for the Definition 2, the result is 10417 mm, a difference of 0.5%.  Consecutive depths of field  The hyperfocal distance has a curious property: while a lens focused at H will hold a depth of field from H/2 to infinity, if the lens is focused to H/2, the depth of field will extend from H/3 to H; if the lens is then focused to H/3, the depth of field will extend from H/4 to H/2. This continues on through all successive 1/x values of the hyperfocal distance. Piper (1901) calls this phenomenon \\"consecutive depths of field\\" and shows how to test the idea easily. This is also among the earliest of publications to use the word hyperfocal. The figure on the right illustrates this phenomenon. History This early use of the term hyperfocal distance, Derr 1906, is by no means the earliest explanation of the concept. The concepts of the two definitions of hyperfocal distance have a long history, tied up with the terminology for depth of field, depth of focus, circle of confusion, etc. Here are some selected early quotations and interpretations on the topic. =Sutton and Dawson 1867= Thomas Sutton and George Dawson define focal range for what we now call hyperfocal distance: Their focal range is about 1000 times their aperture diameter, so it makes sense as a hyperfocal distance with CoC value of f/1000, or image format diagonal times 1/1000 assuming the lens is a “normal” lens. What is not clear, however, is whether the focal range they cite was computed, or empirical. =Abney 1881= Sir William de Wivelesley Abney says: That is, a is the reciprocal of what we now call the f-number, and the answer is evidently in meters. His 0.41 should obviously be 0.40. Based on his formulae, and on the notion that the aperture ratio should be kept fixed in comparisons across formats, Abney says: =Taylor 1892= John Traill Taylor recalls this word formula for a sort of hyperfocal distance: This formula implies a stricter CoC criterion than we typically use today. =Hodges 1895= John Hodges discusses depth of field without formulas but with some of these relationships: This \\"mathematically\\" observed relationship implies that he had a formula at hand, and a parameterization with the f-number or “intensity ratio” in it. To get an inverse-square relation to focal length, you have to assume that the CoC limit is fixed and the aperture diameter scales with the focal length, giving a constant f-number. =Piper 1901= C. Welborne Piper may be the first to have published a clear distinction between Depth of Field in the modern sense and Depth of Definition in the focal plane, and implies that Depth of Focus and Depth of Distance are sometimes used for the former (in modern usage, Depth of Focus is usually reserved for the latter). He uses the term Depth Constant for H, and measures it from the front principal focus (i. e., he counts one focal length less than the distance from the lens to get the simpler formula), and even introduces the modern term: It is unclear what distinction he means. Adjacent to Table I in his appendix, he further notes: At this point we do not have evidence of the term hyperfocal before Piper, nor the hyphenated hyper-focal which he also used, but he obviously did not claim to coin this descriptor himself. =Derr 1906= Louis Derr may be the first to clearly specify the first definition, which is considered to be the strictly correct one in modern times, and to derive the formula corresponding to it. Using p for hyperfocal distance, D for aperture diameter, d for the diameter that a circle of confusion shall not exceed, and f for focal length, he derives: :p = \\\\frac{(D + d) f}{d} As the aperture diameter, D is the ratio of the focal length, f to the numerical aperture, N; and the diameter of the circle of confusion, c = d, this gives the equation for the first definition above. :p = \\\\frac{(\\\\tfrac{f}{N} + c) f}{c} = \\\\frac{f^2}{N c} + f =Johnson 1909= George Lindsay Johnson uses the term Depth of Field for what Abney called Depth of Focus, and Depth of Focus in the modern sense (possibly for the first time), as the allowable distance error in the focal plane. His definitions include hyperfocal distance: His drawing makes it clear that his e is the radius of the circle of confusion. He has clearly anticipated the need to tie it to format size or enlargement, but has not given a general scheme for choosing it. Johnson's use of former and latter seem to be swapped; perhaps former was here meant to refer to the immediately preceding section title Depth of Focus, and latter to the current section title Depth of Field. Except for an obvious factor-of-2 error in using the ratio of stop diameter to CoC radius, this definition is the same as Abney's hyperfocal distance. =Others, early twentieth century= The term hyperfocal distance also appears in Cassell's Cyclopaedia of 1911, The Sinclair Handbook of Photography of 1913, and Bayley's The Complete Photographer of 1914. =Kingslake 1951= Rudolf Kingslake is explicit about the two meanings: Kingslake uses the simplest formulae for DOF near and far distances, which has the effect of making the two different definitions of hyperfocal distance give identical values.

Early life Ledyard was born in Groton, Connecticut, in November 1751. He was the first child of Abigail and Capt. John Ledyard. A day or so after the child was born Capt. John boarded his (father's) ship and sailed for the West Indies. Three years later Ledyard joined his grandfather in Hartford, Connecticut, where he attended school. His grandfather died just before Ledyard turned 20 (Squire Ledyard died in September 1771 grandson John was about three months shy of 21 years of age at the Squire's death). Ledyard briefly attended Dartmouth College (which was then only 3 years old), arriving on 22 April 1772. He left for two months without permission in August and September of that year, led a mid-winter camping expedition, and finally abandoned the college for good in May 1773. Memorably, he fashioned his own dugout canoe, and paddled it for a week down the Connecticut River to his grandfather's farm. Today, the Ledyard Canoe Club, a division of the Dartmouth Outing Club, sponsors an annual canoe trip down the Connecticut River in his honor. At loose ends, he decided to travel; \\"I allot myself a seven year's ramble more,\\" he wrote to a cousin. He shipped as a common seaman on a year- long trading voyage to Gibraltar, the Barbary Coast, and the Caribbean. On his next voyage, he jumped ship in Portsmouth, England, but was soon impressed and forced to join the British Navy as a marine.  Captain Cook's third voyage  In June 1776, Ledyard joined Captain James Cook's third and final voyage as a British marine. The expedition lasted until October 1780. During these four years, its two ships stopped at the Sandwich Islands, Cape of Good Hope, the Prince Edward Islands off South Africa, the Kerguelen Islands, Tasmania, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Tahiti, and then Hawaii (first documented by the expedition). It continued to the northwest coast of North America, making Ledyard perhaps the first U.S. citizen to touch its western coast, along the Aleutian islands and Alaska into the Bering Sea, and back to Hawaii where Cook was killed. He attempted to climb from Kealakekua Bay to Mokuaweoweo, the summit of Mauna Loa, but had to turn back. The return voyage touched upon Kamchatka, Macau, Batavia (now Jakarta), around the Cape of Good Hope again, and back to England. Still a marine in the British Navy, Ledyard was sent to Canada to fight in the American Revolution. Instead he deserted, returned to Dartmouth, and began to write his Journal of Captain Cook's Last Voyage. It was published in 1783, five years after he had visited Hawaii, and was the first work to be protected by copyright in the United States. (It was in fact protected by Connecticut state copyright by special act of the legislature; federal copyright was not introduced until 1790.) Today, this work is annotated in rare-book bibliographies as the first travelogue describing Hawaii ever to be published in America.  Fur trade  As Ledyard had noticed that sea otter furs from the American northwest commanded extremely high prices in Macau, he lobbied during the early 1780s for the formation of fur- trading companies. Ledyard suggested trading furs for Chinese silk and porcelain, which could then be sold in the United States. Although his partnership with Philadelphia financier Robert Morris was not successful, it did lay the pattern of the subsequent China trade. Ledyard left the United States in June 1784 to find financial backers in Europe. In Paris he partnered with John Paul Jones; however this venture, too, failed to reach fruition.  Overland around the world  In Paris, Ledyard conceived a remarkably bold scheme of exploration with encouragement from Thomas Jefferson, then American ambassador, and with financial backing from the Marquis de Lafayette, botanist Joseph Banks, and John Adams' son-in-law, William Smith. Jefferson suggested that Ledyard explore the American continent by proceeding overland through Russia, crossing at the Bering Strait, and heading south through Alaska and then across the American West to Virginia. Ledyard left London in December 1786, and made it most of the way across Russia. He left St. Petersburg in June 1787 to travel through Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Omsk, Tomsk, Irkutsk, and Kirensk, reaching Yakutsk after 11 weeks. Here he stopped for the winter but then returned to Irkutsk to join a larger expedition led by Joseph Billings (of the Cook voyage). However, Ledyard was arrested under orders from Empress Catherine the Great in February 1788, returned to Moscow by approximately his original route, then deported to Poland.  African expedition  Back in London, Ledyard came across the African Association, then recruiting explorers for Africa. Ledyard proposed an expedition from the Red Sea to the Atlantic. He arrived in Alexandria in August 1788, but the expedition was slow to start. Late in November 1788, Ledyard accidentally poisoned himself with vitriolic acid (sulfuric acid) and died in Cairo, Egypt on 10 January 1789. John Ledyard was buried in the sand dunes lining the Nile in a modestly marked grave, the location of which is unknown today.Oren, Michael. Power, Faith, and Fantasy. W.W. Norton & Company.

(Italian pronunciation: [bernarˈdino ramats'tsini]) Ramazzini, along with Francesco Torti, was an early proponent of the use of cinchona bark (from which quinine is derived) in the treatment of malaria. His most important contribution to medicine was his book on occupational diseases, De Morbis Artificum Diatriba (\\"Diseases of Workers\\"). Life Ramazzini was born in Carpi on 4 October 1633 according to his birth certificate. He studied medicine at the University of Parma, where his interest in occupational diseases began. Career He was appointed to the chair of theory of medicine at University of Modena in 1682 then served as professor of medicine at the University of Padua from 1700 until his death. He is often called \\"the father of occupational medicine\\" The first edition of De Morbis was published in 1700 in Modena, the second in 1713 in Padua. =Occupational medicine= Frontpage of the definitive 1713 edition of the Diatriba From the presentation given in occasion of the tercentenary of Ramazzini's death – Padua and São Paulo, 2015 List of occupations - From the presentation given at the Ramazzini Days, Carpi, 2000 His book on occupational diseases, De Morbis Artificum Diatriba (Diseases of Workers) outlined the health hazards of chemicals, dust, metals, repetitive or violent motions, odd postures, and other disease- causative agents encountered by workers in more than fifty occupations. This was one of the founding and seminal works of occupational medicine and played a substantial role in its development. A PDF copy of the article.

Ramazzini saw prevention as being better than cure. In his Oratio given in 1711, he suggested that \\"it is much better to prevent than to cure, and so much easier to foresee future harm and avoid it rather than have to get rid of it after having fallen prey\\". =Malaria= In regards to malaria, Ramazzini was one of the first to support the use of the quinine-rich bark cinchona. Many falsely claimed that quinine was toxic and ineffective, but Ramazzini recognized its importance. He is quoted, \\"It [quinine] did for medicine what gun powder did for war.\\" =Cancer= In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini said that nuns developed breast cancer at a higher rate than married women, because they did not engage in sexual intercourse, and the \\"unnatural\\" lack of sexual activity caused instability of the breast tissues that sometimes developed into breast cancer.

A Jewish doctor, who had fled Nazi Germany just before the start of the Second World War, he is considered to be one of the founding fathers of organised physical activities for people with a disability. Early life Dr Ludwig Guttmann, the eldest child of the family, was born in Tost, within Upper Silesia, Germany (now Toszek, Poland) on 3 July 1899. His family moved when he was three years old to the Silesia city of Königshütte (today Chorzów, Poland) where he passed his Abitur at the humanistic grammar school in 1917 before he was called up for military service. Early career Guttmann first encountered a patient with a toe injury in 1917, while he was volunteering at the Accident Hospital in Königshutte. The patient was a coal miner who later died of sepsis. Guttmann started his medical studies in April 1918 at the University of Breslau. He transferred to the University of Freiburg in 1919 and received his Doctorate of Medicine in 1924. By 1933, Guttmann was working in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) as a neurosurgeon and lecturing at the university. Guttmann learned from the pioneer of neurosurgery Otfrid Foerster at his research institute. Despite having worked successfully as first assistant to Foerster, Guttmann was expelled from his university appointment and his job in 1933 under the Nuremberg Laws and his title changed to “Krankenbehandler” (one who treats the sick). With the arrival of the Nazis in power, Jews were banned from practising medicine professionally and he was assigned to work at the Breslau Jewish Hospital, where he became medical director in 1937. Following the violent attacks on Jewish people and properties during Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938, Guttmann ordered his staff to admit any patients without question. The following day he justified his decision on a case-by-case basis with the Gestapo. Out of 64 admissions, 60 patients were saved from arrest and deportation to concentration camps. Escape to Britain In early 1939, Guttmann and his family left Germany because of the Nazi persecution of the Jews. An opportunity for escape arose when the Nazis provided him with a visa and ordered him to travel to Portugal to treat a friend of the Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar. Guttmann was scheduled to return to Germany via London, where the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) arranged for him to remain in the UK. He arrived with his wife Else Samuel Guttmann and two children, a son, Dennis and daughter, Eva aged 6 in Oxford, England, on 14 March 1939. CARA negotiated with the British Home Office on their behalf, and gave Guttmann and his family £250 () to help settle in Oxford. Guttmann continued his spinal injury research at the Nuffield Department of Neurosurgery in the Radcliffe Infirmary. For the first few weeks after arrival the family resided in the Master's Lodge of Balliol College (with the Master Sandie Lindsay) until they moved into a small semi-detached house in Lonsdale Road. Both children were offered free places by the headmistress of Greycotes School. The family were members of the Oxford Jewish community, and Eva remembers becoming friendly with Miriam Margolyes, now a famous actress. The Jewish community in Oxford was growing rapidly as a result of the influx of displaced academic Jews from Europe. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Guttmann and his family stayed in the home of Lord Lindsay, CARA Councillor and Master of Balliol College. Stoke Mandeville Hospital  In September 1943, the British government asked Guttmann to establish the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. The initiative came from the Royal Air Force to ensure the treatment and rehabilitation of pilots with spine injuries, \\"who often crashed on approach with their bombers damaged\\".Jürgen Probst: Gedenken der jüdischen Mitglieder der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Unfallheilkunde, Versicherungs- und Versorgungsmedizin Orthopädie und Unfallchirurgie Mitteilungen und Nachrichten, October 2013, pp. 606–613. When the centre opened on 1 February 1944, the United Kingdom's first specialist unit for treating spinal injuries, Guttmann was appointed its director (a position he held until 1966). He believed that sport was an important method of therapy for the rehabilitation of injured military personnel, helping them build up physical strength and self-respect. Guttmann became a naturalised British citizen in 1945. He organised the first Stoke Mandeville Games for disabled war veterans, which was held at the hospital on 29 July 1948, the same day as the opening of the London Olympics. All participants had spinal cord injuries and competed in wheelchairs. In an effort to encourage his patients to take part in national events, Guttmann used the term Paraplegic Games. These came to be known as the \\"Paralympic Games\\", which later became the \\"Parallel Games\\" and grew to include other disabilities. Paralympics Guttmann presenting gold medal to Tony South at the 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv By 1952, more than 130 international competitors had entered the Stoke Mandeville Games. As the annual event continued to grow, the ethos and efforts by all those involved started to impress the organisers of the Olympic Games and members of the international community. At the 1956 Stoke Mandeville Games, Guttmann was awarded the Sir Thomas Fearnley Cup by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for his meritorious achievement in service to the Olympic movement through the social and human value derived from wheelchair sports. His vision of an international games, the equivalent of the Olympic Games themselves, was realised in 1960 when the International Stoke Mandeville Games were held alongside the official 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Known at the time as the 9th Annual International Stoke Mandeville Games, and organised with the support of the World Federation of Ex-servicemen (an International Working Group on Sport for the Disabled), they are now recognised as the first Paralympic Games. (The term \\"Paralympic Games\\" was retroactively applied by the IOC in 1984.) In 1961, Guttmann founded the British Sports Association for the Disabled, which would later become known as the English Federation of Disability Sport. Later life In 1961, Guttmann founded the International Medical Society of Paraplegia, now the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS); he was the inaugural president of the society, a position that he held until 1970. He became the first editor of the journal, Paraplegia (now named Spinal Cord). He retired from clinical work in 1966 but continued his involvement with sport. Guttmann suffered a heart attack in October 1979, and died on 18 March 1980 at the age of 80. Legacy Guttmann on a 2013 Russian stamp from the series \\"Sports Legends\\" Stoke Mandeville Stadium, the National Centre for Disability Sport in the United Kingdom, was developed by him alongside the hospital. A specialist neurorehabilitation hospital in Barcelona, the ', is named in his honour. The founder of this, the first rehabilitation clinic for paraplegics in Spain, was Guillermo González Gilbey, who himself suffered from paraplegia and made great progress in England with Ludwig Guttmann. In June 2012, a life- sized cast-bronze statue of Guttmann was unveiled at Stoke Mandeville Stadium as part of the run up to the London 2012 Summer Paralympics and Olympic Games. After the Games, it was moved to its permanent home at the National Spinal Injuries Centre. Guttmann's daughter, Eva Loeffler, was appointed the mayor of the London 2012 Paralympic Games athletes' village. In August 2012, the BBC broadcast The Best of Men, a TV film about Guttmann's work at Stoke Mandeville during and after the Second World War. The film, written by Lucy Gannon, starred Eddie Marsan as Dr. Guttmann and Rob Brydon as one of the seriously injured patients, who were given a purpose in life by the doctor. The Sir Ludwig Guttmann Centre is an NHS facility providing GP, Orthopaedic and Sports and Exercise Medicine outpatient services as well as imaging on the site of the 2012 Olympic village. The Sir Ludwig Guttmann Lectureship was established by the International Medical Society of Paraplegia (now ISCoS) to recognize Guttmann's pioneering work and lifelong contribution to spinal cord care. The Ludwig Guttmann Prize of the German Medical Society for Paraplegia is awarded for \\"excellent scientific work in the field of clinical research on spinal cord injury\\". Honours As \\"Neurological Surgeon in charge of the Spinal Injuries Centre at the Ministry of Pensions Hospital, Stoke Mandeville\\", he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1950 King's Birthday Honours. On 28 June 1957, he was made an Associate Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John. He was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1960, and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1966. On 24 October 2013, a commemorative plaque was unveiled by the Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) at the National Spinal Injuries Centre to honour Guttmann's life and work. As an active member of the AJR, he had served on the board for over 25 years. Selected publications * 1959. The Place of Our Spinal Paraplegic Fellow-Man in Society: A Survey on 2000 Patients.

Biography Sparks was born in Darrah parish, County Wexford in Ireland and came to Canada in 1816. He was recruited by Ruggles Wright (or by other accounts Ruggles' brother Philemon Jr.) at age twenty-four to voyage to Canada as a labourer in the Wright family's logging and farming enterprises in the location of modern Gatineau. By 1819 he was traveling to Montreal and Quebec, purchasing supplies for Wright. On 25 September 1823, after saving his salary for several years, Sparks purchased 200(0.8 km²) acres of land - along with some food and chattels - on the south side of the Ottawa River. He purchased the lot from John Burrows Honey (later known as John Burrows), a surveyor. The land was lot C, concession C, Nepean Township, which covered much of what is today downtown Ottawa stretching from what is today Wellington Street in the north to Laurier Avenue in the south. It stretched west to modern Bronson Avenue and extended eastwards further than the Rideau Canal (to Waller) into what is today Sandy Hill. South of his land was the land of Colonel By. Sparks borrowed £95, to complete the transaction for land that today is in the central business core of Ottawa. Historian Michael S. Cross wrote: :Lot C would become Sparks’ life, the basis of his fortune and status. Defending his right to the property would preoccupy him for much of his career. Indeed Sparks’ difficulties over the lot began immediately. Burrows Honey, it appears, had sold land he did not own. Although the original sale took place on 25 Sept. 1821, Burrows Honey did not receive clear title until 1823 for the south half and 1824 for the north half. The sale to Sparks, therefore, was not recorded at the county registry office until 20 June 1824. The confusion, which has led to considerable controversy among local historians over the purchase date, did not end there. Burrows Honey’s title remained in doubt. As a result, Sparks repurchased the south 100 acres on 20 June 1826. Still there were doubts; Sparks made token payments of 5s. to John Burrows Honey and to his wife for title to the full 200 acres on 6 May and 10 July 1830 respectively. Out of this tangle it appears the famous purchase was not made on the usually accepted date of 20 June 1826 but rather nearly five years earlier on 25 Sept. 1821, although the legal technicalities were not resolved until 1830. :The 1826 date, however, has a fine touch of drama about it. Late in 1826 the decision was made to build the Rideau Canal through lot C. As the village of Bytown (Ottawa) sprang up around the canal terminus, Sparks became landlord for a whole community. Those months also saw Sparks cement the other foundation of his fortune. On 2 Nov. 1826 a marriage license was issued to Sparks and Sally Olmstead, widow of Philemon Wright Jr. The marriage solidified Sparks’ link with the leadership of the Ottawa timber trade. :It was in land that Sparks reaped the greatest dividends. He began to sell portions of lot C as early as 18 Dec. 1826 when he sold land west of the canal mouth for £200 an acre, the same land he had bought for 9s. 6d. an acre. Land sales and leases quickly made Sparks wealthy. As one of the few people with ready cash he also became Bytown’s leading moneylender and often enough was able to regain land he had sold. For example, in January 1832 he accepted a lot in payment of a debt of £75. In May 1832 Sparks sold an adjacent lot for £600. The nicest irony in all of Sparks’ complex dealings came in July 1844 when he leased part of a town lot, 66 ft by 99 ft, for £200 to John Burrows. The building of the final section of the canal saw the government expropriate the eastern section of his land, taking everything east of modern Elgin Street (then known as Biddy's Lane). While losing some of his land, this proved a benefit for Sparks as the location of the canal greatly increased the value of his other holdings. Sparks donated about 20 acres of land towards the canal's construction. Sparks also donated land for civic buildings. He donated land for St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, and for a new court house and fire station. When his West Ward Market, unable to compete with Lower Town's Byward Market, failed he donated the building to become Bytown's first city hall. In 1832, he donated some land at the northwest corner of his property to the Anglican Church and that is still the site of Ottawa's Christ Church Cathedral. Sparks set out to encourage the establishment of commercial ventures on his property, which had proven to be poor farmland. Thus he established a market. While Ottawa remained a small town and commerce centered somewhat to the north of Sparks' holdings he became wealthy as a result of his land; further enhanced after 1857, with the selection of Ottawa as the capital of Province of Canada. In 1827, the government had seized some of Sparks' holdings intending to construct a fortress to defend the new canal. Sparks challenged this appropriation of the land, between Bank Street and the Canal, which lay unused for years. He succeeded and was awarded a fortune of 27,000 pounds for the land. With this money he invested in enterprises across the region, and became a financier in the town. The Rideau Canal Act of February 1827, by the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada expropriated 104 acres of Nicholas Sparks' land, not returned to him until 1847 or late 1849. Around 1848, he had a street created through the center of his holdings; this would later be known as Sparks Street, one of Ottawa's central commercial areas. In 1847, he became a member of Bytown's first town council. When the new city of Ottawa was created to replace Bytown in 1855, Sparks also served on its council until 1860. Sparks' descendants continued to be prominent citizens in Ottawa for many generations, for example Percy Sparks spearheaded the creation of Gatineau Park. Today there are many Sparks still living in Ottawa.

The rule also prevents parties who have reduced their agreement to a final written document from later introducing other evidence, such as the content of oral discussions from earlier in the negotiation process, as evidence of a different intent as to the terms of the contract. The rule provides that \\"extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to vary a written contract\\". The term \\"parol\\" derives from the Anglo-Norman French parol or parole, meaning \\"word of mouth\\" or \\"verbal\\", and in medieval times referred to oral pleadings in a court case.\\"Parol\\", Black's Law Dictionary, 10th ed. (2014). The rule's origins lie in English contract law, but has been adopted in other common law jurisdictions; however there are now some differences between application of the rule in different jurisdictions. For instance, in the US, a common misconception is that it is a rule of evidence (like the Federal Rules of Evidence), but that is not the case;Casa Herrera, Inc. v. Beydoun, 32 Cal. 4th 336, 9 Cal. Rptr. 3d 97, 83 P.3d 497 (2004). This case reaffirmed that the parol evidence rule is a substantive rule of law and not a mere procedural or evidentiary defense, and then held on that basis that a dismissal of a case on the basis of the parol evidence rule is a favorable termination on the merits sufficient to support a subsequent action for malicious prosecution. whereas in England it is indeed a rule of evidence.Leduc v WardPym v Campbell [1856] Henderson v Arthur [1907] CA The supporting rationale for this is that since the contracting parties have reduced their agreement to a single and final writing, extrinsic evidence of past agreements or terms should not be considered when interpreting that writing, as the parties had decided to ultimately leave them out of the contract. In other words, one may not use evidence made prior to the written contract to contradict the writing. Overview The rule applies to parol evidence, as well as other extrinsic evidence (such as written correspondence that does not form a separate contract) regarding a contract. If a contract is in writing and final to at least one term (integrated), parol or extrinsic evidence will generally be excluded.. However, there are a number of exceptions to this general rule, including for partially integrated contracts, agreements with separate consideration, to resolve ambiguities, or to establish contract defenses. To take an example, Carl agrees in writing to sell Betty a car for $1,000, but later, Betty argues that Carl earlier told her that she would only need to pay Carl $800. The parol evidence rule would generally prevent Betty from testifying to this alleged conversation because the testimony ($800) would directly contradict the written contract's terms ($1,000). The precise extent of the rule varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As a preliminary or threshold issue, the court may first determine if the agreement was in fact totally reduced to a written document or (in US terminology) fully \\"integrated\\". In the case of State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd McHugh J held the parol evidence rule has 'no operation until it is first determined' that all the terms of the contract are in writing.State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd (1986) 7 NSWLR 170 at 191, NSW Court of Appeal LawCite records. This threshold question applies even in those jurisdictions that apply a very strong form of the parol evidence rule, called the \\"Four Corners Rule\\". Beyond that, the exceptions to the parol evidence rule vary between jurisdictions. Examples of circumstances where extrinsic evidence may be admissible in different jurisdictions include: * To prove the parties to a contract. A written agreement to sell land signed by Mrs Kenny at times made reference to Mr Kenny, and the court held that oral evidence was admissible and that she was signing for herself and as an agent for her husband.Gilberto v Kenny (1983) 155 CLR 691 (15 February 1983) High Court (Australia). * To prove a condition precedent. In Pym v Campbell (1865) 119 ER 903, Pym entered into a written contract with Campbell to sell an interest in an invention. The court allowed Campbell to include the oral terms of acknowledgement that the sale was subject to an inspection and approval by an engineer. The engineer did not approve the invention. * To prove that the written document is only part of the contract as in Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation,. where the court found for a written contract to be only part of an agreement. In State Rail Authority of NSW v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd the court held that the parol evidence rule is persuasive and the evidenciary burden is on the party wishing to establish that the whole contract was not in writing. * To prove that an implied term of custom or trade usage or past dealings is part of a contract even if not in a written agreement, as in Hutton v Warren [1836] 1 M and W 466, where the party wishing to add the term bears the evidenciary burden and in this case, a lease had to be read in the light of established custom. * To prove what is true consideration, not something added to avoid taxes. * To prove the term or promise is part of a collateral contract.. * To aid in the interpretation of existing terms. * To resolve ambiguity using the contra proferentem rule. * To show, particularly in California, that (1) in light of all the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, the contract is actually ambiguous (regardless of whether the contract's meaning appears unambiguous at first glance), (2) thus necessitating the use of extrinsic evidence to determine its actual meaning.Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage Co., 69 Cal. 2d 33, 39, 69 Cal. Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641 (1968). Pacific Gas & Electric is one of Roger Traynor's most famous (and controversial) opinions, which has been criticized by a number of prominent jurists, including Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See Trident Center v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 847 F.2d 564 (9th Cir. 1988) and Jeffrey W. Stempel, Stempel on Insurance Contracts, 3rd ed., § 4.02, 4-9, n.16 (2006). * To disprove the validity of the contract. * To show that an unambiguous term in the contract is in fact a mistaken transcription of a prior valid agreement. Such a claim must be established by clear and convincing evidence, and not merely by the preponderance of the evidence. * To correct mistakes. * To show wrongful conduct such as misrepresentation, fraud, duress, unconscionability (276 N.E.2d 144, 147), or illegal purpose on the part of one or both parties. * To show that consideration has not actually been paid. For example, if the contract states that A has paid B $1,000 in exchange for a painting, B can introduce evidence that A had never actually conveyed the $1,000. * To identify the parties, especially if the parties have changed names. * To imply or incorporate a term of the contract. * To make changes in the contract after the original final contract has been agreed to. That is, oral statements can be admitted unless they are barred by a clause in the written contract.Wollner KS. (1999). How to Draft and Interpret Insurance Policies, p 10. Casualty Risk Publishing LLC. In order for evidence to fall within this rule, it must involve either (1) a written or oral communication made prior to execution of the written contract; or (2) an oral communication made contemporaneous with execution of the written contract. Evidence of a later communication will not be barred by this rule, as it is admissible to show a later modification of the contract (although it might be inadmissible for some other reason, such as the Statute of frauds). Similarly, evidence of a collateral agreement - one that would naturally and normally be included in a separate writing - will not be barred. For example, if A contracts with B to paint B's house for $1,000, B can introduce extrinsic evidence to show that A also contracted to paint B's storage shed for $100. The agreement to paint the shed would logically be in a separate document from the agreement to paint the house. Though its name suggests that it is a procedural evidence rule, the consensus of courts and commentators is that the parol evidence rule constitutes substantive contract law. Examples The parol evidence rule is a common trap for consumers. For example: * Health club contracts. You enroll in a health club, and the salesperson tells you that the contract can be cancelled. You later decide you would like to cancel, but the written contract provides that it is non-cancellable. The oral promises of the salesperson are generally non-enforceable. However, the salesperson in misleading you into the terms of the contract constitutes a misrepresentation and you may seek to rescind the contract. It may also be a violation of Consumer protection law, which may have its own remedies. * Auto sales agreements. You purchase a used car, and the salesperson tells you it is \\"good as new\\", but the contract provides that the sale is as is. Again, in most circumstances the written contract controls. However, this may constitute misrepresentation if it exceeds reasonably accepted \\"puffing\\" or \\"dealers' talk\\".Vulcan Metals Co. v. Simmons Mfg. Co., 248 F. 853, 856 (2d Cir. 1918). * Timeshares. While in certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, a consumer may have a right of rescission, some people attend real estate sales presentations at which they may feel pressured into immediately signing binding contracts. Evidence that the contract was entered into under duress will not be precluded by the parol evidence rule. Specific jurisdictions United States In order for the rule to be effective, the contract in question must first be a final integrated writing; it must, in the judgment of the court, be the final agreement between the parties (as opposed to a mere draft, for example). A final agreement is either a partial or complete integration, provided that it has an agreement on its face indicating its finality. If it contains some, but not all, of the terms as to which the parties have agreed then it is a partial integration. This means that the writing was a final agreement between the parties (and not mere preliminary negotiations) as to some terms, but not as to others. On the other hand, if the writing were to contain all of the terms as to which the parties agreed, then it would be a complete integration. One way to ensure that the contract will be found to be a final and complete integration is through the inclusion of a merger clause, which recites that the contract is, in fact, the whole agreement between the parties. However, many modern cases have found merger clauses to be only a rebuttable presumption. The importance of the distinction between partial and complete integrations is relevant to what evidence is excluded under the parol evidence rule. For both complete and partial integrations, evidence contradicting the writing is excluded under the parol evidence rule. However, for a partial integration, terms that supplement the writing are admissible. To put it mildly, this can be an extremely subtle (and subjective) distinction. To put it simply, (1) If the parties intend a complete integration of the contract terms, no parol evidence within the scope of agreement is permitted. (2) If the parties intended a partial integrated agreement, no parol evidence that contradicts anything integrated is permitted. And (3), if the parol evidence is collateral, meaning it regards a different agreement, and does not contradict the integrated terms, and are not terms any reasonable person would always naturally integrate, then the rule does not apply and the evidence is admissible. In a minority of U.S. states, (Florida, Colorado, and Wisconsin), the parol evidence rule is extremely strong and extrinsic evidence is always barred from being used to interpret a contract. This is called the Four Corners Rule, and it is traditional/old. In a Four Corners Rule jurisdiction, there are two basic rules. First, the court will never allow parol evidence if the parties intended a full and completely integrated agreement, and second, the court will only turn to parol evidence if the terms available are wholly ambiguous. The policy is to prevent lying, to protect against doubtful veracity, to enable parties to rely dearly on written contracts, and for judicial efficiency. In most jurisdictions there are numerous exceptions to this rule, and in those jurisdictions, extrinsic evidence may be admitted for various purposes. This is called the Admission Rule. It favors liberalizing the admission of evidence to determine if the contract was fully integrated and to determine if the parol evidence is relevant. In these jurisdictions, such as California, one can bring in parol evidence even if the contract is unambiguous on its face, if the parol evidence creates ambiguity. The policy is to get to the actual truth. The third and final admissibility rule is that under the UCC § 2-202: Parol evidence cannot contradict a writing intended to be the \\"final expression\\" of the agreement integrated but may be explained or supplemented by (a) a course of dealing/usage of trade/ course of performance, and by (b) evidence of consistent additional terms unless the writing was also intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement. Additional information on the parol evidence rule may be found in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 213. Australia In New South Wales, if an entire agreement clause, does not exist in the contract terms, parol evidence rule is a default rule of a completely written contract that the admission of extrinsic evidence is not allowed, and the contract should be understood in an objective approach.. However there are two exceptions that could overcome the parol evidence rule that extrinsic evidence is admissible: Exception 1: the contract is an oral contract or partly written. Exception 2: parties may have entered into a collateral contract, or are establishing an estoppel, with rectification, condition precedent, the true consideration, ACL, implied terms. There are also exceptions to the parol evidence rule in construing a contract. The first exception is that there is evidence of trade usage, which is well-known, uniform and certain. Appleby v Pursell [1973] 2 NSWLR 879.Appleby v Pursell [1973] 2 NSWLR 879. AustLII search. Also, a narrow view of admissibility of extrinsic evidence has been taken, where evidence of surrounding circumstances is only admissible to resolve patent ambiguity,. latent ambiguity,. and inherent ambiguity in the meaning of the words of a contract.. The High Court in Electricity Generation Corporation v Woodside Energy Ltd. took a different approach to interpreting commercial contracts, considering the \\"language used by the parties, the surrounding circumstances known to them and the commercial purpose or objects to be secured by the contract\\" at the \\"genesis of the transaction\\". This necessarily implies consideration of surrounding circumstances and indicates a broader approach may be adopted by the court in the future. The latest view is the narrow view which was described in Mount Bruce Mining Pty Limited v Wright Prospecting Pty Limited. In the New South Wales case of Saleh v Romanous, it was held that equitable estoppel triumphs common law rules of parol evidence.. See · 'L G Throne v Thomas Borthwick where the dissent of Herron J has been subsequently adopted.L G Throne v Thomas Borthwick Ltd [1955] 56 SR (NSW) 81. LawCite records. South Africa *In South Africa the Supreme Court of Appeal, beginning with the landmark ruling in KPMG Chartered Accountants (SA) v Securefin Ltd,(2009) 2 All SA 523 (SCA) par 39. redefined the rules relating to the admissibility of evidence that may be used in the interpretation of contracts in South Africa and in Dexgroup (Pty) Ltd v Trustco Group International (Pty) Ltd 2013 6 SA 520 (SCA). the Supreme Court of Appeal gave further clarity on these rules. The starting point is the language of the document and the parol evidence rule prevents evidence to add to, detract from or modify the words contained in the document. However, evidence to prove the meaning of the words, expressions, sentences and terms that constitute the contract, is admissible from the outset irrespective of whether there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in the text – as long as the evidence concerned points to a meaning which the text can reasonably have and the evidence is relevant to prove the common intention of the parties.Cornelius, Steve Redefining the Rules for the Admissibility of Evidence in the Interpretation of Contracts 2014 De Jure 363.

In January 1817, Austen began work on a new novel she called The Brothers, later titled Sanditon, and completed eleven chapters before stopping work in mid- March 1817, probably because of her illness.Claire Tomalin, Jane Austen. Page 261. R.W. Chapman first published a full transcription of the novel in 1925 under the name Fragment of a Novel. Plot The novel centres on Charlotte Heywood, the eldest of the daughters still at home in the large family of a country gentleman from Willingden, Sussex. The narrative opens when the carriage of Mr and Mrs Parker of Sanditon topples over on a hill near the Heywood home. Because Mr Parker is injured in the crash, and the carriage needs repairs, the Parkers stay with the Heywood family for a fortnight. During this time, Mr Parker talks fondly of Sanditon, a town which until a few years before had been a small, unpretentious fishing village. With his business partner, Lady Denham, Mr Parker hopes to make Sanditon into a fashionable seaside resort. Mr Parker's enormous enthusiasm for his plans to improve and modernise Sanditon has resulted in the installation of bathing machines and the construction of a new home for himself and his family near the seashore. Upon repair of the carriage and improvement to Mr Parker's foot, the Parkers return to Sanditon, bringing Charlotte with them as their summer guest. Upon arrival in Sanditon, Charlotte meets the inhabitants of the town. Prominent among them is Lady Denham, a twice-widowed woman who received a fortune from her first husband and a title from her second. Lady Denham lives with her poor niece Clara Brereton, who is a sweet and beautiful, yet impoverished, young lady. Also living in Sanditon are Sir Edward Denham and his sister Esther, Lady Denham's nephew and niece by her second husband. The siblings are poor and are thought to be seeking Lady Denham's fortune. Sir Edward is described as a silly and very florid man, though handsome. After settling in with the Parkers and encountering the various neighbours, Charlotte and Mr and Mrs Parker are surprised by a visit from his two sisters and younger brother, all of whom are self-declared invalids. However, given their level of activity and seeming strength, Charlotte quickly surmises that their complaints are invented. Diana Parker has come on a mission to secure a house for a wealthy family from the West Indies, although she has not specifically been asked for her aid. She also brings word of a second large party, a girls' school, which is intending to summer at Sanditon. This news causes a stir in the small town, especially for Mr Parker, whose fondest wish is the promotion of tourism in the town. With the arrival of Mrs Griffiths at Sanditon, it soon becomes apparent that the family from the West Indies and the girls' school group are one and the same. The visitors consist of Miss Lambe, a \\"half mulatto\\" rich young woman of about seventeen from the West Indies, and the two Miss Beauforts, common English girls. In short order, Lady Denham calls on Mrs Griffiths to be introduced to Miss Lambe, the very sickly and very rich heiress that she intends her nephew Sir Edward to marry. A carriage unexpectedly arrives bearing Sidney Parker, the second eldest Parker brother. He will be staying in town for a few days with two friends who will join him shortly. Sidney Parker is about 28 or 29 years old, and Charlotte finds him very good-looking with a decided air of fashion. The book fragment ends when Mrs Parker and Charlotte visit Sanditon House, Lady Denham's residence. There Charlotte spots Clara Brereton seated with Sir Edward Denham at her side having an intimate conversation in the garden and surmises that they must have a secret understanding. When they arrive inside, Charlotte observes that a large portrait of Sir Henry Denham hangs over the fireplace, whereas Lady Denham's first husband, who owned Sanditon House, only gets a miniature in the corner — obliged to sit back in his own house and see the best place by the fire constantly occupied by Sir Henry Denham. Characters * Mr. and Mrs Heywood – Prosperous gentleman farmer and his wife who open their home to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Parker when their carriage upsets nearby. It was written that the Heywoods would have been even more prosperous if they hadn't had 14 children. They do not care to travel, but have no objection to their children doing so if they have the opportunity. * Charlotte Heywood – Eldest of the daughters still at home. A nice, pretty girl who appears to be the heroine of the novel. Much of the story is told from her perspective. Charlotte Heywood is invited to experience the seaside at Sanditon with Mr. and Mrs Parker. * Mr. Thomas Parker – Oldest of the three Parker brothers. Middle-aged; fanatical over the health benefits of sea air and water. He and Lady Denham are invested in promoting Sanditon as a smaller Brighton. * Mrs. Thomas Parker (Mary) – Thomas' wife and mother of four children: Little Mary and three boys * Sidney Parker – The second brother, who is 28–29 years old living on his own. Good-looking, well bred, “air of ease and fashion and a lively countenance.” Most sources contend he was to be the hero and marry Charlotte; however, he is barely mentioned before Austen stopped writing and it is not known other characters she might have had in mind. He and his three siblings, Arthur, Susan, and Diana come to Sanditon for a visit. * Miss Susan Parker – Older of the two spinster Parker sisters. Hypochondriac * Miss Diana Parker – 34 years old. Hypochondriac when not busy being a nosy, self- satisfied, officious pest. * Arthur Parker – Youngest brother. 21 years old. Overweight hypochondriac. “Poor health” is his excuse to eat what he wants and sit lazily by the fire. Lives with his spinster sisters. * Lady Denham, née Brereton – 70 years old; twice widowed. Lives in Sanditon Hall, the largest house in town and home of her first husband. She was born wealthy but was not well educated. She inherited more money from her first husband, Mr. Hollis. Her title came from her poor, second husband Sir Harry Denham. Many family members, her own and her late husbands’, wish to inherit from her. * Sir Edward Denham – Sir Harry’s heir to the title but not to the money. He is insincere and sympathizes with loose morals. He would like to seduce Clara Brereton because she is “young, lovely, and dependent” and a rival for Lady Denham’s fortune. * Miss Esther Denham – Sister of Sir Edward. * Miss Clara Brereton – Poor distant cousin of Lady Denham who has been living with her for about a year. She is a “lovely and interesting young woman…Elegantly tall, regularly handsome, with great delicacy of complexion and soft blue eyes, (with) a sweetly modest and yet naturally graceful address”. * Mrs. Whitby – Runs the Library/General Store in Sanditon. * Miss Whitby – Helps with her mother business. * Young Whitby – Helps with his mother business. * Mr. and Mrs. Hillier – Mentioned as people now living in the Parker’s family home of several generations, since the oldest Mr. Parker built a modern new home named “Trafalgar”. * Mrs. Griffiths – Seems to be a professional chaperone who is paid to look after girls and introduce them around. * Miss Beaufort – One of Mrs. Griffiths’ charges, who plays the harp. Interested in trendy fashions and looking for a rich husband. * Miss Letitia Beaufort – Also a charge of Mrs. Griffith, who sketches. Younger sister to Miss Beaufort. Interested in trendy fashions and looking for a rich husband. * Miss Lambe – One of Mrs. Griffiths' charges. A 17 year old “half mulatto” heiress from the West Indies in poor health. Lady Denham wishes her relatively poor nephew Sir Edward to marry the girl. Analysis and background The people of \\"modern Sanditon\\", as Austen calls it, have moved out of the \\"old house – the house of [their] forefathers\\" and are busily constructing a new world in the form of a modern seaside commercial town. The town of Sanditon is almost certainly based on Worthing, where Jane Austen stayed in late 1805 when the resort was first being developed, while there is persuasive evidence that the character of Mr Parker was inspired by Edward Ogle, Worthing's early entrepreneur, whom Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra knew.Edmonds, Antony, “Jane Austen’s Worthing: The Real Sanditon” (Amberley, 2013)Lucy Worsley, “Jane Austen at Home” (Hodder & Stoughton, 2017), pages 417-419Clarke, Janet, Jane Austen Society Report 2008, pages 86–105Halperin, John, \\"Jane Austen's Anti-Romantic Fragment: Some Notes on Sanditon\\", 1983, University of Tulsa Sanditon is, however, less of an actual reality than an ideal of the inhabitants – one that they express in their descriptions of it. These inhabitants have a conception of the town's identity and of the way in which this identity should be spread to, and appreciated by, the world: :\\"My name perhaps… may be unknown at this distance from the coast – but Sanditon itself – everybody has heard of Sanditon, – the favourite – for a young and rising bathing-place, certainly the favourite spot of all that are to be found along the coast of Sussex; – the most favoured by nature, and promising to be the most chosen by man.\\" (Sanditon) Continuations and adaptations Because Austen completed setting the scene for Sanditon, it has been a favourite of \\"continuators\\" – later writers who try to complete the novel within Austen's vision while emulating her style. Such \\"completed\\" versions of Sanditon include: * Sanditon, by Jane Austen and \\"another lady\\", ; also published as Sanditon, by Jane Austen and Marie Dobbs, and Sanditon, by Jane Austen and Anne Telscombe, Marie Dobbs, an Australian journalist, published novels under the pseudonym \\"Anne Telscombe\\", and initially published Sanditon as \\"another lady\\" in 1975; later editions appear to have been published under all three names.

In Hill's novel, the village is renamed Sandytown, and lies on the Yorkshire coast. * Welcome to Sanditon, a modernised mini webseries adaptation set in California, produced by the creators of \\"The Lizzie Bennet Diaries\\" and premiered on 13 May 2013. Not continuing the story, the adaptation uses a deus ex machina to end where Austen left off, replacing Charlotte with [Fitz]William Darcy's sister, Georgiana (Gigi) from Pride and Prejudice. Near the end, William makes an appearance, pulling Gigi out from her role as Charlotte. *Sanditon, a television series adapted by Andrew Davies and shown on ITV from 25 August 2019.

Biography Born in Rome, Rainaldi was one of the leading architects of 17th century Rome, known for a certain grandeur in his designs. He worked at first with his father, Girolamo Rainaldi, a late Mannerist architect in Rome. After his father's death, he fully embraced the monumental Baroque style. He gained ascendancy in Rome when the Barberini pontificate of Pope Urban VIII was replaced by that of the more austere Pamphilj papacy of Innocent X. His works include the façade of Sant'Andrea della Valle (1661–1665), the twin churches of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in Montesanto, and Santa Maria in Campitelli (1663–1667). He was unable to complete the facade of Sant'Agnese in Agone during work in 1653-1657. Beyond his work as an architect in stone, Rainaldi also designed stage sets for religious rituals and events. In 1650, he designed the sets for the Quarant'ore, or Forty Hours Devotion, held in the church of Il Gesù. In 1665, he designed a catafalque commemorating the death of Philip IV of Spain. He also was a composer. Rainaldi died in Rome.

Background He was born at Stratford Hall Plantation in Westmoreland County, Virginia to Hon. Thomas Lee (1690–1750) and Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701–1750). His brothers, all also active within the Continental Congress, were Arthur Lee (1740–1792), Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734–1797) and Richard Henry Lee (1732–1794). Mercantile and political career Lee moved to London as a mercantile agent for Virginia in the tobacco trade and there married his heiress cousin Hannah Philippa Ludwell on March 7, 1769. After joining the Haberdashers Company he was appointed Sheriff of London for 1774 when Sheriff Plomer resigned. The other sheriff for that year, Stephen Sayes, was also American born. The position gave them the opportunity to press in high places the American case for less taxation and more representation. After his year as sheriff he was elected an Alderman and continued his campaign for American rights. He served as an agent of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution, and was posted to Berlin and Vienna but forced by the political situation to take up residence in Frankfurt. He attempted, but failed, to obtain support from Austria or Prussia. An unofficial U.S.-Dutch treaty that he helped draft became the cause of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Towards the end of the war he moved to Brussels, and then, leaving his wife and children there, returned to Virginia. His wife died suddenly in Ostend the following year on her way home with the children. Although ill and going blind, Lee in 1790 accepted the post of James City County sheriff in Virginia, serving two years. He died in 1795 and was buried in Jamestown, Virginia. Personal life William married Hannah Phillipa Ludwell (1739–1784) on March 7, 1769, in London, following the death of her father in the same city. Hannah was the daughter of Col.

Hannah died August 18, 1784 in Ostend, Belgium and was buried in London, England. Frances was the daughter of Hon. Charles Grymes (1693–1743) and Frances Jennings. Charles resided at \\"Morattico\\" in Richmond Co., Virginia. Philip III was the son of Philip Ludwell, Jr. (1672–1726) and Hannah Harrison (1679–1731).

He has worked as a full-time employee of ABC, CBS, National Public Radio, and Pacifica. He has done assignment pieces for ABC's Nightline and World News Tonight, as well as PBS's Frontline, NOVA, and NOW with Bill Moyers. TV Guide called him \\"the most inventive network reporter in television\\", and New York Magazine wrote that he's \\"the man who simplifies without being simple\\". Background Krulwich received his bachelor's degree in U.S. history from Oberlin College in 1969 and his Juris Doctor degree from Columbia Law School in 1974. Just two months later, he abandoned his pursuit of a law career to cover the Watergate hearings for Pacifica Radio. In 1976, he became Washington bureau chief for Rolling Stone. From 1978 to 1985, he was the business and economics correspondent for NPR. Among other creative efforts, he recorded an opera called \\"Rato Interesso\\" to explain interest rates. He went on to host the PBS arts series Edge. In 1984, he joined CBS and appeared regularly on This Morning, 48 Hours, and Nightwatch with Charlie Rose. During the first Gulf War, he co-anchored the CBS program America Tonight. In 1994, he joined ABC. In 1992, Krulwich appeared as a guest on the first episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Annually through the 1990s, he hosted a semi-fictional year-in- review program called Backfire for NPR. In 1995, at the invitation of President and Mrs. Clinton, the group who collaborates with Krulwich to produce Backfire performed at the White House. In 1999 he hosted an eight-part primetime series for ABC Nightline called Brave New World (which frequently featured his friends, They Might Be Giants, as musical guests). Krulwich, in 2004, became the host and managing editor of the innovative PBS science program NOVA scienceNOW. The show often tackled science stories considered too complex for television, sometimes using cartoons and musical production numbers to illustrate abstract concepts. In 2005, Krulwich re-established a relationship with NPR, where he made regular contributions to several programs on science topics, while continuing to produce occasional segments for ABC News. By early 2006, with several projects going at once, Krulwich decided to end his work on NOVA scienceNOW after only five episodes. Krulwich regularly moderates discussions on scientific topics at the 92nd Street Y in New York City. His presentations at the YMHA have featured such prominent scientists as Brian Greene and James D. Watson. He is a regular correspondent on the PBS investigative series Frontline. Krulwich substitutes for the hosts of NPR's magazine shows, and he co-hosts the Radiolab program with Jad Abumrad.  Retirement  On December 5, 2019 Krulwich announced via the Radiolab email newsletter he would be retiring from Radiolab, though specifying it would not be immediate. His last episode aired on January 30, 2020. Awards and honors In his Frontline role, he has won an Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award for his coverage of campaign finance in the 1992 U.S. Presidential campaign; a national Emmy Award for his investigation of privacy on the Internet, High Stakes in Cyberspace; and a George Polk Award for an hour on the savings and loan scandal. His ABC special on Barbie also won an Emmy. He has received a multitude of other awards for his reporting, including the Extraordinary Communicator Award from the National Cancer Institute in 2000, four consecutive Gainsbrugh Awards from the Economics Broadcasting Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science Excellence in Television Award in 2001 for a NOVA special on the human genome.

He was a successful competitor of Bernini. His son, Carlo Rainaldi, became an even more notable, more fully Baroque architect.  Biography  The son of a painter from Norcia, Rainaldi was born in Rome. He trained with the architect-engineer Domenico Fontana and collaborated as a junior partner with Giacomo Della Porta,Cristiano Marchegiani, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani , Enciclopedia Treccani, Volume, 86, 2016, Roma \\"….

Rainaldi's most influential single design was the façade of the Chiesa di Gesù e Maria; the project began in 1642, and was not completed before Rainaldi's death. In his official capacity Rainaldi also designed the palazzo to house the Jesuits in the Piazza del Gesù, a Mannerist façade without a trace of Baroque in its details. As the favored architect of Cardinal Pamphili, he temporarily eclipsed Bernini when this cardinal became Pope as Innocent X in 1644 and he became Papal architect of Rome in 1644.Cristiano Marchegiani, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani , Enciclopedia Treccani, Volume, 86, 2016, (Roma) …Eletto nel 1644, Innocenzo X nominò Girolamo suo architetto… The elder Rainaldi's important projects in Rome the Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona (c. 1645 – 1650), where he designed the ground plan of Sant'Agnese and laid its foundations beginning in 1652, but was replaced the following year by Francesco Borromini, who erected quite a different façade on Rainaldi's foundations; after Rainaldi's death his son Carlo was called in to replace Borromini. He also designed the Tombs in Santa Cecilia in Trastevere and collaborated in the baroque setting of the gardens of Villa Borghese. In Rome, he was appointed Prince of the Academy of St. Luke for the year 1641. The elder Rainaldi was all but house architect for the Farnese family. In the Farnese stronghold of Caprarola, near Rome, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese commissioned Rainaldi to build for the Discalced Carmelites the Church of SS Maria e Silvestro (1621–23), a beautiful and original church adapted to exigencies of the site. Cardinal Odoardo also commissioned the enriched interior of Santa Maria della Consolazione at Caprarola (that is similar to Santa Maria in Campitelli, projected later from his son Carlo Rainaldi). Rainaldi, who had adapted for the Farnese two monumental antique granite basins as matching fountains in Piazza Farnese in 1626, was taken to Parma by the Farnese to build their town palaces there, and also did the vaulting of Santissima Annunziata in that city. Rainaldi was also active in Bologna, where he designed the vaulting to cover the vast and ambitious church of San Petronio (finished on-site by Francesco Martini), and designed the Church of Santa Lucia (1623). For Francesco d'Este, who, with the loss of the Este seat of Ferrara to the Papal States, concentrated his patronage in his Duchy of Modena, Rainaldi contributed to the construction of the Ducal Palace to supplant the ancient castello, and was in particular charged with the layout and elaborate hydraulics of its gardens, with giochi di acque and a theater clipped in green hedges, 1631-34 (Roganti).

She is also known as an English impostor, who claimed the title of Princess Olive of Cumberland. Origins and early career Olive was born Olivia Wilmot, the daughter of Robert Wilmot, a house painter, in Warwick. At the age of ten she was sent to board with her uncle, James Wilmot, rector of Barton-on-the-Heath. In 1789 she rejoined her father in London. She had a talent for painting and studied art with John Thomas Serres, (1759–1825), marine painter to George III, and she married Serres in 1791. They had two daughters. Olive exhibited her paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, but was financially reckless; both she and her husband were imprisoned for debt. The Serres came to a parting of the ways, with acrimony on both sides: from Serres because Olive had had several affairs when he was away, and from Olive because she was given an allowance of only £200 per annum. George Fields, an artist friend, moved in with Olive and she gave birth to his son prior to her divorce in 1804. She then devoted herself to painting and literature, producing a novel, some poems and a memoir of her uncle, the Rev. Dr Wilmot, in which she endeavoured to prove that he was the author of the Letters of Junius. \\"Stone House beneath the Mountains\\" - a painting by Serres Claims to royalty In 1817, Olive wrote a letter to the Prince Regent, claiming that she was the natural daughter of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland by Mrs. Olive Payne (who was James Wilmot's sister and her actual aunt). She asked the prince for financial support. In a petition to George III, she put forward a claim to be the natural daughter of the Duke of Cumberland, the king's brother. In 1820, after her father, her uncle, and King George III had died, she revised her story. James Wilmot, she claimed, had secretly married the princess Poniatowski, sister of King Stanislaus II of Poland, and their daughter had married the Duke of Cumberland in 1767 at the London house of a nobleman. Olive claimed to be the only child of this marriage, and that her mother had died \\"of a broken heart\\" on the Duke of Cumberland's \\"second\\" and \\"bigamous\\" marriage to Anne Horton. She herself, ten days after her birth, was, she alleged, taken from her mother, and substituted for the still-born child of Robert Wilmot. According to Olive Serres, King George III had learned the truth and had given her £5000 in cash and a yearly pension of £500 for life. She also claimed to have received support from the king of Poland and to have been created the Duchess of Lancaster by George III in May 1773, which, she said, entitled her to the income of the Duchy of Lancaster. In a memorial to George IV she assumed the title of Princess Olive of Cumberland, placed the royal arms on her carriage and dressed her servants in the royal liveries. Defending her claims Olivia Serres's claim was supported by documents, and she bore sufficient resemblance to her alleged father to be able to impose on numerous gullible people. In 1821, she had herself rebaptized as the daughter of the Duke of Cumberland at Islington Church, and \\"announced\\" her parentage in several letters to the newspapers and in pamphlets. She actually succeeded in obtaining some courtesies in response to her claims of royal status, such as being permitted to pass through the Constitution Gate. The same year, however, she was arrested again for debt and placed in the King's Bench Prison. She appealed to the public for contributions, placing posters reading \\"The Princess of Cumberland in Captivity!\\" all over London, and publishing, in 1822, further details of her claims. On her release, she had an affair with Sheriff J. W. Parkins, a London eccentric, who turned against her when she failed to honour her debts to him. She next had an affair with a young man who called himself William Henry FitzClarence, who claimed to be an illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence. Olive managed to persuade Sir Gerard Noel, a member of Parliament, to make inquiry into her claims, but by this time the royal family was fighting back. Having located her birth certificate, a statement by Robert Wilmot stating that he was her natural and lawful father, and a statement from Princess Poniatowski that none of King Stanislaus's sisters had ever been to England. In 1823 Sir Robert Peel, then Home Secretary, speaking in parliament, responded to Noel's speech in Olive's favour with a denunciation of her documents as forgeries and her story as a fabrication. It was concluded that her claims were false, but Olive escaped prosecution for forgery. Her husband, who had never given her pretensions any support, expressly denied his belief in them in his will. Olive continued to have economical problems and was for the rest of her life in and out of debtors' prisons. In 1830 she again published a pamphlet staking a claim on royalty. Suppressed book Serres became friendly with Lady Anne Hamilton, who had been lady-in-waiting to Queen Caroline, and gained her confidence. In 1832 Lady Anne wrote a history called \\"The Authentic Records of the Court of England for the Last Seventy Years\\", which contained many accusations of scandals. The publisher, J. Phillips, was prosecuted and convicted but fled into exile.\\"The Living Age\\", Littell, Son & Co., Vol. 151 (1881), p. 818. Serres has been identified as the author of an expanded version of the text which included more scandals, from financial malpractice up to murder; the resulting book was published in two volumes under the title \\"The Secret History of the Court of England\\", but still claiming that Lady Anne Hamilton was the author.K. D. Reynolds, 'Serres , Olivia (1772–1835)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, 2004 , accessed 6 April 2012. Reynolds appears to misdate the book to 1828 in the Oxford DNB entry for Serres; all other sources and his own Oxford DNB entry for Lady Anne Hamilton say 1832. For her part, Lady Anne disclaimed any connection with the two volume publication.Nicholas Tracy, \\"Britannia's Palette: The Arts of Naval Victory\\", McGill-Queen's Press, 2007, p. 243. \\"The Secret History of the Court of England\\" was suppressed in the United Kingdom, a fact noted when it was much reprinted in the United States. Serres died on 21 November 1834 leaving two daughters. Elder daughter Her elder daughter married Antony Ryves, a portrait painter. She upheld her mother's claims and styled herself Princess Lavinia of Cumberland. In 1866 she took her case into court, producing all the documents on which her mother had relied, but the jury, without waiting to hear the conclusion of the reply for the crown, unanimously declared the signatures to be forgeries. Analysis Serres' pretensions have been called the result of an absurd vanity. Between 1807 and 1815 she had made the acquaintance of some members of the Royal family. From this time onward, she is claimed to have been obsessed with the idea of raising herself, at all costs, to their social level. The tale once invented, she brooded so continuously over it that she may have ended by believing it herself.

Concordia College is sponsored by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and is a member of the Concordia University System. It is chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York to offer associate, bachelor, and master's degrees. Concordia, founded in 1881 as Concordia Progymnasium, received its original charter from the State Regents in 1936. From 1918 to 1969, it was named Concordia Collegiate Institute; in 1969, the preparatory school was closed and the present name of the college was authorized by a charter change. In 1972, the State Regents authorized the college to grant the baccalaureate degree. In 2011, the State Regents authorized the college to grant the master's degree. Early history Feth Main Building Concordia College was founded in 1881 in Manhattan as a part of the Lutheran Church of St. Matthew. It was established as a feeder school for Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. Edmund Bohn and J.H. Sieker (director and pastor, respectively, of the Lutheran Church of St. Matthew) established a Sexta and a Quinta (the equivalent to the first two years of high school) at St. Mathew Academy and thereby in effect began a Progymnasium. Concordia soon outgrew its modest beginning and by February 1893, land was purchased in Unionville, New York (now Hawthorne) for $9,000 donated by M. S. Becker. A sub-committee was elected to locate land outside of New York City. Pastor Edmund Bohn, William Dick, and Henry Fischer took a train to the Unionville Station in Westchester County. Property was selected based on the persuasiveness of a real estate agent and a local farmer who claimed that oats, corn, vegetables, and hay could be harvested from the land and that the property contained enough stones to build a foundation. CCNY Hawthorne Building After great consideration (and myriad maintenance issues) the college was moved once again to its current home in Bronxville. were bought for $52,383 on April 23, 1908. The Bronxville property, like the Hawthorn campus, was chosen for its close proximity to Manhattan and for its bucolic backdrop. Three buildings—Feth Hall, Bohm Hall, and the Commons—were designed by Edward Lippincott Tilton and constructed in eight months for $160,000, which included furnishings and landscaping. On January 4, 1910, the Bronxville campus opened with a student body of 100 young men.

Subsequently, the Schoenfeld Memorial Campaign committee was formed and set out to raise $100,000 for construction costs. The Schoenfeld Gymnasium was ultimately erected by the efforts of both the church congregation and The Lutheran Education Society. The gym opened on October 1, 1928. The final cost for the construction project was $140,000. The gymnasium was originally designed by American architect: James Gamble Rogers. The gym was dedicated to William F. Schoenfeld, \\"one of the foremost Lutheran ministers in New York\\". Among many accomplishments associated with the Lutheran Church, Schoenfeld was pastor for 21 years of the Immanuel Church in Manhattan and one of the founders of the Lutheran Education Society. He \\"died suddenly July 30 [1919], on Buck Mountain, near Lake George, N.Y\\". In 1994, three million dollars was raised to convert the Schoenfeld building into a drama facility and center for student life. On September 30, 1995, the building was re-opened to the college community. On October 30, 2015, the new Schoenfeld Campus Center opened. The new modifications included a food court, expanded seating area, an enhanced game room, a redesigned campus store, new study lounges, and a redesigned garden in the outdoor courtyard.

Alta is known for receiving more snow than most Utah resorts, with an average annual snowfall of .ALTA, UTAH – Climate Summary Alta is one of three remaining ski resorts in the U.S. that prohibits snowboarders, along with nearby competitor Deer Valley and Vermont's Mad River Glen. History =Early History= Alta is one of the oldest ski areas in the U.S. and is one of just three ski areas in the U.S. that prohibits snowboarders. Located at the head of Little Cottonwood Canyon in Albion Basin and Collins Gulch, barely from the Great Salt Lake, Alta resides in a unique micro climate characterized by over of high volume, low moisture snowfall annually. Alta Ski Area features long, straight, fall-line pitches. Among the most well known and most favored are Alf's High Rustler, Eddie's High Nowhere, Stone Crusher and the Baldy Chutes. Though widely respected as one of the most challenging of in-bounds ski areas in the world, Alta has always viewed itself as a local's and family oriented ski area. The community of Alta was established in 1871 as an offshoot of the silver mining operations in Little Cottonwood Canyon. A fire destroyed most of the town in 1878, then a cataclysmic avalanche in 1885—combined with the decline of mining—heralded a period of dormancy for the town. The area experienced a modest resurgence in mining in the 1900s, but the town declined again shortly thereafter, and was deserted with the exception of a few hardy miners who continued to intermittently prospect the area. In 1935 the U.S. Forest Service retained the noted skier Alf Engen to hike into the area and determine its potential as a future ski area. Engen's reports expressed great promise for the area, and recommended the purchase of additional surrounding lands to form the ski area. In 1937 a prominent Salt Lake City lawyer, Joe Quinney, along with other local businessmen, formed the Utah Winter Sports Association to oversee the development of skiing at Alta. In the following year construction began on the original Collins chairlift, fashioned from a surplus mining ore tramway system that featured a clamp-cam bullwheel gripping a metal cable strung with single-seat chairs. It was the second such chairlift in the United States, after Sun Valley. Alta opened to skiers for the first time in 1939 on January 15, offering a single ride on the chair for 25 cents. =Recent Developments= Alta installed its first triple in 1991, by upgrading the Germania double chair. The resort began adding a developed snowmaking infrastructure in 1996, and the ski area continues to develop and refine the process. The late 1990s and early 2000s were marked with further modernization. In 1999 the Sunnyside lift was replaced with a detachable triple chair, the resort's first detachable chairlift. Two years later the Supreme chair was upgraded to a triple, and the Sugarloaf chair was replaced with a detachable quad. In the summer of 2004, the Collins double lift and Germania triple lifts were replaced with a single two-stage detachable quad going from the base of the former Collins lift to the top terminal of the former Germania lift. During the 2007–08 season, Alta introduced a new Axess RFID electronic lift ticket system, similar to that of the Solitude Ski Resort. During the 2008–09 season, Alta added a conveyor system at the start point of the Supreme lift that assists skiers in getting on the fixed-triple lift and allows the lift to operate at a faster speed by speeding the loading process. Alta added safety bars to the Sunnyside lift in 2010 and to the Collins, Sugarloaf, and Supreme chairs in the summer of 2011. The most recent lift development was in the 2017–18 season, when Leitner-Poma built a high speed quad that replaced the former Supreme and Cecret lifts, extending from the Sugarloaf base area to the top terminal of the former Supreme lift. = Future Developments = The ski area is in the process of planning for the next several years. Many of the decisions will be made as the Mountain Accord process evolves. This involves a tram to the top of Mt. Baldy, a lift from the Sugar Bowl to Sugarloaf Pass, and improvements to parking.http://mountainaccord.com/ The resort currently has three detachable quad chairs, one detachable triple chair, two double chairs, and three surface tows. The terrain is classified as 15% Beginner, 30% Intermediate, and 55% Advanced. Snowbird ski resort is accessible from Mount Baldy at Alta ski resort On January 15, 2014, a group called Wasatch EqualityWasatch Equality web site and four individual snowboarders filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Alta Ski Area and the United States Forest Service, seeking to permanently disallow Alta from enforcing its anti-snowboarder policy and snowboarding ban. Alta Ski Area prevailed in the ruling and continues to exclusively serve skiers.https://www.law360.com/cases/54770bc7f109b817e30001a2  The Ski Area  The ski area is owned by multiple individuals, with the largest shares being held by the Laughlin family (51%), the Quinney family (25%), and the Bass family (11%). The hotels at the base are all independently owned and not a part of Alta. = Partnership with Snowbird = Beginning in the winter of 2002, Alta and its neighbor, Snowbird, began offering a joint day pass and a joint season ticket, allowing skiers to fully access all of the terrain of both resorts. The offer coincided with the opening of a new lift in Mineral Basin, a large bowl owned by Snowbird on the back of Snowbird's Hidden Peak and Alta's Sugarloaf mountains, that allowed access to Alta from the Basin. Other access points between the two resorts exist as well. (The offer is open to skiers only, as a result of Alta's skiers-only policy; Snowbird allows snowboarders.) =Lifts= Summit of Point SupremeAlta currently has nine lifts. Four are located in Albion Basin, two are located in Collins Gulch, one transfers skiers between the two base areas, and the remaining two access hotels. { ! style=\\"width:20%; background:blue; color:red;\\" Lift Name ! style=\\"width:06%; background:blue; color:white;\\" Length ! style=\\"width:06%; background:blue; color:red;\\" Vertical ! style=\\"width:18%; background:blue; color:white;\\" Type ! style=\\"width:10%; background:blue; color:red;\\" Make ! style=\\"width:20%; background:blue; color:white;\\" Year Installed - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Albion 5,150 ft 867 ft Fixed Double Yan 1976 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Collins 6,296 ft 1,840 ft High Speed Quad Doppelmayr CTEC 2004 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Rustler 475 ft 85 ft Fixed Triple Garaventa CTEC 1999 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Snowpine 487 ft 85 ft Fixed Quad Skytrac 2018 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Sugarloaf 5,042 ft 1,371 ft High Speed Quad Garaventa CTEC 2001 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Sunnyside 4,730 ft 810 ft High Speed Triple Garaventa CTEC 1999 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Supreme 5,134 ft 1,224 ft High Speed Quad Leitner-Poma 2017 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Transfer Tow 2,482 ft 108 ft Platter Yan 1992 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" Wildcat 4,268 ft 1,226 ft Fixed Double Yan 1980 - style=\\"background:#eee; color:black;\\" } =Terrain aspects= * North: 53% * East: 17% * West: 29% * South: 1% Source: References * Shrontz, Duane (1989) Alta: a people's story Alta Ski Lifts Corp * Asmus, Brad (1993) Powder Hound's Guide to Skiing Alta * Engen, Alan (1998) For the Love of Skiing: A Visual History External links * *AltaCam – Alta Skiing Info est. 1996 *Alta Skiing Guide Book – The Powder Hound's Guide to Skiing Alta, a 160-page guide book that describes each of the important runs on one of the most challenging mountains in alpine skiing. *Ski Lifts.org – Alta – current and removed lifts Category:Sports venues in Salt Lake County, Utah Category:Ski areas and resorts in Utah Category:Utah culture Category:Event venues established in 1939 Category:Wasatch Range Category:1939 establishments in Utah ","title":"Alta Ski Area"},{"id":"913999","text":"Kristine Esebua (; born 19 March 1985, Khobi) is a sportsperson from the nation of Georgia.

Lee and Mary Anna Custis Lee. His grandfather George Washington Custis was the step-grandson and adopted son of George Washington and grandson of Martha Custis Washington. He served as a Confederate general in the American Civil War, primarily as an aide-de-camp to President Jefferson Davis, and succeeded his father as president of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.  Early life  George Washington Custis Lee was born in Fort Monroe, Virginia.Heidler's pp. 1151–1152 He was educated at numerous boarding schools to prepare him in his father's footsteps. He was educated at the classical school of Reverend George A. Smith in his younger years. He then entered the mathematical school of Benjamin Hallowell. Lee was not given admission to West Point at 16. Lee's father, Robert E. Lee, then sent a letter to General Winfield Scott on his son's behalf. Zachary Taylor then nominated Lee to West Point.Lee's pp. 497–498 Lee was then accepted to West Point at 17.  West Point and US Army From 1850 to 1854, Lee attended West Point. During his first year, Lee excelled both academically and militarily. Toward the end of his first year he was almost expelled, when alcohol was found in his room. He claimed that he did not put it there, and got away with only minor punishments. He did well in his second year also. At the beginning of his third year, his father became the Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. Lee graduated first in his class of forty-six, in 1854. Other members of his class included J.E.B. Stuart, William Dorsey Pender, John Pegram, James Deshler, Horace Randal, and John Villepigue.McCabe's pg. 2–3 Custis Lee was then commissioned in the Corps of Engineers, as his father before him. He was given the rank of brevet second lieutenant. He served primarily in California, Georgia, and Florida during his time in the United States Army. In 1855, he was given the rank of second lieutenant in the Regular Army. In 1859, Lee was commissioned a first lieutenant. Lee was then stationed in Washington D. C., during the period of secession and Fort Sumter. He then resigned from the Army, in the spring of 1861 after Virginia seceded from the Union. He resigned about two weeks after his father had done the same. Lee then offered his services to his father's Virginia state forces.  American Civil War  Lee in uniform, ca. 1862 Custis Lee served in the Virginia state forces, until July 1861. At that time he was given a commission as a captain in the Confederate States Army. During the next few months, Lee worked in the Confederate Engineers. He spent his time constructing fortifications for the new capital city, Richmond. At the end of August 1861, Lee was offered and accepted the position of aide-de-camp to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He was then promoted to the rank of colonel. Lee served in his position for the next three years of the war. He was often sent on missions to assess the military, and would then return to report to Davis. When Robert E. Lee became the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, Custis Lee had constant contact with his father. In 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign, Custis Lee was put in charge of supervising the engineers at Drewry's Bluff. In June 1863, he was promoted to brigadier general. Lee was discouraged from taking a field command by Davis, but encouraged by his father. Lee asked his father for a field command, but his father replied that his highest duty was obedience to his superiors. For the most part, he obeyed Davis, but during the Battle of Gettysburg, Custis Lee was given the command of the troops in Richmond. In 1864, Custis Lee was placed in command of Richmond's local defenses against General Grant and General Benjamin Butler. He did so well that he was given command of Richmond's eastern defenses at Chaffin's Bluff. Lee remained at Chaffin's Bluff throughout the next months, and in 1864, he was promoted to major general. Shortly before the end of the war, he commanded troops in the field and was captured at Sayler's Creek by David Dunnels White a private in the 37th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment on April 6; three days before his father surrendered on Palm Sunday April 9, 1865 to Lieutenant-General Ulysses S. Grant at the McLean House in the village of Appomattox Court House, Virginia (see: Appomattox Court House National Historical Park).  Later life  Arlington House, ca. 1862 In late 1865, Lee was hired as a professor at the Virginia Military Institute. Lee held this position until the death of his father. Between 1871 and 1897, Lee served as the ninth president of Washington and Lee University. In 1877, seven years after his father's death, Custis Lee sued in a case with assistance from Robert Lincoln that went all the way to the United States Supreme Court to regain title to the family mansion, Arlington House and plantation, which had become Arlington Cemetery. Lee's case, United States v. Lee (106 U.S. 196), was decided in his favor by a 5–4 vote, in 1882. Lee won both the house and the surrounding the mansion. In 1883, Lee sold Arlington House to the United States Government for $150,000.Miller's pg. 125 In 1897, Lee resigned as president of Washington and Lee University. He then moved to the home of his late brother, Major General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee's Ravensworth Mansion. Custis Lee died on February 18, 1913, in Alexandria, Virginia, and is buried in the Lee Chapel, near his family members.Eicher, p. 343. He never married, and had no children.

It first appeared in print in 1881, but it is reported that a version was already being sung to the current tune in the 1790s and similar rhymes are known from across Europe. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7925. Lyrics L. Leslie Brooke's Ring O' Roses (1922) shows nursery rhyme characters performing the game It is unknown what the earliest version of the rhyme was or when it began. Many incarnations of the game have a group of children form a ring, dance in a circle around a person, and stoop or curtsy with the final line. The slowest child to do so is faced with a penalty or becomes the \\"rosie\\" (literally: rose tree, from the French rosier) and takes their place in the center of the ring. Variations, corruptions, and vulgarized versions were noted to be in use long before the earliest printed publications. One such variation was dated to be in use in Connecticut in the 1840s. Common British versions include: > Ring-a-ring o' roses, A pocket full of posies, A-tishoo! A-tishoo! We all > fall down.Delamar (2001), pp. 38-9. Common American versions include: > Ring-a-round the rosie, A pocket full of posies, Ashes! Ashes! We all fall > down. Children's Dances by Hans Thoma. Common Indian versions include: > Ringa ringa roses, Pocket full of posies Husha busha! We all fall down! Common Maori versions include: > Ring-a-round the roses, A pocket full of posies, Kohuru! Kohuru! We all fall > down. The last two lines are sometimes varied to: > Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! We've all tumbled down. =Early attestation= Kate Greenaway's illustration from Mother Goose or the Old Nursery Rhymes (1881), showing children playing the game A reference to a young children's game named Ring o' Roses occurs in an 1846 article from the Brooklyn Eagle. A group of young children (the eldest being about seven) form a ring, from which a boy takes out a girl and kisses her. An early version of the rhyme occurs in a novel of 1855, The Old Homestead by Ann S. Stephens: > A ring – a ring of roses, Laps full of posies; Awake – awake! Now come and > make A ring – a ring of roses. The novel goes on to describe a nineteenth-century Fourth of July celebration by children housed in a hospital in Roosevelt Island, New York (then known as \\"Blackwell's Island\\"): \\"Then the little girls began to seek their own amusements. They played 'hide and seek', 'ring, ring a rosy', and a thousand wild and pretty games\\".Stephens, op. cit, pp. 215–216 Another early printing of the rhyme was in Kate Greenaway's 1881 edition of Mother Goose; or, the Old Nursery Rhymes: > Ring-a-ring-a-roses, A pocket full of posies; Hush! hush! hush! hush! We're > all tumbled down. In 1882, Godey's Lady's Book has the following version: > Ring around a rosy Pocket full of posies. One, two, three—squat! Before the last line, the children stop suddenly, then exclaim it together, \\"suiting the action to the word with unfailing hilarity and complete satisfaction\\". In his Games and Songs of American Children (1883), William Wells Newell reports several variants, one of which he provides with a melody and dates to New Bedford, Massachusetts around 1790: > Ring a ring a Rosie, A bottle full of posie, All the girls in our town Ring > for little Josie. Newell writes that \\"[a]t the end of the words the children suddenly stoop, and the last to get down undergoes some penalty, or has to take the place of the child in the centre, who represents the 'rosie' (rose-tree; French, rosier).\\" An 1883 collection of Shropshire folk-lore includes the following version: > A ring, a ring o' roses, A pocket-full o' posies; One for Jack and one for > Jim and one for little Moses! A-tisha! a-tisha! a-tisha! On the last line \\"they stand and imitate sneezing\\". A manuscript of rhymes collected in Lancashire at the same period gives three closely related versions, with the now familiar sneezing, for instance: > A ring, a ring o' roses, A pocket full o' posies – Atishoo atishoo we all > fall down.Opie and Opie (1985), p. 222. In 1892, folklorist Alice Gomme could give twelve versions.Opie and Opie (1951), p. 364. =European variants= Illustration by Jessie Willcox Smith, from The Little Mother Goose (1912) A German rhyme first printed in 1796 closely resembles \\"Ring a ring o' roses\\" in its first stanzaThe one commonly sung according to Böhme (1897), p. 438. and accompanies the same actions (with sitting rather than falling as the concluding action):Böhme (1897), p. 438, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 225. > Ringel ringel reihen, Wir sind der Kinder dreien, Sitzen unter'm Hollerbusch > Und machen alle Husch husch husch! Loosely translated this says \\"Round about in rings / We children three/ Sit beneath an elderbush / And 'Shoo, shoo, shoo' go we!\\" The rhyme (as in the popular collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn) is well known in Germany and has many local variants.Böhme (1897), pp. 438–41, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227. Other rhymes for the same game have some similarity in the first line, e.g. \\"Ringel, ringel, Rosenkranz\\", less in other linessee Böhme (1897), 442–5. Another version runs > Ringel, Ringel, Rosen, Schöne Aprikosen, Veilchen blau, Vergissmeinnicht, > Alle Kinder setzen sich!\\"Deutsches Kinderlied und Kinderspiel. In Kassel aus > Kindermund in Wort und Weise gesammelt von Johann Lewalter\\" (Kassel 1911), I > Nr. 12. Hermann Dunger, \\"Kinderlieder und Kinderspiele aus dem Vogtlande\\" > (Plauen 1874), p. 320. Böhme (1897) \\\\- \\"A ring, a ring o' roses,/ Lovely apricots,/ Violets blue, forget-me-nots,/ Sit down, children all!\\" Swiss versions have the children dancing round a rosebush.Böhme (1897), p. 439, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 225. Other European singing games with a strong resemblance include \\"Roze, roze, meie\\" (\\"Rose, rose, May\\") from The Netherlands with a similar tune to \\"Ring a ring o' roses\\"Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227. and \\"Gira, gira rosa\\" (\\"Circle, circle, rose\\"), recorded in Venice in 1874, in which girls danced around the girl in the middle who skipped and curtsied as demanded by the verses and at the end kissed the one she liked best, so choosing her for the middle.Opie and Opie (1985), p. 224. Meaning Illustration by L. Leslie Brooke (1862–1940) for \\"All Tumble Down\\" from Anon, Ring O' Roses (1922) The origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation. Folklore scholars, however, regard the Great Plague explanation that has been the most common since the mid-20th century as baseless. =Theories from the late 19th century= In 1898, A Dictionary of British Folklore contained the belief that an explanation of the game was of pagan origin, based on the Sheffield Glossary comparison of Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie. The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states, \\"Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Freyja wept gold.\\" It claimed the first instance to be indicative of pagan beings of light. Another suggestion is more literal, that it was making a \\"ring\\" around the roses and bowing with the \\"all fall down\\" as a curtsy. In 1892, the American writer, Eugene Field wrote a poem titled Teeny-Weeny that specifically referred to fey folk playing ring-a-rosie. According to Games and Songs of American Children, published in 1883, the \\"rosie\\" was a reference to the French word for rose tree and the children would dance and stoop to the person in the center. Variations, especially more literal ones, were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game-rhyme. Again in 1898, sneezing was then noted to be indicative of many superstitious and supernatural beliefs across differing cultures. =The Great Plague explanation of the mid-20th century= Since after the Second World War, the rhyme has often been associated with the Great Plague which happened in England in 1665, or with earlier outbreaks of the Black Death in England. Interpreters of the rhyme before World War II make no mention of this;Opie and Opie (1985), pp. 221–222. by 1951, however, it seems to have become well established as an explanation for the form of the rhyme that had become standard in the United Kingdom. Peter and Iona Opie, the leading authorities on nursery rhymes, remarked: The line Ashes, Ashes in colonial versions of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or blackening of their skin, and the theory has been adapted to be applied to other versions of the rhyme. In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague.Opie and Opie (1985), p. 221, citing the use of the rhyme to headline an article on the plague village of Eyam in the Radio Times, 7 June 1973; title of \\"Ashes\\" in the New Scientist review. In 1949, a parodist composed a version alluding to radiation sickness: In March 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the traditional rhyme was jokingly proposed as the \\"ideal choice\\" of song to accompany hand-washing in order to ward off infection. Counterarguments Folklore scholars regard the Great Plague explanation of the rhyme as baseless for several reasons: *The plague explanation did not appear until the mid-twentieth century. *The symptoms described do not fit especially well with the Great Plague.J. Simpson and S. Roud, A Dictionary of English Folklore (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 296. *The great variety of forms makes it unlikely that the modern form is the most ancient one, and the words on which the interpretation are based are not found in many of the earliest records of the rhyme (see above).Opie and Opie (1985), pp. 222–223: \\"The following are the seven earliest reports known from in Britain ... In only four of these recordings is sneezing a feature\\". The point becomes stronger when American versions are also taken into account. *European and 19th-century versions of the rhyme suggest that this \\"fall\\" was not a literal falling down, but a curtsy or other form of bending movement that was common in other dramatic singing games.See above, and Opie and Opie (1951), p. 365, citing Chants Populaire du Languedoc: \\"Branle, calandre, La Fille d'Alexandre, La pêche bien mûre, Le rosier tout fleuri, Coucou toupiEn disant 'coucou toupi', tous les enfants quie forment la ronde, s'accroupissent\\", roughly translated: \\"The peach well ripe, the rose all blooming, cuckoo humming – When 'cuckoo humming' is said, all the children forming the circle crouch down\\".

Formed in 1989, the band moved through several musical incarnations despite maintaining a relatively stable line-up. While their early records moved through heavy metal into dark indie rock, their recent efforts for which they have received the most attention have been strongly influenced by the electronica scene, along with the other groups on the record label Morr Music.  History  The Acher brothers and Messerschmid formed the group in 1989 in Weilheim in Oberbayern, near Munich. In 1990 they recorded their self-titled debut, a grunge-metal oriented LP. 1992 saw the release of Nook, which has an indie rock sound, while their 1995 album 12 contains their first flirtation with electronics. Martin Gretschmann then joined the group in 1997. Shrink, released in 1998, is a jazz-electro-rock album. In 1998 Cynthia Dall did the vocals for a remix of \\"Torture Day\\" by The Notwist. The album Neon Golden (released in 2002) put them on the map for American listeners, with its heartfelt sentiment and more pop-oriented sound. Messerschmidt left the group in 2007 and was replaced by Andi Haberl. The band's sixth full-length record, The Devil, You + Me, was released in Europe in May 2008.Thiessen, Brock.\\"The Demonic Minds of the Notwist\\", Exclaim!, July 2008.

MacLean. MacLean originally formulated his model in the 1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990 book The Triune Brain in Evolution. The triune brain consists of the reptilian complex, the paleomammalian complex (limbic system), and the neomammalian complex (neocortex), viewed each as independently conscious, and as structures sequentially added to the forebrain in the course of evolution. However, this hypothesis has been subject to criticism, and is no longer espoused by the majority of comparative neuroscientists in the post-2000 era.Kiverstein, J., & Miller, M. (2015). The embodied brain: towards a radical embodied cognitive neuroscience. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 9, 237. http://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00237 The triune brain hypothesis became familiar to a broad popular audience through Carl Sagan's Pulitzer prize winning 1977 book The Dragons of Eden. The theory has been embraced by some psychiatrists and at least one leading affective neuroscience researcher.Panksepp, J. (2003). Foreword to Cory, G. and Gardner, R. (2002) The Evolutionary Neuroethology of Paul MacLean: Convergences and Frontiers. Since the 1970s in some circles of evolutionary and developmental neuroscience the concept of the triune brain has been regarded as a myth.  Reptilian complex  The reptilian complex (also known as the \\"R-complex\\", \\"reptilian brain\\" or \\"lizard brain\\") was the name MacLean gave to the basal ganglia, structures derived from the floor of the forebrain during development. The term derives from the idea that comparative neuroanatomists once believed that the forebrains of reptiles and birds were dominated by these structures. MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species- typical instinctual behaviours involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays.  Paleomammalian complex  The paleomammalian brain consists of the septum, amygdalae, hypothalamus, hippocampal complex, and cingulate cortex. MacLean first introduced the term \\"limbic system\\" to refer to this set of interconnected brain structures in a paper in 1952. MacLean's recognition of the limbic system as a major functional system in the brain was widely accepted among neuroscientists, and is generally regarded as his most important contribution to the field. MacLean maintained that the structures of the limbic system arose early in mammalian evolution (hence \\"paleomammalian\\") and were responsible for the motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behaviour, and parental behaviour.  Neomammalian complex  The neomammalian complex consists of the cerebral neocortex, a structure found uniquely in higher mammals, and especially humans. MacLean regarded its addition as the most recent step in the evolution of the mammalian brain, conferring the ability for language, abstraction, planning, and perception.  Status of the model  MacLean originally formulated the triune brain hypothesis in the 1960s, drawing on comparative neuroanatomical work done by Ludwig Edinger, Elizabeth C. Crosby and Charles Judson Herrick early in the twentieth century.Striedter, G. F. (2005) Principles of Brain Evolution. Sinauer Associates. The 1980s saw a rebirth of interest in comparative neuroanatomy, motivated in part by the availability of a variety of new neuroanatomical techniques for charting the circuitry of animal brains. Subsequent findings have refined the traditional neuroanatomical ideas upon which MacLean based his hypothesis. For example, the basal ganglia (structures derived from the floor of the forebrain and making up MacLean's reptilian complex) were shown to take up a much smaller portion of the forebrains of reptiles and birds (together called sauropsids) than previously supposed, and to exist in amphibians and fish as well as mammals and sauropsids. Because the basal ganglia are found in the forebrains of all modern vertebrates, they most likely date to the common evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates, more than 500 million years ago, rather than to the origin of reptiles. Some recent behavioral studies do not support the traditional view of sauropsid behavior as stereotyped and ritualistic (as in MacLean's reptilian complex). Birds have been shown to possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as the toolmaking of the New Caledonian crow and the language-like categorization abilities of the grey parrot. Structures of the limbic system, which MacLean proposed arose in early mammals, have now been shown to exist across a range of modern vertebrates. The \\"paleomammalian\\" trait of parental care of offspring is widespread in birds and occurs in some fishes as well. Thus, like the basal ganglia, the evolution of these systems presumably dates to a common vertebrate ancestor.Butler, A. B. and Hodos, W. Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, Wiley Finally, recent studies based on paleontological data or comparative anatomical evidence strongly suggest that the neocortex was already present in the earliest emerging mammals. In addition, although non-mammals do not have a neocortex in the true sense (that is, a structure comprising part of the forebrain roof, or pallium, consisting of six characteristic layers of neurons), they possess pallial regions, and some parts of the pallium are considered homologous to the mammalian neocortex. While these areas lack the characteristic six neocortical layers, birds and reptiles generally possess three layers in the dorsal pallium (the homolog of the mammalian neocortex). The telencephalon of birds and mammals makes neuroanatomical connections with other telecencephalic structures like those made by neocortex. It mediates similar functions such as perception, learning and memory, decision making, motor control, conceptual thinking.  Lay interest  The triune model of the mammalian brain is seen as an oversimplified organizing theme by some in the field of comparative neuroscience. It continues to hold public interest because of its simplicity. While inaccurate in many respects as an explanation for brain activity, structure and evolution, it remains one of very few approximations of the truth we have to work with: the \\"neocortex\\" represents that cluster of brain structures involved in advanced cognition, including planning, modeling and simulation; the \\"limbic brain\\" refers to those brain structures, wherever located, associated with social and nurturing behaviors, mutual reciprocity, and other behaviors and affects that arose during the age of the mammals; and the \\"reptilian brain\\" refers to those brain structures related to territoriality, ritual behavior and other \\"reptile\\" behaviors. The simple explanatory value makes this approximation engaging and may be a useful level of complexity for high-school students to begin engaging with brain research. Howard Bloom, in his book The Lucifer Principle, references the concept of the triune brain in his explanations of certain aspects of human behavior. Arthur Koestler made MacLean's concept of the triune brain the centerpiece of much of his later work, notably The Ghost in the Machine. English novelist Julian Barnes quotes MacLean on the triune brain in the foreword to his 1982 novel Before She Met Me. Peter A. Levine uses the triune brain concept in his book Waking the Tiger to explain his somatic experiencing approach to healing trauma. Glynda-Lee Hoffmann, in her book The Secret Dowry of Eve, Women's Role in the Development of Consciousness, references the triune theory explored by MacLean and goes one step further. Her theory about human behavior, and the problems we create with that behavior, distinguishes the prefrontal cortex as uniquely different from the rest of the neocortex. The prefrontal cortex, with its agenda of integration, is the part of the brain that can get the other parts to work together for the good of the individual. In many humans the reptilian cortex (agenda: territory and reproduction [in humans that translates to power and sex]) is out of control and the amygdala stokes the fear that leads to more bad behavior. The prefrontal cortex is the key to our future if we can harness its power.Glynda-Lee Hoffmann, \\"The Secret Dowry of Eve 2003\\", .

The series is a sequel to Miller's 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns. It tells the story of an aged Bruce Wayne who returns from three years in hiding, training his followers and instigating a rebellion against Lex Luthor's dictatorial rule over the United States. The series features an ensemble cast of superheroes including Catgirl, Superman, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man, The Flash, and the Atom.  Overview  The series was originally published as a three-issue limited series published by DC Comics between November 2001 and July 2002. It has since been published as hardcover and paperback one-volume editions and as the Absolute Dark Knight edition with The Dark Knight Returns. Like its predecessor, this story takes place in a timeline that is not considered canonical in the current DC Comics continuity. Synopsis Frank Miller's cover to The Dark Knight Strikes Again #1. After going underground, Batman (Bruce Wayne) and his young sidekick Catgirl (formerly Carrie KelleyRobin) train an army of \\"Batboys\\" (the former Mutants and other recruits) to save the world from a police dictatorship led by Lex Luthor. In a series of raids on government facilities, Batman's soldiers release other superheroesincluding Atom, Flash and Plastic Manfrom captivity. Elongated Man is recruited and Green Arrow is already working with Batman. Superman, Wonder Woman, and Captain Marvel have been forced to work for the US government, as their loved ones are being held hostage. Superman is ordered by \\"President Rickard\\" (a computer-generated front for Lex Luthor and Brainiac) to stop Batman. He confronts Wayne at the Batcave, but Batman and the other superheroes defeat him. Meanwhile, Batman's raids have been noticed by the media. After being banned for years, the freed superheroes have recaptured the public imagination and have become a fad among the youth. At a pop concert by \\"The Superchix\\", Batman and the other heroes make a public appearance urging their fans to rebel against the oppressive government. During this time, rogue vigilante Question spies on Luthor's plans and types a journal to record the misdeeds of those in power. Question tries to convince the Martian Manhunternow an aged, bitter, near-powerless figure with his mind filled with Luthor's nanotechnologyto stand up against Superman and the government. Question and Martian Manhunter are attacked by a mysterious man resembling the Joker, who is seemingly invulnerable to injury. Martian Manhunter sacrifices his life and Question is rescued by Green Arrow. The mysterious man escapes to kill other superheroes including Guardian and Creeper, stealing their costumes and wearing them. An extraterrestrial monster lands in Metropolis and begins to destroy the city. Batman is convinced that it is an attempt to lure him and his allies out of hiding and does not respond, dismissing Flash's appeal that they are supposed to save lives. Batman's opinion is that it is too risky to save the lives of the populace. Superman and Captain Marvel fight the monster, which is revealed to be Brainiac, who coerces Superman into defeat using the bottled Kryptonian city of Kandor as leverage, to crush the people's faith in superheroes. Captain Marvel is killed defending citizens from the carnage but Superman is saved when his daughter Lara appears. She has been carefully hidden since birth, but, now that the government knows she exists, they demand that she be handed over. Deciding that Batman and his methods are the only way, Superman, Wonder Woman and Lara join him. Lara pretends to hand herself over to Brainiac. Atom slips into the bottle and frees the Kandorians, who use their combined heat vision to destroy Brainiac. The superheroes then destroy the dictatorship's power source and incite a revolution. Batman allows himself to be captured and tortured by Luthor to learn his plans. Luthor has launched satellites to destroy most of the world's population, leaving him with a more manageable number of people. The Green Lantern, who has turned into pure will, returns from space and destroys Luthor's satellites. Luthor is in turn killed by the son of Hawkman and Hawkgirl (Shayera Hol). Returning to the Batcave, Batman is contacted by Carrie, who is being attacked by the Joker-like man and now wearing a Robin costume. Batman arrives and recognizes the man as Dick Grayson, the first Robin who Batman fired long ago. Grayson has been genetically altered to have a powerful healing factor and shape-shifting ability, but is criminally insane. As Batman and Grayson contemptuously recall their bleak history together, Batman drops him through a trapdoor into a miles-deep crevasse filled with lava, while Elongated Man rescues Carrie. Grayson clings onto a ledge, climbs out of the chasm and faces Batman. When Grayson remains virtually unharmed by everything Batman throws at him, Batman hurls himself and Grayson into the chasm. Grayson falls into the lava and is disintegrated. Superman rescues Batman at the last minute as the Batcave explodes, and takes him to Carrie in the Batmobile. Background and creation In 2006, Frank Miller said of the creation process for The Dark Knight Strikes Again: Characters * BatmanBruce Wayne's alter ego who is 58 years old and faked his death three years ago and continues to operate secretly as Batman in 1989. He leads a rebellion against the corrupt U.S. government headed by Lex Luthor. Batman is a skilled and controversial strategist who makes decisions which result in deaths, which he considers necessary for the defeat of his enemies. * CatgirlCarrie Kelley, formerly Robin, is Batman's second-in-command. * Lex LuthorLuthor heads the U.S. government and uses a hologram of what the people think is the President as a figurehead. He controls powerful superheroesincluding Superman, Captain Marvel and Wonder Womanby holding their loved ones hostage. * Brainiacprovides Luthor with the means to control the U.S., and hence the world. * Supermancontrolled by Luthor, who is holding the miniaturized city of Kandor hostage. Encouraged by his daughter and Batman, Superman finally fights back and breaks his own vow not to kill. * Wonder Womanthe youthful Queen of the Amazons who has a daughter with Superman. * LaraThe daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman who has the powers of a Kryptonian and the warrior attitude of an Amazon. She has a poor opinion of people less powerful than herself and tries to persuade Superman to rise above the humans and possibly take over the world. * Captain Marvelnow an old man, he still stands by Superman and Wonder Woman. Captain Marvel is limited in his abilities because Luthor holds his sister Mary hostage. He reveals that he and Billy Batson were two separate beings who switched places, and that Billy (who had always been sickly) had died around 8 years ago. This rendered him incapable of just switching out to recuperate because there would be no one to call him back * \\"The Joker\\"/Dick GraysonHaving been emotionally abused by Batman and sacked years before for \\"cowardice and incompetence\\", Grayson has submitted himself to radical gene therapy by Luthor and other villains. He has gained a powerful healing factor and shape-shifting ability, but was driven criminally insane. Throughout most of the story, Grayson takes on the appearance of the Joker and the costumes of members of the Legion of Super-Heroes. His victims include Martian Manhunter, Creeper, the Guardian, and he almost kills Carrie Kelley. * Atomtrapped inside a Petri dish for over two years, Ray Palmer is rescued by Carrie Kelley and becomes one of the first of the old superheroes to join Batman's rebellion. * The Flashcoerced by threats to his wife Iris, Barry Allen is forced to run in a giant electrical generator before being freed by Carrie Kelley and the Atom. * Elongated ManRalph Dibny advertises sex drugs on television before joining Batman. * Plastic Maninsane and rescued from Arkham Asylum, Eel O'Brian joins Batman's group. * The Superchixan all-girl pop/superhero group consisting of a Black Canary lookalike, Bat Chick and Wonder Chick. * Green Arrowa communist, activist and billionaire with a mechanical arm, Oliver Queen has long been part of Batman's forces. * The Questionfighting for Batman's cause, Vic Sage works mainly alone and tries to recruit the former Martian Manhunter. He spies on Luthor and his associates, and distrusts technology and municipalization. * Martian Manhuntera victim of Luthor's nanobots, which have deprived him of most of his powers, J'onn J'onzz has become addicted to alcohol and tobacco. He retains a precognitive sense which he uses to help Question. * Green LanternHal Jordan now lives with his own alien family in a distant part of the galaxy. He returns to Earth at Batman's request. * HawkboyHawkman and Hawkgirl's son who grew up with his sister in the Costa Rican rainforest. When their parents are killed by a military strike ordered by Luthor, Hawkboy intends to take revenge. * Saturn Girla young, thirteen-year-old who can see into the future. She adopts the name and outfit of the 31st-century Legionnaire. * Rick Rickardthe holographic puppet President of the United States. * U.S. Secretary of State Ruger, Exxon and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Starbucksmembers of Luthor's government. * Hawk and DoveHank and Don Hall are in their old age.

Critical reception and sales The Dark Knight Strikes Again received mixed to negative reviews, with criticism focusing on its artwork, storyline, and character development. Claude Lalumière of The Montreal Gazette gave the series a mixed review and said \\"the script lacks the emotional nuances of its predecessor, and ... the artwork is rushed and garish\\", and that it \\"has considerable chutzpah, but its careless execution is regrettable\\". Roger Sabin of The Guardian wrote that the series has \\"flashes of brilliancefew can control page layouts like Millerbut in general the idea of the ironic superhero seems rather dated.\\" The first issue of \\"DK2\\" ranked #1 in December 2001 with pre-order sales at 174,339. The second issue of DK2 was ranked third in sales for the January 2002 period with pre-order sales of 155,322. The final issue of the series had pre-order sales of 171,546 returning to #1 for the month of February 2002. The comic had an in-store date on July 31 of that same year.https://web.archive.org/web/20020617192723/http://www1.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this;_cat=Comics&action;=page&type;_id=&cat;_id=270363&obj;_id=34913 Discussing the negative reception for The Dark Knight Strikes Again, Frank Miller said in 2006: \\"I expected shock. I wanted it. I never make it my mission to reassure people. Time will make its own judgement.\\" Sequel On April 24, 2015, DC Comics announced that Frank Miller was co-writing a sequel to The Dark Knight Strikes Again with Brian Azzarello titled The Dark Knight III: The Master Race. The series featured a rotating cast of artists, including Andy Kubert and Klaus Janson. Frank Miller later confirmed that The Master Race would not be the conclusion, and he was beginning work on a fourth series.

It is now adjacent to the campus of Southern Maine Community College. History The lighthouse was constructed in 1897 by the government after seven steamship companies stated that many of their vessels ran aground on Spring Point Ledge. Congress initially allocated $20,000 to its construction, although the total cost of the tower ended up being $45,000 due to problems with storms and poor quality cement. The lighthouse featured a fog bell that sounded twice every 12 seconds, and a lantern fitted with a fifth order Fresnel lens first lit by Keeper William A. Lane on May 24, 1897. Improvements were made to the lighthouse throughout the 20th century. It was electrified in 1934, and in 1951, a 900-foot breakwater made from of granite was constructed in order to connect the lighthouse to the mainland. The lighthouse was originally owned and operated by the United States Coast Guard. However, on April 28, 1998, the Maine Lights Selection Committee approved a transfer of ownership of the tower to the Spring Point Ledge Light Trust, with the USCG retaining only the light and fog signal. On May 22, 1999, Spring Point Ledge Light was opened to the public for the first time in its history. It is a popular spot on any summer day for families to picnic and boat-watch on the breakwater or for fisherman to spend an afternoon catching fish. Adjacent to the lighthouse, visitors may also tour the old Fort Preble, the Southern Maine Community College Campus, and visit a small gift shop. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Spring Point Ledge Light Station on January 21, 1988.

History First airing in January 2002, and originally called Now with Bill Moyers, the program was launched as a collaboration between NPR news and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The program featured documentary reporting, interviews and commentary on current events. Bill Moyers served initially as sole host of the program while NPR reporters and commentators produced individual segments for the hour long- program. In the autumn of 2003, David Brancaccio was introduced as a co-host. In 2004, Kenneth Tomlinson, the Chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, paid an outside consultant $14,000 to watch NOW with Bill Moyers and analyze the politics of the show. The study was not approved by the CPB. After the study became public in 2005, the CPB-funded NPR, among other organizations, criticized the resulting study as being full of errors and a waste of money. In the summer of 2004 the Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced that it would no longer provide funding for Now. Moyers subsequently announced that he would leave the show after the 2004 U.S. elections and appeared for the last time on December 17, 2004. After his departure, the show was reduced to a half hour. Maria Hinojosa was credited as a senior correspondent for the show while presenting many investigative pieces. She and Brancaccio were the only two presenters and usually alternated segments.

After its completion in 1910, it was considered to be one of the most complete athletic facilities in the Eastern United States. The gymnasium contains two swimming pools, intramural basketball courts, championship basketball courts, two weight rooms, squash courts, 1/13 of a mile jogging track, two saunas, fencing lanes, and a rowing tank for crew training. The Fitness Center as viewed from the mezzanine Alumni Gymnasium was designed by Charles Rich and Fredrick Mathesius. Construction began in 1909 under College President Ernest Fox Nichols. The cornerstone of the gymnasium contains several historical objects, including a file of the \\"New Gymnasium News\\", copies of the student newspaper The Dartmouth, the Dartmouth humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, and the yearbook, the Aegis. The building cost approximately $190,000. In 1939, engineers from the Thayer School of Engineering constructed a springy board track of Canadian spruce around the inside of the gym which was used by Glenn Cunningham to break the American mile record that year. During World War I, the gymnasium was converted into barracks, and during World War II, was used as an armory and lounge. In 1962-1963 the gym was extensively remodeled to include a new basketball court and added to the Dartmouth College aquatic facilities with the addition of the Karl B. Michael Pool. In 1972, the year the college went coed, a two-story women's locker room was added to the southeast corner. Basketball courts and the indoor track Alumni Gymnasium completed a $12 million renovation in the spring of 2006. As part of the renovation efforts, Alumni Gym now features a fitness center built into the second floor, 8 new multi-purpose fitness rooms that together add roughly of new usable space, structural enhancements to the Karl Michael Pool, new entrances, an elevator servicing all floors of the gym, and handicap accessible upgrades.

The sole outlet to the Leech Lake River is controlled by a dam in order to regulate water levels of the lake. Leech Lake has seven major inlets that include Portage Lake Creek, Sucker Creek, Steamboat River, Benedict River, Shingobee River, Bishop Creek, and the Boy River. There are also nine minor inlets that flow into Leech Lake. The larger east portion of Leech Lake, as seen from The Narrows =Islands= Leech Lake hosts eleven islands that cover a total of 1,617 acres of land.

Shingobee Bay, and the adjacent Walker Bay, boast some of the deepest parts in the entire lake. Ecology =Invasive species= * Lythrum salicaria Also known as purple loosestrife. This is an invasive plant that takes over lake shores and marshes, replacing cattails and other native wetland plants. Purple loosestrife doesn't provide a sufficient food source, nesting area, or cover for the native animals. Also one plant can produce around two million seeds annually, and it spreads rapidly through aquatic systems. * Typha angustifolia Better known as the narrow-leaf cattail, this invasive plant is able to grow in deeper water (compared to its native counterparts). The narrow-leaf cattail competes with the native Typha latifolia (broad leaf cattail) and other native plants along Leech Lake. =Aquatic life= Leech Lake is a popular sport fishing hotspot, and is fished for many different types.

History Ojibwa women in canoe, Leech Lake On early maps, Leech Lake is identified in French as \\"lac Sangsue\\" (Bloodsucker Lake), which was then translated into English to its current name; its French name was translated from the Ojibwe \\"Ozagaskwaajimekaag- zaaga'igan\\" (lake abundant with bloodsuckers). In 1855, the Leech Lake Indian Reservation was established on the south shore of Leech Lake, along with two other Indian Reservations in the area, which along with two additional Indian Reservations, the five Indian Reservations were amalgamated in 1936 to form the current \\"Greater\\" Leech Lake Indian Reservation which encompasses most all of Leech Lake. On October 5, 1898, Leech Lake was the location of a conflict between Ojibwe and Federal troops of the United States, the Battle of Sugar Point. A firefight broke out between the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe after one of the soldiers sent to retrieve a bootlegger mistakenly fired his rifle. Oscar Burkard received the Medal of Honor on August 21, 1899 for his participation in the battle. Economy =Recreational/leisure use= Every February, Leech Lake is home to the International Eelpout Festival. The eel pout, also known as the Burbot, is rarely seen in Leech Lake, except in the winter when it is very plentiful.

Virtual office services started in the 1960s as serviced offices and have evolved with technology to include a wide variety of personnel, physical space, digital storage and communication services. Customers pay a contract fee for these services which may be offered à la carte, as packages or membership subscription. The concept is popular with companies of all sizes, including self-employed entrepreneurs. One of the primary allures of the virtual office is the flexibility it offers for employees and freelancers to work from a satellite office, home office, remote location or even on-the-go via a mobile device. At the same time, a company can offer its clients and employees a stable home office with access to amenities such as receptionist, conference rooms, desk space, mailboxes, printing and faxing at a permanent address, which are owned and maintained by the virtual office provider or a third party. Virtual office providers may also include digital capital such as cloud storage, web hosting, email and other web-based applications.  History  The concept of a virtual office has roots before and during the Industrial Revolution, where parallels to current work styles, specifically working from home, have been drawn. The virtual office concept is an evolution of the traditional executive suite. As an executive suite lease became increasingly impractical for certain types and stages of business, it naturally opened the door to a virtual office concept.MacDonald, Peter; \\"Future Office 'Virtually' Here\\". BCBR May 1996, Vol. 15, Issue #5 In the mid-20th century, professionals and executives began to examine ways to make more efficient use of the rising cost of real estate, personnel and other capital. Below are some milestones in the resulting evolution of the virtual office, along with the advent of technologies that help shape the industry. ;1962:The first known serviced office company, OmniOffices Group, was created. ;1966:Serviced offices and executive suites were rented by Fegen Law Suites. This included large blocks of office space with furnished suites, reception services, telephone answering, photocopies, conference rooms, and a law library. ;1972:ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet, went public by connecting 40 computers in different locations. ;1973:Attorney Office Management, Inc. developed an “off-site” program in response to lawyers wanting to partially retire. Instead of a full executive suite, Attorneys could work from home while continuing a part-time presence through AOMI's Beverly Hills location. : Jack Nilles coined the terms \\"telecommuting\\" and \\"telework.\\" ;1974:Scientists with the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers developed transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP), which allows different networks to communicate with each other. ;1978:Alf Moufarrige founded Servcorp in Sydney, Australia. In order to reduce his overhead, he began sharing his premium office space, receptionist and clerical staff with other growing businesses. Servcorp took its virtual office concept international in 1980 and in 1999 became a publicly traded company. ;1981:Released April 1, The Osborne 1 became the first successful portable computer, designed by Adam Osborne. Although it still required a power source, it was considered portable as it could easily be transported. This was a first step in allowing professionals to work away from the office. ;1982:ARPANET adopted TCP/IP, giving birth to the Internet. : The term “virtual office” was used by John Markoff in an article published by InfoWorld magazine. Markoff wrote, “In the future virtual office, workers will no longer be constrained by computer equipment or geographic location, according to this vision. They will be free to travel or to interact with others while communicating information freely. The office as we know it will cease to have the central importance it does today.” ;1983:Chris Kern coined the term ‘virtual office’ in his column for the September, 1983 issue of the American Way magazine. Kern used the term to describe the possibility of ‘doing business while on the go’ thanks to portable computers. ;1984:The first personal digital assistant (PDA), the Organizer, was released by Psion. ;1989:Timothy John Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web, considered as being a key aspect of the development of the Information Age. :Alon Cohen invented the type of audio that later enabled the creation of VoIP. VocalTec was the first company to offer Internet phone services and also became the first successful Internet IPO. Today, VoIP phones are a popular service that virtual offices offer. ;1990:The first Internet search engine was developed by McGill University. ;1991:The World Wide Web was released to the public. Also the first webcam, located at Cambridge University, was developed. ;1992:“Virtual Office” became a registered trademark for the first time when Richard Nissen registered the term with the UK's Intellectual Property Office. : IP-based videoconferencing technology evolved with more efficient video compression to allow PC-based use. CU-SeeMe was developed by Tim Dorcey at Cornell, which allowed users to videoconference and instant message other users. ;1994:Ralph Gregory presented virtual offices as a franchise opportunity in the United States, turning the business into an industry. ;1998:At the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Nagano, Japan, Seiji Ozawa used IP-based videoconferencing to conduct the Ode to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony simultaneously across five continents in near-real time. ;2000:The first Symbian phone, the touchscreen Ericsson R380 Smartphone, was released in 2000, and was the first device marketed as a \\"smartphone\\". It combined a PDA with a mobile phone. ;2003:Skype is released to the public, allowing free IP-based communications using microphone, webcam and instant messaging to individual consumers. ;2005:The official first “coworking space” opened in San Francisco by Brad Neuberg. That same year, the first Impact Hub coworking space launched in London. ;2006:Frank Cottle introduced the concept of wholesaling virtual offices and services to third-party retailers. This launched an influx of virtual office companies that still operate today.  Services  Virtual office infrastructure may include a variety of physical locations and services, as well as digital services. The infrastructure is shared across individuals and entities allowing resources to be utilized more efficiently. This allows users the flexibility of only renting or using the services they need. Physical Services * A business address * Mail services (receive, pick up and/or forwarding) * Conference rooms * Desk space and private offices * Printing and related services such as copying, binding, faxing, scanning, laminating, and shredding. * Receptionist services and answering services * Storage space * Photography studio Digital Services * A phone number * Online phone system (VoIP) * Virtual assistants * Website domains and email * Instant Message, chat and other web-based RTC platforms * Video conferencing, including webinar-hosting or other screensharing platforms * Online digital storage * Cloud-based applications (e.g. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides or Office 365)  Emerging Trends  Coworking is a related trend in flexible workspaces that places an emphasis on users interacting with each other to create a meta-office culture without working for the same company. Similar to virtual offices, coworking venues offer serviced workspaces and customers can use these on an as-needed basis. Virtual reality technology is another trend that may soon impact virtual offices. Virtual reality applications have the capability of creating offices spaces that are physical spaces within the virtual world where users can meet and work side-by-side, similar to how employees may telecommute now.  Controversy  Virtual offices have been criticized for enabling fraudulent companies by offering false addresses, phone numbers and temporary space that helps phony companies to look legitimate. Many virtual office companies are aware of these crimes and now take precautions in the form of background checks on their customers.

He wrote the Top 40 hit \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\", covered by, among others, Bobby Darin, Bob Dylan, Bob Seger, Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, The Four Tops, Robert Plant, Small Faces, Johnny Rivers, and Bert Jansch; his song \\"Reason to Believe\\" has also been covered by many artists, notably Rod Stewart (who had a chart hit with the song), Neil Young, and The Carpenters. Hardin is also known for his own recording career. Early life and career Hardin was born in Eugene, Oregon, and attended South Eugene High School. He dropped out of high school at age 18 to join the Marine Corps. Hardin is said to have discovered heroin while posted in Southeast Asia. After his discharge he moved to New York City in 1961, where he briefly attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He was excluded owing to truancy and began to focus on his musical career by performing around Greenwich Village, mostly in a blues style. After moving to Boston in 1963 he was discovered by the record producer Erik Jacobsen (later the producer for The Lovin' Spoonful), who arranged a meeting with Columbia Records. In 1964 he moved back to Greenwich Village to record for his contract with Columbia. The resulting recordings were not released and Columbia terminated Hardin's recording contract. After moving to Los Angeles in 1965, he met actress Susan Yardley Morss (known professionally as Susan Yardley), and moved back to New York with her. He signed to the Verve Forecast label, and produced his first authorized album, Tim Hardin 1 in 1966 which contained \\"Reason To Believe\\" and the ballad \\"Misty Roses\\", which received Top 40 radio play. Tim Hardin 2 was released in 1967; it contained \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\". A British tour was cut short after Hardin contracted pleurisy.\\"Tim Hardin Contracts Pleurisy\\", Rolling Stone, No. 16, August 24, 1968, p.5 An album entitled This is Tim Hardin, featuring covers of \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", Fred Neil's \\"Blues on the Ceiling\\" and Willie Dixon's \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", among others, appeared in 1967, on the Atco label. The liner notes indicate that the songs were recorded in 1963–1964, well prior to the release of Tim Hardin 1. In 1968, Verve released Tim Hardin 3 Live in Concert, a collection of live recordings along with re- makes of previous songs. It was followed by Tim Hardin 4, another collection of blues-influenced tracks believed to date from the same period as This is Tim Hardin. In September 1968 he and Van Morrison shared a bill at the Cafe au Go Go, at which each performed an acoustic set. In 1969, Hardin again signed with Columbia and had one of his few commercial successes, as a non-LP single of Bobby Darin's \\"Simple Song of Freedom\\" reached the US Top 50. Hardin did not tour in support of this single—his heroin use and stage fright made his live performances erratic. Also in 1969 he appeared at the Woodstock Festival, where he sang \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\" solo and played a set of his music while backed by a full band. None of his performances were included in the documentary film or the original soundtrack album. His performance of \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\" was included on the 1994 box-set Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music. He recorded three albums for Columbia—Suite for Susan Moore and Damion: We Are One, One, All in One; Bird on a Wire; and Painted Head. Later work and death During the following years Hardin moved between Britain and the U.S. His heroin addiction had taken control of his life by the time his last album, Nine, was released on GM Records in the UK in 1973 (the album did not see a U.S. release until it appeared on Antilles Records in 1976). He sold the writers' rights to his songs, but accounts of how this transpired differ. In late November 1975 Hardin performed as guest lead vocalist with the German experimental rock band Can, for two UK concerts at Hatfield Polytechnic in Hertfordshire and London's Drury Lane Theatre. According to author Rob Young, a huge argument between Hardin and Can occurred after the London concert, during which Hardin threw a television set through a car's windscreen (or windshield). Young, Rob & Schmidt, Irmin \\"All Gates Open: The Story of Can\\", Faber & Faber, 2018, , pp. 257-258). On December 29, 1980, Hardin was found on the floor of his Hollywood apartment by longtime friend Ron Daniels. He died of a heroin overdose. His remains were buried in Twin Oaks Cemetery in Turner, Oregon.

The target sequence to be amplified is colored green. In molecular biology, an amplicon is a piece of DNA or RNA that is the source and/or product of amplification or replication events. It can be formed artificially, using various methods including polymerase chain reactions (PCR) or ligase chain reactions (LCR), or naturally through gene duplication. In this context, amplification refers to the production of one or more copies of a genetic fragment or target sequence, specifically the amplicon. As it refers to the product of an amplification reaction, amplicon is used interchangeably with common laboratory terms, such as \\"PCR product.\\" Artificial amplification is used in research, forensics, and medicine for purposes that include detection and quantification of infectious agents, identification of human remains, and extracting genotypes from human hair. Natural gene duplication plays a major role in evolution. It is also implicated in several forms of human cancer including primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this context the term amplicon can refer both to a section of chromosomal DNA that has been excised, amplified, and reinserted elsewhere in the genome, and to a fragment of extrachromasomal DNA known as a double minute, each of which can be composed of one or more genes. Amplification of the genes encoded by these amplicons generally increases transcription of those genes and ultimately the volume of associated proteins. Structure Amplicons in general are direct repeat (head-to-tail) or inverted repeat (head-to-head or tail-to-tail) genetic sequences, and can be either linear or circular in structure. Circular amplicons consist of imperfect inverted duplications annealed into a circle and are thought to arise from precursor linear amplicons. During artificial amplification, amplicon length is dictated by the experimental goals.PCR Primer Design Guidelines. Premier Biosoft: Accelerating Research in Life Sciences. Retrieved from: http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html Technology Analysis of amplicons has been made possible by the development of amplification methods such as PCR, and increasingly by cheaper and more high- throughput technologies for DNA sequencing or next-generation sequencing, such as ion semiconductor sequencing, popularly referred to as the brand of the developer, Ion Torrent. DNA sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing have made it possible to study amplicons in genome biology and genetics, including cancer genetics research,International Cancer Genome Consortium Official Website phylogenetic research, and human genetics.National Human Genome Research Institute For example, using the 16S rRNA gene, which is part of every bacterial and archaeal genome and is highly conserved, bacteria can be taxonomically classified by comparison of the amplicon sequence to known sequences. This works similarly in the fungal domain with the 18S rRNA gene as well as the ITS1 non-coding region. Irrespective of the approach used to amplify the amplicons, some technique must be used to quantitate the amplified product.Stanley, J. (2002). Essentials of Immunology & Serology by Jacqueline Stanley. Albany, NY: Delmar. Generally, these techniques incorporate a capture step and a detection step, although how these steps are incorporated depends on the individual assay. Examples include the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Assay (RT-PCR), which has the capacity to recognize HIV in plasma; the HIV-1 QT (NASBA), which is used to measure plasma viral load by amplifying a segment of the HIV RNA; and transcription mediated amplification, which employs a hybridization protection assay to distinguish Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Various detection and capture steps are involved in each approach to assess the amplification product, or amplicon. With amplicon sequencing the high number of different amplicons resulting from amplification of a usual sample are concatenated and sequenced. After quality control classification is done by different methods, the counts of identical taxa representing their relative abundance in the sample. Applications PCR can be used to determine sex from a human DNA sample. The loci of Alu element insertion is selected, amplified and evaluated in terms of size of the fragment. The sex assay utilizes AluSTXa for the X chromosome, AluSTYa for the Y chromosome, or both AluSTXa and AluSTYa, to reduce the possibility of error to a negligible quantity. The inserted chromosome yields a large fragment when the homologous region is amplified. The males are distinguished as having two DNA amplicons present, while females have only a single amplicon. The kit adapted for carrying out the method includes a pair of primers to amplify the locus and optionally polymerase chain reaction reagents. LCR can be used to diagnose tuberculosis. The sequence containing protein antigen B is targeted by four oligonucleotide primers—two for the sense strand, and two for the antisense strand. The primers bind adjacent to one another, forming a segment of double stranded DNA that once separated, can serve as a target for future rounds of replication. In this instance, the product can be detected via the microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA).

The Quattrocento encompasses the artistic styles of the late Middle Ages (most notably International Gothic), the early Renaissance (beginning around 1425), and the start of the High Renaissance, generally asserted to begin between 1495 and 1500. Historical context After the decline of the Western Roman Empire in 476, economic disorder and disruption of trade spread across Europe. This was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages, which lasted roughly until the 11th century, when trade picked up, population began to expand and the people regained their authority. In the late Middle Ages, the political structure of the European continent slowly evolved from small, highly unstable fiefdoms into larger nation states ruled by monarchies, thereby providing greater stability. In Italy, urban centers arose that were populated by merchant and trade classes, who were able to defend themselves. Money replaced land as the medium of exchange, and increasing numbers of serfs became freedmen. The changes in Medieval Italy and the decline of feudalism paved the way for social, cultural, and economic changes. The Quattrocento is viewed as the transition from the Medieval period to the age of the Italian Renaissance, principally in the cities of Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice, Naples, and was compared with the Timurid Renaissance. Development of Quattrocento styles Quattrocento art shed the decorative mosaics typically associated with Byzantine art along with the Christian and Gothic media of and styles in stained glass, frescoes, illuminated manuscripts and sculpture. Instead, Quattrocento artists incorporated the more classic forms developed by classical Roman and Greek art. List of Italian Quattrocento artists Since the Quattrocento overlaps with part of the Renaissance, it would be inaccurate to say that a particular artist was Quattrocento or Renaissance.

Geography Albion is bounded by Wooloowin in the north, Ascot in the east, Newstead in the south, and Windsor to the west, with Breakfast Creek defining the suburb border in its south and south-west. Sandgate Road, a major road on the north side of Brisbane, runs through the middle of the suburb. A variety of housing styles, from former workers' cottages through to modern brick homes and unit blocks, can be found in Albion. Breakfast Creek is a neighbourhood within the west of the suburb (). The Albion Park Paceway, first established in the 1880s, is a harness racing club and greyhound racing track found in Breakfast Creek, a locality in southern Albion. History Albion Hotel, Brisbane, ca. 1866, from which the suburb of Albion takes its name 2The name Breakfast Creek comes from Breakfast Point, which was a rocky point of the downstream side of the creek and was named by explorer John Oxley during his 1823 exploration of the Brisbane River. The name Albion comes from the Albion Hotel built by Thomas Hayseldon (also written as Hazeldon), which was so called because the white wall of John Petrie's quarry reminded Hayseldon of the England's white cliffs (Albion being an old name for England, from the Latin albus meaning white). From 1866 to 1870, the proprietor was Edward Hudson. The low lying parts of Albion came into the limelight when a swampy area near the Breakfast Creek was designated as the racecourse. In 1885, it became the headquarters of the Smithfield Pony Club and later in 1895 of the Albion Park Racecourse. Many Chinese migrants settled here and the Temple of the Holy Triad was built on the Higgs Street for the local community in 1885-86. Breakfast Creek State School opened on 7 July 1890. It closed on 11 August 1961. It was on the western side of Agnes Street (). On 27 September1880, eight blocks of land of \\"Corunna Estate\\" were advertised for auction by John Cameron. On 28 October 1899, sixty allotments of land of Albion Hill estate, being re-subdivisions 1 to 60, of subdivision of section 3 of portion 162, Parish of Enoggera, were advertised for auction by Isles, Love & Co. The advertising map states the estate's proximity to Albion Train Station, with 76 trains daily. The land for sale was situated between Camden St, Albion, and Ford St and Old Sandgate Rd (now Bonney Ave), Clayfield. On 5 December 1926 Roman Catholic Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone for St Columban's College at \\"Highlands\\" at 451 Sandgate Road (). The school officially opened on Sunday 29 January 1928 as a school for boys operated by the Christian Brothers. In 1985 the Christian Brothers passed the management of the college to the Brisbane Diocese. This triggered a number of changes, a phasing out the primary school to focus on secondary schooling. In 1996 the school accepted enrolments from girls and in 1997 the school relocated to Caboolture. The Albion site has been redeveloped as The Clayfield retirement village but three heritage buildings have been retained on the site: Highlands, O'Driscoll Hall and Whytecliffe. In the , Albion had a population of 2,296 people.

The median age of the Albion population was 33 years, 4 years below the national median of 37. 67.7% of people living in Albion were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 4.4%, England 3.1%, India 3%, Italy 1.2%, China 1.1%. 79% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 2.1% Italian, 1.2% Mandarin, 1.1% Nepali, 1% Arabic, 0.8% Punjabi. Of the total population in Albion, 1.2% were Indigenous persons. In wealth terms, the median weekly individual income in Albion is approximately A$200 higher than the Australian average, and a median weekly family income A$220 higher. The suburb has a significantly higher proportion of residents that have never married (49.0%) compared to the Australian average (33.2%) and, in turn, a lower proportion of married persons (29.6% vs 49.6%). Transport On the Queensland Rail City network, Albion is serviced by Albion railway station on the Airport, Doomben, Caboolture, Shorncliffe and Sunshine Coast lines. Historically, Albion lay on the Clayfield tram line, along Sandgate Road. It was operated by the Brisbane City Council until 13 April 1969.

The black-eared kite is somewhat distinct morphologically, but is better considered a well-marked parapatric subspecies. The status of the Cape Verde kite is in doubt; while not a completely monophyletic lineage according to mtDNA data, it is still best regarded as a distinct species. Whatever its status, this population is extinct. A prehistoric kite from the Early Pleistocene (1.8 million–780,000 years ago) deposits at Ubeidiya (Israel) was described as Milvus pygmaeus.

Housed in the Batcave, which it accesses through a hidden entrance, the Batmobile is both a heavily armored tactical assault vehicle and a personalized custom- built pursuit and capture vehicle that is used by Batman in his fight against crime. Using the latest civilian performance technology, coupled with prototype military-grade hardware—most of which was developed by Wayne Enterprises—Batman creates an imposing hybrid monster to prowl the streets of Gotham City. The Batmobile first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), where it was depicted as an ordinary-looking red car. Its appearance has varied but, since its earliest appearances, the Batmobile has had a prominent bat motif, typically including wing-shaped tailfins. Armored in the early stages of Batman's career, it has been customized over time and is the most technologically advanced crime-fighting asset in Batman's arsenal. Depictions of the vehicle have evolved along with the character, with each incarnation reflecting evolving car technologies. It has been portrayed as having many uses, such as vehicular pursuit, prisoner transportation, anti-tank warfare, riot control, and as a mobile crime lab. In some depictions, the Batmobile has individually articulated wheel mounts and is able to be driven unmanned or can be remotely operated. It has appeared in every Batman iteration—from comic books and television to films and video games—and has since become part of popular culture. Publication history =DC Universe= 20th century =Golden Age of Comic Books= An early Batmobile design from Batman #5 (March 1941). Art by Bob Kane and Jerry Robinson. Batman is shown driving a red car in his debut story in Detective Comics #27. The red car was never mentioned by name as the Batmobile. Although the Batplane was introduced in Detective Comics #31, the name \\"Batmobile\\" was not applied to Batman's automobile until Detective Comics #48 (February 1941). The car's design evolved in early Batman stories. It became a \\"specially built high-powered auto\\" by Detective Comics #30, and in Batman #5 (March 1941), it had a bat hood ornament and a darker exterior color. The predominant designs settled on a large, dark-colored body and bat-like accessories such as large tailfins scalloped to resemble a bat's wings. Other bat-vehicles soon followed, including the Batcycle, Batboat, and Robin's Redbird. Batman #5 (March 1941) introduced a long, powerful, streamlined Batmobile with a tall scalloped fin and an intimidating bat head on the front. Three pages after its introduction, it was forced off a cliff by the Joker and crashed in the ravine below. An identical Batmobile appeared in the next story printed in the same issue. =Silver Age of Comic Books= Batman the television series was so popular that its campy humor and its version of Batmobile were imported into Batman's comics. The iconic television Batmobile was a superficially modified concept car, the decade-old Lincoln Futura, owned by auto customizer George Barris, whose shop did the work.Van Hise, James, The Green Hornet (Book), Schuster & Schuster, 1988, p.24. The deliberate silliness of the television show did not sit well with longtime Batman comic book fans. When the series was canceled in 1968, the comic books became darker and more serious. The comics' version of Batman abandoned that version of the Batmobile. Its replacement was a simpler model with a stylized bat's head silhouette decal on the hood being the only decoration of note. The 1960s TV style Batmobile still appears from time to time in the comic books, most recently in Detective Comics #850 and in Batman Confidential. =Bronze Age of Comic Books= In the Bronze Age of Comic Books, the source of the cars was explained in The Untold Legend of the Batman as the work of stunt driver Jack Edison. Edison had volunteered to personally construct Batmobiles for Batman after being rescued from a burning wreck. In mid-1985, a special variation of the Super Powers toyline Batmobile appeared in both Batman and Detective Comics. This design had a full set of front and rear canopies, \\"Coke-bottle\\" sides, integrated fins, and generally rounder features, just like the toy. The only difference between this car and its toy counterpart is the nose, which was sometimes drawn as longer and more pointed. =Modern Age of Comic Books= Beginning in the 1990s, the number of comics featuring Batman mushroomed with spin-off titles, limited series, and graphic novels. At the same time, there was considerable experimentation with styles of illustration. With different illustration styles in so many different books, there was naturally a corresponding diversity of designs for the Batmobile. This has continued with designs for the Batmobile ranging from conservative and practical to highly stylized to outlandish. During the \\"Cataclysm\\" storyline, it is revealed that Batman has hidden a number of spare vehicles across the city just in case. A Humvee serves as a primary mean of transportation to cross the earthquake-ravaged city during the Aftershock storyline, as the Batmobile is wrecked by the quake. These vehicles are not as sophisticated as the Batmobiles, but some of them are armed with non-lethal riot control and combat artilleries and armored to withstand ammunition mounted on military automobile prototypes. 21st century =2000s= In the \\"Batman: Hush\\" storyline, a double-page spread by Jim Lee shows various Batmobiles (from comics, movies, and all TV series) in storage in the Batcave, reveals that Batman now has more than one of his iconic ground vehicles. In addition, some incarnations of the character, such as Batman: The Animated Series, establish that Batman has a large ground vehicle fleet of various makes and models as well as utility vehicles to use when the Batmobile would be too conspicuous. In issue 9 of the third volume of Teen Titans, Robin and his friends use a Batmobile that he shipped out to San Francisco, hiding the expense \\"in the Batarang budget\\". The 2008 book Batmobile Owner's Manual, gives theoretical specifications of the car as if it were a real car. The book states that the Batmobile's five cylinder engine is more powerful than turbine jet engines, and capable of achieving up to .Batmobile Owner's Manual. 2008. Page 21. . Publisher: Dorling Kindersley. In the 2009 series Batman and Robin, a new Batmobile is unveiled. This model is capable of flight, although is not as maneuverable as the Batwing.Batman #689 It can fire 19 types of projectiles, one of which is a flame retardant non-toxic foam, and features a concussive sonic blast device. This Batmobile was designed and constructed by Bruce Wayne. However, its construction was the source of great frustration to him, as mentioned by Alfred, and thus not finished. In Batman and Robin #1 it is revealed that Bruce's son, Damian Wayne, solved the problem of its inability to fly and completed it. =2010s= Batmobile in Batman Annual vol. 3, #1 (January 2017). Art by David Finch. The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given new aesthetics. In 2016, DC Comics relaunched its comic books once again in DC Rebirth and opted to rebrand the continuity to \\"DC Universe\\" in December 2017. While many different models of the Batmobile are seen within the Batcave, the model that is primarily used in DC Universe is a revised version with a more rectangular design and armored appearance. However, this is not always the case, such as in Batman vol. 3, #4 and #5. In the future neo-Gotham, a sleek, flying car version of the Batmobile is primarily used instead.Batman: Rebirth #1 DC Comics.Batman (vol. 3) #13. DC Comics.Detective Comics (vol. 1) #935. DC Comics.Batman Beyond (vol. 8) =Elseworlds= In Batman: Holy Terror, the Batmobile is depicted on a two- page spread at the end of the story, with Bruce musing that it was provided to him by the remaining members of the underground movement against the religious dictatorship that rules the world in this timeline. In Batman & Dracula: Red Rain, the Batmobile is presented as a basic open-topped car with a single bat- wing at its rear, similar in design to the original Batmobile in the comics. Batman was forced to abandon the Batmobile after the destruction of Wayne Manor to stop Dracula's vampire 'family' deprived him of a suitable place to keep the car, although Bruce reflects that he no longer needs the car after his transformation into a vampire grants him bat-like wings. However, it is revealed in Crimson Mist- the third novel in the trilogy- that the Batmobile survives in the remains of the Batcave, with Alfred briefly hiding behind it to escape Killer Croc during a chase through the cave. In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, the Batmobile has been modified into a tank-like armored riot control vehicle, complete with machine guns shooting rubber bullets, a large cannon mounted on the front, and large tank treads in place of tires. According to Batman's narration, the only thing that can penetrate its armor \\"isn't from this planet\\". Batman also mentions that it was Dick Grayson who came up with the name. The tank-like vehicle appears to take up two lanes of traffic on a normal road, evidenced when returning from Batman's initial fight with the leader of the Mutants, and thus is too big for normal land travel around Gotham. In the scenes prior to Batman's last stand with the Joker, Batman uses a motorcycle to traverse the city, using the tank again after the attempted nuclear strike and fires in Gotham, although it is torn apart during Batman's battle with Superman. This Batmobile reappeared in All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder #4, which shows its construction by robots in the Batcave. In Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder, the car can convert into a harrier jet and a submarine. Dick Grayson comments that the name Batmobile is \\"totally queer\\".All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder #3 However, in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, which exists in the same continuity,Sanderson, Peter \\"Comics in Context #119: All-Star Bats\\", IGN, February 6, 2006 Grayson was stated as the one who coined the name.Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Popular culture =Exhibition= Barris built two fiberglass copies of the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing. Eventually, the three copies (and the screen-used metal Futura Batmobile) were covered with a black velvet \\"fuzz\\" paint, presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies. Later, all three were restored to their gloss black paint job. The three replicas are all based on a 1965–1966 Ford Galaxie. The #1 Barris-built Batmobile sold at Barrett-Jackson Auctions on January 19, 2013 for $4,620,000,. The three Barris copies all reside in private collections, including the exhibition drag racing version driven by wheelstanding driver Wild Bill Shrewsberry. This car was built with a dual-quad Holman Moody Ford 427 V8 engine, Art Carr-prepared Ford C6 automatic transmission and 5.14 gears in the rear end. Quarter-mile times were in the mid-12 second range, primarily because Shrewsberry would launch the car in second gear and smoke the overinflated rear tires for show down most of the strip. The \\"rocket exhaust\\" was made functional via a tank filled with either gasoline or kerosene which was pumped out the exhaust port and ignited electrically. *The #1 Barris-built Batmobile, built from the original 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car, was purchased by Richard Champagne of Ahwatukee, Arizona at the Barrett-Jackson Auction in January 2013 for $4,620,000. It was subsequently purchased privately by Dr. David Anderson, owner of Batmobile #2, for an undisclosed sum.http://1966batmobile.com/history/original-1/ *The #2 Barris-built Batmobile is owned by Dr. David Anderson of Virginia, and has not been repaired or restored. Original purchase price was $225,000. *The #3 Barris- built Batmobile was purchased and restored by Dennis M. Danzik of Paradise Valley, Arizona. It was reportedly purchased for $600,000. Danzik also owns the majority of the Warner Brothers 1989 Batmobile. *The #4 Barris-built Batmobile is owned by Doug Jackson, and is located in Southern California. *The so-called #5 Batmobile, originally built by Jim Sermersheim (on a 1958 Thunderbird chassis) was owned by George Barris until 1989. It went for sale on JamesEdition in June 2017 for an asking price of USD 250,000. =Replicas= In October 2010, DC Comics authorized Fiberglass Freaks in Logansport, Indiana, to build officially licensed 1966 Batmobile replicas. These replicas have been sold to customers in England, Italy, Canada, and across the U.S. One of Fiberglass Freaks' 1966 Batmobile replicas sold at an RM auction for $216,000. Fiberglass Freaks' owner Mark Racop has been a 1966 Batman fan since he was two years old, and he built his first 1966 Batmobile replica when he was seventeen. A replica Batmobile was displayed alongside two of the movie Batmobiles at the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Keswick, England for several years. In 2011 the collection was sold to the American collector Michael Dezer for his Miami Auto Museum. A replica of the Barris- built Batmobile is owned by Andreas Ugland. He bought the Batmobile at a London car auction in 2007. Both Batmobile and Batcycle at the London car auction were replicas. It is displayed at the Cayman Motor Museum. *A replica Batmobile was sold at the Coys Spring Classic Cars Auction on February 27, 2007 at the Royal Horticultural Hall in London. Coys Auctions had said it expected the car to fetch more than £75,000 - the final and closing bid was £119,000, equivalent to $233,000 USD at the time. *In the movie Rock Star, Mark Wahlberg's character is given to extravagant spending; one of his first purchases is the original Batmobile from the TV series. *An episode of The Simpsons guest-starred Adam West with the Batmobile. Another episode featured the Batmobile in a museum of famous cars next to Herbie the Love Bug and a car from Mad Max. The latter episode featured a live Batman and Robin in the vehicle, who had both tried poorly to conceal the fact that they were not dummies. *On an episode of The Man Show, a guest won a ride in the Batmobile with Adam West in the \\"Wheel of Destiny\\" segment. *The Lincoln Futura version of the Batmobile is seen in the movie The Benchwarmers, driven by Jon Lovitz. *The Batmobile appears as an Easter Egg in the video game King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne, accompanied by a version of the 1966 TV theme. *In 2003, Adam West and Burt Ward reunited for a tongue-in-cheek telefilm titled Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt which combined dramatised recreations of the filming of the original series (with younger actors standing in for the stars), with modern-day footage of West and Ward searching for a stolen Batmobile. *In issue 9 of the comic series Justice (February 2007), Batman dons a suit of armor visually influenced by the original Batmobile from the TV series. *Hobbyists have built a number of duplicates of the TV Batmobile, sharing sources for parts and assembly kits. *A functional replica of the Batmobile was finished in 2010 in Arboga, Sweden, for a reality show to be shot in the United States. In 2011, the vehicle, valued to 4 million SEK (more than US$600,000) was reported stolen, and is currently (March 2013) unlocated. =Promotional tours= 1963 Batmobile exhibited February 2014 shortly after restoration with original builder's daughters Karen and Darlene Robinson. The first car ever publicly toured as a Batmobile was built several years before the Barris Batmobile of the TV series. It was inspired by DC Comics and was created in 1960 and finished in 1963 by Forrest Robinson of Westmoreland, N.H. using a 1956 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 chassis powered by an Oldsmoblle Rocket 324 cubic inch engine and building a handmade custom body. The car was initially used unpainted for a short time as a daily driver and then later leased by a DC Comic licensee (National Periodical publications then owner of DC Comics licensed the use of Batman characters including the Batmobile to various companies), painted in Batman Colors replete with official Batman decals, and toured as \\"Batman's Batmobile\\" in several small towns on the East coast of the United States. It was used as part of an advertising program for All Star Dairy Products which had a Batman dessert product line. After the TV Batmobile by George Barris was created and replicas were made available for promotional events in late 1966, the first Batmobile was returned to Robinson. Robinson then removed the official Batman decals, repainted it in silver, and again used it as a daily driver for a short time and then sold it. After laying in a field in New Hampshire for almost five decades the very poorly preserved car was sold in 2008 and after going unrestored through a few owners was sold in February 2013. After a year of work in 2013 the car was restored by expert car restorer Mario Borbon of Borbon Fabrications in Sacramento, California. =Copyright status= The Batmobile is copyrighted in the 9th circuit under United States law by DC Comics, a status often thought to usually be reserved to sentient fictional characters. This was established in court when a mechanic making Batmobile replicas roughly based on the '60s Adam West version of the Batmobile was sued by DC Comics in 2011 in the case DC Comics v Mark Towle. The mechanic had argued that the Batmobile was a \\"functional\\" element of the show and thus ineligible for copyright; however, the court ruled that the Batmobile was an \\"automotive character\\" with its own style, backstory, and theme that remained consistent across versions: a \\"bat-like appearance\\" and \\"always contains the most up-to-date weaponry and technology\\".DC Comics Is Entitled to Copyright on Batmobile, Appeals Court RulesDC Comics v. Mark Towle In addition, builder George Barris applied for and received a US Design Patent for the car in 1966. Although the patent expired in 1980, during its lifetime it served as the basis for Barris' successfully claiming ownership of the Jim Sermersheim \\"No. 5\\" Batmobile replica. Monster Jam The Batman monster truck, competing in Phoenix, Arizona in 2006 In 2006, a Batman monster truck made its debut at Charlotte, 2006. This truck was designed after the Batmobile, with a pair of wings and afterburners in the back. It was a major competitor in the Monster Jam live tour, leading driver John Seasock to two consecutive racing wins at the 2007 and 2008 Monster Jam World Finals. In 2013, the truck's design was changed, with smaller wings, and the afterburners replaced with a large Bat- logo. The truck was retired in late 2014, after the DC license expired. Appearances in other media =Animation= The Batmobile made a brief cameo at the end of the Looney Tunes Show episode \\"Reunion\\". Bugs Bunny drove off in it after seeing the Bat-Signal because, in that show, he is secretly Batman. This Batmobile slightly resembles the Golden Age version. The Batman/Superman Hour According to the site BatmobileHistory.com, the Batmobile created for the 1968–1969 Filmation Associates TV series was not strongly based on its immediate predecessor (except for sharing dual rear cockpit canopies with the Barris/Futura Batmobile) or any version in DC Comics publications of the time. Furthermore, Filmation's Batmobile featured a long, black body with what is described as a \\"Coke bottle\\" profile, with a large, light blue bat emblem set across the hood, which, when a dashboard control was activated, the metal bat symbol folded its \\"wings\\" up at its center, forming a barricade/chain cutter. There were no door-mounted bat symbols. Another departure from the Barris Batmobile was a single windshield and large, elevated bat-fins. Curiously, the car's underside was colored light blue, and it appeared to conceal the car's chassis except for a motorized panel, from which devices such as the Bat-winch would emerge. It is assumed Filmation's Batmobile used this light blue underside color to make the panel and devices easier to see. Additionally, the cockpit seating was a vibrant red, with a dashboard panel using bat accents around an inset monitor screen, among other details. Filmation's Batmobile used parachutes, inflatable pontoons and, in case of damaged tires, vertical and rear-mounted jets to lift and propel the car — which then essentially caused it to function as a high-powered hovercraft. The Filmation Batmobile from The Batman/Superman Hour was one of the few Batmobiles not to see adaptations to any DC Comics publications or have any commercially available replicas (toys, diecast cars, plastic model kits, etc.). Super Friends The Batmobile seen in the early episodes of Super Friends was based on the Lincoln Futura design in the live-action TV series starring Adam West. The main difference with the Super Friends version was that the car's lines were modified substantially for use in animation. The most obvious change was to the car's nose, where the hood received a \\"V\\" depression that echoed the lower fascia. This was also the first Batmobile (of any medium) to feature yellow bat emblems on the doors. This particular feature would be quickly adapted by the comics. Beginning with the Challenge of the Super Friends in 1978, the Batmobile got revamped. This new version was developed to have a more aerodynamic, hard-edged style. In addition, this Batmobile was smaller than its predecessor. It had a sloped nose and flying buttress B-pillars. Features that were carried over from the original Super Friends Batmobile were the Bat-mask, low horizontal fins, twin bubble windshields, and blue coloring scheme. In 1984, Super Friends revamped its format (first as Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show and then as The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians) to serve as a tie-in to Kenner's Super Powers Collection. DC animated universe The Batmobile throughout the DC animated universe The Batmobile made appearances in the various series of the DC animated universe. =Batman: The Animated Series= The Batmobile in Batman: The Animated Series combined style elements from various eras to produce a long, low vehicle with square lines, long fins and a blunt nose with a massive chrome grill that could have been from any time from the 1930s to the 1990s. This version of the Batmobile also vaguely resembled the Batmobile from the first two Tim Burton movies. Despite the obvious presence of the jet exhaust, the show frequently used sound effects from a reciprocating engine for the Batmobile's driving scenes. This, plus direct views of the engine (as seen in the episode \\"The Mechanic\\"), suggest that the car used a large piston engine for primary power and an auxiliary jet for high-speed acceleration. It also had an armored stationary mode to prevent people from tampering with the car when it was left unattended, though this was not as overt as the \\"shields\\" used in the 1989 movie Batmobile. The original Batmobile design had many design variants as well as Bruce Wayne's limousine, as seen in Batman Beyond, which the producers referred to as \\"an upside-down Batmobile\\". It also made a cameo in the episode \\"The Call, Part 1\\", of the third season of Batman Beyond. Features Among the features of the Batmobile were the following: *smoke and oil dispensers *wheel slasher hubs *missile rack, *tear gas dispensers *ejection seats *titanium alloy wheels and body panels *reversible jet exhausts *shield platings Replicas Massimo Tonoi is the owner of a Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile real-life replica. =The New Batman Adventures= Frank Miller and Greg Capullo sign a toy Batmobile based on the animated series during an appearance at Midtown Comics. The Batmobile was redesigned in The New Batman Adventures with its jet engine being most notably absent. This Batmobile design is re-used in Justice League, and Justice League Unlimited, though it appears somewhat more blue than black in paint color. The vehicle possessed bullet resistant cockpit windows. If the tire were shredded a replacement tire immediately takes over after discarding the previous. =Batman Beyond= A new flying Batmobile design appears in Batman Beyond used by the new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made multiple appearances in the future of the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is a radical departure from the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from a bat faceplate on the grill, to tail fins resembling bat wings. This version of the Batmobile is a simple sleek pod with sharp angles and rounded sides. Its interior is a red illuminated single-person cockpit, with computer circuitry and displays visible all around. It is armed with guided immobilizer missiles and grappling cables. Being a \\"single-seat\\" by design, it was never meant to carry two people, as shown when Terry's friend Maxine was once sitting behind the seat to great discomfort. According to Bruce, the vehicles top speed is Mach 3; however Terry has never piloted the vehicle at those speeds through Gotham City. It features a drop down hatch; this allows Terry swift exit/entrance from underneath without having to park the vehicle and get out, allowing him to literally get the drop on his opponents. Like Terry's batsuit the Batmobile features a camouflage system rendering it invisible; however another system consisting of holographic projector disguising it as a simple garbage dumpster or random car to keep away prying eyes and potential vandals. The vehicle has built in digital recorders and cameras for collecting audio and visual evidence. The Batman In the animated series The Batman, the Batmobile resembled a sports coupe with multiple jet exhaust slits protruding from the back bumper. In the third season episode \\"RPM\\", this Batmobile was wrecked beyond repair, and Batman completed a prototype design that included a Wayne Industries 'EXP' power generator. This Batmobile was longer and had a lower profile with only one triangular jet exhaust coming from the rear of the car resembling the one from Batman: The Animated Series. At the end of the episode, Batman remarks that due to the Batmobile EXP's success, it is a 'keeper'. In the fourth season, the episode \\"Artifacts\\" explores Gotham City in the year 2027, looking back from 3027, complete with a new tank-like Batmobile reminiscent of Frank Miller's design for the Batmobile in The Dark Knight Returns. Batman: Gotham Knight In the straight-to-DVD animated shorts collection Gotham Knight, the Batmobile makes an appearance in the feature entitled \\"Field Test\\". While set in the same continuity as Christopher Nolan's films, it is visually a pastiche of the Batmobile as it has appeared in various films. Also, the Batmobile appears in the feature entitled \\"Working Through Pain\\"; wherein Alfred arrives to pick up Batman. The Batmobile appearing in this scene seems to be inspired by its appearance in the 1989 live-action film. Batman: The Brave and The Bold The Batmobile in Batman: The Brave and the Bold takes design elements from the Golden Age Batmobiles and the Lincoln Futura. This Batmobile has the ability to transform into other vehicles. The tie in toyline's Batmobile shares this feature, transforming from car to jet. On at least one occasion, it has converted into a mecha similar to the Bat- Bots seen in Kingdom Come. In the episode \\"Game Over for Owlman\\", Batman is forced to use a back-up Batmobile which resembles a Studebaker. Beware the Batman The Batmobile in \\"Beware the Batman\\" is a low and flat F1 like car with a single seated cockpit and pointed nose. The car has horizontal fins flanking a pair of jet engines, large wheels with low profile tires, as well as sharply angled canopy. This version, as is common with Batmobiles, seems very durable, with low profile armoring, as throughout the show it has taken shots from rocket launchers without any noticeable damage, stood up to high powered demolition machinery without any visible markings to the point of breaking said machinery, etc. The interior features a voice command system, a video link system, and more, directly routed to the Batcomputer. The Lego Movie In The Lego Movie a large six-wheeled version of the Batmobile (which is actually the Batwing transformed by Batman) appears equipped with sub-woofers. It is destroyed during the attack on Cloud Cuckoo Land. The Lego Batman Movie In The Lego Batman Movie, multiple versions of the Batmobile from different Batman adaptations appear. In the film, Batman drives the \\"SpeedWagon\\" Batmobile, which appears to take inspiration from previous Batmobiles. This Batmobile also uses \\"atomic batteries\\", a feature seen in 1960s depictions. Other Batmobiles appear briefly, including the one from the 1960s television series, Tim Burton films, Batman Forever, the Golden Age, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, The Dark Knight trilogy, and Batman: The Animated Series. The Speedwagon was fault-driven by \\"Nightwing\\" (alter-ego of Robin when Batman is missing in the world) combining with the novice skills of Nightwing caused the speed wagon's destruction, but at the climax of the movie, Batman, his bat-family, and former Joker henchmen make a new Batmobile with four detachable vehicles (Bat-Plane for Batgirl, Bat-Assault Vehicle for Bat-Alfred, Bat-Cycle (inspired by The Dark Knight) for Robin and a proper Batmobile for Batman). =Live-action= Batman (1943 serial) In the 1943 serial film Batman, a black 1939 Cadillac Series 75 convertible was used by Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, as well as their secret identities Batman and Robin. (It was driven with the top down as Bruce and Dick, and with the top up when they were in disguise.)http://www.batmobilehistory.com/1943-batmobile.php Alfred chauffeured the Dynamic Duo in both identities. Batman and Robin (1949 serial) In Batman and Robin, the 1949 successor to the original serial, the duo drive around in a 1949 Mercury. Batman (1960s film/television series) The Lincoln Futura-based Batmobile as seen in the 1960s Batman TV series alt= In late 1965 20th Century Fox Television and William Dozier's Greenway Productions contracted renowned Hollywood car customizer Dean Jeffries to design and build a \\"Batmobile\\" for their upcoming Batman TV series. He started customizing a 1959 Cadillac, but when the studio wanted the program on the air in January 1966, and therefore filming sooner than he could provide the car, Jeffries was paid off, and the project went to George Barris.St. Antoine, Arthur. \\"Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend\\". Motor Trend Magazine What became the iconic Batmobile used in the 1966–1968 live action television show and its film adaptation was a customized vehicle that originated as a one-off 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car,George Barris, David Fetherston, Barris TV and Movie Cars, pages 20–27 (MBI Publishing Company, 1996) created by Ford Motor Company lead stylists Bill Schmidt, Doug Poole Sr., and John Najjar and their design team at the Lincoln Styling Department. In 1954, the Futura prototype was built entirely by hand by the Ghia Body Works in Turin, Italy, at a reported cost of US$250,000—the equivalent of approximately US$2 million in 2009. It made its debut in pearlescent Frost-Blue white paint on January 8, 1955 at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1959, sporting a fresh red paint job, the Futura was featured in the film It Started with a Kiss, starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford. Barris was trying to get Hollywood's attention with the Futura, which he had purchased from Ford for the nominal sum of $1.00 and \\"other valuable consideration\\", but aside from its film appearance, the Futura had been languishing in his Hollywood shop for several years. With only three weeks to finish the Batmobile (although in recent years Jeffries says that his car was dropped because he was told it was needed in \\"a week and a half\\",St. Antoine, Arthur, Motor Trend interview he was quoted in 1988 as saying \\"three weeks\\"Van Hise, James, p.24 as well), Barris decided that, rather than building a car from scratch, it would be relatively easy to transform the distinctive Futura into the famous crime-fighting vehicle. Design work was conducted by Herb Grasse, working as an associate designer for Barris. Barris hired Bill Cushenberry to do the metal modifications to the car and its conversion into the Batmobile was completed in just three weeks, at a reported cost of US$30,000. They used the primer-painted, white-striped car in October 1965, for a network presentation reel. Shortly afterward, the car was painted gloss black with \\"fluorescent cerise\\" stripes. Barris retained ownership of the car, estimated to be worth $125,000 in 1966 dollars, leasing it to 20th Century Fox and Greenway Productions for use in the series. When filming for the series began, several problems arose due to the car's age: it overheated, the battery died, and the expensive Mickey Thompson tires repeatedly failed. By mid season, the engine and transmission were replaced with those of a Ford Galaxie. The most frequent visual influence of this car is that later Batmobiles usually have a rear rocket thruster that fires as the car starts up. In November 2012 Barris Kustom and George Barris announced the sale of the Batmobile at the Barrett-Jackson car show and auction held in Scottsdale, Arizona. The vehicle fetched $4.2 million on January 19, 2013.https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/01/20/batmobile-auction- barrett-jackson/1848733/ accessdate=January 20, 2013 =Technical specifications= *Curb weight: 4500 lbhttp://www.maismotores.net/wp- content/uploads/2015/03/batmobiles-012815-02-2ea4c.jpg *Wheelbase: 126 in *Length: 226 in *Width: 90 in *Height: 48 in *Fins: 84 in *Engine: 390 in³ Ford FE V-8 *Transmission: B&M; C-6 Automatic (2nd transmission) =Features= This Batmobile's gadgets include a nose-mounted aluminum Cable Cutter Blade, Bat Ray Projector, Anti-Theft Device, Detect-a-scope, Batscope, Bat Eye Switch, Antenna Activator, Police Band Cut-In Switch, Automatic Tire Inflation Device, Remote Batcomputer—radio linked to the main Batcomputer in the Batcave, the Batphone, Emergency Bat Turn Lever, Anti-Fire Activator, Bat Smoke, Bat Photoscope, and many other Bat gadgets. If needed, the Batmobile is capable of a quick 180° \\"bat-turn\\" thanks to two rear-mounted ten-foot Deist parachutes. The main license plate seen throughout the series was 2F-3567 (1966). Some changes were made during the run of the series, including different license plates (TP-3567; BT-1 and BAT-1), removal of the Futura steering wheel and substitution with a 1958 Edsel steering wheel, and the addition of extra gadgets such as a net in the trunk, remote-controlled driving, a rear-facing camera under the turbine exhaust port, and the Bat Ram. Gotham At the beginning of the Season Four episode \\"A Dark Knight: That's Entertainment\\", Alfred takes Bruce to the garage at Wayne Manor on his seventeenth birthday to present him with his gift: a heavily fortified matte- black Ford Mustang that functions as a proto-Batmobile, the choice of make being a reference to the original Batmobile which was a modified Lincoln Futura and manufactured by Ford. Titans In the episode \\"Jason Todd\\" during a flashback to Dick Grayson's time as part of the dynamic duo, the Batmobile is shown very briefly, parked inside the Batcave. This version of the car was initially designed by concept artist John Gallagher, who provided the visual effects company Encore VFX with over 30 designs before it was whittled down to one final piece with the efforts of other artists and contributors. This Batmobile was later shown in greater detail during the season finale when the Gotham City Police Department launched an assault on the Batcave. Batman (1989 film) / Batman Returns Tim Burton's live- action films Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) presented a different version of the Batmobile, which reflected those films' Art Deco version of Gotham City.Anton Furst, 47, Dies; Designer of 'Batman', The New York Times, November 26, 1991 The car was designed by conceptual illustrator Julian Caldow who also designed the Batwing. The body of the car was sculpted by Keith Short in collaboration with Eddie Butler. It was long, low and sleek, and was built on a Chevrolet Impala chassis. One of the two screen-used Batmobiles is now housed at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. The other is kept in a garage at Jon Peters' Malibu home. The back of the Batmobile resembles the back of the Fiat Turbina, which was a gas-turbine concept from the 1950s. =Technical specifications= *Length: 260.7 in *Width: 94.4 in *Height: 51.2 in *Wheelbase: 141.0 in *Wheels: Cast alloy, 15 × 6.5 *Tires: High aspect L60-15 *Acceleration: 0–60 in 3.7 seconds *Maximum Top Speed: with jet booster *Maximum Turn Speed: with grappling hook *Maximum Jump Distance: *Engine: 10,000 Horsepower Jet Turbine *Fuel: High octane; 97% special (gasoline paraffin mixture) *Torque: 1750 lbf.ft at 98.7% ROS *Launchers: Side-mounted grappling hook *Carjack: Central \\"foot\\" capable of lifting the car and rotating it 180°. =Features= Spherical bombs could be deployed from its sides. An afterburner was housed in the back. Two M1919 Browning machine guns were hidden behind flaps in each fender. Its grappling hook, once hooked on a structure, serves as an anchor to allow the batmobile to make an extremely sharp turn at high speed that its pursuers typically cannot duplicate. It had superhydraulics for course changes, and a batdisc ejector (side-mounted) that could fire precisely 15 Batdiscs in the 1-second pulse. Other gadgets included chassis-mounted shinbreakers, oil slick dispensers and smoke emitters. Inside, the two-seat cockpit featured aircraft-like instrumentation, a passenger's side monitor, self-diagnostics system, CD recorder, and voice-command recognition system. In Batman Returns it is shown to have a secondary mode referred to as the \\"Batmissile\\", where the wheels would retract inward and the sides of the vehicle would break off, converting the car into a thin bullet train-like form capable of squeezing through tight alleyways. Obviously, this secondary mode would require the car to be reassembled and significantly repaired. The Batmobile's shields are made of ceramic fractal armor panels. They explode outward when struck by projectiles, deflecting injurious force away from the car and its occupants. If Batman must leave the Batmobile for an extended period of time, he can, through a voice command spoken into a wrist device (specifically, the word \\"shields\\"), activate the Batmobile's shielding system. This prevents anyone from tampering with the vehicle while it is left unattended. Bulletproof and fireproof steel armor plates envelop the body and cockpit entirely. While this armor is in place, the vehicle cannot be driven. In Batman the shields were not fully functioning. In reality, a life-size model was built, and the shield activation sequence was created with stop motion animation technology. In Batman Returns, the shields held the same characteristics. However, the design was slimmer and the special effects were provided by computer-generated imagery. In shield mode, a small but powerful bomb can be deployed. =Other appearances= *A series of Onstar TV advertisements featured this particular Batmobile being equipped with the system. OnStar allowed Batman to call various Gotham characters, summon police, remotely unlock the vehicle's doors and find the nearest jet fuel station. *This version of the Batmobile was later seen in the Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman episode called \\"Don't Tug on Superman's Cape\\", an episode which shows that some collectors had apparently stolen the Batmobile. *In the movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Daffy Duck drives the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile into the water tower on the Warner Bros. studio lot, causing it to fall over and nearly crush Jenna Elfman's character. *On the TV series Animaniacs, the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile approaches the WB studios front gates, the guard at the door greets the driver by saying \\"Good afternoon Mr. Keaton\\". Another Animaniacs cartoon features a parody of the poem 'Twas the Night Before Christmas. As the WB studios empty out for the Christmas break, the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile pulls up to the gate, and Ralph the Guard waves it through, saying, \\"Goodnight, Mr. Keaton, that's a lovely sedan\\". In a third Animaniacs appearance, Dot Warner's interpretation of a Puck soliloquy from A Midsummer Night's Dream renders the line, \\"And Robin shall make amends ere long\\" as \\"And the Boy Wonder will save us\\". The Tim Burton version of the Batmobile then drives up to the Warner siblings and opens its canopy; Robin pulls the trio into the car, which departs, saving them from an angry fairy. *In the \\"RPM\\" episode of the animated series The Batman, one of Bruce Wayne's Batmobile prototypes is the Batmobile from the Tim Burton films. *In the animated film Batman: Gotham Knight segment \\"Working Through Pain\\", Alfred uses the 1989 Batmobile to pull the sewer gate to rescue Batman trapped underneath. *In the Arrowverse crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", the Tim Burton version of the Batmobile makes a brief appeearence in the Earth-99 Batcave. =Replicas= * The only actual turbine powered Batmobile in existence is a replica of the 1989 film car. It is powered by a military Boeing turboshaft engine driving the rear wheels through a 4 speed semi-automatic transmission and is street registered. This car was designed and constructed by Casey Putsch of Putsch Racing in 2011. * In Pune, India, a replica of the car was spotted in June 2015. * Replicas of the Tim Burton-era Batmobiles are on display in front of several Batman: The Ride roller coasters and also in the street near Batman Adventure – The Ride 2 at Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia. * Historic auto attractions in Roscoe, Illinois displays a replica Batmobile from Batman Returns as well as the \\"Batmissile\\" in addition to a replica of the Batmobile from the 1960s television series. * A replica was spotted at Al Barsha area of Dubai, United Arab Emirates on October 2020. It had very strange kind of controls and dashboard. Batman Forever The Batmobile from Batman Forever (1995) As the Batman films were handed over to director Joel Schumacher from Tim Burton, the design for the Batmobile was updated. Tim Flattery drew the winning design. Decorative lighting was added to the vehicle's rims, sides, and front edge, and the wing- shaped fins reached further into the air. The car had a few unique features, such as being able to rotate its wheels through 90 degrees so that it could move in a perpendicular direction, a grappling hook allowing the Batmobile to drive up walls, and the speed to perform large jumps from surface to surface during chases across Gotham City's elevated freeways and gigantic statues. The Batman Forever Batmobile's ability to drive up walls was displayed as Batman eludes a dead end provided by Two-Face and his henchmen. Later in the film, Dick Grayson takes the Batmobile for a joy ride without Batman's permission or awareness. Ultimately, it was destroyed when the Riddler deposited a sack full of explosives in the cockpit. Batman Forever is also notable for the phrase uttered by Batman to Dr. Chase Meridian \\"It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.\\" The design of the Batmobiles of the Schumacher films have garnered criticism for allegedly resembling giant phalli. =Technical specifications= The Batman Forever Batmobile had a Chevrolet 350 ZZ3 high- performance motor. The body is made from a high-temperature epoxy fiberglass laminate. The wheelbase is 118 in. (), the average car wheelbase measures around 103 (USDOT Data 1980–2000) inches. In all, its size was 300 in long and 126 in high. Carbon fiber was used to build the body of this particular Batmobile. The specifications for the Batmobile in this film are: *Length: 300 in (7.62 m) *Width: 94.4 in *Height: 126 in (3.20 m) *Maximum speed: 330 mph with booster *Engine: 350 hp (est.), 350 cu in ZZ3 Chevrolet V8 engine, automatic transmission, custom front and rear suspension. *Wheelbase: 118 in *Tires: pivotable =Features= The Batmobile depicted in Batman Forever (1995) sought to accentuate its intricate lines. To do this, the filmmakers equipped it with engine panels, wheels, and undercarriage that were indirectly lit so that they appeared to glow blue. The Batman Forever car also had a split cockpit canopy, separate fenders, and jet exhaust. The roof fin could be opened into a \\"V\\" shape for a more contemporary look, though the only time this was shown is during the scene when Dick Grayson is taking the car out for a joyride through the city. The wheels were made to keep the bat emblems upright when the wheels are turning. The bat-emblem on the hubcaps was a counter-rotating gear that transferred into a stationary point. The two-seat cockpit featured a rear-view monitor, system diagnostics display, and custom gauge cluster. H. R. Giger was chosen to design the Batmobile in the very early stages of production. Schumacher's crew were unable to understand how they could construct a functional version. Only two sketches and an early blueprint were completed. There were two primary avoidance/defense features on the Batman Forever version. First, it had the ability to lock all four wheels perpendicular to its centerline, to allow for quick sideways movement. Second, for more dire circumstances, the Batmobile could reroute the jet exhaust to under its front end and launch grappling cables at overhead anchors. With the nose up and the lines in place, the car could climb sheer vertical surfaces like building walls as if it were driving on flat ground. =Other appearances= *In episode 53 of the TV series The Drew Carey Show, Drew Carey won the Batman Forever version of the Batmobile as a prize. Lewis and Oswald take it on a joyride dressed as Batman and Robin without Drew's permission. Oswald was played by Diedrich Bader (Batman's voice in Batman: The Brave and the Bold). *In The New Batman Adventures episode \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\", three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet an effeminate youth named Joel in front of a shoemaker's shop, whose idea of Batman consists mainly of a fascination with the tight rubber suits and a Batmobile that can drive up walls (as seen in Batman Forever). The other three children treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain. *In the 2011 remake of the comedy film Arthur, Arthur (played by Russell Brand) drives the Batman Forever version of the Batmobile. Batman & Robin (1997 film) 205x205px A new Batmobile is seen in the 1997 film Batman & Robin. The last Batmobile to appear in the motion picture series, it was designed by Harald Belker. It is prominently featured in one scene in which, as Batman and Robin are in pursuit, Mr. Freeze shoots the underside of the car for several seconds with freeze-gun, before the car crash-lands. However, in the next scene in the Batcave, the Batmobile is sitting back on its pedestal appearing to be in perfect condition. =Technical specifications= In Batman & Robin, the aerodynamic chassis design and \\"T\\" axis wheelbase provided the Batmobile counterbalance gyrometric stability, allowing for high velocity 90-degree turns at speeds greater than 70 mph without losing momentum. Initial plans had the Batmobile being able to transform into the \\"Bathammer\\" vehicle seen in this film,[A] but were abandoned. The specifications for the Batmobile in this film are as follows: *Length: 396 in () long. The six flame columns formed a V-shaped output of 71 in (1.80 m) length. *Height: 59.05 in (1.5 m) *Maximum Speed: 230 mph on open road, 350 mph with afterburner thrust; TFX road tested the Batmobile at 140 mph. 350 km/h and the additional jet propulsion brings the cars to 530 km/h. *Engine: Chevy 350 ZZ3 (off-road racing motor). Instead of a single jet exhaust, this Batmobile had a \\"boattail\\" rear flanked by separate fenders, each with three smaller exhaust nozzles. *Axle Base: 388 in *Tires: It rode on custom 22\\" wheels with prototype, 55 in GoodYear tires with Batsymbols in the treads. =Features= The second Schumacher era Batmobile featured neither a passenger seat nor a canopy. Like the Batman Forever car, this Batmobile (which was designed by Harald Belker) featured light-up wheels and engine panels. The displays were much more involved with this car, however, with red, orange, yellow, and blue lights, as well as special pulsating lights in the counter-rotating turbine intake. The nozzles were canted away from the centerline of the car slightly, so the final effect was that the six exhausts made a \\"V\\" pattern to keep the car pointed straight ahead. A bat mask was incorporated onto the nose of the car, although the sculpted lines made it somewhat difficult to make out at first. The fins were unmistakable and remain as the largest set ever built into a real-world Batmobile. On the Batman & Robin version the arsenal of weaponry and gadgets is controlled by an onboard voice-activated computer which surrounds the single-seat cockpit. From behind the wheel, the driver has access to a multifunctioning key command response system which delivers immediate weapon activation during attack and defensive procedures. The Batman & Robin version of the Batmobile was equipped with dual-mount, subcarriage rocket launchers, front and rear grappling hooks, multipoint infrared and laser scan tracking units, anterior/posterior wheel- based axle bombs, catapult ejection seat, and disguised central carriage, which detaches to become an emergency road vehicle. The single-seat cockpit featured a two-way videoconferencing screen, radar unit, and Redbird communication switch. The Dark Knight Trilogy The \\"Tumbler\\" Batmobile from The Dark Knight Trilogy The Batmobile depicted in Christopher Nolan's trilogy of Batman films owes much to the tank-like vehicle from Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns; it has a more \\"workhorse\\" appearance than the sleek automobiles seen in previous incarnations, designed more for functionality than intimidation. While the films never refer to the vehicle as the \\"Batmobile\\", it is still referred to as such in the scripts. The film's production designer described the machine as a cross between a Lamborghini and a tank. In Batman Begins (2005), Bruce Wayne utilizes the prototype vehicle known as the Tumbler designed by Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences Division as a bridging vehicle for the military. It includes weaponry and the ability to boost into a rampless jump. The Tumbler's armor is strong enough to break through concrete barriers without sustaining significant damage. Two full- sized driving versions were used in exterior shots while another full-sized model with hydraulic enhancements was used in jump sequences. A further full- sized, functional version carried propane tanks to fuel the rocket blast out of the rear nozzle. A radio controlled, 1/3-scale electric model also performed stunts in the film including the roof-top chase sequence. Six vehicles were built for the production of the film. In The Dark Knight (2008), the Tumbler returns and appears twice in the movie: where Batman captures the Scarecrow, and in a chase where it is damaged by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by the Joker in an attempt to kill Harvey Dent. This causes the Tumbler to crash and Batman to eject from it in the Batpod (a motorcycle formed by the front wheels and struts of the Tumbler) as part of a self-destruct sequence which sees the remainder of the vehicle explode. The Tumbler is also seen in the trailers in a deleted scene, exiting the improvised Batcave. In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), several Tumblers are seen. Each of these vehicles has the Tumbler's original military camouflage and is stolen from Wayne Enterprises by Bane's gang. The stolen Tumblers are used in Bane's attempt to control Gotham and are notably seen when the mass of police and criminals are about to battle. One of the Tumblers fires at the crowd of police, only for the Bat to intercept the shot. Three of the Tumblers are destroyed by Batman using the Bat and Selina Kyle using the Batpod. =Technical specifications= ;Overviewhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T0MRC4PUTY * Length: * Width: * Height: * Weight: * Acceleration: 0–60 mph (0-96.6 km/h) in 5.6 seconds. * Maximum Top Speed: * Maximum Turn Speed: * Maximum Jump Distance: * Engine: 5.7 litre GM V8 engine capable of . * Fuel: The \\"jet engine\\" on the back of the car was fed by propane tanks. * Tires: 4 Interco \\"Super Swamper TSL\\" tires standing 44/18.5-16.5 in the rear, and two 94.0/15.0-15 Hoosier Checkerboard dirt tires on the front, with superior grip. =Features= The Christopher Nolan version of the Batmobile has a pair of autocannons mounted in the nose of the car between the front wheels. In \\"Attack\\" mode, the driver's seat moves to the center of the car, and the driver is repositioned to lie face-down with his head in the center section between the front wheels. This serves two main purposes: first, it provides more substantial protection with the driver shielded by multiple layers of armor plating. Second, the low- down, centralized driving position makes extreme precision maneuvers easier to perform, while lying prone reduces the risk of injury a driver faces when making these maneuvers. Other devices included: *Rear flaps to assist brakes *Dual front autocannons *Rocket launcher *Landing hook to Sprung landing stabilization *Integrated fire-extinguishing system *Integrated safety connection to gasoline control *Jet engine (with afterburners) on back of car for quick boosts/\\"rampless\\" jumps *Stealth mode avoids detection using a variety of stealth technologies that reduce reflection/emission of radar, infrared, visible light, radio-frequency (RF) spectrum, and audio; the car's lights and main engine are deactivated; the vehicle is powered by an auxiliary electric motor. This makes the car very hard to find at night or in dark places, and as demonstrated by the car chase in Batman Begins, can easily throw off pursuers. *Explosive caltrops are deployed from the rear of the vehicle, which can impair any vehicles that make contact with them. *Front of car is heavily armored, so the car can ram as a practical offensive attack, and also protects the driver while in the prone driving position/\\"Attack\\" mode *Both front wheels can eject when the vehicle is damaged to form the Batpod, a motorcycle-like vehicle (the rest self-destructs). *The new Tumblers are modified with experimental weapons: ** A set of missile launchers ** A retractable artillery cannon on a turret =Production process= The new incarnation of the Tumbler was proposed by Nolan after he built a proof-of- concept model design out of Play-Doh - a model he admitted looked \\"very very crude, more like a croissant than a car\\". Nathan Crowley, one of the production designers for Batman Begins, then started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing based on that shape. One of the parts that Crowley used to create the vehicle was the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the car's jet engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Andy Smith, carved a full-size replica of the vehicle out of a large block of Styrofoam, which was a process that lasted two months. The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel \\"test frame\\", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over 100 mph, go from 0 to in 5 seconds, possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners, and to withstand a self-propelled launch of up to . On the first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed vehicle included a 5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear axle, front racing tires by Hoosier, rear 4×4 mud tires by Interco., and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars. With the design process completed, four street-ready cars were constructed. Each vehicle possessed 65 carbon fiber panels and cost $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. Due to the poor visibility inside the vehicle by the driver, monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes. The interior was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable version. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the car was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the full-sized one. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show it flying across ravines and between buildings. However, a full-size car was used for the waterfall sequence. The scale model scenes were filmed on a massive set built on a stage at Shepperton Studios in England over the course of nine weeks. The full-sized vehicles were driven and filmed on the streets of Chicago. In The Dark Knight, the Batpod ejects from the Tumbler, with the Tumbler's front wheels as the Batpod's wheels; this was rendered using computer-generated imagery when attempts to achieve the separation through practical effects proved impossible. DC Extended Universe The Batmobile in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) According to the Warner Bros. Studios lot, the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Batmobile combined inspiration from both the sleek, streamlined design of classic Batmobiles and the high-suspension, military build from the more recent Tumbler from The Dark Knight Trilogy. They were also inspired by the 1989 Batmobile. Designed by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos and Dennis McCarthy, the Batmobile is about 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. Unlike previous Batmobiles, it has a gatling gun sitting on the front and the back tires are shaved down tractor tires. The Batmobile elevates itself for scenes depicting it going into battle or when performing jumps, and lowers to the ground when cruising through the streets. The Batmobile appears in a flashback for Suicide Squad, when Batman was pursuing the Joker and Harley Quinn before their car crashed into the river, the Joker escaping while Harley was captured. In the 2017 film Justice League, Batman owns a new four- legged tank-vehicle called the \\"Knightcrawler\\", which was designed by his father during World War II. The Crawler is used in the fight against Steppenwolf to rescue Star Labs scientists (including Cyborg's father Dr. Silas Stone) underneath an abandoned Gotham Harbor. Near the end, the new team board the portable troop carrier aka \\"Flying Fox\\" carrying the new armored Batmobile to battle Steppenwolf in Poznarhov, Russia. =Technical specifications= ;OVERVIEWhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpDs0si5oaA Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \\"Creating Batmobile\\" Featurette (2016) * Length: * Width: * Height: * Weight: 7,000 lbs * Acceleration: Unknown * Maximum Top Speed: * Maximum Turn Speed: * Maximum Jump Distance: * Engine: Unknown * Fuel: Unknown * Tires: 500lbsx4 * Suspension: One-off airbag over a bypass shock system ;ARSENAL *Grappling Hook, Countermeasures, Machine Gun. *Twin .50 caliber machine guns *Fully armored *Stealth-capable *Active Protection Systems / Anti-ballistics *8500 lbs. *BVS-20418-CC 900 55e9de20f38270.44527475 ;DEFENSE SYSTEMS *Electrified skin deterrent *Concealment smoke grenade launcher system *Antiroll system *Shield generator housing *Jamming signals system *Sensor assembly *Laser tracking assembly *Ballistic missile defense system *Electromagnetic pulse protection *Grapple hook compartment *Canopy ;MODIFICATIONS *Vaporized kryptonite *Infused kryptonite skin coating *Direct kryptonite vapor trajectory system *Kryptonite transit wave emitter *Class 4 cell krip (modified secondary weapons bay) ;ARMAMENT SYSTEMS *Heat ray crowd control dispersal cannon *Main weapons bay *Sound compliance non-lethal system *Xenon stun/spot searchlights *Secondary weapons bay *12.7 X 108 mm anti-material weapon *Anti-material missile weapon *19 Cow catcher ;MISCELLANEOUS COMPONENT AND SYSTEMS *Thrust vent (forward) *Electronic stabilization *Nitro-methane tank *Immobilizer *Muffler bearings *Turbo-thrust kinetic ion pulse drives *Turbine *Dogleg gearbox *Secondary nitro-methane tank *Helicopter lifting hooks *Exhaust ports *Air-to-ground refueling (AGR) *Gyro stabilization assembly (for the .50 caliber machine gun) ;TIRES *Front: 400/55-225(tractor tires).Kevlar reinforced belted type IV armor *Rear: 700/50-225(tractor tires).Kevlar reinforced belted type IV armor =Features= The Batmobile in Suicide Squad (2016) The Batmobile is an armored tactical assault vehicle that has the ability to raise or lower its suspension, depending on its combat or navigational situations. It also has a miniature jet engine afterburner to provide a quick thrust in pursuits and jumps. The exterior body is completely bulletproof and can easily withstand sustained gunfire from miniguns. The Batmobile is measured at 20 ft. (6.1 meters) long and 12 ft. (3.7 meters) wide at the rear. The vehicle and is estimated to reach up to 205 mph. Weighing in at 7,000 lbs, overpowered with an unmatched hybrid of prototype military and civilian performance technologies. Estimated to reach speeds of up to 205 mph (92 m/s). The Batmobile’s imposing defense capabilities, supported by Wayne Enterprises technologies, have been integrated with the latest in covert military grade armaments, stealth and active protection systems. The interior and controls are modeled after aircraft fighter cockpit, promoting utilitarian function over aesthetic design, with a number of buttons and switches available to toggle the many functions of the vehicle. The passenger side is retrofitted to function as a miniature armory, storing backup grapple guns, batarangs, smoke grenades, and a grenade launcher. The Batmobile is equipped with a gimbal- mounted machine gun on its front section and a harpoon launcher in the rear, capable of dragging a truck behind it with ease. It is also equipped with missile racks and flare countermeasures to counter incoming homing missiles. The Batmobile is also capable of autonomous control, should Batman ever need to leave the Batmobile. An electric current runs along the vehicle's exterior plating, able to shock and incapacitate those unlucky enough to get too close.  The Batman (2021)  The Batmans director Matt Reeves tweeted photos of the Batmobile for the film as a muscle car. Ready Player One The 60s incarnation of the Batmobile appears in the Steven Spielberg 2018 film Ready Player One, based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline. Appearing as part of a race alongside many famous vehicles from pop culture, the Batmobile is destroyed when it is struck by another vehicle and explodes. =Video games= * In the Sega CD adaptation of Batman Returns, the Batmobile was controlled during the time bonus stages after missions were completed. *There are two Batmobile levels in the 2005 video game adaptation of Batman Begins. Electronic Arts used the Burnout 3: Takedown engine for these levels. Batman has to ram enemy cars off the road which results in a \\"Take down\\" while picking up Nitro boosts along the way that float on the road in holographic bubbles. Xbox World Australia called these sequences the highlight of the game. Cheatcc.com called them \\"by far the best Batmobile levels ever featured in a game\\". *In the PlayStation game Batman: Gotham City Racer, the player gets the full independence to drive the Batmobile. *In DC Universe Online, during the \\"Batcave: Inner Sanctum\\" alert/raid, the Batmobile is destroyed by the Armored Robotic Custodian, a sentinel robot that has been taken over by Brainiac. *In Injustice: Gods Among Us, Batmobile appears at the end of Batman's Super Move, ramming his opponent. **In the mobile version, in addition to its appearance in the Super Move, the Batmobile (and the evolved form, Militarized Batmobile) can be obtained as a gear card, granting its user increased health; if equipped by a Batman character, it additionally grants his Super Move increased damage, area effect damage, and invulnerability after using it. *The 2013 Batman arcade game is based around the Batmobile, with players controlling it in vehicular combat missions. Ten different Batmobile designs are available for play, including the designs from the 1960s television series, The Animated Series, The Brave and the Bold, Arkham Asylum, and every Batman film up to and including The Dark Knight Rises. *On February 25, 2016, it was confirmed via Twitter that the 2015 game Rocket League would be receiving a Batmobile car pack on March 8, 2016 to coincide with the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Batman: Arkham series In Batman: Arkham Asylum, a version of the Batmobile appears with a design heavily influenced by the one used in Batman (1989 film) and Batman: The Animated Series. In the game, it is vandalized by Harley Quinn and the Blackgate prisoners. Batman later controls the Batmobile remotely using his utility belt to take Bane into the sea along with it. In Batman: Arkham City, the Batmobile appears in the Batcave Predator Challenge Map and was back under re-construction following its tussle with Bane, thus explaining its absence in the rest of the game. In Batman: Arkham Origins, a prototype of the Batmobile was seen in the Batcave and was under construction by Batman, under the working title \\"Urban Assault Vehicle\\" and when scanned in Detective Mode its description: \\"Armored to resist direct collisions and small arms fire. Multiple LTL armaments. Shield tracking profiles reduced thermal/radar footprint. 1.200BHP. 7MPG. Status: Under Maintenance.\\" After Bane destroyed the Batcave, the prototype fell off the ledge, destroyed, with Alfred under the rubble. The destroyed remains of that early Batmobile could still be seen on the ledge. In Batman: Arkham Knight, a different version of the Batmobile—Urban Assault Vehicle—retains its classic-shape and designs; but is heavily influenced by the ones used in The Dark Knight Trilogy. The car is an off-road vehicle, highly maneuverable, possessed numerous non-lethal deterrents, heavier than a light tank, the ability to absorb impact makes it nearly indestructible, and affected anything it collided with in similar fashion. It can be called to Batman instantly with the press of a button and can eject Batman hundreds of feet in the air to instantly begin gliding. Batman can also control the Batmobile remotely using his Batmobile Remote gadget and it can even support Batman while he is fighting free flow combat via a Batmobile assisted Special Takedown. Like the Batsuit and gadgets, the Batmobile can be upgraded and even has its own alternate skins (such as one based on the Batmobile from 1960 TV series). The game also features Batmobiles from other Batman media that appear as DLC and are used in the main game upon the main story's completion as well as in special Racing AR Challenges. =Technical specifications= The Arkham Knight Batmobile—Urban Assault Vehicle—has a \\"Reconfigurable Embedded System\\", featuring two modes between which it can transform: pursuit mode and battle mode. Pursuit Mode is the default Pursuit and Capture form used for driving around the city and tackling race tracks that the Riddler has set up. It contains boost and jump mechanisms, non-lethal missiles used to immobilize getaway vehicles and an EMP taser unit to stun criminals and enemy vehicles. ;Overview * Manufacturer: Wayne Enterprises Applied Sciences Division * Production: 2 built * Designer: German automaker Zimmer ;Body and chassis * Class: Reconfigurable Embedded System / Urban Assault Vehicle / Multiple LTL armaments * Body style: 1-door sliding canopy * Layout: Mid-engine, all-wheel-drive * Stealth: Shield tracking profiles reduced thermal/radar footprint ;Powertrain * Hybrid: 1,200 bhp WayneTech power cell / Honeywell AGT1500C multi-fuel jet turbine * Engine: quad-turbocharged * Torque: 1750 lbf.ft at 98.7% ROS * Power output: * Operational range: – * Fuel efficiency: 205 mpg (energy equivalency) * Transmission: 7-speed dual-clutch in 9.7 seconds @ over ;Dimensions * Wheelbase diameter: * Ground clearance: * Length: * Width: [widened profile in combat mode] * Height: [raised profile in combat mode] * Curb weight: ;Performance * Acceleration: in 2.7 seconds; * Top Speed: [without afterburner] * Turn Speed: * Jump Distance: ;Afterburner * Top Speed: raises maximum speed threshold(s) by 30% * Fuel type: Nitro methane * Temperature at vent: 1100 °C ;Cockpit * Driver: Electromagnetic ejector seat * Batcomputer: Enhanced intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities * Navigation: Artificial intelligence and remote guidance systems ;Containment Unit * Purpose: Passenger transport * Space: 3 Seats * Blast resistance: Resistant to kinetic forces exceeding 4,500 lb/sq in ;Steering and Breaking System * Air Brakes: Regenerative energy mechanism * Materials: Graphene composite * Actuator: High speed hydraulic cylinder * Stopping distance reduction: 78% Battle Mode transforms the Batmobile's appearance into an off-road tank-like armored Tactical Assault form; capable of raising/lowering/widening its suspension, wheelbase and axle track, depending on its combat or navigational situations. This provides a wider, more stable footprint and increased maneuverability thanks to individually articulated wheels with 360° of lateral spin. Its LED headlights alternates from blue to red. In battle mode a remote controlled turret rises from the top of the vehicle with an array of weapons for anti- armor, anti-air and non-lethal anti-personnel. ;Armor Plating *Thickness: 120mm at thickest point; Explosive reactive armor around cockpit *Material: Carbon nanotube aggregate *Blast resistance: 10 tons per square inch of force *Purpose: Resistance direct collisions and small arms fire ;M61 Vulcan Close- in Weapon System *Rotary cannon: six-barrel, air-cooled, electrically fired Gatling-style *Ammunition gauge: 25mm caliber *Fire rate: 6,000 rounds per minute *Length: 1.8 meters *Purpose: Anti-tank, anti-missile and surface to air combat ;60mm Direct-Fire Cannon *Ammunition type: 60mm high explosive anti-tank penetrator shells *Muzzle velocity: 1,680 meters per second *Armor Penetration: Estimated to penetrate 820 mm of steel armor at point blank range ;Riot Suppressor *Ammunition: Non-lethal slam rounds *Slam rounds: Flexible plastic casing filled with 50 grams of rubber pellets *Purpose: Designed to deliver minimum long-term trauma & render combatant immobile ;Electroshock Defense *Voltage: 200 - 300 kv range *Delivery: Front and rear conductor rods *Purpose: Propel combatant and disable vehicles ;Gyroscopic Wheels *Suspension: Hydraulic arm-mounted wheel hub motor *Powertrain: H-drive capable of 360 lateral spin for combat maneuvering *Material: Advanced tweel bullet resistant synthetic fibre composite *Purpose: Synthetic composite all terrain traction technology ;Winch *Purpose: Multipurpose grapple claw *Range: 60m *Weight supported: 2.2 t ;Immobilizer Missiles *Payload: 5gm high explosive cl-20/hmx cocrystal *Warhead: 2.75 in (70 mm) *Guidance: Laser/infrared homing =Features= The driver is positioned centered—faced down; this position offers greater protection to the driver during combat, while reducing any chance of injury whenever Batman uses the ejection seat. The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, sent to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City. Some enemies will run away at the sight of the vehicle, eliminating the need for Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses. Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities. The Batwing is used in conjunction with the Batmobile to deliver upgrades, while providing real-time surveillance and close air support. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile's scanner. The Batmobile has two modes, which can be switched at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor. Additional upgrades to the vehicle include an EMP device, which releases an electric pulse used to temporarily stun enemy drones; and the \\"drone virus\\", which allows the player to override the weapon systems of enemy vehicles and cause them to attack each other. The Batmobile can also be controlled remotely, driven in indoor locations, and used in solving the game's puzzles, such as lowering an inaccessible elevator with its attached winch. =Toys= *Hot Wheels released a version of the 1960s Batman TV show's Batmobile, as well as the Batmobile from Batman and Batman Returns, the Tumbler from Nolan's Batman films, and the ones from Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, Batman the Brave and the Bold, The Batman, Batman the Animated Series, Arkham Asylum, Arkham Knight, Batman Live and some original Hot Wheels' Batmobiles. *Corgi Toys of England has produced a wide range of Batmobiles ranging from the original sedan to the latest movie Batmobiles.

She was converted from a British-built blockade runner named Fingal by the Confederacy after she made one run to Savannah, Georgia. After several failed attempts to attack Union blockaders, the ship was captured by two Union monitors in 1863 when she ran aground. Atlanta was floated off, repaired, and rearmed, serving in the Union Navy for the rest of the war. She spent most of her time deployed on the James River supporting Union forces there. The ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in reserve. Several years after the end of the war, Atlanta was sold to Haiti, but was lost at sea in December 1869 on her delivery voyage. Description and career as Fingal Fingal was designed and built as a merchantman by J&G; Thomson's Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard at Govan in Glasgow, Scotland, and was completed early in 1861. She was described by Midshipman Dabney Scales, who served on the Atlanta before her battle with the monitors, as being a two- masted, iron-hulled ship long with a beam of . She had a draft of and a depth of hold of . He estimated her tonnage at around 700 tons bm. Fingal was equipped with two vertical single-cylinder direct-acting steam engines using steam generated by one flue-tubular boiler. The engines drove the ship at a top speed of around . They had a bore of and a stroke of .Emerson, pp. 368, 371, 377 The ship briefly operated between Glasgow and other ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service before she was purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, and Major Edward Clifford Anderson Confederate Secretary of War in England, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that they purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched a letter to his financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not afford to take the time to deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained.Bullock, pp. 110–15 The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.Scharf, pp. 639–40 While Fingal was discharging her cargo, Bulloch and Anderson went to Richmond to confer with Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Navy. Mallory endorsed Bulloch's plan to load Fingal with cotton to sell on the Navy Department's account to be used to purchase more ships and equipment in Europe.Wise, p. 56 He returned to Savannah on 23 November and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal. He made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 December, but it proved impossible to do as the Union controlled every channel from Savannah, aided by their occupation of Tybee Island at the mouth of the Savannah River. Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to Europe some other way.Scharf, pp. 640–41 As Atlanta Cross-section of Atlanta The brothers Asa and Nelson Tift received the contract to convert the blockade runner into an ironclad in early 1862 with the name of Atlanta, after the city in Georgia. This was largely financed by contributions from the women of Savannah. Fingal was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were built out from the sides of her hull to support her casemate.Emerson, p. 373 After the conversion, Atlanta was long overall and had a beam of .Silverstone, p. 151 Her depth of hold was now and she now had a draft of . Atlanta now displaced and her speed was estimated at .Emerson, p. 377 The armor of the casemate was angled at 30° from the horizontal and made from two layers of railroad rails, rolled into plates thick and wide. The outer layer ran vertically and the inner layer horizontally. Her armor was backed by of oak, vertically oriented, and two layers of of pine, alternating in direction. The bottom of the casemate was some from the waterline and its top was above the waterline. The pyramidal pilothouse was armored in the same way and had room for two men. The upper portion of Atlantas hull received of armor.Emerson, pp. 371–372, 382 One of Atlantas 7-inch Brooke rifles in the Washington Navy Yard The rectangular casemate was pierced with eight narrow gun ports, one each at the bow and stern and three along each side. Each gun port was protected by an armored shutter made of two layers of iron riveted together and allowed the guns to elevate only to a maximum of +5 to +7°. Atlanta was armed with single-banded, Brooke rifles on pivot mounts at the bow and stern.Emerson, p. 372 The middle gun port on each side was occupied by a single-banded, Brooke rifle. The 17-caliber, seven-inch guns weighed about and fired armor-piercing \\"bolts\\" and explosive shells. The equivalent statistics for the 18.5-caliber, 6.4-inch gun were with 80-pound bolts and shells.Olmsted, et al., pp. 126–127, 218, 224 Atlanta was also armed with a , solid iron, ram that was reinforced by a series of vertical steel bars. In front of the ram was a spar torpedo that carried of black powder on a wooden pole connected to an iron lever that could be raised or lowered by means of pulleys.Emerson, p. 375 Midshipman and Acting Master's Mate Frank Beville of the Atlanta in uniform On 31 July 1862, under the command of Lieutenant Charles H. McBlair, Atlanta conducted her sea trials down the Savannah River toward Fort Pulaski.Scharf, pp. 641–42 The ship proved to be difficult to steer, and the additional weight of her armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft. This latter was a real problem in the shallow waters near Savannah. She also leaked significantly, and her design virtually eliminated air circulation. One report said that \\"it was almost intolerable on board the Atlanta, there being no method of ventilation, and the heat was intense.\\" Scales commented in his diary, \\"What a comfortless, infernal and God-forsaken ship!!\\" Attempts were made to fix the problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks.Emerson, pp. 371–71 The ship was commissioned on 22 November and became the flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived before the end of January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.Still, pp. 130–135 Webb demonstrated his aggressiveness when he attempted to sortie on the first spring tide (30 May) after taking command, but Atlantas forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions, and the ship ran aground. She was not damaged although it took over a day to pull her free. He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide, rejecting Mallory's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad Savannah was finished before his next sortie. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, had ordered the monitors Weehawken and Nahant into Wassaw Sound. Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the two ships.Still, pp. 135–136 A drawing of USS Weehawken capturing Atlanta, 17 June 1863 In the early evening of 15 June, Webb began his next attempt by passing over the lower obstructions in the Wilmington River and spent the rest of the night coaling. He moved forward the next evening to a concealed position within easy reach of the monitors for an attack early the following morning. Webb planned to sink one of the monitors with his spar torpedo and then deal with the other one with his guns.Still, p. 136 The gunboat Isondiga and the tugboat Resolute were to accompany him to tow one or both of the monitors back to Savannah.Emerson, p. 381 A lookout aboard Weehawken spotted Atlanta at 04:10 on the morning of 17 June. When the latter ship closed to within about of the two Union ships, she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over Weehawken and landed near Nahant. Shortly afterward, Atlanta ran aground on a sandbar; she was briefly able to free herself, but the pressure of the tide pushed her back onto the sandbar. This time Webb was unable to get off and the monitors closed the range. When Weehawken, the leading ship, closed to within she opened fire with both of her guns. The shell missed, but the shell struck the ironclad above the port middle gun port, penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it, spraying splinters and fragments that disabled the entire gun crew and half the crew of the bow gun, even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through the backing. The next shot from the 11-inch Dahlgren gun struck the upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate the two-inch armor there. The next shell from the 15-inch Dahlgren glanced off the middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened, wounding half the gun's crew with fragments. The final shell was also from the 15-inch Dahlgren and it struck the top of the pilothouse, breaking the armor there and wounding both pilots in it. By this time, Atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots, none of which hit either Union ship, and was hard aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half. Weehawken and Nahant were able to freely maneuver into positions from which the Atlantas narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance futile. Webb surrendered his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire, before Nahant even had a chance to fire. Of the ironclad's 21 officers and 124 enlisted men, one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization.Emerson, pp. 381–382; Still, pp. 136–137 In the Union Navy USS Atlanta on the James River; photo by Mathew Brady Atlanta was easily pulled free by the Union ships and she reached Port Royal under her own power. Not badly damaged, she was repaired and bought by the Union Navy. The prize money of $350,000 was shared between the crews of Weehawken, Nahant and the gunboat , the only ships within signaling distance. The ship retained her name and was commissioned again on 2 February 1864, rearmed with a pair of , 150-pound Parrott rifles in the bow and stern and 6.4-inch, 100-pound Parrott rifles amidships.Emerson, pp. 382, 384 The 150-pound Parrott rifle weighed and was 17 calibers long. The 100-pounder weighed and was 20 calibers long. It fired a shell a distance of at an elevation of +25°. All four of her Brooke rifles are currently located in Willard Park in the Washington Navy Yard.Olmsted, et al., pp. 117–18, 218, 224 Atlanta was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and spent most of her time stationed up the James River where she could support operations against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the ironclads of the James River Squadron. On 21 May 1864, she and the gunboat fired on and dispersed Confederate cavalry that was attacking Fort Powhatan and she was deployed further upriver in February 1865 after the Battle of Trent's Reach to better blockade the Confederate ironclads at Richmond.Still, p. 186 After the end of the war in April, Atlanta was decommissioned in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 and placed in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer who had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled in a civil war. Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.Holcombe & SilverstoneScheina, p. 39 See also * Blockade runners of the American Civil War *Bibliography of American Civil War naval history References  Bibliography  *Anderson, Edward Clifford, Afloat and Ashore: The Confederate Diary of Colonel Edward Clifford Anderson, University of Alabama Press, 1977    Further reading *Bibliography of Civil War naval history External links *Various photos and drawings of Atlanta *List of prisoners from the CSS Atlanta on June 17, 1863 *\\"Rebel Ram 'Atlanta'\\" at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania Category:Steamships of the United States Navy Category:Ironclad warships of the Union Navy Category:Ironclad warships of the Confederate States Navy Category:Shipwrecks of the Carolina coast Category:Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War Category:United States Navy Georgia-related ships Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1861 ships Category:Maritime incidents in June 1863 Category:Maritime incidents in December 1869 Category:Vessels captured by the United States Navy Category:Blockade runners of the American Civil War Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Haitian Navy ","title":"USS Atlanta (1861)"},{"id":"914153","text":"Alexandra Fouace (born 7 July 1979) is a French athlete who competed in archery at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics.Olympic results In 2004, she was 30th in the women's individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 627.

Biography Yang Chengfu was born into the famous Yang Taijiquan family, the son of Yang Chien-hou and grandson of Yang Luchan. With his older brother Yang Shao-hou (楊少侯) and colleagues Wu Jianquan (吳鑑泉) and Sun Lutang (孫錄堂), he was among the first teachers to offer T'ai chi ch'uan instruction to the general public at the Beijing Physical Culture Research Institute from 1914 until 1928. He moved to Shanghai in 1928. Chengfu is known for having \\"smoothed\\" out the somewhat more vigorous training routine he learned from his family as well as emphasising a \\"large frame\\" or \\"Da Jia (大架)\\" with expansive movements in stepping and using large circular motions with the arms. His smooth, evenly paced large frame form and its hundreds of offshoots has been the standard for Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan (and overwhelmingly in the public imagination for T'ai chi ch'uan in general) ever since. Chengfu is the official author of two books on the style, Application methods of Taijiquan, published in 1931, and Essence and Applications of Taijiquan (Taijiquan Tiyong Quanshu), published in 1934. His second book was translated into English in 2005. Students and Descendants His direct descendants, the many students he taught, and their students, have spread the art around the world. Among Yang Chengfu's students were famous masters such as Tung Ying-chieh (Dong Yingjie, 董英杰; 1898–1961), Chen Weiming, Fu Zhongwen (Fu Chung-wen, 1903–1994), Li Yaxuan (李雅轩; 1894–1976) and Cheng Man-ch'ing. Each of them taught extensively, founding groups teaching T'ai chi to this day. Cheng Man-ch'ing, perhaps the most famous outside of China, significantly shortened and simplified the traditional forms Yang taught him after his teacher's passing, reportedly to make them more accessible to larger numbers of students. Although Cheng's modifications are considered controversial by most other schools and are not recognized by the Yang family, Cheng Man-ch'ing is known as one of the first to teach T'ai chi ch'uan in the West. His sons have continued to teach their father's Taijiquan, including his first son, the late Yang Zhenming (1910–1985) (a.k.a. Yang Shaozhong, Yang Shou-Chung, Yeung Shao-Chung; 楊守中), who brought Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan to Hong Kong, his second son Yang Zhenji (born 1921, current head of the family), his third son, Yang Zhenduo (楊振鐸; born 1926), living in Shanxi Province, who is widely considered the most prominent of the Yang family T'ai chi ch'uan instructors living today, and his fourth son, Yang Zhen Guo, born in 1928, and living in Hebei Province, Handan City.

A small, incised alluvial plain from Red Rock Canyon State Park (California). An alluvial plain is a largely flat landform created by the deposition of sediment over a long period of time by one or more rivers coming from highland regions, from which alluvial soil forms. A floodplain is part of the process, being the smaller area over which the rivers flood at a particular period of time, whereas the alluvial plain is the larger area representing the region over which the floodplains have shifted over geological time. As the highlands erode due to weathering and water flow, the sediment from the hills is transported to the lower plain. Various creeks will carry the water further to a river, lake, bay, or ocean. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the floodplain of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will, over time, seek new, lower paths, forming a meander (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses. These processes, over geologic time, will form the plain, a region with little relief (local changes in elevation), yet with a constant but small slope. The Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms, maintained by the United States' National Cooperative Soil Survey, defines an \\"alluvial plain\\" as \\"a large assemblage of fluvial landforms (braided streams, terraces, etc.,) that form low gradient, regional ramps along the flanks of mountains and extend great distances from their sources (e.g., High Plains of North America)\\" Use of \\"alluvial plain\\" as a general, informal term for a broad flood plain or a low- gradient delta is explicitly discouraged.

It is the personal residence of Bruce Wayne, who is also the superhero Batman. The residence is depicted as a large mansion on the outskirts of Gotham City and is maintained by the Wayne family's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. While the earliest stories showed Bruce Wayne buying the house himself, by the 1950s at the latest, retroactive continuity established that the manor had belonged to the Wayne family for several generations. Along with serving as a personal residence, the mansion sits above the Batcave, which Batman uses as his secret headquarters. The vast majority of DC Comics references place Wayne Manor just outside of Gotham City in the state of New Jersey.Amazing World of DC Comics #14, March 1974. DC Comics.World's Finest Comics #259, October–November 1979. DC Comics.Detective Comics #503 June 1983. DC Comics.Atlas of the DC Universe, 1990. DC Comics. The manor acts as a home base and representation of Bruce's old wealth life, despite matching the Gothic architecture present in Gotham. For live-action films, English country house locations in Nottinghamshire, Hertfordshire, and Buckinghamshire, as well as Stevenson Taylor Hall in New York, have been used to depict Wayne Manor. Mansion grounds Wayne Manor with Gotham City in the distance from Detective Comics #967 (December 2017). Art by Álvaro Martínez and Raúl Fernández. Wayne Manor is depicted in earlier comics as being on the outskirts of Gotham City in the state of New Jersey. Comic book portrayals place the mansion within driving distance of Gotham City, close enough that the batsignal can be seen from Wayne Manor alerting Batman of distress in the city. Wayne Manor's grounds include a surrounding gate around the perimeter with a larger front gate at the main entrance. Batman's subterranean headquarters, the Batcave, is located beneath the mansion. The grounds also includes a large hill that was partially hollowed out for Batman's aerial vehicles, with the most prominent being the batcave, and there is also an underground river system that is large enough to accommodate docking space for the Batboat and has a large opening for said vehicle. Access to the Batcave The manor grounds include an extensive cave system that Bruce Wayne discovered as a boy and later used as his base of operations, the Batcave. The method used to access it from inside the mansion has varied across the different storylines in the comics, movies, and shows. In the comic books, it is typically accessible from a hidden door in Wayne Manor's study behind a non-functioning grandfather clock, which opens to a descending staircase when the hands on said clock are turned to 10:47, the time Thomas and Martha Wayne were killed. Wayne Manor with its surrounding gate in Batman vol. 3, #42 (May 2017). Art by Mikel Janín. The Batcave is accessible from outside the mansion through a hidden entrance on the estate's grounds. This entrance leads directly to the Batcave and has been depicted in different forms, including a waterfall, pond, hologram, and camouflaged door. The Wayne Foundation Penthouse era While these grounds are the regular home of Bruce Wayne, he temporarily vacated it in the stories from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, preferring to live in a penthouse apartment on top of the Wayne Foundation building in the city, which also included a secret sub-basement acting as a Batcave. Wayne came to this decision when Dick Grayson went off to college, which led him to decide that the mansion was now impractical with only one resident and one servant. Furthermore, Wayne decided he wanted to be closer to his main field of operations in Gotham City than a home situated outside the main urban area would allow. However, by the early 1980s, Wayne came to reconsider that purpose and decided that being less accessible to the public was more advantageous for his Batman activities and returned to Wayne Manor. Following the events of Cataclysm During the events of Batman: Cataclysm a massive earthquake struck Gotham City, the epicenter of which was less than a mile from Wayne Manor. The mansion was seriously damaged, as was the cave network beneath. The ground beneath the mansion shifted significantly, and actually revealed the Batcave below, although the Bat-family were able to relocate all of Batman's equipment before official rescue came to the manor so that nobody would learn Bruce Wayne's secrets. The original Manor was damaged beyond repair, forcing Bruce Wayne to redesign the Manor along with the Batcave. The new Manor is a veritable fortress, a pastiche of Gothic architecture combined with features of castellated architecture. Solar panels are installed in the new Manor, providing environmentally-friendly electricity generation for the complex.Batman: The Ultimate Guide to The Dark Knight It also includes a heliport for commercial helicopters.Batman: Gotham Knights #1 Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne In Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne it is revealed that Wayne Manor was designed by Nathan Van Derm for Darius Wayne, forming a stylized \\"W\\", although the additional gardens that existed at the time the manor was built add on to this symbol to create the image of a bat. Batman Eternal/Arkham Manor During Batman Eternal, Hush's machinations result in Wayne Enterprises being ruined and Bruce Wayne essentially bankrupt after the villain detonates various weapons caches Batman had concealed around Gotham.Batman Eternal #37 As part of this bankruptcy, Wayne Manor is repossessed by the city and turned into the new Arkham Asylum following the destruction of the original,Arkham Manor #1 but Bruce decides to accept this new status quo, reasoning that he can at least make sure that his enemies remain contained in the new manor given his intimate knowledge of its entrances and exits.Arkham Manor #6 The manor is eventually reclaimed by Bruce's lawyers, but it is temporarily left empty due to Bruce's death and amnesic resurrection as Alfred wanted to give Bruce a chance to have a life without Batman. However, Bruce returns to the manor when he realizes who he used to be. Other versions Wayne Manor in Batman and the Outsiders vol. 2, #13 (Jan. 2009). Art by Fernando Dagnino. =Vampire Batman= In Batman & Dracula: Red Rain, Wayne Manor is destroyed as part of a plan to destroy Dracula's vampire family, bombs exposing the interior of the Batcave to sunlight after Batman lured the vampires into the cave following a chase through Gotham's sewers that ended in the Batcave just as the sun rose. Although the manor collapses into the cavern system after a second series of bombs are set off, thus concealing Bruce Wayne's secret, Batman and Alfred relocate to a brownstone in the center of town, Batman residing in a mausoleum in the basement while Alfred prepares his equipment in the main house. Although Alfred and Gordon stake Batman at the conclusion of Batman: Bloodstorm after he succumbs to his vampire instincts and drinks the Joker's blood, he is restored to life after Alfred removes the stake in Crimson Mist, subsequently relocating to the catacombs underneath the remains of Wayne Manor. The manor's remains are finally destroyed for good when Gordon, Alfred, Two-Face, Killer Croc, and Two-Face's gang plant bombs on the cave roof, exposing the interior to sunlight and ending Batman's reign of terror once and for all. =Kingdom Come= In Kingdom Come, the Manor was mostly destroyed by Two-Face and Bane after Batman's true identity was exposed; the Batcave, however, remained relatively untouched. By the end of the graphic novel, the Manor has been rebuilt as a hospital/hospice for Gulag battle victims. In other media =TV series= Batman In the 1960s live action series, the exteriors were shot in Pasadena, California, at 380 South San Rafael Avenue (), about a mile (1.6 km) south of the Rose Bowl stadium. The Bat Cave exterior was filmed in Bronson Canyon, in Griffith Park, Los Angeles. The interiors were shot at various soundstages, and the primary passage to the Batcave from the manor was located in Bruce Wayne's study, behind a bookshelf that retracted into the wall. The bookshelf was activated by a switch hidden in a bust of William Shakespeare. The bookshelf would disappear to reveal two labeled firepoles descending to the Batcave. Through an undisclosed mechanism, the poles allowed for Batman and Robin to go from their civilian garb to costume (the film based on the TV show shows a switch which initiates the change, though the process itself was never explained). The interiors and exterior of the Wayne Manor was also used in the original Mission: Impossible TV series episodes \\"Charity\\" and \\"The Visitors.\\" It was used in 2016 for another superhero group as the residence of Hydra leader, Gideon Malick, in Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC. Gotham Webb Institute's Stevenson Taylor Hall reprises its earlier film role as Wayne Manor for the TV series Gotham. A secret passageway behind the fireplace led to the Batcave. During the No Man's Land event in the fifth season, Bruce Wayne and Alfred are unable to return to Wayne Manor after the bridges connecting Gotham City to the rest of the mainland were destroyed by Jeremiah Valeska. Wayne Manor is eventually invaded by Jeremiah and completely destroyed by a number of explosives in the episode \\"Ace Chemicals\\". By the series finale \\"The Beginning...\\", which takes place ten years in the future, Wayne Manor is mentioned as being fully reconstructed. =Live-action films= Knebworth House was used for the exterior of the 1989 Batman film Stevenson Taylor Hall, Webb Institute in Glen Cove, New York was used as Wayne Manor in Batman Forever, Batman and Robin and TV Series Gotham. Mentmore Towers was used for exterior shots in Batman Begins. Wollaton Hall was used as Wayne Manor in The Dark Knight Rises. Lambert Hillyer serial The 1943 Batman serial originated the use of a grandfather clock as a door to the bat cave (or \\"bats’ cave\\" as it was called in the serial), a device which was then adopted by the comics. The austere bat cave featured only an ornate desk, on the wall behind which was projected the shape of a bat. Spencer Gordon Bennet serial 1949's Batman and Robin serial showed little more of Wayne Manor than its predecessor did. It continued the use of the grandfather clock as a secret door to the bat cave, which boasted more accoutrements than in the 1943 serial, including a holding cell. Tim Burton films In 1989's Batman, Knebworth House, a Gothic Tudor mansion north of London was used for the exterior. The interior, however, is Hatfield House, Hertfordshire. The gaming room from the movie used the long gallery, and the marble hall was used for Wayne's \\"arsenal\\" with the two-way mirror. In Batman Returns (1992), an original scale model was used for the exteriors of Wayne Manor. In the sequel, the passageway to the Batcave is uncovered by turning on the lights of an ornament in a nearby aquarium and dropping through a false floor in an iron maiden, although Alfred does quip that he'll \\"take the stairs\\". Joel Schumacher films In Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997), Webb Institute in Glen Cove, New York was used for the exterior shots of Wayne Manor. In Batman Forever, Dick Grayson discovers an entrance to the Batcave concealed behind a silverware storage cupboard. Christopher Nolan films In the more recent Batman Begins (2005), the former Rothschild estate, Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, was used to portray Wayne Manor's exterior and interior. In Batman Begins, the main part of the mansion is destroyed by fire caused by Ra's al Ghul, although its foundations survive intact and rebuilding efforts are underway as the film ends, with Alfred suggesting to Bruce to make improvements on the mansion's southeast corner (where the Batcave is located). The secret passage is an elevator shaft originally built as part of the Underground Railroad, accessed by playing three notes on a nearby piano. In The Dark Knight (2008), Wayne Manor is still being reconstructed and is thus never seen, though it is briefly mentioned as being near the outer city limits in a neighborhood called the Palisades. Bruce Wayne relocates to a two-story tall penthouse apartment within a hotel he purchased, and his equipment is located in a different area: a secret bunker underneath a cargo container in a construction zone owned by Wayne Enterprises. The penthouse has a secret entrance to a location within the hotel where Wayne hides his equipment as Batman. According to the viral campaign, it is , with ceilings, two gigantic balconies, heliport for his private helicopter, and 360 degree view of the entire city. The monthly maintenance fee is around $31,000. The reconstructed Wayne Manor has appeared in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) which takes place eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, and Wollaton Hall (which Mentmore Towers is a near replica of) in Nottingham as Wayne Manor's exterior and interior. The Selina Kyle drawing room scene in The Dark Knight Rises was filmed in Osterley Park House in Hounslow, England, which is in a suburb of London. In the movie, the mastermind criminal Bane destroys a secret underground facility, an event that leads to the discovery of The Batcave. The film's drawing room is the real life mansion's entrance hall. The interior was designed by famed Neoclassical architect Robert Adam. At the end of the movie, after Bruce retires his role as Batman after fulfilling his vows to turn Gotham City into a city of order, he had his associates convert the manor into an orphanage, and named it after his parents. DC Extended Universe Wayne Manor appears in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It has been abandoned for some time, after a large fire destroys most of the house, with Bruce and Alfred now residing within the \\"Glasshouse\\", a small modern mansion on the shores of a lake. Bruce visits his family's burial vault on the grounds of the mansion and briefly visits Wayne Manor's ruins before his battle with Superman. In Justice League, following the defeat of Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons, Bruce and Alfred re- visit the manor, accompanied by Diana, with Bruce discussing plans with them on rebuilding the Manor to serve as the new team's headquarters, and suggesting that the Manor's main hall could hold a round table of six chairs. Diana adds that the table should have room for more seats to be added in future, which Bruce agrees with. The interior of the manor was likely filmed on the Southill Estate in Bedfordshire Joker In the 2019 film Joker, Webb Institute in Glen Cove, New York was once again used for exterior shots of Wayne Manor, following the Joel Schumacher films and the 2014 television series Gotham. =Animation= DC Animated Universe In Batman: The Animated Series, an address is given for Wayne Manor in the episode \\"The Demon's Quest\\" stating that it is located at 1007 Mountain Drive, Gotham. The design of the manor was similar to previous versions, but included many more art deco aspects, inside and outside. This version of the manor was built on a cliff overlooking the ocean. The unique shape of the main section's roof vaguely resembled the \\"ears\\" of the Batman symbol. The Justice League also visited the manor during the Thanagarian invasion to plan their next attack after escaping captivity. It was damaged during a Thanagarian invasion of the manor itself looking for the Justice League. Following the Thanagarian's defeat Alfred began repairs. By the time of Batman: Beyond Wayne Manor is exactly the same from Batman: The Animated Series except with a few modern improvements. The inside of the Manor appears all but deserted and all possessions covered with blankets. The clock tower now opens with a pull of a lever in the clock. In Epilogue the grandfather clock is attached to the wall with no supporting bottom and opens similar to an airlock. The Batman In The Batman, Wayne Manor is depicted as a much taller building, with 7 floors. The initial entrance was hidden behind a video game machine, but following later seasons the entrance was replaced with the traditional grandfather clock and a batpole. Batman: The Brave and the Bold In Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Wayne Manor can be seen briefly in the episode, \\"The Color of Revenge\\", where Batman and Robin use the pole to access the Batcave. Batman: Under the Red Hood Wayne Manor is seen briefly when Bruce digs up Jason's grave site which is located in the backyard. Batman: Year One Wayne Manor is seen in the background during Bruce's training and a visit by Lieutenant Gordon and his wife. The design is exactly the same design on the graphic novel of the same name Batman: Year One Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 The design for Wayne Manor is the same one used in Batman: Year One. It served as the home and seclusion for Bruce Wayne after he retires from being Batman 10 years previously due to the death of Jason Todd through unknown circumstances. It lost all power and ran on an emergency generator when Gotham's power outage and the rest of the United States after Superman deflects a Soviet nuclear missile causing an EMP blast. Oliver Queen visited Bruce at the manor when planning to take down Superman. Wayne Manor was destroyed during Batman's final showdown with Superman in Gotham City after Alfred activated a self- destruct sequence. As the Manor burned to the ground Alfred looked on with sadness as he suffered a fatal stroke. Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox Wayne Manor is seen in the alternate timeline as the home of Thomas Wayne. However it is heavily dilapidated and all but abandoned with Thomas who has taken on the role of Batman, following the murder of his son Bruce by Joe Chill and the descent into madness and transformation into the Joker by his wife Martha. The balcony of the Manor is where Thomas and Barry Allen attempt on two occasions to restore Barry's connection to the Speed Force. The design used for the manor is the same one used for Batman: Year One and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns animated films. After Barry repairs the timeline, Wayne Manor is once again the residence of Bruce Wayne and restored to pristine condition. The Lego Batman Movie Wayne Manor is featured in The Lego Batman Movie being located on an island called \\"Wayne Island\\". The entrance to the Batcave is accessed behind a fireplace. Wayne Manor and Wayne Island are controlled by a HAL 9000-like version of the Batcomputer, here called \\"'Puter\\". =Video games= Injustice: Gods Among Us In Injustice: Gods Among Us, Wayne Manor is seen in a parallel universe where Superman rules the world. Because Batman's Insurgency opposed him, Superman exposed his identity and had the manor cordoned off. Batman, accompanied by Green Arrow, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Aquaman from another universe, infiltrate Wayne Manor to access the Batcave to retrieve a kryptonite weapon to use against Superman. Batman: Arkham Batman: Arkham City features several challenge maps set in Wayne Manor, including its main hall and armory. The interior of Wayne Manor is featured in the Batman: Arkham Origins DLC, Cold, Cold Heart. Bruce Wayne's New Year's Eve party is crashed by Mister Freeze and Penguin's gang, in search of Ferris Boyle. Wayne Manor is briefly featured in Batman: Arkham Knight. It is visible outside the game's bounds. After Scarecrow exposes Batman's identity to the world, a crowd of reporters gather outside the estate gates. The Dark Knight then returns to the manor to enact the Knightfall Protocol. Soon after he is greeted by Alfred and steps inside, Wayne Manor is destroyed by a series of explosions, giving the world the impression that Batman has died. =Music= The lyrics to the song \\"She Looks Like Fun\\" on the album Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino by Arctic Monkeys mention Wayne Manor.

Service history =North Atlantic and Squadron of Evolution, 1886–1895= Atlanta remained at New York fitting out and undergoing modifications until July 1887, when she joined the North Atlantic Squadron. For a little over two years, she cruised the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the West Indies. On 30 September 1889, she was reassigned to the Squadron of Evolution with which she voyaged to Europe and the Mediterranean that winter. On the return voyage the protected cruiser paid a friendship visit to the Republic of Brazil before returning to New York at the end of July 1890. There, she resumed duty along the east coast and in the West Indies. Between February and April 1891, she cruised the Gulf of Mexico. From May–October, the ship operated along the Atlantic coast and participated in exercises and maneuvers at Boston and New York, training members of the Naval Militia. Between October 1891 and July 1892, she served successively along the east coast, in the West Indies, and in South American waters. 6 inch (152 mm) gun on Atlanta. On 2 September 1892, the cruiser was transferred from the Squadron of Evolution back to the North Atlantic Squadron. Between December 1892 and February 1893, she operated in the West Indies protecting American interests. From March–May, the warship participated in the Naval Review held at Hampton Roads, Virginia. In May–June, she returned to the Gulf of Mexico. On 18 July 1893, Atlanta was placed out of commission at Norfolk, Virginia. There, she remained until recommissioned on 2 April 1894. She returned to duty on the North Atlantic station for the next 17 months. During that assignment, she put a landing party ashore at Boca del Toro, Colombia, on 8 March 1895 to protect American lives and property threatened by a Liberal Party revolt and the activity of filibusters. In September 1895, she was placed out of commission at the New York Navy Yard where she was laid up for the next five years. =South Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons, 1900–1905= The forecastle and 8 inch gun on Atlanta On 15 September 1900, she was placed back in commission at New York, Comdr. E. C. Pendleton in command. Late in October, the ship put to sea to join the South Atlantic Squadron off the coast of Brazil. She cruised those waters until November 1902 when she was transferred to the Caribbean Squadron. During the latter tour of duty, she again landed shore parties to protect American interests; first at Santo Domingo in April 1903 and then at Porto Bello, Panama, the following December. She made a voyage to the Mediterranean in 1904 and returned in October, via the western coast of Africa and Cape Town, to the South Atlantic station. She arrived back at Hampton Roads on 26 December and, in January 1905, moved to Annapolis, Maryland, where she was placed in reserve on 12 January. Atlanta remained inactive only until 8 May, at which time she was returned to full commission for service in the Coast Squadron to participate in midshipman training missions. =Barracks ship, 1905–1912= In November 1905, the warship moved to Norfolk where she served as a barracks ship for sailors of the Torpedo Flotilla until 1909. At that time, she moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where she resumed duty as a barracks ship. =Decommissioning and sale= On 23 March 1912, Atlanta was relieved of duty, and on 24 April her name was struck from the Navy List.

According to his autobiography, at the age of 16 or 17, Occom heard the teachings of Christian evangelical preachers in the Great Awakening. He began to study theology at the \\"Lattin School\\" of Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock in 1743 and stayed for four years until leaving to begin his own career. In addition to improving his English, Occom learned to read and speak Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. As a young man, the only book he owned was the Bible. From 1747 until 1749, Occum worked under and studied with the Reverend Solomon Williams in New London, Connecticut. Career Occom became a teacher, preacher, and judge among the Montaukett Native Americans in Montauk, eastern Long Island, and married Mary Fowler, a Montaukett woman. Occom helped some of the Pequot peoples he worked with assimilate and adopt European-style houses, dress and culture. He was officially ordained a minister on August 30, 1759, by the presbytery of Suffolk. Occom was never paid the same salary as white preachers, although promised he would be. The Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge also gave Occom a stipend for some time, but he lived in deep poverty for much of his life. In 1761 and 1763, Occom traveled to the Six Nations of the Iroquois in upstate New York to preach. Winning few converts, he returned to teach at Mohegan, Connecticut, near New London.Love, William DeLoss Samson, Samson Occom and the Christian Indians of New England, Chicago: Pilgrim Press: 1899, p. 100 Wheelock had meanwhile established an Indian charity school in Lebanon, Connecticut in 1754 with a legacy from Joshua Moor (among others). Upon Occom’s return to Mohegan, Wheelock persuaded his former pupil to travel to England to raise money for the school. Occom sailed from Boston December 23, 1765 and did not return until May 20, 1768. He preached his way across Britain from February 16, 1766, to July 22, 1767, delivering between 300-400 sermons, drawing large crowds wherever he went, and raising over £12,000 for Wheelock's project. King George III donated 200 pounds, and William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, subscribed 50 guineas. However, Occom on his return learned that Wheelock had failed to care for Occom's wife and children while he was away. Furthermore, Wheelock moved to New Hampshire and used the funds raised to establish Dartmouth College (named after the English earl) for the education of English colonists, rather than Native Americans as had originally been promised to Occom. Even 200 years later, the college had graduated less than 20 Indian students. John W. Barber In 1768, Occom wrote A Short Narrative of My Life, a ten-page manuscript now held in Dartmouth College's archive collection; however, it was not published until 1982. The document expands upon a single-page biography that Occom wrote before his preaching tour of England and Scotland. Occom also published Sermon at the Execution of Moses Paul and A Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs in 1774. All of these documents provide a very different perspective on the relations between colonists and Native Americans from Mary Rowlandson's narrative of her captivity in similar areas a century earlier. Ministry and later life Upon his return from England, Occom lived with his Mohegan people. After Wheelock's betrayal, Occom together with son- in-law Joseph Johnson, brothers-in-law David and Jacob Fowler, and others, worked to organize the Christian (or “praying”) Indians of New England and Long Island into a new tribe in Upstate New York. On October 4, 1774, the Oneida ceded land to the East Coast Indians and by 1775, the initial group had begun to migrate. Burnt out at the outset of the Revolution, many went to Massachusetts to live among the Stockbridge until their return in 1785. Occom, his son-in-law Joseph Johnson (who had been a messenger for General George Washington during the American Revolution), and his Montauk brother-in-law David Fowler led the people back to rebuild their settlement (near what is now Waterville, New York) called Brothertown. The Oneida also invited other Christian Indians to live with them, namely the Stockbridge Mohican from land claimed by western Massachusetts and two Lenape groups from the southern New Jersey area. The Mohicans founded what they called New Stockbridge in New York, near Oneida Lake.Origin & Early Mohican History, Stockbridge-Munsee Community Occom not only assured that these villages received official civil charters in 1787, but also evicted white settlers from Brothertown on April 12, 1792.Brooks, Joanna, The Collected Writings of Samson Occom, 2006: Oxford University Press Occom died on July 14, 1792, in New Stockbridge. He is said to be buried just off Bogusville Hill Road outside of Deansboro, New York. Legacy After Occom's death, during the 1820s, many Brothertown Indians and some Oneida accepted payment from New York State for their land and were removed to what is now known as the town of Brothertown in Calumet County, Wisconsin. In the modern era, the Brothertown Indians petitioned the federal government for recognition as a tribe, but were denied and have appealed. Several locations around Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, are named after Occom, including Occom Pond and Occom Ridge on the college campus's northern edge.Geographical coordinates of Occom Pond and Occom Ridge: The Native American Studies program has a Samson Occom professorship. The Occom Commons community space is part of Goldstein Hall in the recently opened McLaughlin Residential Cluster. Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Connecticut, also named a residence hall for upperclassmen after Occom. The Norwich, Connecticut neighborhood of Occum is named for Samson Occom. =Veneration= Occom is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on July 14. The Brothertown Indians celebrate Samson Occom Day as an official Tribal holiday every July 14. http://brothertownindians.org/image/cache/OccomDayRes.pdf Works of Samson Occom * A Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs, New London, Connecticut: Press of Thomas and Samual Green, 1774. *A Sermon Preached at the Execution of Moses Paul, An Indian Who Was Executed at New Haven on the 2nd of September 1772 for the Murder of Mr. Moses Cook, late of Waterbury, on the 7th of December 1771, New Haven: Press of Thomas and Samual Green, 1772. *\\"A Short Narrative of My Life\\".

For the importer, these terms refer to vehicles and parts designed to conform to Japanese regulations and to suit Japanese buyers. The term is abbreviated JDM. Compared to the United States where vehicle owners are now owning vehicles for a longer period of time, with the average age of the American vehicle fleet at 10.8 years, Japanese owners contend with a strict motor vehicle inspection and gray markets. According to the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, a car in Japan travels a yearly average of over only 9,300 kilometers (5,800 miles), less than half the U.S. average of 19,200 kilometers (12,000 miles). Japanese domestic market vehicles may differ greatly from the cars that Japanese manufacturers build for export and vehicles derived from the same platforms built in other countries. The Japanese car owner looks more toward innovation than long-term ownership which forces Japanese carmakers to refine new technologies and designs first in domestic vehicles. For instance, the 2003 Honda Inspire featured the first application of Honda's Variable Cylinder Management. However, the 2003 Honda Accord V6, which was the same basic vehicle, primarily intended for the North American market, did not feature VCM, which had a poor reputation after Cadillac's attempt in the 1980s with the V8-6-4 engine. VCM was successfully introduced to the Accord V6 in its redesign for 2008. In 1988, JDM cars were limited by voluntary self-restraints among manufacturers to 280 horsepower (PS) (276 hp) and a top speed of , limits imposed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) for safety. The horsepower limit was lifted in 2004 but the speed limit of remains in effect. Many JDM cars have speedometers that register up to 180 km/h (111.8 mph) (certain Nissans go up to 190 km/h, and the GT-R has a mechanism that removes the speed limiter on a track) but all have speed limiters Motorcycle Power & Speed Restrictions For many years Japan had severe restrictions on the maximum power and speed that motorcycles could have. All motorcycles for the Japanese domestic market were restricted to . Power restrictions were as follows =Pre-1993= *250cc class: 45 hp *400cc class: 59 hp *750cc class: 77 hp *over 750cc: not allowed =Post-1993= *250cc class: 40 hp *400cc class: 53 hp *750cc class: 77 hp *over 750cc: allowed, but restricted to 100 hp VIN Japanese carmakers do not use a Vehicle Identification Number as is common overseas. Instead, Japan uses a Frame Number--nine to twelve alphanumeric characters identifying model and serial number. For example, Frame Number SV30-0169266 breaks down as \\"V30\\" identifying the model as Toyota Camry/Vista x30; \\"S\\" identifying the engine (4S-FE), and \\"0169266\\" being the serial number of the vehicle. Vehicle make is not identified but slight number variations can identify the carmaker, i.e. Toyota usually uses seven digits for its serial numbers while Nissan uses six. Because a frame number contains far less information than a VIN, JDM vehicles also use a Model Code. As an example, SV30-BTPNK breaks down as \\"SV30\\", which means the same as above, and \\"BTPNK\\" which designates a set of features incorporated in the vehicle. Worldwide popularity =Motorcycles= In the 90's the JDM power restrictions along with licence restrictions that made it difficult to be licensed on larger motorcycles resulted in a number of models that were not offered anywhere else in the world, with 250cc and 400cc miniature replicas of the bigger 750cc & 900cc bikes. At the same time Japan had particularly tough laws regarding road licensing and sales regulations. Any motorcycle more powerful than 250cc had to take a extensively stringent test every two years. Combining these factors with a virtually non-existent second hand market made it economic to export the nearly new bikes abroad where they were eagerly bought and a number of import specialists sprung up to cater for this \\"grey import\\" market of relatively inexpensive but interesting motorcycles. In the later 90's as Japan's economy fell into recession it became less profitable to export and Japanese owners held on to their bikes for longer. The last global crash all but ended the \\"grey import\\" industry with the big specialist importers closing down. =Cars= The Japanese domestic market has been growing significantly since the late 1990s.Tsuneishi, Scott Top JDM Trends Of All Time superstreetonline.com. 2007. Retrieved Nov 3, 2014 Many car enthusiasts are attracted to the Japanese domestic market in different continents such as North America, Europe, and Asia. Popular brands include Honda, Subaru, Toyota, Mazda, Suzuki, Lexus, Mitsubishi Motors and Nissan. Ex-Japan Imports are also very common in New Zealand where 59% of vehicles registered on New Zealand roads originated from overseas markets as opposed to 41% of which were delivered NZ-New. Of this, 94% originate from Japan. New Zealand imported an average of 134,834 JDM vehicles per year in the period 2015-2019, the majority of which were Mazda Axela, Suzuki Swift, Nissan Tiida, Toyota Corolla and Mazda Demio. Other models popular for importation in previous years include performance vehicles (Honda Tourneo, Nissan Skyline, Nissan Laurel and Toyota Altezza), and kei cars (Suzuki Carry, Daihatsu Move, Subaru R2). Due to the popularity of used imports from Japan, and their relatively low crash-test ratings, the Ministry of Transport is currently investigating tougher restrictions on imported vehicles, most notably on the importation of the Toyota Corolla, Mazda Demio and Suzuki Swift. In 2004, importing JDM cars became popular in Canada as highly sought after vehicles, such as the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, became eligible to import under Canada's 15-year rule. In contrast, importing grey market vehicles into the United States is much more difficult. To avoid regulatory problems, most private individuals wait until EPA restrictions no longer apply to the desired vehicle, which is done on a rolling 25-year cycle. History of the term Super Street Magazine's Jonathan Wong helped popularise the term. Misconceptions A very common misunderstanding of the term is the false belief that JDM means Japanese produced vehicle. This is however untrue. A vehicle being manufactured in Japan does not make a vehicle JDM. JDM specifically means a vehicle that was produced with the intent of being sold in Japan, and not outside of the country. For example, the Toyota Supra MKIV was available brand new in the United States with left hand drive, and some changes to specification to comply to US law. This made it a Japanese manufactured vehicle designed to be sold new in the US market – a USDM vehicle. https://garagedreams.net/car-facts/what-does-jdm-mean-when-it-comes- to-cars An American market Japanese car such as Nissan 240SX is not a Japanese domestic market car as it was sold in the American domestic market. However the 240SX's Japanese market counterpart, the Nissan 180SX is a true JDM car as it was officially sold to the Japanese market via Nissan. Also some JDM cars are actually manufactured outside of Japan such as EM1 civics which were sold in the Japanese Domestic but manufactured in America. JDM inspired vehicles Some car enthusiasts like to build replicas of JDM vehicles from locally available cars. For example, enthusiasts in the USA will often take a US-market EK1 or EK4 Civic, convert it from left-hand-drive to right-hand- drive and source the required parts such as the engine and gearbox from the JDM EK9 Type R - which is based on the same platform - in order to make an 'exact' copy. However, cars such as this would not be authentic JDM cars as they would possess a United States VIN number. https://stickydiljoe.com/2012/06/05/wekfest-la-2012-coveragepart-2-the- morning/  See also  * Grey import vehicle * Import scene * Economy of Japan References External links * Category:Automotive industry in Japan Category:Retailing in Japan ","title":"Japanese domestic market"},{"id":"914182","text":"Viatcheslav Vladimirovich Ekimov (Russian Вячеслав Владимирович Екимов; born 4 February 1966 in Vyborg), nicknamed Eki, is a Russian former professional racing cyclist. A triple Olympic gold medalist, he was awarded the title of Russian Cyclist of the Century in 2001. Biography Ekimov started training as a cyclist at age 12 with a bicycle school affiliated with the famous centre of Aleksandr Kuznetsov. He trained in Leningrad at Lokomotiv and later Armed Forces sports society during the Soviet era. Ekimov won three Olympic gold medals: in the track team pursuit in Seoul (1988) for the USSR, and in an upset, in the road time trial in Sydney (2000) for Russia. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Ekimov won the silver medal for Russia in the men's road individual time trial, losing to American Tyler Hamilton. Hamilton was later stripped of his medal for doping and Ekimov was promoted to gold. Ekimov joined the USPS team in 1997 as its first key international signing, briefly retiring in 2001 before rejoining the team the following year. In the 2003 Tour de France Ekimov placed 10th in the prologue. He was a key force in the winning team time trial effort in stage four and was important to Lance Armstrong's fifth Tour victory both on the flats and in the mountains.

It is one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas and serves as the mouth of numerous streams, most notably the Lavaca and Colorado Rivers. The Texas seaport of Port Lavaca is located on the system's northwestern extension of Lavaca Bay. The city of Palacios is found on northeastern extension of Tres Palacios Bay, and Port O'Connor is located on the southwestern tip of the main bay's shore. The ghost town of Indianola, which was a major port before it was destroyed by two hurricanes in the late 19th century, is also found on the bay. The bay is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by Matagorda Peninsula. Its shore, especially near the Colorado River delta, provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The wildlife serves as a basis for the birding and fishing tourism, and is an essential component of the production of seafood, specifically shrimp and blue crab, which are the specialties of the area. The fertile land near the bay is ideal for farming, especially for the propagation of rice. History Early European records suggest that the bay and the surrounding area went by the names Espíritu Santo and Costa y Bahía de San Bernardo. Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda's map from the late 1510s appears to be the first documentation of the bay. In 1685, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle established the colony of Fort St. Louis along the bay's shore after missing the entrance to the Mississippi River. Half of the colonists were killed by disease, and the other half, save for five children, were killed by Karankawa Indians. It was afterward referred to as a \\"lost colony.\\" The Indians kept the children until they were rescued by the Spanish during the Alonso De León and Domingo Terán de los Ríos expeditions near the bay. In 1722 Spanish built a fort, Presidio La Bahia, and Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga on the site of Fort Saint Louis.Craig H. Roell and Robert S. Weddle, \\"NUESTRA SENORA DE LORETO DE LA BAHIA PRESIDIO,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/uqn11), accessed April 07, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Theodore Gudin's painting of La Salle's entrance into Matagorda Bay The port of Linnville was established on Matagorda Bay in 1831, and served as a main port for the Republic of Texas. The Great Comanche Raid of 1840 destroyed the town and forced the inhabitants to flee to the nearby Labbacca, which would later become known as Port Lavaca. Lavaca or la vaca, Spanish for cow, was founded in the wake of the Comanche Raid in 1841. It replaced Linnville as the main port on Matagorda Bay. However, the sandbar-heavy Lavaca Bay caused some navigational problems for ships. As a result, Lavaca was surpassed by Indianola as the main port on Matagorda Bay in the 1850s, even though the sandbars were dredged later in the decade. Indianola had been founded in 1846 as a landing place for German immigrants. It rapidly developed into a major seaport, and became the second largest in the state (after Galveston) by the 1860s. The two ports, and strategic control of Matagorda Bay in particular, became important during the American Civil War. Control of the bay shifted between the Union and Confederate forces several times. The Union presence in the area ended in June 1864. After the war, Indianola continued its growth, and had a population of 5,000 in the 1870s. A hurricane in 1875 caused massive damage to the city. It was rebuilt on a smaller scale shortly thereafter, but a second and more intense hurricane made landfall in 1886 (the fifth most intense in U.S. history), causing even greater destruction. The following year, Indianola was completely abandoned. Although Lavaca was also significantly affected by the hurricanes, it survived as a port, and again became the largest on the bay. It continues to hold this distinction today. It was renamed Port Lavaca in the late 19th century. Palacios was established around 1901, and Port O'Connor was founded on the bay in 1909. Before 1900, East Matagorda Bay was a free flowing extension, which formed the eastern segment of Matagorda Bay. Flooding and drainage issues caused by the Colorado River, which at the time emptied into the bay, precipitated a massive dredging campaign in the 1920s. Flooding was not remedied by the dredging, as sediment deposited in the bay and formed a tidal marsh that grew at a year. As a result, local citizens decided to change the course of the Colorado River in 1934 to bypass Matagorda Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, the dredging from this project causing the split and forming the isolated East Matagorda Bay. In 1992, the river was diverted back to the bay. Features Carancahua Bay (yellow), Chocolate Bay (brown), East Matagorda Bay (red), Keller Bay (lime), Lavaca Bay (orange), Matagorda Bay (purple), Tres Palacios Bay (magenta), Turtle Bay (olive) The shoreline of the bay is included in the Texas Coastal Plain. At the eastern end, near the Colorado River delta, there is a swampy terrain, with an abundance of wetlands and tidal marshes. Extended coastal prairies supporting native grasses, can be found throughout the area. On average, the Matagorda Bay system is deep, and covers approximately . The main extensions include: Lavaca Bay, which extends westward to the mouth of the Lavaca River; Tres Palacios Bay, which extends northeast to the mouth of the Tres Palacios River and East Matagorda Bay, which is nearly isolated from the system by the Colorado River delta. Other inlets include Turtle Bay, Carancahua Bay, Keller Bay, and Cox Bay. Together with its extensions, Matagorda Bay forms one of seven major estuaries along the Gulf Coast of Texas, and the third largest estuarine system in Texas behind Galveston Bay and Laguna Madre. It receives the discharge from the Colorado River and the Lavaca River, as well as numerous smaller creeks. Every second, approximately of water flows into the bay. Water exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Pass Cavallo, Matagorda Ship Channel, Greens Bayou, the Colorado River Delta Complex and Brown Cedar Cut. As a result of the seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 19 parts per thousand (ppt), which is lower than the seawater average of 35 ppt. Ecosystem A wide variety of wildlife can be found in and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have been caught in the bay: striped bass, gafftopsail catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, barred grunt, hake, skipjack herring, crevalle jack, ladyfish, Gulf menhaden, pigfish, smooth puffer, sand seatrout, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, gray snapper, southern stingray, Gulf toadfish and tripletail. The bay serves as a nursery for finfish, shrimp and crabs. Industry Shrimping boats in Palacios The Matagorda Bay system is a renowned fishing location in the region, due to its status as a nutrient-rich estuary. The mainstays of the settlements on the bay include seafood processing, manufacturing, agriculture and tourism. Commercial fishermen specialize in oyster, blue crab, and shrimp. Port Lavaca is the national leader in the processing of shrimp, and passed four million tons of seafood through its port in 1985 alone. Palacios houses the largest blue crab processing plant in the United States, and is home to the only individually quick frozen shrimp plant in Texas. Recreational fishing also contributes to the local economies via tourism. Tourists often flock to the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier, which is a major point of interest for fishermen. Other activities for visitors include hunting, oyster roasts, beach combing and birding. Several manufacturing complexes have been erected along the bay, which employ local residents. The Aluminum Company of America, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics all established plants in Point Comfort. The South Texas Nuclear Generating Station is found in nearby Bay City. Petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the bay in the 1930s. Maize, cotton, soybeans, turf, and rice grow well around the bay, especially in the fertile delta region.

He made his debut in Convorbiri literare (\\"Literary Conversations\\") (1871), with the comedy Fata de birău (\\"The Mayor's Daughter\\"). Alongside Eminescu he founded the Young Romania Social and Literary Academic Society and organized, in 1871, the Putna Celebration of the Romanian Students from Romania and from abroad. At the end of 1874, he settled in Bucharest, where he became secretary of the Hurmuzachi Collection Committee, then he became a professor, and then an editor of the newspaper Timpul (\\"The Time\\"). Alongside I. L. Caragiale and G. Coşbuc, he edited the Vatra (\\"The Hearth\\") review. During the first World War, he collaborated at the newspapers Ziua (\\"The Day\\") and Gazeta Bucureștilor (\\"The Bucharest Gazette\\"). He was awarded the Romanian Academy Award (1903).  Early life  Slavici was born in the village of Világos (now Șiria, Romania), near Arad, in 1848, the revolutionary year throughout Europe, with ramifications in Transylvania (then part of the Austrian Empire). Until 1868, Slavici studied at the local Orthodox school and various other institutions in Transylvania, being taught in either Hungarian or German. When he finished his studies, Slavici left Transylvania for Budapest, where he intended to study law. The following year, however, financial difficulties forced him to return home and take a job as a notary public. Throughout his employment, Ioan Slavici saved the money that would help him continue his studies.  Junimea  In 1871, he left for Vienna as part of his military service. This proved to be a decisive moment in the life of the future writer, as Slavici had a chance to meet Mihai Eminescu, the most important Romanian poet, who was studying at the city University. The two became good friends, with Eminescu encouraging and assisting Slavici in the development of his style and of the works themselves. The same year marked Slavici's literary debut in Convorbiri Literare, the mouthpiece of the Junimea society in Iaşi. In 1872, Slavici again had to interrupt his studies because of financial difficulties. Two years later, he left Austria-Hungary and moved to Iași, where he took part in the Junimea gatherings. In 1874 the Ioan Slavici Classical Theatre was established in his town of Arad. His first book, Nuvele din popor, a collection of short stories, was published in 1881. It included Moara cu noroc (The Lucky Mill) and Budulea Taichii, two of Slavici's best-known and crafted works.Reviews of \\"The Lucky Mill\\", in Book Review Digest, 1919 Books, pg. 462  Prisons and return to Romania  In 1882, he was selected as a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. In 1884, Slavici moved back to Transylvania, becoming actively involved in the Romanian national movement, serving as a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian National Party, the main political forum of Romanians in the region. Hungarian authorities sentenced Slavici to one year in prison for his nationalist stance. This was the first of many short stays in prison in Slavici's life (not all of them connected with his political attitudes - some were the outcome of lawsuits against other journalists). Six years later, he moved to Bucharest and, in 1894, he began publishing the first parts of his most famous novel, Mara, which was published as a single volume 12 years later. This is also the period of his activities as editor of Vatra magazine, alongside George Coşbuc and Ion Luca Caragiale.  World War I and later years  In 1909, Slavici began work for the pro-German newspaper Ziua. With the outbreak of World War I, his writings at the newspaper brought him into conflict with other intellectuals who supported the Triple Entente powers. On August 14, 1916, Romania entered the War on the Entente side, and had most of its territory (including Bucharest) occupied by the German, Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian troops in the summer of 1917. The Romanian legitimate government took refuge in Iași, with the Central Powers establishing a puppet administration for the occupied lands. Slavici collaborated with the new government, being employed as editor of the official journal, the Bucharest Gazette. After the German withdrawal in November 1918, he was put on trial for his wartime activities and spent one year in jail, while his reputation with the intelligentsia was forever tarnished. Slavici ended his life in Panciu (Vrancea county).  Antisemitism  In contrast to the Junimea leadership (but consistent with the attitudes expressed by some of the group's members), Slavici was a noted antisemite. His early definition of Jews as \\"a disease\\"Slavici, Soll și Haben—Chestiunea Ovreilor din România, in The Report of the International Committee for the Study of Holocaust in Romania was doubled by his arguments in favor of their violent expulsion from Romanian soil: :\\"The solution that remains for us is, at a signal, to close the borders, to annihilate them, to throw them into the Danube right up to the very last of them, so that nothing remain of their seed!\\" Later on, Slavici considered that: :\\"The hatred that has welled up against these people is natural, and this hatred can easily be unleashed against all of them that have inherited wealth or acquired it themselves, and could lead at the end to a horrible shedding of blood.\\"Slavici, Semitismul, in The Report of the International Committee for the Study of Holocaust in Romania  Works   References   External links  Works \\"Popa Tanda\\", in Roumanian Stories, trans.

He is a member of Magnum Photos and has won awards such as the Prix Nadar (1978), a Grand Prix National de la Photographie (1989), a Grand Prix Henri Cartier- Bresson (1991), and the Hasselblad Foundation International Award in Photography (1992). Exhibitions of his work have been held at the Museum of Modern Art and the International Center of Photography, New York; the Hayward Gallery, London; the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; and the Palais de Tokyo, Paris. Biography Koudelka was born in 1938 in the small Moravian town of Boskovice, Czechoslovakia. He began photographing his family and the surroundings with a 6×6 Bakelite camera. He studied at the Czech Technical University in Prague (ČVUT) in 1956, receiving a degree in engineering in 1961. He staged his first photographic exhibition the same year. Later he worked as an aeronautical engineer in Prague and Bratislava. Koudelka began taking commissions from theatre magazines, and regularly photographed stage productions at Prague's Theatre Behind the Gate on a Rolleiflex camera. In 1967, he decided to give up his career in engineering for full-time work as a photographer. Between 1962 and 1971, Koudelka travelled throughout Czechoslovakia and rural Romania, Hungary, France and Spain photographing Romani people (widely known in English by the exonym Gypsies). The Romani led a nomadic lifestyle and each summer Koudelka would travel for the project, \\"carrying a rucksack and a sleeping bag, sleeping in the open air, and living frugally\\". He had returned from photographing gypsies in Romania just two days before the Soviet invasion, in August 1968. He witnessed and recorded the military forces of the Warsaw Pact as they invaded Prague and crushed reforms of the so-called Prague Spring. Some of Koudelka's negatives were smuggled out of Prague to the Magnum Photos agency, and published anonymously in The Sunday Times Magazine under the initials P. P. (Prague Photographer) for fear of reprisal to him and his family. Koudelka's pictures of the events became dramatic international symbols, and came to be \\"recognised as one of the most powerful photojournalistic essays of the 20th century\\". In 1969 the \\"anonymous Czech photographer\\" was awarded the Overseas Press Club's Robert Capa Gold Medal for photographs requiring exceptional courage. Many of his photographs of these events were not seen until decades later. With Magnum to recommend him to the British authorities, Koudelka applied for a three-month working visa and fled to England in 1970, where he applied for political asylum and stayed for more than a decade. In 1971 he joined Magnum as an Associate Member and became a Full Member in 1974. He continued to wander around Europe with his camera and little else. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Koudelka sustained his work through numerous grants and awards, and continued to exhibit and publish major projects like Gypsies (1975) and Exiles (1988). Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Observer in 2011, described Gypsies as \\"a classic of documentary photography\\". Since 1986, he has worked with a panoramic camera and issued a compilation of these photographs in his book Chaos in 1999. Koudelka has had many other books of his work published, including in 2006 the retrospective volume Koudelka. He and his work received support and acknowledgment from his friend the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. He was also supported by the Czech art historian Anna Farova. In 1987, Koudelka became a French citizen, and was able to return to Czechoslovakia for the first time, in 1990. He then produced Black Triangle, documenting the wasted landscape in the Podkrušnohoří region, the western tip of the Black Triangle's foothills of the Ore Mountains, located between Germany and the Czech Republic. Koudelka lives in France and Prague and is continuing his work documenting the European landscape. He is the father of two daughters, one who lives in England and the other in France, Lucina Hartley Koudelka, and of a son living in Italy, Nicola Koudelka. Work Koudelka's early work significantly shaped his later photography, and its emphasis on social and cultural rituals as well as death. He soon moved on to a more personal, in depth photographic study of the Gypsies of Slovakia, and later Romania. This work was exhibited in Prague in 1967. Throughout his career, Koudelka has been praised for his ability to capture the presence of the human spirit amidst dark landscapes. Desolation, waste, departure, despair and alienation are common themes in his work. His characters sometimes seem to come out of fairytales. Still, some see hope within his work – the endurance of human endeavor, in spite of its fragility. His later work focuses on the landscape removed of human subjects. His most recent book Wall: Israeli and Palestinian Landscapes was published by Aperture Foundation in 2013. This book is composed of panoramic landscapes that he made between 2008 and 2012, as his project for the photography collective This Place, organized by photographer Frédéric Brenner. A documentary about Koudelka's work there, called Koudelka Shooting Holy Land, was released in 2015. Publications *Diskutujeme o moralce dneska.

A main figure in 19th century Romanian literature, he is best known for his Childhood Memories volume, his novellas and short stories, and his many anecdotes. Creangă's main contribution to fantasy and children's literature includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists (\\"Harap Alb\\", \\"Ivan Turbincă\\", \\"Dănilă Prepeleac\\", \\"Stan Pățitul\\"), as well as fairy tales indebted to conventional forms (\\"The Story of the Pig\\", \\"The Goat and Her Three Kids\\", \\"The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law\\", \\"The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter\\"). Widely seen as masterpieces of the Romanian language and local humor, his writings occupy the middle ground between a collection of folkloric sources and an original contribution to a literary realism of rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to erotic literature, collectively known as his \\"corrosives\\". A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an unconventional lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction. His literary debut came late in life, closely following the start of his close friendship with Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu and their common affiliation with the influential conservative literary society Junimea. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later critics have often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, as one of the most accomplished representatives of Junimist literature. Ion Creangă was posthumously granted several honors, and is commemorated by a number of institutions in both Romania and neighboring Moldova. These include the Bojdeuca building in Iași, which, in 1918, was opened as the first memorial house in Romania. His direct descendants include Horia Creangă, one of the leading Romanian architects during the interwar period. Biography =Background and family= Ion Creangă was born in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a former village which has since been incorporated into Târgu Neamț city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda.Călinescu, p. 477; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 206–207 His native area, bordering on heavily forested areas,Călinescu, p. 477 was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into what was then the principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations,Călinescu, p. 477, 488; Djuvara, p. 226–227, 244 and noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore.Călinescu, p. 477, 517, 974–975 Another characteristic of the area, which left an impression on Creangă's family history, was related to the practice of transhumance and the links between ethnic Romanian communities on both sides of the mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania: on his maternal side, the writer descended from Maramureș-born peasants,Călinescu, p. 477\\\\. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p. 206 while, according to literary historian George Călinescu, his father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper. The family had reached a significant position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of Pipirig, a family of community leaders. The latter's members included Moldavian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati, as well as Smaranda's father, Vornic David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at Neamț Monastery.Călinescu, p. 477, 478 Proud of this tradition, it was her who insisted for her son to pursue a career in the Church.Călinescu, p. 477, 478; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 206–207 According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged. Creangă's other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836.Călinescu, p. 478 The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă's younger brother Zahei). The imprecision also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer's parents were married to each other (and, if so, if they were on their first marriage), nor how many children they had together. At a time when family names were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and patronymics, the boy was known to the community as Nică, a hypocorism formed from Ion, or more formally as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei (\\"Nică of Ștefan of Petru\\", occasionally Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei).Călinescu, p. 477; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 206 =Childhood, youth and ordination= Casa din Humulești (\\"The House in Humulești\\"), painting by Aurel Băeșu After an idyllic period, which is recounted in the first section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an institution then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. Luminița Marcu, \\"O monografie spectaculoasă\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 21/2000 He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, Vasile Ilioaiei, was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca.Călinescu, p. 477, 479 Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia. After returning to school between late 1849 and early 1850, Creangă was pulled out by his financially struggling father, spent the following period working in wool-spinning, and became known by the occupational nickname Torcălău (\\"Spinster\\"). He only returned in third grade some four years later, having been sent to the Târgu Neamț public school, newly founded by Moldavian Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica as part of the Regulamentul Organic string of reforms. A colleague of future philosopher Vasile Conta in the class of priest and theologian Isaia \\"Popa Duhu\\" Teodorescu, Creangă was sent to the Fălticeni seminary in 1854.Călinescu, p. 477; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 207 After having been registered as Ioan Ștefănescu (a variant of his given name and a family name based on his patronymic), the adolescent student eventually adopted his maternal surname of Creangă. According to Călinescu, this was done either \\"for aesthetic reasons\\" (as his new name, literally meaning \\"branch\\" or \\"bough\\", \\"sounds good\\") or because of a likely discovery that Ștefan was not his real father. Dan Grădinaru, a researcher of Creangă's work, believes that the writer had a special preference for the variant Ioan, generally used in more learned circles, instead of the variant Ion that was consecrated by his biographers. Having witnessed, according to his own claim, the indifference and mundane preoccupations of his peers, Creangă admitted to having taken little care in his training, submitting to the drinking culture, playing practical jokes on his colleagues, and even shoplifting, while pursuing an affair with the daughter of a local priest. According to his own statement, he was a philanderer who, early in his youth, had already \\"caught the scent\\" of the catrință (the skirt in traditional costumes). Gabriela Ursachi, \\"Decembrie\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 50/2004 In August 1855, circumstances again forced him to change schools: confronted with the closure of his Fălticeni school, Creangă left for the Central Seminary attached to Socola Monastery, in Moldavia's capital of Iași.Călinescu, p. 478; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 207 Ștefan sin Petre's 1858 death left him without means of support, and he requested being directly ordained, but, not being of the necessary age, was instead handed a certificate to attest his school attendance. He was soon after married, after a brief courtship, to the 15-year-old Ileana, daughter of Priest Ioan Grigoriu from the church of the Forty Saints, where he is believed to have been in training as a schoolteacher. The ceremony took place in August 1859, several months after the personal union between Moldavia and its southern neighbor Wallachia, effected by the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Domnitor. Having been employed as a cantor by his father in law's church, he was ordained in December of the same year, assigned to the position of deacon in Holy Trinity Church, and, in May 1860, returned to Forty Saints. Relations between Creangă and Grigoriu were exceptionally tense. Only weeks after his wedding, the groom, who had probably agreed to marriage only because it could facilitate succeeding Grigoriu, Z. Ornea, \\"Nonconformisme celebre (1997)\\" , in Dilema Veche, Vol. V, Nr. 26, January 2008 signed a complaint addressed to Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, denouncing his father in law as \\"a killer\\", claiming to have been mistreated by him and cheated out of his wife's dowry, and demanding to be allowed a divorce. The response to this request was contrary to his wishes: he was ordered into isolation by the Dicasterie, the supreme ecclesiastical court, being allowed to go free only on promise to reconcile with Grigoriu. =Beginnings as schoolteacher and clash with the Orthodox Church= Ion Creangă as a deacon In 1860, Creangă enlisted at the Faculty of Theology, part of the newly founded University of Iași, and, in December 1860, fathered a son, Constantin. His life still lacked in stability, and he decided to move out of Grigoriu's supervision and into Bărboi Church, before his position as deacon was cut out of the budget and his belongings were evicted out of his temporary lodging in 1864. He contemplated leaving the city, and even officially requested a new assignment in the more remote Bolgrad. Since January 1864, when the Faculty of Theology had been closed down, he had been attending Iași's Trei Ierarhi Monastery normal school (Trisfetite or Trei Sfetite), where he first met the young cultural figure Titu Maiorescu, who served as his teacher and supervisor, and whence he graduated as the first in his class (June 1865).Călinescu, p. 479; Ornea (1998), p. 233–234, 235. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p. 32, 207 Embittered by his own experience with the education system, Creangă became an enthusiastic promoter of Maiorescu's ideas on education reform and modernization, and in particular of the new methods of teaching reading and writing.Ornea (1998), p. 233–236 During and after completing normal school, he was assigned to teaching positions at Trisfetite.Călinescu, p. 479; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 207 While there, he earned the reputation of a demanding teacher (notably by accompanying his reports on individual students with characterizations such as \\"idiot\\", \\"impertinent\\" or \\"envious\\").Călinescu, p. 479 Accounts from the period state that he made use of corporal punishment in disciplining his pupils, and even surpassed the standards of violence accepted at the time. In parallel, he was beginning his activities in support of education reform. By 1864, he and several others, among them schoolteacher V. Răceanu,Vianu, Vol. II, p. 208 were working on a new primer, which saw print in 1868 under the title Metodă nouă de scriere și cetire pentru uzul clasei I primară (\\"A New Method of Writing and Reading for the Use of 1st Grade Primary Course Students\\"). It mainly addressed the issues posed by the new Romanian alphabetical standard, a Romanization replacing Cyrillic spelling (which had been officially discarded in 1862). Adrian Pârvu, \\"Spațiul viral al geniului: o cameră și un ceardac\\" , in Jurnalul Național, December 20, 2005 Largely based on Maiorescu's principles, Metodă nouă ... became one the period's most circulated textbooks.Ornea (1998), p. 233–234 In addition to didactic texts, it also featured Creangă's isolated debut in lyric poetry, with a naïve piece titled Păsărica în timpul iernii (\\"The Little Bird in Wintertime\\"). The book was followed in 1871 by another such work, published as Învățătoriul copiilor (\\"The Children's Teacher\\") and co-authored by V. Răceanu.Ornea (1998), p. 234; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 208 It included several prose fables and a sketch story, \\"Human Stupidity\\", to which later editions added Poveste (\\"A Story\\") and Pâcală (a borrowing of the fictional folk character better known as Păcală).Braga, p. 205–206, 215 In February 1866, having briefly served at Iași's Pantelimon Church, he was welcomed by hegumen Isaia Vicol Dioclias into the service of Golia Monastery. Around 1867, his wife Ileana left him. After that moment, Creangă began losing interest in performing his duties in the clergy, and, while doing his best to hide that he was no longer living with his wife, took a mistress. The marriage's breakup was later attributed by Creangă himself to Ileana's adulterous affair with a Golia monk,Călinescu, p. 478–479 Constantin Coroiu, \\"Preoția lui Creangă\\", in Convorbiri Literare, December 2007 and rumors spread that Ileana's lover was a high-ranking official, the protopope of Iași. Creangă's accusations, Călinescu contends, are nevertheless dubious, because the deacon persisted in working for the same monastery after the alleged incident. Ion Creangă's home (present-day Creangă Museum) in Golia Monastery By the second half of the 1860s, the future writer was also pursuing an interest in politics, which eventually led him to rally with the more nationalist group within the Romanian liberal current, known as Free and Independent Faction.Ornea (1998), p. 231, 234; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 207 Cornelia Ștefănescu, \\"Mărturii despre Ion Creangă\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 15/2003 An agitator for his party, Creangă became commonly known under the nickname Popa Smântână (\\"Priest Sour Cream\\").Călinescu, p. 435; Ornea (1998), p. 231; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 207 In April 1866, shortly after Domnitor Cuza was toppled by a coup, and just before Carol I was selected to replace him, the Romanian Army intervened to quell a separatist riot in Iași, instigated by Moldavian Metropolitan Calinic Miclescu. It is likely that Creangă shared the outlook of other Factionalists, according to which secession was preferable to Carol's rule, and was probably among the rioters.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 207 At around the same time, he began circulating antisemitic tracts, and is said to have demanded that Christians boycott Jewish business.Oișteanu, p. 140 He is thought to have coined the expression Nici un ac de la jidani (\\"Not even a needle from the kikes\\"). He was eventually selected as one of the Factionalist candidates for an Iași seat in the Romanian Deputies' Chamber, as documented by the memoirs of his conservative rival, Iacob Negruzzi.Ornea (1998), p. 231 The episode is supposed to have taken place at the earliest during the 1871 suffrage. By 1868, Creangă's rebellious stance was irritating his hierarchical superiors, and, according to Călinescu, his consecutive actions show that he was \\"going out of his way for scandal\\". He was initially punished for attending a Iași Theater performance, as well as for defiantly claiming that there was \\"nothing scandalous or demoralizing\\" in what he had seen, and reportedly further antagonized the monks by firing a gun to scare off the rooks nesting on his church.Călinescu, p. 479; Vianu, Vol. I, p. 302; Vol. II, p. 208 The latter incident, which some commentators believe fabricated by Creangă's detractors, was judged absurd by the ecclesiastical authorities, who had been further alarmed by negative reporting in the press. When told that no clergyman other than him had been seen using a gun, Creangă issued a reply deemed \\"Nasreddinesque\\" by George Călinescu, maintaining that, unlike others, he was not afraid of doing so. Confronted by Metropolitan Calinic himself, Creangă allegedly argued that he could think of no other way to eliminate rooks, being eventually pardoned by the prelate when it was ruled that he had not infringed on canon law. =Defrocking and the Bojdeuca years= Creangă's Bojdeuca in Iași Creangă eventually moved out of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest.Călinescu, p. 479; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 208 The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked.Călinescu, p. 479\\\\. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p. 208–209 He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage. By then a teacher at the 1st School for Boys, on Română Street, Creangă was ordered out of his secular assignment in July 1872, when news of his status and attitude reached Education Minister Christian Tell. Upset by the circumstances, and objecting in writing on grounds that it did not refer to his teaching abilities, he fell back on income produced by a tobacconist's shop he had established shortly before being dismissed. This stage marked a final development in Creangă's conflict with the church hierarchy. Summoned to explain why he was living the life of a shopkeeper, he responded in writing by showing his unwillingness to apologize, and indicated that he would only agree to face secular courts.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 209 The virulent text notably accused the church officials of being his enemies on account of his \\"independence, sincerity, honesty\\" in supporting the cause of \\"human dignity\\".Vianu, Vol. I, p. 302; Vol. II, p. 209 After the gesture of defiance, the court recommended his defrocking, its decision being soon after confirmed by the synod. In the meantime, Creangă moved into what he called Bojdeuca (or Bujdeuca, both being Moldavian regional speech for \\"tiny hut\\"), a small house located on the outskirts of Iași. Officially divorced in 1873,Călinescu, p. 479; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 209 he was living there with his lover Ecaterina \\"Tinca\\" Vartic. \\"Muzeul Literaturii Române Iași\\", hosted by Dacia Literară; retrieved August 3, 2009 A former laundress who had earlier leased one of the Bojdeuca rooms, she shared Creangă's peasant-like existence. This lifestyle implied a number of eccentricities, such as the former deacon's practice of wearing loose shirts throughout summer and bathing in a natural pond.Călinescu, p. 479; Vianu, Vol. I, p. 302; Vol. II, p. 214 Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Ion Creangă între natură și cultură\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 44/2004 His voracious appetite, called \\"proverbial gluttony\\" by George Călinescu, was attested by contemporary accounts. These depict him consuming uninterrupted successions of whole meals on a daily basis. Șerban Anghelescu, \\"Poveștile cu poale-n brîu\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 462, February 2009 In May 1874, soon after taking over Minister of Education in the Conservative Party cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu, his friend Maiorescu granted Creangă the position of schoolteacher in the Iași area of Păcurari.Călinescu, p. 479; Ornea (1998), p. 234; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 209–210 During the same period, Ion Creangă met and became best friends with Mihai Eminescu, posthumously celebrated as Romania's national poet.Călinescu, p. 445, 480; Ornea (1998), p. 232–233, 239–241, 244–245; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 210–212 This is said to have taken place in summer 1875, when Eminescu was working as an inspector for Maiorescu's Education Ministry, overseeing schools in Iași County: reportedly, Eminescu was fascinated with Creangă's talents as a raconteur, while the latter admired Eminescu for his erudition.Ornea (1998), p. 233, 239–240, 245; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 210 =Junimea reception= Romanian Cyrillic book in Creangă's collection. Creangă's 1878 marginalia identify it as a gift from Mihai Eminescu, referred to as \\"the eminent writer and the greatest poet among Romanians\\" At around the same time, Creangă also began attending Junimea, an upper class literary club presided upon by Maiorescu, whose cultural and political prestige was increasing. This event, literary historian Z. Ornea argued, followed a time of indecision: as a former Factionalist, Creangă was a natural adversary of the mainstream Junimist \\"cosmopolitan orientation\\", represented by both Maiorescu and Negruzzi, but was still fundamentally committed to Maiorescu's agenda in the field of education.Ornea (1998), p. 234–236 Literary historians Carmen- Maria Mecu and Nicolae Mecu also argue that, after attending Junimea, the author was able to assimilate some of its innovative teachings into his own style of pedagogy, and thus helped diffuse its message outside the purely academic environment.Mecu & Mecu, p. 189 The exact date of his reception is a mystery. According to Maiorescu's own recollections, written some decades after the event, Creangă was in attendance at a Junimea meeting of 1871, during which Gheorghe Costaforu proposed to transform the club into a political party.Ornea (1998), p. 230–231 The information was considered dubious by Z. Ornea, who argued that the episode may have been entirely invented by the Junimist leader, and noted that it contradicted both Negruzzi's accounts and minutes kept by A. D. Xenopol.Ornea (1998), p. 230–232 According to Ornea's assessment, with the exception of literary critic Vladimir Streinu, all of Creangă's biographers have come to dismiss Maiorescu's statement. Several sources mention that the future writer was introduced to the society by Eminescu, who was an active member around 1875.Ornea (1998), p. 200, 232–233, 244–245; Vianu, Vol. I, p. 304; Vol. II, p. 210 This and other details lead Ornea to conclude that membership was granted to Creangă only after the summer break of 1875.Ornea (1998), p. 232–233 Gradually or instantly,Ornea (1998), p. 236 Creangă made a positive impression by confirming with the Junimist ideal of authenticity. He also became treasured for his talkative and jocular nature, self-effacing references to himself as a \\"peasant\\", and eventually his debut works, which became subjects of his own public readings.Călinescu, p. 479–480 His storytelling soon earned him dedicated spectators, who deemed Creangă's fictional universe a \\"sack of wonders\\" at a time when the author himself had started casually using the pseudonym Ioan Vântură-Țară (\\"Ioan Gadabout\\"). Silvia Craus, \\"Balurile Junimii\\", in Ieșeanul, February 28, 2006 Although still in his forties, the newcomer was also becoming colloquially known to his colleagues as Moș Creangă (\\"Old Man Creangă\\" or \\"Father Creangă\\"), which was a sign of respect and sympathy.Constantinescu, p. 61 Among Ion Creangă's most dedicated promoters were Eminescu, his former political rival Iacob Negruzzi, Alexandru Lambrior and Vasile Pogor,Ornea (1998), p. 236–237; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 18, 210–211 as well as the so-called caracudă (roughly, \\"small game\\") section, which comprised Junimists who rarely took the floor during public debates, and who were avid listeners of his literary productions (it was to this latter gathering that Creangă later dedicated his erotic texts). In parallel to his diversified literary contribution, the former priest himself became a noted voice in Junimist politics, and, like his new friend Eminescu, voiced support for the group's nationalist faction, in disagreement with the more cosmopolitan and aristocratic segment led by Maiorescu and Petre P. Carp.Mecu & Mecu, p. 187 By that the late 1870s, he was secretly redirecting political support from the former Factionalists to his new colleagues, as confirmed by an encrypted letter he addressed to Negruzzi in March 1877. =Literary consecration= Autumn 1875 is also often described as his actual debut in fiction prose, with \\"The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law\\", a short story first publish in October by the club's magazine Convorbiri Literare.Ornea (1998), p. 232; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 210 In all, Convorbiri Literare would publish 15 works of fiction and the four existing parts of his Childhood Memories before Creangă's death.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 211 Reportedly, the decision to begin writing down his stories had been the direct result of Eminescu's persuasion.Vianu, Vol. I, p. 305; Vol. II, p. 210 His talent for storytelling and its transformation into writing fascinated his new colleagues. Several among them, including poet Grigore Alexandrescu, tasked experimental psychologist Eduard Gruber with closely studying Creangă's methods, investigations which produced a report evidencing Creangă's laborious and physical approach to the creative process. The latter also involved his frequent exchanges of ideas with Vartic, in whom he found his primary audience.Vianu, Vol. I, p. 305; Vol. II, p. 209, 220–221 In addition to his fiction writing, the emerging author followed Maiorescu's suggestion and, in 1876, published a work of educational methodology and the phonemic orthography favored by Junimea: Povățuitoriu la cetire prin scriere după sistema fonetică (\\"Guide to Reading by Writing in the Phonetic System\\"). It was supposed to become a standard textbook for the training of teachers, but was withdrawn from circulation soon afterward, when the Catargiu cabinet fell.Ornea (1998), p. 234 After losing his job as school inspector following the decisions of a hostile National Liberal executive,Călinescu, p. 445 Mihai Eminescu spent much of his time in Bojdeuca, where he was looked after by the couple. For five months after quarreling with Samson Bodnărescu, his fellow poet and previous landlord, Eminescu even moved inside the house, where he reputedly pursued his discreet love affair with woman writer Veronica Micle, and completed as many as 22 of his poems. Creangă introduced his younger friend to a circle of companions which included Zahei Creangă, who was by then a cantor, as well as Răceanu, priest Gheorghe Ienăchescu, and clerk Nicșoi (all of whom, Călinescu notes, had come to share the raconteur's lifestyle choices and his nationalist opinions).Călinescu, p. 480 Eminescu was especially attracted by their variant of simple life, the rudimentary setting of Creangă's house and the group's bohemian escapades.Călinescu, p. 480; Vianu, Vol. I, p. 303; Vol. II, p. 210 Circumstances drew the two friends apart: by 1877, Eminescu had relocated in Bucharest, the capital city, regularly receiving letters in which Creangă was asking him to return. He was however against Eminescu's plan to marry Veronica Micle, and made his objection known to the poet.Nastasă, p. 110 In 1879, as a sign that he was formalizing his own affair with Tinca Vartic, Creangă purchased the Bojdeuca in her name, paying his former landlord 40 Austrian gulden in exchange. That same year, he, Răceanu and Ienăchescu published the textbook Geografia județului Iași (\\"The Geography of Iași County\\"), followed soon after by a map of the same region, researched by Creangă and Răceanu. A final work in the area of education followed in 1880, as a schoolteacher's version of Maiorescu's study of Romanian grammar, Regulile limbei române (\\"Rules of the Romanian Language\\"). =Illness and death= Creangă (top) with A. C. Cuza and N. A. Bogdan, during balneotherapy in Slănic-Moldova, 1885 Creangă's grave in Eternitatea Cemetery, Iași By the 1880s, Creangă had become afflicted with epilepsy, suffering accelerated and debilitating episodes.Călinescu, p. 480; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 211, 212. See also Ornea (1995), p. 443 He was also severely overweight, weighing some 120 kilograms (over 250 pounds), with a height of 1.85 meters (6 feet), and being teasingly nicknamed Burduhănosul (\\"Tubby\\") by his friends (although, according to testimonies by his son and daughter-in-law, he did not actually look his size). Despite his activity being much reduced, he still kept himself informed about the polemics agitating Romania's cultural and political scene. He was also occasionally hosting Eminescu, witnessing his friend's struggle with mental disorder. The two failed to reconnect, and their relationship ended.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 211–212 After one of the meetings, he recorded that the delusional poet was carrying around a revolver with which to fend off unknown attackers—among the first in a series of episodes which ended with Eminescu's psychiatric confinement and death during June 1889.Călinescu, p. 445–446 Around that time, Creangă, like other Junimists, was involved in a clash of ideas with the emerging Romanian socialist and atheistic group, rallied around Contemporanul magazine. This occurred after Contemporanul founder Ioan Nădejde publicly ridiculed Învățătoriul copiilor over its take on creationism, quoting its claim that \\"the invisible hand of God\\" was what made seeds grow into plants.Călinescu, p. 545 Creangă replied with a measure of irony, stating that \\"had God not pierced the skin over our eyes, we would be unable to see each other's mistakes\\". Nevertheless, Călinescu argued, Nădejde's comments had shaken his adversary's religious sentiment, leading Creangă to question the immortality of the soul in a letter he addressed to one of his relatives in the clergy.Călinescu, p. 546 According to other assessments, he was himself an atheist, albeit intimately so. In 1887, the National Liberal Ministry of Dimitrie Sturdza removed Creangă from his schoolteacher's post, and he subsequently left for Bucharest in order to petition for his pension rights.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 212 Having hoped to be granted assistance by Maiorescu, he was disappointed when the Junimea leader would not respond to his request, and, during his final years, switched allegiance to the literary circle founded by Nicolae Beldiceanu (where he was introduced by Gruber). Among Creangă's last works was a fourth and final part of his Memories, most likely written during 1888.Ornea (1998), p. 236; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 212 The book remained unfinished, as did the story Făt-frumos, fiul iepei (\\"Făt-Frumos, Son of the Mare\\"). He died after an epileptic crisis, on the last day of 1889,Călinescu, p. 480; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 211, 212 his body being buried in Iași's Eternitatea Cemetery. \\"Ansamblul funerar al scriitorului Ion Creangă\\", \\"Bustul scriitorului Ion Creangă\\", \\"Mormântul scriitorului Ion Creangă\\", entries in Patrimoniul istoric și arhitectural, Iași, România database; retrieved August 3, 2009 His funeral ceremony was attended by several of Iași's intellectuals (Vasile Burlă, A.

Cuza, Dumitru Evolceanu, Nicolae Iorga and Artur Stavri among them).Nastasă, p. 65 Work =Cultural context= The impact of Ion Creangă's work within its cultural context was originally secured by Junimea. Seeking to revitalize Romanian literature by recovering authenticity, and reacting against those cultural imports it deemed excessive, the group notably encouraged individual creativity among peasants.Călinescu, p. 397 Reflecting back on Maiorescu's role in the process, George Călinescu wrote: \\"A literary salon where the personal merit would take the forefront did not exist [before Junimea] and, had Creangă been born two decades earlier, he would not have been able to present 'his peasant material' to anyone. Summoning the creativity of the peasant class and placing it in direct contact with the aristocrats is the work of Junimea.\\" His cogenerationist and fellow literary historian Tudor Vianu issued a similar verdict, commenting: \\"Junimea is itself ... an aristocratic society. Nevertheless, it is through Junimea that surfaced the first gesture of transmitting a literary direction to some writers of rural extraction: a phenomenon of great importance, the neglect of which would render unexplainable the entire subsequent development of our literature.\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p. 213 Also referring to cultural positioning within and outside the group, Carmen-Maria Mecu and Nicolae Mecu took the acceptance of \\"literate peasants\\" such as Creangă as exemplary proof of Junimist \\"diversity\\" and \\"tolerance\\".Mecu & Mecu, p. 186–187 Maiorescu is known to have had much appreciation for Creangă and other writers of peasant origin, such as Ion Popovici-Bănățeanu and Ioan Slavici.Călinescu, p. 413; Ornea (1998), p. 57–58, 65, 67, 70–71, 157 Late in life, he used this connection to challenge accusations of Junimist elitism in the face of criticism from more populist traditionalists.Călinescu, p. 413; Ornea (1998), p. 57–58, 70–71 Nonetheless, Junimea members in general found Creangă more of an entertainer rather than a serious writer, and treasured him only to the measure where he illustrated their theories about the validity of rural literature as a source of inspiration for cultured authors.Ornea (1998), p. 236–239, 252, 258–259; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 211, 214 Therefore, Iacob Negruzzi sympathetically but controversially referred to his friend as \\"a primitive and uncouth talent\\".Ornea (1998), p. 237; Vianu, Vol. I, p. 305, 306; Vol. II, p. 211, 214 Maiorescu's critical texts also provide little individual coverage of Creangă's contributions, probably because these failed to comply exactly with his stratification of literary works into poporane (\\"popular\\", that is anonymous or collective) and otherwise.Ornea (1998), p. 124, 238–239, 252 Tudor Vianu's theory defines Creangă as a prime representative of the \\"popular realism\\" guidelines (as sporadically recommended by the Junimist doyen himself), cautioning however that Creangă's example was never mentioned in such a context by Maiorescu personally.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 217; Vol. III, p. 208–209, 211–212 Although he occasionally downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself was aware that his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts to be recognized as an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's \\"somewhat surreptitious\\" method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art.Braga, p. 213; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 215–216 Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: \\"You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did.\\" An exception among Junimea promoters was Eminescu, himself noted for expressing a dissenting social perspective which only partly mirrored Maiorescu's take on conservatism. According to historian Lucian Boia, the \\"authentic Moldavian peasant\\" that was Creangă also complemented Eminescu's own \\"more metaphysical\\" peasanthood.Lucian Boia, Romania: Borderland of Europe, Reaktion Books, London, 2001, p. 247\\\\. Similarly, Z. Ornea notes that the poet used Creangă's positions to illustrate his own ethnonationalist take on Romanian culture, and in particular his claim that rural authenticity lay hidden by a \\"superimposed stratum\\" of urbanized ethnic minorities.Ornea (1998), p. 239–241 20th century critics have described Creangă as one of his generation's most accomplished figures, and a leading exponent of Junimist literature. This verdict is found in several of Vianu's texts, which uphold Creangă as a great exponent of his generation's literature, comparable to fellow Junimea members Eminescu, Slavici and Ion Luca Caragiale.Vianu, Vol. I, p. 305; Vol. II, p. 136–137, 221–222 This view complements George Călinescu's definition, placing the Moldavian author in the company of Slavici and Caragiale as one of the \\"great prose writers\\" of the 1880s.Călinescu, p. 477–514 Lucian Boia, who noted that \\"the triad of Romanian classics\\" includes Creangă alongside Eminescu and Caragiale, also cautioned that, compared to the other two (with whom \\"the Romanians have said almost all there is to say about themselves\\"), Creangă has \\"a rather more limited register\\". The frequent comparison between Creangă and Caragiale in particular is seen by Vianu as stemming from both their common \\"wide-ranging stylistic means\\" and their complementary positions in relations to two superimposed phenomenons, with Caragiale's depiction of the petite bourgeoisie as the rough equivalent of Creangă's interest in the peasantry.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 217 The same parallelism is explained by Ornea as a consequence of the two authors' social outlook: \\"[Their works] have cemented aesthetically the portrayal of two worlds. Creangă's is the peasant world, Caragiale's the suburban and urban one. Two worlds which represent, in fact, two characteristic steps and two sociopolitical models in the evolution of Romanian structures which ... were confronting themselves in a process that would later prove decisive.\\"Ornea (1998), p. 229 According to the same commentator, the two plus Eminescu are their generation's great writers, with Slavici as one \\"in their immediate succession.\\"Ornea (1998), p. 244 While listing what he believes are elements bridging the works of Creangă and Caragiale, other critics have described as strange the fact that the two never appear to have mentioned each other, and stressed that, although not unlikely, a direct encounter between them was never recorded in sources. =Narrative style and language= Highlighting Ion Creangă's recourse to the particularities of Moldavian regionalisms and archaisms, their accumulation making Creangă's work very difficult to translate,Anca Mureșan, \\"The Stylistics of the Parts of the Speech in Memories of Childhood\\", in the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu's American, British and Canadian Studies, Vol. V, December 2004 George Călinescu reacted against claims that the narratives reflected antiquating patterns. He concluded that, in effect, Creangă's written language was the equivalent of a \\"glossological museum\\", and even contrasted by the writer's more modern everyday parlance. Also discussing the impression that Creangă's work should be read with a Moldavian accent, noted for its \\"softness of sound\\" in relation to standard Romanian phonology, Călinescu cautioned against interpretative exaggerations, maintaining that the actual texts only offer faint suggestions of regional pronunciation.Călinescu, p. 480–481 Contrasting Creangă with the traditions of literature produced by Wallachians in what became the standard literary language, Călinescu also argued in favor of a difference in mentality: the \\"balance\\" evidenced by Moldavian speech and illustrated in Ion Creangă's writings is contrasted by the \\"discoloration and roughness\\" of \\"Wallachianism\\".Călinescu, p. 10 He also criticized those views according to which Creangă's variant of the literary language was \\"beautiful\\", since it failed to \\"please everyone on account of some acoustical beauty\\", and since readers from outside the writer's native area could confront it \\"with some irritation.\\"Călinescu, p. 481 For Călinescu, the result nevertheless displays \\"an enormous capacity of authentic speech\\", also found in the works of Caragiale and, in the 20th century, Mihail Sadoveanu.Călinescu, p. 631 According to the same commentator, the dialectical interventions formed a background to a lively vocabulary, a \\"hermetic\\" type of \\"argot\\", which contained \\"hilarious double entendres and indecent onomatopoeia\\", passing from \\"erudite beauty\\" to \\"obscene laughter\\".Călinescu, p. 488 Some of the expressions characteristic of Creangă's style are obscure in meaning, and some other, such as \\"drought made the snake scream inside the frog's mouth\\", appear to be spontaneous and nonsensical. Another specific trait of this language, commented upon by Vianu's and compared by him to the aesthetics of Classicism, sees much of Creangă's prose being set to a discreet poetic meter.Vianu, Vol. I, p. 306; Vol. II, p. 221 The recourse to oral literature schemes made it into his writings, where it became a defining trait. As part of this process, Călinescu assessed, \\"Creangă acts as all his characters in turn, for his stories are almost entirely spoken. ... When Creangă recounts, the composition is not extraordinary, but once his heroes begin talking, their gesticulation and wording reach a height in typical storytelling.\\"Călinescu, p. 482 According to the critic, discovering this \\"fundamental\\" notion about Creangă's work was the merit of literary historian and Viața Românească editor Garabet Ibrăileanu, who had mentioned it as a main proof of affiliation to realism.Călinescu, p. 667 The distinctive manner of characterization through \\"realistic dialogues\\" is seen by Vianu as a highly personal intervention and indicator of the Moldavian writer's originality.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 216–221, 229 Both Vianu and Călinescu discussed this trait, together with the technique of imparting subjective narration in- between characters' replies, as creating other meeting points between Creangă and his counterpart Caragiale.Călinescu, p. 482; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 217, 219 Partly replicating in paper the essence of social gatherings, Ion Creangă often tried to transpose the particular effects of oral storytelling into writing. Among these characteristic touches were interrogations addressed to the readers as imaginary listeners, and pausing for effect with the visual aid of ellipsis.Michel Moner, Cervantès conteur. Écrits et paroles, Casa de Velázquez, Madrid, 1989, p. 81–82. He also often interrupted his narratives with concise illustrations of his point, often in verse form, and usually introduced by vorba ceea (an expression literally meaning \\"that word\\", but covering the sense of \\"as word goes around\\").Călinescu, p. 480, 488 One example of this connects the notions of abundance and personal satisfaction: In other cases, the short riddles relate to larger themes, such as divine justification for one's apparent fortune: =Creangă's specificity= Despite assuming the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated him from his roots: \\"peasants do not have [his] entirely cultured gifts. ... Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much polychromy at the expense of linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal.\\"Călinescu, p. 486 The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose.Călinescu, p. 487–488 According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was \\"a supreme artist\\"Vianu, Vol. I, p. 306 whose use of \\"typical sayings\\" attests \\"a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample.\\" These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing during the second half of the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a \\"strictly intellectual sensuousness\\" and the notion that \\"pleasure arises from gratuitousness\\", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to \\"the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one.\\"Braga, p. 200 In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed \\"the impossible\\", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: \\"from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy\\".Braga, p. 214 Călinescu viewed such intellectual traits as shared by Creangă with his Wallachian counterpart Anton Pann, in turn linking both writers to the satirical component of Renaissance literature, and specifically to François Rabelais.Călinescu, p. 487–488, 975 Within local tradition, the literary historian saw a symbolic connection between Creangă and the early 18th century figure, Ion Neculce, one of Moldavia's leading chroniclers.Călinescu, p. 10, 24 While he made his own comparison between Creangă and Pann, Tudor Vianu concluded that the Moldavian writer was in fact superior, as well as being more relevant to literature than Petre Ispirescu, the prime collector of tales in 19th-century Wallachia.Vianu, Vol. I, p. 304, 306 Also making use of the Rabelais analogy, literary chronicler Gabriela Ursachi found another analogy in local letters: Ion Budai-Deleanu, an early 19th-century representative of the Transylvanian School, whose style mixes erudite playfulness with popular tastes. These contextual traits, researchers assess, did not prevent Creangă's overall work from acquiring a universal aspect, particularly since various of his writings use narrative sequences common throughout world literature.Beza, p. 104–105; Călinescu, p. 484; Ornea (1995), p. 84; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 215 George Călinescu also assessed that these literary connections served to highlight the elevated nature of Creangă's style, his \\"erudite device\\", concluding: \\"Writers such as Creangă can only show up in places where the word is ancient and equivocal, and where experience has been condensed into unchanging formulas. It would have been more natural for such a prose writer to have emerged a few centuries later, into an era of Romanian humanism. Born much earlier, Creangă showed up where there exists an ancient tradition, and therefore a species of erudition, ... in a mountain village ... where the people is unmixed and keeping [with tradition].\\" Outlining his own theory about the aspects of \\"national specificity\\" in Romanian letters, he expanded on these thoughts, listing Creangă and Eminescu as \\"core Romanians\\" who illustrated a \\"primordial note\\", complemented by the \\"southern\\" and \\"Balkan\\" group of Caragiale and others.Călinescu, p. 974–975 Claiming that the \\"core\\" presence had \\"not primitive, but ancient\\" origins, perpetuated by \\"stereotyped wisdom\\" and \\"energetic fatalism\\", he asserted: \\"Creangă shows our civilization's contemporaneity with the world's oldest civilizations, our Asian age.\\"Călinescu, p. 975 The alternating national and regional characteristics in Creangă's writings are related by historian Neagu Djuvara with the writer's place of birth, an affluent village in an isolated region, contrasting heavily with the 19th century Wallachian countryside: \\"if the mud hut villages of the Danube flood plain are to be taken into account, one finds himself in a different country.\\"Djuvara, p. 227 Ornea, who noted that Eminescu effectively shared Creangă's worldview, believed the latter to have been dominated by nostalgia for a world of independent landowning peasants, and argued that Creangă's literary and political outlook were both essentially conservative.Ornea (1998), p. 240–244 Ornea commented: \\"One could say that it was through [this form of nostalgia] that the writer debuted and that, within the space of his work it became, in its own right, an expression of the world that was about to vanish.\\"Ornea (1998), p. 241 Commenting on Creangă's \\"robust realism\\" and lack of \\"sentimentality\\", Vianu contrarily asserted: \\"Creangă's nostalgia ... has an individual, not social, sense.\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p. 214 The witty and playful side of Creangă's personality, which became notorious during his time at Junimea and constituted a significant part of his appeal, was reflected into a series of anecdotes. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow Junimists in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself \\"for against\\" during a two- option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle and the two of them on either side, while comparing it to the crucifixion scene and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of Romanian humor. The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who would ask him for money: \\"not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and the day before yesterday and last week and last week and throughout life\\". His joyfulness complemented his overall Epicureanism and his gourmand habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink.Simona Brânzaru, \\"Thoughts about a Possible History of Gaster's Presence in Romanian Literature\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 23/2004 Overall, Eduard Gruber's report contended, Creangă's writing relied on him being \\"a strong sensual and auditive type\\", and a \\"very emotional\\" person. Ion Creangă's sense of humor was instrumental in forging the unprecedented characteristics of his work. American critic Ruth S. Lamb, the writer's style merges \\"the rich vocabulary of the Moldavian peasant\\" with \\"an original gaiety and gusto comparable to that of Rabelais.\\"Lamb, p. 243 According to George Călinescu: \\"[Creangă] got the idea that he was a clever man, like all men of the people, and therefore used irony to make himself seem stupid.\\" In Călinescu's view, the author's antics had earned him a status equivalent to that of his Wallachian Junimist counterpart Caragiale, with the exception that the latter found his inspiration in urban settings, matching \\"Nasreddinisms\\" with \\"Miticism\\".Călinescu, p. 430, 479, 493, 449 Z. Ornea sees the main protagonists in Creangă's comedic narratives as, in effect, \\"particularized incarnations of the same symbolic character\\", while the use of humor itself reflects the traditional mindset, \\"a survival through intelligence, that of a people with an old history, whose life experience has for centuries been concentrated into gestures and words.\\"Ornea (1998), p. 243 =Most prominent tales= Part of Ion Creangă's contribution to the short story, fantasy and children's literature genres involved collecting and transforming narratives circulating throughout his native region, which intertwine with his characteristic storytelling to the point where they become original contributions.Călinescu, p. 56, 487–488 According to Călinescu, the traditional praise for Ion Creangă as a creator of literary types is erroneous, since his characters primarily answered to ancient and linear narrative designs. The conclusion is partly shared by Braga, who links Creangă's tales to ethnological and anthropological takes on the themes and purposes of fairy tales, postulating the prevalence of three ancient and related narrative pretexts throughout his contributions: the preexistence of a \\"perturbing situation\\" (attributable to fatality), the plunging of the hero into a rite of passage-type challenge, a happy ending which brings the triumph of good over evil (often as a brutal and uncompromising act).Braga, p. 207–213 Like their sources and predecessors in folklore, these accounts also carry transparent morals, ranging from the regulation of family life to meditations about destiny and lessons about tolerating the marginals. However, Swedish researcher Tom Sandqvist argues, they also illustrate the absurdist vein of some traditional narratives, by featuring \\"grotesqueries\\" and \\"illogical surprises\\".Tom Sandqvist, Dada East. The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts & London, 2006, p. 227, 247. With \\"The Goat and Her Three Kids\\", written mainly as a picturesque illustration of motherly love, Creangă produced a fable in prose, opposing the eponymous characters, caricatures of a garrulous but hard-working woman and her restless sons, to the sharp-toothed Big Bad Wolf, a satirical depiction of the cunning and immoral stranger. The plot shows the wolf making his way into the goat's house, where he eats the two older and less obedient kids, while the youngest one manages to escape by hiding up the chimney—the symbolism of which was psychoanalyzed by Dan Grădinaru, who claims it constitutes an allusion to Creangă's own childhood. The dénouement sees an inversion of the natural roles, an episode which, ethnologist Șerban Anghelescu notes, is dominated by \\"the culinary fire\\": the goat exercises her brutal revenge by trapping and slowly cooking the predator. This approach partly resonates with that of \\"The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law\\", in which Creangă makes ample use of a traditional theme in Romanian humor, which portrays mothers-in-law as mean, stingy and oppressive characters.Călinescu, p. 482; Constantinescu, p. 63–65 The embodiment of such offensive traits, she is also shown to be ingenious, pretending that she has a hidden third eye which always keeps things under watch.Constantinescu, p. 64 The narrator sides with the three young women in depicting their violent retribution, showing them capturing their oppressor, torturing her until she is left speech impaired, and leaving her on the brink of death.Călinescu, p. 482; Constantinescu, p. 64–65 The mother-in-law's end turns into a farce: the eldest and most intelligent of the killers manipulates her victim's dying sounds into a testament partitioning her wealth, and a thin decorum is maintained at the funeral ceremony by the daughters' hypocritical sobbing.Constantinescu, p. 65 \\"The Story of the Pig\\" partly illustrates the notion that parental love subdues even physical repulsion, showing an elderly peasant couple cherishing their adopted porcine son, who, unbeknown to them, is enchanted.Călinescu, p. 481, 483; Constantinescu, p. 65–66 The creature instantly offsets his parents' sadness and immobility by his witty intelligence. Having applied his perseverance and spells to erect a magical bridge, the piglet fulfills the requirement for marrying the emperor's daughter, after which it is uncovered that he is a Făt-Frumos or Prince Charming character who assumes his real identity only by night.Călinescu, p. 483–484 Although the plot is supposed to deal with imperial magnificence in fairy tale fashion, the setting is still primarily rural, and the court itself is made to look like an elevated peasant community. According to researcher Marcu Beza, the text is, outside of its humorous context, a distant reworking of ancient legends such as Cupid and Psyche.Beza, p. 104–105 The story introduces three additional characters, old women who assess and reward the efforts of the virtuous: Holy Wednesday, Holy Friday and Holy Sunday.Braga, p. 210; Constantinescu, p. 66–67 They represent a mix of Christian and pagan traditions, by being both personifications of the liturgical calendar and fairy-like patrons of the wilderness (zâne).Constantinescu, p. 66–67 A similar perspective was favored by \\"The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter\\". Here, the theme echoes Cinderella, but, according to Călinescu, the rural setting provides a sharp contrast to the classical motif.Călinescu, p. 484 Persecuted by her stepmother and stepsister, the kind and loving daughter of the old man is forced into a position of servitude reflecting the plight of many peasant women in Creangă's lifetime. In this case, the old man is negatively depicted as cowardly and entirely dominated by his mean wife.Constantinescu, p. 68 The focal point of the narrative is the meeting between the good daughter and Holy Sunday. The latter notices and generously rewards the girl's helpful nature and mastery of cooking; in contrast, when her envious sister attempts the same and fails, she ends up being eaten by serpent-like creatures (balauri).Constantinescu, p. 67–68 The happy ending sees the good girl marrying not Prince Charming, but a simple man described as \\"kind and industrious\\"—this outcome, Călinescu assessed, did not in effect spare the old man's daughter from a life of intense labor. A story very similar to \\"The Old Man's Daughter ...\\" is \\"The Purse a' Tuppence\\", which teaches that greed can shatter families, while offering symbolic retribution to men who are unhappy in marriage. The old man's rooster, chased away by the old woman for being unproductive, ends up amassing a huge fortune, which he keeps inside his belly and regurgitates back into the courtyard; the jealous old woman ends up killing her favorite hen, who has failed in replicating the rooster's feat.Braga, p. 207, 210, 212 =Devil-themed stories and \\"Harap Alb\\"= Depiction of Hell in an 18th-century Romanian Orthodox mural (Sfântul Elefterie Vechi, Bucharest) Several of Creangă's characteristic novellas are infused with themes from Christian mythology, fictionalizing God, Saint Peter and the army of devils, most often with the comedic intent of showing such personages behaving like regular people.Călinescu, p. 482–483, 484 A defining story in this series is \\"Dănilă Prepeleac\\", whose eponymous peasant hero is characterized by what Șerban Anghelescu calls \\"idiocy serving to initiate\\", or, according to Gabriela Ursachi, \\"complete, and therefore sublime, stupidity.\\" The first part of the story shows Dănilă exchanging his oxen for an empty bag—a set of dialogues which, George Călinescu argued, is almost exactly like a comedy play.Călinescu, p. 482–483 In what was described as a complete reversal in characterization, the hero uses intelligence and ruse to trick and frighten several devils.Braga, p. 209, 210, 212–213 Contrarily, \\"Stan Pățitul\\" shows its hero fraternizing with a lesser demon. Following the opening episode, in which the latter accidentally eats a bit of mămăligă dedicated by Stan to those who honor God, Satan himself condemns his subordinate to service the peasant. Călinescu highlights the naturalness of exchanges between the two protagonists, the latter of whom assumes the endearing form of a frail boy, Chirică, who ends up moving in with Stan and entering his service.Călinescu, p. 483 The writing was also noted for other realistic elements alluding to everyday life, such as the overtly colloquial exchange between Chirică and Satan, or the episodes in which the young devil helps Stan woo a peasant woman. Although relatively young, Stan himself is referred to as stătut (\\"frowzy\\" or \\"lacking in freshness\\"), and the wording reflects rural attitudes about men who fail to marry during a certain age interval.Constantinescu, p. 69 Toward the end, the story focuses on a corrupt old woman who tries to trick Stan's new wife into committing adultery, but fails and is banished to the remotest area of Hell. Viewed by Călinescu as Creangă's \\"most original manner of dealing with the fabulous\\", and paralleled by him with Caragiale's Kir Ianulea on account of its realist approach to the supernatural, \\"Stan Pățitul\\" is, according to Vianu, untraceable in its inspiration: \\"[its] folk origin could not be identified, but it is not dismissible\\".Vianu, Vol. II, p. 215 Another account in this series is \\"Ivan Turbincă\\", whose protagonist, a Russian serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and ultimately accomplishing the human ideal of cheating Death.Constantinescu, p. 70–71Tudor Pamfile, \\"Enemies and Friends of Man II\\" (excerpts), in Plural Magazine, Nr. 24/2004 Ana-Maria Plămădeală, \\"Spațiul fascinant în care muzica se întîlnește cu filmul\\", in Revista Sud-Est, April 2002 The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and Ukrainian folklore, while, according to researcher of children's literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to German tradition's Till Eulenspiegel.Constantinescu, p. 70 In the beginning of the account, God rewards the soldier's exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (turbincă), which can miraculously trap anything in existence. In order to circumvent the laws of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, pretending not to understand the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside. Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised an eternity of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to feel sad. \\"Harap Alb\\", one of Ion Creangă's most complex narratives, carries a moral defined by Călinescu as \\"the gifted man will earn a reputation under any guise.\\" The story opens with a coming of age quest, handed down by a king to his three sons: the most fit among them is supposed to reach the court of the Green Emperor, who is the king's brother, and succeed him to the throne. According to Călinescu, the mission bases itself on travels undertaken by young men in Creangă's native region, while the subsequent episodes in the narrative reinforce the impression of familiarity, from the \\"peasant speech\\" adopted by the villain known as the Bald Man, to the \\"crass vulgarity\\" evidenced by the antagonist Red Emperor.Călinescu, p. 484–485 Forced to pass himself off as a foreign servant (or \\"Moor\\"), the prince is three times tested and aided by Holy Sunday, who doubles as the queen of zâne creatures. Călinescu described as \\"playful realism\\" the method through which Creangă outlined the mannerisms of several other characters, in particular the allegorical creatures who provide the youngest prince with additional and serendipitous assistance.Călinescu, p. 485 In one noted instance, the characters Setilă (\\"Drink-All\\") and Flămânzilă (\\"Eat-All\\") help the hero overcome seemingly impossible tasks set by the Red Emperor, by ingesting unnaturally huge amounts of food and drink. The tale builds on intricate symbolism stemming from obscure sources. It features what Muguraș Constantinescu calls \\"the most complex representation of Holy Sunday\\", with mention of her isolated and heavenly abode on \\"flower island\\". A background antithesis opposes the two fictional monarchs, with the Red Emperor replicating an ancient tradition which attributes malignant characteristics to the color.Adrian Majuru, \\"Khazar Jews. Romanian History and Ethnography\\" (excerpts), in Plural Magazine, Nr. 27/2006 By contrast, the Green Emperor probably illustrates the ideals of vitality and healthy lifestyle, as hinted by his culinary preference for \\"lettuce from the garden of the bear\\".Constantinescu, p. 68–69, 71 Historian Adrian Majuru, building on earlier observations made by linguist Lazăr Șăineanu, also connects the servant-prince's antagonists with various reflections of ethnic strife in Romanian folklore: the Red Emperor as standing for the medieval Khazars (\\"Red Jews\\"), the Bald Man as a popular view of the Tatars. =Childhood Memories= The second part of Childhood Memories in manuscript form, introductory paragraphs Childhood Memories is, together with a short story about his teacher Isaia Teodorescu (titled \\"Popa Duhu\\"),Braga, p. 208; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 207 one of Creangă's two memoirs. George Călinescu proposed that, like his fairy tales, the book illustrates popular narrative conventions, a matter accounting for their special place in literature: \\"The stories are true, but typical, without depth. Once retold with a different kind of gesticulation, the subject would lose all of its lively atmosphere.\\" Also based on the techniques of traditional oral accounts, it features the topical interventions of a first-person narrator in the form of soliloquies, and reflects in part the literary canon set by frame stories. The resulting effect, Călinescu argued, was not that of \\"a confession or a diary\\", but that of a symbolic account depicting \\"the childhood of the universal child.\\" According to Vianu, the text is especially illustrative of its author's \\"spontaneous passage\\" between the levels of \\"popular\\" and \\"cultured\\" literature: \\"The idea of fictionalizing oneself, of outlining one's formative steps, the steady accumulation of impressions from life, and then the sentiment of time, of its irreversible flow, of regret for all things lost in its consumption, of the charm relived through one's recollections are all thoughts, feelings and attitudes defining a modern man of culture. No popular model could have ever stood before Creangă when he was writing his Memories, but, surely, neither could the cultured prototypes of the genre, the first autobiographies and memoirs of the Renaissance\\".Vianu, Vol. II, p. 220 Grădinaru and essayist Mircea Moț analyzed the volume as a fundamentally sad text, in stated contrast with its common perception as a recollection of joyful moments: the former focused on moments which seem to depict Nică as a loner, the latter highlighted those sections which include Creangă's bitter musings about destiny and the impregnability of changes. A distinct interpretation was provided by critic Luminița Marcu, who reacted against the tradition of viewing Creangă's actual childhood as inseparable from his own subjective rendition. Several of the book's episodes have drawn attention for the insight they offer into the culture, structure and conflicts of traditional society before 1900. Commenting on this characteristic, Djuvara asserted: \\"even if we take into account that the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, how could we not recognize the sincerity in Creangă's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?\\"Djuvara, p. 226 The book stays true to life in depicting ancient customs: discussing the impact of paganism on traditional Romanian customs, Marcu Beza communicated a detail of Creangă's account, which shows how January 1 celebrations of Saint Basil opposed the loud buhai players reenacting a fertility rite to people preferring a quieter celebration.Beza, p. 9 The work also offers details on the traditional roles of a rural society such as that of Humulești, in the context of social change. Muguraș Constantinescu highlights the important roles of old men and women within Nică's universe, and especially that of his grandfather and \\"clan leader\\" David Creangă.Constantinescu, p. 62–63 The latter, she notes, is an \\"enlightened man\\" displaying \\"the wisdom and balance of the ripe age\\", a person able to insist on the importance of education, and a churchgoer who frowns on \\"his wife's bigotry.\\"Constantinescu, p. 62 The seniors' regulatory role within the village is evidenced throughout the book, notoriously so in the episode where the boy captures a hoopoe who bothers his morning sleep, only to be tricked into releasing it by old man, who understands the bird's vital role as village alarm clock. Another significant part of the account, detailing Creangă's education, shows him frustrated by the old methods of teaching, insisting on the absurd image of children learning by heart and chanting elements of Romanian grammar and even whole texts.Ornea (1998), p. 235–236 The narrator refers to this method as \\"a terrible way to stultify the mind\\".Ornea (1998), p. 235 The negative portrayal of teaching priests was commented by writer and critic Horia Gârbea as proof of the author's anticlericalism, in line with various satirical works targeting the Romanian clergy: \\"Creangă's Memories of the catechism school would discourage any candidate.\\"Gârbea, p. 127–128 =Didactic writings= Creangă's contribution to literature also covers a series of didactic fables written as lively dialogues, among them \\"The Needle and the Sledge Hammer\\", in which the objects of traditional metalworking scold the byproducts of their work for having forgotten their lowly origin.Braga, p. 206–207; Călinescu, p. 485 The inspiration behind this theme was identified by Călinescu as \\"The Story of a Gold Coin\\", written earlier by Creangă's Junimist colleague Vasile Alecsandri.Călinescu, p. 317, 485 A similar piece, \\"The Flax and the Shirt\\", reveals the circuit of fibers from weed-like plants into recycled cloth, leading to the conclusion that \\"all things are not what they seem; they were something else once, they are something else now;—and shall become something else.\\" The technique employed by Creangă has the flax plant teaching the less knowledgeable textile, a dialogue which Călinescu likened to that between old women in a traditional society. Included alongside the two stories were: Pâcală, a writing which, Mircea Braga argued, is not as much didactic as it is a study in dialogue; \\"The Bear Tricked by the Fox\\", which uses legendary and humorous elements in an attempt to explain why bears are the tail-less species among mammals; and Cinci pâini (\\"Five Loafs of Bread\\"), which serves as a condemnation of greed.Braga, p. 206, 208, 212 With \\"Human Stupidity\\", Creangă builds a fable about incompetence in its absolute forms. The story centers on a peasant's quest to find people who are less rational than his wife, having been infuriated by her panic at the remote possibility that a ball of salt could fall from its place of storage and kill their baby. This, essayist and chronicler Simona Vasilache argues, highlights \\"a family-based division\\" of illogical behavior, in which women are depicted as the main propagators of both \\"astonishing nonsense\\" and \\"prudent stupidity\\". Simona Vasilache, \\"Drobul de sare\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 44/2007 Instead, literary critic Ion Pecie identified inside the narrative a meditation on \\"the link between spirit and nature\\", with the unpredictable ball of salt representing the equivalent of a \\"sphinx\\". Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Un soi de revizuiri\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 23/2003 His colleague Gheorghe Grigurcu argued that such conclusions \\"may seem excessive\\", but that they were ultimately validated by the literary work being \\"a plurality of levels\\". A similar piece is the prose fable \\"The Story of a Lazy Man\\": fed up with the protagonist's proverbial indolence, which has led him as far as to view chewing food as an effort, his fellow villagers organize a lynching.Braga, p. 212 This upsets the sensibility of a noblewoman who happens to witness the incident. When she offers to take the lazy man into her care and feed him bread crumbs, he seals his own fate by asking: \\"But are your bread crumbs soft?\\" The peculiar effect of this moral is underlined by Anghelescu: \\"The lazy man dies as a martyr of his own immobility.\\" Braga interpreted the story as evidence of \\"the primacy of ethics\\" over social aspects in the local tradition. Ion Pecie saw in the story proof of Creangă's own support for capital punishment with a preventive or didactic purpose, even in cases were the fault was trivial or imagined, concluding: \\"Here, ... Creangă loses much of his depth.\\" Pecie's conclusion was treated with reserve by Grigurcu, who believed that, instead, the narrator refrains from passing any judgment on \\"the community's instinctual eugenic reaction\\". Partly didactic in scope, several of Creangă's anecdotes involve Ion Roată, a representative to the ad hoc Divan which voted in favor of Moldo-Wallachian union, and the newly elected Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza. The texts convey a sense of tension between the traditional boyar aristocracy and the peasant category, closely reflecting, according to historian Philip Longworth, a conflict mounting during the second half of the 19th century.Philip Longworth, The Making of Eastern Europe, Macmillan Publishers, Houndmills & London, 1997, p. 136, 155. The same is argued by Ornea, who also proposes that the protagonist offers insight into Creangă's own conservative reflexes and his complex views on the union, while outlining several connections which the brand of social criticism professed by Junimea.Ornea (1998), p. 242–243 Although Roată, a real-life person, was a representative of the pro-union National Party, his main interest, according to the stories themselves, was in curbing the boyars' infringement of peasant rights.Constantinescu, p. 61; Ornea (1998), p. 242–243 The stories' narrator directs his hostility not at boyars in general, but at the younger Romantic nationalist ones, whom he portrays as gambling on Moldavia's future: \\"[There was] a clash of ideas opposing old boyars to the youth of Moldavia's ad hoc Divan, even though both were in favor of 'Union'. It's only that the old ones wanted a negotiated 'Union', and the young ones a 'Union' done without proper thinking, as it came to pass.\\"Ornea (1998), p. 242 According to Muguraș Constantinescu: \\"[Roată] opposes the intelligence of common folk, their common sense, their humor and the pleasure of allegorical discourse to the pompous and hollow speeches of some politicians\\". In this context, Cuza's presence is depicted as both legitimate and serendipitous, as he takes a personal interest in curbing boyar abuse.Braga, p. 208, 211 =Moș Nichifor Coțcariul and \\"corrosives\\"= Seen by Romanian critic Radu Voinescu as an extended anecdote,Voinescu, p. 1127 the novella Moș Nichifor Coțcariul (\\"Old Man Nichifor Slyboots\\") establishes a connection with the language of fairy tales, being located in a legendary and non-historical age.Braga, p. 208–209 It details the elaborate seduction of a young Jewish bride by a worldly Moldavian wagoner, on the route between Târgu Neamț and Piatra. The episode, which the text itself indicates is just one in a series of Nichifor's conquests among his female clients, highlights the seducer's verbose monologue, which covers accounts of his unhappy marriage, allusions about the naturalness of physical love, and intimidating suggestions that wolves may be tempted to attack the wagon (prompting the young woman to seek refuge in his arms).Călinescu, p. 486–487, 488 The seducer's behavior, Constantinescu notes, presents an alternative to the theme of old age as a time of immobility: \\"the still-green old man, the rake, the joker who enjoys his amorous escapades, while justifying them by the natural course of life\\". Nichifor mostly expresses himself with the help of folk sayings, which he casually mixes in with personal observations about the situation.Călinescu, p. 486–487; Constantinescu, p. 62 The background to the plot is a record of various superstitions, some anticlerical or antisemitic: Nichifor voices the belief that priests crossing one's path will produce bad luck, as well as the claim that Jewish apothecaries sold \\"poisons\\".Oișteanu, p. 189, 223, 349 The reception of Moș Nichifor Coțcariul by Junimea illustrated its ambivalence toward Creangă. Maiorescu found the text \\"interesting in its way and decisively Romanian\\", but asked Convorbiri Literare journal to either modify it or refrain from publishing it altogether.Ornea (1998), p. 237, 252 This was complemented by its author's own self-effacing assessment: calling the text \\"a childish thing\\", he suggested to Maiorescu that revisions were needed, stating \\"I have written it long, because there was no time for me to write it short.\\" Contrarily, the writer's posterity referred to it as one of the greatest Romanian contributions to the genre: according to George Călinescu, the insight into Nichifor's musings resulted in transforming the writing as a whole into \\"the first great Romanian novella with a stereotypical hero\\", while Voinescu described the entire story as \\"a true masterpiece.\\" The narrative approaches of Moș Nichifor Coțcariul bordered on Creangă's contributions to erotic literature, pieces collectively known as \\"corrosives\\"Călinescu, p. 479, 488; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 213 and which have for long treated with discretion by literary historians. In Călinescu's view, this chapter in Creangă's literature created another link between the Moldavian writer and the Renaissance tradition of Rabelais: \\"All Rabelaisians have penetrated deeply into the realm of vulgarity.\\" The taste for titillating accounts was also cultivated by Junimea members, who discreetly signaled their wish to hear more explicit content by asking Creangă to recount stories from \\"the wide street\\". Constantin Cubleșan, \\"Erosul ca formă a revoltei\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, December 2008 A product of this context, Moș Nichifor Coțcariul itself is said to have had at least one sexually explicit variant, circulated orally. Two stories with explicit pornographic content survive as samples of Creangă's erotic authorship: \\"The Tale of Ionică the Fool\\" and \\"The Tale of All Tales\\" (also known as Povestea pulei, \\"Tale of the Dick\\" or \\"Tale of the Cock\\"). The former shows its cunning hero having intercourse with a priest's daughter, moving between prose and verse to describe the act. \\"The Tale of All Tales\\", which makes ample use of vulgar speech, recounts how a peasant disrespectful of divinity has his entire maize harvest transformed into male genitalia, but is able to turn out a profit by catering to the sexual appetites of women. Mircea Iorgulescu, \\"Mărunțișuri\\", in Cultura, Nr. 8/2006 The final section, seen by Gârbea as a sample of anticlerical jeers recorded by \\"the defrocked Creangă\\", depicts the rape of a priest by one such sexual object.Gârbea, p. 130 Although explicit, literary historian Alex. Ștefănescu argued, the text \\"is refined and full of charm\\". Alex. Ștefănescu, \\"Dacă talent nu e ...\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 40/2008 While acknowledging both \\"corrosives\\" for their \\"popular charm\\" in the line of Rabelais and Geoffrey Chaucer, and noting that they still display the author's place as a \\"great stylist\\", Voinescu also signaled the texts' \\"very obvious\\" debt to folkloric sources.Voinescu, p. 1128 In his definition, Ion Creangă is \\"possibly the only writer\\" to draw on the legacy of \\"luscious popular jests\\" found in local \\"erotic folklore\\". Nevertheless, according to literary critic Mircea Iorgulescu, \\"The Tale of All Tales\\" may in fact be based on Parapilla, a pornographic leaflet circulating in Italian and French. Legacy =Estate, family and early cultural impact= Soon after the Creangă's death, efforts began to collect his manuscript writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside A. D. Xenopol, Grigore Alexandrescu and Eduard Gruber, the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic. The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project came to an abrupt halt due to Gruber's insanity and death. Creangă's final known work, the fragment of Făt-frumos, fiul iepei, was published by Convorbiri Literare in 1898. The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and only a part of them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași market, where they were being used for wrapping paper.Vianu, Vol. II, p. 212–213 The collection, structured into a whole by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, was published by Editura Minerva in 1902 and 1906.Braga, p. 215; Vianu, Vol. II, p. 212–213 In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent Junimists, Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by Iacob Negruzzi, who transformed him, as Popa Smântână, into a character of his satirical poems Electorale (\\"Electorals\\"). The same author referred to his counterpart in one of his epigrams. Shortly after her lover's death, Tinca Vartic married a man who lived in the same part of Iași. The target of organized tourism from as early as 1890, the Iași Bojdeuca nevertheless fell into disrepair. It was eventually purchased by an \\"Ion Creangă Committee\\", whose members included Constantin Creangă, Kirileanu and the ultra-nationalist politician A. C. Cuza. \\"Bojdeuca scriitorului Ion Creangă\\", entry in Patrimoniul istoric și arhitectural, Iași, România database; retrieved August 3, 2009 It was set up as the first of Romania's \\"memorial houses\\" on April 15, 1918. Restored the same year and again in 1933–1934, it houses an important part of Creangă's personal items and the first known among Creangă's portraits, painted by his contemporary V. Mușnețanu. While Constantin Creangă had a successful career in the Romanian Army, one of the writer's two grandsons, Horia Creangă, became one of the celebrated modern architects of the interwar period, earning his reputation by redesigning much of downtown Bucharest. \\"Nepotul lui Creangă a clădit Bucureștiul\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, September 26, 2006 The popularity of Ion Creangă's accounts outside his regional and dialectal context, together with his own contribution as an educator, played a part in the evolution of standard Romanian, at a new phase in which many dialectal variations were incorporated into the spoken language.Jürgen Erfurt, \\"Dimensiunile sociolingvistice ale limbii române vorbite\\", in Klaus Bochmann (ed.), Limba română vorbită în Moldova istorică, Vol. I, Leipziger Universitätsverlag, Leipzig, 2002, p. 31\\\\. His primers Metodă nouă ... and Învățătoriul copiilor went through many editions during the late 19th century. The impact of his works was also a contributing factor to preserving a noted interest in rural subjects, a subsequent defining trait in modern Romanian literature. Discussing \\"stylistic harmony\\", which he believed to be bridging all of Romania's social and literary environments, philosopher Mircea Eliade wrote: \\"Romanians consider Ion Creangă a classic writer belonging to the modern age. His work can be read and understood by the entire range of social classes, in all the provinces of our country. In spite of the abundant presence of Moldavian words in his writings, the work would not remain a stranger to its readers. What other European culture can take pride in having a classic writer read by all categories of readers?\\"Mircea Eliade, \\"The Museum of the Romanian Village\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 24/2004 The \\"thematic grip of the village\\" was noted by American academic Harold Segel, who investigated its impact on \\"some of the most revered names in the history of Romanian literature\\", from Creangă and Slavici to interwar novelist Liviu Rebreanu.Harold Segel, The Columbia Literary History of Eastern Europe Since 1945, Columbia University Press, New York & Chichester, 2008, p. 55\\\\. =Early 20th century and interwar echoes= Ion Creangă, as depicted on a 1937 Romanian stamp A more thorough evaluation of Creangă's literature began after 1900. At the time, it became a topic of interest to the emerging traditionalist and populist trend, illustrated by the two venues rivaling Junimea: the right-wing Sămănătorul, led by Nicolae Iorga, and the left-wing Poporanists, among which was Garabet Ibrăileanu.Braga, p. 199–200; Ornea (1998), p. 238; Vianu, Vol. III, p. 38, 79–80, 209, 211, 242, 244 The new editions of his works enlisted the collaboration of Sămănătorist intellectuals Ilarie Chendi and Ștefan Octavian Iosif.Braga, p. 215 Tudor Vianu however noted that, unlike Eminescu's outlook, Creangă's \\"authentic ruralism\\" did not complement the \\"spiritual complications\\", global social class perspective and intellectual background associated with these trends, making Creangă \\"the least Sămănătorist among our writers.\\"Vianu, Vol. II, p. 213–214 According to Ornea, Creangă has \\"nothing in common\\" with the Sămănătorul ideology in particular: while the group shared his nostalgic outlook on the rural past in stark contrast to the modernized world, the Moldavian author could \\"maintain, intelligently, the middle ground between contraries\\". Likewise, Mircea Braga reacted against the perception of Creangă as announcing a \\"series\\" of authors, noting that, for all imitation, he was \\"an exceptional and, as far as Romanian literary history goes, unique creator.\\"Braga, p. 213 Directly influenced by Creangă, several early 20th century and interwar authors within the new traditionalist trend explicitly stood for the legacy of folkloric, spontaneous and unskilled literature: the peasant writer I. Dragoslav, whose memoirs borrow stylistic elements from Creangă's accounts; Constantin Sandu-Aldea, an agriculturalist by profession, who took inspiration from his techniques of rendering dialogue; and Ion Iovescu, whom the Sburătorul literary circle acclaimed as \\"a new Creangă\\", and who made ample use of a modernized Muntenian dialect.Călinescu, p. 635, 726, 930 Similarly, the Aromanian activist and author Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, who divided his career between Romania and the southern Balkans, combined Creangă's storytelling techniques with the traditions of Turkish literature,Kemal H. Karpat, \\"The Memoirs of N. Batzaria: The Young Turks and Nationalism\\", in Studies on Ottoman Social and Political History, Brill Publishers, Leiden, Boston & Cologne, 2002, p. 565\\\\. while the reworking of regional folklore themes earned intellectual Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor a reputation as \\"the Oltenian Creangă\\".Aurelian I. Popescu, postface to Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor, Tivisoc și Tivismoc, Scrisul Românesc, Craiova, 1987, p. 145 During the 1910s, folklorist Tudor Pamfile published a specialized magazine named Ion Creangă in honor of the writer.Agnes Murgoci, \\"The Vampire in Roumania\\", in Alan Dundes, The Vampire: A Casebook, University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, 1998, p. 16sqq. Creangă's various works also provided starting points for several other writers of diverse backgrounds. They included representatives of the Symbolist movement, such as Victor Eftimiu, who was inspired by Creangă's narrative style in writing his fantasy and verse play Înșir'te mărgărite.Călinescu, p. 714 Another such author was poet Elena Farago, whose didactic children's story Într-un cuib de rândunică (\\"Inside a Swallow's Nest\\") borrows from \\"The Flax and the Shirt\\".Călinescu, p. 705 With the interwar period and the spread of modernist literature, a new generation of critics, most notably George Călinescu and Vladimir Streinu, dedicated important segments of their activity to the works of Ion Creangă.Ornea (1998), p. 238 Other such figures were Șerban Cioculescu, whose contribution attempts to elucidate the more mysterious parts of the writer's vocabulary, and educator Dumitru Furtună, whose biographical studies provided a main source for subsequent research. By then, interest in Creangă's life and writings had diversified. This phenomenon first touched Romanian theater when I. I. Mironescu dramatized a section of Creangă's Memories as Catiheții de la Humulești (\\"The Catechists from Humulești\\")—a literary contribution judged \\"superfluous\\" by George Călinescu, who noted that the original was already \\"dramatic\\" in style.Călinescu, p. 785 The writer's stories also became an inspiration for Alfred Mendelsohn and Alexandru Zirra, two Romanian composers who worked in children's musical theater, who adapted, respectively, \\"Harap Alb\\" and \\"The Goat and Her Three Kids\\".Viorel Cosma, \\"From the Musical Folklore of Children to the Comic Opera for Children\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 30/2007 Creangă was also a secondary presence in Mite and Bălăuca, two biographical novels centered on Eminescu's amorous life, written by the prominent interwar critic Eugen Lovinescu, to whom Călinescu reproached having largely ignored Creangă in his nonfictional texts.Călinescu, p. 801, 807 Creangă's writings also earned followers among the more radical wing of the modernist scene. The authenticity and originality of Creangă's prose were highlighted and treasured by the influential modernist venue Contimporanul, in particular by its literary chroniclers Ion Vinea and Benjamin Fondane.Cernat, p. 76, 143, 200–201 Likewise, while formally affiliating with Surrealism, the avant-garde author Ion Călugăru contributed various prose works which borrow some of Creangă's storytelling techniques to depict the lives of Jewish Romanian communities from Moldavia.Cernat, p. 76, 143 In stages after World War I, the 19th century writer became better known to an international audience. This process produced translations into English, some of which, Călinescu argued, reached significant popularity among British readers of Romanian literature. In contrast, writer Paul Bailey assessed that the variants used antiquated words and \\"sounded terrible\\" in English. Marius Chivu, \\" 'O, țară tristă, plină de humor! De asta iubesc România' \\" (interview with Paul Bailey) , in Dilema Veche, Vol. III, Nr. 110, March 2006 Among the series of early English-language versions was a 1920 edition of Creangă's Memories, translated by Lucy Byng and published by Marcu Beza.\\"Marcu Beza\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 21/2004 It was also during the interwar that Jean Boutière published the first-ever French-language monograph on the Romanian writer, originally as a Ph.D. thesis for the University of Paris. While their author continued to receive praise for his main contributions, the erotic tales were most often kept hidden from the public eye. George Călinescu summarized this contrast by stating: \\"The 'corrosives' left by Creangă are not known publicly.\\" An exception to this rule was Kirileanu's Creangă reader of 1938, published by Editura Fundațiilor Regale as the first critical edition of his entire literature. According to critic Adrian Solomon, the Romanian tradition of silencing obscene language and sexually explicit literature through censorship made \\"The Tale of All Tales\\" circulate \\"rather like a samizdat\\", which left writers with \\"no solid tradition to draw on, and precious little chance to evade ... the vigilant morals of a straitlaced public.\\"Adrian Solomon, \\"Loosening the Lace\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 26/2005 The nationalist aspects of Ion Creangă's public discourse were however approved of and recovered by the far right of the 1920s and '30s. High-ranking Orthodox cleric Tit Simedrea referred to Creangă as a predecessor when, in 1937, he urged his congregation to refrain from purchasing merchandise sold by Jews (a measure which he believed was a practical alternative to the Jews' forced eviction). In 1939, as part of a press campaign targeting Călinescu's work, the fascist journal Porunca Vremii accused the literary historian of having exposed Creangă's biography for the sake of compromising the \\"genial Moldavian\\" by turning him into \\"an unfrocked epileptic and a drunk.\\"Ornea (1995), p. 443 Creangă inspired a 1920 painting by Octav Băncilă, which shows Creangă listening to Eminescu reading his poems. Cornel Munteanu, \\"Mihai Eminescu în iconografia românilor\\", in Foaia Românească, February 2006 Two busts of the author were erected in Iași, respectively at his grave site and, in 1932, the gardens of Copou neighborhood. Constantin Ostap, \\"Grădina busturilor rătăcite\\", in Ziarul de Iași, August 5, 2008 After 1943, another such piece was unveiled in Bucharest's Cișmigiu Gardens, as part of Rotunda Scriitorilor monument.Narcis Dorin Ion, \\"Nature and Architecture: The Parks and Gardens of the Capital\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 32/2008 =Under communism= Lev Averbruh's bust of Ion Creangă (Alley of Classics, Chișinău) During Romania's restrictive communist period, which lasted between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă's work went through several periods, complementing political developments. Throughout the first part of this interval, when socialist realism was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous censorship which affected several other classical writers (see Censorship in Communist Romania). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with the condemned Junimea was omitted from critical commentary, and readers were instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of bourgeois society. Ion Simuț, \\"Canonul literar proletcultist\\", in România Literară, Nr. 27/2008 (republished by România Culturală) In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the Romanian Academy. Membrii post-mortem al Academiei Române, at the Romanian Academy site The following year, at the height of Soviet occupation, official critic Barbu Lăzăreanu controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to Russian folklore. Ioana Pârvulescu, \\"Nimeni nu poate sări peste umbra epocii lui\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 23/2009 By the second half of communist rule, several new approaches in the critical assessment of Creangă's literature were emerging. His work became a main topic of critical interest and the sole subject of many works, to the point where Nicolae Manolescu assessed that \\"everything has been said about Creangă\\".Braga, p. 199–200 Within this exegetic phenomenon, an original interpretation of his stories from an esoteric perspective was written by philosopher Vasile Lovinescu as Creangă și Creanga de aur (\\"Creangă and the Golden Bough\\"). Iulian Băicuș, \\"Despre mitocritică, mitanaliză, arhetipuri și alți demoni critici\\" (III), in Contrafort, Nr. 11-12/2006 During the final two decades of communism, under Nicolae Ceaușescu, the recovery of nationalist discourse into official dogma also encouraged the birth of Protochronism. In one of its aspects, theorized by cultural historian Edgar Papu, this approach controversially reevaluated various Romanian writers, Creangă included, presenting them as figures who anticipated most developments on the world stage.Boia (2001), pp. 79–81; Mihăilescu, pp. 149, 153, 158, 171 Papu's own conclusion about \\"Harap Alb\\", outlined in a 1983 volume, depicted Creangă as a direct predecessor of Italian semiotician Umberto Eco and his celebrated volume The Open Work—a conclusion which literary historian Florin Mihăilescu has seen as proof of Papu's \\"exegetic obsession\\", lacking in \\"sense of humor, not just sense of reality.\\"Mihăilescu, p. 158 One of Papu's disciples, national communist ideologue Dan Zamfirescu, claimed that Creangă was equal to, or even more important than world classics Homer, William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, while asserting that the eponymous protagonist of \\"Ivan Turbincă\\" stands as \\"the character who dominates world history in our century\\".Boia (2001), p. 80 Left outside the scope of this critical interest, the \\"corrosives\\" were left out of new Creangă readers (such as Iorgu Iordan's 1970 edition), being, according to a 1976 essay by scholar George Munteanu, \\"still unpublishable\\" for lack of \\"a general level of aesthetic education\\" among Romanians.Braga, p. 199 A second museum entirely dedicated to the writer was opened at his Târgu Neamț home in 1951, \\"Muzeul Memorial Ion Creangă\\", entry in Complexul Muzeal Județean Neamț database; retrieved August 3, 2009 and donated to the state by his successors in 1965.

Among the first were two contributions of filmmaker Elisabeta Bostan, both released in the early 1960s and based on the Memories: Amintiri din copilărie (starring child actor Ion Bocancea as the young Nică and Ștefan Ciubotărașu as the grown-up narrator), and Pupăza din tei (focusing on the hoopoe story). In 1965, celebrated Romanian director Ion Popescu-Gopo released De-aș fi Harap Alb, a loose adaptation of \\"Harap Alb\\", starring Florin Piersic in the title role. Popescu-Gopo also directed the 1976 film Povestea dragostei, which was based on \\"The Story of the Pig\\" and the 1985 film \\"Ramasagul\\" which was based on \\"The Bag with 2 Coins\\". The series also includes Nicolae Mărgineanu's biographical film of 1989, Un bulgăre de humă, focuses on the friendship between Creangă (played by Dorel Vișan) and Eminescu (Adrian Pintea). Gabriela Lupu, \\"Adrian Pintea, un actor extraordinar și un profesor desavîrșit\\", in Cotidianul, June 8, 2007 The legacy of Ion Creangă was also tangible in the Soviet Union, and especially in the Moldavian SSR (which, as the larger section of Bessarabia, had been part of interwar Greater Romania, and later became independent Moldova). Initially, his writings, titled Moldavian Stories, formed part of the Soviet curriculum in the Moldavian Autonomous Region (Transnistria).Charles Upson Clark, Bessarabia. Russia and Roumania on the Black Sea: Chapter XXIX, \\"The Moldavian Soviet Republic\\", at the University of Washington's DXARTS/CARTAH Electronic Text Archive; retrieved August 16, 2009 Following the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, Creangă was one of the Romanian-language writers whose works were still allowed for publishing by the new authorities.

The endorsement of Creangă's public image within the Moldavian SSR was also reflected in art: in 1958, the writer's bust, the work of sculptor Lev Averbruh, was assigned to the Alley of Classics in Chișinău. \\"Busturi / Sculptură și pictură monumentală: Ion Creangă\\", entry in Patrimoniul istoric și arhitectural al Republicii Moldova database; retrieved August 3, 2009 His works were illustrated by one of the Moldavian SSR's leading visual artists, Igor Vieru, who also painted a portrait of the author.

Dan Pricope, \\"Casa lui Creangă scoasă la vânzare\\" , in România Liberă, January 21, 2009 Creangă's name was assigned to several education institutions, among them Bucharest's Ion Creangă National College, and to an annual prize granted by the Romanian Academy. There is an Ion Creangă commune, in Neamț County, and streets or squares were also named in the writer's honor in cities throughout Romania: Târgu Neamț, Iași, Fălticeni, Bucharest, Arad, Brăila, Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Craiova, Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Oradea, Ploiești, Sibiu, Suceava, Târgu Mureș, Tecuci, Timișoara, Tulcea, etc. A quarter in northern Bucharest, near Colentina, is also named Ion Creangă. Creangă's name was assigned to several landmarks and institutions in post- Soviet Moldova. Among them is the Ion Creangă Pedagogical State University, founded on the basis of Chișinău's normal school.

The hotel has been designated as a New York City Historic Landmark. The 181-room hotel, opened in 1902, was designed by architect Goldwin Starrett. It was originally conceived as an apartment hotel but was quickly converted to a traditional lodging establishment. Its first owner- manager, Frank Case (who bought the hotel in 1927), established many of the hotel's traditions. It had a reputation for hosting numerous literary and theatrical notables, including the members of the Algonquin Round Table.  History  The Algonquin Hotel was originally designed as an apartment hotel, whose owner planned to rent rooms and suites on year-long leases. When few leases sold, the owner decided to turn it into a hotel which he was originally going to name \\"The Puritan\\". Frank Case, upon discovering that Algonquian tribes had been the first residents of the area, persuaded the owner to christen it \\"The Algonquin\\" instead.Case 26–27 Case took over the lease on the hotel in 1907Case 37 and bought the property on which the building sat in 1927 for US$1 million.Case 189 Case remained owner and manager of the hotel until his death in June 1946. In October that year, The Algonquin was purchased by Ben Bodne of Charleston, South Carolina for just over US$1 million. Bodne undertook an extensive restoration and renovation effort. Bodne sold the hotel in 1987 to a group of Japanese investors and the Algonquin changed hands a number of times before ending up with Miller Global Properties in 2002. Following a two-year, US$3 million renovation, the hotel was sold again in 2005 to HEI Hospitality. HEI has affiliated it with Marriott International where it is part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection brand.Algonquin Hotel checks in with Marriott International, September 19, 2010, Crain Communications, Inc The Algonquin Round Table : In June 1919 the hotel became the site of the daily meetings of the Algonquin Round Table, a group of journalists, authors, publicists and actors who gathered to exchange bon mots over lunch in the main dining room. The group met almost daily for the better part of ten years. Some of the core members of the \\"Vicious Circle\\" included Franklin P. Adams, Robert Benchley, Heywood Broun, Marc Connelly, Jane Grant, Ruth Hale, George S. Kaufman, Harpo Marx, Neysa McMein, Dorothy Parker, Harold Ross, Robert E. Sherwood and Alexander Woollcott. At the end of World War I, Vanity Fair writers and Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, received a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were also a part of this august assembly; these individuals influenced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day. Frank Case, owner of the hotel, ensured a daily luncheon for the talented group of young writers by treating them to free celery and popovers; more importantly, they were provided with their own table and waiter. Edna Ferber, Franklin P. Adams, George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Marc Connelly eventually joined the group, expanding its membership. All members were affiliated with the Algonquin Round Table, although they referred to themselves as the Vicious Circle. Visitors often request to dine at the actual “round table” where members originally met for decades. The Oak Room The Oak Room at the Algonquin was long one of New York City's premier cabaret nightclubs. Opened in 1939 (as the Oak Room Supper Club), it was soon closed on account of World War II, reopened as a regular venue in 1980, and closed for good in 2012. (Before 1939, it had been called the Pergola Room and was the first meeting place of what became the Algonquin Round Table). Legendary European chanteuse Greta Keller was the room's first star. When Donald Smith reopened the Oak Room in 1980, the first regular and star was singer-pianist Steve Ross. Other performers who have appeared at the Oak Room include Julie Wilson, Mary Cleere Haran, Karen Akers, KT Sullivan, Barbara Carroll, Sandy Stewart, Bill Charlap, Diana Krall, Jessica Molaskey, Jamie Cullumand John Pizzarelli. Andrea Marcovicci performed there over a span of 25 years, sometimes with her mother Helen Marcovicci (né Stuart), becoming effectively an Algonquin institution. The Oak Room helped launch the careers of Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Feinstein. Sylvia Syms collapsed and died on stage there during a performance in 1992. With its oak panels and other decor recalling an earlier time, the heyday of cabaret, the Oak Room was small, intimate, and expensive (at least $100 per person, more if one had dinner, except for matinees), and was not a big moneymaker for the Algonquin. Part of the space occupied by the former Oak Room was used to enlarge the Blue Bar, the rest was converted into a private breakfast room for Marriott Reward Elite customers.  Traditions  = Cats = The hotel has a tradition of keeping a cat that has the run of the hotel. The practice dates to the 1930s, when Frank Case took in a stray male cat that was originally named \\"Rusty.\\" Legend has it that actor John Barrymore, who felt that the cat needed a more \\"dignified\\" name, suggested renaming Rusty \\"Hamlet.\\" Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a cat, all the male cats are named \\"Hamlet\\" while all the female cats are named \\"Matilda.\\" The last Algonquin cat, a Matilda, to gain notice was a Ragdoll that was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester (New York) Cat Show. Visitors could spot Matilda on her personal chaise longue in the lobby; she could also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on the front desk, or lounging on a baggage cart. The doormen fed her and the general manager's executive assistant answered Matilda's e-mail. During 2011, Matilda was temporarily confined to an upper floor or to the limits of a leash tethered to the check- in desk, due to a directive from the city Department of Health.today.msnbc.msn.com From late 2011, Matilda was confined to the non- food areas of the lobby by an electronic pet fence. Matilda III died in October, 2017. Since then, Hamlet VIII has taken up shelter at the hotel having been rescued from a cat colony on Long Island. Since the 1930s the hotel holds an annual feline fashion show every summer, which in 2018 was a fundraiser for the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals. = Cocktails = Although the Algonquin was \\"dry\\" even before Prohibition (Case closed the hotel bar in 1917Case 172 and had harsh words for those who ran speakeasiesCase 175–7), the hotel does have an eponymous cocktail, composed of rye whiskey, Noilly Prat and pineapple juice. More recently, a newer drink has hit the Algonquin's menu, the $10,000 Martini or \\"Martini on the Rock,\\" consisting of a martini of the buyer's choice with a single piece of \\"ice,\\" a diamond, at the bottom of the glass. The martini was developed to mark completion of a major 29-day renovation that closed the hotel for the first time since its opening, which was overseen by Anthony Melchiorri, of Hotel Impossible. Hoy Wong was a notable bartender at the hotel and was the oldest person to hold such a position in the state, serving at the Algonquin for 30 years until retiring in 2009, past the age of 90. = Lunch discounts for struggling writers = In keeping with Frank Case's long-standing tradition of sending popovers and celery to the more impoverished members of the Round Table, the Algonquin offers lunch discounts to struggling writers. Formerly, writers on tour could stay one night at the hotel free in exchange for an autographed copy of their book, although the practice has been amended to include a discount on standard room rates. Landmark status The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark. The hotel was so designated in 1987. In 1996 the hotel was designated a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA. The organization's bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel.

The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway enters Galveston Bay here. Galveston Bay is at left in this photograph. View is to the northeast. Port Bolivar ( ) is an unincorporated community located on the northern shore of the western tip of the Bolivar Peninsula, separated from Galveston Island by the entrance to Galveston Bay. The Bolivar Peninsula itself is a census-designated place, in Galveston County, Texas, and part of the metropolitan area. The entire peninsula was severely damaged during Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008; re- building efforts were still continuing as late as 2013. The US Census does not consider Port Bolivar as a separate community, so any population numbers are estimates from unofficial sources. The estimate suggested by City-Data was 1,349 as of 2013. One real estate site suggested 1,477 as of 2014, while another indicated 1,907 as of July 1, 2015. The community is home to the historic Bolivar Lighthouse, which once guided ships entering Galveston Bay. History Damage caused by Hurricane Ike in 2008 In 1819, James Long based his operations in the area where Port Bolivar would eventually be located. In 1838, Samuel D Parr surveyed the land, and it was granted to him by the Republic of Texas to be called Parrsville. It changed hands as Archibald Wynns and William Lawrence bought the land and developed it. The land was later bought by a company and renamed to Port Bolivar in 1893. Fort Travis is on the southern shore of the Bolivar Peninsula, adjacent to Port Bolivar. Originally the site of the Confederate Fort Green, with a different Fort Travis located on Galveston Island, this Fort Travis started construction in 1898 and adopted the name from the Galveston Island fort. The new fort had its own railroad spur. The 1915 Galveston hurricane damaged Port Bolivar, and its port was mostly not rebuilt. Until the Second World War, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway served the length of the peninsula, extending as far west as Port Bolivar, and provided a ferry service to Galveston for railcars. In 1942, the rail service was cut back to High Island, east, where the Bolivar Peninsula expands onto the full mainland. The rails on the Bolivar Peninsula were scrapped for the war effort. After Hurricane Ike, the United States Postal Service temporarily relocated Port Bolivar post office box services to Winnie, Texas, north of High Island.\\"Postal Service Relocates Services, Deploys Portable Buildings .\\" United States Postal Service.

Religion  The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston maintains the nearby Our Lady By The Sea Chapel and Catholic Center in Crystal Beach. Its service area is the entire peninsula. This site is a part of the Holy Family Parish, which has other sites on Galveston Island. Our Mother of Mercy Church established circa 1950, was previously in Port Bolivar. John Nova Lomax of the Houston Press wrote that the church \\"was the site of many marriages and funerals for generations of Bolivarians.\\" It closed after Hurricane Ike in 2008. At the end of its life, its congregation numbered 75, although in summer months vacationers also attended church there. Lomax described it as \\"a dowdy, declining parish\\". Archbishop Joseph Fiorenza had it razed, despite the lack of damage from the hurricane. The archdiocese argued that keeping the structure would cause further expenses, and that future weather issues could damage the building. Lomax wrote \\"the archdiocese viewed the church as old and in the way\\". Between Hurricane Ike and the opening of Our Lady by the Sea, Bolivar residents attended church in Galveston or in Winnie. John Nova Lomax of the Houston Press wrote that the Our Lady church, dedicated in 2010 and on the site of the former St Therese of Lisieux, \\"effectively consolidates [St Therese of Lisieux in Crystal Beach] and [Our Mother of Mercy]\\". Residents opposed to the demolition of Our Mother of Mercy expressed a negative reception to the opening of Our Lady by the Sea.

It is located east of the government and business district. The Market district includes the market buildings and open-air market along George, York, ByWard, and William street. The district is bordered westwardly by Sussex Drive and Mackenzie Avenue, and eastwardly by Cumberland Street. It stretches northwards to Cathcart Street, while to the south it is bordered by Rideau Street.ByWard Market Business Association The name refers to the old 'By Ward' of the City of Ottawa ('By' deriving from the surname of the engineer, Lt-Colonel John By, who was the area's original surveyor). The district comprises the main commercial part of the historic Lower Town area of Ottawa. According to the Canada 2011 Census, the population of the area was 3,063.Population calculated by combining Dissemination area 35060252, 35060251, 35061789, 35061790, 35061788 and Dissemination Blocks 3506025306, 3506025505, 3506025405 and 3506025406 and removing 3506178812 The market itself is regulated by a City of Ottawa municipal services corporation named Marchés d'Ottawa Markets, which also operates the smaller west-end Parkdale Market. The corporation is run by a nine-member board of directors. The market building is open year-round, and open-air stalls offering fresh produce and flowers are operated in the warmer months. Neighbourhood Map of the east-end of Downtown Ottawa Sussex Drive by the Market Traditionally, the ByWard Market area has been a focal point for Ottawa's French and Irish communities. The large Catholic community supported the construction of the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica, one of the largest and oldest Roman Catholic churches in Ottawa. The shape of the cathedral was taken into account in the design of the National Gallery of Canada, which was built across Sussex Drive. The ByWard Market has been an area of constant change, adapting to the increasingly cosmopolitan nature of downtown Ottawa, as well as trends in Canadian society as a whole. Recently, a multitude of restaurants and specialty food stores have sprouted around the market area, making this neighbourhood one of the liveliest in Ottawa outside of normal business hours. A four-block area around the market provides the densest concentration of eating places, bars, and nightclubs in the National Capital Region. The areas beyond this zone also offer boutiques and restaurants in abundance, and are frequented by a considerable number of buskers. Having acquired a reputation as the city's premier bar district, the Byward Market is thronged (brimming) at night with university students and other young adults. Condominium construction in the ByWard Market Over the years, the city has developed five open-air courtyards immediately east of Sussex Drive, stretching from Saint Patrick Street to George Street. These cobblestone courtyards are filled with flowers, park benches, fountains, and sculptures. Several of the houses surrounding them are historic buildings. On the west side of Sussex Drive is the United States Embassy. The building's design, by noted architect David Childs, was supposedly widely criticized by surrounding residents, as one particular Ottawa Sun newspaper article reported that the bronze building- block sculpture created by Joel Shapiro and dedicated by Hillary Clinton was \\"glaringly and gratingly American\\", whereas some critics declared that the building's new design \\"reflected a cautious world view\\". Jeanne D'Arc Court, the courtyard at George and Sussex The neighbourhood today is markedly heterogeneous; being visited by a mix of young professionals, many families, and some homeless people. At one time, the area had had a serious prostitution problem, which was remedied by a controversial rerouting of traffic through much of the residential area. The area is mainly English-speaking, but there exists a significant francophone population as well. The Market is located in close proximity to the downtown Rideau Centre shopping mall, to Parliament Hill, and to a number of foreign embassies. History and evolution of the ByWard Market In 1826, Lieutenant Colonel John By of the Royal Engineers was sent from England to oversee the construction of the Rideau canal system, which was designed to connect the Ottawa River to Kingston, via the St. Lawrence River. It was out of this massive project that the small community of Bytown grew into a flourishing commercial and economic centre. Colonel By prepared plans for two village sites: one on the west side of the Rideau Canal, which was known as Upper Town; and one to the east of the canal, called Lower Town. The land was cleared and surveyed. Both villages were laid out in a grid system and divided into building lots. The Village of Lower Town was originally bounded by the Rideau River, and Sussex, Clarence, and Rideau Street; additionally, this town plan included an area designated as a commercial section within the block bounded by George, Sussex, York, and King Street. However, most of the Lower Town site was covered with swampland, which had to be drained; excess water from the canal was released through a sluice gate, which became known as the By Wash: it ran through Lower Town and emptied into the Rideau River; for this reason, as well as to leave room for a proposed market building and courthouse, Lt. Col. By designed both George and York Street to be wide. From the beginning, Bytown was divided. Not only physically, by the canal, but also ethnically, politically, and economically: where Upper Town was settled by officers, tradesmen, and professionals, most of whom were Protestants and Anglicans of English or Scottish descent, Lower Town was settled by labourers who had come to Bytown seeking employment during the building of the canal; these inhabitants were mainly Catholic Irish immigrants and French Canadians. In 1827, the two towns were connected along Rideau Street by Sappers Bridge, which spanned the canal. =First Market= In 1827, Colonel By used £160 of revenue from property rents to build a market building with a courthouse behind it on George Street. This was the original market building, large for the time, and constructed of timber with dovetailed corners, a veranda on each side, and an attached weighing machine. This building served both as a centre for market activities, and as a public hall for political and religious meetings. In the 1830s, Lower Town enjoyed a period of rapid commercial growth. Stores of every description, hotels, taverns and industrial buildings sprang up all around the market area. The first sawmill in Bytown was erected on York Street and was driven by the waters of the By Wash. Soon Lower Town became commercially dominant. The market on George Street quickly began to do a flourishing business providing lumber camps with supplies. Farm communities shipped goods up the Ottawa River or along the Rideau waterway to merchants in the Lower Town Market. A large butchering and meatpacking industry developed on the south side of George Street across from the market. This became known as the \\"Butcher's Shambles\\". Around 1840, a public well was opened in the market square. Lower Town had become an established commercial and residential centre. In 1842 the market building and the courthouse in the centre of George Street were dismantled. However, the market area continued to operate in a haphazard way around the remains of the old market building. The mixed farming of the surrounding region was dependent on Bytown for the distribution of its agricultural goods, and the local community required a market to sustain its growth. When Bytown was incorporated as a town on July 28, 1847, the new city council recognized the need for an organized market area, and made this one of their first priorities. =Second Market= The debate for the site of the market began almost as soon as the first council was elected. Lower Town had the political advantage, since it was entitled to four councillors out of seven elected. Lower Town enjoyed several other advantages over Upper Town for the site of a market building. Lower Town was linked with the outlying farming areas that extended from Gloucester Township to Russell and Prescott Counties. Lower Town was already an established commercial centre for goods and its citizens wanted to keep the major services there to prevent a population and economic shift to Upper Town. After extensive discussion, a motion was passed that two markets should be built, one for each town. In Upper Town, Nicholas Sparks offered a piece of his land near Sappers Bridge for the West Ward Market. In Lower Town Mrs. James Inglis donated her property between Clarence and York Streets, which comprised four lots measuring deep by wide. The two sites were approved by council on June 26, 1848. In order to oversee the construction of the two markets a Market Committee was set up. Charles Sparrow, a councillor for Lower Town, became the Chairman of the Committee. The Lower Town Market Building officially opened on Saturday, November 6, 1848. The ceremony was marked by a flag raising, several speeches, and a band which played \\"Rule Britannia\\". This new market building was constructed of wood with room for market stalls on the ground floor and a well-lit upper floor to be used for public meetings. The Upper Town market was converted into a town hall and remained this way until 1878, when it was demolished to make way for a new city hall. In September 1849, the market area was the scene of the \\"Stony Monday Riot\\". The conflict was sparked by the political and religious disputes between Catholic Reformers (in Lower Town) and Protestant Tories (in Upper Town). The controversy came to a head during a non-political reception for the visiting Lord Elgin. During the meeting in the Lower Town market building on September 17, the crowd became agitated. Reformers and Conservatives separated into two groups and a stone-throwing fracas began which lasted about 15 minutes. The group of Conservatives drove the Reformers off of the market square, west along York Street and up Clarence Street where they took refuge behind the fence of L'Esperance's Hotel. Soon after a gun battle began in the market square between the two parties. When the riot was over one man was killed, 30 were wounded and 15 men (all Reformers) were arrested. The Lower Town market continued successfully into the 1850s. Due to overcrowding, it was decided that the market should be expanded. In 1853, four adjoining lots on York and Clarence Streets were purchased for the expansion plan. A bell was purchased and installed by the council in order to regulate the market hours. =Third Market= While the expansion study was underway, the market building was destroyed by fire on January 21, 1862. During the 1860s and early 1870s several other fires hindered the growth of the market area. Fortunately, throughout this time the market continued to function, and the council persevered in its efforts to erect a new market building. In 1864, construction of a new building, designed by architect Sydney B. Fripp, began between Clarence and York Streets. This market building was open in 1865. Although it offered better indoor facilities for vendors, it did not improve the overcrowding outside of the building. From 1840 to 1870, the economic base of Ottawa changed drastically, on account of the removal of the British military, the end of the continental fur trade, and the expansion of the lumber industry. With the opening of the canal and the incorporation of the city in 1855, Ottawa was forced to expand its role as a regional trading centre in agricultural products and services. All of this agricultural and commercial activity was directed through the Byward market area. As a result, the market area was expanded and York, ByWard and William Streets became a hub of commerce. Many industries converged in this area: bakeries, bottling works, a soap and candle factory, a broom manufacturer, as well as carriage and furniture manufacturers. Other businesses operating in the marketplace included retail outlets for agricultural machinery, flour and feed traders, grocery provisioners, hardware suppliers and merchants engaged in similar import/export enterprises. Many service industries also developed, notably saddlers, tailors, carpenters, hostlers, metal and tin workers. In addition butchers, fishmongers, and fresh fruit and vegetable merchants lined the streets facing the market building. (Of these, the Lapointe Fish Market, established in 1867, still operates in the market.) The market building itself was divided into sections for farmers, gardeners, slaughterers, florists, hucksters, livestock dealers, etc. These sections were subdivided into stalls, which were leased annually by the vendors. The vendors were also charged a fee for keeping the market clean. A Market Inspector was appointed to oversee the market area and the public weigh scales. Additionally, a meat inspector had an office in the market building. During this time most merchants resided above their stores, or contained their businesses in sheds to the side or rear of their home. Hotels, taverns and boarding houses also became common on the streets around the market. =Fourth Market= York Street in the ByWard Market circa 1911 Because of constant overcrowding and filth, council proposed an expansion of the market in 1871. Once again Upper and Lower Town were in competition for a market venue. As before, it was decided to construct two buildings; one in Wellington Ward for Upper Town and one between George and York, directly to the south of the existing building in ByWard. On April 14, 1876 the building designed by James Mather was officially opened in the ByWard market. A beautiful edifice in the French style, it stood two storeys high with a mansard roof and an iron cresting finish. Constructed of white brick with limestone dressings, the building was distinguished by two towers which rose over the arched gateway at the south end. Concurrently, the filthy and stagnant By Wash at the southern end of the building was covered over and turned into a proper sewer. The ByWard market continued to flourish into the twentieth century. By now, French-Canadian and Jewish merchants and vendors were becoming the two dominant ethnic cultures in the market area. The market also had to change in order to meet the new demands that accompanied the introduction of modern technologies such as refrigeration and the automobile. The focus of the market was shifting as Rideau Street became an important commercial business area, and department stores were developing and becoming popular. =Fifth Market= The ByWard Market in 2008 In 1926, James Mather's market building was completely destroyed by fire. It was replaced by the building that exists today between George and York Streets. The other stone market building between York and Clarence Streets survived several fires and renovations but was demolished in 1949. By this time parking for automobiles was in short supply, and consequently, the empty block was turned into a parking lot. In 1975 a parking garage was constructed during major renovations of the market area. The side fronting York Street was turned into commercial space, and now houses two restaurants, a produce store and Aubrey's butcher shop, which has been in the market since 1908. Today, the market area still retains much of the flavour of its past. Since the 1840s, the ByWard Market has served as one of the principal hubs of commerce, entertainment and leisure activities in a locale that has been transformed from a remote colonial outpost to the centre of Canada's National Capital Region. Many of the market's original industries and services have given way to boutiques and restaurants. Nevertheless, Ottawa residents and tourists continue to gather in the area to purchase vegetables and groceries, as well as to enjoy the colourful vendors and street entertainment. In October 2000, broadcaster CHUM Limited opened a new studio complex in the ByWard Market at 87 George Street, known as the CHUM MarketMediaMall. CHUM's then-NewNet station CHRO moved its primary operations from its original facilities in Pembroke to the new building (including a Speaker's Corner video booth); the facility also housed CHUM Radio stations CKKL-FM, CJMJ-FM, CFRA-AM and CFGO-AM. The facility came under CTV ownership when CTVglobemedia bought CHUM Limited in 2006, and then under Bell ownership when Bell re-purchased the CTV assets in 2011. When a fire broke out at the studio complex of CTV O&O; CJOH-TV in Nepean in 2010, destroying it, this meant CJOH moved into the MarketMediaMall complex as well. The Market has come under criticism for many years for pushing local farmers out of the market and allowing re-sellers to import produce from around the world. These re-sellers sell produce under the guise of growing it on their own farms. Several studies have exposed this as a problem, but no City Council has dared to change it. As a result, local farmers had to create their own farmer-only market called the Ottawa Farmers' Market, located at Lansdowne Park. That group has gone on to create four other successful markets in the City. In an era when it must compete against slick shopping malls, the ByWard Market has been able to retain its popularity. This may be attributed to the continuance of its original, somewhat unpolished marketplace atmosphere, which prevails essentially unchanged from the Victorian period.

A Rolodex is a rotating file device used to store business contact information. Its name is a portmanteau of the words rolling and index. The name rolodex has become somewhat genericized for any personal organizer performing this function, or as a metonym for the sum total of an individual's accumulated business contacts. Overview The Rolodex holds specially shaped index cards; the user writes or types the contact information for one person or company onto each card. The cards are notched to be able to be snapped in and out of the rotating spindle. Some users tape ordinary business cards directly to the Rolodex index card, or place them in plastic or vinyl sleeves in the shape of Rolodex cards. Some companies produced business cards in the shape of Rolodex cards, as a marketing tactic. The Rolodex was invented in 1956, by the Danish engineer Hildaur Neilsen, the chief engineer of Arnold Neustadter's company Zephyr American, a stationery manufacturer in New York. First marketed in 1958, it was an improvement to an earlier design called the Wheeldex. Zephyr American also invented, manufactured and sold the Autodex, a spring- operated phone directory that automatically opened to the selected letter, Swivodex, an inkwell that did not spill, Punchodex, a paper hole puncher, and Clipodex, an office aid that attached to a stenographer's knee.

All 97 episodes (55 minutes each), which were shot in black-and-white and first broadcast between 1969 and 1976, were written by Herbert Reinecker and starred Erik Ode as Kommissar Herbert Keller. Keller's assistants were Walter Grabert (Günther Schramm), Robert Heines (Reinhard Glemnitz), and Harry Klein (Fritz Wepper) who, in 1974, was replaced by his younger brother (also in real life) Erwin Klein (Elmar Wepper).  History  Today considered cult television, Der Kommissar had many of the ingredients of the whodunnit: a murder victim, often unidentified at first; a group of suspects who gradually emerge as the police gather all the evidence available to them; and a police detective who, by sheer reasoning, figures out all by himself who the murderer is, while he has his assistants do all the legwork. In some episodes, Kommissar Keller even asks everyone to gather at the scene of the crime so that he, in the manner of Hercule Poirot, can reconstruct the events leading up to, and following, the killing so that the murderer can eventually be arrested. In Der Kommissar, author Herbert Reinecker neatly captures the zeitgeist of the late 1960s and early 1970s by presenting many young characters that are involved in a crime. These young people usually wear trendy clothes and listen to the songs from the hit parade, be it at home or in seedy pubs, night clubs, or discotheques. In Reinecker's world, a young girl who leaves her parents and moves from the country to the anonymous and evil big city--Munich--will necessarily end up as either a prostitute, or a drug addict, or a murder victim, or all of the above. Also, at a time of shifting moral standards in the wake of the Sexual Revolution, Keller can only shake his head--only inwardly though--at the follies of middle-aged bourgeois people who think they can practise what today would be called a polyamorous relationship and get away with it unscathed. As a matter of fact Der Kommissar is full of bizarre relationships: There is the middle-aged wife of an academic who starts an affair with the young waiter of the local restaurant although the latter lives in a rented room and his landlady sees and hears everything; there is the wealthy entrepreneur who takes a liking to the attractive wife of his live-in servant and who arranges for her to spend the nights with him upstairs in the master bedroom; and there is the mother of a teenage daughter who, whenever her husband is working the night shift, sleeps with a boy the same age as her daughter. However, Kommissar Keller's ways are also rather contentious by today's standards. He is hardly ever seen without a burning cigarette; he regularly drinks on duty; and he addresses everyone who works in his office with du but at the same time expects them to use the much more formal Sie when talking to him. Keller justifies that habit of his in his very first conversation with Erwin Klein (1974): Ich muss dir gleich etwas sagen. Ich habe vielleicht die etwas schlechte Angewohnheit, meine Mitarbeiter bei der täglichen Arbeit zu duzen. Und das ärgert manche Leute, die finden das nicht richtig und die halten das für autoritär, das ist natürlich vollkommener Quatsch mit Soße. Ich duze euch, weil ihr mir näher steht als alle anderen und weil es vielleicht ein bisschen zu spät sein dürfte, mich jetzt noch zu ändern. Begreifst du das? I have to tell you one thing right away. I may have the bad habit of duzen (using the informal address \\"du\\" to) my work colleagues in our daily job. Some people are annoyed by that, they don't think it's right, they think it's authoritarian. This is baloney of course. I duze (use the informal address \\"du\\" to) you because you are closer to me than anyone else and because it may be a bit too late for me to change. Do you understand? Over the years, an impressive number of guest actors and actresses appeared on the show, with even the odd UFA star among them. The guests were, to name just a few, Heinz Bennent (twice), Anton Diffring, Hannelore Elsner (twice), Peter van Eyck, Götz George (three times), Raimund Harmstorf, Johannes Heesters, Paul Hubschmid, Gottfried John, Curd Jürgens (twice), Christine Kaufmann, Helmut Käutner, Marianne Koch, Christiane Krüger (three times), Ruth Leuwerik, Lilli Palmer, Eric Pohlmann (twice), Wolfgang Preiss, Charles Régnier (three times), Heinz Reincke (twice), Walter Rilla, Maria Schell (three times), Nadja Tiller, Margarethe von Trotta (three times), Karl Michael Vogler, Bernhard Wicki (twice) and Sonja Ziemann. In 1974, two years before the final episode of The Kommissar was broadcast, Reinecker launched a new series, Derrick, establishing some kind of continuity by promoting Harry Klein, now Derrick's assistant, to the post of Inspektor (in the same building, \\"just down the corridor\\").

Dulles served on the faculty of Woodstock College from 1960 to 1974, of the Catholic University of America from 1974 to 1988, and as the Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society at Fordham University from 1988 to 2008. He was an internationally-known author and lecturer. Early life Dulles was born in Auburn, New York, on August 24, 1918, the son of John Foster Dulles, the future U.S. Secretary of State (for whom Washington Dulles International Airport is named), and Janet Pomeroy Avery Dulles. His uncle was Director of Central Intelligence Allen Welsh Dulles. Both his great-grandfather John W. Foster and great-uncle Robert Lansing also served as secretary of state. His paternal grandfather, Allen Macy Dulles, was a member of the faculty of Auburn Theological Seminary and published in the field of ecclesiology, to which his grandson would likewise devote scholarly attention as a Catholic. He received his primary school education in New York City at the St. Bernard's School and attended secondary schools in Switzerland and the Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut. He then enrolled at Harvard College in 1936. Dulles was raised a Presbyterian but had become an agnostic by the time he was a student at Harvard.Biography of Avery Dulles , Catholic Pages.com His religious doubts were diminished during a personally profound moment when he stepped out into a rainy day and saw a tree beginning to flower along the Charles River; after that moment he never again \\"doubted the existence of an all-good and omnipotent God.\\"Royal, Robert \\"Avery Dulles's Long Road to Rome\\" , Crisis Magazine July–August 2001 He noted how his theism turned toward conversion to Catholicism: \\"The more I examined, the more I was impressed with the consistency and sublimity of Catholic doctrine.\\" He converted to Catholicism in the fall of 1940. After both winning the Phi Beta Kappa Essay PrizeAvery Dulles (1941), Princeps Concordiae: Pico della Mirandola and the Scholastic Tradition – The Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Prize Essay for 1940, Cambridge, MA: Harvard. and graduating from Harvard in 1940, Dulles spent a year and a half at Harvard Law School, during which time he founded the \\"St. Benedict Center\\". (The center later became well known due to the controversial Jesuit priest Leonard Feeney.) He served in the United States Navy during World War II, attaining the rank of Lieutenant. For his liaison work with the French Navy, Dulles was awarded the French Croix de guerre. Society of Jesus and elevation to cardinal Upon his discharge from the navy in 1946, Dulles entered the Society of Jesus, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1956. After a year in Germany, he studied ecclesiology under the American Jesuit Francis A. Sullivan at the Gregorian University in Rome, and was awarded the doctorate of sacred theology in 1960. Dulles served on the faculty of Woodstock College from 1960 to 1974, and at the Catholic University of America from 1974 to 1988. He was a visiting professor at the Gregorian University (Rome), Weston School of Theology, Union Theological Seminary (New York), Princeton Theological Seminary, Virginia Theological Seminary, Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, Boston College, Campion Hall, Oxford, the University of Notre Dame, the Catholic University at Leuven, Yale University, and St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie. He was the author of over 700 articles on theological topics, as well as twenty-two books. In 1994, he was a signer of the document Evangelicals and Catholics Together. Past president of both the Catholic Theological Society of America and the American Theological Society, and professor emeritus at the Catholic University of America, Dulles served on the International Theological Commission and as a member of the United States Lutheran/Roman Catholic Dialogue. Dulles was critical of dual- covenant theology, especially as understood in the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' document Reflections on Covenant and Mission.\\"Covenant and Mission\\", America Magazine He was a consultant to the Committee on Doctrine of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Although Jesuits make a promise not to pursue ecclesiastical dignities and do not normally accept promotion within the Church hierarchy, Dulles was created a cardinal on February 21, 2001, by Pope John Paul II. He was not made a bishop, as is normally the case, as the pope had granted him a dispensation. His titular church and assignment was as Cardinal-Deacon of SS. Nome di Gesù e Maria in Via Lata. Because he had reached the age of 80 before becoming cardinal, Dulles was never eligible to vote in a conclave. Dulles became an honorary, non-voting member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Honors and awards Dulles' awards included Phi Beta Kappa, the Croix de Guerre, the Cardinal Spellman Award for distinguished achievement in theology, the Boston College Presidential Bicentennial Award, the Christus Magister Medal from the University of Portland (Oregon), the Religious Education Forum Award from the National Catholic Educational Association, America magazine's Campion Award, the F. Sadlier Dinger Award for contributions to the catechetical ministry of the Church, the James Cardinal Gibbons Award from The Catholic University of America, the John Carroll Society Medal, the Jerome Award from the Roman Catholic Library Association of America, Fordham Founders Award, Gaudium Award from the Breukelein Institute, and thirty-three honorary doctorates. Farewell address and death In his later years, the cardinal suffered from the effects of polio he had contracted in his youth. On April 1, 2008, Cardinal Dulles gave his farewell address as Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society. As Dulles was unable to speak, the former president of Fordham University, Father Joseph O'Hare, S.J., read his address. In addition to the loss of speech, the use of his arms was impaired but his mind remained clear and he continued to work and communicate using his computer keyboard.Imbelli, Robert P. A Visit with Avery Dulles Commonweal, June 1, 2008 Current Fordham President Father Joseph McShane, S.J. also presented him with the University's President's Medal that evening. April 1, 2008 also marked the date the Cardinal's book, Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures, 1988–2007 (Fordham University Press, 2008) was released. In his Farewell Lecture, the cardinal reflected on his weakening condition: > Suffering and diminishment are not the greatest of evils but are normal > ingredients in life, especially in old age. They are to be expected as > elements of a full human existence. Well into my 90th year I have been able > to work productively. As I become increasingly paralyzed and unable to > speak, I can identify with the many paralytics and mute persons in the > Gospels, grateful for the loving and skillful care I receive and for the > hope of everlasting life in Christ. If the Lord now calls me to a period of > weakness, I know well that his power can be made perfect in infirmity. > \\"Blessed be the name of the Lord!\\" On April 19, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI paid a visit to the ailing Cardinal Dulles during his visit to the United States.

Hoi Ha Wan. Wan Tsai peninsula bordering Hoi Ha Wan. Hoi Ha Wan () or Jone's Cove is a bay at the north of Sai Kung Peninsula. It is part of Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park, a marine park in Hong Kong. The village of Hoi Ha is located on the innermost shore of Hoi Ha Wan. The location has a high biological value, as it shows significant biodiversity. That is because the Park is a sheltered bay with pristine water quality, so that it provides a good marine environment for housing a great variety of marine organisms. Numerous kinds of corals can be ascertained under the sea, and it is a hot spot for diving. So as to keep the local ecosystems away from human intervention, fishing, particularly bottom trawling and uses of dynamites or poisons like cyanides, collecting sea products and corals are prohibited by law. Geography Covering an area of around , the seaward boundary of the park is demarcated by linking the tips of Heung Lo Kok and Kwun Tsoi Kok through the northern end of Flat Island (Ngan Chau) and Moon Island (Mo Chau). The landward boundary follows the high-water mark along the coastline. The Wan Tsai peninsula forms the western seashore of Hoi Ha Wan.

History There are also the remnants of limekilns. There are total of four lime kilns in Hoi Ha Wan but only two remain comparatively intact. They are located on the eastern shore of inner Hoi Ha Wan. The lime kiln industry was one of the oldest industries (1800–1939) in Hong Kong, which refined lime from either oyster shells or coral skeletons for construction and agricultural uses. In the processes, limestone, i.e. calcium carbonate, in the shells and corals would be transformed into calcium oxide by means of heating. Transport Green Minibus stop at Hoi Ha. Hoi Ha Wan can be reached by taking the New Territories Green Minibus route number 7 at Sai Kung Town Centre. The minibus provides service at daytime every day, every 30 minutes. The first bus leaves from Sai Kung at 7:55am, from the bus stop outside the 7-11 convenience store by the pier. The last bus departs from Sai Kung from the same location at 6:25pm.

During the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, he served as an assistant to Karl Rahner, and he was also assistant to Rahner at the Seminar for Christian worldview and philosophy of religion at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich from 1964 to 1967. In 1968 he became professor of dogmatic theology at the University of Mainz, a position he held until 1971 when he became professor of dogmatic and ecumenical theology at the University of Freiburg. He was for ten years, from 1974 to 1984, a member of the International Theological Commission.Cardinal Karl Lehmann, influential German prelate, dies at 81 The Catholic World Report. Retrieved 11 March 2018 Bishop and cardinal When he was appointed Bishop of Mainz in 1983 at the age of 47 he was the youngest Catholic bishop ever appointed in Germany. After being elected deputy chairman of the Episcopal Conference of Germany in 1985, he was elected chairman of the conference in 1987 and held that position for 21 years until 2008, making him one of the most influential people in German Catholicism in this period. He served as member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from 1986 to 1998Pressestelle, Bistum Maintz (11 March 2018 Kardinal Karl Lehmann verstorben Bistum Maintz and served as vice- president of the Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe from 1993 to 2001.Der Mainzer Kardinal Lehmann ist verstorben Kath.net. Retrieved 11 March 2018 In 1993, Lehmann along with Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart Walter Kasper and Archbishop of Freiburg Oskar Saier issued a pastoral letter that argued that there should be an opening for pastoral flexibility on allowing divorced and civilly remarried persons to receive the Eucharist. The letter was read in the churches of their dioceses in September of that year. Abortion was a major issue during Lehmann's term as chairman of the Conference of the German Bishops. After the German reunification abortion laws needed to be reconciled. Working closely with CDU and Helmut Kohl, Lehmann favoured a compromise where abortion remained illegal, but under certain circumstances not punishable. This became the fundament for the German legislation in the area. To obtain impunity, a woman was in most cases required to go through counseling before abortion and the Church would for a time offer such counseling. In 1998 Pope John Paul II, against the wish of Lehmann and a majority of German bishops, banned the Church from participating in the system. Lehmann mentioned the 1998 Katholikentag in Mainz as one of the highlights his years as bishop of the diocese. Lehmann at the closing of Tage der Begegnung, Mainz, 2005 Lehmann was raised to the rank of cardinal by Pope John Paul II at the consistory of 21 February 2001. The appointment came unexpected to many observers due to Lehmann's relatively liberal view on abortion counselling and giving eucharist to remarried parishioners. Former Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl, who was a friend of Lehmann, had lobbied the Vatican for the appointment. He was one of the electors who participated in the papal conclaves of 2005 and 2013 that selected Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis. Lehmann was among the cardinals and bishops who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, to discuss reforms with respect to the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops' conferences, the primacy of the papacy and sexual morality. About a dozen in number, they differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was not the candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave. Pope Francis accepted his resignation as Bishop of Mainz on 16 May 2016, his 80th birthday. Being considered a leading force for a more liberal Catholicism, he was called a bridge-builder, a man of dialogue and a \\"stroke of luck for German Catholics\\" by supporters, while Conservative critics derided the \\"Lehmann Church\\" as too accommodating to modern values. =Coat of arms= Coat of arms Cardinal Lehmann's episcopal coat of arms incorporated elements such as the wheel from the arms of the Diocese of Mainz, the key from the Diocese of Worms, and an open book with the letters Alpha and Omega, a symbol of the message of Jesus Christ, as well as for the Cardinal's personal enthusiasm for literature. His Latin motto, State in fide (English: \\"Stand firmly in the faith\\") was derived from . Later years His last public appearance was in August 2017 at the consecration of Peter Kohlgraf as new bishop of Mainz. In September 2017, Lehmann suffered a stroke and cerebral hemorrhage which left him in need of care, first at hospital and later at home. He died on 11 March 2018. Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel expressed sorrow at his death and referred to him as one of the most prominent figures of the Catholic Church in Germany. The chairman of the German Bishops' Conference Reinhard Marx paid respect to Lehmann as a man who had influenced the Catholic Church globally.Associated Press (11 March 2018)German ex- Catholic head Cardinal Karl Lehmann dies at 81 Fox News.

Founded in 1955, it is part of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The church building of 1964 was designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen (1910-1961) and completed in 1964. Saarinen's father Eliel Saarinen had designed the First Christian Church in Columbus. The building is hexagonal in shape, with a central metal spire that is high. Below the spire, there is an oculus that admits light into the main level. The sanctuary is located at the center of the building, with the Lord's Table located in the center of the sanctuary. Rows of pews surround the altar in a hexagon, reflecting the idea that worship should be a central aspect of the life of the congregation. The lower level contains classrooms, an auditorium, a kitchen, and an activities area. and History In 1955, 43 members of the First Christian Church, designed by Eliel Saarinen, decided to found a new church affiliated with the Disciples of Christ. After some time of worshiping in each other's homes, in 1956 they purchased of land with the help of Irwin Miller. Although Miller wanted to hire Eero Saarinen to design the new church, he believed it was important that the congregation choose the architect themselves: Symbolism in design Saarinen believed that modern churches had lost the monumentality of traditional cathedrals because expansions with Sunday schools, gymnasiums, and kitchens took away from the significance of the church itself. He wanted to design a building that returned to the model of a traditional church, while still using Modern architecture that served the needs of the congregation. His compromise was to move the school, meeting rooms, auditorium, and kitchen to a hidden basement, so that the only visible part of the church above ground was the sanctuary. Space for the basement was carved out of the earth in a hexagonal shape, reflecting the sanctuary above it. This emphasized the importance of the church itself and isolated the sanctuary as the most important part of the building. He was inspired by the steep steps at Angkor Wat and Borobudur, where the visitor has to interact with the architecture and work to reach the sanctuary. He thought that building an entire church on one level made religion \\"too easy\\", and took away from the spiritual experience of going to church. Therefore, he chose to elevate the sanctuary of the church so people had to climb up a set of stairs to reach it. This way the church also stood out from its residential neighborhood. alt= alt= =Sanctuary= The act of entering a church was important to Saarinen as well, so the environment changes to reflect the change of attitude one has when entering a sacred space. The grey slate floors, dark mahogany pews, and eerie natural lighting instill a sense of awe in the visitor. The primary light source into the sanctuary is the oculus at the base of the spire, directly above the Communion table. This focus of light draws attention to the center of the room, where the Communion takes place. The room was designed as a space where people can gather in unity and harmony in an enclosed spiritual world. The Communion table, consisting of twelve pedestals symbolic of the twelve disciples, is placed on a tiered platform. The highest pedestal at the end of the table represents Christ, and hold a silver chalice and loaf of bread for the service. It is the central focus of the sanctuary because it is an important part of the Disciples of Christ service. The congregation sits around it facing each other as a community. The pulpit, choir loft, and a Holtkamp organ is situated opposite the main entrance into the sanctuary. The organ is the last of its kind designed by Walter Holtkamp Sr. =Spire= Saarinen designed the long, angular, symmetrical sanctuary and the tall spire in a single stroke: From the outside of the building, the spire symbolized reaching upwards to God; on the inside, it created an enclosed soaring space for the congregation. The church was intended to remove man from the earthly world, so instead of being anchored to the ground with solid rectangles, Saarinen used pointed angular forms that hover and point to the heavens. At the top of the spire is a gold leaf cross, symbolizing Christ's sacrifice. =Baptistery= The baptistery is a small space, decorated with a sunburst design, symbolizing the Holy Trinity. It is separate from the main sanctuary, designed to give the ceremony more dignity. The separation between the baptistery and sanctuary also recalls the tradition of the Early Christian church, when only those who were baptized could attend Communion. Influence The North Christian Church was one of the most copied buildings from the mid-twentieth century. Although it did not generate much interest during Saarinen's life, the decades that followed produced copies of the building all across the America. It was the last building Saarinen designed before his death, and he thought it was one of his greatest achievements: Recent history As the membership has decreased and upkeep costs have increased, the congregation has begun to have difficulty raising the necessary funds for maintenance of the structure. In April 2018, the Indiana Landmarks historic preservation organization added the church to its list of 10 Most Endangered Indiana landmarks to raise awareness of the problem and find ways to save it. In 2019, Landmark Columbus received a 2019 Keeping it Modern Architectural Conservation Grant from the Getty Foundation for the iconic church. With this grant, Landmark Columbus—together with Prudon & Partners, Reed-Hilderbrand, Bryony Roberts Studio, Enrique Ramirez, ICR-ICC and others—are developing a conservation management plan to provide the historical context and strategic guidance necessary for the church's long-term upkeep.

He served as the inaugural prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy between 2014 and 2019, and was a member of the Council of Cardinal Advisers between 2013 and 2018. Ordained a priest in 1966 and bishop in 1987, he was made a cardinal in 2003. Pell served as the eighth Archbishop of Sydney (2001–2014), the seventh Archbishop of Melbourne (1996–2001) and an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne (1987–1996). He has also been an author, columnist and public speaker. Since 1996, Pell has maintained a high public profile on a wide range of issues, while retaining an adherence to Catholic orthodoxy. Pell worked as a priest in rural Victoria and in Melbourne and also chaired the aid organisation Caritas Australia (part of Caritas Internationalis) from 1988 to 1997. He was appointed as a delegate to the Australian Constitutional Convention in 1998, received the Centenary Medal from the Australian government in 2003 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2005. During his tenure as Archbishop of Melbourne, Pell set up the \\"Melbourne Response\\" protocol in 1996 to investigate and deal with complaints of child sexual abuse in the archdiocese. The protocol was the first of its kind in the world but has been subjected to a variety of criticisms. In 2020, the High Court of Australia overturned the County Court of Victoria's 2018 conviction of Pell on charges of sexual offences and set aside the orders of the Victorian Court of Appeal rejecting appeal.\\"Travesty of justice: 'trusted' institutions fail Pell, public\\", The Australian, 11 April 2020.Guilty verdict:  * Pell remains under separate investigation by the Holy See's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for these allegations of abuse. Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse revealed its findings on Pell in 2020 and found that he knew of child sexual abuse by clergy by the 1970s but did not take adequate action to address it. Pell said he was \\"surprised\\" and that the commission's views \\"are not supported by evidence\\". Early life and education Pell was born on 8 June 1941 in Ballarat, Victoria, to George Arthur and Margaret Lillian (née Burke) Pell. His father was a non-practising Anglican whose ancestors were from Leicestershire in England; he was also a heavyweight boxing champion. His mother was a devout Catholic of Irish descent. As a child, Pell underwent 24 operations to remove an abscess in his throat. Pell attended Loreto Convent and St Patrick's College (from which he matriculated) in Ballarat. At St Patrick's, Pell played Australian rules football as a ruckman on the first XVIII from 1956 to 1959. He signed with the Richmond Football Club in 1959 and played for the club in the VFL reserves. However, his ambitions later turned to the priesthood. Speaking of his decision to become a priest, Pell once said, \\"To put it crudely, I feared and suspected and eventually became convinced that God wanted me to do His work, and I was never able to successfully escape that conviction.\\" In 1960, Pell began his studies for the priesthood at Corpus Christi College, then located in Werribee. He continued to play football and served as class prefect in his second and third years. In 1963, he was assigned to continue his studies at the Pontifical Urban University in Rome. He was ordained to the diaconate on 15 August 1966. Ecclesiastical career =Priesthood= On 16 December 1966, Pell was ordained a priest by Cardinal Gregorio Pietro Agagianian at St. Peter's Basilica. He received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology degree from the Pontificia Università Urbaniana in 1967, and continued his studies at the University of Oxford where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in church history in 1971 with a thesis entitled \\"The exercise of authority in early Christianity from about 170 to about 270\\". During his studies at Oxford he also served as a chaplain to Catholic students at Eton College. In 1971, he returned to Australia and was assigned to serve as an assistant priest in Swan Hill, where he remained for two years. He then served at a parish in Ballarat East from 1973 to 1983, becoming administrator of the parish of Bungaree in 1984. In 1982, he earned a Master of Education degree from Monash University in Melbourne. During his tenure in Ballarat East and Bungaree, he also served as Episcopal Vicar for Education (1973–84), director of the Aquinas campus of the Institute of Catholic Education (1974–84) and principal of the Institute of Catholic Education (1981–84). He was also editor of Light, the newspaper of the Diocese of Ballarat, from 1979 to 1984. From 1985 to 1987, Pell served as seminary rector of his alma mater, Corpus Christi College. =Diocesan episcopal career= Pell was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne and titular Bishop of Roman Catholic Diocese of Scala (Italy) on 30 March 1987. He received his episcopal consecration on 21 May 1987 from Archbishop Frank Little, with bishops Ronald Mulkearns and Joseph O'Connell serving as co- consecrators. He served as Bishop for the Southern Region of Melbourne (1987–96). During this time, he was a parish priest in Mentone. Pell was named seventh Archbishop of Melbourne on 16 July 1996, receiving the pallium from Pope John Paul II on 29 June 1997. He was later appointed eighth Archbishop of Sydney on 26 March 2001 and again received the pallium from John Paul on 29 June 2001. Pell was a consultor of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace from 1990 to 1995 and a member from 2002. From 1990 to 2000 he was a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In April 2002, John Paul II named him President of the Vox Clara commission to advise the Congregation for Divine Worship on English translations of liturgical texts. On 21 December 2002 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for the Family, having previously served as a consultor to the council. On 22 September 2012, Pell was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops. As Archbishop of Melbourne, Pell maintained a high public profile on a wide range of issues, while retaining a strict adherence to Catholic orthodoxy; with some dispute over the issue of Catholics and \\"primacy of conscience\\". In 2001, he argued: \\"We must not allow the situation to deteriorate as it had in Elijah's time, 850 years before Christ, where monotheism was nearly swamped by the aggressive paganism of the followers of Baal.\\" In 2010, on reviewing the movie Avatar, he wrote: \\"Worship of the powerful forces of nature is half right, a primitive stage in the movement towards acknowledging the one: the single Transcendent God, above and beyond nature. It is a symptom of our age that Hollywood is pumping out this old-fashioned pagan propaganda.\\" Pope John Paul II announced on 28 September 2003 that he would appoint Pell and 28 others to the College of Cardinals. In the consistory of 21 October he was made cardinal priest of Santa Maria Domenica Mazzarello. With Pell as cardinal, Australia had for the first time, three cardinals eligible to participate in a papal election: Pell, Edward Bede Clancy, and Edward Idris Cassidy. Pell was one of the cardinal electors in 2005 who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI. He is reported to have served as an unauthorised \\"campaign manager\\" for Ratzinger. Pell was mentioned as a possible successor to Benedict XVI as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Pell instituted new guidelines in February 2007 for family members speaking at funerals. He said that, \\"on not a few occasions, inappropriate remarks glossing over the deceased's proclivities (drinking prowess, romantic conquests etc) or about the Church (attacking its moral teachings) have been made at funeral Masses.\\" Under Pell's guidelines, the eulogy must never replace the celebrant's homily, which should focus on the scripture readings selected, God's compassion, and the resurrection of Jesus. Pell in Rome in 2007 Pell lobbied for the successful Sydney bid to host the 2008 World Youth Day, which brought Benedict XVI on his first papal visit to Australia. The event drew approximately half a million young people from 200 countries, and one million people came to see the Pope. On 19 July 2008, Benedict issued his first public apology to victims of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests. In their 2010 Good Friday sermons, both Pell and his Anglican counterpart Archbishop Peter Jensen attacked atheism. Both men were also closely aligned on policy issues and Jensen launched Pell's biography. Pell was named by Benedict XVI on 18 September 2012 to be one of the papally appointed Synod Fathers for the October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization. Pell was the only cardinal from Oceania to take part in the 2013 papal conclave. At that conclave, he was thought to be organising votes on behalf of Cardinal Angelo Scola of Milan, the favourite candidate of the Italian cardinals. Following his election, Pope Francis named Pell, the only cardinal available to represent Oceania, one of eight members to advise the Pope on reform of the Vatican bureaucracy, called the Roman Curia; they were appointed to five-year terms. =Secretariat for the Economy= In February 2014, Pell was appointed to be the first prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy. In this role, Pell is responsible for the annual budget of the Holy See and the Vatican. In July 2014 Pell, with the consent of Pope Francis, had the Ordinary Section of Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA) transferred to the Secretariat for the Economy to enable the Secretariat to exercise economic control and vigilance over the agencies of the Holy See. It was also announced that remaining staff of APSA would begin to focus exclusively on its role as a treasury for the Holy See and the Vatican City State. Following the confirmation of the mission of the Institute for the Works of Religion's (also known as the Vatican Bank) by the Pope on 7 April 2014 the IOR announced plans for the next stage of development. The Council of Cardinal Advisers, the Secretariat for the Economy, the Supervisory Commission of Cardinals, and the current IOR Board of Superintendence agreed that this plan will be carried out by a new executive team led by Jean-Baptiste de Franssu. Pell was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on 13 September 2014. In November 2014 the Secretariat for the Economy distributed a new handbook to all Vatican offices outlining financial management policies that would go into effect on 1 January 2015. The manual was endorsed by the Council for the Economy and approved by the Pope. \\"The purpose of the manual is very simple\\", said Pell, \\"it brings Financial Management practices in line with international standards and will help all Entities and Administrations of the Holy See and the Vatican City State prepare financial reports in a consistent and transparent manner.\\" In 2015, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio questioned the scope of the authority given to the Secretariat and to Pell himself, specifically the consolidation of management and not the demand for transparency. On 12 December 2018, the Vatican announced that Pell was one of three \\"more elderly\\" cardinals who were to leave the Pope's Council of Cardinal Advisers after a five-year term. The three were also thanked by the Pope for their service. Pell's five-year term as Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy expired on 24 February 2019. =Vatican investigation of sexual abuse charges= Immediately following Pell's initial conviction for sexual abuse in February 2019, the Holy See's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) initiated its own investigation of the charges against him, but the Vatican also said the CDF would await a \\"definitive judgment\\" from the Australian courts in the case. The Pope reaffirmed at that time that Pell was \\"forbidden to exercise public ministry and ... from having contact in any way or form with minors\\", restrictions that had been in place since Pell's return to Australia in July 2017. When Pell's conviction was upheld in August 2019, the Vatican again said its review would wait for Pell to exhaust his appeals. When Pell's convictions were quashed in April 2020, a Vatican spokesperson said that ruling would contribute to the CDF's investigation which would \\"draw its conclusions on the basis of the norms of canon law\\". =Health in later life= In January 2010, Pell experienced cardiac problems during his Vatican visit, and in February had a pacemaker fitted in a Rome hospital. In 2015, Pell's doctors judged his heart condition serious enough to prevent air travel from Italy to Australia to appear before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. He was expected to be well enough to travel in February 2016. However, he was excused from giving evidence in person by commission chair Justice Peter McClellan, based on a two-page medical report submitted by Pell's lawyers. He testified from a hotel in Rome through a video link up. In December 2018, he underwent knee surgery. He recovered sufficiently to stop using a cane by June 2019. In February 2019, when he was taken into custody following his conviction, an assessment of his mental and physical health concluded he was healthy enough to be kept in HM Melbourne Assessment Prison. Views In the Australian context, Pell is regarded as progressive on many social issues but a conservative on matters of faith and morals. He has often been wary of what he calls the \\"callousness\\" of unrestrained capitalism. He has written that a Catholic is someone who is not only a person of personal conscience but \\"is someone who believes Christ is Son of God, accepts His teachings and lives a life of worship, service and duty in the community. Catholics are not created by the accident of birth to remain only because their tribe has an interesting history.\\" =Theology and worship= Ad orientem liturgy In 2009 Pell supported, in the abstract but not as a proposal for immediate application, mandatory celebration of the Canon of the Mass with the orientation of the priest ad orientem (towards the east), facing in the same direction as the congregation. \\"There's nothing like a consensus in favour of that at the moment\\", he said. \\"I think I would be in favour of it because it makes it patently clear that the priest is not the centre of the show, that this is an act of worship of the one true God, and the people are joining with the priest for that.\\" Adam and Eve During a debate against Richard Dawkins on the show Q&A; in 2012, in response to whether there had ever been a Garden of Eden scenario with an \\"actual\\" Adam and Eve, Pell said: Ordination of women and priestly celibacy In 2005 Pell supported the view that the ordination of women as priests is impossible according to the church's divine constitution and said that abandoning the tradition of clerical celibacy would be a \\"serious blunder\\". =Pope Benedict XVI= Pell said that the decision of Pope Benedict XVI to retire in 2013 could set a precedent which may be a problem for future leaders. He thought Benedict's decision to step down had destabilised the church and some of those surrounding the Pope had failed to support him in his ministry. \\"He was well aware that this is a break with tradition [and] slightly destabilising\\", Pell said. According to him, the Pope was a better theologian than he was a leader. In response to the statement that he had criticised Benedict XVI, Pell said he was stating what the Pope already mentioned himself, and his comments were \\"not breaking any ground\\". During a youth conference in Parramatta, Bishop Anthony Fisher said that Pell was merely \\"stating the pros and cons of the Pope's decision\\" and those who said his comments were critical were taking him out of context. =Political issues= Asylum seekers and refugees Pell has criticised the bipartisan policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers in Australia and called for \\"empathy and compassion\\" towards displaced peoples. Pell said that while a policy of deterrence was justifiable, the practice of the policy was coming at too great a \\"moral cost\\". Describing conditions in some of Australia's mandatory detention camps in 2001 as \\"pretty tight and miserable\\" and \\"no place for women and children\\", Pell called for investigation of any maltreatment of detainees and said that, while Australia has the right to regulate the number of refugees it accepts, as a rich and prosperous country, it can \\"afford to be generous\\" and must treat humanely those refugees who reach Australia. =Environmental positions= Pell is a climate change denier. In a 2006 speech he said that \\"hysterical and extreme claims\\" about the natural environment were the result of the \\"pagan emptiness\\" of Western culture. He said: \\"In the past pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods. Today they demand a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.\\" In a 2007 article for the Sydney Sunday Telegraph, Pell wrote that while climate had changed, he was \\"certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes, because the evidence is insufficient\\". Responding to the Anglican bishop and environmentalist George Browning, who told the Anglican Church of Australia's general synod that Pell was out of touch with the Catholic Church as well as with the general community, Pell stated: In July 2015, Pell criticised Pope Francis's encyclical Laudato si' for associating the church with the need to address climate. Pell said: Pell publicly expressed concern regarding population decline in July 2008 in a homily for the opening Mass of the World Youth Day in Sydney, in response to comments made by Pope Benedict XVI regarding climate change. While travelling to Sydney for the event, Benedict stated in a brief interview that Catholics and others must commit \\"to finding an ethical way to change our way of life and ways to respond to these great challenges\\" regarding climate change. Pell stated in his homily that mankind has a duty not \\"to damage and destroy or ruthlessly use the environment at the expense of future generations\\", but expressed scepticism regarding human activity causing climate change. Pell stated that the \\"slowing population growth and apathy towards God are the biggest challenges facing the church\\" and that Western nations faced a population crisis fuelled by \\"ruthless commercial forces\\", such that \\"No western country is producing enough babies to keep the population stable, no western country.\\"\\"Populate or perish, says Cardinal Pell\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 15 July 2008; cf. \\"Economist condemns Pell's push for more babies\\". Pell's views were contested in the Australian context by the environmental group Sustainable Population Australia, whose media release of 14 July 2008 cited Australian Bureau of Statistics figures that Australia had \\"a population growth rate of 1.6%, higher than the global average, with twice as many births as deaths...\\".Quoted in Mark O’Connor and William Lines, Overloading Australia: How governments and media dither and deny on population, (4th ed.), Sydney, Envirobook, 2010 p. 144. Pell's views were contested in a global context by the economist Jeffrey Sachs, who argued that \\"The planet, everyone can feel, is just right at the limits right now in terms of food, in terms of energy supply, in terms of land use.\\" Sachs also suggested that world population projections \\"are already too high at around an extra 2.5 billion people by 2050\\".\\"Economist condemns Pell's push for more babies\\", ABC. =Interfaith issues= Islam Pell has written of a need to \\"deepen friendship and understanding\\" with Muslims in the post–September 11 environment and has said that though there is a continuing struggle throughout the Muslim world between moderates and men of violence, he believes that, in Australia, \\"the moderates are in control\\". In 2004, speaking to the Acton Institute on the problems of \\"secular democracy\\", Pell drew a parallel between Islam and communism: \\"Islam may provide in the 21st century, the attraction that communism provided in the 20th, both for those that are alienated and embittered on the one hand and for those who seek order or justice on the other.\\" In February 2006, addressing Catholic business leaders in Naples, Florida, Pell stated: \\"Considered strictly on its own terms, Islam is not a tolerant religion and its capacity for far-reaching renovation is severely limited.\\" He doubted that Islam possesses the capacity for theological development because \\"In the Muslim understanding, the Koran comes directly from God, unmediated. The Bible, in contrast, is a product of human co- operation with divine inspiration.\\" In 2012 and 2013, Pell hosted Iftar dinners to mark the end of the Islamic celebration of Ramadan. The Grand Mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, expressed his gratitude and appreciation to Pell on behalf of Muslims for hosting the dinner. Pell said during the 2012 dinner that such gatherings are one of the fruits of tolerance that flourishes in Australian society and is a sign of respect for diversity, stating: Judaism Pell has participated in interfaith dialogues and celebrations involving Jews. In 2001, he told one such audience at Mandelbaum House that he had come from a strongly pro-Jewish family and of being saddened during his studies of history to find Christian ill-treatment of Jews. Pell spoke of the need to remember the Holocaust and of his visits to concentration camps and of his support for the right of the state of Israel to exist. He praised the role of Vatican II and of Pope John Paul II in advancing the cause of Christian- Jewish dialogue and co-operation. Pell also spoke in praise of the Jewish psalms as \\"a body of prayerful literature\\" unequalled in any other tradition and singled out the Jewish prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel as authors for whom he has a deep love and Elijah as one whom he views as highly significant. Pell called on Christian and Jewish leaders alike to speak together and respectfully listen to each other, saying of the Christian-Jewish relationship: In responding to a series of questions by Jones as to why God would \\"randomly decide to provide proof of his existence to a small group of Jews 2,000 years ago\\", Pell said that, while the intellectual life of the ancient Jews was not the equal of the surrounding great powers like Egypt, Persia and Chaldea, \\"Jesus came not as a philosopher to the elite. He came to the poor and the battlers\\". Jones cross-examined Pell over his use of the word \\"intellectual\\" and Pell said (in reference to Biblical times) that \\"the little Jewish people, they were originally shepherds. They were stuck. They're still stuck between these great powers.\\" Referring to \\"The Holocaust, to genocide, to famine\\", Jones asked why an omnipotent God would permit such events to occur. In response, Pell and Jones had the following exchange: Pell's remarks led to a clarification from his office, reported by The Times of Israel as an apology. Pell said, \\"My commitment to friendship with the Jewish community, and my esteem for the Jewish faith is a matter of public record, and the last thing I would want to do is give offence to either\\" and that the Holocaust was \\"a crime unique in history for the death and suffering it caused and its diabolical attempt to wipe out an entire people.\\" =Sexuality, marriage and bioethics= Pell has received much attention for his attitudes to sexuality issues, particularly homosexuality. When installed as Archbishop of Sydney in May 2001, he said that \\"Christian teaching on sexuality is only one part of the Ten Commandments, of the virtues and vices, but it is essential for human wellbeing and especially for the proper flourishing of marriages and families, for the continuity of the human race.\\" Divorce and remarriage Pell says that, outside exceptional circumstances such as relationships involving physical abuse, it is better for individuals and for society if couples do not divorce, particularly where children are involved. In 2001, ABC radio's The World Today reported that Pell wanted a return to a divorce system based on the fault of one spouse. Pell told the program that, in an effort to \\"focus attention on the damage, personal and financial, that unfortunately often follows from divorce\\" he had prepared a list for public consideration of possible penalties to discourage divorce (particularly where fault by one party was involved); as well as benefits to support couples who stayed together. LGBT issues In 1990, Pell stated publicly that while he recognised that homosexuality existed, such activity was nevertheless wrong and \\"for the good of society it should not be encouraged.\\" He has also expressed his belief that suicide rates among LGBT youth were a reason to discourage homosexuality, arguing that \\"Homosexual activity is a much greater health hazard than smoking.\\" In 1998, Pell refused communion to members of the Rainbow Sash Movement who had attended Mass at the cathedral in Melbourne. He publicly rebuked their actions to the applause of other parishioners. Pell opposed Australian legislation in 2006 that would have permitted LGBT couples to adopt children. In 2007, he said that discrimination against LGBT people was not comparable to that against racial minorities. HIV/AIDS In 2009, Pell supported the comments made by Pope Benedict XVI in Africa in relation to controlling the spread of AIDS, in which the Pope reiterated the Catholic teaching that the solution to the AIDS epidemic lay not in the distribution of condoms, but in the practice of sexual abstinence and monogamy within marriage. The Pope said that AIDS could not be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which \\"can even increase the problem\\". In response to global coverage of these remarks, Pell said that AIDS was a \\"great spiritual and health crisis\\" and a huge challenge, but that \\"Condoms are encouraging promiscuity. They are encouraging irresponsibility.\\" The president of the AIDS Council of New South Wales, Marc Orr, said Pell's comments were \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"contradicted all evidence\\" that condoms reduced the transmission of HIV: Mike Toole (Burnet Institute) and Rob Moodie (Nossal Institute for Global Health) wrote in The Age that Pell had said a health worker from an African country told him that \\"people in remote areas are too poor to afford condoms and the ones that are available are often of very poor quality and weren't used effectively\\". Both professors argue that \\"this is not an argument against promoting condoms – it is an argument that we need to ensure that good quality condoms are affordable for everyone and are widely distributed with information about how to use them effectively\\" and concluded \\"the sexual abstinence message is clearly not working.\\" In 2010, Benedict told an interviewer that while the church did not consider condoms as a \\"real or moral solution\\", there were times where the \\"intention of reducing the risk of infection\\" made condom use \\"a first step\\" towards a better way. Pell released a statement saying this did not signal a major new shift in Vatican thinking. Stem cell research Pell supports research on the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells but opposes embryonic stem cell research on the basis that the church cannot support anything which involves \\"the destruction of human life at any stage after conception\\". Under Pell, the Sydney archdiocese has provided funding for adult stem cell research but has actively opposed moves by the Parliament of New South Wales to liberalise laws pertaining to use of embryonic stem cells. Following a conscience vote in the Parliament of New South Wales overturning a ban on therapeutic cloning, in June 2007 Pell said that \\"Catholic politicians who vote for this legislation must realise that their voting has consequences for their place in the life of the church.\\" Some members of parliament, including ministers such as Kristina Keneally and Nathan Rees, condemned Pell's comments, calling them hypocritical; Rees drew comparisons with comments made earlier in the year by Sheik Hilali. Australian Greens MLC Lee Rhiannon referred Pell's remarks to the New South Wales parliamentary privileges committee for allegedly being in contempt of parliament. Pell described this move as a \\"clumsy attempt to curb religious freedom and freedom of speech\\". In September the committee tabled a report clearing him of this charge and recommending that no further action be taken. The legal scholar and theologian Cathleen Kaveny wrote that \\"In every possible respect, Pell's statement backfired\\" as, following backlash from elected officials and the general public, the bill passed the lower house with what she describes as \\"an overwhelming 65–26 vote\\" and passed the upper house with a 27–13 vote. Other roles The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney takes the role of visitor of St John's College, a residential college within the University of Sydney. This is a largely ceremonial role but he can also be called upon to give guidance and resolve internal disputes. Under the direction of the archbishop the college associates itself with the interests of the church and its mission, particularly by the fostering of appropriate academic directions in education, charity, social justice, ethics and the environment. Pell accepted the invitation to be patron of the Oxford University Newman Society and to deliver their inaugural St Thomas More Lecture on 6 March 2009. Pell was a contributor of articles for the Australian media, including regular columns for Sydney's The Sunday Telegraph newspaper. Handling of child sexual abuse cases by clergy while archbishop Pell's tenure as Archbishop of Melbourne began when the issue of handling of child sex abuse allegations by institutions was coming to the fore in public debate. Launching the \\"Melbourne Response\\" protocol in 1996, Pell said: \\"It's a matter of regret that the Catholic Church has taken some time to come to grips with the sex abuse issue adequately.\\" In his final sermon as Archbishop of Sydney in 2014 before departing Australia for Rome, Pell told the congregation: \\"I apologise once again to the victims and their families for the terrible suffering that has been brought to bear by these crimes\\". He said procedural improvements could still be made to the church's efforts against child sexual abuse, and then he added that he \\"looked forward\\" to the findings of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse which he said was providing a \\"public service\\" in allowing victims to air their experiences. His choice of words drew wide criticism as they were perceived as being inappropriately blithe and unempathetic to the victims of abuse. =\\"Melbourne Response\\" protocol for abuse cases= Shortly after becoming Archbishop of Melbourne in August 1996, Pell discussed the issue of child abuse with the Victorian premier, governor and retired judge Richard McGarvie, who all recommended swift action. He engaged the law firm Corrs to draft a scheme which would be funded by but operate independently of the Archdiocese of Melbourne. A public forum was held on 19 October and the resulting \\"Melbourne Response\\" was announced on 30 October 1996. Victims were publicly encouraged to come forward. Pell's Melbourne-specific policy preceded the national church response, known as \\"Towards Healing\\", which the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference approved in November and took effect in March 1997. When Pell was appointed a cardinal in 2003, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation said that he had established Australia's first independent commissioner to handle child sexual abuse complaints against clergy. The Melbourne Response was the subject of Case Study 16 in the 2013–2017 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and was also examined in the 2013 Victorian government Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations. Pell was called to testify at both inquiries. In 2017, the royal commission reported that the Melbourne Response was \\"widely criticised as being legalistic and offering inadequate support to victims\\". According to the royal commission, the Melbourne Response set its goals as \\"truth, humility, healing for the victims, assistance to other persons affected, an adequate response to those accused and to offenders and the prevention of any such offences in the future\\". Its key features were the appointment of independent commissioners to inquire into allegations and make recommendations; a counselling and support service (Carelink); and the establishment of a compensation panel to advise on making \\"ex-gratia\\" payments to victims of child sexual abuse. The ex gratia payments are made without the church recognising any liability to victims and were initially capped at $50,000. It was increased to $55,000 in 2000 and to $75,000 in 2008. Peter O'Callaghan was appointed the first independent commissioner. He went on to investigate 351 complaints of child sexual abuse, and upheld 97% of those. =2013 Victorian parliamentary inquiry= On 27 May 2013, Pell gave evidence before Victoria's Parliamentary Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations. Pell told the inquiry that he was \\"fully apologetic and absolutely sorry\\". The parliamentarians questioned Pell over allegations from the parents of a victim that he had not shown them empathy. Pell said he had in fact fully understood the suffering. He agreed with the inquiry that his predecessor had \\"covered up\\" matters for fear of scandal. Pell was heckled from the gallery. Pell critic David Marr wrote that \\"He [Pell] admitted his church had covered up child sexual abuse for fear of scandal; that his predecessor Archbishop Little had destroyed records, moved paedophile priests from parish to parish and facilitated appalling crimes.\\" During the course of the inquiry, a victim of a paedophile Christian Brother at St Alipius Primary School said that in 1969 Pell heard him pleading for help a few weeks after he had been raped. Pell denied the statement, which was later discredited when Pell produced his passport to confirm that he was not living in Australia that year. =Response to historic allegations in Sydney= During Pell's time as Archbishop of Sydney, allegations of child sexual abuse were made against around 55 priests in the archdiocese. These were largely related to incidents that occurred prior to his arrival as archbishop. The allegations resulted in just under $8 million in reparation payments. =Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse= In late 2012, the Australian federal government established a Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Pell welcomed the inquiry and said \\"We think this is an opportunity to help the victims, it's an opportunity to clear the air and separate fact from fiction.\\" He said there had been a persistent \\"press campaign against the Catholic Church\\". The commission conducted hearings between 2013 and 2017. Pell gave evidence on three occasions to the royal commission, beginning in March 2014 in Sydney and via video link from the Vatican in August 2014 and in February/March 2016. In his 2012 Christmas address Pell said he felt \\"shock and shame\\" at revelations of crime and wrongdoing that were completely contrary to Christ's teaching. Pell called the crimes and wrongdoings \\"disasters\\". He said he was \\"deeply sorry this has happened\\" and told his listeners to \\"help those who have been hurt\\". Comments upholding the Seal of Confession The announcement of the royal commission was accompanied by calls from some quarters for relaxing the requirement of confidentiality in confessions, which has been upheld by the Catholic Church since the fifth century. It is protected under Australian law in such statutes as the Evidence Act 1995 (which also provides protections for lawyers, journalists and spouses).Evidence Act 1995; Commonwealth Consolidated Acts When Pell was asked whether he thought that a priest who hears the confession of someone who has committed child sex abuse must remain bound by the Seal of Confession, he replied: The ABC reported that the comment \\"met with disapproval\\", citing Catholic politician Barry O'Farrell, who told Parliament that confessions should not be secret. Accusations of misconduct A number of criticisms of Pell's conduct and manner towards victims and perpetrators have been aired in the Australian media and considered at the royal commission. His appearances before the royal commission were met with intense public interest in Australia. He was heckled from the public galleries. Pell has complained of unfair treatment from the media and \\"relentless character assassination\\". An SBS article by Debi Marshall included suggestions Pell had ignored accounts of physical and child sexual abuse and covered up such abuse. Marshall raised the allegation that Pell had attempted to \\"bribe\\" a victim. However, Pell was cross-examined by Counsel Assisting Gail Furness over the widely publicised statement that in 1993, he attempted to bribe David Ridsdale into silence, when David Ridsdale called him about the historical misconduct of his child-molesting priest uncle Gerald Ridsdale. In her final submission, Furness conceded that the allegation was unlikely to be an accurate interpretation of Pell's intent, as it was already known that Gerald Ridsdale was under investigation by police, and David Ridsdale was requesting a private process and not suggesting he wanted to go to police. The royal commission also considered evidence of Pell's \\"knowledge of rumours, allegations or complaints of Dowlan's sexual abuse of children in Ballarat\\", also raised in Marshall's article. One witness said he had gone to \\"Pell's presbytery\\" in Ballarat to warn him about Dowlan. Pell submitted evidence that he did not live in Ballarat or in that presbytery at the time, and the counsel-assisting said in her final submission that \\"Cardinal Pell's evidence about his living arrangements and duties in 1973 and 1974 make it less likely that he was at St Patrick's presbytery late in the afternoon on a week day.\\" March 2014 appearance In 2014, the royal commission was told how lawyers representing Pell and the Archdiocese of Sydney incurred costs of A$1.5 million against a victim of child sexual abuse. The lawyers, acting on the church's instructions, \\"vigorously\\" fought John Ellis through the courts despite warnings of his \\"fragile psychological state\\". The resulting New South Wales Court of Appeal ruling established the controversial \\"Ellis Defence\\", which confirmed that the church could not be sued as a legal entity and held liable for child sexual abuse committed by a priest in such matters. Eventually, Ellis received $568,000 from the church. In a statement to the royal commission in March 2014, Pell reversed his earlier stance in support of the defence, saying: \\"My own view is that the Church in Australia should be able to be sued in cases of this kind.\\" In his 2014 appearance, Pell used an analogy of a trucking company: \\"If the truck driver picks up some lady and then molests her, I don't think it's appropriate, because it is contrary to the policy, for the ownership, the leadership of that company to be held responsible.\\" He was widely criticised for this remark. The president of Adults Surviving Child Abuse, Cathy Kezelman, called his comments \\"outrageous\\", saying that they denied the experience of victims. Nicky Davis, from the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), said that Pell had made a \\"highly offensive\\" comparison. Michael Bradley, writing in his weekly column for ABC News, said \\"Yes, it was mind-blowingly insensitive to draw that analogy and to so blithely refer to 'some lady'. But there was a much bigger hole. In the world according to Pell, if the Catholic Church has a policy that tells its priests not to rape children then, if they still do so, the Church cannot be held accountable.\\" 2016 appearance Pell appeared before the royal commission in February and March 2016 by video link from a hotel in Rome because his heart condition made travel to Australia inadvisable. After the announcement that Pell would testify from Rome in 2016, a GoFundMe campaign was launched to fund a trip to Rome by 15 victims of child sexual abuse to see Pell give evidence in person. It reached its target of A$55,000 in one day, doubled that the following day and trebled the day after. The musician Tim Minchin released the song \\"Come Home (Cardinal Pell)\\", with all proceeds to go to the GoFundMe campaign. The song described Pell as \\"scum\\" and a \\"coward\\". Within 24 hours it had over 400,000 views on YouTube and became the number one position on the iTunes song chart in Australia. In the event, Pell's testimony was witnessed by 15 victims of child sexual abuse and their supporters. Having sworn on the Bible, Pell stated that he did not think the problems with child sexual abuse were with the institutional structure of the Catholic Church. \\"The Church has made enormous mistakes and is working to remedy those\\", he said. \\"The Church in many places, certainly in Australia, has mucked things up, has let people down. I'm not here to defend the indefensible.\\" Counsel assisting the royal commission alleged that there were also wider problems with the church's hierarchy in Australia and Rome and beyond, which they thought he understated or sidestepped. Regarding the allegations of children, he said that \\"the predisposition was not to believe\\" and that the instinct was to protect the church. He said: \\"Too many of them certainly were dismissed and sometimes they were dismissed in absolutely scandalous circumstances ... They were very, very, very plausible allegations made by responsible people that were not followed up sufficiently.\\" Pell also stated that the way Gerald Ridsdale was dealt with was \\"a catastrophe for the victims and a catastrophe for the church\\". Referring to rumours of child sexual abuse he added: \\"in those days\\", he said, \\"if a priest denied such activity, I was very strongly inclined to accept the denial\\". In June 2016 the Holy See Press Office director Federico Lombardi announced that Pell would continue in his role as prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, despite being obliged to submit his resignation on turning 75. Lombardi reminded reporters that Pope Francis had previously expressed his full confidence in Pell, and that Francis wished him to continue as prefect. Gerald Ridsdale Pell served as an assistant priest at St Alipius' Church in Ballarat East and, in 1973, shared a house with Gerald Ridsdale, a priest who was later laicised and jailed for child sex crimes. Ridsdale was convicted between 1993 and 2017 of a very large number of child sexual abuse and indecent assault charges against children aged as young as four years during the 1970s and 1980s, the total number of known victims standing at 79, but that is thought to be a small proportion of his victims. Pell was part of a leadership group of priests in the Diocese of Ballarat who met during 1982 and discussed moving Ridsdale from the parish at and sending him to Sydney. Pell denied knowing about any of Ridsdale's actions. Journalist and former priest Paul Bongiorno, who also lived in a presbytery with Ridsdale, told ABC radio that Ridsdale concealed his activities: \\"They hide it. It was certainly hidden from me. And when it came out, after I'd left the priesthood, I was shocked and I was ashamed.\\" In March 2016, when asked by the royal commission why he had agreed to walk Ridsdale into the courthouse in Melbourne during his 1993 criminal trial, Pell responded, \\"I had some status as an auxiliary bishop and I was asked to appear with the ambition that this would lessen the term of punishment, lessen his time in jail.\\" Peter Saunders, the victims' advocate and a former Catholic priest, said that this Pell response \\"demonstrates once again the callousness, the coldheartedness and the contempt that George Pell appears to display for this whole issue and particularly for the victims of these dreadful crimes.\\" In 2002 on 60 Minutes, Pell was accused by David Ridsdale, a victim of child sex abuse in and the nephew of Gerald Ridsdale, of attempting to bribe him in 1993 in order to prevent child sexual abuse being made public. The allegation was examined at the royal commission and received further wide publicity. However, Counsel- Assisting Gail Furness conceded in her final submission to the royal commission that, given it was already known to Pell that Gerald Ridsdale was subject to police investigation and that David Ridsdale had requested a \\"private\\" rather than police process, \\"it is not likely that Bishop Pell would then have thought it necessary to offer Mr Ridsdale an inducement to prevent him from going to the police or public with his allegations\\", and Ridsdale could have \\"misinterpreted Bishop Pell's offer of assistance\\". Commission conclusions On 7 May 2020, the royal commission revealed its findings regarding Pell, which had been made by 2017 but were withheld while Pell's own sexual abuse case was ongoing. concluding that Pell knew of child sexual abuse by clergy by the 1970s, but did not take adequate action to address it. Pell responded that the commission's views \\"are not supported by evidence\\". For the case of Gerald Ridsdale, while Pell was a priest in Ballarat, the commission concluded that \\"in 1973 Father Pell turned his mind to the prudence of Ridsdale taking boys on overnight camps\\", with child sexual abuse \\"on his radar, in relation to\\" Ridsdale. The commission concluded that \\"by 1973, Cardinal Pell was not only conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy, but he also considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it\\". For the case of Father Peter Searson, while Pell was an auxiliary bishop in Melbourne, the commission concluded that given the information Pell had in 1989, he \\"should have advised the Archbishop to remove Father Searson and he did not do so\\". Pell had told the commission that, in 1989, he received a list of grievances about Searson. The list included statements that Searson had harassed children, parents and school staff, used children's toilets without cause, shown children a dead body and practised animal cruelty. The commission concluded that it \\"ought to have been obvious\\" to Pell that he needed to have Season removed, while rejecting Pell's statement that he had been \\"deceived\\" regarding Searson's case by education officials. Pell removed Searson in 1997 when he had become the archbishop. For the case of Father Wilfred James Baker, while Pell was the Archbishop of Melbourne, the commission concluded that Pell had the power to remove Baker in August 1996 when he learned that Baker was about to be charged. Pell did not remove Baker then, resulting in Baker continuing as a priest in a parish with a primary school until May 1997. Baker was jailed in 1999 for child sexual abuse. Allegations of child sexual abuse =2002 allegation = In June 2002, a Melbourne man accused Pell of sexually abusing him at a Catholic youth camp in 1961, when the accuser was 12 years old and Pell was a young seminarian. Pell denied the accusations and stood aside while the inquiry continued. The complainant agreed to pursue his allegations through the church's own process for dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct, the National Committee for Professional Standards. Retired Victorian Supreme Court Justice Alec Southwell, appointed commissioner by the church to investigate the matter, found that the complainant, despite his long criminal record, had mostly given the impression of \\"speaking honestly from actual recollection\\" but concluded as follows: \\"bearing in mind the forensic difficulties of the defence occasioned by the very long delay, some valid criticism of the complainant's credibility, the lack of corroborative evidence and the sworn denial of the respondent, I find I am not 'satisfied that the complaint has been established. Pell said he had been exonerated, while the complainant's solicitor said his client had been vindicated. =Victoria Police investigations= In March 2013, Victoria Police launched \\"Operation Tethering\\" to investigate whether Pell had committed unreported crimes. On 20 February 2016, the Herald Sun newspaper reported that Pell had been under investigation for the past year by detectives from the Victoria Police SANO Taskforce over sexual abuse allegations involving between five and ten boys that occurred between 1978 and 2001 when he was a priest in Ballarat and when he was archbishop of Melbourne. His office issued a public statement denying the allegations calling them \\"utterly false\\" and asked for an inquiry into the leaking of information by Victoria Police officers to the media. Victoria Police remained silent on whether Pell was being investigated. The SANO Taskforce was established in 2012 to investigate allegations arising from the Victorian Government Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations and the subsequent Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. On 28 July 2016, the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Graham Ashton, confirmed that there was an investigation into alleged child sexual abuse by Pell following a report by the ABC's 7.30 program the previous day and stated that he was awaiting advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). On 17 August 2016, Victoria Police said a response had been received from the DPP, but would not disclose the DPP's recommendations. In October 2016, three Victoria Police officers from the SANO Task Force flew to Rome to interview Pell, who voluntarily participated, regarding allegations of sexual assault. In February 2017, Victoria Police advised that the brief of evidence against Pell for sexual assault allegations had been returned to the Office of Public Prosecutions for review with advice subsequently provided to Victoria Police in May 2017. =Charges, trial and conviction=  Initial charges and hearings  On 29 June 2017, Victoria Police announced they were charging Pell with a series of sexual assault offences with several counts and several victims. At a press conference in Rome, Pell stated that he would return to Australia and was \\"looking forward, finally, to having my day in court\\" and said \\"I'm innocent of those charges. They are false\\". On 10 July 2017, Pell left the Vatican and returned to Australia to face trial. Details of the charges were not made public, however a series of hearings and two trials later dismissed all but one of the cases brought against Pell. On 26 July 2017, whilst not required to attend in person, Pell appeared at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court for a filing hearing represented by barrister Robert Richter; and, although not required at this stage of the court committal process, he entered a plea of not guilty. An application by the media seeking the public disclosure of the details of the charges was refused by the magistrate. At a procedural hearing on 22 November 2017, his lawyers requested documents from ABC News journalist Louise Milligan and Melbourne University Press relating to Milligan's book Cardinal: the Rise and Fall of George Pell which was published in early 2017. In January 2018, accuser Damian Dignan died after a long illness. Former chief Victorian magistrate Nicholas Papas said that Dignan's death would affect the structure of Pell's court case (the \\"swimmers trial\\"), and stated that in a case of historical child sexual abuse it can \\"seriously affect the case\\" due to a lack of witnesses. That charge was withdrawn on the Friday before the committal hearing was due to begin. Pell's lawyers requested and were denied the personal medical information of the complainants. Pell's defence was reported to be based on questioning the timing of allegations. Some other charges were dropped after a complainant was ruled medically unfit to give evidence. The committal hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to commit Pell to stand trial commenced on 5 March 2018. The hearing allowed for approximately fifty witnesses to give evidence, including former choirboys. The magistrate allowed Pell's barrister to cross-examine all but five witnesses. As a result, the hearing was scheduled to allow for four weeks of testimony and cross-examination. Pell's barrister said the matter would go to trial and that some of the allegations, those involving St Patrick's Cathedral, were impossible. On 1 May 2018, Pell was committed to stand trial on several historical sexual offence charges. Magistrate Belinda Wallington concluded that there was enough evidence for the case to proceed on about half of the charges. Allegations that Pell committed sexual assault in the 1970s in a Ballarat cinema and chapel were among the charges dismissed.Cardinal George Pell pleads not guilty to historical sexual offence charges after being committed to stand trial; www.abc.net.au She permitted remaining unrelated allegations to proceed to trial: the \\"swimmers trial\\" and the \\"cathedral trial\\". Pell entered pleas of not guilty. As a bail condition, Pell surrendered his Vatican passport and was not permitted to leave Australia. On 2 May 2018, Pell appeared in the County Court of Victoria for a directions hearing before Judge Sue Pullen, and it was agreed that he would undergo two separate trials with two separate juries and that the charges would be heard separately for each trial. He was to be tried in relation to allegations of sexual offences taking place at St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, in 1990 in the first case (the \\"cathedral trial\\"), and in relation to further allegations taking place at a Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s in the second case (the \\"swimmers trial\\"). The Catholic Weekly, a publication of the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney, advertised seeking donations for Pell's legal fund and wrote an article promoting the appeal for funding. It is unknown who was responsible for the advertising or the donation drive. Prosecutors sought a media ban on reporting on the trials until the verdict in the second trial. A suppression order was subsequently issued by Chief Judge Peter Kidd on 25 June 2018.Suppression order: * * The purpose of the order was to prevent the risk of prejudice to Pell by jurors in the \\"swimmers trial\\" knowing the details or the outcome of the \\"cathedral trial\\" so that he received a fair trial. \\"Cathedral trial\\" Pell's first trial for the allegations of misconduct in St Patrick's Cathedral began in August 2018 under Chief Judge Kidd. However, it ended with the jury unable to reach a unanimous verdict. This necessitated a retrial, with another jury.Inside the Pell trial: we sat in court for months, forbidden from reporting a word; www.theguardian.co; 27 February 2019 A retrial was conducted, again under Chief Judge Kidd. On 11 December 2018, Pell was convicted on five counts of child sexual abuse of two boys in the 1990s. Australian media outlets generally respected the suppression order preventing publication of details on the \\"cathedral trial\\" until the verdict in the \\"swimmers trial\\" whereas international news sources decided to report the conviction. The Melbourne-based Herald Sun posted on its front page \\"CENSORED\\" in large print in protest of the ban, noting that international sources were reporting on a \\"very important story that is relevant to Victorians\\". In a statement made to The Washington Post, Noah Shachtman, editor-in-chief of the online news magazine The Daily Beast, consulted with American and Australian lawyers, but ultimately considered it an \\"easy call\\" to report on the conviction, though he did place geo-blocking restrictions to prevent online access to the story from Australia. More than 140 international news reports were published within 24 hours with Pell's barrister informing Chief Judge Judd it was on wikipedia. \\"Swimmers trial\\": prosecution withdraws its case At the time of Pell's conviction in the \\"cathedral trial\\", a second trial was pending regarding unrelated allegations that he sexually assaulted two boys while throwing them in the air in a Ballarat swimming pool in the late 1970s. These allegations had been raised by the ABC, leading to a Victoria Police investigation; however, Victoria's Director of Public Prosecutions dropped the charges after Chief Judge Kidd on 22 February 2019 disallowed the prosecution's submission of evidence from complainants on the grounds that each piece of evidence was not sufficient.George Pell swimming pool sexual assault charges dropped; The Australian' 26 February 2019 News of Pell's conviction was published in Australia on 26 February 2019 when the suppression order was lifted following the withdrawal. An alleged victim intends to launch a claim for damages against Pell and other parties. \\"Cathedral trial\\" sentencing At a pre- sentencing hearing on 27 February 2019, Pell's bail was revoked and he was taken into custody at the Melbourne Assessment Prison. Pell's lawyers advised that an appeal had been filed against his conviction on three grounds. His lawyers released a statement that he \\"has always maintained his innocence and continues to do so\\". The sentencing hearing on 13 March 2019 was broadcast live to the public, with Chief Judge Kidd sentencing Pell to serve six years in jail with a non-parole period of three years and eight months. Pell was also registered as a sex offender. In his preliminary remarks during sentencing, Kidd mentioned examples of a \\"witch-hunt\\" or \\"lynch mob\\" mentality in relation to Pell during the lead-up to his conviction. Describing the nature of the conviction, Kidd said \\"the offending which the jury has found you have engaged in, was on any view, breathtakingly arrogant. These are all reasonable inferences available once it is assumed, as I must, that this offending actually occurred.\\" After an assessment of the impact on victims, including the gravity of the offences, the age of the defendant (including his health) and Pell's \\"otherwise good character\\" and \\"blameless life\\", Kidd sentenced him to a total effective sentence of six years' imprisonment.\\"George Pell's full sentencing, as issued by Chief Judge Peter Kidd\\", ABC News, 13 March 2019. Divided opinion and public reception Pell's trial and conviction divided public opinion in Australia. The Jesuit human rights lawyer Father Frank Brennan, a long-time theological critic of Pell, wrote following his conviction: \\"I was very surprised by the verdict. In fact, I was devastated ... The jurors must have judged the complainant to be honest and reliable even though many of the details he gave were improbable if not impossible.\\" The Catholic high school Pell attended in Ballarat removed his name from one of its buildings. Following Pell's conviction, The Australians Paul Kelly wrote that \\"calculated media assaults on Pell\\" had been \\"spearheaded by the ABC\\", contributing to an intense and unjustified public hatred of him and prejudicial environment in which to conduct a trial. The Ages crime reporter John Silvester outlined his concerns at the conviction: \\"George Pell is a polarising figure, which is perhaps why there are now two warring camps – those who want him to be guilty of historical sex offences against two choirboys and those who don't ... [He] was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt on the uncorroborated evidence of one witness, without forensic evidence, a pattern of behaviour or a confession ... If Pell did molest those two teenagers in the busy cathedral, it certainly does not fit the usual pattern of priests ... although he had access to hundreds of boys over his career he did not groom the vulnerable. Instead he attacked two he did not know in broad daylight in a near public area.\\" Breach of suppression order by media On 26 March 2019, Victoria's Director of Public Prosecutions named 36 media outlets, journalists and broadcasters in the Supreme Court and applied that they be found guilty, convicted and either imprisoned or fined for breaching the suppression order. International media did not face charges. =Appeal= The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria heard pleadings for Pell being granted leave to appeal simultaneously with the appeal itself on 5–6 June 2019. Pell was represented by Bret Walker SC. Three grounds of appeal were lodged: that the verdict was unreasonable, that permission to use in their closing address a visual aid prepared by the defence that illustrated the locations of people within the cathedral around the time of the first assault had been refused, and that Pell had not been arraigned in the presence of the jury as is required under standard criminal procedures in Victoria. Judgment was reserved, without setting a date to deliver the decision. Pell remained in prison until then. On 10 August 2019, a Victorian Department of Justice spokeswoman said that Pell could face disciplinary action after a letter he apparently wrote from prison was posted on a Twitter account called \\"Cardinal George Pell Supporters\\"; the Victorian government bans prisoners from using social media or asking others to post on their behalf. On 21 August 2019, the Court of Appeal issued its ruling, which upheld the conviction.VCA dismissal:  * * The three-judge panel comprised Chief Justice Anne Ferguson, President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Chris Maxwell and Justice Mark Weinberg. On the first ground of appeal, that the verdict was unreasonable, the court granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal by a majority (2–1) decision. Chief Justice Ferguson and President Maxwell dismissed the appeal. Ferguson stated that, for the appeal to succeed, the court needed to find that the jury must have had doubt as to the defendant's guilt, not merely that they could have had doubt. Justice Weinberg issued a dissenting judgment and would have allowed the appeal on the first ground. Whilst Chief Justice Ferguson and President Maxwell stated that they \\"did not experience a doubt\\" in the case, the dissenting Judge Weinberg likened the case to that of Lindy Chamberlain, which had seen wrongful conviction by a jury and appeal court based on faulty evidence:\\"Dissenting judge used Lindy Chamberlain's case to dismiss guilty Pell verdict\\", www.msn.com, 22 August 2019.\\"George Pell v The Queen\\", Victorian Court of Appeal. Weinberg wrote that \\"there is, to my mind, a 'significant possibility' that the applicant in this case may not have committed these offences. That means that, in my respectful opinion, these convictions cannot be permitted to stand. The only order that can properly be made is that the applicant be acquitted on each charge.\\"\\"He was a witness of truth: why the judges decided Cardinal George Pell was guilty\\", The Guardian, 21 August 2019.\\"Pell v The Queen [2019]\\", VSCA 186, 21 August 2019. The court unanimously refused leave to appeal on the second and third grounds. In relation to the second ground, Chief Justice Ferguson described the visual aid that Pell's lawyer sought to present in his closing address as tendentious, as potentially misleading or confusing and as including material that was unsupported by evidence in the trial record. The court ruled that the trial judge had been correct to exclude it. In relation to the third ground, the court ruled that the requirement for the jury to be present during arraignment did not require physical presence and that presence via video link (as was the case here) was adequate to satisfy this requirement. Reaction to appeal SBS reported that people outside of Victoria's Supreme Court cheered and \\"abuse survivors and victims' advocates say justice has been done\\" while \\"one supporter of Pell was shouted down\\". The ABC's Louise Milligan congratulated the majority judges, and wrote for the ABC \\"As the only journalist who has met J [Pell's accuser] and other complainants against George Pell, and who wrote about these allegations in my book, Cardinal, The Rise and Fall of George Pell... I have never had any reason to believe that J is not telling the truth ... It's the ultimate David and Goliath tale of a young man who never sought fame, just wanted justice, against a well-resourced defendant who has for years cultivated and been supported by the powerful.\\" Former race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane dismissed concerns at Pell's conviction as an affront to the \\"rule of law\\" and a case of \\"conservatives\\" creating a \\"twisted inversion of victimhood\\". = Acquittal = On 17 September 2019, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia, the final court of appeal in Australia.There is no automatic right to appeal to the High Court; special leave is always required. On 13 November, two justices of the High Court referred the decision on leave to appeal to a full court \\"for argument as on an appeal\\". On 19 November 2019, most of the High Court appeal timeline was set. Pell's lawyers submitted in January 2020 that Pell's conviction should be overturned, on the basis that, in the face of exculpatory evidence, the Court of Appeal had relied on their \\"belief\\" in the complainant to eliminate doubt and uphold the conviction. The prosecution submission filed on 1 February asserted that the appeal judgement had glossed over evidence that supported his conviction. The application for leave to appeal was heard on 11 and 12 March 2020 by a full bench of seven justices. On 7 April 2020, the High Court unanimously granted leave to appeal, treated the arguments about leave as arguments on an appeal, and allowed the appeal, quashing Pell's convictions and determining that judgments of acquittal be entered in their place. The court found (as stated in its summary) that the jury, \\"acting rationally on the whole of the evidence, ought to have entertained a doubt as to the applicant's guilt with respect to each of the offences for which he was convicted\\". The court agreed with the minority judgment in the Court of Appeal, finding that the majority might have effectively reversed the burden of proof; the majority had been so impressed with the accuser's evidence that it had gone on to ask only whether, despite the testimonies of the \\"opportunity witnesses\\", there was a \\"possibility\\" that the alleged assaults had taken place and not, as was required by the test of reasonable doubt, whether there was a reasonable \\"possibility\\" that they had not. In their judgment, the judges said with respect to all five charges that, \\"Making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility ... that an innocent person has been convicted.\\" The Vatican welcomed the acquittal and soon after Pope Francis made mention during a Mass of the \\"persecution that Jesus suffered\\" and added \\"I would like to pray today for all those people who suffer unjust sentences resulting from intransigence [against them].\\" The accuser, still anonymised as \\"Witness J\\", issued a statement that he respected the decision and hoped that it would not discourage other victims of sexual abuse from lodging complaints, adding \\"This case does not define me. I am a man who came forward for my friend who, sadly, is no longer with us.\\" Pell wrote in The Australian: \\"I knew God was with me, but I didn't know what He was up to, although I realised He has left all of us free\\", adding \\"But with every blow it was a consolation to know I could offer it to God for some good purpose like turning the mass of suffering into spiritual energy.\\" = Reactions after acquittal =  Criticism of ABC coverage  Following Pell's acquittal, prior media coverage of his case came under intense scrutiny. Australia's national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), was accused of sustained bias against Pell both before and during the trial and appeals. Pell said the ABC had betrayed the national interest in overwhelmingly presenting a single view of the case, and that he was a target because of his socially conservative views. Paul Kelly of The Australian newspaper wrote that the ABC had waged a relentless campaign for years against Pell, fuelling a mob mentality and failing to inform the public about the issues involved. Gerard Henderson of the Sydney Institute wrote that no other defendant in modern Australia has been subjected to such a media pile-on, and that the ABC had led the campaign. Catholic Priest Robert McCulloch said there had been an intellectual pursuit to bring down Pell and his church. The ABC dismissed criticisms of its coverage and defended its pursuit of Pell as having been \\"without fear or favour\\". After criticism that its documentary series Revelation (which presented Pell as guilty) had been timed to coincide with the High Court decision, the ABC denied \\"rushing forward\\" the program, but removed it from its digital platform for \\"re-editing\\". Despite criticism from many conservative commentators, Revelation had actually been pushed back several days due to Prime Minister Scott Morrison making a televised address to the nation regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.https://about.abc.net.au/media-room/revelation-episodes-2-3-to-air- next-week/ https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2020/03/25/2020-3-25-schedule- update-revelation-to-air-over-two-nights-next-week-on-abc-2/ In the aftermath of the acquittal, ABC presenters and reporters including Louise Milligan expressed disappointment on social media. Former radio presenter Jon Faine expressed dismay at the High Court decision.\\"Pell acquittal puts Victorian courts on trial, and shows they need a reality check\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 7 April 2020.  Criticism of Victorian criminal justice system  Criticism of the conduct of Victoria Police, the DPP and the Court of Appeal judges resulted from the High Court verdict. Paul Kelly wrote that Pell had been treated in an irrational way, police had failed to properly test witness evidence before laying charges, and the trial had been politicised. Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan equated the trial to a left-wing version of the broken criminal justice system in Queensland during the 1970s, and said even Aborigines had not been treated as prejudicially by the worst of 19th-century judges.Travesty of justice: ‘trusted’ institutions fail Pell, public; The Australian; 11 April 2020 =April 2020 media reports= On 14 April 2020, it was reported that Pell was under a secret investigation by Victorian police regarding a separate allegation of child sexual abuse committed in Ballarat in the 1970s. Writings Pell has written widely in religious and secular magazines, including learned journals and newspapers in Australia and overseas. He regularly spoke on television and radio. His other publications include The Sisters of St Joseph in Swan Hill 1922–72 (1972), Catholicism in Australia (1988), Rerum Novarum – One Hundred Years Later (1992), Catholicism and the Architecture of Freedom.  * For senior secondary classes and parish groups. * * A collection of homilies and reflections. * * Distinctions =Orders= * : 60px Grand Prior of the New South Wales Lieutenancy of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (2001), Grand Prior of the Australian Lieutenancy – Southern of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (1998–2001) * : 60px Companion of the Order of Australia (2005) for service to the Catholic Church in Australia and internationally, to raising debate on matters of an ethical and spiritual nature, to education and social justice. =Awards= * : 60px Centenary Medal (2001) for service to Australian society through the Catholic Church. =Other= * 60px Ecclesiastical Grand Cross and Ecclesiastical Grand Cross of Merit of the Malta-Paris obedience of the Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910) (2003) for longstanding commitment to ecumenism, and service as National Chaplain (2001).

He studied in Aristotle’s Lyceum under Theophrastus, and eventually became a follower of Crates of Thebes who married Metrocles’ sister Hipparchia. Very little survives of his writings, but he is important as one of the first Cynics to adopt the practice of writing moral anecdotes (chreiai) about Diogenes and other Cynics. Life The supposed story of Metrocles' conversion to Cynicism is reported by Diogenes Laërtius.Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 94 Metrocles had apparently farted while practicing a speech, and became so upset that he shut himself up in his home, attempting to commit suicide by starving himself. Crates visited him and made him a dinner of lupines,Lupin beans were notorious for causing flatulence. explaining to him that what he had done was according to nature and therefore nothing to be ashamed of. When Crates himself farted to demonstrate how natural it was, Metrocles was persuaded to let go of his shame. Whether or not this story is true, the symbolism for the Cynics is that it demonstrated the worthlessness of Metrocles' education up until that time. As a pupil of Theophrastus he may have learned a lot of information, but he was still obsessed with social conventions and good manners, to the point of being ready to die from embarrassment. With Crates' help he was able to let go of his old ways and embrace a Cynic life free from convention, and find true happiness. Equally significant is a passage preserved in the writings of Teles, who tells how Metrocles as a young student of the Lyceum and the Academy could not keep up with the extravagant life-style requirements: > When he was studying with Theophrastus and Xenocrates, although many things > were being sent to him from home, he was in constant fear of dying from > hunger and was always destitute and in want. But when he later changed over > to Crates, he could feed even another person though nothing was sent from > home. For in the former case he had to have shoes,... then a cloak, a > following of slaves, and a grand house; for the common table he had to see > that the breads were pure, the delicacies above the ordinary, the wine > sweet, the entertainment appropriate, so that here there was much expense. > For among them such a way of life was judged to be 'liberal.'Teles, Fragment > 4a, quoted in David A. Holgate (1999), Prodigality, Liberality and Meanness > in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, page 151. Continuum International. and > in J. Bryant, (1996), Moral Codes and Social Structure in Ancient Greece, > page 525. SUNY Press. According to Hecato of Rhodes, Metrocles burned all his writings, but others said it was only the notes he took in the school of Theophrastus that he burned.Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 95 It may have been via Metrocles that his sister Hipparchia met Crates, whom she later married, thus also becoming a Cynic. Plutarch represents Metrocles as sleeping in the winter amongst sheep, and in the summer in the porches of temples.Plutarch, Moralia He apparently knew the Megarian philosopher Stilpo and disputed with him,Plutarch, De Tranquilliate Animi, vi. 468 and Stilpo wrote a dialogue called Metrocles.Diogenes Laertius, ii. 120 In his biography of Metrocles, Diogenes Laërtius seemingly lists a number of his pupils, but the list probably refers to Crates.R. Bracht Branham, Marie-Odile Goulet-Cazé, (2000), The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy, page 398. Cf. page 392 pointing out that Diogenes Laertius vi. 98 also returns to the biography of Crates. Metrocles died at a great age, and is said to have deliberately suffocated himself. Writings Metrocles was a man of great ability, and wrote several works, but little of his thought survives. He objected to wealth unless it was put to good use; and he divided things into those that can be bought with money (such as a house), and those that take time and care, like education. One of his works was called Chreiai (), that is, Anecdotes, or Maxims. Thus he became one of the first to contribute to the most important literary art-form for the Cynics: thousands of anecdotes were accumulated (and invented) concerning Diogenes, Crates and other Cynics, all of them providing moral messages through the actions of the Cynics. An anecdote written by Metrocles concerning Diogenes is preserved by Laërtius: > On one occasion Diogenes went with his head half-shaved into an > entertainment of young men, as Metrocles tells us in his Chreiai, and so was > beaten by them. And afterwards he wrote the names of all those who had > beaten him, on a white tablet, and went about with the tablet round his > neck, so as to expose them to insult, as they were generally condemned and > reproached for their conduct.Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 33 References References * External links *Grams, Laura. \\"Metrocles\\".

This can include strict ownership, or a number of other types of relation to a greater or lesser degree analogous to it. Most European languages feature possessive forms associated with personal pronouns, like the English my, mine, your, yours, his and so on. There are two main ways in which these can be used (and a variety of terminologies for each): * Together with a noun, as in my car, your sisters, his boss. Here the possessive form serves as an adjective or determiner, and may be called a possessive adjective, possessive determiner or adjectival possessive pronoun. * Without an accompanying noun, as in mine is red, I prefer yours, this book is his. A possessive used in this way is called a substantive possessive pronoun or an absolute pronoun. Some languages, including English, also have possessive forms derived from nouns or noun phrases, such as Jane's, cows' and nobody else's. These can be used in the same two ways as the pronoun-derived forms: adjectivally, as in Jane's office; and substantively, as in that one is Jane's. Possessives are sometimes regarded as a grammatical case (the possessive case), although they are also sometimes considered to represent the genitive case, or are not assigned to any case, depending on which language is being considered. On the other hand, some languages, such as the Cariban languages, can be said to have a possessed case, used to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship. A similar feature found in some languages is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, added to the (possessed) noun to indicate the possessor, as in the Finnish taloni (\\"my house\\"), where talo means \\"house\\" and the suffix -ni means \\"my\\". The concepts of possessive forms and genitive forms are sometimes conflated, although they are not exactly the same. The genitive form, which does not exist in modern English as an inflection, represents an of relationship, which may or may not be possessive; in other words, the possessive is a subset of genitive. For example, the genitive form \\"speed of the car\\" is equivalent to the possessive form \\"the car's speed\\". However, the genitive form \\"pack of dogs\\" is not the same as the possessive form \\"dogs' pack\\" (though it is the same as \\"dog pack\\", which is not possessive). The glossing abbreviation or may be used to indicate possessive forms. Formation =From pronouns= It is common for languages to have independent possessive determiners (adjectives) and possessive pronouns corresponding to the personal pronouns of the language. For example, to the English personal pronouns I, you, he, she, it, we, they, there correspond the respective possessive determiners my, your, his, her, its, our and their, and the (substantival) possessive pronouns mine, yours, his, hers, its (rare), ours and theirs. In some instances there is no difference in form between the determiner and the pronoun; examples include the English his (and its), and informal Finnish meidän (meaning either \\"our\\" or \\"ours\\"). In some languages, possessive determiners are subject to agreement with the noun they modify, and possessive pronouns may be subject to agreement with their antecedent, in terms of relevant categories of gender, number and case. For example, French has mon, ma, mes, respectively the masculine singular, feminine singular and plural forms corresponding to the English my, as well as the various possessive pronoun forms le mien, la mienne, les mien(ne)s corresponding to English mine. Since personal pronouns may also agree in number and gender with their own antecedent or referent, the possessive forms may consequently show agreement with either the \\"possessor\\" or the \\"possessed\\", or both. In French (and most other Romance languages) the third- person singular possessives do not indicate the gender of the possessor, although they agree with the possessed (son, sa and ses can all mean either \\"his\\", \\"her\\" or \\"its\\"). This contrasts with English and standard Dutch, where the form of the possessives (his, her, its; zijn, haar) indicates the grammatical or natural gender of the possessor, but does not depend on properties of the possessed. However German and several Dutch dialectsThese include Limburgish and Brabantian. additionally inflect their possessives, thus giving agreement with both possessor and possessed; German has sein and ihr meaning \\"his\\" and \\"her\\" respectively, but these inflect to give (for example) feminine forms like seine and ihre, depending on the gender (and number and case) of the thing possessed. In languages that have a genitive case, the possessive forms corresponding to pronouns may or may not resemble the genitive of those pronouns. For example, in Russian, the genitive of я ja \\"I\\" is меня menya (\\"of me\\"), whereas the corresponding possessive is мой moy (\\"my, mine\\", in masculine singular nominative form). In German the two sets of forms are quite similar (for example, the genitive of ich \\"I\\" is meiner, the corresponding possessive pronoun is also meiner in the masculine singular nominative, and the possessive determiner is mein with various endings). Some languages have no distinct possessive determiners as such, instead using a pronoun together with a possessive particle – a grammatical particle used to indicate possession. For example, in Japanese, \\"my\\" or \\"mine\\" can be expressed as watashi no, where watashi means \\"I\\" and no is the possessive particle. Similarly in Mandarin Chinese, \\"my\\" or \\"mine\\" is wǒ de, where wǒ means \\"I\\" and de is the possessive particle. An alternative to the pronominal possessive determiner, found in some languages, including Finnish and Hungarian, is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, attached to the noun denoting the thing possessed. For example, in Finnish the suffix -ni means \\"my\\", producing forms such as taloni (\\"my house\\"), from talo (\\"house\\"). Hungarian possessive suffixes are used in a similar way, as in háza (\\"his/her house\\"), formed from ház (\\"house\\"). In Hungarian this affix can also be used when the possessor is represented by a full noun, as described in the next section. Pronouns other than personal pronouns, if they have possessive forms, are likely to form them in a similar way to nouns (see below). In English, for example, possessive forms derived from other pronouns include one's, somebody's and nobody's. There is however a distinct form whose for the possessive of the interrogative and relative pronoun who; other languages may have similarly functioning words, such as the Russian чей chey (\\"whose?\\"). Another possessive found in Russian and other Slavic languages is the reflexive possessive, corresponding to the general reflexive pronoun; the Russian form is свой svoj (meaning \\"one's (own)\\", \\"my (own)\\", etc.). =From nouns= In some languages, possessives are formed from nouns or noun phrases. In English, this is done using the ending -'s, as in Jane's, heaven's, the boy's, those men's, or sometimes just an apostrophe, as in workers', Jesus', the soldiers'. Note that the ending can be added at the end of a noun phrase even when the phrase does not end with its head noun, as in the king of England's; this property inclines many linguists towards the view that the ending is a clitic rather than a case ending (see below, and further at English possessive). In languages that have a genitive case, the genitive form of a noun may sometimes be used as a possessive (as in German Karls Haus \\"Karl's house\\"). Languages such as Japanese and Chinese form possessive constructions with nouns using possessive particles, in the same way as described for pronouns above. An example from Japanese is neko no iro (\\"the cat's color\\"), where neko means \\"cat\\", no is the particle, and iro means \\"color\\". In other languages, noun possessives must be formed periphrastically, as in French la plume de ma tante (\\"my aunt's pen\\", literally \\"the pen of my aunt\\"). In Hungarian, the construction Mária háza is used (\\"Maria's house\\", literally \\"Maria her house\\", where the final -a in háza is the possessive suffix meaning \\"her\\"). The possessor noun can carry an additional dative marker, in which case an article appears before the noun. For example, \\"Peter's house\\" may be translated either as Péter háza (literally \\"Peter his-house\\"), or Péternek a háza (\\"of-Peter the his-house\\"). Syntax Possessive determiners (adjectives) are used in combination with a noun, playing the role of a determiner or attributive adjective. In English and some other languages, the use of such a word implies the definite article. For example, my car implies the car that belongs to me or is used by me; it is not correct to precede possessives with an article (*the my car) or other definite determiner such as a demonstrative (*this my car), although they can combine with quantifiers in the same ways that the can (all my cars, my three cars, etc.; see English determiners). This is not the case in all languages; for example in Italian the possessive is usually preceded by another determiner such as an article, as in la mia macchina (\\"my car\\", literally \\"the my car\\") or quel tuo libro (\\"that book of yours\\", literally \\"that your book\\"). Some languages place the possessive after the noun, as in Norwegian boka mi (\\"my book\\").In Norwegian bokmål written form, the phrase could alternatively be written as min bok due to bokmål's Danish heritage. Here again the equivalent of the definite article – in this case the definite ending -a on the noun bok – is used in addition to the possessive. However, the forms min bok or mi bok, where the noun bok is in the indefinite form, are equally correct. Possessive determiners may be modified with an adverb, as adjectives are, although not as freely or as commonly as is the case with adjectives. Such modification is generally limited to such adverbs as more, less, or as much ... as (comparative) or mostly (superlative), for example in This is more my team than your team and This is mostly my team. Substantival possessive pronouns are used on their own and cannot be used to describe a noun, playing the role of noun phrases, so mine may stand for \\"my cat\\", \\"my sister\\", \\"my things\\", etc. In some languages these may require articles or other determiners, as the French le mien etc. In English, the -'s possessives formed from nouns or noun phrases can be used in the same way; the president's may stand for \\"the president's office\\", \\"the president's policies\\", etc., as determined by the context. A related use is that of the predicative expression, as in sentences like the book is mine. Here mine may be considered to be a predicate adjective (like red in the book is red) rather than a pronoun; in English, however, the same possessive form is used anyway. Other languages may use differing forms; for example French may use ...est à moi for \\"...is mine\\". A particular use of possessive pronouns (and equivalent noun forms) in English is that illustrated in phrases like a friend of mine and that coat of Fred's, used to form possessive expressions when the desired determiner is something other than the default the implied in the usual possessive determiner. Terminology The terminology used for possessive words and phrases is not consistent among all grammarians and linguists. What some authors refer to as possessives, others may call genitives, and vice versa. Nowadays, however, the term genitive is most commonly used in relation to languages with a developed case system (in which the \\"genitive case\\" often has a wider range of functions than merely forming possessives), while in languages like English, where their status as a grammatical case is doubtful, such words are usually called possessives rather than genitives. A given language may have distinct genitive and possessive forms, as in the example of Russian given above. (The English possessive in -'s is sometimes called the Saxon genitive; this alludes to its derivation from the genitive case that existed in Old English. It may also be called the prenominal genitive; this also applies to analogous forms in languages such as German.) Words like the English my and your have traditionally been called possessive adjectives.Biber et al. (1999), pp. 270-72 However, some modern linguists note that in a language such as English they behave like determiners rather than true adjectives (see examples in the section above), and thus prefer to call them possessive determiners. In some other languages, however, the equivalent words behave more like true adjectives (compare the Italian example above, for instance). While for most authors the term possessive pronoun is reserved (as in this article) for possessives like mine and yours which do not qualify an explicit noun,All about grammar, p. 69, Rosemary Allen, 2007Easy French step- by-step, p. 210, Myrna Bell Rochester, McGraw Hill Professional, 2008 the term is sometimes taken also to include other possessive forms that correspond to pronouns, even though they behave as determiners, qualifying a noun, such as my and your.Jesperson (1949), pp. 399-405Biber et al. 1999, pp. 340-42 Some authors who classify both sets of words as possessive pronouns or genitive pronouns apply the terms dependent/independentPayne and Huddleston 2002, p. 426 or weak/strongQuirk et al. (1985) pp. 361-62 to refer, respectively, to my, your, etc. and mine, yours, etc. Thus my is termed a dependent (or weak) possessive pronoun, while mine is an independent (or strong) possessive pronoun. Also, the first set may be called adjectival and the second set substantival possessive pronouns. According to the OED,Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, possessive. the first reference to possessive pronouns is found in 1530; the first use of possessive as a noun occurs in 1591, the first use of possessive case (which notes that it is like the Latin genitive, and may be called the genitive case in reference to English also) occurs in 1763, and the first use of possessive adjective dates from 1870. Since has its equivalent in (ktētikós), in linguistic terminology possessives are also referred to as ktetics, particularly in reference to ktetic (possessive) adjectives, and other ktetic (possessive) forms, including names derived from ktetics (ktetic personal names). Possessive and possessed case Nouns or pronouns taking the form of a possessive are sometimes described as being in the possessive case. A more commonly used term in describing the grammar of various languages is genitive case, but that usually denotes a case with a broader range of functions than just producing possessive forms. (Some languages occasionally use the dative case to denote the possessor, as in the Serbo-Croatian kosa mu je gusta \\"his hair is thick\\" (literally \\"the hair to him is thick\\" in which \\"to him\\" is the dative pronoun mu). (ÖNB).) Other theorists reject the idea that the possessive in languages like English as represents a grammatical case since possessive forms do not generally behave in a parallel fashion to what are normally identified as cases. In particular, in English, as noted above, the -'s can attach to noun phrases even when they do not end with their head noun, as in the king of Spain's, which is not typical behavior for a case ending. For further discussion of the issue, see . Some languages, such as the Cariban languages can be said to have a possessed case to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship.\\"On reconstructing grammar: comparative Cariban morphosyntax\\", by Spike Gildea, , 1998, p. 104 In many Afro-Asiatic languages, such as Arabic, nouns take a form with similar significance called the construct state, sometimes even if the possessor is marked in the genitive case. Semantics The relationship expressed by possessive determiners and similar forms is not necessarily one of possession in the strict sense of ownership. In English, strict possession has been found to be expressed in only about 40% of the situations labeled as \\"possessive\\" by linguists, a fact which may incline some to prefer the more traditional term \\"genitive\\". The \\"possessor\\" may be, for example: *the person or thing to which the \\"possessed\\" stands in the designated relationship (my mother, his wife, your subordinates, our boss); *the person or thing of which the \\"possessed\\" is a part (my leg, the building's walls); *a person or thing affiliated with or identifying with the \\"possessed\\" (his country, our class, my people); *the performer, or sometimes the undergoer, of an action (his arrival, the government's overthrow) *the creator, supervisor, user, etc. of the \\"possessed\\" (Prince's album, the Irish jockey's horse).

He was an all-rounder and had represented India in Tests and One Day Internationals. He was an Assistant Coach of Indian cricket team for consecutive period of over five years (2014-2019). Early life Bangar was born in a village called Bhayala in Patoda, Dist Beed, Maharashtra, India to a Vanjari family.Jat Legends, Jat Samaj Mumbai.Jat sports persons, Jat Mahasabha. He has completed his schooling from Saint Francis De Sales High School Aurangabad. He completed his Bachelor of Commerce from Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College, Ghatkopar. He has also completed Company Secretaries Intermediate Course.  Playing career  Bangar began his career playing in the youth teams of Maharashtra and Mumbai, but at state level he made his name representing Railways who he has played for since the 1993–94 season. He often opened both the bowling and batting for Railways with his medium-pace bowling and sound defensive batting technique. In the 2000–01 season, Railways reached the final of the Ranji Trophy where they lost to Baroda. The following season, they went one better and defeated Baroda to win the competition. Bangar's performances had caught the eyes of the selectors and he was called up to the Indian squad for their matches against England in the 2001–02 season. In only his second Test, he scored 100 not out against Zimbabwe at Nagpur batting at number 7. On the 2002 tour of England, he was promoted to open the innings at Headingley after some poor performances by Wasim Jaffer. He responded with his most important innings for India, making a patient 68 on the first day in an invaluable partnership with Rahul Dravid in difficult swinging and seaming conditions. Later on in the same match he also chipped in with two important wickets to set up a rare innings victory for India away from home. Bangar was named as part of India's squad for the 2003 Cricket World Cup, but his performances for India began to tail off, and he made his final appearance for his country in 2004, appearing in 12 Test matches and 15 One Day Internationals in all. He made important contributions to 7 test match wins for India. He later became the captain of Railways and led them to two major championship titles, the Ranji Trophy and the Irani Trophy victory in 2004–05. He also led the Railways team to a Ranji Trophy One Day National Championship in 2005–06. Along with Vijay Hazare, he is only one of two players to score 6,000 runs and take 200 wickets in the Ranji Trophy. He represented Deccan Chargers in the first IPL season. He played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2009 IPL. In January 2013, Bangar announced his retirement after 20 years playing. An article by Sanjay Bangar was featured in the 2012 book Rahul Dravid: Timeless Steel.  Coaching career  Having previously coached India A, Bangar began working with the Kochi Tuskers as batting coach in 2010. In January 2014, Bangar was named assistant coach of Kings XI Punjab ahead of IPL 2014. He was promoted to the role of head coach during the season and coached them to final, the Franchise's best IPL performance to date, where they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. He went on to Coach Kings XI Punjab for three years until he had to give up his role to comply with the BCCI's conflict of interest rules.Bangar named Kings XI's coach In August 2014, he was named batting coach of India after an embarrassing Test series defeat to England.Shastri named director of cricket for England ODIs He was named head coach of India national cricket team for Zimbabwe tour in June 2016.Bangar named India coach for Zimbabwe tour After Anil Kumble was appointed as India's head coach for a one-year tenure starting with the tour of West Indies in July 2016, Bangar was reappointed as the team's batting coach. Many Indian batsmen, including Indian captain Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ajinkya Rahane, have openly credited Bangar for contributing to their growth. After Anil Kumble's tenure as head coach expired in June 2017, Bangar carried out the role of Interim Coach to India's tour of West Indies in June–July 2017. After Ravi Shastri's reappointment as head coach, Bangar was promoted to the role of Assistant Coach till 2019. Bangar's coaching has been credited for improving India's lower order. Bangar's tenure as batting coach saw India create several records, with Indian batsmen scoring over 150 centuries and India winning 30 tests out of 52 tests played, 82 ODIs out of 120 ODIs and the Test team staying at top of ICC Test Rankings for over three and half years during his tenure of over 5 years as coach. In 2018, India toured South Africa in what was considered a mixed bag, with India losing the test series 1-2 but later winning the ODI series by a record 5-1 margin, a feat not accomplished by any other Indian team. India then lost a closely contested Test Series in England by a margin of 1–4, with India's batting and Bangar's role came under criticism for unable to chase a 4th innings target of 193 set by England in the first test. However, later India won a historic Test Series in Australia 2–1, thus ending the 2018 season with 4 rare overseas Test victories in South Africa, England, and Australia. Bangar's contract was not renewed by the BCCI on the back of reports that Bangar was not able to find a suitable no 4 batsman in ODI cricket, a reason for India's loss in the 2019 World Cup, although it was widely debated that it was the job of the selectors and not the job of the batting coach to do so. As compared to previous foreign coaches, Bangar's performance was notable. Indian batsmen under him scored a total of 150 centuries including 89 overseas centuries, across formats.

The prom is also preceded by a Parade of students, typically with extravagant floats or other means of entry to the celebration. On June 1, 2019, The Pennsbury High School Senior Prom shattered the Guinness World Record for most number of lipstick kiss prints on a mural. The 63-foot- long, 11-foot-high 3D mural, which used 41,692 kisses, spelled out “Rock Music” to fit the theme of “Prom to the Music.” The centerpiece of the mural featured an 18-foot guitar. Students and community members created the kiss prints during sporting events, special school events, prom committee meetings, and in their own homes.  Instrumental Music  The Pennsbury School District has been recognized numerous times as one of the \\"Best Communities For Music Education\\" in the nation over the past 19 years. Some of its more notable ensembles include the Pennsbury High School \\"Long Orange Line\\" Marching Band and the Pennsbury Concert Jazz Band. The marching band has long been internationally recognized as one of the premier high school marching bands in the United States. The band currently holds the distinction of being the only marching band not affiliated with the Disney brand to have performed at five of the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The band has performed across the world with performances on five continents including Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China and on the Great Wall of China. In 2008, the band was the featured half-time performers at the International Rugby Tournament, “Hong Kong Sevens,” in Hong Kong, China.

After writing an article for the magazine about the 2002 prom, Bamberger went on to write a book, Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School, which chronicled the senior year of a group of Pennsbury students. The rights for the book were bought by Paramount, and MTV and Tollin/Robbins Productions were to produce the film, which had tentatively been named Pennsbury. In 2004, Mike Tollin and Brian Robbins signed with Walt Disney Studios, leaving the status of the project uncertain. Zach Woods, an alumnus of Pennsbury and actor known for his roles on The Office and Silicon Valley, is a character in this book, as is well-known political journalist Robert Costa. School bus accident On January 12, 2007, seventeen Pennsbury High School students were injured and hospitalized when a school bus veered into a group of students as they left school. After the driver placed the bus into gear, the engine began accelerating uncontrollably it then \\"jumped a curb outside one of the school buildings, drove over a sidewalk, barreled down an access road, mowed down a fence and slammed head-on into the retaining wall.\\" The very same bus in this accident had been involved in another accident under the same circumstances (although no students were injured) 10 years earlier. One student's leg was crushed and later had to be amputated above the knee. The NTSB announced they had \\"not found any major mechanical errors with the school bus\\". However all charges against the driver were dropped after two more buses of the same make and model crashed after experiencing the same mechanical issue.

See also Ripasso. The recipe is kept a secret. In 1919, after his best efforts to keep his brewery running Anders Lindahl moved to Stockholm, Sweden as a failed businessman, and founded Fructus Fabriker and began to make Pommac. The recipe was made by a Finland-Swedish inventor. The drink was made for the upper classes as an alcohol-free substitute for wine. Dr Pepper distributed a formulation of it in the US as a diet drink from 1963 to 1969 in six-and-a-half- and ten-ounce bottles. It took a while for people to become accustomed to the taste, so sales were slow. When sales remained stagnant after six years, and its sweetener, sodium cyclamate, was banned, Dr Pepper discontinued the product.. The original however had always used sugar as its sweetener. Pommac is also served as a non-alcoholic champagne alternative on festive occasions. In late 2004, Carlsberg in Denmark announced that they were going to cease production of Pommac for financial reasons. However, after overwhelming public demand (including a petition tallying over 50,000 signatures) were raised in response, the company decided to keep marketing Pommac.

In addition to Lilley and O'Keefe, other performers on the show included improvisational comedian Rebecca De Unamuno, experimental theatre star Melissa Madden Gray (now known internationally for her cabaret character 'Meow Meow'), Kate McCartney (who would go on to star in The Katering Show and Get Krack!n), Richard Pyros (today a member of The Sydney Theatre Company's 'Residents' acting ensemble) and Jake Stone, former lead singer of popular Australian funk pop rock band Bluejuice. Other television personalities associated with the show included now The Comedy Channel presenter Cameron Knight, comedian Charlie Pickering and actor Charlie Clausen. Many of the actors from this series would later appear on The Hamish and Andy Show. Regular cast member Tristan Jepson, who wrote and played Tom Gleisner in the show's acclaimed parody of The Panel committed suicide at the age of 26 in late 2004 after suffering from clinical depression. During the television broadcast of the 2005 Australian Film Institute Awards, Jepson was honoured among the roll call of performers to have died in the previous year. The show's co-creators included Andrew Jones and head writer Rick Kalowski, who have gone to success as a sought-after writing team. The show's directors included Ted Emery (Fast Forward, The Micallef Program, Kath & Kim) and Matthew Saville (Noise, We Can Be Heroes, The King) Big Bite was nominated for Best Television Comedy Series at the 2003 Australian Film Institute Awards, becoming the first commercial network comedy series ever nominated in any category of those awards. Media release A 2 DVD-set of the entire series (13 half-hour episodes) was released on DVD in Australia on 6 November 2006. The DVD included the so- called 'lost' final episode of the series, which had not aired on Australian television during the series' original run.

The main market for the aircraft is corporate transport and regional airliner operators. The PC-12 is the best-selling pressurized single-engine turbine- powered aircraft in the world and has been for several consecutive years, with 1,700 deliveries as of October 2019. Development Pratt & Whitney PT6 turboprop nose installation and 4 blade propeller PC-12 flight instruments and sub-panel In October 1989, Pilatus announced the development of the PC-12 at the annual convention of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA).\\"Booming Business.\\" Flight International, 23 September 1989. Prior to the 1989 announcement, the PC-12 project had been worked on for some time under high levels of secrecy; by the time of the announcement, assembly of the first prototype had already commenced. Pilatus believed that the PC-12 would fit a new market not served by existing aircraft and that the type would be the first single-engine aircraft capable of a large volume at high speed across long distances. The two prototypes were completed on 1 May 1991, with the first flight taking place on 31 May 1991. Swiss certification of the type had been originally planned for mid-1991; however, a redesign of the wings (increase of wingspan and addition of winglets to ensure performance guarantees were met) delayed progress. On 30 March 1994, the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation issued the type certificate for the PC-12; Federal Aviation Administration approval in the U.S. followed on 15 July 1994. Since entering service, Pilatus developed a large number of improvements and options upon the original PC-12 model; changes include increases in the maximum takeoff weight, the use of increasingly powerful engines, the adoption of new avionics, noise-reduction measures, new propellers, speed and range increases, additional interiors and new inflight entertainment systems.Grady, Mary. \\"Pilatus Offers New Upgrades for Its PC-12 NG.\\" Robb Report, 19 March 2014. Other aviation firms, such as Finoff Aviation Products, have also produced their own independent products and aftermarket enhancement packages for the PC-12. = PC-12NG = New blended winglet of the PC-12 NG Pilatus announced the PC-12NG (Next Generation) at the 2006 NBAA meeting in Orlando and officially launched it during the NBAA 2007 in Atlanta. The NG features a more powerful Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67P engine with better climb performance and an increase in maximum cruise speed to 280 knots TAS. The NG also features a Honeywell Primus Apex glass cockpit; prior to this, the PC-12 had been one of the few high end models to lack flat-panel avionics. The revised cockpit includes automatic pressurization control as well as cursor controlled inputs to the navigation system. The PC-12 NG winglets have also been modified from the original version. Within two years of launch, over 200 orders reportedly had been placed for the PC-12 NG. In May 2008, the first PC-12 NG was delivered. The PC-12M (Multipurpose) is based on the PC-12 NG but equipped with a more powerful electrical generation system that allows installing additional power-consuming equipment. This enables the PC-12M to perform missions such as flight inspection, air ambulance, aerial photography and aerial surveillance. An optional utility door accommodates parachute drops of people and cargo. This version is marketed in the United States as the PC-12 Spectre paramilitary special missions platform.\\"Pilatus PC-12 Spectre.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 20 February 2016. On 18 December 2012, Pilatus officially opened its Chinese headquarters in Chongqing Liangjiang and announced future manufacturing of the PC-12 for Asia-Pacific customers on the production line at this site.Wei, Xu. and Tan Yingzi. \\"Chongqing looking to the skies.\\" China Daily, 16 April 2013. In September 2014, it was announced that the production for various aerostructures for the PC-12 NG would be performed by Tata Aircraft Systems in India from 2016 onwards, these parts having previously been manufactured by PZL-Świdnik in Poland.Trautvetter, Chad. \\"Pilatus Taps India's Tata To Make PC-12 Aerostructures\\" AIN Online, 26 August 2014. Accessed: 4 September 2014.Roa, Nithin. \\"Batting for defence.\\" Tata Group, October 2014. = PC-12NGX = At the October 2019 NBAA convention, Pilatus announced the already certified PC-12NGX. Its PT6E-67XP includes a FADEC and low speed propeller mode to lower cabin noise. It reaches a 290 kn TAS (537 km/h) cruise. Updated Honeywell avionics with autothrottle feature both cursor control device and touchscreen. Adapted from the PC-24, the cabin windows are 10% larger and the redesigned cabin include new seats. Scheduled maintenance is extended to 600 flight hours and time between overhaul increases from 4,000 to 5,000 hours. Deliveries should start in the second quarter of 2020 at a US$ 4.39 million base price, up to 5.369 million typically equipped as an executive aircraft. Design Pilatus PC-12 taking off from a short unpaved airstrip The PC-12 is a single-engine turboprop- powered business aircraft, designed for performing multiple roles and to deliver performance and safety equal to twin-engine aircraft. It is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67 engine; early models being powered by the PT6A-67B, while the later PC-12 NG variant uses the more powerful PT6A-67P, which is flat rated at only 70% of its maximum power. According to Pilatus, the PC-12 NG has exceptional versatility and is capable of operating within the most rugged environments, such as the Australian outback; it is one of the few pressurized turbine-powered aircraft capable of operating from rough landing strips. A trailing arm landing gear allow access to airfields inaccessible to many jet aircraft. Pilatus PC-12 interior cabin A Luxembourg- registered PC-12/45 with doors open The cabin can accommodate up to nine passengers and has a refreshment centre, an enclosed lavatory and a rear baggage area. Other cabin configurations include executive arrangements, seating between six and eight passengers; a four-seat passenger-cargo combi layout; and an air ambulance setup housing two litters and three attending medics.\\"Pilatus PC-12 Service Bulletin No 25-014, see section 1C(3).\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 6 October 2011. The interior was designed in conjunction with BMW's Designworks division, making extensive use of leather, fine wood veneers, and various textiles to create an environment similar to a luxury road vehicle. An atypically large cargo door is installed to accommodate bulky items, including palletised cargo. The PC-12 incorporates numerous safety measures. The PT6A-67 engine has a reputation for considerable reliability, a factor that has reportedly been decisive to some prospective operators. To counteract stall and spin conditions, dual angle-of-attack sensors near the wingtips force the stick forwards in advance of a potential stall. For greater redundancy, the PC-12 NG has a complete split-bus dual electrical system similar to modern jet aircraft, in addition to two separate batteries and a third emergency battery. The type is certified for flight into known ice conditions; as per standard fit, pneumatic de-icing systems are installed in the wings and empennage, while electrical de-icing measures are integrated into the windshield and exhaust heat is used for engine inlet de-icing. In 2014, Aviation Week describe the PC-12 as possessing \\"...comparatively slow take-off and landing speeds, excellent short-field performance, and easy handling characteristics.\\" In addition to its uses as a passenger transport and private aircraft, the PC-12 can be configured as a multi-mission platform, such as an air ambulance or for conducting surveillance aircraft missions. In the latter role, a retractable Electro-optical/Infrared sensor may be installed into the aircraft's tail and an operator's console, containing two display monitors, a digital video recorder, communications panel and expansion bays to accommodate various radios and datalinks, can be fitted in the main cabin area; the aircraft may be highly customized to meet customer's specific mission requirements.Morrison, Murdo. \\"NBAA: Pilatus shows special mission Spectre PC-12.\\" Flight International, 11 October 2011. In the multi-mission capacity, the type has seen use by various customers, including the Red Cross, the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the United States Air Force. Right wingtip device and weather radar The type features a three-axis autopilot as standard, while weather radar, long-range navigation systems and radar altimeter are optional. The flight deck of the PC-12 NG is equipped with Honeywell's Primus Apex avionics system, consisting of four 10-inch high-resolution liquid crystal display screens, two of which perform as the primary flight displays directly forward of either pilot, the other two being multi-function displays in a central position between the two pilots. The Apex system shares many similarities to the flight decks of other business jets and has been designed to minimize crew workload and provide for improved safety during single-pilot operations. An advanced synthetic vision system, delivering greater situational awareness and safety during visual flight rules (VFR) flight, is also present. The cockpit's layout is optimized for ergonomic and aesthetic appeal, providing similar comfort levels for the flight crew as to the passengers. An engine condition monitoring system is present on the PC-12 NG, automatically monitoring engine parameters and producing relevant warnings, easing preventive maintenance efforts. Operational history =Commercial, corporate and private use= Early sales of the PC-12 principally went to utility operators, because Pilatus was reportedly uncertain of the sales potential for business and passenger operators. In 1994, the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia became the launch customer of the PC-12. It operates 32 PC-12s throughout Australia to deliver medical services in remote areas. PC-12 with passenger embarking In 2003, US charter airline Tradewind Aviation started operating the PC-12, which has now grown into one of the country's largest operators of the type, with 22 aircraft. In 2006, the magazine Flying referred to the PC-12 as \\"...more economical to operate than any turbine airplane of similar size.\\" In 2007, Flying magazine described the high rate of value retention on used PC-12s as \\"unbelievable\\"—attributing this to the popular demand for the type. High oil prices are a prominent factor for increasing sales of turboprops, the PC-12 among them. The bulk of demand comes from North America, and three- quarters of PC-12NG sales are in executive configurations. While its price grew from $3.3 million in 2005 to $4.7 million in 2015, it retains 80-85% of its selling price after 10 years given average use, better than comparable turboprop or business jets, and it sells 40% faster. Pilatus also uses a series of overseas distributors to market and sell the PC-12 within designated regions. AMAC Aerospace is the exclusive sales agent for the type within the Middle East. In August 2014, Californian airline Surf Air placed an order for 15 PC-12 NGs and 50 options, one of the largest contract for the type. PlaneSense, a New Hampshire-based fractional ownership company, manages the largest fleet of the type, operating 34 PC-12s as of 2015. In June 2010, Pilatus announced that the 1,000th PC-12 had been delivered. By August 2013, the worldwide PC-12 fleet had accumulated a combined total of 4 million flight hours and 1,200 PC-12s had been delivered to customers. Just over a year after the 1300th, the 1400th PC-12 was delivered in July 2016. As of July 2016, the fleet had accumulated 5.6 million total flight hours since certification and 1 million flight hours for the 630 PC-12 NG since its introduction in 2008. In May 2018, with the fleet having logged over 6.8 million hours, the maintenance interval was raised from 100/150 hours to 300 and a new maintenance plan reduced labor by 20% to 40% to lower direct operating costs. By 2017, a nine- year-old PC-12 was worth $2.5-2.8 million and 15- to 16-year-old models had a $1.8 million value. Owner-operators account for 20% to 30% of the PC-12 sales, while they fly 90% of all SOCATA TBMs. By October 2019, the PC-12 fleet surpassed 1,700 aircraft, with more than seven million total flight hours. =Military operations= United States Air Force U-28A The PC-12 is Pilatus' first aircraft directed principally at the civil market. Despite the company historically being a military-oriented supplier, military sales for the type were considered a low priority during the early stages of development. The U-28A is the United States Air Force variant of the PC-12 for intra-theater support of special operations forces performing the role of Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). The 319th Special Operations Squadron is stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida at the headquarters of the Air Force Special Operations Command. The 34th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) was activated on 9 April 2010 as the second U-28A unit at Hurlburt Field. Both squadrons operate as part of the 1st Special Operations Wing/ 1st Special Operations Group (SOG) at Hurlburt Field. The U-28A is also operated by the 318th Special Operations Squadron as part of the 27th Special Operations Wing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico.\\"New Special Ops PC-12 Unit.\\" AirForces Monthly, Issue 269, September 2010, p. 21. In May 2019 the Air Force officially approved the use of the name 'Draco' for the aircraft.

Stairways provide access to the horizontal rows of seats, often with every other step gaining access to a row of benches. Benches range from simple planks to elaborate ones with backrests. Many bleachers are open to the ground below so that there are only the planks to sit and walk on. Some bleachers have vertical panels beneath the benches, either partially or completely blocking the way to the ground.  Name origins  The open seating area in baseball was called the \\"bleaching boards\\" as early as 1877. The term \\"bleachers\\" used in the sense of benches for spectators can be traced back to at least 1889; named as such because the generally uncovered wooden boards were \\"bleached by the sun\\". The Dickson Baseball Dictionary lists as a secondary definition the fans sitting in them. By the early 1900s, the term \\"bleachers\\" was being used for both the seating area and its occupants. In modern usage, the term \\"bleachers\\" almost always refers only to the seating area, and those sitting there may be called \\"bleacher fans,\\" or \\"bleacherites.\\" Terms such as Chicago's \\"bleacher bums,\\" or Yankee Stadium's Bleacher Creatures are also used.  Types  Bleachers structures vary depending on the location, but most outdoor modern bleachers have either an aluminium tube or steel angle understructure (known as frame- type bleachers) or steel I-beams (known as an I-beam bleacher). Most smaller bleachers are frame-type bleachers and most larger bleachers are I-Beam bleachers. Bleachers range in size from small, modular, aluminum stands that can be moved around soccer or hockey fields to large permanent structures that flank each side of an American football field. Some bleachers have locker rooms underneath them. In indoor gyms, bleachers can be built in so that they slide on a track or on wheels and fold in an accordion-like, stacking manner. These type of bleachers are known as telescoping bleachers.  Baseball  In baseball stadiums, the bleachers are usually located beyond the outfield fences. However, center-field bleachers are located in the line of sight of the batter, and the presence of fans makes it difficult for the batter to pick out the ball. As a result, most stadiums have vacant areas or black backgrounds where the seats would be. This is known as either the \\"Backdrop\\" or the Batter's eye. The old Yankee Stadium featured black-painted vacant bleachers, nicknamed the black by baseball fans. Though many stadiums offer only bleacher seating, in those that offer both seats and bleachers, the bleachers are typically in less desirable locations and/or have lower ticket prices, giving the term \\"bleachers\\" a connotation of lower-class seating.  American football  The popularity of American football has made seating on outdoor and indoor football fields a necessity. Professional football, colleges, high schools, and even middle schools have bleacher systems set up to accommodate their fans. They vary in size from 10 feet wide that seat 25 all the way to full stadiums that seat thousands and wrap around the entire field. It is not uncommon to see football bleachers that rise hundreds of feet into the air. American Football bleachers are commonly made from concrete or aluminum with concrete footings or superstructure underneath.

The name Pearblossom came from the multitude of local pear farms along the southern ridge of the Antelope Valley. A few still exist today, but most of those farms are now abandoned and have returned to the desert landscape or have been overridden by small-scale housing development. Pearblossom is also a popular destination, for its annual Duck Races; convenient location for hiking in the foothills; and picturesque photo opportunities. Pearblossom is well known by Southlanders as the home of one of the most dangerous roads in the US. State Route 138 (Pearblossom Highway) is the main street in Pearblossom and as of 2004 has been the location of numerous serious and fatal automobile accidents in its Palmdale to I-15 segment. Daily traffic on the recently expanded highway ranges from 25,000 to 30,000 vehicles, including many short & long haul freight trucks. Overuse of Pearblossom Highway is chiefly on Friday evenings, Saturdays and Sundays, the time period many use the route to travel to Las Vegas. This section of 138's route is commonly used as a bypass of the Los Angeles Metropolitan region, and as a route from the Antelope Valley to the Inland Empire. Highway 138 or Pearblossom Highway has been somewhat improved, now with three or four lanes along some segments, and some of the dips taken out of the highway in many of the most dangerous areas.

It is the headquarters of the Bidar district which borders Maharashtra and Telangana. It is a rapidly urbanising city in the wider Bidar Metropolitan area. The city is well known for its many sites of architectural, historical and religious importance. Being located at the farthest of around from the state capital Bengaluru, it has been neglected by the state government for a long time. However, owing to its rich heritage, the city has a prominent place on the Archaeological Map of India. Picturesquely perched on the Deccan plateau, the Bidar fort is more than 500 years old and still standing strong. According to the book \\"Bidar Heritage\\" published by the state Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage, of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are tombs located in and around Bidar city., explaining its nickname, \\"City of Whispering Monuments\\". The heritage sites in and around Bidar have become the major attraction for film shooting in recent years with Bollywood making visits apart from kannada film industry Bidar is home for the second biggest Indian Air Force training centre in the country. The IAF Station Bidar is used for advanced jet training of prospective fighter pilots on BAe Hawk aircraft. Bidar city is known for its Bidri handicraft products, and its rich history. Bidar is also considered one of the holiest place for Sikh pilgrimage. Unlike other places in the region, Bidar is the coldest and wettest place in north Karnataka. For the year 2009–10, Bidar was ranked 22nd among the cleanest cities in India, and 5th cleanest in Karnataka. SH4 passes through Bidar and the whole city is integrated with 4 lane road. Ancient Karez System in the city have been recently discovered. The Karez (Qanat) is an underground network of aqueducts for water supply. The Bidar Karez, built in the 15th century, is more than long with 21 air vents. Underground canals, built to connect underground water streams, were meant to provide drinking water to civilian settlements and the garrison inside the Bidar fort. This was necessary in a city where the soil was rocky and drilling wells was difficult.  Etymology  Bidar is believed to have got its name from Bidri works. Legend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of Vidarbha, to which references are found in early Hindu literature like Malavikagnimitra, Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, Bhagavata, and a few other Puranas. Its association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names Bidar and Vidarbha. This has been mentioned in Firishta's writings. The traditional tales reveal that Vidura lived here; hence the place was earlier called Viduranagara and also as the place where Nala and Damayanti (Daughter of Raja Bhima, the King of Vidharba) were meeting. Bidar under the rule of the Bahmani Sultanate was known as Muhammadabad.  History  The recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the Mauryan Empire. After the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Kadambas, and Chalukyas of Badami and later the Rashtrakutas reigned over Bidar territory. The Chalukyas of Kalyana and Kalachuris of Kalyanis also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the Seunas of Devagiri and Kakatiyas of Warangal. The Delhi Sultanate invaded the area first by Allauddin Khilji, and later, Muhammed-bin-Tughluq took control of entire Deccan including Bidar. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi's officers that were stationed in Deccan rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of Bahmanid Dynasty in 1347 A.D. at Gulbarga/Hasanabad (present Kalaburagi). There was frequent warfare between the Bahmanids and the Vijaynagar Kingdom.http://www.bidartourism.com/history.html The history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, the first sultan of the Bahmani dynasty to 1427, when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land. The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and strong fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the Tughlaq dynasty. With the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422–1486), Bidar was made the capital city of Bahmani Kingdom. The old fort was rebuilt and madrasas, mosques, palaces, and gardens were raised. Mahmud Gawan, who became the Prime Minister in 1466, was a notable figure in the history of Bidar. Bidar remained under the Barid Shahi dynasty until conquest by the Bijapur Sultanate in 1619. Aurangzeb came to Bidar after his father, Padshah (emperor) Shah Jahan, appointed him the Prince of Deccan. He wrested the Bidar Fort from the Adil Shahis after a 21-day war in 1656. With this, Bidar became a part of the Mughal dynasty for the second time. Bidar was made a subah (imperial top-level province) in 1656, which Telangana Subah was merged into the next year. In 1724, Bidar became a part of the Asaf Jahi Kingdom of the Nizams. Third son of Asaf jah l ( Nizam l ) Mir Sa'id Muhammad Khan, Salabat Jang ruled from Bidar fort from 1751 to 1762, till his brother Mir Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah III imprisoned him in this fort, and was killed in Bidar fort on 16 September 1763. Mohammedabad old name of Bidar is also on his name. It was connected to Hyderabad by rail in the early 20th century. After India's independence, in 1956 all Kannada speaking areas were merged to form the Mysore State and Bidar became part of the new Mysore (now Karnataka) state.  Geography  Bidar is located at , lies at a central position in Deccan, a plateau at an elevation of 2300 ft from the sea level. It has common boundaries with Maharashtra and Telangana which is, with the districts of Nizamabad and Medak in Telangana on the East and the districts of Nanded and Osmanabad in Maharashtra on the west. On the south lies the district Gulbarga of Karnataka. = Geology = Laterite under the Top soil Layer The upper crust of the plateau is of laterite, a soft porous rock with limonitic surface. This crust varies in depth from to and rests on a bed of trap, which is of much harder texture and less pervious to water. The volume of water filtered during the monsoons through the laterite stratum is arrested by the trappean bed, and a nursery of springs is formed whose natural level of effluence is the line of contact of the two strata along the base of the cliffs of the plateau. The water in course of time frets out for itself an orifice and macerates and loosens portions of its rocky channel till a rift is produced. The rift gradually dilates into a ravine, and the ravine expands into a vale. The Karez System is built along a geological fracture. Such fractures are formed at the intersection of laterite and basalt rocks and form lineaments or springs that yield water. = Soil = Bidar soils are deep (>100 cm), well-drained gravelly red clayey soils developed on plateaus of laterites. They are slightly acid to neutral (pH 6.6) in reaction with low cation exchange capacity. They are highly gravelly soils with gravel content (60 to 10%) that decrease with depth.Characterisation of sugarcane soils of Karnataka L.C.K.

Bidar is one of the coldest cities (by southern standards) in Karnataka as the minimum temperature during winter nights regularly hovers around 11-12 during December, which is the coldest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 27.3 C and mean daily minimum of 13.4 C. From the middle of the February, both day and night temperatures begin to rise rapidly. May is the hottest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 38.8 C and mean daily minimum of 25.9 C. With the withdrawal of southwest monsoon in the first week of October, there is slight increase in day temperature but night temperature decreases steadily. After October, both day and night temperatures decreases progressively. The highest maximum temperature recorded at Bidar was on 8-5-1931(43.3-degree C) and the lowest minimum was on 5-1-1901(2.9-degree C, the lowest temperature ever recorded in Karnataka). Present day Bidar covers an expanse of 5448 square kilometres of land and lies between 17°35' and 18°25' North latitudes and 76°42' and 77°39' east longitudes. Economy Once a home to many cottage industries, such as cotton and oil-ginning mills,Bidar District Gazetteer, Govt. Printing Press, Bangalore, 1977. there are now few industries that draw on local raw materials or skills. Even the well known form of local articrafts, bidri ware, is in a state of decline. Increasing prices of materials, especially silver, and declining sales have meant that many of the hereditary artisans are no longer employed in the production of such ware.Agrarian Distress in Bidar, A report by NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED STUDIES, 1999 Bidar city has a large industrial area known as Kolhar industrial area. Tourism Bidar is symbolically described as City of Whispering Monuments. The mountaintop city that served as the capital of medieval Deccan, has 98 monuments of which four national monuments are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and 14 by the State Archaeology Department, Karnataka. Bidar earned a place on the World Monument Watchlist 2014. Of the 741 proposals received from 166 countries, 67 sites from 41 countries were finally selected which were announced by WMF president Bonnie Burnham in New York on 8 October 2013. Along with \\"the historic city of Bidar\\", two other sites in India to figure in the list were the house of Sheikh Salim Chisti in Fatehpur Sikri and Juna Mahal in Rajasthan. The WMF in its current watch site for \\"the historic city of Bidar\\" says ″challenges to the site include a lack of integrated conservation and maintenance, environmental pollution, and the construction of new developments and roadways that encroach on the historic fabric. Current land use regulations also threaten the economic livelihood of many of the city's residents, and it is hoped that revised, context-specific planning policies would both protect Bidar's historic assets while also supporting the future of its local population. It is hoped that Watch-listing will spur documentation and analysis of the city's conditions, followed by policy development and applied conservation interventions that will reveal and maintain Bidar's rich heritage, as well as support a robust and sustainable tourist industry.″ =Mahmud Gawan Madrasa= This grandiose madrasa was built by the prime- minister of the Bahmani empire, Mahmud Gawan in the late 15th century. Its only the most imposing building of the Bahmani period, but in its plan and in the general style of its architecture it is a unique monument of its kind in India. The Madrasa, a multi-disciplinary university he set up, which had a library of around 3,000 valuable manuscripts, was severely damaged when gunpowder stored inside the rooms went off during a 27-day siege of the city by Mughal king Aurangazeb in 1656. The Mahmud Gawan Madrasa is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. = Bidar Fort = Bidar FortBidar Fort is considered one of the most formidable forts of the country. Bidar city was distinctly planned and built. The main citadel complex housed the royal places. Mahals and Mosque. Adjoining to this on the southern side, the city was built for the people. Both the citadel complex and city had separate forts for protection the plan of the Bidar city fortification is pentagonal. There are five gateways for entry into the city fort.

The coronations of several Bahamanis and Barid Shahi sultans were held there. From the royal pavilion which is situated behind throne palace one can view the valley and low land below. *Solah Khamba Mosque (Solah Sutoon Ki Masjid) was built by Qubil Sultani between 1423 and 1424. The mosque derives its name from the 16 pillars that are lined in the front of the structure. Popularly known as the Zanana Masjid, this mosque is about 90 metres long and 24 metres wide. Behind the southern wall of this mosque, there is a large well. Characterised by columns, arches and domes, this mosque is one of the largest in India. = Other monuments = *Chaubara is a tall tower, facing in four directions.

The practice has since spread to Commonwealth countries and the United States. The school is divided into subunits called \\"houses\\" and each student is allocated to one house at the moment of enrolment. Houses may compete with one another at sports and maybe in other ways, thus providing a focus for group loyalty. Different schools will have different numbers of houses, with different numbers of students per house depending on the total number of students attending the school. Facilities, such as pastoral care, may be provided on a house basis to a greater or lesser extent depending on the type of school. Historically, the house system was associated with established public schools in England, especially full boarding schools, where a \\"house\\" referred to a boarding house at the school. In modern times, in both day and boarding schools, the word house may refer only to a grouping of pupils, rather than to a particular building. Houses may be named after saints, famous historical alumni or notable regional topics (e.g. in international schools, houses are sometimes named in honor of local celebrities). Other more arbitrary names—animal names or colours, for example—are also often used. Houses are also often referred to by the original name of the building or by the name or initials of the teacher in charge of the house (housemistress or housemaster). Each house will usually also be identified by its own symbol, logo, or colours. At co-educational boarding schools, there may be separate houses for boys and girls, as at the Lawrenceville School, whose house system is itself based on that of Rugby School. Students may also be grouped by year groups or status as boarders or day students. At Winchester College and Eton College, there is a separate house for foundation scholars. Where the school has boarders and day pupils like the King's School, Canterbury or Shrewsbury School, they will often be allocated to separate houses. There have also been cases, for example at Cheltenham College, of pupils being allocated to different houses according to their religion. At traditional full boarding schools such as Radley College and Harrow School, students are grouped by boarding house. Pastoral care Especially at a boarding school, one of the main purposes of the house system is to provide pastoral care to the students. With parents absent, children are likely to depend on the school to look after their basic physical, social and emotional needs. Competition between houses A secondary feature of house systems is the competition between houses. For example, the traditional school sports day is usually an inter- house competition. Debating competitions and charity drives are also often organised along inter-house lines. Merit points for behaviour and academic achievement may also be totalled up for comparison between houses. Some schools have a year-long programme of inter-house events, in which each house \\"hosts\\" an event at which all houses compete, with points contributing to the award of the House Cup at the end of the year. Shrewsbury School and Eton College still maintain an annual bumps race between houses, which was carried on by old boys to Oxford and Cambridge colleges, both of which still race in bumps; Shrewsbury and Eton race in fours, whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights. Membership and roles Pupils are usually assigned to houses randomly, perhaps with the aim of balancing the houses in order to increase competition. Sometimes the assignment is based on the social and emotional needs of the student and to ensure proper peer mentoring is enhanced with the right fit of students within a house. Traditionally, however, once a pupil has been assigned to a house, any younger siblings he or she has may automatically become members of that house when they arrive at the school, but this varies from school to school. (This tradition sometimes extends to the children of former pupils.) Once a pupil has been allocated to a house they usually stay with that house as they move up through the year groups. In some schools, pupils may move to a house for senior pupils in Sixth Form. One notable feature of the house system is the appointment of house captains, and maybe other house prefects, who exercise limited authority within the house and assist in the organisation of the house. Large schools may have a house captain for each year group (with vice-captains in the largest schools). In boarding schools, the term housemaster or housemistress is the title held by the member of staff responsible for pupils living in a particular house (or dormitory). In state schools, members of staff are appointed as (or volunteer to become) head of house. However, both terms can be used at either style of school for the sake of formality. In some cases, houses may have their own staff members other than housemaster or housemistress. Other uses The term \\"house system\\" is also used to refer to the residential college systems found in some US colleges and universities, such as Rice University, Caltech, Yale College, Harvard College, Notre Dame, and University of Chicago. These systems are based on the college systems of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the United Kingdom, which in turn share many similarities with the house systems of British secondary schools. Prominence in school stories The first boarding-school story was Sarah Fielding's The Governess, or The Little Female Academy, published in 1749. The genre did not become popular until 1857, with Thomas Hughes' novel Tom Brown's School Days. The house system has since featured prominently in thousands of school stories books, with many authors writing a whole series of books such as Chalet School and Malory Towers which have been published around the world and translated into several languages. The Harry Potter books and films (re)popularized this genre, and resulted in unprecedented awareness of British boarding schools (and their house system) in countries where they were previously unknown. These stories depict the popular conception of a British boarding school rather than how modern boarding schools work in reality, and often focus on the most positive aspects. For example, loyalty to one's house is very important in real-life houses, and features prominently in many of these books. The Harry Potter books have updated the boarding school to 21st-century values, for example by depicting mixed-sex education houses. Most Britons never went to a boarding school, but have integrated their values by reading these books. The translators of some foreign editions of the Harry Potter books had difficulties conveying the \\"house\\" concept in languages like Russian or German, because there was no word that could adequately convey the importance of belonging to a certain house, the loyalty owed to one's house, and the pride in the prizes won by one's own house. This forces translators to insert extra explanations in the dialogue, making foreign readers think that the house and boarding systems were a special feature of the fantasy setting rather than a real-world feature which would not need to be explained to a typical British child. The French translation does not explain the differences between the French and English real-world boarding schools, instead having the house system and the head boys explained as peculiarities of Hogwarts.

It is a part of the municipality of Medemblik, and lies about 12 km north of Hoorn. It has a certain fame for its local variety of potatoes, \\"Opperdoezer Ronde\\". The village used to be called Doess, which means 'low woods'. History 250px The exact age of the village of Opperdoes is hard to determine. The village used to be located very close to the sea, and the area has been flooded several times. Initial settlements seem to have been abandoned after the year 300 because of large floods. New villages were later built on terps. Opperdoes used to be located 4 or 5 kilometres from the sea-dike that existed around 781. However, the dike was in a very bad condition and in 1318 Willem van Henegouwen, the ruler, agreed the build a new dike. In 1334 a new dike was built between Medemblik and Barsingerhorn. The new dike was built 4 kilometres southwards of the old one and Almersdorp, a village, was left outside the new dike. In 1517 the old church of Opperdoes and many buildings were destroyed by Grote Pier and his Frisian army, the Gelderse Friezen. A new church was built, and it was ready in 1530. The top of the tower of the church was replaced in 1838, after it was destroyed in a storm in November 1836. Opperdoes was a separate municipality between 1817 and 1979, when the new municipality of Noorder-Koggenland was created. Important buildings and locations A touristic attraction is the old steam railway station on the railway between Hoorn and Medemblik. Religion Religion has played an important part in the village in the last two centuries. Opperdoes is considered an orthodox village in a fairly liberal minded area. In earlier times the villagers of Opperdoes were called the Turks: they were a particularly free-minded people, in line with the other villages in the area, that enjoyed life to the fullest. Around 1822 Jan Mazereeuw, the so-called Profete of Opperdoes, preached in the village. He was a farmer and had been mayor of the village for a while during the French occupation. He called the Reformed Church a godless temple and preached a very sober lifestyle. Although he never had a large crowd of followers, it is generally assumed that a part of the village's orthodoxy can be explained by his preachings. Famous people Opperdoes is the birthplace of Pieter Wijdenes, a Dutch mathematician and teacher. Statistics In 2001, the village centre of Opperdoes had 1442 inhabitants. The built-up area of the village was 0.31 km², and contained 555 residences.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Bevolkingskernen in Nederland 2001 . Statistics are for the continuous built-up area.

Career = Early stages = Bettina Rheims' photographic career began in 1978, when she took a series of photos of a group of strip-tease artists and acrobats, which would lead to her first exhibitions. This work would unveil Bettina Rheims' favourite subject, the female model, to which she would frequently return during her career. \\"I love the flesh. I am a photographer of the skin\\". The 1980s provided Bettina Rheims with the opportunity to take several portraits of both famous and unknown women, resulting in the publication of Female Trouble (1989). In 1982, the Animal series enabled her to train her lens on another form of nudity: that of stuffed animals with fixed stares, \\"which seemed to want to express something beyond death\\". \\"I had to capture their gaze\\" declared the photographer. With Modern Lovers (1989-1990) [note] the photographer questioned gender, androgyny and transsexuality. Two other publications on the same subject followed: Les Espionnes (1992) and Kim (1994). = The 1990s = At the beginning of the 1990s, Bettina Rheims worked on one of her major series, entitled Chambre Close (1990-1992). This was her first in colour and marked the start of her collaboration with the novelist Serge Bramly, in a work which saw her photographs coupled with the writer's fiction. In its form, Chambre Close is a parody of the first pornographic photos — rooms with faded walls, old fashioned wallpaper — yet, in its substance, it endeavours to stage amateur models in poses playing on the eroticism and the confusion between those who are looking and those who are showing themselves. \\"By using colour and extreme quality printings, the flesh appears living and gives a disconcerting realism to the work. Bettina Rheims thus transcends the body to reach primitive femininity in her psychoanalytical \\"id\\" - her more or less pent-up impulses, sexual impulses in particular. At the same time as these impulses show through the surface, the awareness of the model, through her skin, the artist captures them on film.\\" In 1995, Bettina Rheims was invited by Jacques Chirac at the end of his presidential campaign to work behind the scenes on a series of photographs following the final stages of the election. After the election, the Presidency of the French Republic commissioned Bettina Rheims to take the official portrait of Jacques Chirac. She told the newspaper Libération that she'd wanted to give the President \\"the relaxed look of the great heroes in westerns\\". The decade drew to a close with the 1999 publication of the book I.N.R.I. and its eponymous exhibition. Once again uniting the gaze of Bettina Rheims with the prose of Serge Bramly, I.N.R.I. builds a philosophical dialogue on the history of the crucifixion through photographs of scenes of the life of Christ, from the Annunciation to the Ascension. Bettina Rheims proposed \\"illustrations in step with our times, after the appearance of photography, cinema and advertising imagery, as if Jesus were returning today.\\" [note]. In France, the publication of this work was highly controversial. = The 2000s = In 2002, Bettina Rheims created a series on Shanghai during two long stays in the city. \\"The first impressions of a traveller arriving in Shanghai are those of people with deep-rooted ancestral rituals and traditions who threw themselves into the frenetic race of the present-day world. Blending into this 'other way of thought' and without any prejudices, Bettina Rheims offers us a novel view of this paradox, which is the coexistence of China with its millenary traditions, its avant-garde facet, its official aspects and its underground features.\\" In 2005, at the Galerie De Noirmont, Bettina Rheims exhibited Héroïnes, a work that was primarily a homage to sculpture. On this occasion, the photographer collaborated with the designer Jean Colonna [note interne W] to dress the women in original clothing. \\"Old haute couture dresses were thus re-assembled on each of these contemporary icons. These women, with their unconventional beauty, then played with a stone, which for a moment became their pedestal.\\" At the end of the 2000s, Bettina Rheims worked with Serge Bramly again and exhibited Rose, c'est Paris in 2010 at the National Library of France. The photographic tale was again built on a thread of fiction that Bettina Rheims and Serge Bramly created from autobiographical elements. In this work, Paris plays \\"the role of the muse more than the subject, and [appears], through the characters woven into a story, in an almost allegorical form. A young woman we know by her initial, B., is looking for Rose, her twin sister who she claims has disappeared. Presented as a 'great mysterious series', a genre held dear by surrealists, Rose, c'est Paris is divided into thirteen episodes in which we discover among other things an unusual or obscure Paris, which is voluntarily timeless.\\" = The 2010s = Exhibited in 2012 in Düsseldorf, the Gender Studies series pursues the questioning of gender representation. The device linking image and sound (by Frédéric Sanchez) presents 27 sound portraits of young men and women who responded to a request the photographer posted on Facebook. The photos are accompanied by interview clips and have featured in several exhibitions and a book. = Commissioned work and portraits of famous women = Rheims has also worked on advertising campaigns for fashion and big brands, such as Chanel and Lancôme, as well as taking portraits of famous women for international magazines. Among the most famous portraits, we can mention Madonna, Catherine Deneuve, Charlotte Rampling, Carole Bouquet, Marianne Faithfull, Barbara, Kylie Minogue, Claudia Schiffer, Asia Argento….  Inspiration  Bettina Rheims says that she has been inspired by Diane Arbus and Helmut Newton as well as by the work of early painters.

The mayor is İsmail Yıldırım (AKP). Karamürsel is on the coast of Izmit Bay and has beautiful shores. It has a famous basket known as Karamürsel basket, which is mainly used in collecting fruit like cherries, etc.. The characteristic of this handwoven basket is that it looks small to the eye but has a much bigger capacity than one would think. Karamürsel also holds special significance for the Turkish Navy, as it was here in 1323 that the Ottoman Empire first established its outlet to the sea, thus laying the foundations for the Ottoman Navy which would go on to dominate the eastern Mediterranean for several centuries. Overview Karamürsel is historically known as The Town of The Wrestlers, and was called for centuries Praenetos (Πραινετός in Greek) before its conquest by the Ottomans. It has also been well known with its fish restaurants that also attract customers from nearby area. Handmade silk carpet production (the famous Hereke rugs are produced here too), fruit production (cherry, peach, plums, figs, pears, apples), and olive production are sources of income for the locals. It is not heavily industrialized like other parts of the province, and therefore Karamürsel's natural beauties are more intact compared to the rest of the province of Kocaeli. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Karamürsel had a total population of 25.322, consisting of 11.023 Greeks, 10.732 Muslims, 3.549 Armenians and 18 foreign citizens.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 128-129 The people living in Karamürsel and its villages are mainly Muslim Manav Turks and immigrants known as Muhacir in Turkish. On the other hand, some immigrants came from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Lazistan, Georgia, Circassia and Crimea, and arrived in the country during/after the fall of Ottoman Empire. Due to its rich ethnic structure it displays a wide array of cultures, heavily influenced by that of Balkan and Caucasus. Recently the town has also started attracting immigration from other parts of Turkey, especially from the Black Sea region. Karamürsel was heavily damaged during the devastating 1999 İzmit earthquake (August 17, 1999) which rocked the eastern part of Marmara Region. 164 people lost their lives in Karamürsel in the earthquake, and many were left homeless. After the earthquake many people left this town for other parts of Turkey, and the place had a resemblance of a ghost-town for the winter of 1999. It is now returning to its old days, with the houses being repaired and the business being reopened. During the earthquake, a considerably damaging tsunami hit both the northern and southern sides of the İzmit bay in about one minute. Even the tsunami was not very large, subsidence and coastal landslides, have left a substantial portion of the towns of Gölcük, Degirmendere and Karamürsel inundated by the sea (Altinok et al., 1999). The coast of Karamürsel is now repaired and reconstructed. Karamürsel has a very long history of being an important base for the navy. The first Ottoman shipyard was built on the Bay of İzmit in 1327 in Karamürsel. The ships built there constituted first nucleus of the Ottoman Naval Forces. Due to its strategic and naturally protected location, Karamürsel has been used as a naval base that controls Black Sea. In addition a U.S. military base was located in Karamürsel for many years during the Cold War for the purpose of intercepting Russian radio transmissions. The station, containing a huge 500-foot-diameter antenna array AN/FLR-9, called Elephant Cage, was there from 1957 until 1979. This huge landmark was visible from everywhere in Karamürsel, from villages on the hills surrounding the town, and also from the shores across the Izmit Bay. After the US military left the base was transferred to Turkish Navy, and is still in operation today. The US military however took an important chip from the antenna, so that it would not be used after they left. The Turkish military eventually took out the antenna in the mid 1990s, however everyone still remembers this immense structure. In 1958, a U.S. military dependents USDESEA Educational System school was opened on the Karamürsel Air Station. Beginning as an elementary level school, the school was eventually expanded to include middle school students and eventually included both junior and senior high school students. In 1961, a new school building was constructed and served the educational needs of the military personnel's children until the base itself was closed in 1979. In addition to the students that lived on the base with their active duty parents, the American dependent's school on Karamürsel Air Station (KCDI) became a regional boarding school that now included grades nine through twelve. High school age students whose parents were stationed in other Turkish locations, those stationed in Iraklion Air Station, Crete, and the children of civilian federal employees that worked for the VOA (Voice of America) radio station in Xanthi, Greece now attended high school in Karamürsel. Housed in military barracks, the dormitory students were supervised by federal civilian employees referred to as dorm counselors.

Located at a distance of 15,800 light-years (4,850 pc), it is the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years. It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars and a total mass equivalent to 4 million solar masses, making it the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way. Omega Centauri is so different from the other galactic globular clusters that it is thought to have an alternative origin as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. Observation history In 150 AD, Greco-Roman writer and astronomer Ptolemy catalogued this object in his Almagest as a star on the horse's back, \\"Quae est in principio scapulae\\". German lawyer and cartographer Johann Bayer used Ptolemy's data to designate this object \\"Omega Centauri\\" with his 1603 publication of Uranometria. Available at: Linda Hall Library (University of Missouri (Kansas City, Missouri, USA)) The pages of this book are not numbered. However, towards the end of the book there appears \\"Tabula quadragesima prima, Centaurus.\\" (Forty-first table, Centaur). The table lists Omega Centauri as \\"21 ω In imo dorso\\" (21 ω At the bottom of the back). The following page shows the constellation Centaur and Omega Centauri as a star labelled ω at the base of the Centaur's back. Using a telescope from the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, English astronomer Edmond Halley rediscovered this object in 1677, listing it as a non-stellar object. In 1716, it was published by Halley among his list of six \\"luminous spots or patches\\" in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.See: * ; see p. 391. * Reprinted at: SEDS: The Messier Catalog Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux included Omega Centauri in his 1746 list of 21 nebulae,Cheseaux compiled a list of nebulae during 1745–1746. He sent the list to his grandfather, in the form of a letter. The letter was read before the French Academy of Sciences in 1746. However, it was first published only in 1892 as part of a large article by the French astronomer Guillaume Bigourdan. * Cheseaux's letter (in French) appears on pp. G-8 – G-9. * An English translation of Cheseaux's letter appears in: An English translation of Cheseaux's letter appears on pp. 105–106. Available at: SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System * See also: Philippe Loys de Chéseaux (May 4, 1718 – November 30, 1751) at SEDS: The Messier Catalog as did French astronomer Lacaille in 1755, whence the catalogue number is designated L I.5. ; see in the table on p. 196: \\"Nébuleuse du Centaure … \\" Note: The catalog number \\"L I.5\\" designates: that the nebula is listed in Lacaille's catalog of 1755 (hence the \\"L\\"); that Omega Centauri is a nebula of the \\"first type\\" (première espèce, namely, nebulae that do not seem to be accompanied by stars when viewed via a telescope that is 2 feet long; hence the Roman numeral \\"I\\"); and that Omega Centauri is listed fifth among the nebulae of the first type (hence the \\"5\\"). See: Deep Sky Observer's Companion – the online database It was first recognized as a globular cluster by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop in 1826, who described it as a \\"beautiful globe of stars very gradually and moderately compressed to the centre\\". Properties At a distance of about 15,800 light-years (4,850 pc) from Earth, Omega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eye—and appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area. It is the brightest, largest and, at 4 million solar masses, the most massive known globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. Of all the globular clusters in the Local Group of galaxies, only Mayall II in the Andromeda Galaxy is brighter and more massive. Orbiting through the Milky Way, Omega Centauri contains several million Population II stars and is about 12 billion years old. The stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are estimated to average only 0.1 light years away from each other. The internal dynamics have been analyzed using measurements of the radial velocities of 469 stars. The members of this cluster are orbiting the center of mass with a peak velocity dispersion of 7.9 km s−1. The mass distribution inferred from the kinematics is slightly more extended than, though not strongly inconsistent with, the luminosity distribution. Evidence of a central black hole The central region of Omega Centauri. The lower illustration charts the future positions of the stars highlighted by the white box in the top image. Each streak represents the star's predicted motion over the next 600 years. The period between dots corresponds to 30 years. October 2010 A 2008 study presented evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of Omega Centauri, based on observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pachon in Chile. Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys showed that stars are bunching up near the center of Omega Centauri, as evidenced by the gradual increase in starlight near the center. Using instruments at the Gemini Observatory to measure the speed of stars swirling in the cluster's core, E. Noyola and colleagues found that stars closer to the core are moving faster than stars farther away. This measurement was interpreted to mean that unseen matter at the core is interacting gravitationally with nearby stars. By comparing these results with standard models, the astronomers concluded that the most likely cause was the gravitational pull of a dense, massive object such as a black hole. They calculated the object's mass at 40,000 solar masses. However, more recent work has challenged these conclusions, in particular disputing the proposed location of the cluster center. Calculations using a revised location for the center found that the velocity of core stars does not vary with distance, as would be expected if an intermediate-mass black hole were present. The same studies also found that starlight does not increase toward the center but instead remains relatively constant. The authors noted that their results do not entirely rule out the black hole proposed by Noyola and colleagues, but they do not confirm it, and they limit its maximum mass to 12,000 solar masses.  Disrupted dwarf galaxy It has been speculated that Omega Centauri is the core of a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and absorbed by the Milky Way. Indeed, Kapteyn's Star, which is currently only 13 light years away from Earth, is thought to originate from Omega Centauri. Omega Centauri's chemistry and motion in the Milky Way are also consistent with this picture. Like Mayall II, Omega Centauri has a range of metallicities and stellar ages that suggests that it did not all form at once (as globular clusters are thought to form) and may in fact be the remainder of the core of a smaller galaxy long since incorporated into the Milky Way. In fiction The novel Singularity (2012) by Ian Douglas, presents as fact that Omega Centauri and Kapteyn's Star originate from a disrupted dwarf galaxy, and this origin is central to the novel's plot. A number of scientific aspects of Omega Centauri are discussed as the story progresses, including the likely radiation environment inside the cluster and what the sky might look like from inside the cluster. The novel Waiting for Omega (2016) by David Villa is set on a planet \\"diametrically opposite\\" Omega Centauri with respect to Earth, thereby marking the globular cluster as a pointer to humanity's distant and all but forgotten homeworld. This cluster figures in the German pulp science fiction series Perry Rhodan, and a cycle of the spinoff series Atlan is set in Omega Centauri. Omega Centauri cycle (German).

Voter turnout was only 52.1%.Dieter Nohlen, Michael Krennerich & Bernhard Thibaut (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p746 Background In early 1994 relations between the government and the presidency again began to deteriorate. In April Trovoada publicly dissociated himself from government policy. In June political tension increased when the PCD-GR accused Trovoada of systematic obstruction of the government's programme. The same month opposition parties petitioned the president to dismiss the government and to appoint foreign auditors to investigate the management of public funds under its term of office. On 2 July 1994 Trovoada dismissed the government of Prime Minister Norberto d'Alva Costa Alegre citing 'institutional conflict' as the justification for the decision. Moreover, the president accused the ruling party of ignoring presidential vetoes and of attempting to replace the semi-presidential system with a parliamentary regime without executive powers for the head of state. On 4 July Trovoada appointed Evaristo do Espirito Santo de Carvalho (the minister of defence and security in the outgoing administration) as prime minister. The PCD-GR, which refused to participate in the new government, subsequently expelled Carvalho from the party. An interim administration, comprising eight ministers, took office on 9 July. On the following day, in an attempt to resolve the political crisis, Trovoada dissolved the national assembly and announced that a legislative election would be held on 2 October.

Shield-maidens are often mentioned in sagas such as Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks and in Gesta Danorum. They also appear in stories of other Germanic peoples: Goths, Cimbri, and Marcomanni.The article Sköldmö in Nordisk familjebok (1917). The mythical Valkyries may have been based on such shield- maidens.  Historical existence  The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated. Scholars like Neil Price argue that they existed, while scholars such as Judith Jesch cite a lack of evidence for trained or regular women warriors. = Archaeology = Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted. Norse immigrant graves in England and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons. In a tie-in special to the TV series Vikings, Neil Price showed that a 10th-century Birka-burial excavated in the 1970s containing many weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström. In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female, the so-called Birka female Viking warrior, but others, including scholar of the Vikings Judith Jesch, say that conclusion is premature. = Historical accounts = There are few historical attestations that Viking Age women took part in warfare. The Byzantine historian John Skylitzes records that women fought in battle when Sviatoslav I of Kiev attacked the Byzantines in Bulgaria in 971. When the Varangians (not to be confused with the Byzantine Varangian Guard) had suffered a devastating defeat in the Siege of Dorostolon, the victors were stunned to discover armed women among the fallen warriors.Harrison, D. & Svensson, K. (2007). Vikingaliv. Fälth & Hässler, Värnamo. . p. 71 When Leif Erikson's pregnant half-sister Freydís Eiríksdóttir was in Vinland, she is reported to have taken up a sword and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking Skrælings. The fight is recounted in the Greenland saga, which does not explicitly refer to Freydís as a shield-maiden.Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) The Sagas of the Icelanders. Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained female warriors. Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the Danes at the Battle of Brávellir in the year 750: Legendary accounts Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include Brynhildr in the Vǫlsunga saga, Hervor in Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, the Brynhildr of the Bósa saga ok Herrauðs, the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar, Princess Hed in Gesta Danorum, Visna in Gesta Danorum and Veborg in Gesta Danorum. Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the Hervarar saga. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword Tyrfing from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider. She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking Huns. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield. Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles. = Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir = Brynhildr of the Vǫlsunga saga, along with her rival in love, Guðrún Gjúkadóttir, provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas. Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honour, much like a male warrior. When she ends up married to Guðrún's brother Gunnarr instead of Sigurðr, the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:Jesse L. Byock, trans., Saga of the Volsungs (University of California Press, 1990). Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) Saga of the Volsungs.University of California Press, 1990. Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family. Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, \\"Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires.\\" In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories. In popular culture Female warriors inspired by the Norse sagas are portrayed in numerous works of historical and fantasy fiction, including prominently in such works as the 2013 TV series Vikings. Explaining the inclusion of a female Viking warrior protagonist in the video game Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the game's historical advisor Thierry Noël said: \\"The archaeological sources are highly debated on that specific issue. But (...) it was part of [the Norse] conception of the world. Sagas and myths from Norse society are full of tough female characters and warriors. It was part of their idea of the world, that women and men are equally formidable in battle\\". While women warriors are a staple of fantasy fiction, they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include Éowyn in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and Thorgil in Nancy Farmer's The Sea of Trolls trilogy.

The character first appeared in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #1 (June 1992). He is a sadomasochistic and psychopathic serial killer who carves a tally mark onto himself for each of his victims. A recurring adversary of the superhero Batman, Zsasz belongs to the collective of enemies that make up Batman's rogues gallery. The character has been featured in various forms of media. Most notably, Danny Jacobs has voiced him in the Batman: Arkham video game franchise, and actor Anthony Carrigan portrayed Victor Zsasz on the live- action television series Gotham. Tim Booth portrayed Zsasz in the film Batman Begins (2005). Chris Messina portrayed Zsasz in the DC Extended Universe film Birds of Prey (2020). Publication history Zsasz first appeared in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #1 (June 1992), as part of the \\"Batman: The Last Arkham\\" four-part story arc, and his origin story was told in The Batman Chronicles #3 (December 1996); both stories were written by Alan Grant and drawn by Norm Breyfogle. As revealed in the foreword to the trade paperback form of \\"Batman: The Last Arkham\\", Zsasz's name is derived from that of psychiatrist Thomas Szasz; Grant saw the name while visiting a library.Breyfogle, N. & Grant, A. (1996). Batman: The Last Arkham. DC comics. . Fictional character biography =Origin story= In Batman Chronicles #3, told by Zsasz himself, it is learned that Victor Zsasz was the head of his own international company and had amassed a large personal fortune in addition to his family's wealth. At the age of 25, his parents died in a boating accident, sending him into a deep depression. He turned to gambling, losing money in competitions around the world. One night, he ended up in a Gotham City casino known as the Iceberg Lounge, where he gambled everything he owned and ended up losing it all to the Penguin; afterwards he saw that his life was empty, driven by desire, and there was no point to his existence. While Zsasz was attempting to commit suicide by jumping from Gotham Bridge, a homeless man tried to assault him with a knife after Zsasz refused to give him money. Instinctively grabbing the knife, Zsasz saw in the man's eyes that all life is meaningless and that nothing nor anyone matters. He then proceeded to stab the man to death as a \\"gift\\" for saving his life. From then on, he dedicated himself to \\"liberating\\" others from their pointless existence (Zsasz often refers to victims as \\"zombies\\"). He usually preys on young women, but has no qualms over whom he murders. He slits his victims' throats and leaves them in lifelike poses, adding a tally mark to himself each time. He has been declared insane and is regularly incarcerated in Arkham Asylum courtesy of Batman, breaking out on occasion to carry on killing. =Later story arcs= During his debut appearance in Batman: Shadow of the Bat's opening story arc, Batman: The Last Arkham, Zsasz bribes a contractor to include a secret passage leading out from his cell during the asylum's reconstruction under its new head, Jeremiah Arkham, who inherited the asylum from his uncle, Amadeus Arkham. Although Zsasz is restrained during the daytime when he is being treated personally by Jeremiah Arkham, he is brought back to his cell at night where he would leave the asylum through the secret passage, unbeknownst to the night guards. After murders fitting his modus operandi begin surfacing, Batman and Commissioner James Gordon fake Batman's insanity in order to get him inside the asylum and investigate Zsasz. Jeremiah Arkham is exceptionally brutal towards Batman, who had supposedly murdered a police officer; over the course of the \\"treatment\\", Zsasz had warped Jeremiah's mind and turned him into a mere henchman. Due to these continuous conversations with Jeremiah Arkham, Zsasz realises Batman is a plant and subsequently murders both the contractor and another inmate at Arkham who knows of Zsasz's ploy. Both Nightwing and Batman catch up to Zsasz when he tries to escape for the final time and put him back in Arkham. Zsasz later appears in Parts 3 and 4 of the Knightfall saga. In Part 3 of Knightfall, Zsasz takes an all-girls boarding school hostage and holds the students at knifepoint until Batman arrives, briefly leaving to kill two police officers who were sent to arrest him. Though weakened both physically and mentally due to the strain of pushing himself for so long to capture the escaped inmates, Batman fights with Zsasz and tries to ignore the lunatic's mockery. He finally snaps, after Zsasz says that they are really one and the same, and administers a savage beating.Batman #492. DC Comics.Batman #493 In part 4, Zsasz's appearance is a mere cameo, depicting him being led out of the boarding school by police and Harvey Bullock personally threatening him. During the No Man's Land storyline, Zsasz is a patient in Dr. Leslie Thompkins' field hospital for a brief while, proving to be eminently deadly even when unconscious and strapped to a stretcher when he manages to open one of the arteries of a field orderly with his fingernails. Once he wakes up, he is confronted by Dr. Thompkins, whose utter selfless charity sharply contrasts with his total emptiness; she briefly gives him pause, but is finally repelled by his profound evil.The Batman Chronicles #18 (Winter 1999). DC Comics Zsasz later appears in Detective Comics #796, where he fights Stephanie Brown in her role as Robin. He attempts to slit her throat, but is distracted by her unexpected ferocity and falls back, where he attacks and attempts to kill Batman. However, Stephanie eventually defeats him. Zsasz makes a brief appearance in Infinite Crisis #7. He is part of the Secret Society of Super Villains and is one of the many of their members sent to attack the city of Metropolis. The Society loses. Zsasz is not seen in any major villainous role again until Detective Comics #815, released in March 2006, entitled \\"Victims\\". Before a quarterly psychiatric review, Zsasz kills his guards with metal poles attached to his neck bracket and escapes to kill again. Batman hunts for Zsasz, which proves unsuccessful until Zsasz gains access to a charity event (attended by Bruce Wayne) and stabs Wayne's beloved butler, Alfred Pennyworth, in the stomach. Wayne drives Alfred to the hospital, saving his life. To lure Zsasz to him, Wayne holds a press conference in which he announces that Alfred is still alive. Having already made a scar for Alfred, Zsasz realises that his tally is off by one (Zsasz remarks: \\"My skin... it's crawling... every inch of it feels... wrong.\\") During the second part of \\"Victims\\" (Detective Comics #816), after a fight with Batman, Zsasz proceeds to the hospital to finish off Alfred. Batman catches him off-guard and knocks him unconscious, thus saving Alfred's life and sending Zsasz back to Arkham. Throughout this appearance, Cliff Chiang's artwork portrays Zsasz with visual elements commonly associated with the skinhead subculture, including work boots resembling Doc Martens, tight jeans, a white tank top, suspenders or \\"braces\\", and a close-cropped hairstyle. Additionally, Chiang's portrayal of Zsasz is more outwardly physically imposing than the gaunt, wiry physique created by Breyfogle and favored by most subsequent artists. No dialogue in the story arc references Zsasz being a skinhead nor does it explain his increased musculature, and it is likely these visual elements were the decision of the artist. Zsasz is later seen again in the Gotham Underground story arc where, in issue 3, he appears in a disguised Batman's cell at Blackgate Prison and attempts to kill him with a knife. He ends up cutting Batman's arm just as he was waking up and the resulting fight ends with Zsasz being knocked unconscious and Batman being rushed to the hospital. A naked, desperate and totally deranged Zsasz appeared in the first issue of Batman: Cacophony (2008), written by film director Kevin Smith, killing a young couple and threatening their children before Batman subdues him. His thoughts move so quickly that there are no spaces between the words. In the issue, Batman says that of all the criminals he fights, he hates Zsasz the most. In the Battle For The Cowl storyline, Zsasz is recruited by a new Black Mask into a group of villains aiming to take over Gotham. This arrangement is explained further in a continuous story arc through the Streets of Gotham series, with Black Mask hiring Zsasz after he saved the former's life following a confrontation with former employee Firefly. Black Mask presents Zsasz with a briefcase filled with cash and advises him to finally live out his dream, knowing full well any 'dream' of Zsasz's would culminate in mass murder. Apprehensive at first on how to go about this, he eventually decides to take Black Mask up on his offer, dressing in Armani suits (appearing near exactly the image of Woody Harrelson's character in Natural Born Killers) and purchasing a warehouse as his base of operations. During an investigation into the discovery of several children murdered by Humpty Dumpty, Damian Wayne is 'captured' by a man soliciting runaway kids with the promise of a free meal and a place to stay. Damian discovers the man to be a close associate of Victor Zsasz, and that Zsasz has been slowly building a financial empire using runaway children and kidnapped orphans in a 'fight to the death' arena where people bet on the winners. The winning child faces a new contestant, and so on, until the last child left fights Zsasz one-on-one, with the promise of freedom for winning (with it clearly evident none have won thus far). Having seen the horrors that Zsasz has left, as well as a haunting memory of seeing the dead bodies of children he killed, Damian questions why Bruce or Dick have allowed a man like Zsasz to be left alive, despite their moral code against murder. Damian manages to subdue Victor and attack him viciously with a sword, after which he falls into Gotham Harbor. Not wanting to defy his mentor and late father's beliefs, he promises Dick that the blow wasn't fatal since he \\"missed Zsasz's spine\\" but indicated that his survival was slim. Zsasz is later seen in captivity in Detective Comics, after Black Mask's (Jeremiah Arkham) apprehension, in Arkham Asylum. While no reference is made to Zsasz's injury (nor does he appear to be injured), his presence in Arkham alongside Jeremiah strongly suggests the events of this issue take place subsequent to the injury, meaning he did survive the attack.Detective Comics #865 (July 2010), DC Comics. =The New 52= Zsasz has appeared various times in The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe) as an inmate of Arkham,Batman #1 and he is later seen attacking Batgirl in the Narrows, while on Venom.Batman: The Dark Knight #2. DC Comics. Zsasz next appears in Detective Comics (vol. 2) #18 written by John Layman. He is released from Arkham Asylum by the Joker prior to the events of Death of the Family.

DC Comics. Powers and abilities In addition to his wiry-yet- tall physique, Zsasz is extremely agile and flexible, able to go toe-to-toe with even Batman for brief bouts. Though he favors slitting his victims' throats with knives, he has no reservations about tossing blades at opponents if the occasion calls for it, and even carries several spare knives for this purpose. Though he personally dislikes guns, considering them \\"unreliable\\", Zsasz is known to occasionally carry firearms in order to coerce his selected victims. Even barehanded, Zsasz is a formidable opponent; as he is locked away in an enormous steel containment unit for 16 hours a day, he has made a habit of practicing isometrics in the cramped space to strengthen his body. Zsasz is incredibly intelligent and is described as having \\"a brilliant criminal mind\\".The DC Comics Encyclopedia. He is constantly thinking quickly both while incarcerated and active, and some of his escapes have been a result of his cunning schemes. Zsasz is completely unpredictable, having no qualms about who he kills, when and where. Thus, he is almost impossible to track, even if signs of his modus operandi appear evident, as there is no motive or clue trail to follow. Such unpredictability also renders him a danger to anyone and everyone who may encounter him. During the Streets of Gotham story arc, it is learned that Zsasz sees the world as bathed in red, and everyone in it as a victim he has murdered. He envisions both friend (Black Mask) and foe (Dick Grayson) as having died at his hand with their throats slashed. During his battle with Damian, Zsasz begins to lose his composure when he begins to see him as a living human being rather than as a dead body. Other versions =Crimson Mist= In Batman: Crimson Mist, Zsasz is one of the inmates of Arkham Asylum whom the vampiric Batman slaughters. Batman tears Zsasz's chest open with his talons to mark the scar which will represent Zsasz' own life; he then drinks Zsasz' blood and cuts off his head.Batman: Crimson Mist. DC Comics. =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Victor Zsasz is imprisoned in the military Doom prison.Flashpoint: Legion of Doom #1 (June 2011) During the prison break, Zsasz is killed by the arsonist Heat Wave. =Batman: Arkham City= In the Batman: Arkham City prequel comic book, Zsasz was briefly mentioned by Hugo Strange as an inmate he intentionally, but anonymously released so that Tyger forces could recapture him in order to boost Arkham City's credit as a safe prison. Upon admittance, Zsasz quickly became well known as the \\"Payphone Killer\\" in Arkham City, hooking up all the old phone lines with the help of the Broker, tracking and murdering anyone unlucky enough to answer one of his calls after being briefly imprisoned by Penguin in his museum. He briefly appeared in Two-Face's trial against Joker as a juror, and also agreed to condemn Joker to death. =Injustice: Gods Among Us= Zsasz appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us comic, interrupting an argument between Superman and Batman, taunting Superman and asking him if he felt the 'release' from taking a life. Wonder Woman then has Cyborg open Zsasz's cell door, much to Batman's horror and Zsasz's delight, only for the insane killer to be quickly swept away by the Flash to the secure location Superman has created for the Arkham patients. Zsasz later appears in Year Five where he is sent by Superman to interrogate Alfred Pennyworth on the whereabouts of the ever-elusive Batman. Alfred is able to put up a fight before Zsasz kills him, not finding out where Batman is, however, as Alfred was both unaware and unwilling to help. This brings Batman out of hiding and he soon after corners Zsasz, beating him into submission. Zsasz refuses to confirm whether Superman sent him and sadistically reveals where he has placed Alfred's tally mark. Damian Wayne shows up and orders Batman to kill Zsasz, or he will do it instead. Zsasz is put back into prison, but Damian sneaks into his cell and kills Zsasz in revenge. Before dying Zsasz stated that the scar representing Alfred's death was his favorite one. In the game's sequel Injustice 2, the timeline where he was killed by Damian in Year Five has been retconned, and was instead killed earlier by Damian in Year One, in the same time Damian defects to join Superman's side. In other media =Television= *Victor Zsasz makes his live-action television debut in the Fox series Gotham, portrayed by Anthony Carrigan.

Batman manages to sneak behind Zsasz and render him unconscious. However, Zsasz later manages to get free, killing guards in their break room (positioning them for playing poker) and in the garden (where he positioned them to read books). Joker found him there and recruited him to torture Dr. Young for the TITAN formula; Batman manages to render Zsasz unconscious again, but Dr. Young's rescue is short-lived as a bomb takes her life shortly after. He is later seen in Scarecrow's final hallucinations as one of the villains escorting Batman into Arkham, similar to the guards who brought the Joker into Arkham Asylum at the start of the game. Later in the hand-to-hand combat challenge modes, Zsasz appears as an NPC that Batman must fight along with regular thugs. He carries two knives, and must be stunned to attack. * In the sequel Batman: Arkham City, Batman must track him down and foil his murders in a side mission, with Zsasz calling him on various payphones and instructing Batman to find another phone within a time limit before Victor Zsasz starts killing hostages.

Batman eventually tracks him down to his hideout by tracking the series of communication towers he uses to bounce his telephone signal, and stops him before he kills two hostages. However, Detective Mode—a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen—reveals a body in the water, suggesting a hostage unsuccessfully tried escaping or committed suicide, or Zsasz simply grew tired of waiting and killed him. Batman then puts Zsasz in a cage where he kept his prisoners. It is mentioned by Penguin that Victor Zsasz has murdered over 100 men, women, and children. It's also made apparent that he was captured by Penguin and put on display at one point, before escaping. * In Batman: Arkham Knight, Victor Zsasz makes a cameo appearance in a recording showing Oracle's kidnapping.

He is the younger nephew and heir of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and nearly as cruel, treacherous, and cunning as his uncle. Feyd is portrayed by Sting in the 1984 film Dune, and by Matt Keeslar in the 2000 miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune. Description Sixteen-year-old Feyd, the younger nephew and heir of Baron Harkonnen, is described as dark-haired, and is lean and muscular in contrast to his morbidly obese uncle. The Baron also notes that the \\"full and pouting look\\" of Feyd's lips is \\"the Harkonnen genetic marker\\". Feyd and his elder brother Glossu Rabban are the legal sons of Baron Harkonnen's youngest demibrother, Abulurd Rabban, who had \\"renounced the Harkonnen name and all rights to the title when given the subdistrict governorship of Rabban-Lankiveil\\". Appearances =Dune= As Dune begins, Feyd-Rautha figures heavily in the Baron's plans to gain power for House Harkonnen. The Baron favors the handsome and charismatic Feyd over Feyd's older brother Glossu Rabban (\\"The Beast\\") because of Feyd's intelligence and his dedication to the Harkonnen culture of carefully planned and subtly executed sadism and cruelty, as opposed to Rabban's outright brutality. Feyd is, for a while, the Baron's heir, or na-Baron. To assure Feyd's power, the Baron intends to install him as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. Feyd, like Paul Atreides, is also the product of a centuries-long breeding program organized by the Bene Gesserit, who planned their own alliance by joining a Harkonnen son to an Atreides daughter with the expectation that their offspring would have a high probability of being their hoped-for Kwisatz Haderach. For this reason, Lady Jessica's decision to defy the Sisterhood and to produce an Atreides son, Paul, threw the Bene Gesserit's plans into turmoil and established an irreconcilable tension between Feyd and Paul as the scions of their bitterly opposed noble houses. The risk of one or both of these young men being killed, destroying thousands of years of genetic engineering, is so great that the Bene Gesserit send an envoy, Margot Fenring, to seduce Feyd and conceive a child, salvaging his genetic material. Paul and Feyd duel in Dune (1984) Margot also intends to \\"plant deep in his deepest self the necessary prana-bindu phrases to bend him,\\" which she later refers to as the \\"Hypno- ligation of that Feyd-Rautha's psyche.\\" Presumably he is thus \\"prepared\\" and made vulnerable to a command which will cause complete muscle paralysis, a technique the Bene Gesserit sometimes use on individuals who are considered highly dangerous. It is also later noted by the Reverend Mother Mohiam that Feyd's encounter with Lady Fenring produced a daughter. Feyd's ambition and impatience to inherit the Baron's title and power spur him to attempt his uncle's assassination. The attempt fails, prompting the Baron to reveal to his nephew the lofty plans he has for him, possibly to even have him ascend the throne as Emperor. The Baron explains that the elevation of House Harkonnen means more to him than power in his own lifetime, so if Feyd promises to forego any further assassination attempts, he will voluntarily step down and let his nephew succeed him—after his plot against the Emperor has succeeded. Feyd agrees, but as punishment for the failed assassination attempt, the Baron forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as his lovers so that Feyd will learn the price of failure. As Paul makes his final bid to usurp the Padishah Emperor's power, he is challenged by Feyd, the current Harkonnen leader after the deaths of the Baron and Rabban. Though famed for his prowess in single combat, Feyd intends to guarantee victory by breaking the formal rules of kanly (which govern this type of challenge) and using a hidden poison spur in his fighting outfit. He nearly succeeds in killing Paul in the ritualized fight, as Paul struggles with whether to try the paralysis word-sound given to him by his mother, and owe the Bene Gesserit his victory, or to risk his life against Feyd in a \\"fair\\" fight. Paul manages to defeat Feyd without the command, and goes on to ascend the throne of the Emperor. =Prelude to Dune= In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, it is established that Feyd had been born on the Harkonnen planet Lankiveil as the second son of Vladimir's younger half- brother Abulurd Harkonnen and his wife Emmi. The Bene Gesserit, desiring a son by Abulurd for their breeding program but finding Glossu unacceptable, secretly administer fertility drugs to an aging Emmi, who soon conceives Feyd. Named after his maternal grandfather, Rautha Rabban, who had been murdered by Glossu, Feyd becomes honorable Abulurd's hope for a son who would not have to inherit the dishonor of the name Harkonnen, and a worthy heir in comparison to his older, murderous son, Glossu. The Baron decides to take the infant Feyd from his father to raise on the Harkonnen homeworld Giedi Prime as another possible heir for himself, and as punishment for Abulurd's attempts to sever all his ties to House Harkonnen. In time, the Baron comes to favor Feyd over Glossu. =Sandworms of Dune= In Sandworms of Dune (2007), the second of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's two-part finale to the original Dune series, a ghola of Paul Atreides is created over 5,000 years after the original's death. Once his memories are restored, Paul recalls that after his ascension to the Imperial throne (between the novels Dune and 1969's Dune Messiah) he \\"had not been able to escape political struggles, assassination attempts, the exiled Emperor Shaddam's bid for power and the pretender daughter of Feyd-Rautha and Lady Fenring ...\\" In adaptations Feyd is portrayed by Sting in the 1984 film Dune, and by Matt Keeslar in the 2000 miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune. Brigid Brown of BBC America called Sting a \\"scene-stealer\\" in the 1984 film. Emmet Asher-Perrin of Tor.com called Keeslar's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha \\"the strangest casting choice you've ever seen,\\" adding that \\"it's also hard not to love the strangeness of it.\\" Merchandising A line of Dune action figures from toy company LJN was released to lackluster sales in 1984. Styled after David Lynch's film, the collection featured a figure of Feyd as well as other characters.

In 1984, he also hosted an after-school children's show called The Ossie Ostrich Video Show, with co-host Jacki MacDonald. Vinyl Album cover from the 1976 comedy release Keep Smiling with Daryl and Ossie. Ossie is described as a good-natured pink ostrich that sported a light blue mohawk hairstyle.

Somers sometimes retaliated by calling Ossie names like 'Fiberglass Head', but he also had more affectionate names, like his 'pink, feathered beakie'. The comic skill of Somers and Carroll was instrumental in leading to the wider appeal of the show and its move to a prime time spot on Saturday evening. According to Hey Hey It's Saturday The Book: > Ossie Ostrich stepped out of the case and, as if under the control of a > superior being, walked to the host set and looked directly into the left eye > of Daryl Somers. \\"Well, I never!\\" said Daryl. \\"Oh you must have,\\" said > Ossie.

He did however return briefly for the second Hey Hey reunion's as a special guest. Over time, Ossie's head had to be replaced due to mishaps. Lipstick marks from over-amorous admirers were very difficult to remove. Other members of Ossie's family were represented using the same puppet with different accessories. On the Tarax Show, Ossie's theme song was \\"Here comes Ossie Ostrich\\". This was also occasionally heard on Hey Hey. Merchandising  Merchandise included a plush toy version of Ossie and a marionette puppet, as well as comic books. TV Week carried an Ossie Ostrich comic strip for a period, and these were collected in book form.

Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. The channeled scablands were scoured by more than 40 cataclysmic floods during the Last Glacial Maximum and innumerable older cataclysmic floods over the last two million years. These cataclysmic floods were repeatedly unleashed when a large glacial lake repeatedly drained and swept across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Plateau during the Pleistocene epoch. The last of the cataclysmic floods occurred between 18,200 and 14,000 years ago.Balbas, A.M., Barth, A.M., Clark, P.U., Clark, J., Caffee, M., O'Connor, J., Baker, V.R., Konrad, K. and Bjornstad, B., 2017. 10Be dating of late Pleistocene megafloods and Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreat in the northwestern United States. Geology, 45(7), pp. 583-586. Geologist J Harlen Bretz defined \\"scablands\\" in a series of papers written in the 1920s as lowlands diversified by a multiplicity of irregular channels and rock basins eroded into basalt. Flood waters eroded the loess cover, creating large anastomizing channels that exposed bare basalt and creating butte-and-basin topography. The buttes range in height from , while the rock basins range from in width up to the long and 30 m deep Rock Lake. Bretz further stated, \\"The channels run uphill and downhill, they unite and they divide, they head on the back-slopes and cut through the summit; they could not be more erratically and impossibly designed.\\" The debate on the origin of the Scablands that ensued for four decades became one of the great controversies in the history of earth science. The Scablands are also important to planetary scientists as perhaps the best terrestrial analog of the Martian outflow channels.Carr, M. H. (2006), The Surface of Mars. Cambridge Planetary Science Series, Cambridge University Press. History Bretz conducted research and published many papers during the 1920s describing the Channeled Scablands. His theories of how they were formed required short but immense floods – – for which Bretz had no explanation. Bretz's theories met with vehement opposition from geologists of the day, who tried to explain the features with uniformitarian theories. J.T. Pardee first suggested in 1925 to Bretz that the draining of a glacial lake could account for flows of the magnitude needed. Pardee continued his research over the next 30 years, collecting and analyzing evidence that eventually identified Lake Missoula as the source of the Missoula Floods and creator of the Channeled Scablands. Pardee's and Bretz's theories were accepted only after decades of painstaking work and fierce scientific debate. Research on open-channel hydraulics in the 1970s put Bretz's theories on solid scientific ground. In 1979 Bretz received the highest medal of the Geological Society of America, the Penrose Medal, to recognize that he had developed one of the great ideas in the earth sciences. Geology Distinct geomorphological features include coulees, dry falls, streamlined hills and islands of remnant loess, gravel fans and bars, and giant current ripples. The term scabland refers to an area that has experienced fluvial erosion resulting in the loss of loess and other soils, leaving the land barren.Baker (2008) River valleys formed by erosional downcutting of rivers create V-shaped valleys, while glaciers carve out U-shaped valleys. The Channeled Scablands have a rectangular cross section, with flat plateaus and steep canyon sides, and are spread over immense areas of eastern Washington. The morphology of the scablands is butte-and-basin. The area that encompasses the Scablands has been estimated between , though those estimates still may be too conservative.Foster (2011) They exhibit a unique drainage pattern that appears to have an entrance in the northeast and an exit in the southwest. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet dammed up Glacial Lake Missoula at the Purcell Trench Lobe. A series of floods occurring over the period of 18,000 to 13,000 years ago swept over the landscape when the ice dam broke. The eroded channels also show an anastomosing, or braided, appearance. The presence of Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits have been documented within the Channeled Scabland as other parts of the Columbia Basin, e.g. the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. Based on the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded with glaciofluvial flood deposits, magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes, it has been estimated that the oldest of these megafloods flowed through the Channel Scablands sometime before 1.5 million years ago. Because of the fragmentary nature of older glaciofluvial deposits, which have been largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods, the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as Ancient Cataclysmic Floods, that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence.Medley, E. (2012) Ancient Cataclysmic Floods in the Pacific Northwest: Ancestors to the Missoula Floods. Unpublished Masters thesis, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon. 174 pp.Spencer, P. K., and M. A. Jaffee (2002) Pre-Late Wisconsinan Glacial Outburst Floods in Southeastern Washington—The Indirect Record. Washington Geology. vol. 30, no. 1/2, pp. 9-16. As many as 100 separate, cataclysmic Ice Age floods may have occurred during the last glaciation.Waitt, RB, Jr. (1994) Scores of Gigantic, Successively Smaller Lake Missoula Floods Through Channeled Scabland and Columbia Valley, in Geologic Field Trips in the Pacific Northwest: 1994 Geological Society of America Meeting, Chapter 1K, D. A. Swanson and R. A. Haugerud (eds.), Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado. There have been at least 17 complete interglacial-glacial cycles since about 1.77 million years ago, and perhaps as many as 44 interglacial-glacial cycles since the beginning of the Pleistocene about 2.58 million years ago. Presuming a dozen (or more) floods were associated with each glaciation, the total number of cataclysmic Ice Age Missoula floods that flowed through the Channeled Scablands for the entire Pleistocene Epoch could possibly number in the hundreds, perhaps exceeding a thousand Ancient Cataclysmic Floods.Bjornstad, B.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Richland, Washington. There are also immense potholes and ripple marks, much larger than those found on ordinary rivers. When these features were first studied, no known theories could explain their origin. The giant current ripples are between high and are regularly spaced, relatively uniform hills. Vast volumes of flowing water would be required to produce ripple marks of this magnitude, as they are larger-scale versions of the ripple marks found on streambeds that are typically only centimeters high. Large potholes were formed by swirling vortexes of water called kolks scouring and plucking out the bedrock. The Scablands are littered with large boulders called glacial erratics that rafted on glaciers and were deposited by the glacial outburst flooding. The lithology of erratics usually does not match the rock type that surrounds it, as they are often carried very far from their origin.

It originated as a courtship dance in Guadalajara, Jalisco, during the 19th century, although its elements can be traced back to the Spanish zambra and jarabe gitano, which were popular during the times of the viceroyalty. Female dancers traditionally wear a china poblana outfit, while the male dancers dress as charros. The standard music of the jarabe tapatío was composed by Jesús González Rubio in the 19th century. However, its more common instrumental arrangement dates from the 1920s. Sometimes it is confused with La Raspa, another Mexican dance. Nowadays, its music is most commonly performed by either mariachi groups or string ensembles. History Jarabe tapatío in the traditional china poblana dress. Jarabe dancers at Cinco de Mayo celebrations in Los Angeles, 1952. The word jarabe (from Arabic xarab), originally meaning \\"herb mixture\\", denotes the combination of various Mexican musics (sones) and dances (zapateados). Tapatío, the popular demonym of the city of Guadalajara, reflects the origin of this particular jarabe. A number of other dances known as jarabes are known to have existed in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the jarabe de Jalisco, the jarabe de atole and the jarabe moreliano, but the tapatío version is by far the best known. There is some dispute as to the jarabe tapatío's authenticity as folk dance. Music researcher Nicolás Puentes Macías from Zacatecas states that true jarabes are almost extinct in Mexico, found today only in small fractions of Zacatecas and Jalisco, and that the jarabe tapatío is really a form of a dance called \\"tonadilla\\". Mexicans dancing jarabe tapatío in Guadalajara, Mexico. The earliest evidence of the dance comes from the late 18th century. It was originally danced by female couples in order to avoid the disapproval of the church. Shortly before the Mexican War of Independence, mixed couples began to perform it, with a public performance at the Coliseo Theater in 1790 in Mexico City. Shortly after that performance, the jarabe was banned by colonial and religious authorities as it was considered to be morally offensive and a challenge to Spain's control over the territory. However, this only served to make the dance more popular as a form of protest and rebellion, with people holding illegal dances in public squares and neighborhood festivals. Just after Independence, the jarabe and other dances grew and spread in popularity even more, with colonial-era restrictions lifted. People celebrated the end of the war in 1821 with large fiestas, which prominently featured the jarabe. Jarabe and other folk dances came to be seen as part of Mexico's emerging identity as a country. The jarabe would maintain various regional forms, but that associated with Guadalajara gained national status, becoming not only popular in that city but also in Mexico City as well, as a dance for the elite around the 1860s. Around the same time, Guadalajara music professor Jesús González Rubio composed a standard melody for it as a symbol of national unity, leading the dance to become the \\"national dance\\" of Mexico and the melody to gain wide popular recognition. By the Mexican Revolution, it had become popular with the lower classes as well. It became internationally famous after Russian dancer Anna Pavlova added it to her permanent repertoire after visiting Mexico in 1919. The jarabe remained in vogue in Mexico until about 1930, especially in Mexico City. It remains taught in nearly every grade school in Mexico. Performance Folkloric Ballet Aztlan performing Jarabe Tapatio. Jarabe dancers at Yale University The dance represents the courtship of a man and a woman, with the woman first rejecting the man's advances, then eventually accepting them. It has a definite sexual component in metaphor, which was the original reason for disapproval by authorities. As the dance has lost its controversial status and gained status as a representative of Mexico, the dancers have come to wear garb that is also highly representative of Mexican women and men. For women, the most traditional outfit is called the \\"China Poblana.\\" The blouse and skirt combination is named after a woman from India who came to Mexico on the Manila Galleon to work as a servant in the early 19th century. Her Asian dress was copied and then adapted in the State of Puebla, with the skirt now heavily embroidered and otherwise decorated with patriotic images. The traditional outfit for men is that of the charro, generally heavily decorated in silver trim. The music played to accompany the dance was written to be danced to and its played either by mariachi bands or by bands playing only string instruments such as various types of guitars, harps and violin. Contemporary adaptations El jarabe tapatío starts the dance by dancing around a sombrero. The popularity of the composition by Jesús González Rubio has led it to be used in many forms of media. For example, in The Simpsons TV series it is used to reference the Bumblebee Man, a stereotypical Mexican character. In the United Kingdom, the tune was used in adverts for Morrisons, primarily in the 1980s and 1990s, and some adverts in the mid-2000s. The supermarket's slogan and jingle at that time, 'More reasons to shop at Morrisons', had its tune derived from the jarabe's melody, which was used in all adverts in these eras. A jarabe also appears in Aaron Copland's ballet Billy the Kid, played in time, the tune on a solo trumpet (with orchestral accompaniment).

It was commissioned in 1296 by King Edward I to contain the coronation stone of Scotland—known as the Stone of Destiny—which had been captured from the Scots who kept it at Scone Abbey. The chair was named after Edward the Confessor, and was previously kept in his shrine at Westminster Abbey. History The Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey, 1859 The high-backed, Gothic-style armchair was carved from oak at some point between the summer of 1297 and March 1300 by the carpenter Walter of Durham. At first, the king ordered for the chair to be made of bronze, but he changed his mind and decided it should be made of timber. The chair is the oldest dated piece of English furniture made by a known artist. Since the 14th century, all crowned English and British monarchs have been seated in this chair at the moment of coronation,Rodwell, p. 324.Kings Edward V and Edward VIII, who acceded to the throne in 1483 and 1936 respectively, were never crowned with the exception of Queen Mary II, who was crowned on a copy of the chair.Rodwell, p. 161. Monarchs used to sit on the Stone of Scone itself until a wooden platform was added in the 17th century. Gilded lions added in the 16th century form the legs to the chair; they were all replaced in 1727. One of the four lions was given a new head for the coronation of George IV in 1821. The chair itself was originally gilded, painted and inlaid with glass mosaics, traces of which are visible upon inspection of the chair, especially on the back where outlines of foliage, birds and animals have managed to survive. A lost image of a king, maybe Edward the Confessor or Edward I, with his feet resting on a lion was also painted on the back. Today, its appearance is of aged and brittle wood. In the 18th century, tourists could sit on the chair for a small payment to one of the vergers.Rodwell, p. 328. Early tourists and choirboys of the abbey carved their initials and other graffiti into the chair, and the corner posts have been acutely damaged by souvenir hunters.Rodwell, p. 184–185. Sir Gilbert Scott, the Gothic revival architect and antiquary, described the chair as \\"a magnificent piece of decoration, but sadly mutilated\\". At 5:40 pm on 11 June 1914, the chair was the object of a bomb attack thought to have been organised by the Suffragettes. A corner of the chair was broken off in the explosion. Although it was strong enough to shake the abbey walls and loud enough to be heard from inside the Houses of Parliament, none of the 70 people in the abbey at the time were injured, and the Coronation Chair was faithfully restored. Over the eight centuries of its existence the chair has only been removed from Westminster Abbey twice. The first time was for the ceremony in Westminster Hall when Oliver Cromwell was inducted as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, and the second during the Second World War when it was moved to Gloucester Cathedral for the duration of the war. On Christmas Day 1950, Scottish Nationalists broke into the abbey and removed the Stone of Scone. It was recovered in time for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. In 1996 the stone was returned to Scotland, where it is kept at Edinburgh Castle on the proviso that it be returned to England for use at coronations. The Coronation Chair is highly protected, and leaves its secure location—on a plinth in St George's Chapel in the nave—only when it is carried into the theatre of coronation near the High Altar of the abbey. Between 2010 and 2012, the chair was cleaned and restored by a team of experts in full view of the public at the abbey.Rodwell, p. 317. Other chairs used at the coronation The Coronation Chair (centre right) and the throne (lower centre) at the Coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. Other chairs are also used throughout the coronation ceremony. Chairs of Estate for the sovereign and consort are placed on the south side of the sanctuary, and these are used during the first part of the liturgy, prior to the sovereign's anointing and crowning with St Edward's Crown. Then, for a part of the service called the enthronement, and for the homage which follows it, the monarch is placed not in the Coronation Chair, but in a throne on a dais in the middle of the transept. On occasions when the wife of a king—a queen consort—is crowned, a similar throne is provided for her so that she can be seated next to the king but at a lower level. Unlike the Coronation Chair, these other chairs and thrones tend to be made new for each coronation. Afterwards, they have often been placed in the Throne Rooms of royal palaces. The Chair of Estate from the 1953 coronation can be found in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace, along with those of George VI and his consort Queen Elizabeth. The 1953 throne is kept in the Garter Throne Room of Windsor Castle; the thrones of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra are in the Ballroom at Buckingham Palace. Those of George V and Queen Mary may be seen in the Throne Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.

Elvira Madigan is today known for her relationship with the Swedish nobleman and cavalry officer . Their joint death caused great sensation and the event was described in song by among others the author in a song beginning \\"Sad things happen\\", which gained great popularity. Nordisk familjebok, 1951-1955 year edition Early life The poster from Elvira Madigan's debut as a slack line dancer in St. Petersburg on April 23, 1879. Elvira Madigan is often said to be Danish, but uncertainty still prevails over which should be considered her home country and about her citizenship. Her mother was a circus artist born in Finland but of Norwegian ancestry, Eleonora Cecilie Christine Marie Olsen. She was later known as Laura Madigan (1849–1918) but during Elvira's childhood she mostly used the stage name Miss Ulbinska. The father was circus artist Frederik Peter Jensen, born in 1845 in Copenhagen. His later destiny is unknown. At the time of Elvira Madigan's birth, her parents were not married to each other, and they toured with the French circus director Didier Gautier's \\"Cirque du Nord\\" in Germany and Denmark. During the years 1869–1872 Elvira's mother toured with Circus Renz in Germany and Austria, where she in 1871 gave birth to Elvira's half-brother Richard Heinrich Olsen in Berlin. He later toured with the stage name Oscar Madigan. The father of this child is unknown. In 1875, Elvira's mother worked at Circus Myers in Austria,Znaimer Wochenblatt 1875-06-26 where she got to know the American circus artist John Madigan, whom she subsequently lived with. The following year Elvira Madigan, then still Hedvig Jensen, made her debut in the circus, when she rode a pas- de-deux with John Madigan during a performance with the circus Loisset in Tivoli in Copenhagen . After the death of Loisset in Norrköping the following year, his circus was dissolved, and the Madigan family moved to Circus Ciniselli in Russia. There Elvira Madigan trained to be a slack line dancer. =Career = In the summer of 1879, the Madigan family tried to run their own small circus company in Finland and at the same time Hedvig began using the name Elvira Madigan. The following year, when the family appeared in Circus Cremes in Vienna, Gisela Brož became a foster child in the family, she was two years older than Elvira. Gisela was trained as a tightrope dancer, and together with Elvira on slack line they practiced a unique number, where they appeared simultaneously on separate lines, one above the other. Elvira used to juggle at the same time as she was on the line. The number became a sensation, and in the following years the girls appeared as \\"daughters of the air\\" in circuses and in variety rooms across much of Europe, including in Berlin, Paris, London, Brussels and Moscow. After an appearance at Tivoli in Copenhagen in 1886 before the Danish royal family, the girls were each awarded a gold cross by king Kristian IX. The following year, John Madigan again started his own circus company, this time in Denmark. Gisela left the family in the autumn of the same year, after which Elvira had to appear alone when the tour continued to Sweden.  Relationship with Sixten Sparre  In January 1888 circus Madigan appeared in Kristianstad, where Elvira was seen by the dragoon lieutenant Sixten Sparre. = Letter exchange = Sixten Sparre, who was married and had two children, fell madly in love with Elvira, who was considered an extraordinary beauty, with an excellent figure and almost meter- long, blond hair. Sparre sought her out, and the two started a correspondence. Elvira gradually tired of his writing, and several times tried to end their correspondence. Sparre, however, tried to persuade her to leave both her family and the circus to marry him. According to a letter that Elvira's mother later wrote to the Danish newspaper Politiken, Sparre threatened to shoot himself if Elvira did not do as he wanted. He also lied about being divorced from his wife and misled Elvira into believing that he was well off, when in fact he had squandered his entire fortune and was heavily in debt. After a nervous breakdown, Elvira finally gave in, and on May 28, 1889, she secretly left her family at the circus's stop in Sundsvall. The family did not know about Elvira's correspondence with Sparre. = Relationship development = Sparre, who was granted two months leave from May 27, met Elvira in Bollnäs. The two went on to Stockholm, where Elvira's mother made a failed attempt to catch the couple by taking a steamboat from Sundsvall. After a few weeks in an unknown place, they arrived at Svendborg on Funen on June 18. They lived almost a month at the city hotel, but when the hotel director presented a bill, the couple fled. The already heavily indebted Sparre was completely broke at this point, and he and Elvira had obviously lived on credit for several weeks. The two lived a few days in a guest house in Troense on Tåsinge. On July 18, they went to the forest area Nørreskov, where Sixten first shot Elvira and then himself on the morning of July 19, 1889. The bodies were only found three days later. In Elvira's dress pocket was found a paper with a poem, which she had written herself just before Sparre killed her with his service revolver. The poem was written in a mixture of Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and German. Interpreted to modern English, it reads: A drop fell into the water, faded out slowly. And the place where it fell surrounded from wave to wave. What was it that fell? and where did it come from? It was but a life, and but a death that came to win itself a track. \\\\- - - † Now the water rests once again. : Hedvig = Funeral = Elvira Madigan and Sixten Sparre's burial ground at Landet cemetery after the transformation in 2013. The couple was buried at Landet's cemetery in the middle of Tåsinge on July 27 in the presence of a large number of locals and summer guests. The hotel bills, funeral costs and tombstones were paid by Sparre's brother Edvard. Elvira's grandmother came to oversee the funeral, but she did not arrive in time. The original tombstones are of two different materials, Elvira's are of white marble and Sixten's of dark gray granite. The difference was to mark that the two were not a \\"genuine\\" couple. The original burial ground is located a few meters south of the great oak in the middle of the cemetery, but during a reorganization of the cemetery walkways in 1943, the gravestones were moved a few meters to the southeast and turned to the west. The original gravestones were replaced by new ones on the 75th anniversary in 1964. At Elvira's new gravestone, her artist name was also mentioned. In 1999, the original tombstones were restored and re-used, but now turned east, while the stones were moved a few meters eastwards. In 2013, the memorial site was redesigned again and the tombstones were placed close to each other in the middle of a circular pavement, located near the 1999 memorial site.http://www.elvira- madigan.dk/Gravsted/  Remembrance, re-evaluation of love story  The interpretation of the murder drama that was told was a love story and became to many a symbol of romantic love. It was about a circus princess who was courted by a nobleman, in a combination of morality and entertainment. The event, in its turn, brought a tremendous look, and promptly gave rise to poetry and poems. Saxon's broadside ballad was heard throughout the Nordic countries from the autumn of 1889 and for many decades to come. Everyone knew the story, and everyone could sing the song. But it was not just Barrel organists that conveyed the story, also the newspapers were full of up-to-date descriptions, even with terrible details.Sveriges radio, 19 januari 2015 The couple's relationship also gave rise to an intense press debate. The conservative press condemned the couple's actions and Sparre's adultery, while the liberal press was more understanding. The event was interpreted as saying that the couple had to take this step because of the class society of the time and the prevailing sexual morality. Among other things, the Danish author Holger Drachmann wrote the tribute poem \\"Til de to\\" (To the two) under these premises. The event was seen as a repetition of the Mayerling incident, but the extent to which the two were influenced by this event is unclear. Already in the first press releases on the drama, this connection to the event in Austria was made six months earlier, and other newspapers continued to spin on this thread, perhaps mostly because this version was what the readers wanted: the all-consuming love, stronger than death, in addition, between a man of noble birth and a woman of very humble lineage (circus performers stood very low on the social scale). This romanticized view of the drama has survived to the present day through movies, novels, musicals and much more. However, recent years of research give a different picture. It has emerged that Sparre the last few years of his life lived very extravagantly. He had wasted his fortune and systematically withdrew debts in a way that gave rise to questions about his mental health. According to Grönqvist, he may have suffered from bipolar disorder, and his systematic waste, his renunciation of the family and the values his social class traditionally represented (Sparre posed far left politically in the last few years), and finally the love affair with a circus girl should then be seen as the rash of his illness. Lindhe is also condemning in his biography of Sparre's wife Luitgard, but rather sees Sixten as just spoiled, wasteful and narcissistic. In light of these findings, Sparre's deal with Elvira Madigan appears rather as a classic example of seduction of a basically unwilling girl, whose feelings for Sparre in that case were ambivalent. If Laura Madigan's letter to Politiken is considered a reliable source (it is in and of itself a party statement), Sparre forced himself on Elvira via daily love letters, filled with lies about his financial position and his non-existent divorce. Elvira also reacted with a nervous breakdown. When she finally left her family for Sparre, it seems she hoped to marry him and thereby dispel his suicidal thoughts. There is no evidence of Elvira being suicidal; that rather Sparre was driving the suicide decision might be indicated by the content of that poem, \\"The bridal bouquet\\", he dedicated to Elvira. Elvira's innermost feelings for Sixten, for obvious reasons, are unknown, but that she would have been deeply in love with him and wanted to die with her Sixten belongs to the romanticized image and has hardly any support in the primary sources. Elvira Madigan seems to have been shy and withdrawn privately, not the least seductive, despite her favorable appearance and widespread popularity. She was perceived by the time as a dispassionate and a hard flirt (as opposed to the extrovert Gisela), which certainly contributed to her affair with Sixten Sparre raising such a commotion. Elvira supposedly was interested in poetry and literature, and had supposedly been a good amateur pianist. Her mother is alleged to have been overprotective and did not even let her daughter speak to foreign men, but if this had any significance for the course of events is questionable.  Elvira Madigan in culture  In 1943, Åke Ohberg directed the first Swedish film version of Elvira Madigan with Eva Henning and himself in the lead roles. After pressure from relatives of Sixten Sparre, his name was changed to Christian. In 1967, Bo Widerberg made his film adaptation, Elvira Madigan, with Pia Degermark and Thommy Berggren in the lead roles. The film music used throughout was the second movement from Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major (K. 467) which has since been known as \\"Elvira Madigan\\". The same year, Poul Erik Møller Pedersen also directed a Danish film, with Anne Mette Michaelsen in the title role as Elvira Madigan. In 1990, the \\"Circus Elvira Madigan\\" by Jan Wirén and Lars-Åke von Vultée premiered in connection with that year's edition of the Kristianstad Days. Directed by Hasse Alfredson and among others Johan Ulveson was in the cast. In 1992, the musical Elvira Madigan premiered at Malmö City Theatre, the music was by Nick Bicât and the lead role was played by Kirsti Torhaug. The drama has also been portrayed in several theatre plays, ballets, student speaks, songs and much more. In 2019, a new Elvira Madigan musical was produced in Stockholm, with music by Mette Herlitz to a libretto by Emma Sandanam. A Swedish metal band has also taken the name Elvira Madigan. https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Elvira_Madigan/7436 The road on which the country church is located was named Elvira Madigans Vej in 1970, and she has also been given the name of a ship, a series of ornaments and much more. Sixten has got a street named after him in the regiment area of Ystad, Sixten Sparres Gata.

Early life Waterston's father, George, was an Edinburgh sealing wax manufacturer and stationer, a relative of the Sandeman family Robert and his brother, George. John was born, the sixth of nine children, into a family alive with interests in literature, science and music. He was educated at Edinburgh High School before becoming apprenticed as a civil engineer to Messrs. Grainger and Miller. His employers encouraged him to attend lectures at the University of Edinburgh. He studied mathematics and physics under Sir John Leslie as well as attending lectures in chemistry, anatomy and surgery and becoming an active participant in the student literary society. At age nineteen, Waterston published a paper proposing a mechanical explanation of gravitation, accounting for action at a distance in terms of colliding particles and discussing interactions between linear and rotational motion that would play a part in his later kinetic theory. Waterston moved to London at age twenty-one, where he worked as a railroad surveyor, becoming an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers and publishing a paper on a graphical method for planning earthworks. The travel and disruption associated with his surveying work left Waterston little time to pursue his studies so he joined the hydrography department of the Admiralty under Francis Beaufort. It was Beaufort who, in 1839, supported Waterston for the post of naval instructor for cadets of the East India Company in Bombay. The posting worked well for Waterston who was able to pursue his reading and research at the library of Grant College. Kinetic theory While in India, he first developed his kinetic theory, independently of earlier and equally neglected partial accounts by Daniel Bernoulli and John Herapath. He published it, at his own expense, in his book Thoughts on the Mental Functions (1843). He correctly derived all the consequences of the premise that gas pressure is a function of the number of molecules per unit volume, N; molecular mass, M; and molecular mean-squared velocity, \\\\bar{v^2}. He established the relationship: :P=NM\\\\bar{v^2}. He had been motivated to think of a wave theory of heat by analogy with the wave theory of light and some experiments by James Forbes and Macedonio Melloni on radiant heat. His statement that ... in mixed media the mean square molecular velocity is inversely proportional to the specific weight of the molecules has been seen as the first statement of the equipartition theorem for translational motion. Waterston grasped that, while the kinetic energy of an individual molecule with velocity v is ½mv², heat energy is proportional to temperature, T. That insight led him to derive the ideal gas law: :\\\\frac {PV} {T} = \\\\mbox{a constant}. The publication made little impact, perhaps because of the title. He submitted his theory, under Beaufort's sponsorship, to the Royal Society in 1845 but was rejected. Referee Sir John William Lubbock wrote The paper is nothing but nonsense. Unable to retrieve a copy of his paper (he had failed to make a copy for himself before submitting the paper to the Royal Society), he rewrote the work and sought to advertise it elsewhere, attracting little attention other than from William John Macquorn Rankine and Hermann von Helmholtz through whom it may have influenced August Krönig. The theory gained acceptance only when it was proposed by Rudolf Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell in the 1850s by which time Waterston's contribution had been forgotten. Later life He returned to Edinburgh in 1857 to pursue his own novel physical ideas but met with unyielding neglect and discouragement from the scientific establishment. Neglect was exacerbated by his own increasing reclusiveness and hostility to the learned societies. He worked on acoustics, astronomy, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. He left his Edinburgh home on 18 June and drowned in a nearby canal, possibly falling into the canal due to heat stress from his astronomical observation activities. Recognition after death As discussed above, Waterston's paper submitted to the Royal Society was rejected. Some years after Waterston's death, Lord Rayleigh (Secretary of Royal Society at that time) managed to dig it out from the archives of the Royal Society. Finally, Waterston's paper was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1892. (Please see below.) Rayleigh felt that Waterston's case was not an aberration, but the norm: > \\"The history of [Waterston's] paper suggests that highly speculative > investigations, especially by an unknown author, are best brought before the > world through some other channel than a scientific society, which naturally > hesitates to admit into its printed records matter of uncertain value. > Perhaps one may go further, and say that a young author who believes himself > capable of great things would usually do well to secure favourable > recognition of the scientific world by work whose scope is limited, and > whose value is easily judged, before embarking upon higher flights.\\" See also *John Herapath, another contemporaneous English physicist who also worked on the kinetic theory, and whose work was also neglected at the time References Bibliography *J.J.

Role of the EU = Direct = The European Union has a very limited direct role in sport. The European Commission is composed of Directorates-General and several departments. Within the Directorate-General Education and Culture, is the Sport Unit, which is responsible for the following main areas: * cooperation within the commission and with other institutions on sport-related issues, * cooperation with national and international sports institutions, organisations and federations, * bilateral meetings with sports institutions and organisations and international sports federations. One of the few specific measures in Sports was taken by Decision No. 291/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 February 2003 that established the European Year of Education through Sport 2004. The activities and initiatives undertaken during 2004 were organised at Community, transnational, national, regional and local level, and was sometimes co-financed by the Community. Activities compromised for instance financial support for transnational, national, regional or local initiatives to promote education through sport. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the EU role in sports is limited, because Article 165(4) states that the EU objectives in sports are restricted to measures \\"excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States\\".https://www.icsspe.org/system/files/EU%20-%20Lisbon%20Treaty%20%28Art%20165%29.pdf As such, the EU can not adopt legislation or any other legally binding measures, instead it acts through guidelines, recommendations, and funding, in order to support its sport-related objectives.https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2019)640168 =Indirect= Although not directed specifically at sport, many of the rules, policies and programmes of the European Union affect the sports world or are of interest to it. In particular, the common market of the European Union creates the right for any EU citizen to move and work freely in another member state. The landmark Bosman ruling confirmed that this right, when applied to professional athletes, forbids nationality quotas in sports leagues that affect EU citizens. This has changed the face of professional sports in the EU, with top teams now collecting talent from all over Europe, and sometimes even fielding teams with no domestic players at all.

They influenced the types of film produced, their production and marketing, and the way major studios approached film- making. In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role. The definition of New Hollywood varies, depending on the author, with some defining it as a movement and others as a period. The span of the period is also a subject of debate, as well as its integrity, as some authors, such as Thomas Schatz, argue that the New Hollywood consists of several different movements. The films made in this movement are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from classical norms. After the demise of the studio system and the rise of television, the commercial success of films was diminished. Successful films of the early New Hollywood era include Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, Night of the Living Dead, The Wild Bunch, and Easy Rider, while films that failed at the box office including Heaven's Gate and One from the Heart marked the end of the era (despite the two maintaining a cult following years later). History = Background = Following the Paramount Case (which ended block booking and ownership of theater chains by film studios) and the advent of television, both of which severely weakened the traditional studio system, Hollywood studios initially used spectacle to retain profitability. Technicolor developed a far more widespread use, while widescreen processes and technical improvements, such as CinemaScope, stereo sound and others, such as 3-D, were invented in order to retain the dwindling audience and compete with television. However, these were generally unsuccessful in increasing profits.David E James, Allegories of Cinema, American film in the Sixties, Princeton University Press, New York, 1989, pp. 14–26 By 1957, Life magazine called the 1950s \\"the horrible decade\\" for Hollywood. The 1950s and early 1960s saw a Hollywood dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films that benefited from the larger screens, wider framing and improved sound. Hence, as early as 1957, the era was dubbed a \\"New Hollywood\\". However, audience shares continued to dwindle, and had reached alarmingly low levels by the mid-1960s. Several costly flops, including Tora! Tora! Tora! and Hello, Dolly!, and failed attempts to replicate the success of The Sound of Music, put great strain on the studios. By the time the baby boomer generation was coming of age in the 1960s, \\"Old Hollywood\\" was rapidly losing money; the studios were unsure how to react to the much changed audience demographics. The change in market during the period went from a middle-aged high school-educated audience in the mid 1960s, to a younger, more affluent, college-educated demographic: by the mid 1970s, 76% of all movie-goers were under 30, 64% of whom had gone to college. European films, both arthouse and commercial (especially the Commedia all'italiana, the French New Wave, the Spaghetti Western), and Japanese cinema were making a splash in United States — the huge market of disaffected youth seemed to find relevance and artistic meaning in movies like Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup, with its oblique narrative structure and full-frontal female nudity.David A Cook, \\"Auteur Cinema and the film generation in 70s Hollywood\\", in The New American Cinema by Jon Lewis (ed), Duke University Press, New York, 1998, pp. 1–4Stefan Kanfer, The Shock of Freedom in Films, Time Magazine, Dec 8, 1967, Accessed 25 April 2009, The desperation felt by studios during this period of economic downturn, and after the losses from expensive movie flops, led to innovation and risk-taking, allowing greater control by younger directors and producers. Therefore, in an attempt to capture that audience which found a connection to the \\"art films\\" of Europe, the studios hired a host of young filmmakers (some of whom were mentored by Roger Corman) and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. This, together with the breakdown of the Production Code in 1966 and the new ratings system in 1968 (reflecting growing market segmentation) set the scene for New Hollywood. =Bonnie and Clyde= A defining film of the New Hollywood generation was Bonnie and Clyde (1967). Produced by and starring Warren Beatty and directed by Arthur Penn, its combination of graphic violence and humor, as well as its theme of glamorous disaffected youth, was a hit with audiences. The film won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Estelle Parsons)Estelle Parsons winning Best Supporting Actress-Oscars on YouTube and Best Cinematography.Burnett Guffey winning the Oscar® for cinematography for \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\"-Oscars on YouTube1968Oscars.org When Jack L. Warner, then- CEO of Warner Bros., first saw a rough cut of Bonnie and Clyde in the summer of 1967, he hated it. Distribution executives at Warner Brothers agreed, giving the film a low-key premiere and limited release. Their strategy appeared justified when Bosley Crowther, middlebrow film critic at The New York Times, gave the movie a scathing review. \\"It is a cheap piece of bald- faced slapstick comedy,\\" he wrote, \\"that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cut-ups in Thoroughly Modern Millie...\\" Other notices, including those from Time and Newsweek magazines, were equally dismissive.NewWaveFilm.com, \\"New Hollywood\\" article, March 2013 Its portrayal of violence and ambiguity in regard to moral values, and its startling ending, divided critics. Following one of the negative reviews, Time magazine received letters from fans of the movie, and according to journalist Peter Biskind, the impact of critic Pauline Kael in her positive review of the film (October 1967, New Yorker) led other reviewers to follow her lead and re-evaluate the film (notably Newsweek and Time). Kael drew attention to the innocence of the characters in the film and the artistic merit of the contrast of that with the violence in the film: \\"In a sense, it is the absence of sadism — it is the violence without sadism — that throws the audience off balance at Bonnie and Clyde. The brutality that comes out of this innocence is far more shocking than the calculated brutalities of mean killers.\\" Kael also noted the reaction of audiences to the violent climax of the movie, and the potential to empathise with the gang of criminals in terms of their naiveté and innocence reflecting a change in expectations of American cinema.Pauline Kael, \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" in, Pauline Kael, For Keeps (Plume, New York, 1994) pp. 141–57. Originally published in The New Yorker, October 21, 1967 The cover story in Time magazine in December 1967, celebrated the movie and innovation in American New Wave cinema. This influential article by Stefan Kanfer claimed that Bonnie and Clyde represented a \\"New Cinema\\" through its blurred genre lines, and disregard for honoured aspects of plot and motivation, and that \\"In both conception and execution, Bonnie and Clyde is a watershed picture, the kind that signals a new style, a new trend.\\" Biskind states that this review and turnaround by some critics allowed the film to be re-released, thus proving its commercial success and reflecting the move to New Hollywood. The impact of this film is important in understanding the rest of the American New Wave, as well as the conditions that were necessary for it. These initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to these innovative young filmmakers. In the mid-1970s, idiosyncratic, startling original films such as Paper Moon, Dog Day Afternoon, Chinatown, and Taxi Driver among others, enjoyed enormous critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of New Hollywood led each of them in turn to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.  Characteristics  This new generation of Hollywood filmmaker was most importantly, from the point of view of the studios, young, therefore able to reach the youth audience they were losing. This group of young filmmakers—actors, writers and directors—dubbed the \\"New Hollywood\\" by the press, briefly changed the business from the producer-driven Hollywood system of the past. Todd Berliner has written about the period's unusual narrative practices. The 1970s, Berliner says, marks Hollywood's most significant formal transformation since the conversion to sound film and is the defining period separating the storytelling modes of the studio era and contemporary Hollywood. New Hollywood films deviate from classical narrative norms more than Hollywood films from any other era or movement. Their narrative and stylistic devices threaten to derail an otherwise straightforward narration. Berliner argues that five principles govern the narrative strategies characteristic of Hollywood films of the 1970s: * Seventies films show a perverse tendency to integrate, in narrative incidental ways, story information and stylistic devices counterproductive to the films' overt and essential narrative purposes. * Hollywood filmmakers of the 1970s often situate their film-making practices in between those of classical Hollywood and those of European and Asian art cinema. * Seventies films prompt spectator responses more uncertain and discomforting than those of more typical Hollywood cinema. * Seventies narratives place an uncommon emphasis on irresolution, particularly at the moment of climax or in epilogues, when more conventional Hollywood movies busy themselves tying up loose ends. * Seventies cinema hinders narrative linearity and momentum and scuttles its potential to generate suspense and excitement. Thomas Schatz points to another difference with the Hollywood Golden Age, which deals with the relationship of characters and plot. He argues that plot in classical Hollywood films (and some of the earlier New Hollywood films like The Godfather) \\"tended to emerge more organically as a function of the drives, desires, motivations, and goals of the central characters\\". However, beginning with mid-1970s, he points to a trend that \\"characters became plot functions\\". During the height of the studio system, films were made almost exclusively on set in isolated studios. The content of films was limited by the Motion Picture Production Code, and though golden-age film-makers found loopholes in its rules, the discussion of more taboo content through film was effectively prevented. The shift towards a \\"new realism\\" was made possible when the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system was introduced and location shooting was becoming more viable. Because of breakthroughs in film technology (e.g. the Panavision Panaflex camera, introduced in 1972), the New Hollywood filmmakers could shoot 35mm camera film in exteriors with relative ease. Since location shooting was cheaper (no sets need to be built) New Hollywood filmmakers rapidly developed the taste for location shooting, resulting in more naturalistic approach to filmmaking, especially when compared to the mostly stylized approach of classical Hollywood musicals and spectacles made to compete with television during the 1950s and early 1960s. However, in editing New Hollywood filmmakers adhered to realism more liberally than most of their classical Hollywood predecessors, often using editing for artistic purposes rather than for continuity alone, a practice inspired by European art films and classical Hollywood directors such as D. W. Griffith and Alfred Hitchcock. Films with unorthodox editing included Easy Rider's use of editing to foreshadow the climax of the movie, as well as subtler uses, such as editing to reflect the feeling of frustration in Bonnie and Clyde and the subjectivity of the protagonist in The Graduate. The end of the production code enabled New Hollywood films to feature anti-establishment political themes, the use of rock music, and sexual freedom deemed \\"counter-cultural\\" by the studios. The youth movement of the 1960s turned anti-heroes like Bonnie and Clyde and Cool Hand Luke into pop culture idols, and Life magazine called the characters in Easy Rider \\"part of the fundamental myth central to the counterculture of the late 1960s.\\" Easy Rider also affected the way studios looked to reach the youth market. The success of Midnight Cowboy, in spite of its X rating, was evidence for the interest in controversial themes at the time and also showed the weakness of the rating system and segmentation of the audience. Interpretations on defining the movement For Peter Biskind, the new wave was foreshadowed by Bonnie and Clyde and began in earnest with Easy Rider. Biskind's book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls argues that the New Hollywood movement marked a significant shift towards independently produced and innovative works by a new wave of directors, but that this shift began to reverse itself when the commercial success of Jaws and Star Wars led to the realization by studios of the importance of blockbusters, advertising and control over production. Writing in 1968, critic Pauline Kael argued that the importance of The Graduate was in its social significance in relation to a new young audience, and the role of mass media, rather than any artistic aspects. Kael argued that college students identifying with The Graduate were not too different from audiences identifying with characters in dramas of the previous decade.Pauline Kael, \\"Trash, Art, and the Movies\\" in Going Steady, Film Writings 1968–69, Marion Boyers, New York, 1994, pp. 125–7 John Belton points to the changing demographic to even younger, more conservative audiences in the mid 1970s (50% aged 12–20) and the move to less politically subversive themes in mainstream cinema as did Thomas Schatz who saw the mid to late 1970s as the decline of the art cinema movement as a significant industry force with its peak in 1974–75 with Nashville and Chinatown. Geoff King sees the period as an interim movement in American cinema where a conjunction of forces led to a measure of freedom in filmmaking while Todd Berliner says that Seventies cinema resists the efficiency and harmony that normally characterize classical Hollywood cinema and tests the limits of Hollywood's classical model. According to author and film critic Charles Taylor (Opening Wednesday at a Theater or Drive-In Near You), he stated that \\"the 1970s remain the third — and, to date, last — great period in American movies\\".Book Review: 'Opening Wednesday At A Theater Or Drive-In Near You,' By Charles Taylor: NPR Criticism New Hollywood was not without criticism as in a Los Angeles Times article, film critic Manohla Dargis described it as the \\"halcyon age\\" of the decade's filmmaking that \\"was less revolution than business as usual, with rebel hype\\". She also pointed out in her NY Times article, its enthusiasts insisting this was \\"when American movies grew up (or at least starred underdressed actresses); when directors did what they wanted (or at least were transformed into brands); when creativity ruled (or at least ran gloriously amok, albeit often on the studio's dime).\\" This era of American cinema was also criticized for its excessive decadence.Decade of decadence: Nicholson, Polanski and Hollywood in the SeventiesThe Independent Legacy The films of Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola influenced both the Poliziotteschi genre films in Italy Violent Italy: A Poliziotteschi PrimerBirth.movies.Death. and a decade later the Cinéma du look movement in France.10 Essential Films For An Introduction To Cinema du Look – Taste of Cinema List of selected important and notable figures of the movement =Actors= * Woody Allen * René Auberjonois * Ned Beatty * Candice Bergen * Karen Black * Timothy Bottoms * Peter Boyle * Beau Bridges * Jeff Bridges * Mel BrooksWhy 1974 Was Mel Brooks's Best YearBest Movies by Farr * Geneviève Bujold * Ellen Burstyn * James Caan * Dyan Cannon * Keith Carradine * John Cassavetes * John Cazale * Julie Christie * Jill Clayburgh * Sean Connery * Bud Cort * Jamie Lee Curtis * Beverly D'Angelo * Robert De Niro * Bruce Dern * Danny DeVito * Michael Douglas * Brad Dourif * Richard Dreyfuss * Faye Dunaway * Robert Duvall * Shelley Duvall * Clint Eastwood * Peter FalkPersonal CriticismThe New Yorker * Mia Farrow * Louise Fletcher * Jane Fonda * Peter Fonda * Harrison Ford * Jodie Foster * Teri Garr * Ben Gazzara * Richard Gere * Elliott Gould * Lee Grant Oscar-winner Lee Grant talks classic films, the blacklist and being a female director in Hollywood - Los Angeles Times * Pam Grier * Charles Grodin * Gene Hackman * Goldie Hawn * Dustin Hoffman * Glenda Jackson * Madeline Kahn * Carol Kane * Diane Keaton * Harvey Keitel * Sally Kellerman * Margot Kidder * Kris Kristofferson * Diane Ladd * Jessica Lange * Cloris Leachman * Paul Newman * Jack Nicholson * Warren Oates * Ryan O'Neal * Tatum O'Neal * Peter O'Toole * Al Pacino * Sidney Poitier * Robert Redford * Vanessa Redgrave * Burt Reynolds * Jason Robards * Gena Rowlands * Roy Scheider * George Segal * Martin Sheen * Sam Shepard * Cybill Shepherd * Tom Skerritt * Sissy Spacek * Sylvester Stallone * Mary Steenburgen * Meryl Streep * Barbra Streisand * Donald Sutherland * Lily Tomlin * Rip Torn * John Travolta * Jon Voight * Sigourney Weaver * Gene Wilder = Directors = * Woody Allen * Robert Altman * Michelangelo Antonioni * Hal AshbyThe shallow Hal skims the career of the director behind Harold And Maude and Being There-AV Club * John G.

In the Hebrew Bible, Tophet or Topheth (; ; ) was a location in Jerusalem in the Gehinnom, where worshipers influenced by the ancient Canaanite religion engaged in child sacrifice to the gods Moloch and Baal by burning children alive. Tophet became a theological or poetic synonym for Hell within Christendom. The traditional explanation that a burning rubbish heap in the Valley of Hinnom south of Jerusalem gave rise to the idea of a fiery Gehenna of judgment is attributed to Rabbi David Kimhi's commentary on Psalm 27 (). He maintained that in this loathsome valley, fires were kept burning perpetually to consume the filth and cadavers thrown into it.Hermann L. Strack and Paul Billerbeck, Kommentar zum Neuen Testament aus Talmud and Midrasch, 5 vols., Munich: Beck, 1922–1956, 4:2:1030  Etymology  According to the Hebrew Bible, the Valley of Hinnom was used as a place for worshipers in Canaan to burn their own children alive as sacrifices. One section of the Hinnom Valley was called Topheth (also spelled Tophet or Topeth), where the children were slaughtered (). Medieval Jewish commentators David Kimhi and Rashi claimed that the name Topheth is derived from the Hebrew word toph, meaning a drum, because the cries of children being sacrificed by the priests of Moloch were masked by the sound of the beating on drums or tambourines.David Kimhi in the Mikraot GedolotRashi on Jeremiah 7:31 According to Philip King (1993), the derivation is uncertain, but may come from an Aramaic word meaning \\"hearth\\", \\"fireplace\\", or \\"roaster\\". The term is spelled Topheth in most English Bibles, but it appears in versions such as the King James and New King James as \\"Tophet\\". Biblical references The following references are made in the Hebrew Bible. In YHWH (Yahweh) states his contempt for child sacrifices. The practice of burning children in Topheth was ended by Josiah, King of Judah, who \\"defiled Topheth\\" as part of his great religious reforms (). Topheth is also mentioned in , , and . The closest biblical description available to Tophet is in Isaiah 30:33 where he describes it as a place of brimstone, which the Targum translates as Gehenna or hell.  Literary references  Various works of literature refer to Topheth, including John Milton's Paradise Lost, Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick.  In popular culture The Devil in the film Oh, God! You Devil also was named Harry O. Tophet, played by George Burns. In the 2009 American postapocalyptic film The Road, \\"Behold the Valley of Slaughter—Jeremiah 19:6\\" is scrawled in spray paint on a billboard above an entrance to a bridge. Needful Things, a 1991 horror novel by Stephen King, has a character reference Tophet in its opening pages.Stephen King, Needful Things, 1991, p. 4 In the animated series Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles, Tophet is the name of an alien planet that experiences endless intense heat due to a tidally locked orbit with its host star.

Team members work together at length to solve a predefined long-term problem and present their solution to the problem at a competition. They must also participate in the spontaneous portion of the competition by generating solutions to a problem they have not seen before. While the long-term problem solution often takes many months to complete and involves various elements of theatrical performance, construction and design, the spontaneous portion occurs on the day of the competition. Odyssey of the Mind is a trademark of Creative Competitions, Inc. (CCI). Competitions are administered by a mixture of regional non-profit associations and the for-profit CCI corporation.  History  OMER the raccoon (right) is the mascot of Odyssey. He is shown here with SNYPS, the New York state mascot. The Odyssey of the Mind program was co- founded by C. Samuel Micklus and Theodore Gourley in 1978 at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) in Glassboro, New Jersey. That first competition, known as \\"Olympics of the Mind\\", involved teams from 28 New Jersey schools. The program is now international, with teams from Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Canada, China, Czech Republic, DODDS, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Switzerland, Togo, the United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan, regularly competing in addition to teams from the United States.Learn More link on the Odyssey of the Mind website  Organization  Odyssey of the Mind teams are divided into four divisions: *Division I — Grades 3–5 (U.S.): Less than 12 years of age on May 1 of the competition year (Other International). *Division II — Grades 6–8 (U.S.): Less than 15 years of age on May 1 of the competition year (Other International). *Division III — Grades 9–12 (U.S.): Oldest team member does not qualify for Divisions I or II and is attending regular school—not a college or university or anything similar (Other International). *Division IV — Collegiate for all teams. All team members must have a high school diploma or its equivalent and be enrolled in at least one course at a two- or four-year college or university. The oldest team member determines the team's division. There is also a non-competitive primary division for young children (grades K–2 U.S.), who are given a simplified problem and fewer constraints than the higher divisions. They present and are given feedback at the first level tournament and cannot advance, except for special occasions where officials invite a team to perform again at the State level. Teams are limited to a maximum of seven team members. In the United States, each participating state has its own Odyssey association. Most states are further broken down into regions. Teams compete at the regional level first. The highest-scoring teams progress to the state level. In the U.S. there is no national level. State-winning teams go directly to the World Finals, which have always been held in the U.S., usually at the end of May.  Creative problems  =Long-term problems= There are five categories of problems that participants can solve: *Vehicle: building vehicles of different sizes to perform specified tasks. *Technical: building “innovative contraptions”. *Classics: incorporates knowledge of architecture, art, and literature; can be a documentary or behind-the-scenes feature. *Structure: designing and building a structure using only balsa wood and glue to support the highest weight load *Performance: acting, singing, and/or dancing based on a given theme In addition to its main category, a problem may involve techniques from other categories. For example, acting is prevalent in solutions to all five problems, and a team can usually earn bonus points by throwing in knowledge of history into a non-Classics problem or technology in a non-Tech problem. Specifications differ between problems, but there are some crucial rules. The Outside Assistance rule heavily stresses that every aspect of a solution must result from the work of the team; parents and coaches must restrict themselves to supervising safety and encouraging focus. Something as simple as a mother adjusting her child’s hat prior to competition is considered outside assistance, with a score penalty. Thus all brainstorming, building, painting, sewing, and fixing are to be done by the team. For each long-term problem, the team must present its solution in eight minutes or less, including set-up time, and the total cost of all materials used must either be under the specified Cost Limit of $125 or $145. The rules require participants to push their thinking capacities to make best use of their skills, time, and money. A new problem for each category is presented every year on the official Odyssey of the Mind website. Most years, one problem is sponsored by NASA.  Cost limit  There is a \\"cost\\" limit on the value of all materials used in the presentation of the long-term solution. This limit is typically US$125-145, where the classical, performance, and primary problems have a limit of $125, while the vehicle, technical, and structural problems have a limit of $145. As of the 2006–2007 rules update, some materials have a set \\"assigned value\\". Some examples include computers and most audio-visual equipment (projectors, radios, televisions, music players, etc.). The suggested cost to write these items down as is anywhere between $5–$10. Still other materials are simply \\"exempt\\" from cost. This includes batteries and power cords, footwear, tables and chairs. All of these materials, even the exempt, must be listed on the \\"cost form\\". The judges check this list to make sure that the team is within the cost limit and following the appropriate assigned values and exemptions.  Style  Style is a component of long-term where teams are scored on specific elements of their presentation. There are five elements scored in style. Often, two of these elements are specified in the problem, the other two are then \\"free choice of team\\" elements, and the fifth is a score of how well the other elements contribute to the performance overall. The pre-specified elements are related to the problem in some way; they are typically something to do with the appearance of a vehicle, costume, or prop. The free choice items may be anything the team wishes as long as they are not already scored as part of the long-term solution or pre-specified elements. Each element is scored from 1–10, accounting for 50 points of the overall score. =Spontaneous= As the name suggests, teams do not know ahead of time the topic they are to compete in. At the tournament, individual teams enter the competition room and are presented with one of three problem types: Verbal, Hands-on, or Verbal/Hands- On. In Verbal problems, teams are usually given a minute to think and then two to three minutes to respond to a theme such as \\"make a rhyme using a name or species of an animal\\". Teams will then be graded based on the creativity of their individual responses. For instance, \\"there is a dog on a log\\" is a common answer which would earn the team one point, while \\"I can step on an ant, but an uncle I can't\\" involves word play, a creative response that is worth 3 or 5 points. Verbal problems encourage individuals to incorporate their knowledge of history, science, literature, and popular culture. Hands-on problems focus on teamwork and the ability to listen to complicated directions. Teams will usually be instructed to build something based on the limited materials given, such as a freestanding tower using a few sheets of paper, some paper clips, a pair of scissors, and a piece of tape. The team with the tallest tower and the best teamwork earns the most points. In OM, if the rules do not say that something cannot be done, then it can; in other words, participants are encouraged to search for creative, outside-the-box solutions. A Hybrid, or Verbal/Hands-On, problem has aspects of both types, typically either a verbal problem that involves manipulation of physical objects or a two-part problem: build something in part 1, and provide verbal responses with it in part 2. Teams are allowed up to seven team members in total, but only five may compete in Spontaneous at the tournament. The others may watch the competition, but may not help. Before the competition the team should decide who is on the Verbal, Hands-on, and Verbal/Hands-on subteams, so they can quickly assemble soon after entering the competition room and learning the problem type.  World Finals  All teams who advance from their state finals, or their national finals if they are from outside of the US, are invited to World Finals. World Finals is the culmination of the entire year of Odyssey of the Mind. * 2020 – Held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic * 2019 – Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, May 22-25 * 2018 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, May 23–26 * 2017 – Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, May 24–27 * 2016 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, May 25–28 * 2015 – Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, May 20–23 * 2014 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, May 28–31 * 2013 – Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, May 22–25 * 2012 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, May 23–26 * 2011 – University of Maryland (College Park), May 27–30 * 2010 – Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, May 26–29 * 2009 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, May 27–30 * 2008 – University of Maryland (College Park), May 31–June 3 * 2007 – Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, May 23–26 * 2006 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, May 24–27 * 2005 – University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, May 21–24 * 2004 – University of Maryland (College Park), May 29–June 1 * 2003 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, May 28–31 * 2002 – University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, May 22–25 * 2001 – University of Maryland (College Park), June 2–5 * 2000 – University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, May 31–June 3 * 1998 – Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida * 1997 – University of Maryland (College Park) * 1996 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa * 1995 – University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee * 1994 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa * 1993 – University of Maryland (College Park) * 1992 – University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado * 1991 – University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee * 1990 – Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa * 1989 – University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado * 1988 – University of Maryland (College Park) * 1987 – Central Michigan University * 1986 – Northern Arizona University * 1985 – University of Maryland (College Park) *1984 - University of Akron in Akron, Ohio A variety of non-competitive activities are provided at World Finals; the representative one is pin trading, in which participants trade pins from their regions and states with participants from other states and countries. There is a creativity festival where each state/country runs a booth containing a fun activity related to their state. The highlights of World Finals are the opening and closing ceremonies. These ceremonies are held Olympics style in a stadium on campus. Teams march in and sit with other competitors from their state. After the closing ceremonies, several parties are held for different age groups, and a party is held for the coaches. These parties are a reward for all the hard work that teams have put in. The float and banner parade is another fun event that happens on the Thursday night of worlds. It is a parade in which every state and country participating makes a float and or a banner in to represent their state. The coaches competition is another event that is put on during world finals. The completion is only for coaches and is more along the lines of a spontaneous problem than a long term. The coaches get the problem in advance and have time to prepare. They hand out awards to the 1st,2nd, and 3rd place coaches.  Pin Trading  Pin Trading is a non-mandatory event that most teams participate in when attending world finals. From the second you arrive at the world finals competition you will find teams with pins displayed out in front of them on pin towels. You can buy these pin towels from the competition souvenir shop at the competition. Odyssey of the mind does sell some “problem pins” that have the name of the current year's problems as well as some other souvenir like pins. Those pins, however, are not what most people trade. The collectible pins are the ones that teams bring from their home state or country. Almost every team will bring pins that represent odyssey of the mind from their home. Most pins will be marked with their state/country abbreviation followed by OM for Odyssey of the Mind for example if you get a pin from Connecticut it would say CTOM on it. Odyssey of the Mind has a list of pin trading rules. They are as follows 1\\\\. (1) Respect others. Not everyone at World Finals trades pins, and there are always teams preparing to compete that should not be distracted. 2\\\\. (2) Trade pins in designated pin-trading areas. Do NOT trade pins in any area marked “No Pin Trading.” 3\\\\. (3) Pin-trading is not allowed at the team entrance or spectator entrance to any performance site. It is not allowed in any stairwells, doorways, or entrances to buildings. It is also not allowed in any area where teams compete or where others gather to watch teams compete. 4\\\\. (4) If you are in a designated pin-trading area in a hallway, be sure to allow enough room for people to pass by. 5\\\\. (5) If an Odyssey of the Mind or University Official asks you to stop trading pins or to move from an area, you must honor that person’s request. 6\\\\. (6) Never taunt others by criticizing a trade, any pin someone is trading, or anyone’s collection. 7\\\\. (7) If you trade in a location where pin-trading is not allowed, or tease others about their pins and trades, your pin collection may be confiscated. If your collection is confiscated, you will be able to pick it up the following morning at the Odyssey of the Mind Information booth. Only Odyssey of the Mind officials, your parents, or your coach may confiscate your pin collection. 8\\\\. (8) Do not trade with officials while they are working. 9\\\\. (9) Do not pressure anyone into a trade. 10\\\\. (10) Please show your Odyssey of the Mind Spirit when trading pins. Do not take advantage of youngsters or first-time traders. If only fair trades are made, the Odyssey of the Mind World Finals experience will be all the better for everyone. If you find lost pins, please take them to the Odyssey Information booth. There are some more unspoken rules around pin trading such as the pins from foreign countries are often seen as more valuable, because they are more rare. Often pins with a popular cartoon or image will become more rare compared to an OMER pin. Pins are often sold and traded in two ways. One way is in a set where there is a pin that represents each problem or sometimes each division. There are also individual pins that just say where they came from. It is not as valuable to have a “broken set” and more often than not people won’t want to trade for one.  Scoring  Each team is given a score out of 350 points: 200 from Long- term, 100 from Spontaneous, and 50 from Style. Style is scored from 1–10 in each of the five categories, and the Long-term and Spontaneous problems are scored according to each problem's individual rules. The scores awarded are then scaled within each problem and division based upon the highest score achieved by any team in each of the three scoring categories. So, for instance, the team scoring highest in Long-term in a particular problem and division receives 200 points, and the scores for the other teams in that problem and division are scaled proportionately. A team ranking first in its problem and division in all three elements of the competition would thus receive a \\"perfect\\" score of 350 points, regardless of the actual raw scores assigned by the judges. The Ranatra Fusca Creativity Award is granted to teams who have demonstrated exceptional creativity, the essence of the Odyssey of the Mind program. Winning The Ranatra Fusca Creativity Award at the regional or state level will qualify a team to advance to the next level of competition, even if the team had not placed high enough to advance on their own.

Ballard was born in Newton, Kansas and married his wife in Chicago in 1916. Ballard served in the U.S. Army in World War I, and then became a mining engineer. Both Edna and Guy studied Theosophy and the occult extensively. Revelation Living at the base of the California volcano Mount Shasta in 1930, Ballard frequently hiked on the mountain, where he reported the following to have occurred. > It came time for lunch, and I sought a mountain spring for clear, cold > water.

Ballard provided details of his encounters with St. Germain and other Ascended Masters in the books Unveiled Mysteries and The Magic Presence, using the pen name Godfré Ray King. Guy Ballard, his wife Edna, and their son Edona Eros \\"Donald\\" Ballard (1918-1973) claimed to be the sole \\"accredited messengers\\" of Saint Germain. Their teachings constitute the original nucleus of what are today called the \\"Ascended Master Teachings\\" and are still used in \\"I AM\\" Sanctuaries all over the world. Activity The \\"I AM\\" Activity started from public lectures about these encounters and grew rapidly in the 1930s. Ballard lectured frequently in Chicago about Saint Germain's mystical teachings, in which America was destined to play a key role. By 1938, there were claimed to be about a million followers in the United States. The \\"I AM\\" Activity describes itself as an apolitical, spiritual and educational organization financed by contributions from its members. Its parent organization is Saint Germain Foundation, with headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.Saint Germain Foundation. The History of the \\"I AM\\" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 2003 The \\"I AM\\" Activity began after Mr. Ballard's alleged meeting with Saint Germain, an Ascended Master, whose experiences are outlined in Volume One of the Saint Germain Series of Books, \\"Unveiled Mysteries\\", published by the Saint Germain Press. The year was 1930 when Mr. Ballard met Saint Germain according to the SaintGermainFoundation.Org website. Deaths of Ballard and his wife Ballard died on 29 December 1939 and Edna Ballard died on 12 February 1971 A new dispensation was reputedly given so that the \\"ascension\\" could be gained (in the finer body) without taking the physical body, as Jesus had done. The \\"ascended master bodies\\" were reputedly already prepared for Ballard and Edna Ballard as noted in Unveiled Mysteries by Godfre Ray King (the pen name of Guy Ballard). It is reported that both Ballards ascended upon passing out of the physical body. Godfre Ray King has also reputedly given dictations through Edna Ballard (under the pen name of \\"Lotus Ray King\\"). Given the \\"I AM\\" Activity, old occult laws have been replaced including the teaching of Theosophy that, to become a master, a person would have had to ascend upon death to the fifth level of initiation. Ascended Master Godfre It is believed by those who adhere to the Ascended Master Teachings that Guy Ballard, after his death, became the Ascended Master Godfre.

This early complete work, which the author never submitted for publication, describes the schemes of the title character. Synopsis Lady Susan Vernon, a beautiful and charming recent widow, visits her brother- and sister-in-law, Charles and Catherine Vernon, with little advance notice at Churchill, their country residence. Catherine is far from pleased, as Lady Susan had tried to prevent her marriage to Charles and her unwanted guest has been described to her as \\"the most accomplished coquette in England\\". Among Lady Susan's conquests is the married Mr. Manwaring. Catherine's brother Reginald arrives a week later, and despite Catherine's strong warnings about Lady Susan's character, soon falls under her spell. Lady Susan toys with the younger man's affections for her own amusement and later because she perceives it makes her sister-in-law uneasy. Her confidante, Mrs. Johnson, to whom she writes frequently, recommends she marry the very eligible Reginald, but Lady Susan considers him to be greatly inferior to Manwaring. Frederica, Lady Susan's 16-year-old daughter, tries to run away from school when she learns of her mother's plan to marry her off to a wealthy but insipid young man she loathes. She also becomes a guest at Churchill. Catherine comes to like her—her character is totally unlike her mother's—and as time goes by, detects Frederica's growing attachment to the oblivious Reginald. Later, Sir James Martin, Frederica's unwanted suitor, shows up uninvited, much to her distress and her mother's vexation. When Frederica begs Reginald for support out of desperation (having been forbidden by Lady Susan to turn to Charles and Catherine), this causes a temporary breach between Reginald and Lady Susan, but the latter soon repairs the rupture. Lady Susan decides to return to London and marry her daughter off to Sir James. Reginald follows, still bewitched by her charms and intent on marrying her, but he encounters Mrs. Manwaring at the home of Mr. Johnson and finally learns Lady Susan's true character. Lady Susan ends up marrying Sir James herself, and allows Frederica to reside with Charles and Catherine at Churchill, where Reginald De Courcy \\"could be talked, flattered, and finessed into an affection for her.\\" Main characters *Lady Susan Vernon The main character is aged about 35 or 36 years old (middle-aged for the time). She is the daughter of an earl. She is a widow of just a few months, who is known to flagrantly manipulate and seduce single and married men alike. As she has been left in a financially precarious state due to the death of her first husband, she uses flirtation and seduction to gain her objectives and maintain a semblance of her former opulent lifestyle. As a widow and a mother, her main goals are to quickly marry off her daughter Frederica (of whom she is contemptuous, regarding her as stupid and stubborn) to a wealthy man, and to marry an even better match herself. Mrs. Vernon describes her as > \\"...really excessively pretty. (...) I have seldom seen so lovely a woman as > Lady Susan. She is delicately fair, with fine grey eyes and dark eyelashes; > and from her appearance one would not suppose her more than five and twenty, > though she must in fact be ten years older. I was certainly not disposed to > admire her (...) but I cannot help feeling that she possesses an uncommon > union of symmetry, brilliancy and grace.\\" Lady Susan is cold towards her daughter, for whom she feels little or no affection: she calls her \\"a stupid girl\\" who \\"has nothing to recommend her.\\" It is possible that Jane Austen drew on the character of the mother of her neighbour, a beautiful Mrs. Craven, who had actually treated her daughters quite cruelly, locking them up, beating and starving them, till they ran away from home or married beneath their class to escape. There is an ironic contrast between the beautiful but determinedly chaste Susannah of the Old Testament and Lady Susan. *Frederica Vernon Daughter of Lady Susan. Oppressed by her mother, Frederica is very shy and it is only over time that the reader can perceive that rather than being stupid and stubborn, she is a sweet, sensible girl whose kind nature continually is at odds with Lady Susan's venal selfishness. Frederica is not as beautiful as her mother, but has a mild, delicate prettiness which, together with her evident ability to feel gratitude, endears her to the Vernons. *Catherine Vernon Sister-in-law to Lady Susan. Lady Susan easily perceives how much Mrs. Vernon dislikes her, but allows that she is \\"well bred\\" and has the air of \\"a woman of fashion.\\" She feels far more affection and concern for Frederica than Lady Susan does, and often laments Lady Susan's great neglect of her daughter. *Charles Vernon Brother-in-law to Lady Susan. An amenable man who allows her to stay at his home. *Reginald De Courcy Brother of Mrs. Vernon. He is handsome, kind, warm, and open, but rather gullible. Mrs. Vernon writes in a letter to their mother, \\"Oh! Reginald, how is your judgment enslaved!\\" *Lady De Courcy Confidante and mother of Mrs. Vernon. Lady De Courcy trusts her daughter's judgement and is concerned that Reginald not be taken in by Lady Susan. *Alicia Johnson The intimate friend to whom Lady Susan confides all her true scheming. Mrs. Johnson has an immoral mindset similar to that of her friend. Stuck in a marriage with a sensible man whom she does not love, whom Lady Susan derisively describes as \\"just old enough to be formal, ungovernable and to have the gout – too old to be agreeable, and too young to die\\", she delights in hearing of and making suggestions for Lady Susan's manipulative plans. Analysis Although the theme, together with the focus on character study and moral issues, is close to Austen's published work (Sense and Sensibility was also originally written in the epistolary form), its outlook is very different, and Lady Susan has few parallels in 19th-century literature. She is a selfish, unscrupulous and scheming woman, highly attractive to men, who is perfectly unashamed of her relationship with a married man. She subverts all the standards of the romantic novel: she has an active role, she is not only beautiful but intelligent and witty, and her suitors are significantly younger than she is (in contrast to Sense and Sensibility and Emma, which feature marriages by their female protagonists to men who are 16 years older). Although the ending includes a traditional reward for morality, Lady Susan herself is treated more leniently than the adulteress, Maria Bertram, in Mansfield Park, who is severely punished. Film and television adaptations As of 2009, Lady Susan was being adapted by British writer Lucy Prebble for Celador Films and BBC4.Rod Hall Agency:Retrieved 10 January 2009 Whit Stillman's adaptation of Lady Susan, retitled Love & Friendship after Austen's juvenile work of that name, was included in the Sundance Film Festival in January 2016. The US release date was May 13, 2016. The film stars Kate Beckinsale, Chloe Sevigny, Xavier Samuel and Stephen Fry. It received strongly positive reviews. Stage and book adaptations A two-woman version of Lady Susan, adapted by Inis Theatre, played at the Dublin fringe festival in 2001-2. An adaptation by Christine U'Ren was performed by Bella Union Theatre Company at the Berkeley City Club in Berkeley, California, in July 2009. Lady Susan (a novel), a 1980 complete re-write by Phyllis Ann Karr. Lady Vernon and Her Daughter, a novel-length reconstruction of Lady Susan, was published by Crown Publishing in 2009. Written by mother-and-daughter co-authors Jane Rubino and Caitlen Rubino-Bradway, the adaptation reinterprets the work to conform closely to Austen's more mature prose style. A further adaptation of the text, in the form of a novelization by director Whit Stillman, was announced for publication to coincide with the general release of the film (under the same title) on 13 May 2016, starring Kate Beckinsale. Alexandra Alter of The New York Times states in her 2016 interview article with Stillman, describing the novelization: \\"In the novel, Mr. Stillman takes the characters and plot from Austen's fictionalized letters and narrates the tale from the perspective of Lady Susan's nephew, who hopes to counter criticism of his maligned aunt. The 41 letters from Austen's Lady Susan are included in an appendix.\\" Stillman told Alter that he felt Lady Susan was not quite finished and thought the form of the book was \\"so flawed\\". After realising that there was another story to be told, he convinced the publisher Little, Brown and Company to let him write the novel.

Excipients can also be useful in the manufacturing process, to aid in the handling of the active substance concerns such as by facilitating powder flowability or non-stick properties, in addition to aiding in vitro stability such as prevention of denaturation or aggregation over the expected shelf life. The selection of appropriate excipients also depends upon the route of administration and the dosage form, as well as the active ingredient and other factors. A comprehensive classification system based on structure- property-application relationships has been proposed for excipients used in parenteral medications. Pharmaceutical regulations and standards require that all ingredients in drugs, as well as their chemical decomposition products, be identified and shown to be safe. Often, more excipient is found in a final drug formulation than active ingredient, and practically all marketed drugs contain excipients. As with new drug substances and dosage forms thereof, novel excipients themselves can be patented; sometimes, however, a particular formulation involving them is kept as a trade secret instead (if not easily reverse-engineered). The Excipients Industry Forum as a multi stake-holder forum and information hub for the wider excipients industry and the public. Its goal is to promote open dialogue and partnership between the public, policy makers and the pharmaceutical industry.Excipients Industry Forum The Federation of International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC),IPEC a pharmaceutical regulatory non-profit, develops, implements, and promotes global use of appropriate quality, safety, and functionality standards for pharmaceutical excipients and excipient delivery systems. IPEC-Americas, along with its counterparts in Europe, China, and Japan serves as a primary international resource on excipients for its members, governments, and public audiences. IPEC works in collaboration with ExcipientFest to present topics ranging from regulatory affairs to research and development, often featuring speakers from FDA and other pharmaceutical organizations.ExcipientFest Relative versus absolute inactivity Though excipients were at one time assumed to be \\"inactive\\" ingredients, it is now understood that they can sometimes be \\"a key determinant of dosage form performance\\"; in other words, their effects on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, although usually negligible, cannot be known to be negligible without empirical confirmation and sometimes are important. For that reason, in basic research and clinical trials they are sometimes included in the control substances in order to minimize confounding, reflecting that otherwise, the absence of the active ingredient would not be the only variable involved, because absence of excipient cannot always be assumed not to be a variable. Such studies are called excipient-controlled or vehicle-controlled studies. Types =Antiadherents= Antiadherents reduce the adhesion between the powder (granules) and the punch faces and thus prevent sticking to tablet punches by offering a non-stick surface. They are also used to help protect tablets from sticking. The most commonly used is magnesium stearate. =Binders= Binders hold the ingredients in a tablet together. Binders ensure that tablets and granules can be formed with required mechanical strength, and give volume to low active dose tablets. Binders are usually: * Saccharides and their derivatives: ** Disaccharides: sucrose, lactose; ** Polysaccharides and their derivatives: starches, cellulose or modified cellulose such as microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose ethers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC); ** Sugar alcohols such as xylitol, sorbitol or mannitol; * Protein: gelatin; * Synthetic polymers: polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG)... Binders are classified according to their application: *Solution binders are dissolved in a solvent (for example water or alcohol can be used in wet granulation processes). Examples include gelatin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, polyvinylpyrrolidone, starch, sucrose and polyethylene glycol. *Dry binders are added to the powder blend, either after a wet granulation step, or as part of a direct powder compression (DC) formula. Examples include cellulose, methyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyethylene glycol. =Coatings= Tablet coatings protect tablet ingredients from deterioration by moisture in the air and make large or unpleasant-tasting tablets easier to swallow. For most coated tablets, a cellulose ether hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) film coating is used which is free of sugar and potential allergens. Occasionally, other coating materials are used, for example synthetic polymers, shellac, corn protein zein or other polysaccharides. Capsules are coated with gelatin. Enterics control the rate of drug release and determine where the drug will be released in the digestive tract. Materials used for enteric coatings include fatty acids, waxes, shellac, plastics, and plant fibers. =Colours= Colours are added to improve the appearance of a formulation. Colour consistency is important as it allows easy identification of a medication. Furthermore, colours often improve the aesthetic look and feel of medications. Small amounts of colouring agents are easily processed by the body, although rare reactions are known, notably to tartrazine. Commonly, titanium oxide is used as a colouring agent to produce the popular opaque colours along with azo dyes for other colors. By increasing these organoleptic properties a patient is more likely to adhere to their schedule and therapeutic objectives will also have a better outcome for the patient especially children. =Disintegrants= Disintegrants expand and dissolve when wet causing the tablet to break apart in the digestive tract, or in specific segments of the digestion process, releasing the active ingredients for absorption. They ensure that when the tablet is in contact with water, it rapidly breaks down into smaller fragments, facilitating dissolution. Examples of disintegrants include: * Crosslinked polymers: crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone (crospovidone), crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (croscarmellose sodium). * The modified starch sodium starch glycolate. =Flavors= Flavors can be used to mask unpleasant tasting active ingredients and improve the acceptance that the patient will complete a course of medication. Flavorings may be natural (e.g. fruit extract) or artificial. For example, to improve: * a bitter product - mint, cherry or anise may be used * a salty product - peach, apricot or liquorice may be used * a sour product - raspberry or liquorice may be used * an excessively sweet product - vanilla may be used =Glidants= Glidants are used to promote powder flow by reducing interparticle friction and cohesion. These are used in combination with lubricants as they have no ability to reduce wall friction. Examples include silica gel, fumed silica, talc, and magnesium carbonate. However, some silica gel Glidants such as Syloid(R) 244 FP and Syloid(R) XDP are multi-functional and offer several other performance benefits in addition to reducing interparticle friction including moisture resistance, taste marketing etc. =Lubricants= Lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine. Lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and ejection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall. Common minerals like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, magnesium stearate or stearic acid are the most frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules. Lubricants are agents added in small quantities to tablet and capsule formulations to improve certain processing characteristics. While lubricants are often added to improve manufacturability of the drug products, it may also negatively impact the product quality. For example, extended mixing of lubricants during blending may results in delayed dissolution and softer tablets, which is often referred to as \\"over- lubrication\\". Therefore, optimizing lubrication time is critical during pharmaceutical development. There are three roles identified with lubricants as follows: *True lubricant role: :To decrease friction at the interface between a tablet’s surface and the die wall during ejection and reduce wear on punches & dies. *Anti-adherent role: :Prevent sticking to punch faces or in the case of encapsulation, lubricants :Prevent sticking to machine dosators, tamping pins, etc. *Glidant role: :Enhance product flow by reducing interparticulate friction. There are two major types of lubricants: *Hydrophilic :Generally poor lubricants, no glidant or anti-adherent properties. *Hydrophobic :Most widely used lubricants in use today are of the hydrophobic category. Hydrophobic lubricants are generally good lubricants and are usually effective at relatively low concentrations. Many also have both anti-adherent and glidant properties. For these reasons, hydrophobic lubricants are used much more frequently than hydrophilic compounds. Examples include magnesium stearate. =Preservatives= Some typical preservatives used in pharmaceutical formulations are * Antioxidants like vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, retinyl palmitate, and selenium * The amino acids cysteine and methionine * Citric acid and sodium citrate * Synthetic preservatives like the parabens: methyl paraben and propyl paraben. =Sorbents= Sorbents are used for tablet/capsule moisture-proofing by limited fluid sorbing (taking up of a liquid or a gas either by adsorption or by absorption) in a dry state. For example, desiccants absorb water, drying out (desiccating) the surrounding materials. =Sweeteners= Sweeteners are added to make the ingredients more palatable, especially in chewable tablets such as antacid or liquids like cough syrup. Sugar can be used to mask unpleasant tastes or smells, but articificial sweeteners tend to be preferred, as natural ones tend to cause tooth decay. =Vehicles= In liquid and gel formulations, the bulk excipient that serves as a medium for conveying the active ingredient is usually called the vehicle. Petrolatum, dimethyl sulfoxide and mineral oil are common vehicles.

He was a diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1661 to 1666. During the English Civil War he supported the Royalist cause and served King Charles II in battle and in exile. Early life Fanshawe was the fourth and youngest son of Sir Henry Fanshawe, of Ware Park, Hertfordshire and his wife Elizabeth Smythe, daughter of Thomas Smythe, of Ostenhanger Kent and was baptised at Ware on 12 June 1608. His father, who was Remembrancer of the Exchequer, died in 1616.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume III, 1649-1664 1902 Fanshawe was admitted at Jesus College, Cambridge in November 1623 and was admitted to Inner Temple on 22 January 1626. He travelled on the Continent, and in 1635 was Secretary to the Embassy at the Court of Spain. In 1638, he was Chargé d'Affaires there. He was an accomplished linguist, whose knowledge of the \\"modern languages\\" like Spanish and Italian is said to have been a great advantage to him in his diplomatic career. Civil War When the Civil War broke out, Fanshawe sided with the King. He was Secretary of War to the Prince of Wales in 1644 and in 1648 had credentials for Spain, where he was sent to obtain money for the cause. From 1648 to 1650, he was Treasurer of the Navy under Prince Rupert. He was created a baronet on 2 September 1650, and soon afterwards was Secretary of State in Scotland to the young King Charles II. He was captured at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. He was knighted at Breda in April 1660, and made Latin Secretary and Master of Requests for King Charles when in Holland. Restored monarchy After the Restoration Fanshawe held various appointments. He represented James, Duke of York at the Coronation on 23 April 1661. In 1661 he was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridge University for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death. History of Parliament Online - Fanshawe, Sir Richard From 1662 to 1666, he was Ambassador to Portugal and from 1664 to 1666 was also ambassador to Spain. In 1666 Fanshawe was making preparations to return to England when he died suddenly at Siete Chimeneas, his house in Madrid at the age of 58. Memorials His body was returned to England from Spain. He was initially buried at Allhallows, Hertford, and a few years later removed to St Mary's Church, Ware, where there is a monument (a marble aedicule). A portrait of Richard Fanshawe is on display with other portraits of the family at Valence House Museum in east London. Works Fanshawe translated Giovanni Battista Guarini's Il pastor fido, Selected Parts of Horace, and The Lusiad of Camoens, the first English translation of the latter work (circulated from 1655 or earlier). Family Fanshawe married at Wolvercot, Oxfordshire on 18 May 1644, his second cousin Anne Harrison daughter of Sir John Harrison, of Ball's Park, Ware and Margaret Fanshawe, daughter of Robert Fanshawe of Fanshawe Gate in Holmesfield, Derbyshire. His wife, described as \\"devoted and able\\", wrote memoirs of her own life. They had fourteen children, but only five reached adulthood. His brother Thomas was created Viscount Fanshawe.

Such flexibility on the part of the author results in richer characterizations: Cassandra is constructed in fewer than thirty sentences and Austen relies on the audience's appreciation of the references she makes to issues of lineage, adventure, expectations of beauty and typical relationships.

Harper & Row published an American edition within the calendar year. Set during World War II, it features a boy abused at home in London who is evacuated to the country at the outbreak of the war. In the care of Mister Tom, an elderly recluse, he experiences a new life of loving and care. Magorian and Mister Tom won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime award judged by a panel of British children's writers. She was also a commended runner up for the Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognising the year's best English-language children's book published in the UK. The novel has been twice adapted as a musical, once as a play and once as a film, Goodnight Mister Tom (1998). In 2003, the novel was listed at number 49 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\\"BBC – The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003.

Summary In September 1939, as Britain stands on the brink of the war, many young children from the cities are evacuated to the countryside to escape an imminent German bombardment. William Beech, a boy from Deptford who is physically and emotionally abused by his mother, arrives at the home of Tom Oakley, a widower in his sixties who lives in the village of Little Weirwold. The boy is thinly clad, underfed and covered with painful bruises, and believes he is full of sin, a result of his upbringing by his mother, a domineering, insane and god-fearing woman. Willie is also pale, timid and sickly-looking. \\"Mister Tom\\", as William christens his new guardian, is reclusive and bad-tempered, and as such is avoided by the community. Willie is placed with him because his mother wanted him to live with someone who was either religious or lived near a church. Though initially distant, he is touched after discovering William's home-life and treats him with kindness and understanding, helping to educate him. Under his care, William begins to thrive, forming a small circle of friends at school among his classmates including fellow-evacuee Zach. He also becomes proficient in drawing and dramatics. As William is changed by Tom, so is Tom transformed by William's presence in his home. It is revealed that Tom lost his wife and baby son to scarletina some 40 years previously, and he has become reclusive because of this. The growing bond between William and Tom is threatened when William's mother requests that the boy returns to her in the city, telling him she is sick. At first, William thinks this will be a good thing, as he can be helpful to his mother. However, his mother is not pleased to learn the details of his time with Tom, feeling that he has not been disciplined properly. While William has been away, she has become pregnant and had a girl, but is neglecting the baby. After a bad reunion, where his mother becomes furious upon learning the details of her son's life with Tom, abhorring his association with the Jewish Zach among other things, she hits William and, accusing him of blasphemy, puts him in the under-stairs cupboard, chaining him to the piping. William regains consciousness briefly to find himself in the cupboard – he has been stripped of his clothes, minus his underwear, and his ankle is twisted. He quietly sobs for Tom, before he falls asleep. Back in Little Weirwold, Tom has a premonition that something is not right with William. Although he has never travelled beyond his immediate locality, he ventures into London and eventually locates William's neighbourhood of Deptford and his home. He persuades a local policeman to break down the door of the apparently empty home, to be greeted with a vile stench. They find William in the closet with the baby, who had also been locked under the stairs by William's mother and has now died. William is malnourished and badly bruised as he had been locked under the stairs for a number of days. William is hospitalised, but whilst there suffers horrific nightmares and is drugged simply to prevent his screams from disturbing other children. Tom is warned that it is likely that William will be taken to a children's home, and, unable to observe William's distress any longer, kidnaps him from the hospital and takes him back to Little Weirwold. Back with Mister Tom, William is much damaged by his ordeal and is also blaming himself for the death of his sister as he had not been able to provide enough milk to feed her whilst locked away, and becomes very depressed. Later, when his favourite teacher Annie Hartridge has a baby, William is shocked to learn from Zach that a woman cannot conceive a child on her own, and realises that his mother was having a relationship with a man, even though she had previously told him that it was wrong for unmarried couples to live together or have children together (something which society in general had regarded as unacceptable at this time). Tom is traced by the authorities, who have come to tell William that his mother is dead, having taken her own life. They also offer him a place in a children's home, as they've been unable to trace any other relatives who may have been able to take care of him. But luckily, the authorities realise that William has already found a good home, and allow Tom to adopt him. Tom, William and Zach then enjoy a holiday at the seaside village of Salmouth, where they stay in the house of a widow whose sons have been sent out to war. Zach then receives news that his father has been injured by a German bomb in London and he hurries home on the next train saying farewell to all his friends. Unfortunately this is the last time they see him. William later learns that Zach has been killed and is grief-stricken for some time, but his grief is later healed by another recluse, Geoffrey Sanderton. Geoffrey, a young man who had lost a leg during the war and takes William for private art lessons, recognises the signs of grief and gives William a pipe to paint along with a picture of two smiling young men. One of the men is Geoffrey and he tells William about the loss of his own best friend, the other man in the picture and the owner of the pipe. This is when William starts to come to terms with Zach's death. Adding to this, Doctor Little, the village doctor, who was Zach's guardian while he was evacuated, is surprised but pleased when William asks to have Zach's bike. Through learning to ride it, William realises that Zach lives on inside him and he will never forget his wonderful companion that Zach was. In the months following, William grows closer to Carrie, one of his friends. One night, on returning home to Tom (whom he now calls \\"Dad\\"), he thinks back on how much he has changed since arriving in Little Weirwold and realises that he is growing. And he hasn't forgotten about Zach.

Normally, their trunks achieve up to 1.5 m in diameter, but some unusual individual trees in France have grown old enough to have much larger trunks – more than 3 meters DBH. Their leaves are diamond-shaped to triangular, 5–8 cm long and 6–8 cm broad, and green on both surfaces.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins. . The species is dioecious, male and female flowers are on different plants, with flowers in catkins and pollination achieved by the wind. The black poplar grows in low-lying areas of moist ground. Like most other pioneer species, the tree is characterized by rapid growth and is able to quickly colonize open areas. Poplar seed tufts =Subspecies= Three subspecies are established and some botanists distinguish a fourth: *P. n. subsp. nigra. Central and eastern Europe. Leaves and shoots glabrous (hairless); bark grey-brown, thick and furrowed. Burrs and normal bark on a black poplar tree (subspecies betulifolia) in Ayrshire, Scotland. *P. n. subsp. betulifolia (Pursh) W.Wettst. North-west Europe (France, Great Britain, Ireland). Leaf veins and shoots finely downy; bark grey-brown, thick and furrowed, often with heavy burrs, trunk usually heavily leaning. *P. n. subsp. caudina (Ten.) Bugała. Mediterranean region, also southwest Asia if var. afghanica not distinguished. *P. n. var. afghanica Aitch. & Hemsl. (syn. P. n. var. thevestina (Dode) Bean). Southwest Asia; treated as a cultivar of P. nigra by many botanists, and as a distinct species P. afghanica by others;Flora of Pakistan: Populus afghanica bark smooth, nearly white; leaves and shoots as subsp. caudina (see also cultivars, below). The subspecies P. n. betulifolia is one of the rarest trees in Great Britain and Ireland,Milne-Redhead, E. (1990). The B.S.B.I. Black Poplar survey, 1973-88. Watsonia 18: 1-5. Available online (pdf file).Arkive: Populus nigra with only about 7,000 trees known, of which only about 600 have been confirmed as female.Cooper, Fiona (2006). The Black Poplar: Ecology, History and Conservation. Windgather Press =Cultivars= Several cultivars have also been selected, these being propagated readily by cuttings: *'Italica' is the true Lombardy poplar, selected in Lombardy, northern Italy, in the 17th century. The growth is fastigiate (having the branches more or less parallel to the main stem), with a very narrow crown. Coming from the Mediterranean region, it is adapted to hot, dry summers and grows poorly in humid conditions, being short-lived due to fungal diseases. It is a male clone.Bean, W. J. (1980). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles Vol. 3. John Murray As a widely selected species chosen by golf architects in the 1960s, it soon became apparent that the poplar's very invasive roots destroyed land drainage systems. Decades later, the same courses were removing poplar stands wholesale. Around 40 to 50 years, this short-lived variety starts shedding branches and is very likely to be blown over in high winds, each successive tree lost exposing neighbouring trees, creating a domino effect. A fastigiate black poplar cultivar of the Plantierensis group, in Hungary *Plantierensis group clones are derived by crossing 'Italica' with P. nigra ssp. betulifolia at the Plantières Nursery near Metz in France in 1884; they are similar to 'Italica' (and often mistaken for it), but with a slightly broader crown, and better adapted to the cool, humid climate of northwest Europe, where the true Lombardy poplar does not grow well. Both male and female clones are grown. This is the tree most commonly grown in Great Britain and Ireland as Lombardy poplar. *'Manchester' is a cultivar of P. nigra subsp. betulifolia widely planted in northwest England. It is a male clone, and currently seriously threatened by poplar scab disease.Stace, C. A. (1971). The Manchester Poplar. Watsonia 8: 391-393.Arboricultural Information Exchange: Manchester Poplar Disease *'Gigantea' is another fastigiate clone, of unknown origin, with a rather broader, more vigorous crown than 'Italica'. It is a female clone. *'Afghanica' (syn. 'Thevestina'): most, if not all, specimens are of a single clone, and many botanists therefore treat it as a cultivar rather than a botanical variety. It is fastigiate, similar to 'Italica', but with a striking whitish bark; it also differs from 'Italica' in being a female clone. This is the common fastigiate poplar in southwest Asia and southeast Europe (the Balkans), where it was introduced during the Ottoman Empire period. Distribution Black poplar has a large distribution area throughout Europe and is also found in northern Africa and central and west Asia. The distribution area extends from the Mediterranean in the south to around 64° latitude in the north and from the British Isles in the west to Kazakhstan and China in the east. The distribution area also includes the Caucasus and large parts of the Middle East.

The authors were Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville, said to be responsible for the first three Acts, and the final two, respectively. The first quarto, published by the bookseller William Griffith, was published 22 September 1565.Cauthen, I. B. (1962) \\"'Gorboduc, Ferrex and Porrex'\\": The First Two Quartos\\". Studies in Bibliography 15: 231-3; p. 231. A second authorized quarto corrected by the authors followed in 1570 printed by John Day with the title The Tragedie of Ferrex and Porrex. A third edition was published in 1590 by Edward Allde.Ribner (1957) p. 38. The play is notable for several reasons: as the first verse drama in English to employ blank verse; for its political subject matter (the realm of Gorboduc is disputed by his sons Ferrex and Porrex), which was still a touchy area in the early years of Elizabeth's reign, while the succession to the throne was unclear; for its manner, progressing from the models of the morality play and Senecan tragedy in the direction which would be followed by later playwrights. That is, it can be seen as a forerunner of the whole trend that would later produce Titus AndronicusCarroll, James D. (2004) \\"Gorboduc and Titus Andronicus\\", Notes and Queries, 51: 267-9. and King Lear. It also provides the first well-documented performance of a play in Ireland: Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy staged it at Dublin Castle in 1601. Synopsis The playtext summarizes the plot in the 'Argument': \\"Gorboduc, King of Britain, divided his realm in his lifetime to his sons, Ferrex and Porrex. The sons fell to dissension. The younger killed the elder. The mother that more dearly loved the elder, for revenge killed the younger. The people, moved with the cruelty of the fact, rose in rebellion and slew both father and mother. The nobility assembled and most terribly destroyed the rebels. And afterward, for want of issue of the prince, whereby the succession of the crown became uncertain, they fell to civil war in which both they and many of their issues were slain, and the land for a long time almost desolate and miserably wasted.\\" Gorboduc announces his plan to divide his kingdom between his sons Ferrex and Porrex. His councillors advise against it, reminding him of the conflict that arose between the cousins Morgan and Cunedag when Britain was divided between them, which led to Morgan's death. Gorboduc appreciates their advice but goes ahead with his plan. Ferrex is advised by the parasite Hermon to take the whole Kingdom. Tyndar tells Porrex that his brother is making plans for war, meaning Porrex decides to invade Ferrex's realm. Dordan writes to Gorboduc of this. Gorboduc bewails this and is advised to raise a force against them. However, a nuntius (messenger) then enters, bearing the news of Ferrex's death. Porrex meets his father and justifies his actions, saying that he was content to rule his kingdom but that his brother plotted to take his lands. However, his mother Videna then stabs him dead while he is sleeping in revenge for Ferrex. The people rise up in anger and kill both her and Gorboduc, blaming the King for Porrex's death. The nobles prepare to act against the rebels. However, the succession is left uncertain. Fergus, Duke of Albany, plans to gain the throne and begins raising an army while his friends try to gather support. The nobles defeat the rebels, but hear that Fergus has raised an army and intends to take the crown. The nobles oppose Fergus, thinking of him as a foreign invader. Arostus says that Parliament must decide upon a new King. Eubulus bemoans the chaos that has happened to the country and says that Parliament should have been called while the King was alive, but that justice will eventually prevail.

The name Ulmus minor subsp. minor was used by R. H. RichensRichens, R. H., Elm (Cambridge 1983), p.280 for field elms that were not English elm, Cornish elm, Lock elm or Guernsey elm. Many publications, however, continue to use plain Ulmus minor for Richens's Ulmus minor subsp. minor. Indeed Dr Max Coleman of Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh argued in his 2002 paper 'British Elms' that there was no clear distinction between species and subspecies.Coleman M. (2002) 'British elms.' British Wildlife 13 (6): 390-395. Description The smooth-leaved elm is a deciduous tree that can grow to 35 m. Its Latin synonym carpinifolia alludes to the superficial similarity of the leaves to those of hornbeam Carpinus sp., while the common names contrast the smooth upper surface and narrowness of the leaves with those of the wych elm, which are rough and broad.Stace, C. A. (1997). New Flora of the British Isles, 2nd edition. Cambridge University Press.White, J. & More, D. (2003). Trees of Britain & Northern Europe. Cassell's, London. The apetalous perfect wind-pollinated flowers, and fruit (samaras) are very similar to those of the species. Pests and diseases Although the smooth- leaved elm is generally susceptible to Dutch elm disease, it is genetically a highly variable tree and it is possible some specimens survive in the UK owing to an innately high level of resistance (see Cultivation). Research currently (2009) in hand by Cemagref at Le Pepiniére forestiére de l'Etat, Guémené- Penfao, France, should confirm this. However, all smooth-leaved elm varieties are believed to have been introduced into Britain from central and southern Europe during the Bronze Age,Richens, R. H. (1983). Elm. Cambridge University Press. and some, being beyond their natural climates and environments, may be growing slowly and thus producing smaller springwood vessels restrictive to the Ophiostoma fungus. Good performance in the field may also be owing to resistance to bark beetle feeding or breeding. Moreover, several types of this subspecies also have very pendulous twigs when mature, a factor which could also make them unattractive to foraging Scolytus beetles, which are disinclined to invert themselves.Webber, J. (2008). Dutch elm disease in Britain. Forest Research, Forestry Commission, Alice Holt, Farnham, Surrey As the tree suckers readily, its genetic resources are not considered endangered.Collin, E., Bilger, I., Eriksson, G. & Turok, J.

Results from Spain (2013), for example, confirm that a very small number of surviving field elms (about 0.5% of those tested) appear to have comparatively high levels of tolerance of the disease, and it is hoped that a controlled crossing of the best of these will produce resistant Ulmus minor hybrids for cultivation.'Spanish Clones' (Oct. 2013) resistantelms.co.uk Narrow-leaved elm was occasionally planted as an ornamental urban tree.

It was essentially the European export-market version of the contemporary Nissan Pulsar, the first generation, and of the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy, the second generation. The name is currently also being used for several other versions of the car: the South Korean- manufactured Samsung SM3, in various export markets worldwide; the Nissan Latio, throughout the Southeast Asian markets; the second generation Nissan Bluebird Sylphy in Russia. __TOC__  First generation (N15; 1995)  Nissan Almera 5-door hatchback Nissan Almera GX sedan Nissan Almera 1.6 GX 3-door hatchback The first Nissan Almera rolled off the production line in late 1995, as a replacement for the Nissan Sunny (N14), a nameplate which had been in use for nearly 30 years. The Almera was almost identical to the Nissan Pulsar (N15) sold in Japan, except with different trim options and petrol engine range. Power came from 1.4 GA14DE and 1.6 GA16DE petrol and 2.0 CD20 diesel engines initially in 1995, but a year into production a 2.0 SR20DE-engined GTi was added to the range. The 1.4, 1.6 and 2.0D engines were available in a three- and five-door hatchbacks that were badge engineered versions of the Japanese market Nissan Pulsar Serie or a four-door saloon, whereas the GTi was only available in three-door hatch. In the UK, the Almera was originally marketed by Nissan as \\"the car they don't want you to drive\\".Marshall, Caroline \\"BACKBITE\\", BrandRepublic, 27 June 1997. Retrieved on 7 July 2015. Almost all Almeras sold in the United Kingdom were hatchbacks with three or five doors in contrast to regions such as Ireland, where the saloon version is substantially more commonplace. The level of specification was good, with all models getting power steering, driver airbag, electric mirrors and stereo as standard. Throughout the life of the Almera, many 'special editions' models were available but most of them didn't feature anything above other models. = Pre-facelift = Flagship models for each engine capacity are as follows: * 1.4 Si GA14DE * 1.6 SRi GA16DE * 2.0 GTi SR20DE 140ps/131 Lbf (GA engine1996 onwards, sold in bodykit and non-bodykit form) The above all included 'high- spec' bumpers with foglights (Optional on the Si model), alloy wheels from 1996 onwards (Different size and design between Si/SRi 14\\" and GTi 15\\"), and rear roof lip spoilers (GTi models sported an integrated brake light, also spoilers were optional on the Si). The 2.0-litre GTi had an optional 'aggressive-looking' factory bodykit, with BMW M3-style side skirts, and front/rear splitters. Non-bodykit models came with a simpler plastic front splitter. The GTi featured uprated suspension, front and rear strut braces and a quicker steering rack, = Facelift = Almera received a facelift for 1998 model year. For the phase 2, the front bumpers were re-designed, front splitters were added on the Si/SRi, and the GTi had all-round bodykit as standard (although there was also a delete option available), and now all of the lip spoilers had integrated brake lights. The original telescopic radio aerial was moved from the drivers A-pillar to the rear of the roof and was changed to a \\"bee-sting\\" type. On the GTi, the phase 2 headlights and front indicators featured a black surround. The bodykit itself was changed to a more subtle, straight design on the GTi, with the addition of vents on the rear splitter. Due to the high 'casualty rate' of Phase 1 splitters, due to the thin and brittle plastic used, Phase 2 bodykits were much sturdier. As such, it is not uncommon to find Phase 1 GTi's with Phase 2 bumpers or no splitter at all. Towards the end of production around the start of 1999, the GTi models came with all optional extras as standard from the factory such as ABS, A/C, updated interior trim, front seat pockets and so forth.  Second generation (N16; 2000)  Pre-facelift Nissan Almera E (United Kingdom) Launched in January 2000, the second-generation Nissan Almera differed from its predecessor with smooth, curved lines. Some still thought it bland in comparison with its rivals although the Almera was selling strongly worldwide. For Europe, this generation of Almera was produced at the Sunderland factory, which had opened in 1986 and produced the Micra, Primera and originally the Bluebird. The N16 Almera was based on Nissan's global MS-Platform, which was Nissan's first new platform to be developed after the partnership with Renault. The MS Platform was also the base for the new Primera and Almera Tino. The second-generation Almera was available in three different body styles, a three- or five-door hatch and a four-door saloon with 1.5 and 1.8 Nissan QG engine series petrol engines as well as a 2.2 direct injection turbodiesel (110 bhp) (YD22DDT) or common-rail turbodiesel (136 bhp) (YD22DDTi). Almeras can be also equipped with 1.5 common-rail turbodiesel (dCi) from the Renault Megane II – Nissan had recently ventured with Renault and the Almera's diesel engine was one of the first instances of Nissan and Renaults sharing mechanicals. Early versions of the 1.5-litre engine were fitted with a mechanical throttle, which was later replaced by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle. The Almera five-door hatchback was exported from the UK to Australia and New Zealand and sold as part of the Nissan Pulsar (N16) lineup in these countries. The Almera sedan is based on the Bluebird Sylphy, but has a different front end. The N16 Almera offered great improvements over the previous generation Almera in terms of handling, tyre grip and drive dynamics. The N16 Almera felt much more sure-footed on the road and was exceptionally nimble for a plain family car. While the previous generation Almera was considered spacious for its class, the N16 Almera was lacking in rear passenger legroom due to a slightly shorter than category average wheelbase although the Almera can still can be considered quite spacious and has the advantage of a bigger boot over the previous Almera. = Facelift = In 2003, the Almera was facelifted with updated styling, retuned suspension, new engines and an updated interior. First, the Almera's MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear suspension (Nissan's name for its double lateral link twist beam suspension) had been retuned. This resulted in a quieter ride and a reduction in the amount of rear bump-through experienced when heavily laden, improving high-speed stability, driving dynamics and making the car more controllable after an emergency manoeuver. The new suspension tuning also proved to produce almost no body roll on tight turns. Overall, Nissan said, the Almera had slightly firmer damper settings and marginally stiffer spring ratings; though there had been no loss of ride comfort or increase in noise levels in normal motoring. The suspension revisions had been executed in such a way as to only come into play at the upper edge of the dynamic envelope. The facelift also included new chrome, projector-style headlights that were set in a titanium-coloured surround with separate lights for main and low beams set behind an enlarged translucent cover. The front bumper now had an integrated engine air intake that ran almost the full width of the car while a honeycomb mesh grille added visual benefits to the frontal image. Some models also got small circular fog lights. The interior of the facelifted Almera had also been redesigned with better quality materials and a large colour or monochrome centre screen which controlled all of the car's functions (climate control, CD player and trip computer) was fitted to most models apart from S and Pulse. Higher trim levels also included Nissan's Bird-eye GPS system. ESP (Electronic Stability Program) was fitted to SE, SVE and the range topping SXE (which also got a switch to turn the ESP on or off). Additionally there was a change to the diesel model lineup. Nissan introduced new version of Common Rail 2.2 Diesel with 6-speed gearbox. = Production = The facelifted Almera was built in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, UK, and exported to parts of the Asia-Pacific where it was sold as the Nissan Pulsar. In 2006 the second-generation Almera reached its sixth year of production but was still selling strongly worldwide. It was also sold in Mexico in three versions: a five-door manual five-speed, a five-door automatic three-speed \\"Comfort\\" model and a three-door \\"Sport\\" version equipped with side curtain air bags, fog lamps and a five-speed manual transmission. The Almera finished production on 29 November 2006, but it was not instantly replaced. The Tiida was introduced in several countries as a replacement model throughout 2007 and 2008; although it has yet to be officially imported to the United Kingdom (where the Qashqai crossover is the only successor model on offer), it has been available there through the Arnold Clark dealership network since March 2009 with models sourced from the Republic of Ireland. = B10 (2006–2010) = In 2002, Renault Samsung Motors in South Korea started manufacturing the Renault Samsung SM3, sharing the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy N16 basis used for the Almera. It was facelifted in 2005, and from April 2006 it started selling as the Almera Classic in Ukraine and Russia, as the Almera B10 in Central America, Venezuela and Ecuador, and as the Sunny B10 in the Middle East. In Colombia, Mexico, Libya and Egypt, the car has been sold as the Renault Scala and in Chile as the Samsung SM3. File:Nissan Almera Classic 01.jpg  Nissan Almera (B10, 2006–2010) File:Nissan Almera Classic 02.jpg  Nissan Almera (B10, 2006–2010)  Third generation (N17; 2011)  Rear view In October 2011, Nissan launched a new model as the economical saloon car for the Eco-Car project in Thailand, which was named Nissan Almera. The car is a rebadged version of the Nissan Latio (N17), which is based on the company's global V platform. It is equipped with the same 1.2-litre petrol engine (HR12DE) as the Nissan March and has either a five- speed manual or a CVT transmission. A four-speed conventional automatic transmission is also available in some markets. The name is also used for the car in Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore (and other Asian countries, Australia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa, and Nigeria. In 2013, Nissan launched the Latio as the Almera in the Philippines and Malaysia. In Mexico, the previous-generation Versa was renamed \\"Nissan V-Drive\\" to avoid confusion with the new-generation Versa launched in October, and drops the Sense and Advance trim lines. The third generation Nissan Almera has been assembled in numerous American, African, and Asian countries.  Fourth generation (N18; 2019)  The fourth generation Almera was unveiled on 12 April 2019 at the Rock the Ocean's Tortuga Music Festival in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States, as the third generation Versa sedan, one week before its public debut at the 2019 New York International Auto Show.https://www.motor1.com/news/344275/2020-nissan-versa-debut/ Sales began in August 2019, for the 2020 model year. It is still based on the Nissan V platform, which is shared with the fifth generation Micra. In the United States, the third generation Versa is available in three trim levels: S, SV and SR. The new Versa will include the Nissan Safety Shield of driver assistance technologies as standard equipment, as well as a push-button ignition, a seven-inch, touchscreen audio system, a cruise control, and power windows and door locks. Up-level Versa trims offer features such as aluminum- alloy wheels, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a TFT LCD instrument cluster display screen, LED daytime running accent lamps (DRL's), the Nissan Intelligent Key system, and combination Primatex (leatherette) and cloth seating surfaces. The third generation Versa sedan came to the Mexican market on 1 October 2019 with prices coming between MXN$239,900 and MXN$322,500. It comes in four trim lines: Sense, Advance, Exclusive, and Platinum.https://www.motorpasion.com.mx/industria/nissan-versa-2020-precios- versiones-equipamiento-mexico The previous-generation Versa will still be on sale in Mexico, although with less trim lines than its new generation, and will be named V-Drive.https://www.motorpasion.com.mx/industria/nissan-versa- anterior-se-mantendra-mexico-asi-se-llamara-ahora The fourth generation Almera was launched in Thailand on 14 November 2019https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry- news/turbocharged-2020-nissan-almera-arrives-in-thailand-is-ph-next.html and has also been set for introduction in Malaysia as well.https://paultan.org/2019/04/30/new-n18-nissan-almera-and-kicks-crossover- coming-to-malaysia-in-2020-new-sylphy-also-on-the-cards/ In Thailand, the Almera is offered in 5 trims: S, E, EL, V and VL. All trims are powered by the HRA0 turbocharged 1.0 L engine. The Sunny was also launched in the United Arab Emirates at the Dubai International Motor Show in November 2019. In Brunei, the Almera was officially launched on 27 February 2020. The car is only available with the 1.0-litre turbocharger engine and Xtronic CVT in this market, in two different trims: Turbo (base) and the better equipped Turbo S. 2020 Nissan Versa SV 1.6L, front 2.29.20.jpg2020 Nissan Versa SV (North America) 2020 Nissan Versa SV 1.6L, rear 2.29.20.jpgRear view  Other versions  = G11 (2012–2018) = Nissan Almera (G11, 2012–2018) In Russia, the new Nissan Almera was based on the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy G11 presented in 2005. It received its world premiere at the 2012 Moscow International Automobile Salon on 29 August 2012, and uses the same design as the Bluebird Sylphy but a redesigned dashboard interior, adapted from the first generation Dacia Logan. It has a 1.6-litre petrol engine (75 kW), with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission, and is manufactured locally at the AvtoVAZ plant since December 2012. Sales began in April 2013 and stopped in October 2018.

It is chiefly applied for recreational use, when it is also referred to as alcohol smoking, but it has medical applications for testing on laboratory rats, and treatment of pulmonary edema and viral pneumonia. Recreational use To inhale alcohol, it must be first converted from liquid into gaseous state (vapor) or aerosol (mist). For recreational use, a variety of methods have been invented. Alcohol can be vaporized by pouring it over dry ice in a narrow container and inhaling with a straw. Another method is to pour alcohol in a corked bottle with a pipe, and then use a bicycle pump to make a spray. Alcohol can be vaporized using a simple container and open-flame heater. Medical devices such as asthma nebulizers and inhalers were also reported as means of application. The practice gained popularity in 2004, with marketing of the device dubbed AWOL (Alcohol without liquid), a play on the military term AWOL (Absent Without Leave). AWOL, created by British businessman Dominic Simler, was first introduced in Asia and Europe, and then in United States in August 2004. AWOL was used by nightclubs, at gatherings and parties, and it garnered attraction as a novelty, as people 'enjoyed passing it around in a group'. AWOL was gimmicked as an alcohol \\"vaporizer\\", implying that it would heat the liquid until it entered a gaseous state, but is in fact a nebulizer, a machine that agitates the liquid into an aerosol. AWOL's official website states that \\"AWOL and AWOL 1 are powered by Electrical Air Compressors while AWOL 2 and AWOL 3 are powered by electrical oxygen generators\\", which refer to a couple of mechanisms used by the nebulizer drug delivery device for inhalation. Although the AWOL machine is marketed as having no downsides, such as the lack of calories or hangovers, Amanda Shaffer of Slate describes these claims as \\"dubious at best\\". Although inhaled alcohol does reduce the caloric content, the savings are minimal. After expressed safety and health concerns, sale or use of AWOL machines was banned in a number of American states. The AWOL device was later followed by new products for alcohol inhalation, such as \\"Vaportini\\", created in 2009, which uses simple thermal vaporization. Effects and health concerns There are occupational health and safety risks of inhaling alcohol vapor and mists. Inhalation devices make it \\"substantially easier to overdose on alcohol\\" than drinking, because the alcohol bypasses the stomach and liver and goes directly into the bloodstream, and because the user does not have a reliable way of determining how much alcohol they have taken in. Inhaled alcohol cannot be purged from the body by vomiting, which is the body's main protection against alcohol poisoning. Inhaled alcohol can dry out nasal passages and make them more susceptible to infection. There is also a potential increased risk of addiction. Medical applications Inhalation of vapor obtained by nebulization of water and ethanol in oxygen has been used in treatment of pulmonary edema in humans. Alcohol vapor acts as an anti-foaming agent in the lungs, so the sputum becomes more liquid, and can be easily expelled. The method has also been used to reduce the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in patients who had intestinal tract surgeries. Regulation In the United States, many state legislatures have banned alcohol inhalation machines. Support for such legislation comes from groups fighting underage drinking and drunk driving, including alcohol companies such as Diageo and industry groups such as the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), among others.

He was most notably an explorer of Greenland. Literary expedition With Count Harald Moltke and Knud Rasmussen Mylius-Erichsen formed the Danish Literary Expedition (1902–04) to West Greenland, and in the early stages (1902) discovered near Evighedsfjord two ice-free mountain ranges. Later the party proceeded to Cape York and for 10 months lived native fashion with the Eskimo. The return journey of the expedition to Upernavik across the ice of Melville Bay was the first sledge crossing on record. Denmark expedition As commander of the Denmark Expedition (1906–08) Mylius-Erichsen undertook and carried out the task of exploring and charting the entire coastline of unknown northeast Greenland by three months' field work. The expedition made sledge journeys of more than 4000 miles (6,436 km), exceeding the record of any single Arctic force. The main travel, excluding duplications, of Johan Peter Koch was some 1250 miles (2011 km), and that of Mylius-Erichsen must have exceeded 1000 miles (1609 km). Their explorations showed that Robert Peary's chart of a coast trending southeast from Navy Cliff was radically incorrect. Instead the shore ran to the northeast, adding about 100,000 square miles (259,000 km²) to Greenland and extending it about halfway from Navy Cliff-- where the maps wrongly placed Greenland Sea--to Spitzbergen. Mylius-Erichsen's own exploration disclosed the nonexistence of Peary Channel, and thus established the continuity of Greenland from Cape Farewell, 60° N, to the most northern land ever reached, 83° 39' N. He also discovered and explored the great fiords of Danmark, Hagen, and Brønlund. =Death= Misled by existing maps, Mylius-Erichsen with Niels Peter Høeg Hagen and the Greenlander Jørgen Brønlund so prolonged his journey that a return to the ship that spring was impossible, and they were forced to spend the summer in the area of the Denmark Fjord without the necessary footgear for hunting in the stony area. The need for food for men and dogs forced them to reduce their three dogteams to one. Finally in September they were able to start their return journey on the new frozen sea ice, around the northeastern corner of Greenland. But when they arrived at the southern shore of Mallemuk Mountain, they found open water and were forced to travel inland. En route Mylius-Erichsen and Hagen perished of starvation, exhaustion, and cold walking on the ice of the Nioghalvfjerd Fjord.

It is a concept derived from English common law, whereby a judgment comprises only two elements: ratio decidendi and obiter dicta. For the purposes of judicial precedent, ratio decidendi is binding, whereas obiter dicta are persuasive only. Significance A judicial statement can be ratio decidendi only if it refers to the crucial facts and law of the case. Statements that are not crucial, or which refer to hypothetical facts or to unrelated law issues, are obiter dicta. Obiter dicta (often simply dicta, or obiter) are remarks or observations made by a judge that, although included in the body of the court's opinion, do not form a necessary part of the court's decision. In a court opinion, obiter dicta include, but are not limited to, words \\"introduced by way of illustration, or analogy or argument\\".Black's Law Dictionary p. 967 (5th ed. 1979). Unlike ratio decidendi, obiter dicta are not the subject of the judicial decision, even if they happen to be correct statements of law. The so-called Wambaugh's Inversion Test provides that to determine whether a judicial statement is ratio or obiter, you should invert the argument, that is to say, ask whether the decision would have been different, had the statement been omitted. If so, the statement is crucial and is ratio; whereas if it is not crucial, it is obiter. If a court rules that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a case (or dismisses the case on a technicality), but still goes on to offer opinions on the merits of the case, such opinions may constitute obiter dicta. Other instances of obiter dicta may occur where a judge makes an aside to provide context for the opinion, or makes a thorough exploration of a relevant area of law. If a judge, by way of illumination, provides a hypothetical example, this would be obiter even if relevant because it would not be on the facts of the case, as in the Carlill case (below). University of Florida scholars Teresa Reid-Rambo and Leanne Pflaum explain the process by which obiter dicta may become binding. They write that:Reid-Rambo, Teresa, and Leanne J. Pflaum. \\"Chapter 5: Sources of Law; Reading and Interpreting Cases.\\" Legal Writing by Design: A Guide to Great Briefs and Memos. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic, 2013. 85. Print. In the UK Under the doctrine of stare decisis, statements constituting obiter dicta are not binding, although in some jurisdictions, such as England and Wales, they can be strongly persuasive. For instance, in the High Trees case,Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [1947] KB 130 Mr Justice Denning was not content merely to grant the landlord's claim, but added that had the landlord sought to recover the back rent from the war years, equity would have estopped him from doing so. Given that the landlord did not wish to recover any back rent, Denning's addition was clearly obiter, yet this statement became the basis for the modern revival of promissory estoppel. Similarly, in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd,Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 the House of Lords held, obiter, that negligent misstatement could give rise to a claim for pure economic loss, even though, on the facts, a disclaimer was effective in quashing any claim. Also, in Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd,Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd [1961] UKHL 4, [1962] AC 446 Lord Reid proposed that while doctrine of privity of contract prevented the stevedores in this instance from benefiting from protection of an exemption clause, in future such protection could be effective if four guidelines (which he went on to list) were all met. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball CompanyCarlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 2 QB 256Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1892] EWCA Civ 1 (a case whether a woman who had used a smoke ball as prescribed could claim the advertised reward after catching influenza), Bowen LJ said: In the US Obiter dicta can be influential. One example in United States Supreme Court history is the 1886 case Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.. A passing remark from Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite, recorded by the court reporter before oral argument, now forms the basis for the doctrine that juristic persons are entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not Chief Justice Waite's remark constitutes binding precedent is arguable, but subsequent rulings treat it as such. In other instances, obiter dicta can suggest an interpretation of law that has no bearing on the case at hand but might be useful in future cases. The most notable instance of such an occurrence is the history of the famous Footnote 4 to United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938), which, while rejecting use of the Due Process Clause to block most legislation, suggested that the clause might be applied to strike down legislation dealing with questions of \\"fundamental right\\". This obiter dictum is generally considered to have led to the doctrine of strict scrutiny (and subsequently intermediate scrutiny) in racial-, religious-, and sexual-discrimination cases, first articulated in Korematsu v. United States (1944). The judgment of Korematsu v. United States was itself condemned by the same court in obiter dictum in Trump v. Hawaii (2018). Dissenting judgments or opinions The arguments and reasoning of a dissenting judgment (as that term is used in the United Kingdom and Australia) or dissenting opinion (the term used in courts in the United States) also constitute obiter dicta. These, however, might also be cited should a court determine that its previous decision was in error, as when the United States Supreme Court cited Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s dissent in Hammer v. Dagenhart when it overturned Hammer in United States v. Darby Lumber Co. In Shaw v DPP [1962]Shaw v DPP [1962] AC 220 House of Lords a publisher of the Ladies Directory (a guide to London prostitutes) was convicted of \\"conspiracy to corrupt public morals\\". He appealed on the grounds that no such offence existed. The House of Lords dismissed the appeal, in effect creating a new crime. Viscount Simonds said: \\"...there remains in the Courts of Law a residual power ... to conserve the moral welfare of the State, and ... guard it against attacks which may be the more insidious because they are novel and unprepared for.\\" In a dissenting judgment, Lord Reid said: \\"Parliament is the proper place, ... to [create new criminal laws]. Where Parliament fears to tread it is not for the courts to rush in.\\" Subsequently, Lord Reid was the leading judge in Knuller v. DPP,Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd. v. DPP [1973] A.C. 435 at 456, 56 Cr.App.R. 633 at 637 a case on obscene libel in which a publisher was charged with \\"conspiracy to corrupt public morals\\". In this case, Lord Reid said he still disagreed with the majority decision in Shaw, but in the interests of certainty he would not overturn Shaw.  Semble  Akin to obiter is the concept of semble (Norman French for \\"it seems\\"). In Simpkins v Pays (1955),'Simpkins v Pays' [1955] 1 WLR 975 Queen's Bench Division a grandmother, granddaughter and a lodger entered into weekly competitions in the Sunday Empire News. Each week, all three women together made a forecast and each contributed to the cost of entry; but it was the grandmother's name that was on the coupon. The grandmother received £750 in prize money and refused to share it with the other two. The lodger successfully sued for one third of the prize money; but Sellers J added semble that the granddaughter should also get £250, even though she had not been a party to the action.

Born in Pittsburg, Kansas, Myers was raised in Oklahoma where his father taught at the University of Tulsa. Myers was interested in cartooning from an early age. After his first strip submission for syndication failed, he began working for Hallmark Cards in Kansas City, MO in 1960 as an illustrator of greeting cards. He continued to submit comic strip concepts for syndication in his free time. Broom-Hilda The idea for Broom-Hilda originally came from writer Elliott Caplin, brother of cartoonist Al Capp, who described the character to Myers. Myers designed the characters and wrote the scripts. Caplin acted as Myers' business agent and submitted Broom-Hilda to the Chicago Tribune Syndicate where it was accepted. The first strip was published on 19 April 1970. Personal Russell and Marina Myers married in 1964 and lived in the Kansas City area until moving near Medford, Oregon.

At the last UK census there were 935 homes in the village, well over 10% of which were multimillion-pound properties,HM Government UK Census - 1991 Public Data and is known for its footballers and successful businessmen and businesswomen.  Location and boundaries  Little Aston is located in the very south of Staffordshire. Although it is within the district authority of Lichfield, residents consider themselves part of The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield settlement, on historical grounds and as it is the nearest town away, rather than part of Lichfield which is through open countryside. Little Aston Sewage Treatment Works in the north Little Aston is contained within four corners, formed by local landmarks: Blake Street Station rail bridge in the east, by Little Aston Golf Club's grounds to the west, the Little Aston Severn Trent sewage treatment works to the north and the Rosemary Hill Road/Thornhill Road traffic island in the south. At the south is the Sutton Park, with over of wild grasslands, forested areas, lakes and wild ponies, all accessible though the bordering Streetly Gate. In the north is the Little Aston Recreation Ground, winner of the 2015 Most Improved Fields in Trust Award. This community funded play field with over 3000 trees serves as a community hub with annual events. Little Aston is twinned with the French village of St. Georges sur Baulche in the Burgundy region, south-east of Paris and from Little Aston.

Residences  Little Aston's small community is divided between nine main areas: Little Aston Park, Claverdon Park, Rosemary Hill Road, Little Aston Lane, Forge Lane, Walsall Road, Aldridge Road, Little Aston Hall and Lady Aston Park. =Little Aston Park= St Peters Chuch Located in the south of the village is Little Aston Park. Often referred to as \\"Millionaire's Row\\" Birmingham Mail Newspaper - 27 July 2006 \\\\- with Roman Road being the most expensive street in Staffordshire - it is a private estate with no public right of way over any of its private roads or grounds, consisting of around 100 unique, architect- designed houses and includes Birmingham's most expensive house ever sold at £7.5 million. It also contains one of the village's championship golf clubs, Little Aston Golf Club, and St.Peter's Church. The park is located in a woodland setting around the historic rhododendron-lined Roman Road which closely follows path of the ancient Roman Icknield Street. Grade II listed electric automated gates Its private roads and gated entrances are maintained by LAPRA Limited (Little Aston Park Residents Association), to which home- owners contribute. Alternatively some of the private roads have their own residents associations allowing them to maintain their own roadways, gates and CCTV systems. To ensure only high standards of development, Lichfield Council requires \\"for properties to be very large and detached, set down long driveways with significant screening and landscaping between neighbouring properties\\", and has designated the area the Little Aston Park Conservation Area. In addition, the non-developed borders to the park are protected by being designated as green belt land. An application for planning permission for perimeter gates around the private estate was recently at a Lichfield Council Planning Committee meeting, and subsequent Planning Inspectorate Appeal Dismissed, as to create a large gated community would undermine social cohesion by creating social segregation, impact highway safety and slow access to emergency services - the issue deeply divided property owners with 79 residents objecting and 57 supporting. Some residents had argued that there had been a recent murder of one of the residents in his home and a drive by shooting. Other residents had pointed out that the newly appointed management company had not informed residents of the proposals - which all residents were expected to pay for at great cost - overstepping their authority, and problems with the estate were internal not external, such as excessive professional and management fees of £22,000 a year for the new management company (resulting in Lapra Ltd having to double residents' yearly contributions) - compared to previous years where a volunteer management committee of residents oversaw the estate's maintenance allowing all residents' funds to be spent on actual maintenance and security. =Claverdon Park= Claverdon Park is a private estate consisting of 82 large detached houses and bungalows. It is accessible only through the Little Aston Park's private road and gate network. Whilst often confused as being part of the Little Aston Park, it is in fact a separate entity managed by Claverdon Park Management Company Limited. Claverdon Park is not subject to the same high standards of development and woodland setting as its neighbouring Little Aston Park is, and is not part of Lichfield Council's designated Little Aston Park Conservation Area. Roads within Claverdon Park are: Claverdon Drive, Stonehouse Drive, Roman Lane, Roman Park, Barns Croft and Alderhithe Grove. =Rosemary Hill Road= Rosemary Hill Road is a public road with many private gated driveways leading off the highway and gated houses alongside, particularly on the more exclusive Lichfield District side which borders the Little Aston Park. The west side of road is part of Little Aston (Lichfield) and the east side is in Four Oaks (Birmingham). =Little Aston Lane= At the heart of the village is Little Aston Lane. Running opposite expanses of fields and the grounds of Aston Wood golf course, the lane consists of around 50 large, detached houses. A recently constructed, landscaped recreation area also runs parallel to the lane, managed by the Little Aston Recreational Ground Association. In addition to the lane's own housing, it also contains the entrance to The Grove. A cul-de- sac within Little Aston Lane, The Grove contains 51 large, detached homes, similar to those on the lane itself. The Little Aston Village Hall, is also on the lane, providing services and facilities to the small community. A crown green bowling club and a tennis club are on the Hall site. Many residents have complained to the local MP and county council regarding excessive use of the village roads by HGV tippers and artics, exposing young children walking to school to great risk. There is a bizarre situation where there is a 7.5-tonne weight limit in one direction of the road, but not in the other, and Staffordshire County Council's explanation that imposing the limit in both directions would burden the neighbouring Birmingham Council's road network with excessive traffic. =Forge Lane= Forge Lane Running out of the Little Aston Park and into the surrounding countryside is Forge Lane. It is lined by around 40 detached and semi-detached houses, situated on both sides of the road. The village's Little Aston Primary School is located on the lane. Forge lane also contains the entrance to Little Aston's recreation site, a large area of landscaped grassland, popular for dog walking and sports activities. In addition to this, the entrance to Little Aston's vicarage is also in the lane, which has been the home of many of the village's vicars. Forge Lane is a continuation of Roman Road which is directly opposite across Little Aston Road. Roman Road is the old Roman, Ryknild Street part of which can be seen within the confines of Sutton Park which is at the opposite end of Roman Road from Little Aston Village by Rosemary Hill Road. The lane derives its name from the forge mill and adjacent cottages which stood over bourne / footherley brook which can be found further down the lane from the village. The mill and cottages were built around the mid 1600s by Thomas Foley whose name was used for the Foley Public House in Streetly. The mill was initially a hammer mill for iron smelting and ingot production, as the surrounding area has deposits of iron stone which were used in the mill. The mill use was changed sometime in the early 1800s to become a flour mill up until it was destroyed by fire in 1903. The mill cottages remain to this day and are residential homes, with the oak beams used in its construction still in place in the ground floor rooms and upper floor ceilings. The mill pond that lay in front of the cottages which feed the mill wheel is no longer there having been filled in sometime after the first world war, but its outline can be seen within the adjacent Footherley Wood and the small piece of open land beside the bridge over the brook. It has been said but not proved that the fields to the side of the cottages were used by Oliver Cromwell as a camp site on his way north to Chester during the Civil War. The Chester Road being not more than a half a mill from the cottages. The present day Little Aston Primary school which stands on the lane is not more than 100 yards from the former school which are now residential homes but if you inspect the buildings you will see the school boys and girls entrances detailed in the brick work of the buildings. These buildings stand opposite the blacksmiths old forge which is at the top of the lane close to Little Aston Road. The Blacksmiths forge is sometimes thought to have been why the lane was called Forge Lane, this is not correct as it was the forge mill further down the lane that gave rise to the lanes name. The blacksmiths forge was not only a forge but the site of the production and building of horse / farm carts and cart wheels. The blacksmiths forge stopped being used as a forge sometime during the 1950s, but today is back in use as a design studio and bespoke carpentry company. =Walsall Road= Running from the Rosemary Hill traffic junction to Forge Lane, this public road is adjacent to and borders the Little Aston Park. There are around 30 large detached houses on the roadside, and private gated communities such as Beechwood Croft and Woodside Drive where houses are multimillion-pound. =Aldridge Road= Former Ferrari and Maserati dealer Continuing on from Walsall Road, Aldridge Road begins on the junction of Forge Lane and Roman Road ending at the A452 Chester Road. It is lined by around 170 houses both detached and semi detached. At the junction with the Chester Road is the former Evans Halshaw Porsche dealership, which later became a Bentley dealership, then a Ferrari and Maserati dealership, and now is an independent classic car dealer selling 1940s, 50s and 60s vehicles. The majority of Aldridge road borders the northerly side of the Little Aston Golf Club, although it is hidden by trees. A long stream running alongside hole 12 and 13 of the golf course runs underneath a small bridge on Aldridge Road which was struck by lightning in the mid 80's causing the closure of Aldridge Road for many months. The stream runs into Lowlands Wood to the rear of a section of properties on Aldridge Road which is privately owned by one Aldridge Road resident. =Little Aston Hall Estate= This small area of residence is situated within what used to be the grounds of Little Aston Hall. Seven blocks of superior apartments were constructed on the site during the mid-1980s, each containing six luxury living spaces. The complex is set back from the road on a private gated drive and situated in many acres of grassland and landscaped gardens. =Lady Aston Park= Lady Aston Park is a recent development of around 50 gated luxury apartments, aimed exclusively at the over 55s. The community borders the Little Aston Hall development, and is alongside the Bupa care home and private hospital. The estate is managed by the Lady Aston Park Management Co. Ltd which is in the ownership of the apartment owners. Day-to-day management is in the hands of an elected committee of residents.  Administration  = Electoral ward = Little Aston is one of Lichfield's electoral wards, although it is separated from the city by open country and is in Tamworth Parliamentary Constituency. Little Aston's current Member of Parliament is Christopher Pincher. = Parish = St Peter's Church Little Aston was for a long time a part of the parish of Shenstone, until St Peters Church was built at the expense of, and on land donated by, Hon Edward Swynfen Parker Jervis. The new church designed by architect G E Street, was consecrated in 1874.  Recreation and education  Little Aston has two golf clubs: the championship Little Aston Golf Club and the new Aston Wood Golf Club. A private BUPA hospital is located on the former Little Aston Hall's estate and Little Aston also features the Midlands' foremost residential estate, Little Aston Park. Little Aston also has its own primary school, Little Aston Primary School, and next door is the Little Aston Recreation Ground. Located at the village hall is the tennis club and bowling green.  Commerce and transport  Within the boundaries of Little Aston, there is only one independent newsagent, one gourmet butcher and one drink store, all located on Little Aston Lane. However, a wider ranges of local mini-supermarkets, hairdressers, fish and chips shops, restaurants and pubs are available in neighbouring Burnett Road Streetly and The Crown Four Oaks all half a mile (800 m) away, plus a wide range of trendy restaurants and major supermarkets in Mere Green a mile (1.6 km) away. A comprehensive high street is in Sutton Coldfield town centre. Nearby junctions with the A38, M5, M6, M6 Toll and M42 give easy access to the north-east, north-west, south-west and south-east towards London. High speed trains towards Manchester and London are available from Lichfield and Birmingham, with connections available from Blake Street. National Express West Midlands service 6 also runs through Little Aston every 30 minutes between Walsall and Sutton Coldfield via Aldridge and Mere Green.

His main working area was heraldry, yet he also worked as a typeface designer, creating commercial symbols and metal works.Biography of Otto Hupp with images Life and career Hupp was born in Düsseldorf, the fourth of five sons of the engraver Carl Heinrich Hupp. His father made him learn engraving as his profession, and, shortly after finishing his education, he moved to Munich in 1878. Since 1891 till his death Hupp lived in the suburb Oberschleißheim. From the painter Rudolf Seitz he learned many styles of painting, and when he met the architect Gabriel von Seidl he received several contracts to paint wall and ceiling frescos. Hupp's main field of work was heraldry, painting more than 6,000 coats of arms and writing books on heraldry. His Wappen und Siegel der deutschen Städte, Flecken und Dörfer (Coats of Arms and Seals of German Cities, Places and Villages book series was started in 1895, but of the originally ten planned volumes only five were finished. 3,300 of his paintings of coats of arms were published as a collecting set from the coffee company Kaffee HAG from 1913-18 and 1926-38\\\\. This publication helped to make heraldry better known to the general public. Another important heraldic publication by Hupp were the Münchener Kalender (Munich calendar), of which 51 issues were published between 1885 and 1936 (the issue of 1933 was omitted).Wolfgang Hendlmeier. 2-1985.htm Otto Hupp - Kunsthandwerker, Heraldiker, Schriftkünstler. Die deutsche Schrift, issue 2/1985 (#75), pp. 25–29. Besides painting existing coats of arms, he also created many designs for municipalities which were applying for new arms. Possibly his most important coat of arms was the 1923 version for the state of Bavaria, which, however, was replaced with a new version after World War II. Bavarian coat of arms (1923-1950) The first typographic works of Hupp were made in 1883. His first typeface, Neudeutsch, was published in 1899 by Genzsch & Heyse. He created several further typeface later, such as Hupp-Gotisch, Hupp-Fraktur, and Hupp- Antiqua. However, as his typefaces were not designed for standard uses, they did not spread much, and are nowadays mostly forgotten. None of them was ever converted for used in phototypesetting, though they have been made available as digital fonts.Klingspor Museum, Biography with examples Other significant works of Hupp include metal works for Speyer Cathedral in 1904 (which also gained him the title professor in 1906), the cover of an astronomical clock donated to the city of Munich, beer steins, and the company logo of the Spaten brewery. Though Hupp was undoubtedly an artist, he himself did not claim to be one, preferring to say that he was simply using the technique of an artist, but failing to have the creativity of one. The Constance Missal As reference material for his work as a type designer, Hupp collected early books and incunabula (books printed prior to 1501). Around 1880 he purchased a copy of an incunable which came to be known as the Constance Missal or Missale Speciale (five complete or partial copies are known). About 1895 he made a study of the volume and concluded that it had qualities in typography and production which suggested it was earlier than the Gutenberg Bible.See for example: Hupp, Otto: Zum Streit um das Missale speciale Constantiense. Ein dritter Beitrag zur Geschichte der ältesten Druckwerke.Strassburg. Verlag J.H. Ed. Heitz & Mündel. 1917. 142 p. Though he sold his copy, after several decades the argument took hold and by 1940 the Missal was recognized as predating Gutenberg's famous work. In 1954, a copy was sold to the Morgan Library for US$100,000. However, by the early 1960s further research by Allan H. Stevenson using watermark analysis demonstrated it was actually printed 20 years later than Gutenberg's work (in the fall of 1473).

It is uniquely located within the borders of Birmingham, Lichfield and Walsall district authorities, and is part of the West Midlands conurbation. It is adjacent to Sutton Coldfield, New Oscott, Great Barr, Four Oaks, Little Aston and Aldridge. Streetly is a semi- rural district, lying close to many farms and is separated from Walsall by open fields and the North Birmingham green belt. The local area includes Sutton Park of which Streetly has its own dedicated gate. Streetly is part of the Birmingham Metropolitan Area and the Birmingham Urban Area. History Streetly is named after Icknield Street, a Roman road, of which parts can still be found in Sutton Park. Streetly was a rural area of Staffordshire until the 1960s, when the character of the area became suburban due to the mass construction of modern housing in response to the urbanisation of Birmingham. Streetly was in Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District until the creation of the metropolitan West Midlands County in 1974. Education There is one 11–18 secondary school in Streetly, and four primary schools for children aged up to 11 years: * The Streetly Academy * Lindens Primary School * Manor Primary School * St. Annes Roman Catholic Primary School * Blackwood Primary School Since September 1992, pupils transferring from primary schools in Streetly have had the option of transferring to secondary schools in neighbouring Sutton Coldfield (since 1974 part of Birmingham) following that area's reduction in the secondary school age from 12 to 11. Politics As part of the constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills, Streetly's MP is currently Wendy Morton. Streetly has three councillors at Walsall Council, all three are Conservatives - Brian Douglas-Maul, Suky Samra and Sat Johal. Sports In 2011 Streetly Cricket Club's First XI won the Warwickshire Cricket League Premier Division, which enabled them to play in the Birmingham and District Cricket League for the very first time in their history in 2012. In 2017 they won the Birmingham League Division 3 title. Streetly also has a hockey club with four men's and two women's teams, and a lawn bowls club.

Huch, Paul R. Ziegler 1985 Joseph Hume, the People's M.P.: DIANE Publishing. Early life He was born the son of a shipmaster in Montrose, Angus and apprenticed to a local surgeon. Medical career He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and moved to India in 1797. There, he was commissioned as a surgeon to an Army regiment, and was able to take up work as an interpreter and commissary- general due to his knowledge of Indian languages. His knowledge of chemistry helped him provide the administration with a method to recover damp gunpowder in 1802, on the eve of Lord Lake's Maratha war. In 1808, he resigned and returned home with a fortune of about £40,000. Between 1808 and 1811, he travelled around England and Europe and, in 1812, published a blank verse translation of The Inferno. In 1818 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society by virtue of being, according to his nomination citation, \\"well versed in various branches of Useful knowledge and particularly in Chimistry, in various branches of oriental literature and Antiquities\\". Political career In 1812, he purchased a seat in Parliament for Weymouth, Dorset, England, and voted as a Tory. When the parliament was dissolved the patron refused to return his money, and Hume brought an action to recover part of it. Six years later, Hume again entered the House, and made acquaintance with James Mill and the philosophical reformers of the school of Jeremy Bentham. He joined with Francis Place, of Westminster, and other philanthropists, to help improve the condition of the working classes, labouring especially to establish schools for them on the Lancastrian system, and forming savings banks. In 1818, soon after getting married, he was returned to Parliament as member for the Aberdeen Burghs, Borders, Scotland. He was afterwards successively elected for Middlesex, England (1830), Kilkenny, Ireland (1837) and for the Montrose Burghs, Montrose, Scotland (1842), in the service of which constituency he died. Political campaigns A Humebugging attempt to Dissect a Naval Estimate, 1822 thumb From the date of his re-entering Parliament, Hume became the self-appointed guardian of the public purse, by challenging and bringing to a direct vote every single item of public expenditure. In 1820, he secured the appointment of a committee to report on the expense of collecting tax revenue. He was very active and became known as someone who gave Chancellors of the Exchequer no peace. He exercised a check on extravagance, and helped to abolish the sinking fund. It was he who caused the word \\"retrenchment\\" to be added to the Radical programme \\"peace and reform.\\" He carried on a successful warfare against the old anti-trade union combination laws that hampered workmen and favoured masters. He brought about the repeal of the laws prohibiting the export of machinery, and of the act preventing workmen from going abroad. He constantly protested against flogging in the army, the impressment of sailors and imprisonment for debt. The Political Martyrs Monument, Edinburgh In 1837 he initiated a plan for a memorial to the Scottish Political Martyrs.Christina Bewley. Muir of Huntershill/ Oxford University Press. 1981. The monument is in the form of a obelisk of grey-black sandstone blocks, and is inscribed with the names of the five men: *Thomas Muir *Joseph Gerrald *Thomas Fyshe Palmer *William Skirving and *Maurice Margarot On 21 August 1844, 3000 gathered to see Hume lay the monument's foundation stone at the Old Calton Cemetery, Edinburgh. In February 1852, a second monument to the Scottish Political Martyrs, again initiated by Hume, was unveiled at Nunhead Cemetery, London.Wally MacFarlane. \\"The Scottish Martyrs\\", a pamphlet published by the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery. Personal life Hume married Maria Burnley, the daughter of an East India Company director, and had nine children, the eighth of which was Allan Octavian Hume, the notable ornithologist and founder of the Indian National Congress. Death The grave of Joseph Hume, Kensal Green Cemetery He died at his seat, Burnley Hall, Norfolk in 1855 and is buried to the north-east of the main chapel in Kensal Green Cemetery in London next to his good friend William Williams. Legacy A memorial of Hume was published by his son Joseph Hume (London, 1855). Another son, Allan Octavian Hume, a renowned ornithologist, also went into the Indian Civil Service and was involved in much political activism during his career, especially on behalf of India, and founded the Indian National Congress.

From 1950 it has been under the artistic guidance of Rubén Fuentes. The group's musical direction had been the responsibility of Don Jose \\"Pepe\\" Martínez from 1975 to around 2013-14. Now the ensemble is under the direction of Carlos Martínez (ex-director of Mariachi Nuevo Tecalitlan). Members A minimum mariachi group has 2 violins, 2 trumpets, 1 guitarrón, 1 guitar, and 1 vihuela. Complete mariachi groups have a minimum of 12 members with the standard 6 violins, 3 trumpets, 1 guitarrón, 1 guitar and 1 vihuela. A 13th member is often a harp, an extra violin, or an extra guitar. The Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán currently has fourteen members, distributed as follows. * Violins: Carlos Martínez (2014), Daniel Martinez (1985), Andres Gonzalez (2007), Oscar Ortega (2017), Roberto Lopez (2018), Angel Lopez (2018). * Trumpets: Gustavo Alvarado (1990), Luis Fernandez Velasquez (2008), Agustin Sandoval (2019), Alejandro Aguilar (2010) * Guitarrón: Enrique de Santiago (1989) * Guitar: Arturo Vargas (2002), Jonathan Palomar (2017) * Vihuela: Gilberto Aguirre (2013) * Harp: Victor Alvarez (2018) Former Members * Violins: Alberto Alfaro, Manuel Vargas, Jose Martinez, Jose Martinez Jr., Miguel Angel Barron, Osvaldo Mendoza, Ruben Fuentes, Steeven Sandoval, Mario de Santiago, Juan Manuel Viurquiz, Salvador Torres, Heriberto Molina, Juan Pinzon, Jesus Rodriguez de Huizar, * Trumpets: Federico Torres, Rigoberto Mercado, Alejandro Aguilar * Guitarrón: Naty de Santiago * Guitar: Rafael Palomar, Manuel Godina * Vihuela: Victor Cardenas * Harp: Julio Martinez, Arturo Mendoza History The history of Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán is divided into five phases (or generations); the first generation from 1897 to 1930, the second from 1931 to 1949, the third from 1950 to 1993, the fourth from 1994 to 2002 and the fifth since 2003 to date. =1st generation (1897-1930)= The Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán was born in a small city called Tecalitlán, to the south of Jalisco. Founded in 1897 by Don Gaspar Vargas the formation during those years was provided by the guitarra de golpe (or mariachera) played precisely by Don Gaspar, the wooden harp by Manuel Mendoza, and two violins played by Lino Quintero and Refugio Hernandez. The combination of these instruments established the \\"Sonido Tecalitlán\\" which distinguished from the \\"Sonido Cocula\\". (The Mariachi from Cocula utilized the guitarron and the vihuela in place of the harp and the guitarra de golpe aside from the two violins). In 1913, Don Gaspar introduced one trumpet to the group but it was not well accepted and, in later performances, its high-pitched sound was considered annoying. The cornet was replaced by another violin. The group consisted then of five elements. The son of Don Gaspar Vargas, Silvestre Vargas, joined as a violinist in 1921. From 1926 the group consisted of Gaspar Vargas - Guitarra de golpe, Manuel Mendoza - Harp, Silvestre Vargas, Trinidad Olivera and Nicolas Torres - Violins. =2nd generation (1931-1949)= Mariachi Vargas in 1932 In 1931 Gaspar Vargas turned the leadership of Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán over to his son, Silvestre. As the first step in his reorganization Silvestre decided to enlarge the group to eight musicians. He invited his compatriots, the Quintero brothers, Rafael and Jeronimo to join. One played a violin and the other a guitar. Later he would add another violin played by Santiago Torres. He moved Trinidad Olivera from the violin to the guitarron, although still preserving the wooden harp. It was Silvestre who possessed a dream that his group would one day be the greatest mariachi in all Mexico and he was relentless in his pursuit of fulfilling that dream. The Mariachi Vargas was something of an oddity in the early 1930s; the members were all dressed in charro suits, they showed up on time for performances, and they were sober. Mexico City In 1933 they won first place in a Mariachi contest celebrated in Guadalajara. Then again, in Mexico City, in 1934, they were awarded another first place prize. President Lázaro Cárdenas, who enjoyed the music of \\"Vargas\\", subsequently had the group hired as the official mariachi of the Mexico City Police Department and the group moved to Mexico City where they remained for 20 years. They provided music and entertainment for the capital city at its parks and gardens. Beginning in 1937, the Mariachi Vargas appeared in \\"Asi es mi Tierra\\", the first of its more than 200 motion pictures. They played in many of Pedro Infante's movies as well. In that same year they recorded their first record and signed an exclusive contract with RCA. Addition of the trumpet and violin In 1941, the group definitively integrated the trumpet into their musical interpretations. Miguel Martínez Domínguez was the first trumpet player for Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán; he is considered the creator of the mariachi-style trumpet as well as its best performer, teacher, and exemplar. In 1944, Rubén Fuentes, a classical violinist with no background in mariachi music, was asked by Silvestre to join the group. Fuentes joined as a violinist and took over as music arranger. Silvestre Vargas and Ruben Fuentes reorganized Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán and changed the group's sound. To overcome the unsavory connotations that the term \\"mariachis\\" had for the public in those days, the two leaders also updated the group's image by demanding professional presentation. =3rd generation (1950-1993)= Mariachi Vargas in 1950 Unifying the sound Fuentes took complete responsibility for the group's musical direction, and enriched the evolution that for many years had conserved the primitive and unstudied qualities of mariachi. The changing sound of the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán was redirected without the abandonment of its roots or traditions. The Huapangos and Sones (which were two very distinctive styles of the mariachi music) were being interpreted in many diverse and different ways. The Mariachi Vargas recorded the Sones with arrangements and adaptations as patterns for other groups. This stratagem promoted the concept that all mariachi groups could be unified to those versions by taking them as examples. The traditional songs and the original sound of the mariachi began to mature in the 1950s. It was during the recordings of the \\"Golden Age of the Huapangos\\" that the compositions, arrangements and musical direction of Rubén Fuentes, and the unequaled voice of Miguel Aceves Mejía, initiated a musical shift that would change the sound and instrumentation of the mariachi. Due to the fact they change mariachi from the start they choose to keep it in away that it would still be traditional. Revolutionary new harmony  In 1955 Rubén Fuentes stopped performing in the group. However, to date he maintains his position as producer, musical arranger and musical director, assisted during this first age by Jesús Rodríguez de Hijar and, under both, the administrative and leadership skills of Silvestre Vargas. In 1966 Rubén Fuentes wrote \\"La Bikina\\", a song that was recognized as the epitome of this Revolutionary New Harmony and sound of the mariachi. He continues to write and produce music for Mariachi Vargas that takes is an emotional roller coaster from the height of happiness to the despair of a broken heart or a lost love. As much in Mexico as in foreign countries the Sones and Huapangos acquire new directions. Mariachi conferences In the 1970s interest in mariachi music was waning. But all that changed when San Antonio, Texas held its first international mariachi conference in September 1979. In 1975, Jose \\"Pepe\\" Martinez, Sr. became the musical director of Mariachi Vargas. He wrote many arrangements including \\"Violin Huapango\\" which individually showcase the different instruments and members in the group. In 1983, the Mariachi Vargas appeared for the first time at the Tucson International Mariachi Conference. A new movement began to grow and many other conferences began to develop. The Mariachi Vargas was often chosen as the headline performer. Linda Ronstadt In 1986, Linda Ronstadt appeared with the Mariachi Vargas at the Tucson International Mariachi Conference where she sang publicly in Spanish for the first time. In 1987 she released her \\"Canciones de mi Padre\\" album featuring Mariachi Vargas which won her a Grammy award for the album. She also went on a national tour with the group, giving greater international exposure to mariachi music than ever before and creating a new audience for mariachi music among non- Hispanics. Classical mariachi In 1989, the Mariachi Vargas released their \\"En Concierto\\" CD featuring some of the greatest renderings of classical music ever played by a mariachi group. They also accompanied Lucero in the 1990s as she rose in the ranks of contemporary musical stardom. The Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán initiated a series of solo recordings: Sones, Valses, Pasos Dobles, Bailes Regionales, Polkas, Clasico e International, etc. They have added more than 50 recordings of mariachi music interpreted by what has become \\"The Best Mariachi in the World.\\" =4th generation (1994-2002)= It is known by all mariachi lovers that this generation was the most talented group of musicians performing since 100 years of their foundation. In their album \\"La fiesta del Mariachi\\", Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán, fourth generation, the group integrates to make a tribute to Jose \\"Pepe\\" Martínez, who besides his magnificent musical arrangements and direction of the group, inspired many as a composer. Their recordings on Polygram with this generation include are, \\"El Mariachi Vargas\\", \\"En Concierto\\", \\"Los sones Reyes\\", \\"La fiesta del Mariachi\\" and \\"50 anniversary of Rubén Fuentes\\". Rubén Fuentes's arrangements and music with the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán are the first five recordings for the one-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of \\"Vargas\\" in 1997. =5th generation (2003–present)= In 2003 Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán began its fifth generation. Their latest recordings are, \\"5ta Generacion\\", \\"Sinfonico I\\", \\"Sinfonico II\\", and \\"Penas, Desengaños... Y Amores\\". Today the group is composed of one harp, one vihuela, one guitar, one guitarron, three trumpets and six violins. With the added instruments, a new sound has emerged that crosses all international borders. The music they play now ranges from the traditional sones to classical works as well as popurris that continue to delight audiences everywhere. In the 100 years since its foundation, the group has gone through some major changes. While there has been some departure from the tradition during that time, the group has maintained its roots through the playing of traditional Mexican sones. In 1997, \\"Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán\\" celebrated its first One Hundred years of foundation.One of the most popular writers was Mario Vargas. Discography From 1937 until now (2009), the Mariachi Vargas has produced over 50 recordings, whose contents are Huastecos sones, waltzes, popurris, polkas, huapango, cumbias, among others. * Danzones (1964 RCA) *Mariachi *Colección Original (BMG Latin, 1999) –This is a recording recompilation made while 1958-1968 -. *Lo Mejor de lo Mejor (BMG Latin, 2000) –This is a recording recompilation made while 1958-1967 -. *Tradicionales de México Lindo Y Querido (LIDERES, 2001). *Sinfónico With Orquesta Filarmónica del Estado de Querétaro (2001) –Directed by Maestro José Guadalupe Flores-. *5ta.

He described himself as \\"a Tory in the old tradition\\". Early life Algie was born on 22 October 1888, in Wyndham, a small town in New Zealand's Southland Region. He was educated at Arrowtown, Thames High School and Balclutha District High School before attending Auckland University College. He gained an LLB in 1913 and an LLM in 1915. In 1920, aged 31, he became the first professor of law at Auckland University College. He was noted for his strong intellectual performance, and also for his conservative views. On 4 December 1917 at St Mary's pro-Cathedral, Parnell, Algie married Helen Adair McMaster, a prominent alpinist whose climbs included an ascent of Aoraki / Mount Cook. Member of Parliament In 1937, Algie became the director of the Freedom Association, an organisation which strongly opposed the left-wing Labour Party government of the time. The Freedom Association quickly became linked to the new National Party, and Algie became one of the party's more prominent supporters. In the 1943 elections, Algie was selected as the National Party's candidate for the electorate, controversially displacing sitting National MP Bill Endean. Algie won the seat and entered Parliament. Algie proved to be a skilled Parliamentary debater, and has been described by Hugh Templeton as the best debater of his time. Even opponents such as Bob Semple respected Algie's rhetorical abilities. He was also noted for remaining polite throughout debates, and for his willingness to apologise for any offence he accidentally gave. =Cabinet minister= After the 1949 election, when Sidney Holland formed the first National government, Algie was immediately elevated to Cabinet. He was initially appointed Minister of Education, and later became Minister of Broadcasting and Minister of Scientific and Industrial Research. He also co-led the committee that looked into the future of the Legislative Council, the upper house of the New Zealand Parliament, which was abolished from 1951. In the end, however, Algie's proposals for a Senate were not pursued, and New Zealand's parliament has not had an upper house since that time. =Speaker of the House= Algie briefly returned to Opposition after the 1957 election, which National lost. When National regained power after the 1960 election, Algie is believed to have wanted the post of Minister of External Affairs, but was not given it (possibly because of his age; he was seventy-two). Instead, he was convinced to take up the Speakership. He officially assumed office at the beginning of the 1961 parliamentary term. As Speaker, Algie was known for his strong insistence on politeness in debates. He also undertook a number of reforms of Parliamentary procedure to accommodate the changing nature of politics. He served six years as Speaker, retiring at the 1966 election. He was generally praised for his performance in the role and in the 1964 Queen's Birthday Honours Algie was appointed a Knight Bachelor.\\"Birthday Honours\\" (18 June 1964) 37 New Zealand Gazette 995.

Its aim is to provide a characterization of the conceptual elements by which a person understands words and sentences, and thus to provide an explanatory semantic representation (title of a Jackendoff 1976 paper). Explanatory in this sense refers to the ability of a given linguistic theory to describe how a component of language is acquired by a child (as proposed by Noam Chomsky; see Levels of adequacy). Recently, conceptual semantics in particular, and lexical semantics in general, have taken on increasing importance in linguistics and psycholinguistics. Many contemporary theories of syntax (how sentences are constructed from individual words) rely on elements that are idiosyncratic to words themselves. As a result, a sound theory accounting for the properties of the meanings of words is required. Meaning and decomposition Jackendoff has claimed that the goal of conceptual semantics is to investigate: Conceptual semantics distinguishes a single, universal meaning to a word. Instead of having a lexical semantic meaning in addition to the conceptual representation of the actual referent, here the two are combined into what Jackendoff calls \\"lexical concepts\\" (Murphy 2010:59). Conceptual semantics is considered to be not just a linguistic theory, but a theory on human cognition. Like many semantic theories, Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptualization. Just as one of the ways a physical scientist tries to understand matter is by breaking it down into progressively smaller parts, so a scientific study of conceptualization proceeds by breaking down, or decomposing, meanings into smaller parts. However, this decomposition cannot go on forever, for at some point, meanings can no longer be broken down. This is the level of conceptual structure, the level of mental representations which encode the human understanding of the world, containing the primitive conceptual elements out of which meanings are built, plus their rules of combination. Conceptual semantics does not work with a mental dictionary, in the classical sense. There are no definitions attached to concepts and reference, only the idea of the concept or reference itself. Just as generative syntax posits a finite set of syntactic categories and rules for combining them, so, too, does Conceptual Semantics posit 'a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination' governing their interaction (Jackendoff 1990: 9). Jackendoff refers to this set of primitives and the rules governing them as the 'grammar of sentential concepts' (Jackendoff 1990: 9). His starting point is a close analysis of the meanings of lexemes dedicated to bringing out parallelisms and contrasts which reveal the nature of the conceptual structures underlying them. Jackendoff considers the lexicon to be made of three parts: phonological, syntactic, and conceptual. These three aspects of a concept give a \\"full picture of a word\\" (Murphy 2010:60). What his method shows, he says, is that the psychological organization on which meaning rests 'lies a very short distance below the surface of everyday lexical items – and that progress can be made in exploring it' (1991: 44). Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptual structure, in which the concepts underlying word meaning are broken down into their smallest elements: conceptual primitives envisaged as the semantic equivalents of phonological features. Conceptual Semantics posits 'a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination' governing their interaction. The conceptual structure of a lexical item is an element with zero or more open argument slots, which are filled by the syntactic complements of the lexical item.  Semantic structures  Conceptual semantics breaks lexical concepts up into ontological categories: events, states, places, amounts, things, and property, to name a few. These ontological categories are called semantic primes, or semantic primitives. Jackendoff poses that any concept in the human brain can be expressed using these semantic primes. Conceptual semantics is compositional, in that the meanings of phrases, clauses, and sentences can be determined from the lexical concepts that make them up. (Murphy 2010:66) Problems Jackendoff's system has been criticised for its highly abstract primitives, which linguists such as Wierzbicka (2007a, 2007b) and Goddard (1998, 2001) have called \\"obscure\\". The main reason for this is because one requires special training to understand them, and they often must be translated into plain English to be communicated. Another criticism often raised against conceptual semantics is that it is arbitrary. In its current state, there are no clear procedures for determining when a primitive is justified. Another criticism Wierzbicka and Goddard have raised is that the theory was formulated around and applied only to English, though it claims to be universal.

RDS-ALERT: a DRIVE project to develop a proposed standard for the Traffic Message Channel feature of the radio data system RDS, IEE Colloquium on 'The Car and its Environment – What DRIVE and PROMETHEUS Have to Offer (Digest No.20), 1990. An initial proposal for defining RDS-TMC data fields had been made to the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) in Madrid, based on a scheme developed by CCETT and Philips in the Eureka-sponsored CARMINAT research project.CARMINAT, Programme EUREKA (EU 55) : Realisation d'un système complet d'information, de géstion et de navigation à vocation Européenne pour les véhicules routiers [CARMINAT, EUREKA Programme (EU 55) : Development of a complete European information management and navigation system for road vehicles.] International Road and Traffic Conference. Roads and Traffic 2000. Vol. 1., p. 147-150. Text in French with summary in English. Coordinated by: Heusch/Boesefeldt G.m.b.H., Aachen Germany. Publication Date: 1988. This proposal required the use of at least two 104-bit RDS data groups for each message. Within these RDS Groups, 32 bits per group would be used for traffic data, giving a total traffic message length of 64 bits. A second proposal, by Bosch-Blaupunkt and the German Road Research Institute BASt, sought to use just a single RDS Group per traffic message. Then, in 1987, the CEC invited Castle Rock Consultants to lead a joint team that would take TMC development a stage further.J.L. Riley and A.K. McParland. RDS-ALERT: A proposed Traffic Message Channel (TMC) feature for the Radio Data System (RDS). BBC RD 1991/16, Research Department, Engineering Division, The British Broadcasting Corporation. CRC produced a proposal for a modified BASt/Blaupunkt single group message definition, which became known as the ALERT A coding scheme. Tests also continued at CCETT and BBC on the CARMINAT approach, which formed the basis of an alternative ALERT B coding proposal. A major question addressed in the Alert A scheme was the total number of traffic event locations to be coded. Initial estimates suggested that, in Europe, a maximum of 65,000 significant junctions might be needed for the Federal Republic of Germany. An efficient coding system would require only 16 bits to code these, simply by numbering each intersection from 1 to 65535. Calculations for France, Britain and elsewhere suggested that around 30,000 to 40,000 locations should be enough for most European national or U.S. statewide systems. A standard 16-bit location code was, therefore, adopted for inter-urban networks. The Madrid proposal of 1987, by comparison, had required 33 bits to code problem location, with separate fields for road number, road class, area of the country, etc. These 33 bits gave a theoretical total of 8.5 billion location codes, most of which could never be used.Peter Davies, Chris Hill, and Grant Klein. Standards for the Radio Data System – Traffic Message Channel. Castle Rock Consultants, Leesburg, Virginia, USA. Vehicles/Highway Automation: Technology and Policy Issues (SP·791). Future Transportation Technology Conference and Exposition, Vancouver, BC, Canada. August 7·10, 1989 After consultation with ECMT, a combined approach was developed called the ALERT C Protocol that aimed to combine the best features of each approach. ALERT A and C replaced the CARMINAT message categories cause, effect and advice by a single 11-bit basic message code. This permits up to 2048 basic message phrases to be broadcast. The new ALERT protocols significantly increased the efficiency of message coding, shortening the basic message content from 18 to 11 bits. In conjunction with the revised location codes, which saved 17 of the 33 bits previously assigned, this allowed the great majority of traffic messages to be broadcast using a single TMC data sequence. In 1991, ECMT recommended moving forward with further testing of the protocols.European Conference of Ministers of Transport.

[CEMT/CM(91)12] The work continued with a larger consortium including Volvo and Ford in the European Commission's DRIVE II project ATT-ALERT.Davies, P.; Milton, H. Castle Rock Consultants, Nottingham, UK. The development of integrated traveller information protocols.Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles '94 Symposium, IEEE, 24-26 Oct. 1994, pages 602-605.  Operation  Each traffic incident is binary-encoded and sent as a TMC message. Each message consists of an event code, location code, expected incident duration, affected extent and other details. The message contains a list of up to 2048 event phrases defined by 11 binary bits (of which 1402 were in use as of 2007) that can be translated by the receiver into the user's language. Some phrases describe individual situations such as a crash, while others cover combinations of events such as construction causing long delays. In Europe, location code tables are maintained on a national level. Those location tables are integrated in the maps provided by in-vehicle navigation system companies such as HERE Technologies and TomTom and by vehicle manufacturers such as Volvo. In other countries, such as the U.S. and Canada, private companies maintain the location tables and market TMC services commercially. Sources of traffic information typically include police, traffic control centers, camera systems, traffic speed detectors, floating car data, winter driving reports and roadwork reports.  Coordination  TMC-Forum, a non-profit organization whose members included service providers, receiver manufacturers, car manufacturers, map vendors, broadcasters (public and private), automobile clubs, and public authorities, was a forum to discuss traffic information related matters. It maintained the TMC-Standard (ISO 14819). On 11 November 2007, the TMC-Forum and the TPEG-Forum merged into the Traveller Information Services Association (TISA). TISA has taken over all of TMC-Forum's activities and responsibilities.  Functionality  RDS-TMC is a low-bandwidth system. Each RDS-TMC traffic message comprises 37 data bits sent at most 1–3 times per second, using a low capacity data channel primarily designed for FM radio station name identification and tuning. Compressing traffic incident descriptions in multiple languages into 16 bits for a location, 11 bits for an event description code, plus 3 bits for the event's extent and a few extra bits for the duration/system management was necessary due to pre-existing constraints in the RDS standard. Almost all the other broadcast data bits were already assigned from each 104-bit RDS Group. A major design challenge of RDS-TMC was to find a way of describing traffic event locations across an entire state or country. Such a system could not convey precise latitude-longitude data (available 25 years later using GPS in applications such as Waze). Instead, RDS-TMC relies on the use of location tables that point only to significant highway junctions. The precision of each traffic event's location is low compared to that of modern smartphone devices. The user's navigation system locates a driver to about 3 metres (10 feet), but only knows, for example, that a crash took place between Exit 3 and Exit 4, northbound on a particular motorway. This limitation requires that traffic events (accidents, congestion, burst water mains, faulty traffic lights, etc.) have to be superimposed onto maps by mapping the reported location to the TMC location table. If the nearest location table point lies at some distance from the exact position of the incident, then the report appears on a section of main road between two junctions instead of at its exact location. The limited precision can make a significant difference as to how navigation devices interpret the incident, potentially leading to an occasional poor route choice. In the US and elsewhere, systems such as CARS (Condition Acquisition and Reporting System)P. Davies, K. Virshbo, Castle Rock Associates, Portland, Oregon, USA. CARS (Condition Acquisition Reporting System) and the CARS Group. Archives of Transport System Telematics, Volume 2, Issue 1, February 2009.Dennis W. Johnson.Congress Online: Bridging the Gap Between Citizens and Their Representatives p41. can pinpoint event locations or their start and end points with one-metre precision. These real-time data are published in XML for access by companies such as Google and TomTom.http://www.iowadot.gov/511/xmlfeed.html These incident reports can be delivered to mobile phones and handheld devices in vehicles. However, major real-world traffic incidents usually spread from hundreds of metres up to many kilometres, once traffic backups have developed. On motorways and other major roads, there are typically few or no detours available between significant junctions, which are all included in the TMC location tables. Many traffic report locations are only approximate, and as queues grow, locations can change swiftly. So GPS-based systems are more precise, but are not necessarily more accurate.  Security  In April 2007, two Italian security researchers presented research about RDS-TMC at the CanSecWest security conference. The presentation, entitled \\"Unusual Car Navigation Tricks\\", raised the point that RDS-TMC is a wireless cleartext protocol and showed how to build a receiver and transmitter with inexpensive electronics capable of injecting false and potentially dangerous messages. Detailed instructions and schematics were published in Issue No. 64 of Phrack hacking magazine. The TMC Forum responded by stating that the effects of any 'pirate' TMC broadcasts would be non- existent on users not on routes affected by fake obstruction messages and that such broadcasts would directly interfere with that country's TMC carrier station, which would lead to criminal or civil liability. They stated that it was therefore unlikely that such activity would take place. Actual RDS-TMC attacks have been known to occur, for instance in Belgium in 2019 where road users were warned of \\"air raids on the E40 road\\" in March and that \\"firefights broke out on the E17\\" in August . Official government advice was to ignore these messages, local police services admitted that locating the source of the transmissions was going to be difficult and that – even though clearly communication laws were broken – arrests or convictions were unlikely. Devices and navigation programs An RDS-TMC receiver is a special FM radio tuner that can decode TMC data. Satellite TMC receivers use a dedicated data channel that is broadcast as part of much larger broadcast digital audio channels. TMC data is decoded by matching event and location codes against look-up tables of phrases and locations. The results can be translated into audio or visually displayed on a Sat nav device. The look-up tables must be implemented in a service-specific database mapped to geographic routes and intersections. As with the navigation systems themselves, periodic upgrades are needed as the road system changes. This provides opportunities for vendors to generate revenue. The technical concepts of RDS-TMC originated about 30 years ago, initially by Blaupunkt and Philips. With European Commission funding, the BBC, Transport Research Laboratory and CCETT came together in a team led by Castle Rock Consultants to develop the standard. More recently, personal navigation devices (PND) have emerged as an alternative way to deliver traffic information via mobile devices employing GPS. Automobile companies continue to roll out RDS-TMC products. One reason is that the use of mobile devices is attracting legislative attention due to concerns about driver distraction. Like car radios, in-vehicle navigation systems have not so far generated the same concerns and may continue to outsell handheld solutions. Higher-end models of personal navigation assistants come with a built-in TMC receiver, and depending on the country, the service is available in Eclipse, Garmin, iPhone (Navigon), Navman, Navway, Mio, Pioneer, TomTom and Uniden navigation systems, as well as in Volvo, BMW and Ford Falcon navigation systems, among many others. TMC adapters can extend mobile navigation systems with integrated GPS receivers with TMC functionality. They can include a bluetooth or USB connection. The adapter passes traffic messages to the navigation software for route calculations. The adapters generally include a connector for FM/TMC, an antenna (2,5mm phone jack or MCX jack 50 Ohm). Compatible navigation programs include AvMap, Destinator PN, Falk Navigator TMC Edition (special version for MyGuide Navigator 6500XL TMC Bundle), GoPal, iGO, Mireo, Navigon MN5, Route 66, and Sygic.  Coverage  In some places, TMC coverage is smaller than that of the radio programme carrying the TMC service, therefore white spots exist. For example, in the US, one of the two TMC commercial services is run by Clear Channel Communications, whose 95 FM station urban markets typically have some level of traffic information service. Another is Sirius Satellite Radio, which covers all of North America, including sparsely-populated rural areas and near-empty deserts. Although vendors are beginning to make arrangements with information systems such as CARS, operated by state police and state departments of transportation, coverage is likely to remain sketchy in some states during the next few years.  TMC services in operation  The following countries provide a TMC service: = Australia = Intelematics Australia broadcasts a national encrypted RDS- TMC service focused initially on urban Australia under the brand 'SUNA Traffic Channel'. The service reaches around 85% of urban Australia, using commercial FM broadcasters in seven cities, as well as via XML for online and smartphone applications. The service is available on GPS navigation systems including Navman, Mio, Uniden, iPhone (Navigon & Sygic), Eclipse, Pioneer, Alpine and Clarion. SUNA Traffic Channel is also available in Ford, Holden, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and many other navigation systems. SUNA is currently the only source of comprehensive, metropolitan congestion monitoring content in Australia – proprietary technology interfaces to traffic light control systems. The SUNA broadcast service is fully compliant with both RDS and TMC. However, since the broadcast is encrypted it does not work on in-car GPS navigation systems that do not have a commercial arrangement with SUNA. = Austria = In Austria, ORF broadcasts a free service on radio channels Ö1, Ö2 (9 regional channels), Hitradio Ö3 and FM4. It is supported by the Federal Ministry for Traffic, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT).

Mediamobile has a traffic information center in Estonia for the Nordic region. = Belgium = Belgium hosts TMC services: TMOBILIS in Belgium, TIC-VL in Flanders and RTBF in Wallonia and Brussels. Except for TMOBILIS, they are all currently open services. TMOBILIS is provided by Be-Mobile and Touring Mobilis. It is the only fully Belgian service. It combines all Belgian sources from the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels government, police stations, a national Floating Car Data system based on GPS positions from vehicles and the Touring Mobilis call center. It is nationally broadcast by both VRT on Studio Brussel for Flanders and RTBF on Classic 21 in Wallonia and Brussels. TIC-VL is broadcast by VRT on Radio 2 and uses content from the Vlaams Verkeerscentrum. Coverage of content and transmissions is limited to Flanders. In Wallonia and Brussels, CLASS.21 is broadcast by RTBF on Classic 21. The service is from the Centre PEREX of the Service public de Wallonie (SPW, formerly MET) in collaboration with TMC4U. Coverage of transmissions and content are limited to Wallonia and Brussels. Technum creates the location tables by order of the regional communities. Since December 2004 broadcast messages use location table version 1.4b, which added N-roads. The latest version is 2.9 (). = Bulgaria = A national TMC service for Bulgaria started beta testing in December 2010. The service is provided by TrafficNav, a Budapest based traffic information company in cooperation with the broadcast hardware manufacturer Kvarta. Data sources include real time traffic information provided by tix.bg, presently for Sofia. The service can be accessed by most Garmin navigation devices and will soon be supported in several factory car navigation devices. = Colombia = Legislation does not allow the insertion of external digital data into analogue FM transmissions and the use of RDS-TMC technology is also banned. = Czech Republic = TMC developments in the Czech Republic are coordinated by CEDA, which is responsible for the location table. Its current version is 4.1, containing more than 16,000 records.

Navigon coming on board shortly thereafter. TMC services in South Africa have been available since late 2009, a service provided by Altech Netstar. In partnership with INRIX, Altech Netstar broadcasts their Premium Traffic Service throughout Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Western Cape Peninsula. The company planned to launch in Orange Free State, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga in 2012. Altech Netstar offers a commercial service to its OEM and Commercial Customers. Altech Netstar broadcasts XML services to their device partners and wholesale customers. = Spain = A TMC service is available in Spain on RNE 3. It is provided by SCT as the operator of traffic management in Catalonia Autonomous Community, DT in the Basque Country Autonomous Community and DGT (Traffic General Directorate) for the rest of the country. Road network coverage is the motorways, national roads and first level roads that belong to the Autonomous Communities. RACC is working on urban services, starting with Seville and Barcelona to broadcast on RNE 2. Location tables are provided by DGT, Dirección General de Tráfico. The current version is 2.1 and contains about 7.750 entries. = Sweden = The most used TMC service in Sweden is run by Mediamobile under the name V-Traffic Premium RDS-TMC. It is a fully encrypted service with focus on congestions, slippery road warnings and other safety related messages for the driver. A public service is available in Sweden. Swedish Transport Administration, or Trafikverket, is responsible for the location tables. Version v2.3 contains about 17337 data points, and covers 1138000 km of the Sweden road network. The public service has not been developed since 2009 when the government decided to stop distribution of end user services. The service will run at least until end 2015. Sweden is divided into 8 broadcasting zones to avoid transmitting traffic information that is not useful at that location. They cover the European, national and major county highways. The service is broadcast on Sveriges Radio P3 radio station and covers 98 percent of Sweden. Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) has an information page for Trafikverket RDS-TMC in Swedish. = Switzerland = A TMC service is available in Switzerland. The broadcaster is SRG SSR idée suisse or Swiss Broadcasting Corporation who transmits TMC on FM chain 1 and FM chain 3 all over Switzerland. * In German speaking areas: Radio SRF 1 (G) / Radio SRF 3 (G) / La 1ère (F) / Rete Uno (I) partly * In French speaking areas: La 1ère (F) / Couleur 3 (F) / DRS 1 (G) / Rete Uno (I) partly * In Italian speaking areas: Rete Uno (I) / Rete Tre (I) / DRS 1 (G) / La 1ère (F) Daughter company Viasuisse operates the service. Location codes are the responsibility of the Swiss Federal Roads Authority FEDRO but B+S Ingenieur (Bundesamt fuer Strassen) distributes the location tables. Version 5.5 contains around 10,000 codes. = Taiwan = The Taiwanese police radio station and Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MOTC) both broadcast RDS-TMC traffic data. It is currently available for TomTom, Garmin, Panasonic, PaPaGo and Mio devices. = Turkey = Turkey has 3 RDS TMC services. 1: HERE (previously NAVTEQ) has the broadest RDS-TMC service in Turkey, covering the largest 11 cities in the country: Istanbul, Ankara, Adana, Bursa, Mersin, Izmir, Eskisehir, Antalya, Konya, Kayseri and Gaziantep. The service was launched in July 2012. 2: TMC service in Turkey has been published by Basarsoft and TrafficNav in 2012. RDS TMC is available only in the cities where the traffic congestions are a big problem for the people. Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya, Bursa are the cities where broadcasting is being done. 3: TMC service in Turkey was published by Be-Mobile and Infotech in 2012. The RDS TMC service is available in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa and Antalya. All 3 Turkish TMC services are paid services and users can have it in Navigation devices. Both PND and Automotive products are using TMC service in Turkey. = United Kingdom = The INRIX provides a commercial TMC service, iTMC in the United Kingdom. It is broadcast nationally on Classic FM and other commercial radio stations. The BBC charter prohibits it from carrying a commercial service. ITIS provides traffic data on RDS-TMC to major automotive companies (BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, Ford, Renault, Jaguar Land Rover and others). The price of the service is included in the price of the car or navigation system. This system uses Floating Vehicle Data, which include positional information from over 160,000 fleet vehicles fitted. The data is complemented by journalistic or \\"Incident\\" data provided by Trafficlink. Trafficlink is owned by ITIS and provides traffic and travel bulletins to BBC Radio and to over 95% of the UK commercial radio stations. Incident data includes road works, accidents and closures. Trafficmaster, a Teletrac Navman brand, operates a national service using local and regional radio broadcaster Global Radio to ensure reception across mainland Britain. This system uses road-side infrastructure to measure vehicle travel time between sensors placed a few miles apart, and uses number plate recognition technology. Data sources used by Teletrac Navman include Floating Vehicle data from fitted telematics devices, 8500 under-road inductance loops, over 1800 CCTV cameras, Congestion Zone charging cameras, Police control rooms plus a proprietary network of ANPR and IR sensors cameras across the road network. Teletrac Navman provide traffic data on RDS-TMC to major automotive OEM brands including VW, Audi, Skoda, Mazda, Chrysler, Honda, Seat and Vauxhall. Teletrac Navman also supply the Department for Transport with historical traffic data for modelling purposes which is used by central and local governments and their sub-contractors when analyzing road network improvement opportunities. Both services maintain their own location tables. The current location table version of ITIS is 5.1. The current location table version of Trafficmaster is 3.1. = United States and Canada = In the United States of America, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio provide TMC service all over the US. Navteq provides traffic data to both providers. Navteq Traffic delivers traffic information and related advertising via RDS and HD signals to navigation devices nationwide. Navteq also provided traffic data sourced from sensors, probes and other technologies in 10+ countries as of December 2009. INRIX, Inc. fuses TMC data with real-time flow information from its crowd-sourced network of floating cars and mobile devices with information from other public and private sources to deliver real-time and predictive traffic information. iHeartMedia and Tele Atlas have a TMC service called Total Traffic Network (TTN), using FM RDS in 77 US cities and three Canadian metropolitan areas. These services are both offered by subscription and were initially available to many in-car navigation units via an expansion module purchased separately. The TomTom RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver acquires information through an FM signal broadcast by Clear Channel's regional providers. By connecting a compatible TomTom navigation device to the RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver, users receive traffic information via the TMC connection. Traffic alerts appear in the traffic bar on the right side of the screen. Tapping the traffic bar reveals further information, such as accident or traffic delays. The RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver is compatible with the TomTom VIA series, GO 920, TomTom GO 720, TomTom ONE XL and TomTom ONE 3rd edition. It integrates RDS-TMC Traffic information with TomTom GO and ONE products. In addition to these after-market services, six major motor manufacturers offer RDS-TMC as standard in their U.S. vehicles, including Volvo and BMW. iBiquity HD Radio provides a TMC service based on RDS-TMC. = Other areas = In the Netherlands, a map of current and planned TMC service is available from the Traffic Message Channel. In Luxembourg, no service is currently planned. A location table for UAE v4.0 has been certified. In Turkey, various location tables are available. In China, investigations are ongoing to choose a technology for its traffic information system. The main candidates are the Japanese system VICS and the European TMC. A TMC Location table version 1.0 has already been certified. Following the advancement of 4G/5G and IoT, China is actively planning in using 5G to broadcast traffic message and Hong Kong is also in the path. Several consultations in ITIS and Electric Vehicle are proceeding in 2019. In Serbia, an RDS-TMC system along A1 highway started in July 2019, however with limitations.

It makes it possible to write a Cocoa application completely in Ruby as well as to write an application that mixes Ruby and Objective-C code. An Apple project called MacRuby was under development to replace RubyCocoa in 2008. A proprietary spin-off called RubyMotion was subsequently released in 2012, available for iOS, macOS and Android. Some useful applications of RubyCocoa are exploration of a Cocoa object's features with irb interactively, prototyping of a Cocoa application, writing a Cocoa application that combines the features of Ruby and Objective-C and wrapping macOS' native GUI for a Ruby script. RubyCocoa is free software, released under both the Ruby License and the LGPL.  History  RubyCocoa was started in 2001 by Hisakuni Fujimoto when he implemented a Ruby extension module to wrap NSObject and NSClassFromString function. Later it was integrated with Project Builder (which later became Xcode). In 2002 the project was registered on SourceForge and the development team began to grow. In 2006 the committers list was first joined by a developer from Apple, Laurent Sansonetti, and then a RubyCocoa presentation was made during WWDC. Apple stated that RubyCocoa will be included and supported in Mac OS X v10.5 “Leopard”. In August 2008, Sansonetti confirmed that MacRuby \\"is supposed to replace RubyCocoa.\\" in the future.  How does the bridge work?  RubyCocoa is sometimes interpreted as a set of bindings to the Cocoa frameworks, which is false. RubyCocoa is a real bridge between the Objective-C and Ruby programming languages. = Lazy class import = RubyCocoa will import the Objective-C classes into the Ruby world on demand. For example, when you access \`OSX::NSTableView\` for the very first time in your code, RubyCocoa will retrieve all the necessary information regarding this class from the Objective-C runtime and create a Ruby class of the same name that will act as a proxy. It will also import in the same way all the inherited classes. = Forwarding messages = As stated earlier, RubyCocoa creates special proxy objects. Every time you send a Ruby message to a proxy object, RubyCocoa will try to forward it to the embedded Objective-C instance, by translating the message name to an Objective-C selector and asking the Objective-C runtime to forward it. If an exception is raised from the Objective-C world, RubyCocoa will convert it to a Ruby exception and forward it to you. RubyCocoa uses the libffi library to call the Objective-C methods implementations. = Automatic method overriding = RubyCocoa makes it easy to override an Objective-C method from Ruby, either in a subclass or directly to the class (as you would do in Objective-C using a category). Once your method is inserted, RubyCocoa will retrieve the signature of the existing Objective-C method and inject a new one to the Objective-C runtime, of the same signature, but which now points to your code. To accomplish this, RubyCocoa uses the libffi library to dynamically create a closure that will call the Ruby method, and just passes a pointer to that new closure to the Objective-C runtime. = Accessing the C bits = Due to the nature of the Objective-C language, you can freely use C from Objective-C code. In order to bridge the relevant C parts of an Objective-C framework, such as C structures, functions, enumerations, constants and more, RubyCocoa relies on the BridgeSupport project. RubyCocoa will interpret at runtime the BridgeSupport files (using the very fast libXML2's xmlTextReader) and accordingly handle their content. It will for instance construct the Ruby proxy classes for the C structures and also create the functions. Note that the costly operations, such as localizing the symbols, are done on demand, and obviously only once. = Format strings = RubyCocoa is able to detect APIs that use format strings, like NSLog or NSString.stringWithFormat, and appropriately convert the variable arguments to the types specified in the format string. = Function pointers = RubyCocoa allows you to pass Ruby \`Proc\` objects as function pointer arguments. It will then use the libffi library to dynamically create a closure and pass it to the underlying function/method.  Creation of Cocoa applications written in Ruby  Installing RubyCocoa also automatically installs the corresponding Xcode templates. This allows developers to select \\"Cocoa-Ruby Application\\" as the Xcode project type and Xcode will generate all necessary files for them.  How to call Objective-C methods from Ruby  To invoke an Objective-C method, you replace each colon in the method name except the last with an underscore. Thus, for example, the NSWindow instance method \`initWithContentRect:styleMask:backing:defer:\` becomes \`initWithContentRect_styleMask_backing_defer\`. All Cocoa classes and functions belong to \`OSX\` module, so for example, the Objective-C code: NSWindow alloc] initWithContentRect:frame styleMask:NSTitledWindowMask backing:NSBackingStoreBuffered defer:NO] will become: OSX::NSWindow.alloc.initWithContentRect_styleMask_backing_defer(frame, OSX::NSTitledWindowMask, OSX::NSBackingStoreBuffered, false) As you can see, this decreases the code readability by rendering Objective-C parameter naming useless. So, there is another convenient way to write the method calls — the \`objc_send\` method, which accepts Ruby symbols as parameter names. For example, the previous code can also be written as: OSX::NSWindow.alloc.objc_send(:initWithContentRect, frame, :styleMask, OSX::NSTitledWindowMask, :backing, OSX::NSBackingStoreBuffered, :defer, false)  Advantages of RubyCocoa  * As Ruby is an interpreted language, there's no need to recompile the application frequently during development. * Some of Ruby's rich features, like built-in regular expression support, make writing the code faster, and also make RubyCocoa an ideal tool for prototyping.  Disadvantages  * Ignoring the speed of the Ruby interpreter, RubyCocoa applications will always be slower than Objective-C/Cocoa applications due to the added overhead of object conversion. * Because Ruby isn't thread-safe, it isn't possible to dispatch multiple native threads to execute RubyCocoa code. Ruby's emulated threads, however, can be used.

Plot summary In the year 2056, time travel has become a practical reality, and the company Time Safari Inc. offers wealthy adventurers the chance to travel back in time to hunt extinct species such as dinosaurs. A hunter named Eckels pays $10,000 to join a hunting party that will travel back 66 million years to the Late Cretaceous period, on a guided safari to kill a Tyrannosaurus rex. As the party waits to depart, they discuss the recent presidential elections in which an apparently fascist candidate, Lyman, has been defeated by his opponent Keith, to the relief of many concerned. When the party arrives in the past, Travis (the hunting guide) and Lesperance (Travis's assistant) warn Eckels and the two other hunters, Billings and Kramer, about the necessity of minimizing the events they change before they go back, since even the smallest alterations to the distant past could snowball into catastrophic changes in history. Travis explains that the hunters are obliged to stay on a levitating path to avoid disrupting the environment, that any deviation will be punished with hefty fines, and that prior to the hunt, Time Safari scouts had been sent back to select and tag their prey, which would have died within minutes anyway, and whose death has been calculated to have minimal effect on the future. Although Eckels is initially excited about the hunt, when the monstrous Tyrannosaurus approaches, he loses his nerve. Travis tells him to go back to the time machine, but Eckels panics, steps off the path and stumbles into the forest. Eckels hears shots, and on his return, he sees that the two guides have killed the dinosaur, and shortly afterward the falling tree that would have killed the T. rex has landed on top of it. Realizing that Eckels has fallen off the path, Travis threatens to leave him in the past unless he removes the bullets from the dinosaur's body, as they cannot be left behind. Eckels obeys, but Travis remains furious, threatening on the return trip to shoot him. Upon returning to 2056, Eckels notices subtle changes: English words are now spelled and spoken strangely, people behave differently, and Eckels discovers that Lyman has won the election instead of Keith. Looking at the mud on his boots, Eckels finds a crushed butterfly, whose death has apparently caused a rift in the timeline that has affected the nature of the alternative present to which the safari has returned. He frantically pleads with Travis to take him back into the past to undo the damage, but Travis had previously explained that the time machine cannot return to any point in time that it has already visited (so as to prevent any paradoxes). Travis raises his gun, and there is \\"a sound of thunder.\\" Adaptations A comic-book version appeared in issue #25 of EC Comics's Weird Science-Fantasy (1954), adapted by Al Feldstein with art by Al Williamson and Angelo Torres. The story was adapted for the first issue of Topp's Publishing's Ray Bradbury Comics (1993) with art by Richard Corben. The story was adapted for the third season of The Ray Bradbury Theater on October 8, 1989, starring Kiel Martin. A film adaptation of the same name starring Ben Kingsley, Edward Burns, and Catherine McCormack was released in 2005. Roger Ebert stated that while he \\"cannot endorse it, [he] can appreciate it\\" as a film that is bad because it \\"want[s] so much to be terrific that [it] explode[s] under the strain.\\" A Game Boy Advance video game based on the film was also released. It was finished in time for the film's planned 2003 release, delayed along with it and ultimately released in February 2005. Planned console ports were cancelled. The story is parodied in the Time and Punishment section of The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\". The story is also parodied in the teaser for the Arthur episode \\"Follow the Bouncing Ball,\\" where Brain leads a tour through the age of dinosaur on a designated time path, only for the group to return to the present as lizard people thanks to Buster leaving behind a box of raisins. The story is also parodied in Time Squad episode \\"Planet of the Flies,\\" when Tuddrussel squashes a fly in the Stone Age causing 1323 England to be attacked by a giant fly (making the Godzilla roar) and the future to be ruled by insectoid flies. Influence \\"A Sound of Thunder\\" is often credited as the origin of the term \\"butterfly effect\\", a concept of chaos theory in which the flapping of a butterfly's wings in one part of the world could create a hurricane on the opposite side of the globe. The term was actually introduced by meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz in the 1960s. However, Bradbury's concept of how the death of a butterfly in the past could have drastic changes in the future is a representation of the butterfly effect, and used as an example of how to consider chaos theory and the physics of time travel. Simulations of time travels in complex systems using a quantum computer show that in quantum mechanics the effect described by Ray Bradbury does not exist.

The program started in 1978 under the title Yoshimune Hyobanki: Abarenbo Shogun (Chronicle in Praise of Yoshimune: The Unfettered Shogun) who went after rogue councillors and daimyō who were abusing their power. After a few seasons, they shortened the first two words and ran for two decades under the shorter title until the series ended in 2003; a two-hour special aired in 2004. The earliest scripts occasionally wove stories around historic events such as the establishment of firefighting companies of commoners in Edo, but eventually the series adopted a routine of strictly fiction. Along with Zenigata Heiji and Mito Kōmon, it ranks among the longest-running series in the jidaigeki genre. Like so many other jidaigeki, it falls in the category of kanzen- chōaku, loosely, \\"rewarding good and punishing evil\\".  Repeating characters  =Regulars= Himeji Castle, used in Abarenbo Shogun in place of Edo Castle Tokugawa Yoshimune :Disguised as Tokuda Shinnosuke—Shin-san to his friends—the third son of a hatamoto, the shogun roams freely about his capital, using the Megumi fire company as his base. The captain of the company knows his identity, but others are unaware that he is the shogun. Yoshimune- as-Shinnosuke is portrayed as the nearly invincible samurai warrior who seldom loses a fight no matter how many enemies opposing him there are. Ōoka Echizen- no-Kami Tadasuke :Like Yoshimune, Tadasuke was a historical personage. Yoshimune appointed him to the position of Minami Machi Bugyō, one of the two chief administrators of Edo. In this office, he was mayor, police chief, judge and jury. He instituted and oversaw the operations of the commoners' fire companies. He also oversaw the Koishikawa \\"City Hospital\\" (Koishikawa Yōjōsho, another Yoshimune innovation). He was aware of Yoshimune's secret activities and originally did not approve, but grew to accept them as necessary and was a loyal accomplice. In the first episode, it was revealed that when he was Yamada Magistrate he had once reprimanded Yoshimune for illegal fishing when the shogun was younger, proving both his integrity and his devotion to the law. :Tadashi Yokouchi played Tadasuke for nearly twenty years; Ryō Tamura replaced him in the closing seasons. Goyō toritsugi :The goyō toritsugi (御用取次) or soba yōnin (側用人) was the person who scheduled appointments for the Shogun. He is generally a man of advanced years. In the first two casts, the character's name was Kanō Gorozaemon (played by comic Ichirō Arishima). Next came Tanokura Magobei (Eiji Funakoshi), and a few followed in the cast changes of the last years of the show. Megumi, Fire company on Abarenbo Shogun Fire captain :Tatsugoro, originally the boss of a construction gang, was the founder of the Megumi fire company and thus reported directly to Tadasuke. In the first episode, it was revealed that he was a former drinking and fighting companion of Yoshimune's before the young lord's elevation to the shogunate. Enka singer Saburō Kitajima played in the series from beginning to end. Although somewhat short-tempered and never one to shun a brawl for a righteous cause, this short, stocky character was altruistic to a fault, stubborn, and fiercely loyal to Yoshimune. :Kitajima also sang the closing theme songs for several years. :Later, Tatsugorō retired from the Megumi and assumed a different occupation; the writers of the series brought in Jōji Yamamoto, another singer (and a disciple of Kitajima) to play Chōjirō, the successor to Tatsugorō. In all, there were three captains during the series. Women of Megumi :Three actresses played Osai, the feisty wife of Tatsugoro. Later, when Tatsugorō left the fire company, the new captain Chōjirō married Obun, the young fishmonger/beat cop. The third captain was unmarried; his widowed sister Okyō was the lady of the Megumi. Firemen :The cast always included half a dozen firefighters (火消 Hikeshi). While the roles were minor, together they were a prominent presence in the series. Character actors and comics played these parts. :The fire companies were named with a single kana such as め followed by the word -gumi. The show featured the Me-gumi, whose auspicious name could also mean \\"blessing\\"; the squad was formed in the third episode \\"The First Fireman's Banner\\". :In the first several years, a retired sumo wrestler named Ryūko was a member of the cast. He played a retired sumo wrestler named Ryūko, who was initially a guest of the captain. He later became a bone-setting doctor, and finally joined the crew of the fire company. Long after leaving the series, he made an appearance as a guest star. Oniwaban (ninja) :The show always had a male and a female oniwaban who acted as both spies and bodyguards for Yoshimune. A few of the actors and actresses have gone on to starring roles in other series. The original female, Osono, was played by Yōko Natsuki. Her successor, Asaka Mayumi, is currently active. In the third series, Reiko Sugano played Hayate; then Takashima Reiko, who has gone on to star in television and film, succeeded her, with the name Kozue. Mayuko Irie (Akane), Akiko Andō (Koyuki), Hitoe Ōtake (Ayame), Chika Kochihira (Satsuki), Kaori Yamaguchi (Nagisa), and Kaori Matsunaga (Azami) followed, with Miki Murai appearing in the final special as Kaede. The men include Sukehachi (portrayed by Hiroshi Miyauchi) and Ōtsuki Hanzō (Shun'ya Wazaki, opposite Osono), the first Saizō (Shigeru Araki, paired with Hayate), Sagenta (Kiyotaka Mitsugi) and the second Saizō (played by Takayuki Godai). Hayami Saheiji (Toshihide Wakamatsu), Jūmonji Hayato, and finally Gorōta followed. Narrator :Genzō Wakayama narrated the show from the first episode to the last. =Semi-regulars= Tokugawa Muneharu (徳川宗春) :The historical Yoshimune came to power when the main line of succession to the Tokugawa shogunate came to an end. He was chosen from the second of the three cadet branches of the Tokugawa clan, and the head of the senior branch, Muneharu, was passed over. The television series frequently presented Muneharu as a rival who tried to assassinate Yoshimune and take over the shogunate. Even when he did not appear, many villains acted in his name, or planned to receive their reward from Muneharu when he became shogun. First played by Akira Nakao and later by Tokuma Nishioka. Yamada Asaemon (山田朝右衛門) : Nicknamed Kubikiri Asa. An executioner for the shogunate, he quits and becomes a rōnin and ally of Yoshimune. Asahi Kurizuka played the role in many episodes. O-Yuri no Kata (お由利の方) : Also known as Jōen'in (浄円院). Yoshimune's mother. Sons of samurai overlords were often separated from their mothers at an early age to develop sternness in them, and Yoshimune was no different. Although Yoshimune offered Oyuri room and board in Edo Castle, she refused, living instead an austere life in a house often seen nearly falling apart. They love each other as an ordinary mother and son, but they conceal their relationship to others as this is part of the Shinnosuke myth used by the Shogun. Played by Tamao Nakamura.  Guest stars  Over the course of a quarter of a century, the show featured a parade of celebrities. Singers, actors, and athletes of all ages played various roles, in some cases including themselves: Ryūko appeared as a guest several years after leaving the regular cast. Hibari Misora, the famous singer, also appeared in the series. Former and future regular characters occasionally made guest appearances. Among the guest stars were the following: * Yoshio Inaba * Hiroyuki Sanada * Tetsuro Tamba * Rika Miura * Nobuo Yana  Stories  The show was frequently topical, and touched on many themes of present-day life, the most common subject being political corruption. Many shows covered include topics of current interest such as drugs, unequal power relationships, poverty, urbanization, the generation gap, yakuza, prostitution, inflation, and the tension between Japanese and foreign knowledge. = Climax = right At the end of about eight hundred episodes, Yoshimune confronts the corrupt official or officials in their safehaven. The official calls his men, but Yoshimune stands firm to reveal and criticize his crimes without hesitation. At first, the official behaves rudely and insultingly as he believes Yoshimune is just a man of low social status, but then after looking closely at Yoshimune's face has a flashback leading him to recognize Yoshimune as Shogun and kneel down in obeisance. However, on hearing Yoshimune's demand that he commit harakiri, he declares Yoshimune to be an impostor and orders his men to kill him. Always outnumbered, Yoshimune ends up easily defeating his attackers with the help of his male and female oniwaban. Using the unsharpened back side of his sword so as to injure without killing the corrupt official, he orders his oniwaban to execute him with the words, sei bai. In the premiere episode \\"The Star of Edo\\", Yoshimune confronts the main villain as himself inside Castle Edo and the villain recognizes him as the hatamoto; after attempting to flee, being disarmed by Yoshimune and surrounded by Yoshimune's ninja and the palace guards, he is allowed to kill himself. = Lines of rebellion = In confronting Yoshimune, the official declares his rebellion with a variety of reasons, including the doubt of the appearance of the Shogun at that place and time or losing his respect to Yoshimune, etc., and it's one of the enjoyable points in the climax. Example: 400px *Sir Tokugawa cannot be here *He is an insolent person calling himself Sir Tokugawa *It's fine if the person were Sir Tokugawa *Everything ends, kill, kill him *Sir Tokugawa, I will fight with you *We lob your life, sir Tokugawa *You are just Shinnosuke Tokuda dying now *I decorate the last minute as an evil (to defeat you) *You are like a moth flying into the flame *Your Highness exists because of us, subordinates' dedication (not because of your ability) *The eighth shogunate will end *Now is the time *Shame on you *Bring his head to our load Muneharu *I have forgotten the face of Sir Tokugawa *There is no reason to obey the order of sir Tokugawa *It is you who cut your own body, not I *We have planned to make you die *You must give up your life *I am a person who should have died at once (so, I'm not afraid if you try to execute me) *If you know the situation completely, in for a penny, in for a pound *How stupid saying who you are, it's the best timing that you show up here (to be killed) Cast * Ken Matsudaira as Tokugawa Yoshimune * Tadashi Yokouchi (first), Ryō Tamura (second) as Ōoka Tadasuke *Megumi ** Saburō Kitajima as Tatsugorō, the first captain ** Masumi Harukawa (first), Yōko Asaji (second), Ryōko Sakaguchi (third) as Osai, wife of Tatsugorō ** Jōji Yamamoto as Chōjirō, the second captain ** Akiko Ikuina as Obun, wife of Chōjirō ** Yūki Matsumura as Eigorō, third captain ** Yōko Ishino as Okyō, sister of Eigorō *Advisors to Yoshimune ** Ichirō Arishima as Kanō Gorozaemon ** Eiji Funakoshi as Tanokura Magobei ** Tadao Takashima as Shishido Kanbei ** Shigeru Kōyama as Yokokawa Kanjūrō *Oniwaban (ninja) ** Hiroshi Miyauchi as Yabuta Sukehachi ** Yōko Natsuki as Osono ** Shigeru Araki as Koba Saizō ** Asaka Mayumi as Sagiri ** Kiyotaka Mitsuki as Sagenta ** Takayuki Godai as Saizō ** Reiko Sugano as Hayate ** Reiko Takashima as Kozue ** Mayuko Irie as Akane ** Tarō Iketani as Kirihara Sasuke ** Toshihide Wakamatsu as Hayami Saheiji ** Akiko Andō as Koyuki ** Takahito Ōmori as Jūmonji Hayato ** Hitoe Ōtake as Ayame ** Chika Kochihira as Satsuki ** Kaori Yamaguchi as Nagisa ** Miki Murai as Kaede * Akira Nakao (first), Tokuma Nishioka (second) as Tokugawa Muneharu * Asahi Kurizuka as Yamada Asaemon * Tamao Nakamura as Oyuri, mother of Yoshimune * Tsukasa Ito as Oyō, intern at the Koishikawa Yōjōsho * Azusa Nakamura as Tsuruhime/Chizuru, love interest of Yoshimune * Megumi Matsushita as Chinatsu, niece of Ōoka Tadasuke  Music  Shunsuke Kikuchi wrote the opening theme, which is popular as a ring tone. He also composed the incidental music. Saburō Kitajima sang the closing theme songs to various series. Late series omitted the closing theme, having instead introductory music by Kikuchi leading into an opening theme song sung by Kitajima. Due to the show's popularity in the Hawaiian islands where a large portion of the population is Japanese, the opening theme has become one of the official sports themes played at University of Hawaii sporting events.  Broadcasts  The original broadcasts were on the TV Asahi network in Japan. The Jidaigeki Senmon Channel has rebroadcast the series on cable and satellite. Also, full English-subtitled programs have been broadcast in Hawaii via KIKU and have become very popular even among younger generations probably due to the large Japanese-American population and heavy Asian influence on modern Hawaiian culture.

A self-titled \\"musician, poet, and media manipulator\\", he is a noted artist across the countries of former Yugoslavia. His songs combine satirical lyrics on human nature and silliness of local politics with a mixture of musical styles including jazz, rock, hip-hop and lately drum and bass, and self-conscious ironic wit; for example, his most popular alias is \\"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Kilo Car\\"— \\"Rambo Amadeus the World Kilo Tzar\\", formerly \\"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Mega Car\\"— \\"Rambo Amadeus the World Mega Tzar\\" (RASMC) (changed in 2012 because of his belief in the importance of modesty in an environmentally conscious society). His stage name itself is made from John Rambo and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. His concerts are never mere repetitions of recorded songs, but a mixture of free improvisation and satirical humor exploiting all aspects of human nature in a crude manner. Some fans compare his style with Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. Rambo Amadeus represented Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the song \\"Euro Neuro\\". Early life Antonije Pušić was born in Kotor, SR Montenegro, SFR Yugoslavia though his family lived in nearby Herceg Novi where he was raised. His writer and painter mother Bosiljka was born in Ćuprija and raised in Jagodina, Serbia before meeting Ilija Pušić from the coastal village of Kumbor near Herceg Novi and moving there upon marrying him. The couple soon moved to Herceg Novi proper and started a family. After completing elementary and secondary education in his hometown, Antonije graduated in tourism studies from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. He also completed six grades of elementary music school for piano before dropping out. Before pursuing music and performing arts as a career choice, Pušić was an accomplished competitive sailor. Between 1972 and 1984, he represented Yugoslavia in numerous international regattas. During this period he was champion of Montenegro several times, an 8-time South-Adriatic champion, national title winner in the junior category, as well as International Đerdap Cup winner in 1980. He still occasionally attends and participates in some recreational sailing regattas in the Gulf of Kotor. He began to sing and compose during first year of high school (gymnasium) which soon led to involvement with various local bands in Herceg Novi and Titograd. One of his first performances saw him play the mandolin in an orchestra that entertained guests of Herceg Novi's Plaza hotel. In 1985, he moved to Belgrade in pursuit of higher education. Parallel to his university studies, he also played with various amateur bands and musicians. Musical career =1970s= In 1979 Rambo Amadeus started off in a band called \\"Radioaktivni otpad,\\" which was short lived. He was also in a band called \\"The Blues Band.\\" He didn't like the content produced, so he rearranged the setup. The band lasted his four high school years. The band played in Herceg Novi, Nikšić and Igalo (5 km distance from Herceg Novi). =1980s= In 1988, he dropped into the music scene out of nowhere with his debut album O tugo jesenja. His sound was a seemingly coarse blend of folkish ululations and opera, further mixed in with humorous lyrics and classic guitar riffs. Since very few people had prior knowledge of him, Rambo was delighted in creating confusion by introducing himself as Nagib Fazlić Nagon, a mine shaft operator who saved up enough money to record an album. He also jokingly referred to his own musical style as turbo folk, long before term would begin to be referred as actually musical style which critics refer to be grave social connotation and become to symbolise the moral and cultural decline throughout the Balkans during the wars of the 1990s. Producer Saša Habić gave Rambo the opportunity to sign for the state television's record company PGP RTB (Rambo later wrote an anecdotal tribute to that event, in the hit song \\"Balkan Boy\\"). Habić also played the synthesiser on this album, from which a track named \\"Vanzemaljac\\" (Extraterrestrial) continues to be popular to this day. The record's sales weren't particularly high, but Rambo created enough of a buzz to remain active on the scene. His next album Hoćemo gusle was released in 1989 and gave a small taste of Rambo's future musical direction – overt political satire. The track \\"Amerika i Engleska (biće zemlja proleterska)\\" was originally supposed to be named \\"Kataklizma komunizma\\" (Cataclysm of Communism) but local authorities did not allow it. The album title pokes fun at a bizarre event from the 1989 protests in Montenegro that eventually grew into the anti- bureaucratic revolution that swept Milo Đukanović, Momir Bulatović, and Svetozar Marović into power. Protesters were heard chanting \\"Hoćemo Ruse\\" (\\"We want the Russians\\"), but when the authorities and state-controlled media criticized them for it, many quickly began backpedaling by claiming they actually chanted \\"Hoćemo gusle\\" (\\"We want gusle\\"). Other songs like \\"Glupi hit\\" and afore mentioned \\"Balkan boy\\" would also become considerable hits and Rambo even received solid critical acclaim for chances he took in \\"Samit u buregdžinici Laibach\\". On that track, he created a catchy hybrid by mixing unique sound of Laibach with lyrics which is borrowed from poetries of Laza Kostić and Desanka Maksimović, as well as from folk kafana standard \\"Čaše lomim\\" mixing with his own humorous lyrics. The album sleeve lists the lyrics of a song that wasn't actually recorded, and explains that \\"it was dropped at the last moment because there was no room for it,\\" but gives assurances that it would appear on the next album. Since the song in question, named \\"Pegepe ertebe,\\" was all about taking shots at Rambo's label PGP RTB, but however, it didn't appear on the next or any other album. =1990s= As the 1990s were beginning, Rambo was growing into an established performer. His third album Psihološko propagandni komplet M-91 came out towards the end of 1991 at a time when breakup of former Yugoslavia was already in full swing. For obvious reasons, the least of which was the album's subtitle – Psychological Propaganda Set, many songs contained heavy lyrics and a dark, militaristic atmosphere. In your face profanity and descriptive cursing was also par for the course, making this the first major music release in former Yugoslavia to take such narrative liberties. Tracks like \\"Smrt popa Mila Jovovića\\" (30-year- old poem by Božo Đuranović), \\"Jemo voli jem\\" (incorporating samples from Yugoslav aviators' anthem \\"Hej vojnici vazduhoplovci\\" as well as Šemsa Suljaković's \\"Izgubila sve sam bitke\\"), \\"Inspektor Nagib\\" and \\"Zdravo damo\\" became instant hits. The discrepancy between what's listed on the cover and what is actually recorded is there again as sleeve announces the track called \\"KPGS\\" which would, this time for real, appear on the next live album, but does not list \\"Halid invalid Hari\\" and \\"Prijatelju, prijatelju\\" which were included and became big hits. Many consider the two tracks to be classic Rambo: observant, opinionated, direct and profane. The latter of the two originally included excerpts from Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tuđman speeches, but the record company censors took them out. This album further solidified Rambo's presence on the scene as he started playing bigger arenas like Sava centar. Due to outspoken and entertaining nature he would often get invited on various TV and radio outlets across the country. During “Belgrade spring” festival in 1992. he showed civil courage when he interrupted a concert by “Bebi Dol” during live TV broadcast and said to tens of thousands of viewers: “As we play here bombs are falling on Dubrovnik and Tuzla. We won’t entertain the political voters no more. F*** your mothers!” He threw the microphone on the floor, left the stage and the show was over. Trying to take the new situation in stride, he hit the road, becoming one of the first performers from FR Yugoslavia to regularly start touring Macedonia and Slovenia in the years following those states' declarations of independence. After live album KPGS (taped on December 29, 1992 in Skopje) that included new studio track \\"Karamba karambita\\" followed by a greatest hits compilation Izabrana dela 1989–1994, Rambo recorded peculiar new material during July 1995 in Paris with Goran Vejvoda. Released the following year as Mikroorganizmi, it featured inaccessible, moody sound garnered with terse, experimental music marking a sizable departure from his usual antics. He simultaneously released Muzika za decu, personal musical take on Ljubivoje Ršumović's poetry featuring two bonus new tracks – \\"Sex\\" and \\"ABVGD\\". Old-school Rambo fans did not have to wait long for a return to earlier style. Towards the end of 1996, on Titanik he delivered a new batch of traditional fare like \\"Šakom u glavu\\", \\"Sado-mazo\\", \\"Zreo za penziju\\" and \\"Otiš'o je svak ko valja\\" (dedicated to Toma Zdravković and members of Šarlo Akrobata). Seasoned musicians like Ognjen Radivojević (who will become famous for working with such musicians like Goran Bregović and Zdravko Čolić), Goran Ljuboja, Dragan Markovski and Marija Mihajlović) took part in recording sessions for this album. Extensive tour followed and it again included Slovenia (live album was recorded over two Ljubljana concerts in April 1997 and later released as Koncert u KUD France Prešeren), as well as Bosnia where Rambo appeared as a guest at Sejo Sexon's Zabranjeno pušenje gig in Sarajevo. That appearance in December 1997 was the first post-war visit by a Montenegrin performer to the Bosnia. On June 9, 1998, Rambo played Belgrade's Dom Sindikata hall in what he announced to be the farewell performance before retirement. Even if many doubted his sincerity, the concert was a memorable one. Soon, Rambo packed his bags and left for the Netherlands, though not before squeezing in two more shows in Bosnia. In the Netherlands, he worked a series of menial jobs including construction, before deciding to return to Belgrade after only 4 months abroad. Back home, not surprisingly, he also returned to music and continued to break down inter-ethnic barriers: on December 10, 1998, he and Margita Stefanović played a show in Pula at the local cinema with KUD Idijoti, which was a first opportunity since the war for a Croatian audience to see performers from Serbia and Montenegro. =2000s= Throughout the year 2000, Rambo worked on what would eventually become the Don't Happy, Be Worry album. This album included the song Laganese in which sampled the Norwegian journalist Åsne Seierstad singing the Norwegian Folk song Eg rodde meg ut på seiegrunnen and swearing. By this time, sampling and local pop-cultural references became two more staples of his sound, and this material, too, was heavy on both. Produced by Iztok Turk, it featured tracks like \\"Čoban je upravo napustio zgradu\\" (loose cover of Neda Ukraden's \\"Zora je svanula\\"), \\"Moj skutere\\" that borrows from Oliver Dragojević's \\"Moj galebe\\", and \\"Izađite molim\\" with sprinkled in dialogues from Goran Marković's 1975 movie Variola vera. In 2003, he voiced Rafiki in the Serbian-language dub of The Lion King. In 2004, Rambo released his third live album Bolje jedno vruće pivo nego četri ladna, which was followed by the studio album Oprem dobro in mid-2005. He made a song \\"Dikh tu kava\\" in collaboration with ethno-jazz fusion band Kal, and in 2007 he appeared on their album as a featured artist in the song \\"Komedija\\" (\\"Comedy\\"). In autumn 2007 he performed a performance called \\"Mixing of alternative rocks\\", when he \\"played\\" on 12 concrete mixers in front of the audience, during The Alternative Rock Festival in SKC, Belgrade. For the purpose of the New Year's show on RTV, he appeared in the song \\"Rakija\\" followed by Zorule, the traditional folk orchestra. This song was used later as one of the tracks for \\"Vratiće se rode\\" TV serial. In February 2008, Rambo Amadeus performed as a guest star of The RTS Big Band jazz orchestra, for their 60th Anniversary. Hipishizik Metafizik is his latest studio album, released for PGP RTS in July 2008. =2010s= Rambo Amadeus was internally selected by the Montenegrin national broadcaster RTCG to represent Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan. His winning song \\"Euro Neuro\\" gained controversy for its video. He ultimately failed to make the Eurovision final. The same year, he was hired both in the Serbian and Croatian language dub of the Ice Age: Continental Drift animated film, as Captain Gutt.Vikler se pridružuje ekipi HortonaZapocela Sezona lova, Branislav Trifunovic I Goran Jevtic Rambo's performance on EuroSong was met with some controversies because of satirical nature of the song \\"Euro Neuro\\" towards Europe In 2013 he released a video for the new single O'Ruk on the Road Again with Three Winnettous. In 2015 he released the album \\"Vrh Dna\\", which featured previously unreleased track \\"Rano Za Početak\\" from 2011, and he retitled it \\"Samo Balade\\" for the album's release. In 2016, he landed two voice-work roles, as Mighty Eagle in the Croatian-language and Serbian-language version of The Angry Birds Movie, and as Crush in the Serbian-language version Finding Dory.Angry Birds Film sinkroniziraju zvijezde! (in Croatian)Potraga za Nemom (on Blog.vecernji) In 2018 he has tried to represent Serbia in Eurovision Song Contest 2018 with the song Nema Te, a duet with jazz singer Beti Đorđević. They performed the song in Beovizija 2018. and came 9th. Other endeavours In addition to a prolific solo recording career, Rambo frequently engaged in different, often bizarre side projects. *In 1989 in Sarajevo, for a short while, he hosted an erotic quiz show with actress Jasna Beri named Turbo- lilihip, which aired on a local TV station SA3. *He wrote music for different theatre plays such as ', ', as well as ' for which he was awarded Sterija prize in 1994. *Rambo also wrote lyrics for commercial folk stars like Lepa Brena and Vesna Zmijanac, as well as the entire score for 1994 film ', which was a star vehicle for another folk performer Dragana Mirković. *In 1994 he also wrote a musical score for the 1927 silent movie Metropolis by Fritz Lang. At a movie screening at Sava Center, Rambo's music was played by Belgrade Philharmonic. The material was later recorded by Rambo himself along with Miroslav Savić and Heavily Manipulated Orchestra, and released as Metropolis B (Tour-de-Force) *A year later, he arranged a cadenza within \\"A concerto for piano and orchestra in C-minor\\" by W.A. Mozart. In 1995, cadenza was performed by Ivan Tasovac, while the entire concert was conducted by Oskar Danon at Belgrade's Kolarac concert hall. *Since early 2005 Rambo has been writing a column ' (Mega-Imperial Thoughts) for the daily tabloid Blic. * In December 2010 he was a guest on Studio B's Agape program together with Serbian Orthodox bishop Porfirije where they talked about the meaning of life, finding ones's self way in life, slowing down, drug abuse and rehabilitation (Rambo confessed using marijuana for 20 years). * Rambo has done voice-work for the Serbian- Croatian language dubs of The Lion King franchise, Despicable Me, Ice Age: Continental Drift, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, The Angry Birds Movie and Finding Dory.

It began with the 1964 coup d'état led by the Armed Forces against the administration of President João Goulart—who, having been vice-president, had assumed the office of president upon the resignation of the democratically elected president Jânio Quadros—and ended when José Sarney took office on 15 March 1985 as President. The military revolt was fomented by Magalhães Pinto, Adhemar de Barros, and Carlos Lacerda (who had already participated in the conspiracy to depose Getúlio Vargas in 1945), then governors of the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Guanabara, respectively. The coup was planned and executed by the most forefront commanders of the Brazilian Army and received the support of almost all high-ranking members of the military, along with conservative elements in society, like the Catholic Church and anti-communist civil movements among the Brazilian middle and upper classes. Internationally, it was supported by the State Department of the United States through its embassy in Brasilia. The military dictatorship lasted for almost twenty-one years; despite initial pledges to the contrary, the military government, in 1967, enacted a new, restrictive Constitution, and stifled freedom of speech and political opposition. The regime adopted nationalism, economic development, and anti-communism as its guidelines. The dictatorship reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s with the so-called \\"Brazilian Miracle\\", even as the regime censored all media, and tortured and exiled dissidents. João Figueiredo became President in March 1979; in the same year he passed the Amnesty Law for political crimes committed for and against the regime. While combating the \\"hardliners\\" inside the government and supporting a re-democratization policy, Figueiredo could not control the crumbling economy, chronic inflation and concurrent fall of other military dictatorships in South America. Amid massive popular demonstrations in the streets of the main cities of the country, the first free elections in 20 years were held for the national legislature in 1982. In 1985, another election was held, this time to elect (indirectly) a new president, being contested between civilian candidates for the first time since the 1960s, being won by the opposition. In 1988, a new Constitution was passed and Brazil officially returned to democracy. Since then, the military has remained under the control of civilian politicians, with no official role in domestic politics. Brazil's military government provided a model for other military regimes and dictatorships throughout Latin America, being systematized by the so-called \\"Doctrine of National Security\\", which \\"justified\\" the military's actions as operating in the interest of national security in a time of crisis, creating an intellectual basis upon which other military regimes relied upon. In 2014, nearly 30 years after the regime collapsed, the Brazilian military recognized for the first time the excesses committed by its agents during the years of the dictatorship, including the torture and murder of political dissidents. In May 2018, the United States government released a memorandum, written by Henry Kissinger, dating back to April 1974 (when he was serving as Secretary of State), confirming that the leadership of the Brazilian military regime was fully aware of the killing of dissidents. It is estimated that 434 people were either confirmed killed or went missing (not to be seen again) during the military dictatorship in Brazil. While some human rights activists and others assert that the true figure could be much higher, the armed forces have always disputed this. Background Brazil's political crisis stemmed from the way in which the political tensions had been controlled in the 1930s and 1940s during the Vargas Era. Vargas' dictatorship and the presidencies of his democratic successors marked different stages of Brazilian populism (1930–1964), an era of economic nationalism, state-guided modernization, and import substitution trade policies. Vargas' policies were intended to foster an autonomous capitalist development in Brazil, by linking industrialization to nationalism, a formula based on a strategy of reconciling the conflicting interests of the middle class, foreign capital, the working class, and the landed oligarchy. Essentially, this was the epic of the rise and fall of Brazilian populism from 1930 to 1964: Brazil witnessed over the course of this time period the change from export-orientation of the First Brazilian Republic (1889–1930) to the import substitution of the populist era (1930–1964) and then to a moderate structuralism of 1964–80. Each of these structural changes forced a realignment in society and caused a period of political crisis. Period of right-wing military dictatorship marked the transition between populist era and the current period of democratization. The Brazilian Armed Forces acquired great political clout after the Paraguayan War. The politicization of the Armed Forces was evidenced by the Proclamation of the Republic, which overthrew the Empire, or within Tenentismo (Lieutenants' movement) and the Revolution of 1930. Tensions escalated again in the 1950s, as important military circles (the \\"hard-line militars\\", old positivists whose origins could be traced back to the AIB and the Estado Novo) joined the elite, medium classes and right-wing activists in attempts to stop Presidents Juscelino Kubitschek and João Goulart from taking office, due to their supposed support for Communist ideology. While Kubitschek proved to be friendly to capitalist institutions, Goulart promised far-reaching reforms, expropriated business interests and promoted economical-political neutrality with the US. After Goulart suddenly assumed power in 1961, society became deeply polarized, with the elites fearing that Brazil would become another Cuba and join the Communist Bloc, while many thought that the reforms would boost greatly the growth of Brazil and end its economical subservience with the US, or even that Goulart could be used to increase the popularity of the Communist agenda. Influential politicians, such as Carlos Lacerda and even Kubitschek, media moguls (Roberto Marinho, Octávio Frias, Júlio de Mesquita Filho), the Church, landowners, businessmen, and the middle class called for a coup d'état by the Armed Forces to remove the government. The old \\"hard-line\\" army officers, seeing a chance to impose their positivist economic program, convinced the loyalists that Goulart was a communist menace. Goulart and the fall of the Fourth Republic João Goulart, a lawyer, was the left-leaning President ousted by the Armed Forces. He fled to Uruguay, where his family owned estâncias. After the Presidency of Juscelino Kubitschek, the right wing opposition elected Jânio Quadros, who based his electoral campaign on criticizing Kubitschek and government corruption. Quadros' campaign symbol was a broom, with which the president would \\"sweep away the corruption.\\" In his brief tenure as president, Quadros made moves to resume relations with some communist countries, made some controversial laws and law proposals, but without legislative support, he couldn't follow his agenda. In the last days of August 1961, Quadros tried to break the impasse by resigning from the presidency, apparently with the intention of being reinstated by popular demand. João Goulart was Vice President. He was a member of the Brazilian Labour Party and has been active in politics since the Vargas Era. As Quadros resigned, Goulart was outside the country visiting China. At that time Brazil's President and Vice President were elected from different party tickets. Some military top brass tried to prevent Goulart from assuming the Presidency, accusing him of being communist, but the legalist campaign in support of Goulart was already strong. The crisis was solved by the \\"parliamentarian solution\\" - an arrangement that decreased the powers of the President by creating a new post of Prime Minister which was filled by Tancredo Neves and instituting a Parliamentary republic. Brazil returned to Presidential government in 1963 after a referendum, and, as Goulart's powers grew, it became evident that he would seek to implement \\"base reforms\\" (bottom-up reforms) such as land reform and nationalization of enterprises in various economic sectors (which would remove the nation from its antique latifundial economy). The reforms were considered communist. Goulart sought to implement the reforms regardless of assent from established institutions such as Congress. Goulart had low parliamentarian support, due to the fact that his centrist attempts to win support from both sides of the spectrum gradually came to alienate both.\\"Brasil: Uma Historia - Eduardo Bueno\\" http://www.brasilumahistoria.com.br/ Over time, Goulart was forced to shift well to the left of his mentor Getúlio Vargas and was forced to mobilize the working class and even the peasantry amid falling urban bourgeois support. The core of Brazilian populism was economic nationalism, and that was no longer appealing to the middle classes. On 1 April 1964, after a night of conspiracy, rebel troops made their way to Rio de Janeiro, considered a legalist bastion. São Paulo's and Rio de Janeiro's generals were convinced to join the coup. To prevent a civil war, and in knowledge that the USA would openly support the army, the President fled first to Rio Grande do Sul, and then went to exile in Uruguay, where his family owned large estates. =United States involvement= U.S. President John F. Kennedy (left) and President Goulart during a review of troops on 3 April 1962. Kennedy mulled possible military intervention in Brazil The US Ambassador Lincoln Gordon later admitted that the embassy had given money to anti-Goulart candidates in the 1962 municipal elections, and had encouraged the plotters; many extra United States military and intelligence personnel were operating in four United States Navy oil tankers and the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal, in an operation code-named Operation Brother Sam. These ships had positioned off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in case Brazilian troops required military assistance during the 1964 coup. A document from Gordon in 1963 to US president John F. Kennedy also describes the ways João Goulart should be put down, and his fears of a communist intervention supported by the Soviets or by Cuba. Washington immediately recognized the new government in 1964, and hailed the coup d'état as one of the \\"democratic forces\\" that had allegedly staved off the hand of international communism. American mass media outlets like Henry Luce's TIME also gave positive remarks about the dissolution of political parties and salary controls at the beginning of Castello Branco mandate. Brazil actively participated in the CIA-backed state terror campaign against left-wing dissidents known as Operation Condor. =The Excuse of the \\"Communist Threat\\"= The argument used to justify the establishment of a military dictatorship in the country was the imminence of a \\"communist threat\\" in 1964. The historian Rodrigo Patto Sá Motta (pt) disputes the assertion that communism was of sufficient strength in Brasil to threaten the democratic system in 1964. In an interview, Motta said: Instead, Motta asserts that the assertion of a \\"communist threat\\" was fabricated to unify the Brasilian armed forces and increase their support among the general population. The Intercept reported that the asserted threat of Jango's \\"guerrillas,\\" the weapons in possession of the Peasant Leagues (pt) (considered the MST of the time) and the communist infiltrations into the armed forces were nothing more than fantasy, and that the coup of 64 occurred without resistance, since \\"there was no resistance.\\" Moreover, the communist armed struggles only appeared after the implementation of the dictatorship, and not before it, and in fact never put Brazilian democracy at risk. Divisions within the officer corps The armed forces' officer corps was divided between those who believed that they should confine themselves to their barracks, and the hard-liners who regarded politicians as willing to turn Brazil to communism. The victory of the hard- liners dragged Brazil into what political scientist Juan J. Linz called \\"an authoritarian situation.\\" However, because the hard-liners could not ignore the counterweight opinions of their colleagues or the resistance of society, they were unable to institutionalize their agenda politically. In addition, they did not attempt to eliminate liberal constitutionalism because they feared disapproval of international opinion and damage to their alignment with the United States. The United States as bastion of anticommunism during the Cold War, provided the ideology that the authoritarians used to justify their hold on power. Washington also preached liberal democracy, which forced the authoritarians to assume the contradictory position of defending democracy, while destroying it. Their concern for appearances caused them to abstain from personal dictatorship by requiring each successive general-president to hand over power to his replacement. Castelobranco.jpgMarshal Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco Costa e Silva.jpgMarshal Artur da Costa e Silva Garrastazu médici.jpgGeneral Emílio Garrastazu Médici Ernesto Geisel.jpgGeneral Ernesto Geisel Figueiredo.jpgGeneral João Figueiredo Establishing the regime, Castelo Branco The Army could not find a civilian politician acceptable to all of the factions that supported the ouster of João Goulart. On 9 April 1964 coup leaders published the First Institutional Act, which greatly limited the freedoms of the 1946 constitution. President was granted authority to remove elected officials from office, dismiss civil servants, and revoke for 10 years the political rights of those found guilty of subversion or misuse of public funds. On 11 April 1964 the Congress elected the Army Chief of Staff, Marshal Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco as President for the remainder of Goulart's term. Castelo Branco had intentions of overseeing a radical reform of the political-economic system and then returning power to elected officials. He refused to remain in power beyond the remainder of Goulart's term or to institutionalize the military in power. However, competing demands radicalized the situation. Military \\"hard-line\\" wanted a complete purge of left-wing and populist influences while civilian politicians obstructed Castelo Branco's reforms. The latter accused him of hard-line actions to achieve his objectives, and the former accused him of leniency. On 27 October 1965, after victory of opposition candidates in two provincial elections, he signed the Second Institutional act which purged Congress, removed objectionable state governors and expanded President's arbitrary powers at the expense of the legislative and judiciary branches. This gave him the latitude to repress the populist left but also provided the subsequent governments of Artur da Costa e Silva (1967–69) and Emílio Garrastazu Médici (1969–74) with a \\"legal\\" basis for their hard-line authoritarian rule. – Minister of Transportation and colonel Mario Andreazza to journalist Carl Rowan, 1967 Castelo Branco, through extra- constitutional decrees dubbed \\"Institutional Acts\\" (Portuguese: \\"Ato Institucional\\" or \\"AI\\"), gave the executive the unchecked ability to change the constitution and remove anyone from office (\\"AI-1\\") as well as to have the presidency elected by Congress. A two-party system was created - the ruling government-backed National Renewal Alliance (ARENA) and the mild not-leftist opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party (\\"AI-2\\"). In the new Constitution of 1967 the name of the country was changed from Republic of the United States of Brazil to Federative Republic of Brazil. Hardening of the regime, Costa e Silva A column of M41 Walker Bulldog tanks along the streets of Rio de Janeiro in April 1968. Castelo Branco was succeeded to the Presidency by General Artur da Costa e Silva who was representative of hard- line elements of the regime. On 13 December 1968 he signed the Fifth Institutional Act that gave President dictatorial powers, dissolved Congress and state legislatures, suspended the constitution, and imposed censorship. On 31 August 1969 Costa e Silva suffered a stroke. Instead of his Vice-president all state power was assumed by military joint, which then chose General Emílio Garrastazu Médici as the new President. Years of Lead, Medici Brazil: love it or leave it, a slogan of the military regime. A hardliner, Médici sponsored the greatest human rights abuses of the time period. During his government, persecution and torture of dissidents, harassment against journalists and press censorship became ubiquitous. The succession of kidnappings of foreign ambassadors in Brazil embarrassed the military government. The anti-government manifestations and the action of guerrilla movements generated an increase in repressive measures. Urban guerrillas from Ação Libertadora Nacional and Revolutionary Movement 8th October were suppressed, and military operations undertaken to finish the Araguaia Guerrilla War. The \\"ideological frontiers\\" of Brazilian foreign policy were reinforced. By the end of 1970, the official minimum wage went down to US$40/month, and the more than one-third of Brazilian workforce which had their wages tied to it lost about 50% of its purchasing power in relation to the 1960 levels of the Juscelino Kubitschek administration. Institutional Act Number Five Nevertheless, Médici was popular, as his term was met with the largest economic growth of any Brazilian President, the Brazilian Miracle unfolded and the country won the 1970 Football World Cup. In 1971 Médici presented the First National Development Plan aimed at increasing the rate of economic growth especially in remote Northeast and Amazonia. The results of his economic policy consolidated the option for the national-development model. Because of these results, the country's foreign economic connections were transformed, allowing its international presence to be broadened. In November 1970 federal, state, and municipal elections were held. Most of the seats were won by ARENA candidates. In 1973 electoral college was created and in January 1974 General Ernesto Geisel was elected to be the next President. Resistance The fall of João Goulart worried many citizens. Many students, Marxists, and workers formed groups that opposed military rule. A minority of these adopted direct armed struggle, while most supported political solutions to the mass suspension of human rights. In the first few months after the coup, thousands of people were detained, while thousands of others were removed from their civil service or university positions. In 1968 there was a brief relaxation of the nation's repressive politics. Experimental artists and musicians formed the Tropicalia movement during this time. However, some of the major popular musicians Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, for instance were arrested, imprisoned, and exiled. Chico Buarque left the country, in self-proclaimed exile. Student stroll against the military dictatorship, 1966. The first signs of resistance to this repression were seen with the appearance of widespread student protests. In response, the government issued the Fifth Institutional Act in December 1968, which suspended habeas corpus, closed Congress, ended democratic government, and instituted other repressive features. In 1969 the Revolutionary Movement 8th October kidnapped Charles Burke Elbrick, the U.S. ambassador to Brazil. The resistance fighters demanded the release of imprisoned dissidents who were being cruelly tortured in exchange for Ambassador Elbrick. The government responded by adopting more brutal measures of counter-insurgency, leading to the assassination of Carlos Marighela, a guerrilla leader, two months after Elbrick's kidnapping. This marked the beginning of the decline of armed opposition. In 1970, Nobuo Okuchi, Japanese consul general in Sāo Paulo, was kidnapped, while Curtis C. Cutter, U.S. consul in Porto Alegre, was wounded in the shoulder but escaped kidnapping. Also in 1970, Ehrenfried von Holleben, West German Ambassador, was kidnapped in Rio and one of his bodyguards was killed.Pattern of Terror. Time.com.  Repression  After the military coup, the new government put forward a series of measures to strengthen its rule and weaken the opposition. The complex structure of the state’s repression reached several areas of Brazilian society, and involved the implementation of measures of censorship, persecutions, and violations of human rights. The systematic repression during this period in the Brazilian history was dependent on and alternated between the so-called “moderates” (“moderados”) and “hard-liners” (“linha dura”) in power. The most aggressive set of repressive measures took place during the period between 1968 and 1978, called the Leaden Years (Anos de Chumbo). The repressive characteristic of the regime, however, was present in the Brazilian society throughout the military rule. = Censorship = The mainstream media, initially in pair with the military intervention at the coup’s eve, later became contrary to the government and thus under heavy censorship rules . The management of all sectors of national communication was overseen by the Special Counsel of Public Relations (Assessoria Especial de Relações Públicas) created in the beginning of 1968 while censorship was institutionalized through the Higher Counsel of Censorship (Conselho Superior de Censura) later on that same year. The Higher Counsel of Censorship was overseen by the Ministry of Justice, which was in charge of analyzing and revising decisions put forward by the director of the Federal Cops department. The ministry also was responsible for establishing guidelines and norms to implement censorship at local levels. Institutionalized censorship affected all areas of communication in Brazilian society:- newspaper, television, music, theater, and all industries related to mass communication activities, including marketing companies. Despite the regime’s efforts to censor any and all pieces of media that could hurt the government, the population found ways to get around it as much as possible. Even though artists and journalists had to have permission from the counsel to publish any piece of communication, they sometimes were able to surpass censorship barriers through unconventional ways. Musicians would rely on word play to publish songs with veiled criticisms towards the government while famous newspapers would fill in empty spaces left blank due to censored articles with random cake recipes, a way to indicate to the population the government’s involvement with their publication. =Human rights violations= Monument to the victims of torture in Recife As early as 1964, the military government was already using the various forms of torture it devised systematically to not only gain information it used to crush opposition groups, but to intimidate and silence any further potential opponents. This radically increased after 1968. While other dictatorships killed more people, Brazil saw the widespread use of torture, as it also had during the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas; Vargas's enforcer Filinto Müller has been named the \\"patron of torturers\\" in Brazil. Advisors from the United States and United Kingdom trained Brazilian forces in interrogation and torture. To extinguish its left-wing opponents, the dictatorship used arbitrary arrests, imprisonment without trials, kidnapping, and most of all, torture, which included rape and castration. The book Torture in Brazil provides accounts of only a fraction of the atrocities committed by the government. The military government murdered hundreds of others, although this was done mostly in secret and the cause of death often falsely reported as accidental. The government occasionally dismembered and hid the bodies. French General Paul Aussaresses, a veteran of the Algerian War, came to Brazil in 1973. General Aussaresses used \\"counter-revolutionary warfare\\" methods during the Battle of Algiers, including the systemic use of torture, executions and death flights. He later trained U.S. officers and taught military courses for Brazil's military intelligence. He later acknowledged maintaining close links with the military.Marie-Moniques de la mort - l'école française (See here, starting at 24 min) So far nobody has been punished for these human rights violations, because of the 1979 Amnesty Law written by the members of the government who stayed in place during the transition to democracy. The law grants amnesty and impunity to any government official or citizen accused of political crimes during the dictatorship. Because of a certain \\"cultural amnesia\\" in Brazil, the victims have never garnered much sympathy, respect, or acknowledgement of their suffering. Work is underway to alter the Amnesty Law, which has been condemned by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The National Truth Commission was created in 2011 attempting to help the nation face its past and honor those who fought for democracy, and to compensate the family members of those killed or disappeared. Its work was concluded in 2014. It reported that under military regime at least 191 people were killed and 243 \\"disappeared\\". The total number of deaths probably measures in the hundreds, not reaching but could be nearing one thousand, while more than 50,000 people were detained and 10,000 forced to go into exile. According to the Comissão de Direitos Humanos e Assistência Jurídica da Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil, the \\"Brazilian death toll from government torture, assassination and 'disappearances' for 1964–81 was [...] 333, which included 67 killed in the Araguaia guerrilla front in 1972–74\\"., pp. 269 and 395 According to the Brazilian Army 97 military and civilians were killed by terrorist and guerrilla actions made by leftist groups during the same period., p.396 In a 2014 report by Brazil's National Truth Commission which documented the human rights abuses of the military government, it was noted that the United States \\"had spent years teaching the torture techniques to the Brazilian military during that period.\\" Geisel administration, distensão, and the 1973 oil shock It was in this atmosphere that retired General Ernesto Geisel (1974–79) was elected to Presidency with Médici's approval. Geisel was a well-connected Army General and former president of Petrobras. There had been intense behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the hard-liners against him and by the more moderate supporters of Castelo Branco for him. Fortunately for Geisel, his older brother, Orlando Geisel was the Minister of Army, and his close ally, General João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo, was chief of Médici's military staff. Once in power, Geisel adopted a more moderate stance with regards to political opposition than his predecessor Médici. =Decompression policy= Although not immediately understood by civilians, Ernesto Geisel's accession signaled a move toward a less oppressive rule. He replaced several regional commanders with trusted officers and labeled his political programs abertura (opening) and distensão (decompression), meaning a gradual relaxation of authoritarian rule. It would be, in his words, \\"the maximum of development possible with the minimum of indispensable security.\\" Together with his Chief of Staff, Minister Golbery do Couto e Silva Geisel devised a plan of gradual, slow democratization that would eventually succeed despite all the threats and opposition from hard- liners. However, the torture of the regime's left-wing and Communist opponents by DOI-CODI was still ongoing as demonstrated by the murder of Vladimir Herzog. Geisel allowed opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) to run an almost free election campaign before November 1974 elections and MDB won more votes than ever. When opposition MDB party won more seats in 1976 Congress elections, Geisel in April 1977 used powers granted to him by AI-5, dismissed Congress and introduced a new package of laws (April Package), that made gubernatorial elections indirect and created an electoral college for electing the next President, thus safeguarding ARENA positions. In 1977 and 1978 the Presidential succession issue caused further political confrontation with the hard-liners. In October 1977 he suddenly dismissed the far-right Minister of Army, General Sylvio Couto Coelho da Frota who had tried to become candidate for the next President. In May 1978 Geisel had to deal with the first labor strikes since 1964. 500 000 workers, led by the future President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, demanded and won 11% wage increase. By the end of his Presidency Geisel had allowed exiled citizens to return, restored habeas corpus, repealed the extraordinary powers, on December 1978 ended the Fifth Institutional Act, and imposed General João Figueiredo (1979–85) as his successor in March 1979. =Economy= A Dodge 1800 was the first prototype engineered with a neat ethanol-only engine. Exhibit at the Memorial Aeroespacial Brasileiro, CTA, São José dos Campos. The Brazilian Fiat 147 was the first modern automobile launched to the market capable of running on neat hydrous ethanol fuel (E100). President Geisel sought to maintain high economic growth rates of the Brazilian Miracle which were tied to maintaining the prestige of the regime, even while seeking to deal with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis. Geisel removed long-time Minister of Finance Antônio Delfim Netto. He maintained massive state investments in infrastructure—highways, telecommunications, hydroelectric dams, mineral extraction, factories, and atomic energy. All this required more international borrowing and increased state's debt. Fending off nationalist objections, he opened Brazil to oil prospecting by foreign firms for the first time since the early 1950s. He also tried to reduce Brazil's reliance on oil, by signing a US$10 billion agreement with West Germany to build eight nuclear reactors in Brazil. During this time ethanol production program was promoted as an alternative to gasoline and the first ethanol fueled cars were produced. Brazil suffered drastic reductions in its terms of trade as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. In the early 1970s, the performance of the export sector was undermined by an overvalued currency. With the trade balance under pressure, the oil shock led to a sharply higher import bill. Thus, the Geisel government borrowed billions of dollars to see Brazil through the oil crisis. This strategy was effective in promoting growth, but it also raised Brazil's import requirements markedly, increasing the already large current-account deficit. The current account was financed by running up the foreign debt. The expectation was that the combined effects of import substitution industrialization and export expansion eventually would bring about growing trade surpluses, allowing the service and repayment of the foreign debt. U.S. President Jimmy Carter addresses the Brazilian Congress, 30 March 1978 Brazil shifted its foreign policy to meet its economic needs. \\"Responsible pragmatism\\" replaced strict alignment with the United States and a worldview based on ideological frontiers and blocs of nations. Because Brazil was 80% dependent on imported oil, Geisel shifted the country from uncritical support of Israel to a more neutral stance on Middle Eastern affairs. His government also recognized the People's Republic of China and the new socialist governments of Angola and Mozambique, both former Portuguese colonies. The government moved closer to Latin America, Europe, and Japan. Brasil's intention to build nuclear reactors with West Germany's help created tensions with the US which did not want to see a nuclear Brazil. After election of Carter a greater emphasis was put on the human rights. The new Harkin Amendment limited American military assistance to countries with human rights violations. Brazilian right-wingers and military viewed this as incursion on Brazilian sovereignty and Geisel renounced any future military aid from United States in April 1977. Transition to democracy, Figueiredo Pro-democracy Diretas Já demonstration in 1984. President João Figueiredo steered the country back to democracy and promoted the transfer of power to civilian rule, facing opposition from hardliners in the military. Figueiredo was an Army General and former head of the secret service, National Intelligence Service of Brazil. As president, he continued the gradual \\"abertura\\" (democratization) process that was begun in 1974. An amnesty law, signed by Figueiredo on 28 August 1979, amnestied those convicted of \\"political or related\\" crimes between 1961 and 1978. In the early 1980s, the military regime could no longer effectively maintain the two-party system established in 1966. The Figueiredo administration dissolved the government- controlled National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA) and allowed new parties to be formed. The president was often incapacitated by illness and took two prolonged leaves for health treatment in 1981 and 1983, but the civilian vice president Antônio Aureliano Chaves de Mendonça did not enjoy major political power. In 1981 the Congress enacted a law on restoration of direct elections of state governors. The general election of 1982 brought a narrow victory to ARENA's successor, pro-government Democratic Social Party (43.22% of the vote), while the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement Party received 42.96% of votes. The governorship of three major states, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, was won by the opposition. However, the political developments were overshadowed by increasing economic problems. As inflation and unemployment soared, the foreign debt reached massive proportions making Brazil the world's biggest debtor owing about US$90 billion to international lenders. The austerity program imposed by the government brought no signs of recovery for the Brazilian economy. In 1984. Diretas Já demonstrators took over the country and epitomized the newly regained freedoms of assembly and expression, but the movement's primary objective was not attained, and the 1985 presidential election was held indirectly, via selected electoral college. The opposition vigorously struggled for passing a constitutional amendment that would allow direct popular Presidential elections in November 1984, but the proposal failed to win passage in the Congress. Opposition's candidate Tancredo Neves succeeded Figueiredo when Congress held an election for the new President. Foreign relations Emílio G. Médici (left) and Richard Nixon, December 1971. Figueiredo and U.S. President Ronald Reagan riding horses in Brasília, 1 December 1982. During this period Brazil's international agenda incorporated new perceptions. With nationalist military — who were State-control devotees — in power, there was increased energy for questioning the disparities of the international system. Interest in expanding state presence in the economy was accompanied by policies intended to transform Brazil's profile abroad. The relationship with the United States was still valued, but policy alignment was no longer total. Connections between Brazilian international activity and its economic interests led foreign policy, conducted by foreign minister José de Magalhães Pinto (1966–67), to be labeled \\"Prosperity Diplomacy.\\" This new emphasis of Brazil's international policy was followed by an appraisal of relations maintained with the United States in the previous years. It was observed that the attempted strengthening of ties had yielded limited benefits. A revision of the Brazilian ideological stand within the world system was added to this perception. This state of affairs was further enhanced by the momentary relaxation of the bipolar confrontation during détente. In this context, it became possible to think of substituting the concept of limited sovereignty for full sovereignty. Development was made a priority for Brazilian diplomacy. These conceptual transformations were supported by the younger segments of Itamaraty (Ministry of External Relations), identified with the tenets of the independent foreign policy that had distinguished the early 1960s. Based on the priorities of its foreign policy, Brazil adopted new positions in various international organizations. Its performance at the II Conference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1968, in defense of non- discriminatory and preferential treatment for underdeveloped countries' manufactured goods, was noteworthy. The same level of concern distinguished the Brazilian stand at the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) meeting in Viña del Mar (1969). On this occasion, Brazil voiced its support of a Latin American union project. In the security sphere, disarmament was defended and the joint control system of the two superpowers condemned. Brazil was particularly critical of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, with a view to guarantee the right to develop its own nuclear technology. This prerogative had already been defended previously, when the Brazilian government decided not to accept the validity of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TNP) in Latin America and the Caribbean. Brazil's position on the TNP became emblematic of the negative posture that it would, from then onwards, sustain regarding the power politics of the United States and the Soviet Union. Its initial detailing was influenced by the presence of João Augusto de Araújo Castro as ambassador to the UN and president of the Security Council in the years 1968–69. Brazil tried to strengthen its position with nuclear cooperation negotiated settlements with countries such as Israel (1966), France (1967), India (1968) and the United States (1972). The changes in Brazilian diplomacy were to be also reflected in other matters on the international agenda, such as the moderate stance taken with regard to the \\"Six-Day War\\" between Arabs and Israelis. In the multilateral sphere, the country championed the cause of the reform of the United Nations Organization charter. The expansion of Brazil's international agenda coincided with the administrative reform of the Ministry of External Relations. Its move to Brasília in 1971 was followed by internal modernization. New departments were created, responding to the diversification of the international agenda and the increasing importance of economic diplomacy. Examples include the creation of a trade promotion system (1973) and the Alexandre de Gusmão Foundation (1971) to develop studies and research foreign policy. Foreign policy during the Gibson Barboza mandate (1969–74) united three basic positions. The first one, ideological, defended the existence of military governments in Latin America. To achieve that, the Organization of American States fought terrorism in the region. The second one criticized the distension process between the two superpowers, condemning the effects of American and Soviet power politics. The third requested support for development, considering that Brazil, with all its economic potential, deserved greater responsibility within the international system. New demands and intentions appeared, related to the idea that the nation was strengthening its bargaining power in the world system. At international forums, its main demand became \\"collective economic security\\". The endeavor to lead Third World countries made Brazil value multilateral diplomacy. Efforts in this direction can be observed at the UN Conference on Environment (1972), the GATT meeting in Tokyo (1973) and the Law of the Sea Conference (1974). This new Brazilian stance served as a base for the revival of its relationship with the United States. Differentiation from other Latin American countries was sought, to mean special treatment from the United States. Nevertheless, not only was this expectation not fulfilled but military assistance and the MEC-USAID educational cooperation agreement were interrupted. Washington held itself aloof at the time of President Médici's visit to the United States in 1971. In response, especially in the military and diplomatic spheres, nationalist ideas were kindled and raised questions about the alignment policy with the United States. The presence of J.A. de Araújo Castro as ambassador to Washington contributed to the re-definition of relations with the American government. The strategic move was to try to expand the negotiation agenda by paying special attention to the diversification of trade relations, the beginning of nuclear cooperation, and the inclusion of new international policy themes. In 1971 the military dictatorship helped rig Uruguayan elections, which Frente Amplio, a left-wing political party, lost. The government participated in Operation Condor, which involved various Latin American security services (including Pinochet's DINA and the Argentine SIDE) in the assassination of political opponents. During this period, Brazil began to devote more attention to less-developed countries. Technical cooperation programs were initiated in Latin America and in Africa, accompanied in some cases by State company investment projects – in particular in the fields of energy and communication. With this pretext, an inter-ministerial system was created by Itamaraty and the Ministry of Planning, whose function it was to select and coordinate international cooperation projects. To foster these innovations, in 1972 foreign minister Gibson Barboza visited Senegal, Togo, Ghana, Dahomey, Gabon, Zaïre, Nigeria, Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire. However, the prospect of economic interests and the establishment of cooperation programs with these countries was not followed by a revision of the Brazilian position on the colonial issue. Traditional loyalty was still towards Portugal. Attempts were made to consolidate the creation of a Portuguese-Brazilian community.

Wilcock & M.D. Swaine 1989. Ecology and taxonomy of Bornean Nepenthes. University of Aberdeen Tropical Biology Newsletter 56: 2–4. The specific epithet albomarginata, formed from the Latin words albus (white) and marginatus (margin), refers to the white band of trichomes that is characteristic of this species. Botanical history Nepenthes albomarginata was first collected by Thomas Lobb in 1848. It was formally described a year later by John Lindley in The Gardeners' Chronicle. The species was introduced into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1856. In the 1996 book Pitcher-Plants of Borneo, N. albomarginata is given the vernacular name white-collared pitcher-plant.Phillipps, A. & A. Lamb 1996. Pitcher-Plants of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. This name, along with all others, was dropped from the much-expanded second edition, published in 2008.Phillipps, A., A. Lamb & C.C. Lee 2008. Pitcher Plants of Borneo. Second Edition. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Description Nepenthes albomarginata is a climbing plant. The stem may reach lengths of up to and is up to in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical in cross section and up to long. Leaves are coriaceous in texture. The lamina or leaf blade is lanceolate in shape and up to long by wide. It has an acute apex and its base is gradually attenuate and amplexicaul. The leaves of this species are characteristic in that they completely lack a petiole. Longitudinal veins are indistinct. Tendrils are up to long. Rosette and lower pitchers are bulbous in the basal third and cylindrical above. They are relatively small, reaching only in height by in width. A pair of fringed wings up to wide runs down the front of each pitcher. The pitcher mouth is round and rises to form a short neck at the rear. The peristome is cylindrical in cross section, up to wide, and bears indistinct teeth. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 34% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90–102. A dense band of short white trichomes is present directly below the peristome, although these may be missing from pitchers that have caught termites. The glandular region covers the bulbous portion of the pitcher's inner surface. The lid or operculum is suborbicular and lacks appendages. An unbranched spur (≤ long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers are similar to their lower counterparts in most respects. They are cylindrical-infundibular throughout and have a pair of ribs in place of wings. Nepenthes albomarginata has a racemose inflorescence that is usually longer in male plants. The peduncle is up to long, while the rachis reaches lengths of up to . Partial peduncles are one- or two-flowered, up to long, and lack a bract. Sepals are obovate to oblong in shape and up to long. A study of 120 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (J.H.Adam 2417, collected in Borneo at an altitude of ) found the mean pollen diameter to be (SE = 0.4; CV = 6.2%).Adam, J.H. & C.C. Wilcock 1999. Palynological study of Bornean Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science 22(1): 1–7. Most parts of the plant are covered in a dense indumentum of very short, stellate white hairs. However, the underside of the lamina bears a dense covering of long hairs. Ecology Nepenthes albomarginata is a widespread species, occurring in Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra. It is also found on smaller islands such as Nias and Penang.McPherson, S.R. & A.

Wilcock & M.D. Swaine 1992. The ecology and distribution of Bornean Nepenthes. Journal of Tropical Forest Science 5(1): 13–25. N. albomarginata growing in Sumatran heath forest Its typical habitat consists of kerangas forest, but it has also been recorded from the summit vegetation of lowland peaks. It is known from peat and limestone substrates.Anderson, J.A.R. 1965. Limestone habitat in Sarawak. Proceedings of the Symposium on Ecological Research in Humid Tropics Vegetation, July 1963, Kuching, Sarawak. pp. 49–57. Carnivory Nepenthes albomarginata is notable for specializing in termites; most of the species in the genus Nepenthes are unselective about their prey. According to botanist Marlis A. Merbach and coworkers, this specialization to a single prey taxon is unique amongst carnivorous plants.Merbach, M.A., D.J. Merbach, U. Maschwitz, W.E. Booth, B. Fiala & G. Zizka 2002.

Nepenthes albomarginata has a unique morphological feature: a rim of living white trichomes directly below the peristome. The rim's hairs tend to be missing from pitchers that have caught termites. Merbach said \\"For several days, nothing would happen, then -- after a single night -- pitchers would fill with termites and their rim hairs would disappear.\\" Merbach investigated this phenomenon by placing fresh intact pitchers, together with pitchers with their white rims removed, near to the head of foraging columns of the termite Hospitalitermes bicolor. When the column found the pitcher, termites grazed on the rim. While grazing, many termites (both workers and soldiers) fell into the pitchers. Once in the pitcher, they were unable to climb out. Merbach counted up to 22 individuals per minute falling into the pitchers and noted that the capture rate could easily exceed this for denser columns. After about an hour, the hairs were all gone and the pitcher was evidently no longer attractive to termites (and was filled with termites trying to escape). It is not known how the trichomes lure termites to the plant. Merbach detected no long-range olfactory attraction during his experiments and noted that \\"all contacts seemed to happen by chance, with termites often missing pitchers less than 1 cm away from them.\\" Merbach also points out that N. albomarginata is the only plant species to offer its tissue as a bait. Related species In 2001, Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is a portion of the resultant cladogram, showing \\"Clade 6\\", which is only weakly supported at 50%. The sister pair of N. angasanensis and N. mikei has 79% support.

It has a population of 1,440. In 2010, Porlock had the most elderly population in Britain, with over 40% being of pensionable age. History East of the village is Bury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort. There is evidence for 10th or 11th century origin for the name Porlock as Portloc or Portloca meaning enclosure by the harbour, from the Old English port and loca. and in the Domesday Book the village was known as \\"Portloc\\". Porlock was part of the hundred of Carhampton. The area has links with several Romantic poets, and R. D. Blackmore, the author of Lorna Doone, and is popular with visitors. The visitor centre has exhibits and displays about the local area. Also on display are the bones of an aurochs, discovered on Porlock beach in 1999. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. As Porlock falls within the Exmoor National Park some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a 'single purpose' authority, which aims to \\"conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks\\" and \\"promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public\\", including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment. Porlock has an electoral ward called 'Porlock and District' but this stretches westwards to the Devon boundary, eastwards to Minehead and south to Wootton Courtenay. The total population of the ward at the 2011 census was 2,338. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography Porlock beach The village adjoins the Porlock Ridge and Saltmarsh nature reserve, created from the lowland behind a high shingle embankment which was breached by the sea in the 1990s, which has now been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Copses of white dead trees remind the visitor of when this was freshwater pasture. A stream flows down a wooded combe called Hawkcombe leads about three miles (5 km) from the village up to high open moorland. The stream, called \\"Hawkcombe Waters\\", runs past a Victorian hunting lodge, called The Cleeve, then underground beneath the Overstream Hotel in the centre of the village. The South West Coast Path goes through Porlock, many walkers stopping rather than continuing the long walk to Lynton. There is also a 'Coleridge Way' walk. Culbone Church is said to be the smallest church in England. The main structure is 12th century. Services are still held there, despite the lack of road access – Culbone is a two-mile (3 km) walk from Porlock Weir, and some 3–4 miles (about 6 km) from Porlock itself. A toll road bypasses the 1 in 4 gradient on Porlock Hill. There is the prehistoric Porlock Stone Circle on the hill. =Submerged forest= A map of Porlock from 1937 At low tide the remains of a submerged forest can be seen on Porlock Beach. The area was several miles inland until the sea level in the Bristol Channel rose about 7000 to 8000 years ago. Church The Church of St Dubricius dates from the 13th century. The spire was damaged in a storm of 1703. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. Within the church is a 15th-century tomb of John Harrington who fought alongside Henry V in France in 1417. Cultural references =\\"Person from Porlock\\"= In 1797, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who lived nearby at Nether Stowey (between Bridgwater and Minehead), was interrupted during composition of his poem Kubla Khan by \\"a person on business from Porlock\\", and claimed he found afterwards he could not remember what had come to him in a dream. Coleridge and William Wordsworth (who lived nearby at Alfoxden) would often roam the hills and coast on long night walks, leading to local gossip that they were 'spies' for the French. The Government sent an agent to investigate, but found they were \\"mere poets\\". Their walks are celebrated by the Coleridge Way which ends in Porlock. Their friend Robert Southey published a poem titled \\"Porlock\\" in 1798. =William Blake= Legend has it that the area beyond Culbone towards Lynmouth where Glenthorne is now situated is where Jesus may have alighted on a trip with Joseph of Arimathea. This is said to have inspired a passage from William Blake's famous poem, Milton: =Other cultural references= A song, titled \\"Another one from Porlock\\", is found on the Penguin Cafe Orchestra album Union Cafe. In Iris Murdoch's \\"Bruno's Dream\\", Miles admonishes Diana for porlocking while he is trying to receive poetic inspiration.

If we assume that the underlying model is multinomial, then the test statistic is defined by\\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{L(\\\\tilde{\\\\theta}x)}{L(\\\\hat{\\\\theta}x)} \\\\right) = \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{i=1}^m \\\\tilde{\\\\theta}_i^{x_i}}{\\\\prod_{i=1}^m \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_i^{x_i}} \\\\right)where \\\\tilde{\\\\theta} is the null hypothesis and \\\\hat{\\\\theta} is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameters given the data. Recall that for the multinomial model, the MLE of \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_i given some data is defined by\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_i = \\\\frac{x_i}{n}Furthermore, we may represent each null hypothesis parameter \\\\tilde{\\\\theta}_i as\\\\tilde{\\\\theta}_i = \\\\frac{e_i}{n}Thus, by substituting the representations of \\\\tilde{\\\\theta} and \\\\hat{\\\\theta} in the log-likelihood ratio, the equation simplifies to\\\\begin{align} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{L(\\\\tilde{\\\\theta}x)}{L(\\\\hat{\\\\theta}x)} \\\\right) &= \\\\ln \\\\prod_{i=1}^m \\\\left(\\\\frac{e_i}{x_i}\\\\right)^{x_i}  &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{e_i}{x_i}\\\\right)  \\\\end{align}Relabel the variables e_i with E_i and x_i with O_i. Finally, multiply by a factor of -2 (used to make the G test formula asymptotically equivalent to the Pearson's chi-squared test formula) to achieve the form \\\\begin{alignat}{2} G & = & \\\\; -2 \\\\sum_{i=1}^m O_i \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{E_i}{O_i}\\\\right)  & = & 2 \\\\sum_{i=1}^m O_i \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{O_i}{E_i}\\\\right) \\\\end{alignat} Distribution and usage Given the null hypothesis that the observed frequencies result from random sampling from a distribution with the given expected frequencies, the distribution of G is approximately a chi-squared distribution, with the same number of degrees of freedom as in the corresponding chi-squared test. For very small samples the multinomial test for goodness of fit, and Fisher's exact test for contingency tables, or even Bayesian hypothesis selection are preferable to the G-test. McDonald recommends to always use an exact test (exact test of goodness-of-fit, Fisher's exact test) if the total sample size is less than 1000. Relation to the chi-squared test The commonly used chi-squared tests for goodness of fit to a distribution and for independence in contingency tables are in fact approximations of the log-likelihood ratio on which the G-tests are based. The general formula for Pearson's chi-squared test statistic is : \\\\chi^2 = \\\\sum_{i} {\\\\frac{\\\\left(O_i - E_i\\\\right)^2}{E_i}} . The approximation of G by chi squared is obtained by a second order Taylor expansion of the natural logarithm around 1. With the advent of electronic calculators and personal computers, this is no longer a problem. A derivation of how the chi-squared test is related to the G-test and likelihood ratios, including to a full Bayesian solution is provided in Hoey (2012). For samples of a reasonable size, the G-test and the chi-squared test will lead to the same conclusions. However, the approximation to the theoretical chi-squared distribution for the G-test is better than for the Pearson's chi-squared test. In cases where O_i >2 \\\\cdot E_i for some cell case the G-test is always better than the chi-squared test. For testing goodness-of-fit the G-test is infinitely more efficient than the chi squared test in the sense of Bahadur, but the two tests are equally efficient in the sense of Pitman or in the sense of Hodges and Lehmann. Relation to Kullback–Leibler divergence The G-test statistic is proportional to the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the theoretical distribution from the empirical distribution: : \\\\begin{align} G &= 2\\\\sum_{i} {O_{i} \\\\cdot \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{O_i}{E_i}\\\\right)} = 2 N \\\\sum_{i} {o_i \\\\cdot \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{o_i}{e_i}\\\\right)}  &= 2 N \\\\, D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(o\\\\e), \\\\end{align} where N is the total number of observations and o_i and e_i are the empirical and theoretical frequencies, respectively. Relation to mutual information For analysis of contingency tables the value of G can also be expressed in terms of mutual information. Let :N = \\\\sum_{ij}{O_{ij}} \\\\; , \\\\; \\\\pi_{ij} = \\\\frac{O_{ij}}{N} \\\\; , \\\\; \\\\pi_{i.} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_j O_{ij}}{N} \\\\; , and \\\\; \\\\pi_{. j} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_i O_{ij}}{N} \\\\;. Then G can be expressed in several alternative forms: : G = 2 \\\\cdot N \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{ij}{\\\\pi_{ij} \\\\left( \\\\ln(\\\\pi_{ij})-\\\\ln(\\\\pi_{i.})-\\\\ln(\\\\pi_{.j}) \\\\right)} , : G = 2 \\\\cdot N \\\\cdot \\\\left[ H(r) + H(c) - H(r,c) \\\\right] , : G = 2 \\\\cdot N \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{MI}(r,c) \\\\, , where the entropy of a discrete random variable X \\\\, is defined as : H(X) = - {\\\\sum_{x \\\\in \\\\text{Supp}(X)} p(x) \\\\log p(x)} \\\\, , and where : \\\\operatorname{MI}(r,c)= H(r) + H(c) - H(r,c) \\\\, is the mutual information between the row vector r and the column vector c of the contingency table. It can also be shown that the inverse document frequency weighting commonly used for text retrieval is an approximation of G applicable when the row sum for the query is much smaller than the row sum for the remainder of the corpus. Similarly, the result of Bayesian inference applied to a choice of single multinomial distribution for all rows of the contingency table taken together versus the more general alternative of a separate multinomial per row produces results very similar to the G statistic. Application * The McDonald–Kreitman test in statistical genetics is an application of the G-test. * DunningDunning, Ted (1993). \\"Accurate Methods for the Statistics of Surprise and Coincidence \\", Computational Linguistics, Volume 19, issue 1 (March, 1993). introduced the test to the computational linguistics community where it is now widely used.

Machine heads are used on mandolins, guitars, double basses, and others, and are usually located on the instrument's headstock. Other names for guitar tuners include pegs, gears, machines, cranks, knobs, tensioners, and tighteners. Non-geared tuning devices as used on violins, violas, cellos, lutes, older Flamenco guitars, and ukuleles are known as friction pegs, which hold the string to tension by way of friction caused by their tapered shape and by the string pull created by the tight string.  Construction and action  Machine heads on a double bass Traditionally, a single machine head consists of a cylinder or capstan, mounted at the center of a pinion gear, a knob or \\"button\\" and a worm gear that links them. The capstan has a hole through the far end from the gear, and the string is made to go through that hole, and is wrapped around the capstan. To complete the string installation, the string is tightened by turning the capstan using the tuning knob. The worm gear ensures that the capstan cannot turn without a movement on the knob; it also allows precise tuning. Banjos usually employ a different mechanism using planetary gears - in this case the knob and the capstan both rotate on the same axis. A few guitars (e.g. the original Gibson Firebird, early Gibson basses and Mario Maccaferri's plastic instruments) have used this design. The guitarist adjusts the tension of the various strings using the knobs so that they are correctly tuned: a higher tension yields a sharper pitch, a lower tension a flatter pitch. Typical tensions for steel-string acoustic guitars with \\"light\\" tension strings are 10.5 kgf (23.3 lbf, 103 N) to 13.8 kgf (30.2 lbf, 135 N).  Varieties  Several kinds of machine head apparatus exist: * on classical guitars (with nylon strings), the worm gears are generally exposed; the strings are wound on the pins inside grooves in the head; * on modern steel-string guitars, including \\"folk\\" acoustic and electric guitars, the worm gears are generally placed in individual sealed enclosures with permanent lubrication, although budget models may have exposed gears fixed on plates housing a row of gears. Vintage and vintage-reproduction guitars frequently have individual open-gear tuners, enclosed tuners not having become common until after WWII. Several machine head placements are possible, depending on the shape of the headstock: ** rectangular head, 2 rows of 3 pins (or 6 pins for 12-string guitars): found on most \\"Folk\\" and \\"Jazz\\" guitars and on Gibson Les Paul guitars; ** a single diagonal row of 6 pins: found on Fender Telecaster and Stratocaster guitars; ** one diagonal row of four pins and one diagonal row of two pins: found on Music Man guitars; * on bass guitars, where string tension is extremely high, larger, heavier-duty machine heads than those used on guitars are used. Bass tuners generally feature larger knobs than guitar tuners as well; often these are distinctively shaped, and known as \\"elephant ears.\\" Gear ratios of 20:1 are used often. Exposed gears are much more common in premium bass guitars than in six string non-bass instruments. The machine heads on a classical guitar. Note the exposed gears and the decorations. Martin EB18 bass guitar headstock, showing Martin open type machine heads. The reverse of the machine heads on a \\"folk\\" steel-string acoustic guitar. Note the enclosed gears. On some guitars, such as those with Floyd Rose bridge, string tuning may be also conducted using microtuning tuners incorporated into the guitar bridge. Likewise, 'headless' guitars and basses, notably those designed by Steinberger and their licensed imitations, such as the Hohner Jack Bass, and unlicensed imitations such as the Washburn Bantam, have the machine heads at the body end. Steinbergers and Hohners require specialist double-ball end strings, whereas the Washburn Bantam can take regular strings. Presently, most worm- gear tuners provide a gear ratio of 14:1. In older designs, 12:1 was common, and lower ratios as well. Lower ratios allow a replacement string to be brought more quickly up to pitch, though with less precision for fine-tuning. Lower ratios are also more forgiving of imperfect machining, and of factors that might compromise the gear surfaces (corrosion, grit, poor lubrication). As increased precision of milling became more cost-effective, higher ratios appeared on the market, with 14:1 being the modern standard, trading accuracy against slower initial string winding. More recently, versions with an 18:1 gear ratio are available (particularly from Grover), and the Gotoh 510 offers 21:1. =Locking tuners= The term \\"locking tuners\\" has two meanings. Presently, it refers to some sort of mechanism in the string peg (usually a cam or screw) that locks the string in place, preventing slippage. With the popular increase of extreme vibrato-arm usage in the 1980s, several manufacturers introduced a modified design, commonly called locking machine heads, where the individual tuner has an additional mechanism to lock the string in place and stabilize tuning, primarily intended for musicians who make regular use of the vibrato. Some designs increase string breakage at the point they grip the string. The term \\"locking\\" is much older, possibly originating with Grover, and refers to an \\"anti-backlash\\" design of the gears, which greatly reduced the slippage of the basic worm-and-gear system. The gear's teeth are shaped to lock into those of the worm, with the string tension insufficient to overcome the friction between the gears. Such a design is called self-locking. Grover Rotomatics and similar designs from other manufacturers are rightly called \\"locking tuners.\\"  Resistance to usage  Musicians playing certain instrumental families, most notably the violin family (excepting the double bass) remain resistant to the use of machine heads, insisting on the continued use of friction pegs. The fitting of them on instruments in these families is often regarded as 'blasphemous'. Such factors as appearance, tradition, and simplicity, among others, are cited as justification. This resistance remains despite the well-known issues with friction pegs losing tuning, coming loose, or jamming. In the early 2000s, a new type of machine head, utilizing micro-gearing inside of a friction-peg shaped casing that can be fitting to an instrument without physical alterations was introduced, and continues to be refined, but this technology is also facing resistance.  Innovators  * Cittern maker John Preston is often credited with a linear-pull tuning machine, appearing in the latter 1700s * Johann Georg Stauffer (1778-1853) was an Austrian luthier generally credited with creating the worm-and-gear tuning machine * the \\"Stauffer-style\\" tuner was brought to the United States by Christian Frederick Martin, founder of Martin Guitars (1833) * John Kluson established a Chicago machine shop in 1925, specifically for making tuning machines, with the \\"Kluson-style\\" design having each mechanism enclosed in a stamped-sheetmetal shell * A.D. Grover (1865-1927) held at least fifty patents for musical instrument parts and accessories. The company he founded (now Grover Musical Products) continued to refine the machine-head concept through the 20th century, particularly a design with the mechanism sealed in a cast-metal shell  See also  * Tuning mechanisms for stringed instruments for other mechanisms * Schaller Electronic GmbH, a manufacturer  References  Category:String instrument construction Category:Guitar parts and accessories mk:Штимер pl:Stroik (chordofony) pt:Cravelha ","title":"Machine head"},{"id":"914827","text":"Splodgenessabounds are an English punk rock band formed in Peckham, South London. The band is associated with the Oi! and punk pathetique genres. Their frontman is Max Splodge (born Martin Everest) . They have scored three UK Singles Chart entries, including one Top 10 hit and a second Top 30 hit. Career The band was formed over a cab office called Baron Cars in Queens Road, Peckham. The band were originally fronted by Max Splodge and his girlfriend of the time, who was known as Baby Greensleeves. The band won a recording contract with Deram Records after finishing runner-up in the 1979 Battle Of The Bands contest, even though Deram was planning to cease all activities in the music markets outside of classical music. The band's first release for Deram in 1980 was \\"Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please\\". The song was released as a triple A side vinyl single, along with \\"Simon Templer\\" (a pastiche of the theme tune of the TV series, Return of the Saint featuring the character Simon Templar) and \\"Michael Booth's Talking Bum\\". \\"Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please\\" was the only song from that release that picked up any airplay, first from John Peel on his BBC Radio 1 show, and later on daytime radio as a novelty song. The song peaked at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1980, however the band members were unable to capitalise on their success by appearing on Top of the Pops, because the show was off the air due to strike action at the BBC Television. The follow-up to \\"Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please\\" was a cover version of \\"Two Little Boys\\" (a live version that appeared in the soundtrack to the 1981 film, Urgh! A Music War). It was a quadruple A-side, with \\"Horse\\" , \\"The Butterfly Song\\" and \\"Sox\\". The initial copies of the single came with a cardboard boomerang, 'guaranteed not to come back'. The band then performed on Top of the Pops, but the single only reached No. 26 in September 1980. Their eponymous debut album (released in January 1981 when the band was on hiatus) failed to chart. In the band's early days, they were noted for playing pranks. These included leaving Splodge stranded on top of a set of speakers for an entire set; supporting themselves when the support band failed to show by playing the wrong instruments badly at deafening volume levels; and a stunt where Splodge was rumoured to be held in Maidstone Prison and came on stage handcuffed to a prison officer. Splodgenessabounds' stage show sometimes went to carnivalesque extremes. Police were frequenting their concerts, due to unsubstantiated reports of public nudity and \\"farting on demand\\" during renditions of \\"Michael Booth's Talking Bum\\".. The group often made humorously grandiose press release claims, such as that their debut album would be a triple, including a side of \\"old material transcribed from their own cassettes, coupled with their 'Pathetic Movements Manifesto', and including a free Christmas tree with every copy.\\" Splodge got back into the studio – having lost the rest of his band in 1980 – with help from the Heavy Metal Kids, whose lead singer and guitarist Gary Holton was a friend of Splodge and sometime member of Splodgenessabounds. Their single \\"Cowpunk Medlum\\" (a medley of the theme song of the Western film High Noon , a section of \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\" and the TV series Bonanza) reached No. 69 in June 1981, but after this, Deram terminated the band's recording contract. Nevertheless, the new Splodgenessabounds (temporarily shortened to Splodge for legal reasons) released a follow-up single, \\"Mouth and Trousers\\", along with the album In Search of the Seven Golden Gussets on the independent Razor Records. Despite the single getting good airplay and favourable reviews (being a ska song rather than their usual punk style), without the backing of Deram Records, it became the first Splodgenessabounds single to fail to chart. A new album, A Nightmare on Rude Street was recorded in 1991, but sales and reviews were poor. Splodge continued the band with various line-ups also pursuing his career as an actor and bingo caller, as well as playing with Angelic Upstarts. In 1999, after going for a DNA blood test, Splodge discovered he was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. Splodge penned five songs: \\"Genghis Khan\\", \\"Lulluby of Mongolia\\", \\"These Are the Things That Make the Mongols So Great\\", \\"Too Mongolia\\" and \\"Mongols on the Streets of London\\" (written with Mat Sargent of Sham 69). Two subsequent albums I Don't Know (2000) and The Artful Splodger (2001) recorded and produced by Dave Goodman, were released by Captain Oi! Records. The albums sold well and the band did two UK and European tours, and also appeared in Canada and the United States. A live show in Brighton was released on DVD in 2005 and featured Motörhead guitarist Würzel who often guested with Splodge, and also a joint single with John Otway, \\"No Offence – None Taken\\", (available for download only). In 2006, the band appeared on Harry Hill's TV Burp, after being featured on Rock School with Gene Simmons. Splodgenessabounds performed at the end of the show, accompanied by Hill dressed as \\"The Demon\\", Gene Simmons. In 2008, Splodge recorded a new song; \\"You've Been Splodged\\", this was released on an Oi compilation album. In 2012, Splodge recorded a Christmas song that appeared on a punk compilation album called Cashing In On Christmas, which was released on Black Hole Records. Splodge can still be found touring with Bad Manners and, in 2013, it was announced that Splodgenessabounds would play the Rebellion Festival for the 19th time since the Festival started in 1996 as Holidays In The Sun (HITS). Splodgenessabounds are one of only two bands (along with 999) to have played the festival every year. Max also hosts the bingo at the festival which opens the acoustic stage each day.

His other occupations were as a Rochdale hairdresser and newsagent. Personal life Born in Balderstone, Rochdale on 4 October 1874, he first worked in a series of jobs as a casual labourer in and around Manchester before gaining a job at a spinning mill in Bury. After another stint in a factory he decided to follow his father's trade by becoming a barber and hairdresser in Rochdale, where he subsequently also opened a newsagent's shop, which he ran with his wife and children. Career At the age of 22 he applied to the Home Office to become an executioner and was invited to attend training at Newgate Prison. He first participated in an execution in Newcastle in December 1901, as assistant to William Billington. Ellis served as Chief Executioner from 1907 and was involved in a total of 203 executions. Among the executions he performed were those of Hawley Harvey Crippen (known as Dr. Crippen) in 1910, Frederick Seddon in 1912, Sir Roger Casement in 1916, Herbert Rowse Armstrong in 1922, and of Edith Thompson in 1923. He took the responsibility of his position very seriously and hoped to \\"despatch\\" the condemned person with as little fuss and pain to the individual concerned as possible. The ordeal of executing Edith Thompson in 1923 had a profound effect on Ellis. Thompson had collapsed in terror at the prospect of her hanging and, unconscious, had to be supported on the gallows by four prison warders. Various accounts report, \\"that guards had to tie her to a small wooden chair before drawing the noose around her neck\\", and that \\"she was hanged in a bosun's chair\\". On 27 March 1956, the then Home Secretary Major Lloyd George stated in a Written Answer in the Commons \\"that the Governor of Holloway Prison, who was also the Medical Officer, ... gave Mrs. Thompson sedatives\\" and that \\"although he thought she could have walked with assistance, he had her carried and she was supported on the scaffold. Apart from this, nothing unusual occurred.\\" When the gallows trapdoor opened and Thompson fell, the sudden impact of the noose caused her to suffer a massive vaginal haemorrhage. The large amount of blood spilled, combined with the fact that Thompson had gained weight during her imprisonment even while resisting food, led to conjecture that she might have been pregnant, although no post- mortem examination was made. All women hanged in Britain after Thompson were required to wear a special garment made of canvas as a precaution against the problems encountered with Thompson. Resignation and death Ellis resigned from his post in the following year. Whether this was due to his experiences at the Thompson hanging is open to dispute, especially since he performed 11 more executions (among which was one of another woman) before he withdrew. Ellis took to drinking heavily, and attempted suicide in 1924 by shooting himself in the jaw. Suicide was at that time a criminal offence, and Ellis was charged and bound over for 12 months at Rochdale Magistrates Court. Eight years later, in September 1932, after another bout of heavy drinking, Ellis succeeded in his suicide attempt, cutting his throat with a razor. Controversy His relations to his fellow executioners were strained. Henry Pierrepoint was struck off the list of executioners following a complaint by Ellis. Pierrepoint, arriving at Chelmsford prison slightly intoxicated on 13 July 1910, had started a row, and would have beaten up Ellis had not warders intervened. Pierrepoint's brother Thomas, also an executioner, is reported to have said about John Ellis that \\"it was impossible to work with him\\". Insights into his behaviour, way of thinking and the methods he employed can be read in the book Diary of a Hangman, in which he describes his methods and recalls the final moments of some of those he executed.

Most of these organisms form a symbiotic relationship in animals; these include a variety of forms found in the intestines of termites and cockroaches, many of which have symbiotic bacteria that help them digest cellulose in woody plants. Other species within this supergroup are known parasites, and include human pathogens. Characteristics Parabasalia cell scheme (Trichomonas). 1-anterior flagella, 2-kinetosomes, 3-parabasal body, 4-costa, 5-parabasal fibers, 6-undulating membrane, 7-posterior flagellum, 8-hydrogenosomes, 9-axostyle, 10-nucleus, 11-pelta. The flagella are arranged in one or more clusters near the anterior of the cell. Their basal bodies are linked to parabasal fibers that attach to prominent Golgi complexes, distinctive to the group. Usually they also give rise to a sheet of cross-like microtubules that runs down the center of the cell and in some cases projects past the end. This is called the axostyle, but is different in structure from the axostyles of oxymonads. Parabasalids are anaerobic, and lack mitochondria, but this is now known to be a result of secondary loss, and they contain small hydrogenosomes which apparently developed from reduced mitochondria. Similar relics have been found in other amitochondriate flagellates, and the parabasalids are probably related to them, forming a group called the metamonads. They lack the feeding grooves found in most others, but this is probably a secondary loss as well. Classification The parabasalids are currently divided into about 7 to 10 orders depending on sources. * The trichomonads have one group of 4-6 flagella, one of which is attached to the side of the cell and often forms an undulating membrane. Many are found in vertebrate hosts, including Trichomonas vaginalis, which causes a sexually transmitted disease in humans. * The other orders, formerly grouped as the hypermastigids, have a large number of flagellar clusters and are found exclusively in the guts of insects.

Interstellar scintillation is the observed effect of interference and refractive phenomena due to the ISM. It can be thought of as the ISM focusing and defocusing the radio waves from the source, producing a pattern of dark and bright patches, rather like light and dark patches at the bottom of a fish pond. As the Earth moves through these patches we observe a temporal variation in the radio intensity (like a fish swimming through light and dark patches). If the standard theory of diffractive scintillation is assumed to apply, ground-based radio traces would seem to require that J1819+3845 contains a component that must be less than about 5 microarcseconds across; this would require its temperature to be in excess of 1015 K. However, the scintillation may perhaps be interpreted as being due to an unusual piece of intervening interstellar medium. Nonetheless, its importance lies in having proved the importance of interstellar scintillation in creating the observed variations in brightness in at least some quasars, which had been the subject of some discussion.

The suffix -monas ( – single unit), describes its similarity to unicellular organisms from the genus Monas. Habitat and ecology Trichomonas is typically found in anaerobic environments. It is a known parasite of many different animals including humans, birds, dogs, and cats. In humans, it can be found in the urogenital tract and in the oral cavity. It is estimated that 276 million new cases of urogenital infections occur each year. Depending on the Trichomonas species, it can either be transmitted through direct sexual contact or through contaminated water sources. In birds, it can be found in the upper digestive tract and is transmitted when adult birds regurgitate food to feed their young, when a bird of prey feeds on an infected bird, and through contaminated food or water. Morphology Trichomonas is around 10 µm in length and is normally pear-shaped. It has four flagella at its anterior end, distinguishing itself from closely related organisms that have different numbers of anterior flagella. At the base of these flagella are the parabasal bodies, kinetosomes accompanied by Golgi stacks. The pelta is a sheet of microtubules that curve around the flagellar bases. Posterior to the pelta is the axostyle, is a bundle of microtubules that extends from the anterior end of the organism all the way to the posterior end. The nucleus of Trichomonas is situated close to where the pelta and axostyle meet. Another distinguishing feature of Trichomonas is the presence of an undulating membrane. The undulating membrane is a fin-like extension of the plasma membrane located on the side of the organism. A flagellum that extends to the posterior end of the organism is attached to the outer edge of the undulating membrane. At the base of the undulating membrane is a striated fiber called the costa which is thought to exist for structural support. Trichomonas has a very interesting organelle: the hydrogenosome. Hydrogenosomes are double-membraned organelles used by Trichomonas instead of mitochondria to produce ATP. They do not require oxygen and instead use pyruvate:ferredoxin oxido-reductase and hydrogenase to produce ATP from pyruvate, generating hydrogen gas as a by-product. Genetics Trichomonas vaginalis, being the species that causes the most complications in humans, is the only fully sequenced Trichomonas species. Through whole-genome shotgun sequencing, the Trichomonas vaginalis genome is estimated to be around 160 Mb long, divided in six chromosomes. However, at least 65% of its genome was found to be redundant. The redundant genetic material is hypothesized to have emerged during Trichomonas's transition from aerobic to anaerobic environments. In addition to discovering the large proportion of repetitive DNA in Trichomonas vaginalis genome, the sequenced genes were also characterized. Approximately 60,000 protein-coding genes were found. Transfer RNAs for all 20 amino acids and approximately 250 ribosomal RNA were all found on the same chromosome. Life cycle Trichomonas has a trophozoite form, its pear-shaped form, which is most commonly observed, and an amoeboid form, which appears during host colonization. It lacks a cyst form, but many studies have noted a unique form in which Trichomonas appears ovoidal rather than its typical pear-shaped form. In this ovoidal form, all its flagella are retracted in endocytic vacuoles, giving the impression of a cystic form. However, due to the lack of a cystic wall surrounding the organism, many studies describe this form as a pseudocystic form. In its trophozoite form, Trichomonas undergoes cell division through an interesting process called cryptopleuromitosis. There are three common forms of mitosis: open, closed, and semi-open. In open mitosis, the nuclear envelope disappears so that mitotic spindles can interact with the chromosomes. In closed mitosis, the nuclear envelope does not disappear but mitotic spindles appear within the nucleus to separate the chromosomes. In semi-open mitosis, the nuclear envelope remains intact but the mitotic spindles pierce through the nuclear envelope to divide the chromosomes. Cryptopleuromitosis is different from all the other more commonly known methods of cell division. In cryptopleuromitosis, the chromosomes divide without the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and without the entry of mitotic spindles into the nucleus. Diseases Trichomonas causes disease in humans and in birds. In humans, the causative species is Trichomonas vaginalis and Trichomonas tenax. In birds, the causative species are Trichomonas gallinae, Trichomonas gypactinii, and Trichomonas stableri. =In humans= Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted disease and causes trichomoniasis. It resides on squamous epithelium of the urogenital tract. Many carriers of Trichomonas vaginalis, especially men, are asymptomatic. Complications for symptomatic women include vaginitis, endometritis, infertility, and cervical cancer. Complications for symptomatic men include urethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, and infertility. It is also associated with increased risk of transmission and acquisition of HIV. Trichomonas tenax is transmitted through exchange of saliva and contaminated water sources. It is an opportunistic pathogen and may cause pulmonary trichomoniasis. =In birds= Trichomonas in birds inhabit the upper digestive tract and also cause trichomoniasis. It creates lesions in the trachea and esophagus, thus occupying space and eventually causing emaciation and asphyxiation. Species * Trichomonas brixi — inhabits the oral cavity of dogs and cats. * Trichomonas gallinae — inhabits the upper digestive tract of primarily pigeons and doves, but also other birds. * Trichomonas gypactinii — inhabits the upper digestive tract of scavenging birds of prey, such as vultures. * Trichomonas stableri — inhabits the upper digestive tract of pigeons. * Trichomonas tenax — inhabits the oral cavity of humans. * Trichomonas vaginalis — inhabits the urogenital tract of humans.

It has three life cycle forms: the amoeboid stage, the cyst stage, and the flagellated stage, and has been routinely studied for its ease in change from amoeboid to flagellated stages. The Naegleria genera became famous when Naegleria fowleri, a human pathogenic strain and the causative agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), was discovered in 1965. Most species in the genus, however, are non pathogenic.  Etymology  The genus Naegleria is named after the French zoologist, Mathieu Naegler.  History  In 1899, Franz Schardinger discovered an amoeba that had the ability to transform into a flagellated stage. He named the organism Amoeba gruberi, which was later changed to the genus Naegleria in 1912 by Alexeieff. Before 1970, the genus was generally used as a model organism to study the changes from amoeboid to flagellated stages. However it garnered much more attention when a human pathogenic species (Naegleria fowleri) was discovered in Australia in 1965, and described in 1970.  Habitat and ecology  Naegleria is found worldwide in typically aerobic warm aquatic environments (freshwater such as lakes and rivers) and soil habitats. As a typically free living genus, it feeds on bacteria and can be maintained on a diet of gram negative bacteria. It feeds via phagocytosis. The few species that are pathogenic seem to be characteristically thermophilic, preferring warmer temperatures such as nuclear power plant cooling water. One species, Naegleria fowleri, can be an opportunistic pathogen of humans where if it enters the nasal cavity may travel to the brain and feast on tissues of the olfactory bulbs first, and then move to consuming the rest of the brain, beginning with the meninges.  Description of organism  = Morphology/anatomy = Naegleria are free- living amoebae, with some strains being opportunistic pathogens. Cells range from 10-25 um depending on the life stage it is currently in. Species are not classified morphologically anymore but historically have been by flagellar shape. New species are often defined by ribosomal DNA sequences. The unicellular organism's cytoplasm has distinct separations of an ectoplasm (outer) and endoplasm (inner). As a mitochondriate, aerobic organism it has many mitochondria in the endoplasm. The endoplasm also contains ribosomes, food vacuoles, contractile filaments/vacuoles, and protoplasmic filaments. Notably, Golgi is not visibly identifiable although expression of Golgi- associated machinery has been identified. It has a nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. = Life cycles = Naegleria has 3 different life cycle stages: amoebae, cyst, and flagellate. The amoebae stage is the feeding stage and has blunt pseudopodia (lobopodia) that give the cell an overall irregular, yet generally cylindrical shape. The overall size is usually around 10-20 um at this stage. The pseudopodia are actin based extensions of the body and form at irregular regions of the cell. Movement occurs in this stage via extending the pseudopodia, and having the cytoplasmic internal contents follow subsequently. As the feeding stage of the organism, pseudopodia are also used to engulf prey, such as bacteria. This is also the stage that the organism spends the most time in, and also the reproductive phase. Reproduction occurs here by binary fission and it can reproduce every 1.6 hours on a bacterial diet. Reproductive division involves promitosis, or intranuclear mitosis, which does not occur with nuclear envelope breakdown. Sexual reproduction has not been observed in this genus but the genes for meiosis do exist in the genome. The cyst stage is a double walled spherical stage. The double wall consists of a thick endocyst and a thin endocyst. The cyst contains usually 2-8 pores (often depending on the species) and is formed when conditions become adverse, such as residing in non optimal temperature. Cysts are favourable as they are naturally resistant to environmental hardships. When adverse conditions are restored to normal, the organism can escape the cyst through the pores in its amoeboid form. Cysts have been observed to be formed in all but one species where the ability to form a cyst is inhibited by a bacterial parasite. The flagellate stage consists of two flagella which are induced by de novo assembly of a primarily microtubule cytoskeleton from a former actin based cytoskeleton (from the amoeboid form). The microtubule skeleton is prominent along with the development of basal bodies. The entire flagellar structure consists of 200 proteins. Division of the organism does not occur in this life stage, although two species have been found to divide as an exception. There is no cytostome (feeding groove) present suggesting that feeding occurs primarily in the amoeboid stage via phagocytosis. There is a single nucleus which is near the flagellar root. The flagellated stage is typically encountered when the genus needs to move to a more desirable location, which is often encountered when conditions are not optimal. Therefore, this flagellated stage is transient and the organism usually reverts to the amoeboid form within an hour, with transformation taking about 100 minutes. The reversion to the amoeboid form can be induced by changes in ionic concentration of the water it resides in (such as placing it in distilled water). Notably, five species have never been observed in this flagellate life stage. = Genetics = The genome of Naegleria gruberi has been sequenced and consists of a 41 Mb nuclear genome with 15,727 protein-coding genes. It has a 33% GC content, and 57.8% of the genome is coding with about 36% consisting of introns. This suggests a mean of about 0.7 introns per gene. There are at least 12 chromosomes present. About 1% of the genes have homology to bacterial genes suggesting that lateral gene transfer may have occurred at some point. The genome also notably contains the required genes for Golgi but it is visibly lacking. Although only seen to be asexual, meiotic genes are also present. Compared to other protists, Naegleria also has a larger set of mitochondrial genes with about a 50 kb mitochondrial genome. The mitochondrial genome clearly encodes for aerobic respiration which is seen through its ability to perform oxidative phosphorylation and use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. Remarkably the organism's genome also encodes for an elaborate anaerobic metabolism such as substrate-level phosphorylation and an ability to use fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. This anaerobic system is hypothesized to be used in slightly anoxic muddy environments during the cyst life stage. The genus Naegleria’s ribosomal DNA (rDNA) consists of an extrachromosomal plasmid of which about 4000 exist in each cell. Comparison of 5.8S rDNA is the current way of molecularly classifying new species. Species can also be distinguished by their internal transcribed spacers type 2 (ITS2) sequences. = Practical importance = One species of Naegleria is known to be a potential pathogen to humans — Naegleria fowleri. It is typically free living, but is a thermophilic parasite if it encounters the right host. Besides being found in freshwater, it can also be found in warm water of industrial plants, as well as poorly chlorinated swimming pools. It enters through the nose of the host (who is typically found to be in contact through warm water such as thermal nuclear plant cooling water), and attaches to the olfactory epithelium where it goes to the brain by locomotion (pseudopodia). There it destroys neurons and causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a very rare, yet fatal disease. PAM shows symptoms very similar to bacterial meningitis. N. fowleri is one of four known free living amoebae found in association with human disease. The end result is almost always death, even in healthy people. N. fowleri possess secreted proteases, phospholipases, and pore-forming peptides which are characteristics of a pathogenic process. Two other species, Naegleria austerealiensis and Naegleria italica have been shown to produce disease in experimental animals. They have been observed to cause central nervous system (CNS) infections in animals such as mice, rats, squirrels, guinea pigs, sheep, as well as the gills of fish. Another practical importance of the genus is that it is extensively studied for its transformation from the amoeboid phase into the flagellated stage, which can be difficult to induce in other genera. The transformation from flagellate to amoeboid stage can be induced by changes in ionic concentration, such as placing the organism in distilled water making it a great model organism for doing so. = List of species (or lower taxonomic units) = 47 species of Naegleria have been described. These include: * Naegleria americana * Naegleria andersoni * Naegleria angularis * Naegleria antarctica * Naegleria arctica * Naegleria australiensis * Naegleria byersi * Naegleria canariensis * Naegleria carteri * Naegleria chilensis * Naegleria clarki * Naegleria dobsoni * Naegleria dunnebackei * Naegleria endoi * Naegleria fowleri * Naegleria fultoni * Naegleria galeacystis * Naegleria gallica * Naegleria gruberi * Naegleria indonesiensis * Naegleria italica * Naegleria jadini * Naegleria jamiesoni * Naegleria johanseni * Naegleria laresi * Naegleria lovaniensis * Naegleria martinezi * Naegleria mexicana * Naegleria minor * Naegleria morganensis * Naegleria neoantarctica * Naegleria neochilensis * Naegleria neodobsoni * Naegleria neopolaris * Naegleria niuginensis * Naegleria pagei * Naegleria paradobsoni * Naegleria peruana * Naegleria philippinensis * Naegleria polaris * Naegleria pringsheimi * Naegleria pussardi * Naegleria robinsoni * Naegleria schusteri * Naegleria spitzbergeniensis * Naegleria sturti * Naegleria tenerifensis * Naegleria tihangensis References Further reading * * External links *Naegleria - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention * http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/naegleria.htm Category:Percolozoa Category:Excavata genera ","title":"Naegleria"},{"id":"914851","text":"John de Halton (died 1324), also called John de Halghton, was an English priest and Bishop of Carlisle from 1292 to 1324.

He was present at Berwick when Edward decided that the throne of Scotland should go to John Balliol. Halton spent much of the time between 1292 and 1295 in Scotland, for Pope Nicholas IV had appointed Halton to collect the crusading tax that the pope had imposed. However, when England and Scotland went to war in 1296, Halton returned to his diocese and remained there.

She was launched on 10 April 1944 as a Victory ship, the SS Colombia Victory, to carry cargo for World War II. She was transferred to the US Navy in 1951. Ship's history SS Colombia Victory, fourth ship, Hull No. MCV-10 and other Victory cargo ships are lined up at a U.S. west coast shipyard =Construction= Betelgeuse was a constructed by the California Shipbuilding Company, Los Angeles, California and commissioned in the merchant service as SS Colombia Victory in May, 1944. From 1944 through 1948, she was operated by the Grace Steamship Company, the Waterman Steamship Corporation and the Isthmian Steamship Company. In 1948, she was placed in Maritime Reserve Fleet until 1951 when she was purchased by the U.S. Government and converted for Navy use. World War II - SS Colombia Victory As a U.S. Merchant Marine ship SS Colombia Victory was very active during World War II in the Pacific War Operations. The SS Colombia Victory had the dangerous job of delivering ammunition for troops in the Pacific during World War II. Her Naval Armed Guard crews earned \\"Battle Stars\\" for participating in the Assault-Occupation of Iwo Jima from 25 February to 6 March 1945. On March 1, 1945 she was delivering ammo to the Marines on the beach of Iwo Jima. Shore batteries opened fire on her and hit a worker on the aft deck. She was able to quickly turn around and move out of the fire range. She also to supplies to the Battle of Okinawa and Occupation of Okinawa from 27 May to 4 June 1945. As Merchant Marine ship she was operated by three companies: The Ishmian SS Corporation, The Waterman SS Corporation and the Grace Lines.The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine, By Brian Herbert, page 117 After the war in 1948, she was laid up Wilmington, Delaware as part of the United States Navy reserve fleets.MARINERS, THE WEBSITE OF THE MARINERS MAILING LIST., VICTORY SHIPS USS Betelgeuse On 15 April 1952 at Savannah, Georgia, she was commissioned by the Navy as the USS Betelgeuse (AK-260) and placed under operational control of the Service Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, with Commander L.A. Parker, U.S. Navy, commanding. Cargo ships, like Betelgeuse, were named after heavenly bodies; Betelgeuse being a large star in the constellation Orion. From her commissioning in 1952 through 1960, \\"Goose\\" made resupply missions to the Caribbean and the Mediterranean with occasional trips to base in the West Indies, Bermuda, and the Azores. While performing her mission as a Navy Cargo ship, Betelgeuse transferred practically every kind of cargo to ships, barges, and piers using every known transfer method. =1960s= Conversion for Polaris support In the summer of 1960, a significant modification was accomplished when Betelgeuse was modified to carry Polaris missiles and components in support of the Fleet Ballistic Missile program. This modification changed the mission of Betelgeuse from a fleet resupply ship to a link in the Polaris program. After two years of operation as a Polaris resupply ship, Betelgeuse entered the shipyard for further modifications keyed to a more efficient stowage and transfer of Polaris missiles and their components. The major undertaking of this modification was the installation of vertical stowage of the Polaris missiles in Number Three hold. During the period 1 June through 7 September 1962, Betelgeuse, along with a normal overhaul, was again converted. Number Three hold received another major conversion, this time to the new concept of vertical stowage and transport of missiles. With this conversion, Betelgeuse could now transport fourteen (14) missiles in Number Three hold, five (5) missiles (in containers), in Number Four hold, and four (4) missiles (in containers) on the main deck, one on each side of both Number Four and Five hatch, for a total capacity of twenty-three (23) missiles. 1962 operations Commencing in 1962, Betelgeuse (AK-260) made resupply runs to Holy Loch, Scotland and Naval Station Rota, Spain. She not only carried Polaris missiles and their components, but she also carried food, repair parts, clothing, fuel and many other items which enabled the Polaris submarines to operate from a mobile base. 1965–1966 operations From December 1965 through March 1966, Betelgeuse underwent a regular overhaul at Detyen's Shipyard, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Betelgeuse was the first major ship to be overhauled at this shipyard and the largest ship ever to navigate the Wando River to the shipyard site. During the overhaul, two men earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for risking their lives in a successful rescue of two shipyard workers from a fume filled tank of an aviation gas barge. Betelgeuse underwent refresher training in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in June 1966 following an FBM (Fleet Ballistic Missile) resupply voyage to Rota, Spain in May with a four-day operational visit to Barcelona, Spain. Two FBM resupply voyages were made to Holy Loch, Scotland in July and September and an operational visit to Portsmouth, England. Two more FBM resupply voyages were made to Rota, Spain in October and November prior to going into upkeep and leave period in Charleston, South Carolina for the month of December. 1967 operations Betelgeuse (AK-260) was a unit of Service Squadron Eight until 1 July 1967 and then was transferred to Commander Submarine Force, US Atlantic Fleet and placed under the operational control of Commander Submarine Flotilla Six at Charleston, South Carolina. From 1 January 1967 until 30 August 1967, Betelgeuse operated with the U.S. Atlantic Submarine Force providing services as required from retrieving torpedoes during target services to replenishment of the Polaris sit at Charleston, SC, with the exception of the period 4–22 June 1967 when Betelgeuse participated in Operation \\"New Look\\". While on Operation \\"New Look\\", Betelgeuse was granted a port visit to New York City. Collision with Simon Bolivar While conducting submarine services in August 1967, Betelgeuse was involved in a collision with the submarine which was submerged. Extensive damage to the underwater hull caused immediate flooding in Number Three hold with resultant leaks into Number Two hold and the engine room. There were no personnel injuries and Betelgeuse was able to return to Charleston under her own power and entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for repairs during the period of 1 September through 8 October 1967. On 9 October 1967, Betelgeuse conducted sea trials with outstanding results. 1967 operations In October 1967, Betelgeuse made an FBM resupply trip to Rota, Spain. Upon returning to Charleston, Betelgeuse commenced loading for a replenishment trip to Bangor, Washington via the Panama Canal for the first WESTLANT/EASTPAC replenishment, transiting the Panama Canal 17 November and arriving in Bangor, Washington 27 November. While in Washington, a visit to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard had to be made to repair a leaky economizer tube in Number One boiler. On the return trip to Charleston, a one-day port visit was made of Balboa, Panama. 1968 operations From January 1968 through April 1968, Betelgeuse provided target services and retrieved torpedoes for submarines, performed site replenishment of the Polaris site at Charleston, made a liberty port visit to Miami, Florida and an FBM resupply to Holy Loch, Scotland. A dependent's cruise was conducted on 26 July 1968 and a liberty port visit was made to Fort Lauderdale, Florida in August and another FBM resupply was made to Holy Loch, Scotland at the end of August 1968. Betelgeuse participated in the first operational test of the fleet Ballistic missile system for Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet in October and November 1968. Rescue of Spirit of Love crew Departing Charleston on 15 November 1968 for Holy Loch, Scotland, Betelgeuse came in contact with a 35-foot sailboat Sprit of Love foundering off course approximately 300 miles northeast of Bermuda on 18 November. Spirit of Love had departed New York for St. Thomas, Virgin Islands on 2 November. The three crewmen were taken on board and the sailboat taken in tow. The Master had advised that the boat's engine was inoperative, sails gone, water and cooking fuel depleted and only about two days food remained on board and the crew had been bailing for the past five days. While in tow in heavy seas and taking on water, Spirit of Love sank. The three crewmen were transferred via helicopter to the and then flown to Bermuda. Betelgeuse resumed her track to Holy Loch, Scotland, arriving 0n 26 November. On 8 December 1968, Betelgeuse entered dry-dock in the at Holy Loch. After undocking on 20 December, Betelgeuse departed for Charleston and arrived 1 January 1969. 1969 operations During 1969, Betelgeuse twice provided target services and retrieved torpedoes for submarines and participated in two operational tests of the fleet ballistic missile system as down range support ship and once again a liberty port visit was made to Miami, Florida. Betelgeuse went through a shipyard overhaul in Charleston Naval Shipyard from May through August 1969 in which $1,543,704 were spent in repairs and preservation of the ship. In December 1969, Betelgeuse went through refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. =1970s= From 1 January through 31 March 1970, Betelgeuse made one FBM site replenishment to Rota, Spain and two FBM site replenishments to Holy Loch, Scotland. While underway on the second trip to Holy Loch on 28 February, after experiencing heavy seas for several days, the weather appeared to be clearing and the seas calming when the ship rode up on an unusually large wave of about 60 feet and pounded heavily, resulting in the rupture of a fuel tank under Number One hold. Arriving on 4 March, temporary repairs were made at Holy Loch. The ship then returned to Charleston arriving 21 March for dry-docking and permanent repairs. During the months of April, May, August, and September, Betelgeuse was downrange support ship for operational tests of the fleet ballistic system for Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. An operational visit was made to Ponta Delgada, São Miguel, Azores during the first test. Deactivation and decommissioning Betelgeuse experimentally mothballed. The Sub-Board of Inspection and Survey, Atlantic conducted a pre-inactivation inspection during the period 21–23 September 1970 and found Betelgeuse fit for further service provided three deficiencies were corrected. On 15 October 1970, operational control of Betelgeuse shifted to Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility Portsmouth, Charleston Detachment and became inactive to prepare to enter the mothball fleet. Betelgeuse was formally decommissioned on 15 January 1971. LCDR Robert L. Jerns, as Commanding Officer, received the commissioning pennant. BM1 Stephen J. Meader received the ensign for having been on board the longest. Betelgeuse was towed to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 16 January 1971 and used in an experiment for encapsulation of mothballed ships. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1974. Destruction Sold for scrapping to Luria Brothers & Co. in December 1975, while being towed to Texas in January 1976, the tug boat had to cut the tow cable due to high seas and Betelgeuse ran aground at Rodanthe, NC.

The peryton is a mythological hybrid animal combining the physical features of a stag and a bird. The peryton was created and described by Jorge Luis Borges in his 1957 Book of Imaginary Beings, using a supposedly long-lost medieval manuscript as a source. Mythology The peryton is said to have the head, neck, forelegs and antlers of a stag, combined with the plumage, wings and hindquarters of a large bird, although some interpretations portray the peryton as a deer in all but coloration and bird's wings. According to Borges, perytons lived in Atlantis until an earthquake destroyed the civilization and the creatures escaped by flight. A peryton casts the shadow of a man until it kills one during its lifetime, at which time it starts to cast its own shadow. A sibyl once prophesied that the perytons would lead to the downfall of Rome. In Borges' original Spanish edition, the word is given as peritio so the presumptive Latin original would be peritius, which happens to be the Latin name of the fourth month on the ancient Macedonian calendarΠερίτιος (Peritios, moon of January). The connection of this, if any, to the peryton is unclear. In popular culture Perytons are found or used in modern literature and games. =Books and manga= * Monsters called 'perytons' appear in Diane Duane's Young Wizards series of young-adult fantasy novels as minions of the archvillain of the series; while their appearance and nature is very different from (and much darker than) the creatures describes by Borges, they still bear a number of conceptual similarities. * A peryton closely matching Borges's original description is a minor villain in The Cinnabar Box, a fantasy novel by Ilil Arbel. Uniquely, this incarnation of the monster can use and understand human speech. * A peryton is referred to in The Sword of the Lictor, a book in The Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe. In the series, a constellation is also named after the beast. * The creatures also appear in Darkwell, a book in The Moonshae Trilogy, where a flock of perytons are among an army of evil monsters summoned by the book's main antagonist. * A herd of golden-furred perytons with poisonous antlers attack the main characters in the book Fablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary while fleeing a dragon. * A murderous peryton named Orfeo is a major villain in the fantasy novel Whiskey and Water by Elizabeth Bear. * Swarms of cat-sized perytons are natural enemies of the unicorns in Peter S. Beagle's fantasy novel The Unicorn Sonata. * The peryton features in John and Carole Barrowman's novel Hollow Earth. * In the Kendra Kandlestar children's book series, perytons are somewhat arrogant and keep to themselves. They refer to earth-bound beings as \\"underlings,\\" but are herbivorous and pose no threat to humans or other creatures. * In The Outcast, a prequel to the Summoner trilogy written by Taran Matharu, a peryton is a level 9 demon favored by the Celestial Corps, and is considered the most common of the flying steeds available to Hominum's summoners. * A peryton is one of the antagonists in the urban fantasy novel Between Frames by W.R. Gingell. The Peryton in this book is described as a stag/bird hybrid with strong magic and a biological defense system that makes them look like the last person they killed. =Games= * The peryton is included among the bestiary of the game Dungeons and Dragons. Like the creature in Borges' book, it has the hindquarters of a large bird. * The peryton is included in the mythology-themed \\"Monsters of the Mind\\" subsection in the 2003 trading card game Weird n’ Wild Creatures. * The peryton is one of the monsters in the Monsters and Animals supplement for the Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game and related games from Palladium Books, and includes the \\"casts the shadow of a man\\" aspect from Borges, although the creature is depicted as a winged deer. *A peryton is featured in the text based phone game The Arcana in Muriel's route and briefly in Portia's route. Science * The term peryton is also used for radio signals of terrestrial origin that mimic fast radio bursts, pulses that appear to be coming from outside of our galaxy. These perytons were found to be the result of premature opening of a microwave oven door, which releases a frequency-swept radio pulse, which mimics a fast radio burst, as the magnetron turns off.

The village is most famous for the Tardebigge Locks, a flight of 30 canal locks that raise the Worcester and Birmingham Canal over 220 feet (67 metres) over the Lickey Ridge. It lies in the county of Worcestershire, although it was also historically an exclave of Staffordshire or Warwickshire at different times in its history. Toponymy The name Tærdebicga has no likely meaning in Old English or Celtic; Eilert Ekwall simply says it is 'unexplained'. History Tardebigge was once a much greater township, which included much of Redditch, including the modern day town-centre. Its name was recorded twice in a will as Anglo-Saxon æt Tærdebicgan. Records of the parish begin in the late 10th century. Tardebigge was bought by the Dean of Worcester for his Church from King Ethelred the Unready. In the later Dark Ages there were battles fought between Ethelred's son Edmund Ironside and the Cnut the Dane. In the 12th century, the parish was granted to Bordesley Abbey, a Roman Catholic monastery. For three hundred years the area remained in the Church's possession. In 1538 the Roman Catholic Church was disestablished by King Henry VIII, and the area became the possession of The Crown, until under an arrangement with Henry, the possessions of Bordesley Abbey passed to Andrew Lord Windsor, and therefore to the stewardship of the Earl of Plymouth at adjacent Hewell Grange. The land was gradually managed and sold off by the Earl; it was not until the mid 19th century that the parish of Tardebigge began to dissolve and the modern boundaries began to appear. St Bartholomew's Church The local parish church of St Bartholomew by Francis Hiorne of 1777 contains an impressive monument to Sir Thomas Cookes, 2nd Baronet, the benefactor of Worcester College, Oxford, as well as several monuments to the Earls of Plymouth who lived at adjacent Hewell Grange. Several members of the earls' families are buried in the cemetery of St Bartholomew's, including Robert George Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth, GBE, CB, PC (1857–1923) and his parents-in-law, Sir Augustus Berkeley Paget, GCB (1823–1896) and Walburga, Lady Paget (1839–1929), the diarist, writer and friend of Queen Victoria.

There is little industry in the village remaining, apart from minor canal narrow boat repairing works. =Fruit and cider= The area become predominately a fruit growing area until the end of the 20th century with the famous Tardebigge orchards supplying produce to the Birmingham conurbation. Most of these orchards were grubbed up in the 1970s and 1980s with the last orchard being removed in 2000, when cheaper imported fruit replaced the home grown produce. The only orchard planted recently is the small orchard of Tardebigge Cider. Tardebigge Cider is a craft cider maker based in Tutnall, about a mile from the church. The cidermaker Steve Cooper planted a mixed orchard of traditional apple varieties of about 100 trees in 1995. The varieties are primarily Dabinett, Michelin, and Harry Masters Jersey with a few culinary varieties included along with some pears, Moorcroft and Worcester Black. The fruit from these trees and other Worcestershire fruit go to make about 1,000-1,500 gallons of high quality cider which is only sold locally.

National and international success In 1969 Wilkie swam representing Britain for the first time in an international swimming contest swimming against the Russian 200-metre breaststroke world record-holder Nikolai Pankin. Wilkie broke the British record for the 200-metre breastroke in an international match against Denmark in July 1970. He then won a bronze medal in front of his home crowd in the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in the 200-metre breaststroke breaking his own British record again. He wore a swim cap for that event during the commonwealth games, making him the first elite swimmer to wear one in a major competition. In 1970 the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association awarded Wilkie the Nancy Riach Memorial Medal Award (awarded to the person who has the done the most to enhance or uphold the prestige of Scottish Swimming during the year) and the W.G. Todd Cup and Prize (Junior Swimmer of the Year). This was the first time in the Association's history that both awards had gone to the same person in the same year. Wilkie continued to hold the Nancy Riach award every year from 1972 to 1976. At the Scottish national long course championships in 1972, Wilkie won five events. However Wilkie's world breakthrough came when he won silver in the 200-metre breaststroke at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, in a European record time of 2:23:67 in spite of being ranked only 25th in the world. He also broke the Scottish record times for the 100-metre breaststroke and the 200-metre individual medley. In 1973 Wilkie was studying and swimming in the United States. He won the World Championship for 200-metre breaststroke in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and broke the world record. At the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, he won a gold in the 200-metre breaststroke, a second gold in the 200-metre individual medley, and a silver in the 100-metre breaststroke. Also in 1974 at the European Championships in Vienna, Austria, he won a gold in the 200-metre individual medley in a world record time.

This makes the set of critical values \\"small\\" in the sense of a generic property. The theorem is named for Anthony Morse and Arthur Sard.  Statement  More explicitly, let :f\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^m be C^k, (that is, k times continuously differentiable), where k\\\\geq \\\\max\\\\\\\\{n-m+1, 1\\\\\\\\}. Let X denote the critical set of f, which is the set of points x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n at which the Jacobian matrix of f has rank . Then the image f(X) has Lebesgue measure 0 in \\\\mathbb{R}^m. Intuitively speaking, this means that although X may be large, its image must be small in the sense of Lebesgue measure: while f may have many critical points in the domain \\\\mathbb{R}^n, it must have few critical values in the image \\\\mathbb{R}^m. More generally, the result also holds for mappings between differentiable manifolds M and N of dimensions m and n, respectively. The critical set X of a C^k function :f:N\\\\rightarrow M consists of those points at which the differential :df:TN\\\\rightarrow TM has rank less than m as a linear transformation. If k\\\\geq \\\\max\\\\\\\\{n-m+1,1\\\\\\\\}, then Sard's theorem asserts that the image of X has measure zero as a subset of M. This formulation of the result follows from the version for Euclidean spaces by taking a countable set of coordinate patches. The conclusion of the theorem is a local statement, since a countable union of sets of measure zero is a set of measure zero, and the property of a subset of a coordinate patch having zero measure is invariant under diffeomorphism.  Variants  There are many variants of this lemma, which plays a basic role in singularity theory among other fields. The case m=1 was proven by Anthony P. Morse in 1939, and the general case by Arthur Sard in 1942. A version for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Stephen Smale. The statement is quite powerful, and the proof involves analysis. In topology it is often quoted — as in the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and some applications in Morse theory — in order to prove the weaker corollary that “a non-constant smooth map has at least one regular value”. In 1965 Sard further generalized his theorem to state that if f:N\\\\rightarrow M is C^k for k\\\\geq \\\\max\\\\\\\\{n-m+1, 1\\\\\\\\} and if A_r\\\\subseteq N is the set of points x\\\\in N such that df_x has rank strictly less than r, then the r-dimensional Hausdorff measure of f(A_r) is zero. and also In particular the Hausdorff dimension of f(A_r) is at most r. Caveat: The Hausdorff dimension of f(A_r) can be arbitrarily close to r.

The Balloon Fiesta is a nine-day event occurring in the first full week of October, and has over 500 hot air balloons each year far from it humble beginnings of merely 13 balloons in 1972. The event is the largest balloon festival in the world, followed by the Grand Est Mondial Air in France.  History  Big Green Cat, 2007 Fiesta Close Encounter, 2007 Fiesta The Balloon Fiesta began in 1972 as the highlight of a 50th birthday celebration for 770 KOB Radio. Radio station manager Dick McKee asked Sid Cutter, owner of Cutter Flying Service and the first person to own a hot air balloon in New Mexico, if KOB could use his new hot-air balloon as part of the festivities. The two began discussing ballooning, along with conversation and help from Oscar Kratz, and McKee asked what the largest gathering of hot air balloons to date had been. 19 balloons in England, Cutter replied. Kratz asked \\"Can we get 19 here?\\" Cutter agreed to try. He got commitments from 21 pilots, but bad weather kept some of them from arriving in time. The first fiesta ended up as a gathering of 13 balloons on April 8, 1972, sponsored by KOB. The first event was located in the parking lot of the Coronado Center Shopping Mall with 20,000 spectators and with balloonists from Arizona, California, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Texas taking part. McKee, Cutter, and Kratz are the three men who had originally started the balloon races.Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, Albuquerque Hot Air Balloon Rides, Albuquerque Balloon F The first fiesta incorporated a \\"Roadrunner- Coyote Balloon Race\\" (a \\"hare-and-hounds\\" race elsewhere in the world) with 1 balloon being the \\"Roadrunner\\" and the others being \\"Coyote\\" balloons (the \\"Roadrunner\\" balloon was actually emblazoned with likenesses of both Warner Bros. characters). The winner of the race - the \\"Coyote\\" that landed closest to the Roadrunner - was Don Piccard of the noted aerostation dynasty, flying a balloon of his company's design and construction (his wife also placed in the race). This race has continued as part of the Balloon Fiesta today. The next year Albuquerque hosted the first World Hot-Air Balloon Championships in February and the fiesta became an international event. In 1975 Albuquerque was looking at hosting the World Championships again, but the event was scheduled for October. So the fiesta was moved to correspond with the championships. To maintain interest in Albuquerque's bid to host the championships, a balloon rally was held in February of that year. Autumn being a far better flying time than February, the event has remained in early October to the present day. The Balloon Fiesta grew each year for decades, and today is the largest balloon convention in the world. The number of registered balloons reached a peak of 1,019 in 2000, prompting the Balloon Fiesta Board to limit the number to 750 starting in 2001, citing a desire for \\"quality over quantity\\". The limit was changed to 600 in 2009 –; citing recent growth in the city and a loss of landing zones. On any given day during the festival, up to 100,000 spectators may be on the launch field where they are provided the rare opportunity to observe inflation and take off procedures. Countless more people gather at landing sites all over the city to watch incoming balloons. It has increased to 1,000 in 2011. The COVID-19 pandemic was the chief cause of 2020's cancellation and deferral to 2021.  Events  The Dawn Patrol lifts off before sunrise to check wind conditions aloft, and hopefully find the Albuquerque box. Mass ascension, 2006 Special Shapes Rodeo, 2008 =Dawn Patrol= The Dawn Patrol began at the Balloon Fiesta in 1978, when two California balloonists developed position lighting systems that allowed them to fly at night. Dawn Patrol pilots take off before sunrise and fly until it is light enough to see landing sites. Fellow balloonists appreciate the Dawn Patrol because they can watch the balloons and get an early idea of wind speeds and directions at different altitudes. =Mass Ascensions= One of the biggest events of the fiesta, where all participating balloons launch in two waves, filling the sky with hundreds of balloons at once. Launch directors, also known as “zebras” because of their black-and-white-striped outfits, serve as “traffic cops,” coordinating the launch so balloons leave the field in a safe and coordinated manner. =Artistic Vision= Many local artists take advantage of the balloons as favorite subject matter for their paintings. Balloons often land in Albuquerque neighborhoods. Many residents watch the balloons from the comfort of their backyards. =Special Shape Rodeo= Many non-traditional, uniquely shaped balloons are launched at the same time. Some of the most famous shapes include a milk cow, a wagon coach, twin bees, and many others like soda pop cans and animals. This is the most popular part of the event as families can see how balloons can be all different in shapes and sizes. =Balloon Glows= Large numbers of balloons are illuminated at night by their propane burners. They stand static and do not take off during these events. The \\"Glowdeo\\" is a night glow for the special shapes balloons. =Special Events and Competitions= Various events like: *The Fiesta Challenge, a game where balloonists attempt to drop a marker closest to a target. *America's Challenge Gas Balloon Race, where special long-distance gas balloons are inflated and then launched. The winner of the race is the balloon that travels the farthest. Some balloons in the race have gone as far as Canada and the U.S. East Coast. *The Flight of the Nations Mass Ascension, where balloonists from each nation launch, one at a time, to their national anthem and waving their nation's flag. *Other piloting, skill, and speed competitions. *Music Fiesta, the fiesta invites artists for concerts and shows. *Rainbow Ryders, the official balloon rides that people can book and enjoy.  Local impact  The convention has also become a major showcase of New Mexican culture and history and features numerous cultural exhibitions. The fiesta is one of Albuquerque's largest tourist attractions and constitutes a major source of income for the city and local businesses. Albuquerque also has the most instate/resident balloonists at over 300 people. In 2015, the fiesta logged 955,703 visitors.https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/blog/morning- edition/2015/11/by-the-numbersballoon-fiesta-saw-big-visitor.html Typically, tourists and fiesta visitors take thousands of pictures of the balloons, so it is no surprise that for several years the fiesta was sponsored by Kodak and was given the title, the Kodak Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, though that title was usually only used in print ads and on official memorabilia. In 2018 the fiesta was presented by Canon, a Japanese camera and imaging company.  Albuquerque box  Diagram of the Albuquerque Box Effect when conditions are optimal The success of the Fiesta depends in part on the cool Albuquerque morning temperatures in October and the Albuquerque box. The \\"box\\" is a set of predictable wind patterns that can be exploited to navigate the balloons. At low elevations the winds tend to be northerly (from the north), but at higher elevations they tend to be southerly. Balloonists use these winds to navigate in a vertical box: they ascend slightly from the launch park, move south, ascend further, move north, descend, and repeat the box or land back in the launch park or quite nearby. During events involving on-field targets, such as the \\"Key Grab\\" (where pilots attempt to grab prizes, including a set of keys to a new vehicle, from atop tall, flexible poles), it's not uncommon to see the same balloon make 5 or 6 passes at the targets, simply by working the \\"Box\\" to keep returning to the field.  Location  Balloon Fiesta Park, from which the balloons are launched, is located on the northern edge of the city. The park is a multi-use field and is home to many other event through out the year. In 2005, the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum was opened on the grounds. The museum is dedicated to the history, science, sport, and art of ballooning and other innovative forms of flight.

Although usually small in comparison to the fundamental benefits of safety interventions, it may result in a lower net benefit than expected. \\"Behavioural adaptation generally does not eliminate the safety gains from programmes, but tends to reduce the size of the expected effects\\" By way of example, it has been observed that motorists drove faster when wearing seatbelts and closer to the vehicle in front when the vehicles were fitted with anti-lock brakes. There is also evidence that the risk compensation phenomenon could explain the failure of condom distribution programs to reverse HIV prevalence and that condoms may foster disinhibition, with people engaging in risky sex both with and without condoms. By contrast, shared space is a highway design method which consciously aims to increase the level of perceived risk and uncertainty, thereby slowing traffic and reducing the number of and seriousness of injuries. Overview Risk compensation is related to the broader term behavioral adaptation which includes all behavior changes in response to safety measures, whether compensatory or not. However, since researchers are primarily interested in the compensatory or negative adaptive behavior the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. \\"A term, closely related to risk compensation, is ‘behavioural adaptation’. Behavioural adaptation is a wider term referring to all behavioural changes triggered by a safety measure (OECD, 1997). Strictly spoken, this includes all positive and negative behavioural changes induced by road safety measures. Nevertheless, the emphasis is primarily put on the negative aspects of this phenomenon.\\" The more recent version emerged from road safety research after it was claimed that many interventions failed to achieve the expected level of benefits but has since been investigated in many other fields. \\"Risk compensation is the term given to a theory which tries to understand the behaviour of people in potentially hazardous activities. In the context of the road user, risk compensation refers to the tendency of road users to compensate for changes in the road system that are perceived as improving safety by adapting behaviour (Elvik and Vaa,2004). So measures, designed to improve traffic safety, may bring along negative consequences in a way that individuals increase the riskiness of their driving behaviour because they feel safer (Dulisse, 1997)\\" \\"The early risk compensation literature deals with road safety... Several recent studies examine risk compensation in response to both aggregate and specific consumer product and workplace safety regulations\\" =Peltzman effect= The reduction of predicted benefit from regulations that intend to increase safety is sometimes referred to as the Peltzman effect in recognition of Sam Peltzman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who published \\"The Effects of Automobile Safety Regulation\\" in the Journal of Political Economy in 1975 in which he controversially suggested that \\"offsets (due to risk compensation) are virtually complete, so that regulation has not decreased highway deaths\\". Peltzman claimed to originate this theory in the 1970s but it was used to oppose the requirement of safety equipment on trains in the Nineteenth Century . A reanalysis of his original data found numerous errors and his model failed to predict fatality rates before regulation . According to Peltzman, regulation was at best useless, at worst counterproductive. \\"This conclusion startled the road safety community and challenged the role of government in attempting to improve safety through regulation. In Peltzman's view, government regulation was useless and perhaps even counterproductive.\\" Peltzman found that the level of risk compensation in response to highway safety regulations was complete in original study. But \\"Peltzman’s theory does not predict the magnitude of risk compensatory behaviour.\\" Substantial further empirical work has found that the effect exists in many contexts but generally offsets less than half of the direct effect. In the U.S., motor vehicle fatalities per population declined by more than half from the beginning of regulation in the 1960s through 2012. Vehicle safety standards accounted for most of the reduction augmented by seat belt use laws, changes in the minimum drinking age, and reductions in teen driving . The Peltzman effect can also result in a redistributing effect where the consequences of risky behaviour are increasingly felt by innocent parties (see moral hazard). By way of example, if a risk-tolerant driver responds to driver-safety interventions, such as compulsory seat belts, crumple zones, ABS etc. by driving faster with less attention, then this can result in increases in injuries and deaths to pedestrians. =Risk homeostasis= Risk homeostasis is a controversial hypothesis, initially proposed in 1982 by Gerald J. S. Wilde, a professor at Queen's University in Canada, which suggests that people maximise their benefit by comparing the expected costs and benefits of safer and riskier behaviour and which introduced the idea of the target level of risk. \\"The level of risk at which the net benefit is expected to maximize is called the target level of risk in recognition of the realization that people do not try to minimize risk (which would be zero at zero mobility), but instead attempt to optimize it\\" He proposed four constituents to a person's calculations relating to risk: \\"Besides macroeconomic influences, there are other factors that influence the level of accepted risk; these are of a cultural, social, or psychological kind. In general, the amount of risk that people are willing (in fact, prefer) to take can be said to depend on four utility factors and will be greater to the extent that factors...\\" * Expected benefits of risky behavior (e.g., gaining time by speeding, fighting boredom, increasing mobility) * Expected costs of risky behavior (e.g., speeding tickets, car repairs, insurance surcharges) * Expected benefits of safe behavior (e.g., insurance discounts for accident-free periods, enhancement of reputation of responsibility) * Expected costs of safe behavior (e.g., using an uncomfortable seat belt, being called a coward by one's peers, time loss) Wilde noted that when Sweden changed from driving on the left to driving on the right in 1967, this was followed by a marked reduction in the traffic fatality rate for 18 months after which the trend returned to its previous values. He suggested that drivers had responded to increased perceived danger by taking more care, only to revert to previous habits as they became accustomed to the new regime. \\"In the fall of 1967 Sweden changed over from left hand to right hand traffic. This was followed by a marked reduction in the traffic fatality rate. About a year and a half later, the accident rate returned to the trend before the changeover.\\" A similar pattern was seen following Iceland's switch from left- to right-hand driving. In a Munich study, part of a fleet of taxicabs were equipped with anti-lock brakes (ABS), while the remainder had conventional brake systems. In other respects, the two types of cars were identical. The crash rates, studied over three years, were a little higher for the cabs with ABS, Wilde concluded that drivers of ABS- equipped cabs took more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them; non- ABS drivers were said to drive more carefully since they could not rely on ABS in a dangerous situation. The idea of risk homeostasis is disputed. One author claimed that it received \\"little support\\", \\"The extreme views of risk homeostasis have attracted little support\\" another suggested that it \\"commands about as much credence as the flat earth hypothesis\\", \\"Risk homeostasis is not a theory. It is a hypothesis that repeatedly has been refuted by empirical studies. As Evans has noted, it commands about as much credence as the flat earth hypothesis\\" a third noted that the proposal did create considerable media attention: \\"What set the debate alight, rather like petrol on flames, was the proposition in 1982 that road users did not just adapt to perceptions of changing risk through compensatory behaviors, but that the process was a homeostatic one, producing overall equilibrium in safety-related outcomes\\"., 'Early Theories of Behavioural Adaptations' by Oliver Carsten: \\"What set the debate alight, rather like petrol on flames, was the proposition in 1982 that road users did not just adapt to perceptions of changing risk through compensatory behaviors, but that the process was a homeostatic one, producing overall equilibrium in safety-related outcomes\\" Others claimed that road fatality statistics, which have fallen considerably since the introduction of safety measures, do not support the theory. Examples =Road transport= Anti-lock brakes Anti-lock braking systems are designed to increase vehicle safety by allowing the vehicle to steer whilst braking A number of studies show that drivers of vehicles with ABS tend to drive faster, follow closer and brake later, accounting for the failure of ABS to result in any measurable improvement in road safety. The studies were performed in Canada, Denmark, and Germany.Grant and Smiley, \\"Driver response to antilock brakes: a demonstration of behavioural adaptation\\" from Proceedings, Canadian Multidisciplinary Road Safety Conference VIII, June 14–16, Saskatchewan 1993.Aschenbrenner and Biehl, \\"Improved safety through improved technical measures? empirical studies regarding risk compensation processes in relation to anti-lock braking systems\\". In Trimpop and Wilde, Challenges to Accident Prevention: The issue of risk compensation behaviour (Groningen, NL, Styx Publications, 1994). A study led by Fred Mannering, a professor of civil engineering at the University of South Florida supports risk compensation, terming it the \\"offset hypothesis\\". A study of crashes involving taxicabs in Munich of which half had been equipped with anti-lock brakes noted that crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and concluded this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks. However, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released a study in 2010 that found motorcycles with ABS 37% less likely to be involved in a fatal crash than models without ABS. A 2004 study found that ABS reduced the risk of multiple vehicle crashes by 18 percent, but had increased the risk of run-off-road crashes by 35 percent. Seat belts A 1994 research study of people who both wore and habitually did not wear seatbelts concluded that drivers were found to drive faster and less carefully when belted. Several important driving behaviors were observed on the road before and after the belt use law was enforced in Newfoundland, and in Nova Scotia during the same period without a law. Belt use increased from 16 percent to 77 percent in Newfoundland and remained virtually unchanged in Nova Scotia. Four driver behaviors (speed, stopping at intersections when the control light was amber, turning left in front of oncoming traffic, and gaps in following distance) were measured at various sites before and after the law. Changes in these behaviors in Newfoundland were similar to those in Nova Scotia, except that drivers in Newfoundland drove slower on expressways after the law, contrary to the risk compensation theory . In Britain in 1981 at a time when the government was considering the introduction of seat belt legislation, John Adams of University College London, suggested that there was no convincing evidence of a correlation between the seat-belt legislation and reductions injuries and fatalities based on a comparison between states with and without seat belt laws. He also suggested that some injuries were displaced from car drivers to pedestrians and other road users. The \\"Isles Report\\" echoed these concerns. Adams subsequently argued that the reduction in fatalities that followed the introduction of legislation could not be attributed with confidence to seat- belt use due to the simultaneous introduction of breath testing for driving under the influence of alcohol. However, a 2007 study based on data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that between 1985 and 2002 there were \\"significant reductions in fatality rates for occupants and motorcyclists after the implementation of belt use laws\\", and that \\"seatbelt use rate is significantly related to lower fatality rates for the total, pedestrian, and all non-occupant models even when controlling for the presence of other state traffic safety policies and a variety of demographic factors\\". A comprehensive 2003 US study also did \\"not find any evidence that higher seat belt usage has a significant effect on driving behavior.\\" Their results showed that \\"overall, mandatory seat belt laws unambiguously reduce traffic fatalities.\\" Swedish change to driving on the right In Sweden, following the change from driving on the left to driving on the right in 1967 there was a drop in crashes and fatalities, which was linked to the increased apparent risk. The number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%, returning to normal over the next six weeks. Fatality levels took two years to return to normal.\\"On September 4 there were 125 reported traffic accidents as opposed to 130-196 from the previous Mondays. No traffic fatalities were linked to the switch. In fact, fatalities dropped for two years, possibly because drivers were more vigilant after the switch.\\" Sweden finally began driving on the right side of the road in 1967 The Examiner Sept 2, 2009 \\"An example of risk overestimation in the short run is offered by the experience in Sweden when that country changed from left- to right-hand driving in the fall of 1967. This intervention led to a marked surge in perceived risk that exceeded the target level and thus was followed by a very cautious behavior that caused a major decrease in road fatalities. ...the accident rate returned to 'normal' within 2 years.\\" Speed limits The control of traffic speeds using effectively enforced speed limits and other traffic calming methods plays an important role in the reduction of road traffic casualties; speed limit changes alone without accompanying enforcement or traffic calming measures will not. A 1994 study conducted to test the risk homeostasis theory, using a driving simulator, found that increasing posted speed limits and a reduction of speeding fines had significantly increased driving speed but resulted in no change in the accident frequency. It also showed that increased accident cost caused large and significant reductions in accident frequency but no change in speed choice. The results suggest that regulation of specific risky behaviors such as speed choice may have little influence on accident rates. Shared space Shared space is an approach to the design of roads, where risk compensation is consciously used to increase the level of uncertainty for drivers and other road users by removing traditional demarcations between vehicle traffic by removing curbs, road surface markings, and traffic signs. The approach has been found to result in lower vehicle speeds and fewer road casualties. Bicycle helmets Campaigns and legislation to encourage the wearing of cycle helmets have not been shown to reduce significant head injuries, and \\"there is evidence to suggest that some cyclists ride less cautiously when helmeted because they feel more protected\\". In one experimental study, adults accustomed to wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but no difference in helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets. A Spanish study of traffic accidents between 1990 and 1999 found no strong evidence of risk compensation in helmet wearers but concluded that \\"this possibility cannot be ruled out\\". Motorists may also alter their behavior toward helmeted cyclists. One study by Walker in England found that 2,500 vehicles passed a helmeted cyclist with measurably less clearance (8.5 cm) than that given to the same cyclist unhelmeted (out of an average total passing distance of 1.2 to 1.3 metres). The significance of these differences has been re-analysed by Olivier, who argued that the effect on safety was not significant since the passing distances were over 1 metre, and again by Walker, who disagreed with Olivier's conclusion. In 1988, Rodgers re-analysed data which supposedly showed helmets to be effective and found both data errors and methodological weaknesses. He concluded that in fact the data showed \\"bicycle-related fatalities are positively and significantly associated with increased helmet use\\" and mentioned risk compensation as one possible explanation of this association. =Sport= Ski helmets Recent studies indicate that skiers wearing helmets go faster on average than non-helmeted skiers, and that overall risk index is higher in helmeted skiers than non-helmeted skiers. Moreover, while helmets may help prevent minor head injuries, increased usage of helmets has not reduced the overall fatality rate. Other recent studies have concluded that helmet use is not associated with riskier behavior among skiers and snowboarders, and that helmet usage reduces the risk and severity of head injuries. \\"Helmet use is not associated with riskier behaviour on slopes. In addition, helmet use has to be recommended because helmet use reduces the risk of head injuries among skiers and snowboarders\\" \\"Safety helmets clearly decrease the risk and severity of head injuries in skiing and snowboarding and do not seem to increase the risk of neck injury, cervical spine injury, or risk compensation behavior\\" Football helmets Some researchers have found the counterintuitive result that wearing helmets in gridiron football actually increases the chance of injury, and thus they recommend players occasionally practice without helmets. When hard shells were first introduced, the number of head injuries increased because players had a false sense of security and made more dangerous tackles. Skydiving 'Booth's rule #2', often attributed to skydiving pioneer Bill Booth, states, \\"the safer skydiving gear becomes, the more chances skydivers will take, in order to keep the fatality rate constant\\". Even though skydiving equipment has made huge leaps forward in terms of reliability, including the introduction of safety devices such as AADs, the fatality rate has stayed roughly constant when adjusted for the increasing number of participants. This can largely be attributed to an increase in the popularity of high performance canopies, which fly much faster than traditional parachutes. A greater number of landing fatalities in recent years has been attributed to high speed maneuvers close to the ground. =Safety equipment in children= Experimental studies have suggested that children who wear protective equipment are likely to take more risks. =Health= Risky sexual behavior and HIV/AIDS Evidence on risk compensation associated with HIV prevention interventions is mixed. Harvard researcher Edward C. Green argued that the risk compensation phenomenon could explain the failure of condom distribution programs to reverse HIV prevalence, providing a detailed explanations of his views in an op-ed article for The Washington Post and an extended interview with the BBC. A 2007 article in the Lancet suggested that \\"condoms seem to foster disinhibition, in which people engage in risky sex either with condoms or with the intention of using condoms\\". Another report compared risk behaviour of men based on whether they were circumcised. A 2015 study showed that adolescents with safe-sex beliefs (adolescents who believe that sex with condoms is 100% safe) have an earlier sexual initiation.  PrEP  While pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with anti-HIV drugs appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks; specifically, reduced use of condoms in anal sex, raising risks of spreading sexually transmitted diseases other than HIV.

She became the first Australian woman to compete at five Olympic Games. Early life Cook was born in Townsville, Queensland. She was the dux of her school, Corinda State High (located in the western suburbs of Brisbane). She enrolled in pre-medicine college courses, and also took up volleyball, captaining the Australian Indoor Junior Team in 1992. In 1993 she began playing beach volleyball. In 1994 she went professional and gave up her pursuit of a medical degree. Career Cook (in yellow) in the 2008 Summer Olympics quarterfinals vs Brazil. Cook partnered with Kerri Pottharst to represent Australia at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, winning a bronze medal—the first time that beach volleyball had been an Olympic sport. In the same year, the pair won a silver medal at the world championships, and came first in the World Tour Event in Japan. Cook and Pottharst did not play together again until 2000. They finished third in the World Tour Events, held in France and Portugal, and then participated in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. They dominated the competition, winning the gold medal. In the aftermath of their Olympic win, the pair were awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Cook and Pottharst were included in the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball's Team of the Decade. After the Olympics, Pottharst retired, and Cook found a new partner in Nicole Sanderson. They won a bronze medal at the 2003 Beach Volleyball World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, and by the end of the 2003 world tour, were ranked fourth in the world. They were subsequently selected to represent Australia at the 2004 Athens Olympics. After a promising start, they finished out of medal contention, losing to teams from Brazil and the United States. For the 2008 Summer Olympics, Cook partnered with Tamsin Barnett, finishing fifth overall. On 1 August 2012, Cook's record breaking beach volleyball career came to an end with her elimination from her fifth games in London. Personal life Cook currently resides in Brisbane and is married to fellow beach volleyballer Sarah Maxwell. In addition to her sporting career, Cook tours on the public speaking circuit as a leading motivational speaker attracting big audiences and has launched her own beach volleyball-related business, Sandstorm.

In 1820, while at sea in the southern Pacific Ocean under the command of Captain George Pollard Jr., she was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale. Stranded thousands of miles from the coast of South America with little food and water, the 20-man crew was forced to make for land in the ship's surviving whaleboats. The men suffered severe dehydration, starvation, and exposure on the open ocean, and the survivors eventually resorted to eating the bodies of the crewmen who had died. When that proved insufficient, members of the crew drew lots to determine whom they would sacrifice so that the others could live. A total of seven crew members were cannibalized before the last of the eight survivors were rescued, more than three months after the sinking of the Essex. First mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson later wrote accounts of the ordeal. The tragedy attracted international attention, and inspired Herman Melville to write his famous 1851 novel Moby- Dick. Ship and crew By the time of her fateful voyage, Essex was already an old ship, but because so many of her previous voyages had been profitable, she had gained a reputation as a \\"lucky\\" vessel. Captain George Pollard Jr. and first mate Owen Chase had served together on the ship's previous trip, which had been highly successful and led to their promotions. In 1819, at the age of 29, Pollard was one of the youngest men ever to command a whaling ship; Chase was 23, and the youngest member of the crew was the cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, who was 14. Essex had recently been totally refitted, but at only in length, and measuring about 239 tons burthen,, citing original 1799 specifications. she was small for a whaleship. Essex was equipped with four whaleboats, each about in length. In addition, she had a spare whaleboat below decks. These boats were clinker built, with planks that overlapped each other rather than fitting flush together. Final voyage Essex departed from Nantucket on August 12, 1819, on what was expected to be a roughly two-and-a- half-year voyage to the bountiful whaling grounds off the west coast of South America. The crew numbered 21 men in total. Two days after her departure from Nantucket, Essex was hit by a sudden squall in the Gulf Stream. She was knocked on her beam-ends and nearly sank. She lost her topgallant sail and two whaleboats were destroyed, with an additional whaleboat damaged. Captain Pollard elected to continue the voyage without replacing the two boats or repairing the damage. Essex rounded Cape Horn in January 1820 after a transit of five weeks, which was extremely slow. With this and the unsettling earlier incident, the crew began to talk of ill omens. Their spirits were temporarily lifted when Essex began the long spring and summer hunt in the warm waters of the South Pacific Ocean, traveling north along the western coast of South America up to the Spanish-ruled Royal Audience of Quito (present-day Ecuador). =Whaling grounds depleted= The crew was divided into three groups of six, each of which manned one of the three usable whaleboats whenever whales were sighted; the remaining three men stayed aboard to manage the Essex. Each whaleboat was led by one of the three officers – Pollard, Chase, and Joy – each of whom then chose his five other crew members. In September 1820, a sailor named Henry DeWitt deserted at Atacames, reducing the crew of the Essex to 20 men. While sailors fled whaling ships all the time, the desertion was bad news for Captain Pollard because each of the ship's three whaleboats required a crew of six. This meant only two men would remain to keep the Essex while a whale-hunt was in progress, which was not sufficient to safely handle a ship of Essexs size and type. After finding the area's population of whales exhausted, the crew encountered other whalers who told them of a vast newly discovered hunting ground, known as the \\"offshore ground\\", located between 5 and 10 degrees south latitude and between 105 and 125 degrees west longitude, about to the south and west. This was an immense distance from known shores for the whalers, and the crew had heard rumors that cannibals populated the many islands of the South Pacific. =Repairs and resupply at Galápagos= To restock their food supplies for the long journey, Essex sailed for Charles Island (later renamed Floreana Island) in the Galápagos Islands. The crew needed to fix a serious leak and initially anchored off Hood Island (now known as Española Island) on October 8, 1820. During a week at anchor, they captured 300 Galápagos giant tortoises to supplement the ship's food stores. They then sailed for Charles Island, where on October 22 they took another 60 tortoises. The tortoises weighed between each. The sailors captured them alive and allowed some of them to roam the ship at will; the rest they kept in the hold. They believed the tortoises were capable of living for a year without eating or drinking water (though in fact the tortoises slowly starved). The sailors considered the tortoises delicious and extremely nutritious, and planned to butcher them at sea as needed. While hunting on Charles Island, helmsman Thomas Chapple decided to set a fire as a prank. It was the height of the dry season, and the fire quickly burned out of control, surrounding the hunters and forcing them to run through the flames to escape. By the time the men returned to Essex, almost the entire island was burning. The crew was upset about the fire, and Captain Pollard swore vengeance on whoever had set it. The next day, the island was still burning as the ship sailed for the offshore grounds. After a full day of sailing, the fire was still visible on the horizon. Fearing a certain whipping, Chapple only later admitted that he had set the fire. Many years later, Nickerson returned to Charles Island and found a blackened wasteland; he observed \\"neither trees, shrubbery, nor grass have since appeared\\". It has been suggested that the fire contributed to the near- extinctionhttps://www.galapagos.org/newsroom/floreana-tortoise-species- resurrection/ of the Floreana Island tortoise and the Floreana mockingbird, which no longer inhabit the island. =Offshore ground= When Essex finally reached the promised fishing grounds thousands of miles west of the coast of South America, the crew was unable to find any whales for days. Tension mounted among the officers of Essex, especially between Pollard and Chase. When they finally found a whale on November 16, it surfaced directly beneath Chase's boat, with the result that the boat was \\"dashed ... literally in pieces\\". At eight in the morning of November 20, 1820, the lookout sighted spouts, and the three remaining whaleboats set out to pursue a pod of sperm whales. On the leeward side of Essex, Chase's whaleboat harpooned a whale, but its tail struck the boat and opened up a seam, forcing the crew to cut the harpoon line and return to Essex for repairs. Two miles away off the windward side, Pollard's and Joy's boats each harpooned a whale and were dragged towards the horizon away from the Essex in what whalers called a \\"Nantucket sleighride\\". =Whale attack= Chase was repairing the damaged whaleboat on board the Essex when the crew sighted an abnormally large sperm whale bull (reportedly around in length) acting strangely. It lay motionless on the surface facing the ship and then began to swim towards the vessel, picking up speed by shallow diving. The whale rammed Essex, rocking her from side to side, and then dived under her, surfacing close on the ship's starboard side. As its head lay alongside the bow and the tail by the stern, it was motionless and appeared to be stunned. Chase prepared to harpoon it from the deck when he realized that its tail was only inches from the rudder, which the whale could easily destroy if provoked by an attempt to kill it. Fearing to leave the ship stuck thousands of miles from land with no way to steer it, Chase hesitated. The whale recovered, swam several hundred yards forward of the ship, and turned to face the ship's bow. The whale crushed the bow, driving the vessel backwards, and then finally disengaged its head from the shattered timbers and swam off, never to be seen again, leaving Essex quickly going down by the bow. Chase and the remaining sailors frantically tried to add rigging to the only remaining whaleboat, while the steward William Bond ran below to gather the captain's sea chest and whatever navigational aids he could find. The cause of the whale's aggression is not known. In In the Heart of the Sea, author Nathaniel Philbrick speculated that it may have first struck the boat accidentally, or have had its curiosity aroused by the sound of a hammer as a whaler worked to repair a damaged whaleboat by nailing in a replacement board. The frequency and sound of the nailing may have sounded similar to those made by bull sperm whales to communicate and echolocate. Survivors Map showing the location of Essex sinking marked by an X and the area traveled Essex was attacked approximately west of South America. After spending two days salvaging what supplies they could from the waterlogged wreck, the 20 sailors prepared to set out in the three small whaleboats, aware that they had wholly inadequate supplies of food and fresh water for a journey to land. The boats were rigged with makeshift masts and sails taken from the Essex, and boards were added to heighten the gunwales and prevent large waves from spilling over the sides. Inside Pollard's sea chest, which Bond's quick thinking had managed to save, were two sets of navigational equipment and two copies of maritime charts. These were split between Pollard's and Chase's boats; Joy's boat was left without any means of navigating except to keep within sight of the other boats. Examining the charts, the officers deduced that the closest known islands, the Marquesas, were more than to the west, and Captain Pollard intended to make for them, but the crew, led by Chase, voiced their fears that the islands might be inhabited by cannibals and voted to sail east instead, for South America. Unable to sail against the trade winds, the boats would first need to sail south for before they could take advantage of the Westerlies to turn towards South America, which then would still lie another to the east. Even with the knowledge that this route would require them to travel twice as far as the route to the Marquesas, Pollard acceded to the crew's decision and the boats set their course due south. Food and water were rationed from the beginning, but most of the food had been soaked in seawater. The men ate this food first despite it increasing their thirst. It took them around two weeks to consume the contaminated food, and by this time the survivors were rinsing their mouths with seawater and drinking their own urine. Several of the giant tortoises captured from the Galápagos were brought aboard the whaleboats as well, but their size prevented the crew from bringing all of them. Never designed for long voyages, all the whaleboats had been very roughly repaired, and leaks were a constant and serious problem during the voyage. After losing a timber, the crew of one boat had to lean to one side to raise the other side out of the water until another boat was able to draw close, allowing a sailor to nail a piece of wood over the hole. Storms and rough seas frequently plagued the tiny whaleboats, and the men who were not occupied with steering and trimming the sails spent most of their time bailing water from the bilge. =Landfall= On December 20, exactly one month after the whale attack, and within hours of the crew beginning to die of thirst, the boats landed on uninhabited Henderson Island, a small uplifted coral atoll within the modern-day British territory of the Pitcairn Islands. The men incorrectly believed that they had landed on Ducie Island, a similar atoll to the east. Had they landed on Pitcairn Island itself, to the southwest, they might have received help; the descendants of the survivors of HMS Bounty, who had famously mutinied in 1789, still lived there. On Henderson Island, Essexs crew found a small freshwater spring below the tideline and the starving men gorged themselves on endemic birds, crabs, eggs, and peppergrass. After just one week, they had largely exhausted the island's food resources. On 26 December, they concluded they would starve if they remained much longer. As most of the crew prepared to set sail in the whaleboats once again, three men – William Wright, Seth Weeks, and Thomas Chapple, the only white members of the crew who were not natives of Nantucket – opted to stay behind on Henderson. Almost a year after Essex sank, Lloyd's List reported that Surry had rescued the three men and taken them to Port Jackson, Australia. =Separation= The remaining Essex crewmen, now numbering 17 in three boats, resumed the journey on December 27 with the intention of reaching Easter Island. Within three days they had exhausted the crabs and birds they had stockpiled from Henderson in preparation for the voyage, leaving only a small reserve of the bread previously salvaged from Essex. On January 4, 1821, they estimated that they had drifted too far south of Easter Island to reach it and decided to make for Más a Tierra island instead, to the east and west of South America. One by one, the men began to die. Second mate Matthew Joy, whose health had been poor even before the Essex left Nantucket, was dying; as his condition steadily worsened, Joy asked if he could rest on Pollard's boat until his death. Joy became the first crew member to die on January 10, and Nantucketer Obed Hendricks assumed the leadership of the boat. The following day, Chase's whaleboat, which also carried Richard Peterson, Isaac Cole, Benjamin Lawrence, and Thomas Nickerson, became separated from the others during a squall. Peterson died on January 18 and, like Joy, was sewn into his clothes and buried at sea, as was the custom. On February 8 Cole died, but with food running out the survivors kept his body, and after a discussion, the men resorted to cannibalism. Obed Hendricks' boat, carrying crew members William Bond and Joseph West, exhausted its food supplies on January 14, and Pollard generously offered to share his own boat's remaining provisions. Pollard's boat carried Lawson Thomas, Charles Shorter, Isaiah Sheppard, Samuel Reed, Owen Coffin, Barzillai Ray, and Charles Ramsdell. They ran out of food on January 21. Thomas died on January 20, and the others decided they had no choice but to keep the body for food. Shorter died on January 23, Sheppard on January 27, and Reed on January 28. Later that day, the two boats separated; Hendricks' boat was never seen again. All three men are presumed to have died at sea. A whaleboat was later found washed up on Ducie Island with the skeletons of three people inside. Although it was suspected to be Obed Hendricks' missing boat, and the remains those of Hendricks, Bond, and West, the remains have never been positively identified. By February 1, the food on Pollard's boat was again exhausted and the survivors' situation became dire. The men drew lots to determine who would be sacrificed for the survival of the remainder. A young man named Owen Coffin, Captain Pollard's 17-year-old first cousin, whom he had sworn to protect, drew the black spot. Pollard allegedly offered to protect his cousin, but Coffin is said to have replied: \\"No, I like my lot as well as any other\\". Lots were drawn again to determine who would be Coffin's executioner. His young friend, Charles Ramsdell, drew the black spot. Ramsdell shot Coffin; Ramsdell, Pollard, and Barzillai Ray consumed the body. On February 11, Ray also died. For the remainder of their journey, Pollard and Ramsdell survived by gnawing on Coffin's and Ray's bones. Rescue and reunion By February 15, the three survivors of Chase's whaleboat had again run out of food. On February 18 – 89 days after Essex sank – the British vessel spotted and rescued Chase, Lawrence, and Nickerson.\\"SOUTH AMERICA\\". Glasgow Herald (Glasgow, Scotland), 6 August1821; Issue 1943. Several days after the rescue, the empty whaleboat was lost in a storm while under tow behind the Indian. Pollard's boat, now containing only Pollard and Ramsdell, was rescued when almost within sight of the South American coast by the Nantucket whaleship Dauphin, 93 days after Essex sank, on February 23\\\\. Pollard and Ramsdell by that time were so completely dissociative that they did not even notice the Dauphin alongside them, and became terrified when they saw their rescuers. On March 5, Dauphin encountered , which was sailing to Valparaíso, and transferred the two men to her. After a few days in Valparaíso, Chase, Lawrence, and Nickerson were transferred to the frigate and placed under the care of the ship's doctor, who oversaw their recovery. After officials were informed that three Essex survivors – Wright, Weeks, and Chapple – had been left behind on Ducie Island (actually Henderson Island), the authorities asked the merchant vessel Surry, which already intended to sail across the Pacific, to look for the men. The rescue succeeded. On March 17, Pollard and Ramsdell were reunited with Chase, Lawrence, and Nickerson. By the time the last of the eight survivors were rescued on April 5, 1821, the corpses of seven fellow sailors had been consumed. All eight went to sea again within months of their return to Nantucket. Herman Melville later speculated that all would have survived had they followed Captain Pollard's recommendation and sailed to Tahiti. Aftermath Owen Chase in later life Thomas Nickerson in the 1870s Pollard returned to sea in early 1822 to captain the whaleship Two Brothers. It was wrecked on the French Frigate Shoals during a storm off the coast of Hawaii on his first voyage, after which he joined a merchant vessel, which was wrecked off the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) shortly thereafter. By now Pollard was considered a \\"Jonah\\" (unlucky), and no ship owner would trust him to sail on a ship again, so he was forced to retire. He subsequently became Nantucket's night watchman. Every November 20, he would reportedly lock himself in his room and fast in memory of the men of Essex. He died in Nantucket on January 7, 1870, aged 78. First Mate Owen Chase returned to Nantucket on June 11, 1821, to find he had a 14-month-old daughter he had never met. Four months later he had completed an account of the disaster, the Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex; Herman Melville used it as one of the inspirations for his novel Moby-Dick (1851). In December, Chase sailed as first mate on the whaler Florida, and then as captain of Winslow for each subsequent voyage, until he could afford to build his own whaler, Charles Carrol. Chase remained at sea for 19 years, only returning home for short periods every two or three years, each time fathering a child. His first two wives died while he was at sea. He divorced his third wife when he found she had given birth 16 months after he had last seen her, although he subsequently brought up the child as his own. In September 1840, two months after the divorce was finalized, he married for the fourth and final time and retired from whaling. Memories of the harrowing ordeal on the Essex haunted Chase, and he suffered terrible headaches and nightmares. Later in his life, he began hiding food in the attic of his Nantucket house on Orange Street and was eventually institutionalized. He died in Nantucket on March 7, 1869, aged 73. The cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, became a captain in the Merchant Service and late in his life wrote his own account of the sinking, titled The Loss of the Ship \\"Essex\\" Sunk by a Whale and the Ordeal of the Crew in Open Boats. Nickerson wrote this account 56 years after the sinking, in 1876, and it was lost until 1960; the Nantucket Historical Association published it in 1984. He died in February 1883, aged 77. The other surviving crew members met various fates: *Thomas Chapple died of plague fever in Timor, while working as a missionary. *William Wright was lost in a hurricane in the West Indies. *Charles Ramsdell died in Nantucket on July 8, 1866, aged 62. *Benjamin Lawrence died in Nantucket on March 28, 1879, aged 80. *Seth Weeks died in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, on September 12, 1887, the last of the Essex survivors to die. Cultural works As well as inspiring much of American author Herman Melville's classic 1851 novel Moby-Dick, the story of the Essex tragedy has been dramatized and memorialized in numerous works of film, television, and music: *The dramatized documentary Revenge of the Whale (2001), was produced and broadcast on September 7, 2001, by NBC. *Composer Deirdre Gribbin's 2004 string quartet What the Whaleship Saw was inspired by the event.What the Whaleship Saw, West Cork Music Archive, 2012. *The television movie The Whale (2013) was broadcast on BBC One on December 22, wherein an elderly Thomas Nickerson (played by Martin Sheen) recounted the events of Essex. Charles Furness played the younger Nickerson, Jonas Armstrong played Owen Chase, and Adam Rayner played Captain Pollard. *The 2015 film In The Heart of the Sea, directed by Ron Howard, was based on Philbrick's book. Chris Hemsworth starred as Owen Chase and Benjamin Walker as Captain Pollard. Brendan Gleeson and Tom Holland portrayed the elder and younger Nickerson, respectively. *Songwriter Rusty Cage has a song named \\"The Final Voyage of the Wailer's Essex\\" that is based on the event. *Hard rock band Scissorfight included a song about the sinking of the Essex titled \\"Stove By A Whale\\" on their 1998 album Balls Deep. *Jamrachs Menagerie, a 2011 novel by Carol Birch, describes an ordeal in its middle section largely based on the shipwreck of The Essex. Other ships attacked by whales The Essex is not the only ship known to have been attacked by a whale: *In 1807, a whale attacked and sank Union. *In 1835, Pusie Hall was attacked. *In 1836, whales attacked Lydia and Two Generals. *In 1850, a whale sank Pocahontas. *On August 20, 1851, a whale sank Ann Alexander. *In 1852, a whale sank Crusader. *In 1855, a whale sank Waterloo. *On June 15, 1972, a pod of killer whales sank the schooner Lucette. *On July 7, 1999, a humpback whale sank the , 111-year- old Herreshoff-designed Merlin in Whale Bay, Baranof Island, Alaska.

It is the first of the Cinque Terre one meets when travelling north from La Spezia. Riomaggiore, the first village of the Cinque Terre The village, dating from the early thirteenth century, is known for its historic character and its wine, produced by the town's vineyards. Riomaggiore is in the Riviera di Levante region and has a shoreline on the Mediterranean's Gulf of Genoa, with a small beach and a wharf framed by tower houses. Riomaggiore's main street is Via Colombo, where numerous restaurants, bars, and shops can be found. The Via dell'Amore is a path connecting Riomaggiore to its frazione Manarola, also part of the Cinque Terre. Riomaggiore is the most southern village of the five Cinque Terre, all connected by trail. The water and mountainside have been declared national parks. Riomaggiore inspired paintings by Telemaco Signorini (1835-1901), one of the artists of the Macchiaioli group.  Transportation  Riomaggiore railway station is on the Genoa–Pisa railway. Its is served by trains run by Trenitalia, including services from . Inside Riomaggiore, all major attractions are walkable for tourists. In popular culture Riomaggiore was featured in the 2014 driving video game Forza Horizon 2.

Elected as a member of the National Party, he resigned from the Nationals and joined the Liberal Party of Australia in February 2006. His brother, Peter McGauran, was the National member for Gippsland until 2008, and was Minister for Agriculture in the Howard government. Background and early career McGauran attended Xavier College in Kew, Melbourne. Before attending university he worked in the stables for racehorse trainer Bart Cummings at Flemington Racecourse. At Monash University he obtained a Bachelor of Economics, then becoming a Certified Practising Accountant and then a company director for the McGauran Group of Companies, and a board member of the Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry between 1986 and 1988. He was elected to the Melbourne City Council 1985–88, representing the Central Business District. During his time at the Council McGauran called for the popular vote of the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, instead of the traditional means of selection by fellow councillor, in an attempt to curtail the \\"invariable cronyism\\" of the Melbourne City Council at the time.Herald, 25 June 1986 Political career =National Party= McGauran won National Party preselection for a Senate seat in the 1987 double-dissolution election, and was subsequently elected. Following the announcement of the election results other senators negotiated, against McGauran's objections, to allocate him a three-year rather than a six- year Senate term. In 1990 due to the circumstances of an historic agreement forming a Coalition Senate ticket he was required to step out of Parliament for three years. In 1993 he was re-elected to the Senate on the Coalition Senate ticket. On 2 November 1989 McGauran introduced the End of War List (Private Members Bill) into the Senate. The Bill was passed unanimously in the Senate, and was aimed at recognising the \\"unsung heroes\\" of the Vietnam War. Although it was unsuccessful in the House of Representatives at the time, in 1999 the Howard Government did establish the War List and more than 80 Vietnam Vets have been honoured for their acts of bravery since this time. McGauran was a strong advocate for the freedom of East Timor. He campaigned from 1993 through to 1999 for the East Timor cause against the then-policy of the major parties.McGauran delivers final Senate speech, Crikey, 22 June 2011 Diagnosed with malaria following a trek along the Kokoda Trail, McGauran ignored doctor's orders and flew to Canberra to speak on the controversial Euthanasia Laws 1996 Bill – supporting the Bill to overturn Northern Territory legislation legalising euthanasia.Senate Hansard, 20 March 1997 11:22pm Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, Second Reading The debate saw the bill narrowly passed in the Senate. The following day he collapsed in his Melbourne office and spent the next week recovering in hospital.The Daily Telegraph, 27 March 1997 p. 21 In November 2000 McGauran called for an inquiry into an incident at the Royal Women's Hospital where an abortion was performed on a 32-week-old fetus. He argued a possible breach of the Victorian Crimes Act which creates an offence of child destruction after 28 weeks gestation had occurred. After years of public debate and argument, the issue was investigated by the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria. In 2001 McGauran became the first Federal MP to join the Australian Army as part of the Federal Government's MP exchange program. He Joined 2RAR on exercise at Jimma training base in Queensland.Sunday Herald Sun, 8 July 2001 McGauran documented his experience in a diary later published.The Sunday Herald Sun, 15 July 2001, pp. 12–13 Before the 2004 election, McGauran faced a pre-selection challenge from three party members, including a former staffer to Trade Minister Mark Vaile. McGauran retained National Party pre-selection after media reports suggested the federal coalition agreement would be endangered if he lost, and thus gained the guaranteed second position on the joint Liberal-National ticket and was re-elected. On 11 August, after the Liberal-National Coalition narrowly won a vote in the Senate, he gave the finger to Labor Party senators on the floor of the Senate in response to comments. This prompted calls from Labor senators and Greens Senator Bob Brown that he be sacked as Deputy Government Whip in the Senate. Senate President Paul Calvert ruled that the gesture was \\"unseemly but not obscene.\\"] In 2004 the McGauran family bankrolled the Democratic Labor Party's High Court challenge against the Australian Electoral Commission which was forcing the political party under threat of deregistration to disclose party membership details. Although the legal challenge was unsuccessful, the DLP survived, largely due to the support of Julian McGauran, who commented, \\"We had a serious interest in the outcome of the case, and our heart was with the DLP. I wouldn’t want to see them fade away\\". McGauran's links to the DLP stem from his first Senate election win in 1987 when DLP preferences were critical in his narrow win over former Communist John Halfpenny. In 2005 McGauran was accused of releasing to The Age newspaper the private patient records of a woman who had had an abortion, in breach of a Supreme Court suppression order; however, he denies this accusation. The then Victoria Health Minister, Bronwyn Pike, is quoted in the article as saying that McGauran was \\"exploiting this woman in pursuit of his own ideological agenda\\", describing the act as an assault on the doctor- patient relationship. =Liberal Party= On 23 January 2006 McGauran announced that he was resigning from the National Party and would apply to join the Liberal Party. He said there was no longer any significant policy difference between the Nationals and Liberals in Victoria at a federal level, and that he would be best able to represent rural Victorians as a member of the Liberal Party. His application was accepted by the Liberals on 3 February. Rumours abounded that Liberal deputy leader and Treasurer Peter Costello, himself a Victorian, lobbied McGauran to switch parties. However, Costello and Howard denied this. Nonetheless, federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile condemned McGauran's defection as a betrayal while state Nationals leader Peter Ryan claimed that McGauran would be \\"treated and reviled\\" as a deserter \\"for the rest of his days.\\" One of the few Liberals who didn't welcome McGauran to the party was former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who called it \\"a gross act of disloyalty.\\"PM denies Liberals poached McGauran The Age, 24 January 2006 McGauran's defection highlighted the historically strained relationship between the non-Labor parties in Victoria. The Liberals and Nationals sat separately for most of the second half of the 20th century; while they governed as a Coalition under Kennett, they had gone their separate ways after their shock defeat in 2002. In 2009 McGauran was the first to speak up against the Liberal policy supporting the Government's Emissions Trading Scheme. He said he would not vote for the scheme in any form, in defiance of the then- Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull. In April 2010 McGauran, a long time campaigner on censorship issues, called for the sacking of the Australian Classification Board Chairman for the Board's release of the formerly banned film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom by Pier Paolo Pasolini. McGauran described the movie as \\"a paedophile's treat\\" and a \\"handbook for deviants\\".Michael Harvey, Herald Sun 17 April 2010 In the 2010 election, McGauran lost his Senate seat to the DLP. His term in the Senate expired 30 June 2011.ABC News Online Senate result confirms Fielding's defeat. Retrieved 11 May 2011. On 12 May 2011 The Age newspaper reported that \\"Senator Julian McGauran has accused Professor Graham Burrows of giving concocted evidence at the trial of Arthur Freeman, the man serving a life sentence for the murder of his daughter Darcey.\\" The Age reported on McGauran's speech in the Australian Senate, saying \\"Senator McGauran said defence lawyers used Professor Burrows as a 'gun for hire' and 'psychiatrist of last resort' and one who will sing whatever song the defence wants\\". On 21 June 2011 McGauran delivered his valedictory speech to the Senate. He referred to his recent performances as an extra in Opera Australia's season of The Pearl Fishers, saying \\"That is the thrill of politics: it is an opera. I hope I played it well. So now I leave the stage and the curtain must fall.\\" Post-political career McGauran is now a religion, ethics and commerce & law teacher at Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School. He also helps run the Ivanhoe Girls' politics club. He works secretly for Haigh's chocolates and is an avid opera watcher.

Sanders, Karen Young and Danielle Harris. The film was released by Universal Pictures on December 6, 1996, in the United States, and on December 26 in the United Kingdom. Plot In upstate New York, a waste management firm loads barrels of toxic waste onto trucks, intending to illegally dispose of them at a site in New Jersey. They are shown heading into the Holland Tunnel along with several commuters, including struggling playwright Maddy Thompson (Amy Brenneman), a bus of juvenile offenders, a vacationing family, an elderly couple with a dog, and sporting goods retailer Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen). Meanwhile, a gang of robbers grabs gems from a gem buyer after mugging him and takes his car to escape the NYPD by racing into the tunnel. The gang force their way through the north tube traffic, where the driver loses control, smashing though a security booth and into one of the trucks, causing it to detonate, and resulting in a sympathetic detonation of the remaining trucks. The tunnel entrances cave in, and a devastating fireball sweeps through the tunnel, incinerating the majority of the motorists within it. About to enter the Manhattan end of the tunnel, former New York City Emergency Medical Services Chief Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone), now working as a taxi driver, witnesses the fireball erupting from the entrance. While racing to help whoever he can he runs into an old EMS colleague, who tells him that the tunnel is severely damaged, and could come down if any wrong moves are made. Kit then checks with tunnel administrators, and finds that most of the old exits have been sealed off or are considered unsafe. Kit makes his way into the tunnel through the ventilation system, risking his life as the massive fans can only be slowed down for a short time. A group of the survivors trapped inside band around Nord, who believes he can find a way out through the mid-river passage, a service corridor running between the north and south tubes. Kit arrives and finds Nord, warning him that the passage could come down at any moment, but Nord dismisses the possibility. Kit barely escapes as the mid-river collapses, killing Nord, and causing another explosion which kills a juvenile offender. Water begins seeping in from the river above, and Kit uses an explosive to stop the leak. Police officer George Tyrell (Stan Shaw) returns from investigating the Manhattan end and is crushed under a truck as the road shifts. The group manage to free him before he can drown, but he is left with a broken neck. The water level continues to rise and the angry survivors confront Kit. He claims he can slow it down but not stop it, as the clean-up effort on the Manhattan side of the tunnel is causing water to enter their side. Kit recalls that there are sleeping quarters beside the tunnels (left over from the tunnel's construction) and asks George how to access them. Kit finds one by swimming under a security booth, and leads the group to this area, but George has to be left behind. He gives Kit a bracelet intended for his girlfriend Grace (Vanessa Bell Calloway), and tells him to \\"get them to daylight\\". Eleanor (Claire Bloom), one of the elder survivors, is distressed that her late son's dog Cooper is missing. She refuses to go on, then suddenly yet quietly passes away, presumably from hypothermia. The group moves to another room as the first one floods, convincing Eleanor's husband Roger (Colin Fox) to come with them. As they reach the top of an old wooden staircase, Kit notices Cooper swimming in the water below and dives down to rescue him, passing him up to one of the survivors, but a beam falls and destroys the lower half, sending Kit into the water. Maddy tries to help Kit up, but she falls as well, as more of the staircase is knocked down. The main group escape through a manhole into daylight while the corridor caves in behind them, but not before one of the survivors takes a flashlight from his daughter and tosses it to Kit, leaving Kit and the hysterical Maddy behind. Kit and Maddy swim around looking for a possible way out, with the main highway tunnel now almost completely submerged. Kit realizes he will have to use his explosives to cause a \\"blow out\\" and rip the tunnel roof open. A mass of mud crushes Kit and Maddy tries to pull him out. The blast forces Maddy towards the surface, but Kit gets stuck in the mud. Maddy finds a barely conscious Kit and keeps him afloat, as a boat discovers them offshore. Lying on a stretcher, Kit sees Grace in the crowd and hands her George's bracelet. Maddy insists on riding with him in the ambulance, to which Kit replies \\"on one condition; we gotta take the bridge.\\" Cast * Sylvester Stallone as Chief Kit Latura, a disgraced former New York City Emergency Medical Services (EMS) chief who tries to save the survivors trapped inside the tunnel.

After 55 weeks, the film earned $33 million in the US and $126.2 million internationally for a total of $159.2 million. =Critical response= The film has a 27% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews and an average rating of 4.94 out of 10. The critical consensus reads: \\"The opening's got a great fiery explosion and Stallone puts in another earnest, sympathetic performance, but all else in Daylight feels designed to annoy the audience into submission.\\" There were, however, some moderate and positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, commenting, \\"Daylight is the cinematic equivalent of a golden oldies station, where you never encounter anything you haven't grown to love over the years. At one point, when a trapped civilian asks him if they have a chance, I expected him to say, 'Calm down, lady. I've done this in a dozen other movies.'\\" Empire gave the film four stars out of five, stating, \\"Daylight is great because it never tries to be any more than it is — a disaster movie with all the special- effects hoopla the '90s can bring.\\" Randy Edelman's musical score was also praised. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. About the movie, Stallone simply said: \\"The premise was really good but it didn't deliver\\". =Accolades= The film won a Golden Reel Award for best Sound Editing and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category (Richard L. Anderson and David A. Whittaker). It was also nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards, Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone) and Worst Original Song (Whenever There Is Love). For the 1996 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Stallone was nominated for Worst Actor too. The movie was famous for introducing Panerai special line of watches (Panerai Daylight) by the request of Stallone himself.

The genealogical work Hversu Noregr byggdist gives his father as Harald the Old, his grandfather as Valdar and his great-grandfather as Hróarr (i.e. the Hroðgar of Beowulf).Hversu Noregr byggdist, Chapter 3 Ynglinga saga Ynglingasaga, authored by Snorri Sturluson in c. 1230, relates that the Swedish king Ingjald Ill-ruler married his daughter Åsa to king Guðröðr of Scania. Åsa was her father's daughter and made Guðröðr murder his own brother Halfdan, the father of Ivar Vidfamne. As it seems, Ivar had to flee Scania after his father's death.Nerman (1925), p. 232. Later, she was the cause behind Guðröðr's death as well, and was forced to escape back to her father. People afterwards called her Åsa Ill-ruler similar to her father Ingjald. Now Ivar Vidfamne hastily returned to Scania. He mustered a large army and approached Ingjald and his daughter at a place in Svithiod called Ræning. Seeing themselves unable to fight the Scanians, the two committed suicide by burning themselves to death inside the hall. Ivar then subjugated large parts of the Baltic region.Nerman (1925), p. 224. Hervarar saga Whereas Ynglinga saga does not inform about Halfdan's mother, Hervarar saga provides the information that she was called Hild, the daughter of the Gothic king Heiðrekr Ulfhamr, the son of Angantyr who defeated the Huns.Tolkien (1960), p. 59. However, another source, Hversu Noregr byggdist, gives the name of Halfdan's mother, spouse of Harald the Old, as Hervor, daughter of Heiðrekr.Ellehøj (1965), p. 93. Hervarar saga then tells that Halfdan had the son Ivar Vidfamne, who attacked Ingjald Ill-ruler, which led to Ingjald's suicide by burning down his own hall at Ræning together with all his retinue. After this, Ivar Vidfamne conquered Sweden.Tolkien (1960), p. 59. Other sources Two other Icelandic 13th-century sources give Halfdan the Valiant an Anglo-Saxon connection. One of the sagas of Olaf Tryggvason says that he was married to Moald Digra, the aunt of a certain Kinrik (Cynric) whose son Olaf became tributary ruler in Northumbria under Halfdan's great-great-grandson Sigurd Ring.Saga Ólafs Konúngs Tryggvasonar (1825), Chapter 61, p. 110-1. Sögubrot, a fragmentary saga of some legendary Swedish and Danish kings, mentions that Halfdan was the overlord of Northumbria, as were his descendants Ivar Vidfamne and Harald Wartooth after him.Sögubrot, Chapter 4 In Sögubrot Halfdan is compared to \\"Balder among the Aesir, and all the gods wept [when he perished]\\". This is juxtaposed with his warlike and scheming son Ivar who is likened to the Midgard Serpent.Sögubrot, Chapter 3 References Literature * Ellehøj, Svend (1965) Studier over de ældste norrøne historieskrivning.

He was the only son of George Gordon, 15th Earl of Sutherland (1633–1703), and his wife, Jean Wemmyss. Upon his father's death in 1703 he succeeded as earl of Sutherland. He supported the revolution of 1688 and was a commissioner for the union of England and Scotland. He was a Scottish representative peer in four parliaments, president of the Board of Trade and manufactures, and lord-lieutenant of the eight northern counties of Scotland. In 1703 he was appointed a privy councillor by Queen Anne. He aided in putting down the Jacobite Rising of 1715. When the rebellion had been quashed, Gordon was invested by George I with the Order of the Thistle and was granted an annual pension of £1200 in recognition of his services. In 1719 he led his Regiment in the Battle of Glen Shiel, which brought to an end the third Jacobite rising. He resumed the name of Sutherland, instead of Gordon. In 1719 by decree of Lyon Court, he was thereafter recognised Chief of the Clan Sutherland. Family He married three times, first to Helen, daughter of Lord Dundonald; secondly to Katherine Tollemache, daughter of Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet; and thirdly to Frances Hodgson. He had two children with Helen: *William Gordon, Lord Strathnaver (19 December 168313 July 1720) who married Catherine Morrison *Jean Gordon (c. 1692, Scotland11 February 1747, Virginia)), who married James Lauderdale, the son of John Maitland, 5th Earl of Lauderdale.

James Sutherland of Uppat, of the 38th Foot, and Superintendent of the estate of the Countess of Sutherland at Dunrobin, making James Sutherland an illegitimate son to Gordon (mother unknown). Illegitimate children are fairly common and though unproven this would account for the mysterious and suspicious familiarity between James Sutherland and the acquisition of the Uppat estate, the military appointments, and the closeness to the Gordon family at large.

The term implies that people who speak different languages as their mother tongues have different thought processes. Linguistic determinism is the strong form of linguistic relativity (popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), which argues that individuals experience the world based on the structure of the language they habitually use. Guy Deutscher is one example of a linguistic relativist who maintains that language influences worldview.Deutscher, Guy. Through the Language Glass: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages. Cornerstone Digital, 2016. Friedrich Nietzsche lived before the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was formulated, however, many of his views line up with the assumptions of linguistic determinism. He is credited with the term \\"Language as a prison\\".Stewart, Kieran. “Nietzsche's Early Theory of Language in Light of Generative Anthropology - Anthropoetics XXII, No. 2 Spring 2017.” Anthropoetics, 11 Apr. 2017, http://anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap2202/2202stewart/. Alfred Korzybski also supports the hypothesis inadvertently through general semantics.Korzybski, Alfred. Science and Sanity: an Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics. Institute of General Semantics, 2005. The language that served as the basis of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is Hopi, specifically its notion of time.Whorf, B.L. (1956). \\"Science and Linguistics\\". In Carroll, J.B. Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. pp. 217. Later support for determinism comes from Pirahã language, which is known for lacking a numerical system.Frank, Michael C., et al. “Number as a Cognitive Technology: Evidence from Pirahã Language and Cognition.” Cognition, vol. 108, no. 3, 2008, pp. 819–824., doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2008.04.007. Overview The principle of linguistic relativity (or, in other words, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis) in its strong deterministic form first found its clear expression in writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. The term \\"Sapir–Whorf hypothesis” is considered a misnomer by linguists and academics, because Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co-authored any works (although they did work together, Sapir being Whorf's mentor), and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their writings their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms.Hill, Jane H; Mannheim, Bruce (1992), \\"Language and World view\\", Annual Review of Anthropology, 21: 381–406, doi:10.1146/annurev.an.21.100192.002121Kennison, Shelia (2013). Introduction to language development. Los Angeles: Sage. The two linguists were nevertheless among the first to formulate the principle of linguistic relativity. Sapir exercised the idea that language is essential to understanding one's worldview and that difference in language implies a difference in social reality. Though he never directly explored how language affects thought, significant traces of the linguistic relativity principle underlie his perception of language.Sapir, Edward (1929), \\"The status of linguistics as a science\\", Language, 5 (4): 207, doi:10.2307/409588, JSTOR 409588 Whorf took further and reformulated Sapir's thought in his essay “Science and Linguistics”. His take on linguistic relativity was more radical: in Whorf's view, the relationship between language and culture was a deterministic one and language played a crucial role in the perception of reality. Language is what gives the thought its expression and thus shapes it; in other words, thinking is determined by language. In \\"Science and Linguistics\\" Whorf stated that: According to Whorf, the formulation of ideas and thoughts is not a rational independent process but is determined by particular grammar and vocabulary of the language in which these ideas are expressed. The world around is organized and made sense of through language. Supporting Arguments = Hopi = Whorf's conclusion was largely based upon a close examination and extensive study of the Hopi Indian language spoken among natives of southwestern North America. During earlier years, Whorf published a number of essays in which he analyzed various linguistic aspects of Hopi. For example, a work called “An American Indian model of the universe” (1936) explores the implications of the Hopi verb system concerning the conception of space and time. In the course of his research, Whorf noticed that Hopi and some other languages (Hebrew, Aztec, and Maya) were built on a different plan from that of English and many other languages which he called SAE (Standard Average European) languages. He discovered several significant features differentiating Hopi from SAE languages that led him to the idea of linguistic determinism. For example, Hopi is a ‘timeless’ language, whose verbal system lacks tenses. Its assessment of time is different from SAE linear temporal view of past, present, and future. This varies with each observer: Hopi time is non-dimensional and cannot be counted or measured in a way SAE languages measure it, i.e. the Hopi will not say “I stayed six days,” but “I left on the sixth day.” What is crucial in their perception of time is whether an event can be warranted to have occurred, or to be occurring, or to be expected to occur. Hopi grammatical categories signify view of the world as an ongoing process, where time is not divided into fixed segments so that certain things recur, e.g. minutes, evenings, or days. The linguistic structure of SAE languages, on the other hand, gives its speakers a more fixed, objectified and measurable understanding of time and space, where they distinguish between countable and uncountable objects and view time as a linear sequence of past, present, and future. Whorf argues that this and numerous other differences imply a different way of thinking. Since thought is expressed and transmitted through language, it follows that a differently structured language must shape thought along its lines, thus influencing perception. Consequently, a Hopi speaker who perceives the world through the medium of his language must see reality through the patterns laid down by its linguistic structure. = Nietzsche = German philosopher Nietzsche famously wrote, \\"We cease to think if we do not want to do it under linguistic constraints,\\" which was originally translated incorrectly as \\"We have to cease to think if we refuse to do so in the prison-house of language.\\" The phrase \\"prison-house of language\\" came to represent the extreme position regarding linguistic determinism. Although Nietzsche's position was not quite as drastic as the prison-house view, he did believe that language acts as the building blocks of thought, fundamentally shaping and influencing it. This was his explanation as to why cultural differences exist: because the language is different, the thought process is therefore different. Nietzsche also wrote that there is the \\"will to power and nothing besides,\\" and this is another way Nietzsche expresses that language is a fixed structure that is responsible for the desires, thoughts, and actions of humans. This represents linguistic determinism, making language the \\"prison\\" that minds are therefore trapped in. According to Nietzsche things like table, or rain are incomprehensible without the words being present in language. = Guy Deutscher = Linguist Guy Deutscher is a supporter of linguistic relativity, the weaker counterpart of linguistic determinism. Relativity holds that language influences thought, but avoids the \\"language as a prison\\" view. In Deutscher's book Through the Language Glass, the chapter Where the Sun Doesn't Rise in the east discusses the language Guugu Yimithirr spoken by aboriginal Australians and how it reinforces linguistic relativity. Deutscher introduces the Guugu Yimithirr language, where they describe everything geocentrically based on its cardinal direction (the chair is to the East) rather than egocentrically (the chair is to your right). It is clear how this system of expressing position and location influenced the Guugu Ymithirr's conceptualization of space. Their description of objects' locations, within photos or on television, would change based on the rotation of the media because they described things using cardinal directions. For example, if there was a photograph with a tree on the left side of the photo and a girl on the right side, the speakers of Guugu Yimithirr would describe the tree as West of the girl. If the photo was then rotated 90 degrees clockwise the tree would now be described as North of the girl. The implications, as Deutscher sees it, were that the speakers of Guugu Yimithirr have a \\"perfect pitch\\" for direction and that their sense of direction is completely non-egocentric. In one experiment, speakers were asked to recall a very recent event and describe it. The people recalled their placement, as well as the placement of important people and objects around them perfectly, even accounting for their position in the retelling. Many years later, the same people were asked to recall that same event, and it was shown that over time, they were still able to accurately recall the directionality of objects and people. Deutscher argues that this example illustrates that geocentric direction is encoded into the memories of Guugu Ymithirr because their language requires it. More broadly, they see the world differently due to their unique conceptualization of space. = Pirahã = Similar to the claims that Hopi prevents its speakers from thinking about time, some linguists allege that the Pirahã language spoken by natives in South American Amazonia prevents its speakers from thinking about quantity and numbers.Everett, Caleb, and Keren Madora. “Quantity Recognition Among Speakers of an Anumeric Language.” Cognitive Science, vol. 36, no. 1, Mar. 2011, pp. 130–141., doi:10.1111/j.1551-6709.2011.01209.x. The speakers of Pirahã are also, for the most part, incapable of math. Peter Gordon has recently taken an interest in studying the speakers of the Pirahã language. He has conducted many experiments on a small amount of these speakers. Gordon highlights eight experiments involving seven Pirahã speakers. Six of the experiments were all related in that the speakers were instructed to match groups of items to the correct number displayed elsewhere. The other two experiments had them recall how many items had been placed into a container, and lastly differentiate between various containers by the number of symbols that were pictured on the outside. Gordon found that the speakers of Pirahã could distinguish between the numbers one, two, and three relatively accurately, but any quantity larger than that was essentially indistinguishable to them. He also found the larger the number involved, the worse the performance. Gordon concluded that speakers of Pirahã are restricted to thinking about numbers through symbols or other representations. These speakers think of things as small, larger, or many.Margolis, Eric. “Linguistic Determinism and the Innate Basis of Number.” https://www.margolisphilosophy.com/linguistic-determinism-and-the-innate- basis-of-number.html. The speakers showed no ability to learn numbers, even after being taught in the Portuguese language for eight months, not one individual could count to ten. Daniel Everett claimed that the Pirahã language also lacks recursion or nesting, which was previously thought to be a feature of all languages. This opens up the possibility that the thoughts of the speakers are influenced by their language in other ways as well. Whether or not Pirahã lacks recursion remains a topic of intense debate.Evans, Nicholas, and Stephen C. Levinson. “The Myth of Language Universals: Language Diversity and Its Importance for Cognitive Science.” Behavioral and Brain Sciences, vol. 32, no. 5, 2009, pp. 429–448., doi:10.1017/s0140525x0999094x. = General Semantics = General Semantics was a therapy program created by Polish- American scholar Alfred Korzybski in the 1920s for the purpose of altering behavior. It has been regarded as a reliable method and produced effective results concerning altering behavior. Language acts as the basis for the behavioral therapy; The methods used are based on the idea that language influences human thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Korzybski's program assumes that people misappropriate language, creating damaging effects. By clarifying language, participants create a more accurate mental representation, which in turn creates an emotional response. As such, the general idea behind general semantics is to alter your language to change the feelings created within the mind-space, so as to elicit the desired response. According to Korzybski, the mind consists of different silent and verbal levels. On the nonverbal levels, there exists feelings, thought, and nervous system responses, and on the verbal level there are language systems. He instructs people to understand any given word as just a lexical representation and nothing more and to react accordingly. This is to avoid misappropriation of thoughts and feelings attached to any one thing. Because this program has been shown to produce effective results, this has large implications that language determines thought, supporting linguistic determinism. = Additional Support = Other studies supporting the principle of linguistic determinism have shown that people find it easier to recognize and remember shades of colors for which they have a specific name. For example, there are two words in Russian for different shades of blue, and Russian-speakers are faster at discriminating between the shades than are English-speakers.Winawer, Jonathan (2007). \\"Russian blues reveal effects of language on color discrimination.\\" PNAS. 104 (19) 7780-7785; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0701644104 Linguistic determinism can also be evident in situations where the means of drawing attention to a certain aspect of an experience is language. For example, in French, Spanish or Russian there are two ways to address a person because those languages have two second person pronouns – singular and plural. The choice of pronoun depends on the relationship between the two people (formal or informal) and the degree of familiarity between them. In this respect, the speaker of any of those languages is always thinking about the relationship when addressing another person and therefore unable to separate those two processes.Comrie, Bernard (2012). \\"Language and Thought.\\" Linguistic Society of America Linguistic Society of America. https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/language-and-thought Criticism = Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown (1954) = Psycholinguists Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown were among the first to refute Whorf's ideas of linguistic determinism. They identify Whorf's major ideas as a) the world is experienced differently by speakers of different languages and b) language is causally linked to these cognitive differences. They explore the two types of evidence Whorf uses to argue for the existence of cognitive differences between linguistic communities: lexical differences and structural differences.  Lexical differences  Lenneberg and Brown analyze the example of Eskimo snow terms. They claim that Eskimo's three distinct terms for what English speakers would simply call \\"snow\\" does not indicate that English speakers cannot perceive these differences, but rather that they just do not label them. They go on to point out that, on occasion, speakers of English do classify different types of snow (i.e. \\"good-packing snow\\" and \\"bad-packing snow\\") but do so with phrases instead of a single lexical item. They conclude that English speakers' and Eskimo speakers' worldviews cannot differ in this way, given that both groups are able to discriminate between different types of snow.  Structural differences  To refute Whorf's notion that structural categories correspond to symbolic categories, Lenneberg and Brown point out that structural categories rarely have consistent meanings. When they do, these meanings are not necessarily evident to speakers, as the case of grammatical gender in French illustrates. All French words with feminine gender do not reflect feminine qualities, nor do they share any common attributes. Lenneberg and Brown conclude that the existence of structural classes alone cannot be interpreted as reflective of differences in cognition.  Conclusions  Lenneberg and Brown ultimately conclude that the causal relationship between linguistic differences and cognitive differences cannot be concluded based on the evidence Whorf provides, which is solely linguistic in nature. They do, however, appear to find the proposition worthy of study, and pursue the study of color terms in order to supplement linguistic evidence with psychological data. = Steven Pinker = Another outspoken critic of linguistic determinism is linguist Steven Pinker, known for his alignment with Chomsky's universalist ideas. In his book, The Language Instinct, Pinker dismisses linguistic determinism as a \\"conventional absurdity,\\" instead proposing a universal language of thought - termed Mentalese. He echoes Lenneberg and Brown's criticism that Whorf relied too heavily on linguistic data alone to draw conclusions regarding the relationship between language and thought. Regarding the color terminology debate, Pinker argues that although different languages label colors differently, this variation in language cannot change human's biological process of color perception; he also points out that there are universal tendencies in the color labels that languages possess (i.e. if a language has two terms, they will be for white and black; with three terms, add red; with four, add either yellow or green). Pinker's final criticism of linguistic determinism is with regard to the Hopi concept of time: he asserts that Whorf was completely mistaken in his characterization of the Hopi as having no concept of time and that the Hopi do in fact have tense, units of time, temporal metaphors, and a complex system of time- keeping. Pinker concludes that linguistic determinism derives from the tendency to equate thought with language, but evidence from cognitive science now illustrates that thought precedes language. In his eyes, humans think not in individual languages, but in a shared language of thought. In turn, knowledge of a particular language constitutes the ability to translate this Mentalese into a string of words for the sake of communication. = Additional Criticism = Linguistic determinism has been widely criticized for its absolutism and refuted by linguists. For instance, Michael Frank et al. continued Daniel Everett's research and ran further experiments on the Pirahã published in \\"Numbers as a cognitive technology,\\" and found that Everett was wrong, the Pirahã did not have words for \\"one,\\" or \\"two,\\" but instead had words for \\"small,\\" \\"somewhat larger,\\" and \\"many.\\" For example, one may perceive different colors even while missing a particular word for each shade, like New Guinea aborigines can distinguish between the colors green and blue even though they have only one lexical entry to describe both colors.Masharov, Mikhail (2006). \\"Linguistic relativity: does language help or hinder perception?\\" Current Biology, , Vol: 16, Issue: 8, Page: R289-91 In communities where language does not exist to describe color, it does not mean the concept is void – rather the community may have a description or unique phrase to determine the concept. Everett describes his research into the Pirahã tribe who use language to describe color concepts in a different way to English speakers: “[…] each word for color in Pirahã was actually a phrase. For example, biísai did not mean simply ‘red’. It was a phrase that meant ‘it is like blood’.” Everett, D. (2013). Language, Culture and Thinking. London: Profile Books. Thus, in its strong version ‘Whorfian hypothesis’ of linguistic determination of cognition has been widely refuted. In its weaker form, however, the proposal that language influences thinking has frequently been discussed and studied.  In Literature and Media  = George Orwell's 1984: Newspeak = In Orwell's famous dystopian novel, 1984, the fictional language of Newspeak provides a strong example of linguistic determinism. The restricted vocabulary and grammar make it impossible to speak or even think of rebelling against the totalitarian government, instead aligning its speakers with the ideology of Ingsoc. Newspeak highlights the deterministic proposition that if a language does not have a means to express certain ideas, its speakers cannot conceptualize them. Orwell devotes the Appendix to a description of Newspeak and its grammar: > The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for > the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to > make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when > Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a > heretical thought—that is, a thought diverging from the principles of > Ingsoc—should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is > dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and > often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could > properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the > possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. It is worth noting that the main character Winston Smith, and others, were able to both conceive and speak of rebellion, despite the influences of Newspeak. 1984 does, however, take place before the full imposition of Newspeak; characters spoke both a combination of Newspeak and Oldspeak (standard English), which may have allowed for heretical thought and action. = Arrival (2016) = Based on the short story \\"Story of Your Life\\" by Ted Chiang, the science-fiction film Arrival rests on the notion of linguistic determinism. It follows linguist Louise Banks as she is recruited to decipher the messages of extraterrestrial visitors to Earth. As she learns their language of complex circular symbols, she begins to see flashes of her daughter's life and death. It later becomes evident that these flash back-like visions are glimpses into her future. By acquiring the alien language and its nonlinear notion of time, Banks is able to see both past and future. The award-winning movie illustrates an example of the strong version of the Sapir- Whorf Hypothesis since it presupposes that language determines thought. Learning an extraterrestrial language affected Banks's worldview so drastically that it completely transformed her perception of time.Levy, S. et. al (Producers), & Villenueve, Denis (Director). (2016) Arrival. [Motion Picture]. United States: Paramount Pictures. = Experimental languages in Science Fiction = The possibility of linguistic determinism has been explored by a variety of authors, mostly in science fiction. There exist some languages, like Loglan, Ithkuil and Toki Pona for instance, which have been constructed for the purpose of testing the assumption. However, no formal tests appear to have been done. Role in literary theory Linguistic determinism is a partial assumption behind developments in rhetoric and literary theory.Mcgraw, Betty R., et al. “Dissemination.” SubStance, vol. 12, no. 2, 1983, p. 114., doi:10.2307/3684496. For example, French philosopher Jacques Derrida dissected the terms of \\"paradigmatic\\" hierarchies (in language structures, some words exist only with antonyms, such as light/dark, and others exist only with relation to other terms, such as father/son and mother/daughter; Derrida targeted the latter). He believed that if one breaks apart the hidden hierarchies in language terms, one can open up a \\"lacuna\\" in understanding, an \\"aporia,\\" and free the mind of the reader/critic. Similarly, Michel Foucault's New Historicism theory posits that there is a quasi- linguistic structure present in any age, a metaphor around which all things that can be understood are organized. This \\"episteme\\" determines the questions that people can ask and the answers they can receive. The episteme changes historically: as material conditions change, so the mental tropes change, and vice versa. When ages move into new epistemes, the science, religion, and art of the past age look absurd.Dzelzainis, Martin. “Milton, Foucault, and the New Historicism.” Rethinking Historicism from Shakespeare to Milton, pp. 209–234., doi:10.1017/cbo9781139226431.014. Some Neo-Marxist historians have similarly looked at culture as permanently encoded in a language that changes with the material conditions. As the environment changes, so too do the language constructs.

The onset of scholastic chess in the United States began in the early 1970s due to the \\"Fischer Boom\\", the phenomenon of markedly increased interest in chess in the United States due to the ascendency of eventual world champion Bobby Fischer. The first large-scale open national scholastic chess tournament was the National High School Championship, which was started by Bill Goichberg in 1969; the winner of the inaugural event was John Watson.A History of the National High School Chess Championship Since the 1990s, the number of student participants in national scholastic chess tournaments has also been steadily climbing, as shown by the rapid growth of the major national championship, the National Scholastic Chess Championships. Of course, with the exception of the few students competing at the top level, most participants are there to make friends, learn new skills, and simply have a good time. Tournaments =Format of tournaments= As far as the competition and awards are concerned, there are both team and individual awards at each grade and skill level. This format encourages players of all levels to compete for trophies and awards against opponents of similar playing ability. Generally, tournaments consists of seven rounds (games) spread over three days, where players with the same score coming into that round are paired against each other. With one point for a win, half a point for a draw, and zero points for a loss, the players with the highest individual score after seven rounds are ranked for individual awards. In the team competition, the four highest scoring players from a particular school or club sum their scores for an overall team score. With so many scoring possibilities based on many individual outcomes, the team event usually causes the most discussion, planning and anticipation between coaches, players, and parents. =Nationals= The major national scholastic chess championships are the National High School (K-12) championship (est. 1969), National Junior High School (K-9) championship (est. 1973), the National Elementary (K-6) championship (est. 1976), and the National Primary (K-3) championship (est. 1983). These tournaments, held annually during the spring, have been around for the longest period of time, and typically attract the most participants, with the National Elementary championship often being the largest event (in terms of participants). Only five players in history have won the National Elementary, Junior High School and High School championships: Joel Benjamin, Joshua Waitzkin, Nawrose Nur, Danial Asaria, and Harutyun Akopyan; only Waitzkin, Nur, and Asaria have won the National Primary championship as well. Danial Asaria won the 2020 High School Senior Rapid, the 2016 National Junior High School Chess Championship K-8, the 2015 National K-12 Grade Championship, the National Junior Chess Congress 2014, and the 2012 National Elementary Chess championship.Chess Life 2006 Yearbook Akshat Chandra won the National High School Championship (K-12) in 2015, and the SuperNational Junior High School Championship (K-9) in 2013, both in his first and only appearance, but never played in the National Elementary Championship due to his late start in Chess. Two prominent scholastic events which precede these tournaments in inception are the United States Junior Open championship (open to all players under the age of 21), and the United States Junior Invitational (Closed) championship (open to the top nine rated players under age 20 plus the previous year's U.S. Junior Open champion). These two are the oldest scholastic tournaments in the United States, with the winner of the U.S. Junior Closed being declared the United States Junior Chess Champion. Notable winners of the United States Junior Open (est. 1946) include Arthur Bisguier, Bobby Fischer, Yasser Seirawan, Greg Shahade, Shearwood McClelland III, Jennifer Shahade, and Asuka Nakamura.Idaho Chess History - 1957Black Ivy League Alumni Spotlight: May 2003 These tournaments are typically held during the summer. Previous winners of the United States Junior Invitational (est. 1966) include Larry Christiansen, Patrick Wolff, Joshua Waitzkin, Tal Shaked, Hikaru Nakamura, Robert Hess, Ray Robson, and Akshat Chandra. The preeminent invitational championship for players under age 16 is the U.S. Cadet Championship, which consists of the top eight rated players under then age of 16. Previous winners of this championship include Tal Shaked, Vinay Bhat, Aaron Pixton, and Jordy Mont-Reynaud. In 1985, a new national scholastic championship, known as the Denker Tournament of High School Champions was inaugurated, pitting the scholastic high school champions of each state against each other for this championship. Previous winners include Alexander Fishbein, Ilya Gurevich, Jesse Kraai, and Abby Marshall. This tournament is typically held during the summer at the same time as the U.S. Open Chess Championship. In 1991, another new national championship was introduced, known as the National School Grade championships. The idea of this tournament was to determine national individual and team championships for each grade (Kindergarten through 12th grade). This tournament typically occurs in late November/early December. Previous winners include Vinay Bhat, Fabiano Caruana, Abby Marshall, Shearwood McClelland III, Asuka Nakamura, Hikaru Nakamura, and Ray Robson. In the 2000s, new national championships held include the National Youth Action championship (held in November) and the U.S. Junior Chess Congress (held in February). Unofficially, the record for most individual national championships is 13, shared by Harutyun Akopyan and Asuka Nakamura.The Nakamura Brothers In 2013, US Junior Chess Champion was GM Daniel Naroditsky, and in 2014 it was GM Kayden Troff.US Chess Championships Official Page http://uschesschamps.com Previous repeat team winners Previous repeat winners of the team events for the different age groups include the Julia R. Masterman School, from Philadelphia, PA, Stuyvesant High School and Hunter College High School, both from New York, NY, The Shelby School, from Payson, AZ, Catalina Foothills High School, from Tucson, AZ, and Edward R. Murrow High School, in Brooklyn, NY, the subject of a 2007 book, The Kings of New York: A Year Among the Geeks, Oddballs and Geniuses Who Make Up America's Top High-School Chess Team, by Michael Weinreb. =Supernationals= Normally the major tournaments (high school, junior high school, elementary/primary) will be held in different locations at different times, to allow participation in multiple events. However, beginning in 1997, there has been a single event known as the Supernationals where all events are held in one place simultaneously; the idea of the Supernationals was born in the early 1990s partially in response to concerns that young prodigies may win more than one championship in the same year (for example, the national elementary and national junior high school championship). This event currently occurs every four years; the previous two Supernational events have shown huge participation numbers. The Dean of Scholastic Chess At the 2018 US Chess Delegate's Meeting, in Middleton, Wisconsin, Dewain Barber was named \\"Dean of Scholastic Chess\\". Barber has been a tremendous advocate of scholastic chess in the United States and has contributed to the development of a national invitational events for middle school state champions.

Consolmagno, SJ (born September 19, 1952), is an American research astronomer, physicist, Jesuit religious brother, Director of the Vatican Observatory, and President of the Vatican Observatory Foundation. Life Consolmagno attended the University of Detroit Jesuit High School before he obtained his S.B. (1974) and S.M. (1975) degrees at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. (1978) at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, all in planetary science. After postdoctoral research and teaching at Harvard College Observatory and MIT, in 1983 he joined the US Peace Corps to serve in Kenya for two years, teaching astronomy and physics. After his return he took a position as Assistant Professor at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. In 1989 he entered the Society of Jesus, and took vows as a brother in 1991. On entry into the order, he was assigned as an astronomer to the Vatican Observatory, where he also serves as curator of the Vatican Meteorite collection, a position he has held since then. In addition to his continuing professional work in planetary science, he has also studied philosophy and theology. His research is centered on the connections between meteorites and asteroids, and the origin and evolution of small bodies in the solar system. In addition to over 40 refereed scientific papers, he has co-authored several books on astronomy for the popular market, which have been translated into multiple languages. During 1996, he took part in the Antarctic Search for Meteorites, ANSMET, where he discovered a number of meteorites on the ice fields of Antarctica. An asteroid was named in his honor by the International Astronomical Union, IAU in 2000: 4597 Consolmagno. He believes in the need for science and religion to work alongside one another rather than as competing ideologies. In 2006, he said, \\"Religion needs science to keep it away from superstition and keep it close to reality, to protect it from creationism, which at the end of the day is a kind of paganism - it's turning God into a nature god.\\" Consolmagno was recently the Chair of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society,Current Division of Planetary Science Officers at aas.org serving from October 2006 to October 2007. Consolmagno is a popular speaker as well as a writer of popular science.

It opened on Broadway in 1929 and was adapted for a film two years later. The title is a reference to the hit 1927 song \\"Fifty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong\\" by Willie Raskin, Billy Rose, and Fred Fisher, which compared free attitudes in 1920s Paris with censorship and prohibition in the United States. The musical's plot is consistent with the standard boy-meets-girl plots of musical comedies of the first half of the twentieth century. History Fifty Million Frenchmen was the first of seven Porter musicals to have the book written or co-written by Herbert Fields. This was also the first musical directed by Monty Woolley.Green, Stanley (1984). The World of Musical Comedy. Da Capo Press. , p. 146 Synopsis Peter Forbes, a young American millionaire, journeys to Paris and bets his friends Billy Baxter and Michael Cummins that he can live without his money for a month and, while doing so, get engaged to Looloo Caroll, a young woman he adores. She is in Paris with her parents and her best friend Joyce. The catch is that Peter has one month, until July 4, to throw their engagement party at the Chateau Madrid. Trying to woo Looloo while penniless, he endures humiliation. His first job is as a tour guide, but much to his dismay, he has caught the eye of Violet Hildegarde, a fur-buyer who sends risqué French postcards to her children (\\"Where Would You Get Your Coat?\\"). An aspiring singer, May DeVere, also becomes interested in Peter. Since Peter has no time, Looloo and Billy have begun flirting. Everyone goes to the racetrack, where Louis Pernasse tells Peter that the race is fixed and Toujours Moi will win, and he takes Peter's and May's money to place a bet. It appears that the horse has lost and Peter tears up his ticket, but the winner is disqualified and he has won. However, Looloo thinks he is being selfish in not sharing his winnings (since she had lent him some money) and leaves him (\\"You Don't Know Paree\\"). In another week, Pernasse is preparing a party for Looloo's mother, who plans to match her with a poor but titled Grand Duke (\\"The Queen of Terre Haute\\"). Mr. Carroll, distressed at the cost, gets drunk, and Looloo does not attend, as she has no desire to marry the Grand Duke. On July 4, Peter is a dance-host at the Chateau Madrid. As all arrive, Billy and Michael are still chasing Violet and Joyce. Peter, with the pressure of the time-limit bet, proposes. Just then Pernasse tells him to dance with a customer and Looloo starts to leave, confused and embarrassed. Peter and Pernasse have words about the torn-up ticket and Looloo realizes that he was telling the truth. She trusts him and they become engaged as midnight arrives.

Other variations include Lefèbvre, Lefèvre, Lefeuvre (western France) and Lefébure (northern France and Normandy). In the Occitan and Arpitan extension area, the variation is Fabre, Favre, Faure, Favret, Favrette or Dufaure and in Corsica Fabri (cf. Italian Fabbri, Fabri). In Celtic-speaking Brittany, the corresponding name is Le Goff(ic), with the article le to translate Breton ar. For Anglophone pronunciation purposes, the name has evolved, especially in the United States and Anglophone regions of Canada mainly by Acadians, among whom it is also a common surname, to LaFave, LeFave, Lefever and Lafevre, as well as other variant spellings. The English surname Feaver is also derived from Lefebvre. (See Lefèvre for more.) The name derives from faber, the Latin word for \\"craftsman\\", \\"worker\\"; used in Late Latin in Gaul to mean smith. Many northern French surnames (especially in Normandy) are used with the definite masculine article as a prefix (Lefebvre, Lefèvre; a more archaic spelling is Le Febvre), with the contracted masculine article as a prefix (Dufaure) in the south of France, or without article/prefix (Favre, Faure) in the south of France, but the meaning is the same.Albert Dauzat, Jean Dubois, Henri Mitterand, Noms et prénoms de France, Larousse 1981.

Early life Beverley Francis was born on 15 February 1955 in Geelong, Victoria, the youngest of five children. In 1976, she graduated from the University of Melbourne, where she obtained a degree in physical education and a teaching diploma. She then worked as a high school physical education and mathematics teacher for eight years.Bev Francis Powerhouse Career =Shot put= As a teenager, Francis became an accomplished shot putter. In February 1974, she began serious training. In 1977, she broke the Australian shot put record. From 1977 to 1979 and 1981 to 1982, she was an Australian track and field team member. She missed the 1980 track season due to a knee injury. In 1982, she won the Australian national shot put championships. Along with shot put, she performed the discus throw, javelin throw, and 100 meter reserve. =Powerlifting= In 1980, Francis held all world records in the weight class. At the 1981 World Powerlifting Championships, she set a world record when she bench pressed , the first woman's bench press over 300 lb. At the 1982 Australian Powerlifting Championships in Adelaide, she set a world record in the class with a squat of . She won gold medals in her weight class in the International Powerlifting Federation Championships from 1980 to 1985. Best lifts * Squat – * Bench press – * Deadlift – =Bodybuilding= Professional career After becoming the first woman to bench press over , a picture of Francis striking a most muscular pose, or \\"the crab\\", while wearing a bikini appeared in several bodybuilding magazines around the world. She possessed far more muscular size than the most muscular female bodybuilders at the time. Her powerlifting accolade led to her being invited by producer George Butler to take part in the film Pumping Iron II: The Women, which was being shot around the Cesar's World Cup being held in Las Vegas in December 1983. At that contest, she said she should have been \\"first or last\\". She placed in the middle as 8th among 15 competitors.BEV’S LAST STAND As Seen Live on ESPN Disappointed with the results, she attempted to reinvent her physique along the lines of what was being rewarded, especially after hearing that she was \\"too muscular\\" for the judges' tastes. Francis guest-posed at the 1985 Mr. Olympia competition, igniting the audience. She finished 10th in her Ms. Olympia debut in 1986. In 1987, she won the World Pro Championships. She followed up with three 3rd-place finishes at the Ms. Olympia in 1987, 1988, and 1989, then moved into 2nd place at the Ms. Olympia in 1990 (as runner-up to Lenda Murray). She had overhauled her physique radically from that 1983 Cesar's World Cup, when she was told she was \\"too muscular\\", but at the 1990 Olympia she was told she was \\"not muscular enough\\" to top Murray. Determined to win their next meeting, she resolved to build the most densely muscled physique ever seen on a female up to that point. = Ms. Olympia 1991 = The 1991 Ms. Olympia contest was the first to be televised live by ESPN, broadcasting a women's bodybuilding contest to the largest audience ever at the time (and contributing to the ensuing controversy). To facilitate the network's needs, the competition was held over two days. Rounds one (symmetry) and two (muscularity) were held on Saturday evening, 12 October 1991, whilst rounds three (posing) and four (posedown) were conducted 24 hours later, with the Sunday night proceedings broadcast live. At the prejudging, Francis walked out with of dense and conditioned muscles stacked on her frame. The audience gasped—none had seen such musculature on a woman before. Almost all the competitors came in considerably larger than at the last competition, surprising not just the mainstream ESPN viewers, but some bodybuilding fans as well. The defending champion Murray was herself 11 lb heavier than the previous year. At the end of the first night's judging, Francis led the field, four points ahead of Murray. On the second night, just before the start of the final two rounds, ESPN (in an unprecedented move for professional bodybuilding) flashed up the half-time scores for their national audience and those inside the Shrine Auditorium to see Francis in the lead. Since the posing rounds had never been recognized as opportunities for a lagging competitor to come from behind, most insiders, including Francis herself, predicted that she only had to avoid falling over to take the title. However, at the conclusion of the second night's events, as Francis stood onstage holding hands with Murray, she was announced in 2nd place, with a score of 31 points to Murray's 32. Francis's hand rose halfway to her face in shock before she regained her composure, smiled, and congratulated Murray. This was the slimmest margin of victory yet for a Ms. Olympia win, with Murray edging Francis by only one point. The audience and commentators were thrown off by this result, since Francis was in the lead after the first two (more contentious) rounds, only to be overtaken somehow in the concluding set. It was usually suggested that the IFBB and ESPN leadership did not want a woman carrying more muscle mass than most middleweight men to be recognized as the planet's premier female bodybuilder, and instructed the judges to swing the contest in Murray's favor. Such interference was not unheard of in the male competition (most controversially at the 1980 Mr. Olympia). A few months later, the IFBB issued a new policy announcement warning that excessive overt muscularity would be marked down, sparking persistent debate over the subjective criteria and \\"how much is too much\\".Ms. Olympia Turns 30 Francis retired afterwards, citing disgust over her controversial loss. She stated in 1993: Body image and judging criteria Francis and her career played a significant role in the concurrent turmoil over ideals of form (especially regarding muscle mass) and judging criteria for female bodybuilders, which often relied on vague, contentious, and shifting notions of a \\"feminine\\" figure. Her 1983 debut in the made-for-film Cesar's World Cup received much attention for potentially pushing the sport in a more muscular direction. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem commented that her performance \\"redefined the boundaries of femininity\\". However, when she placed 8th, her loss led her to spend years changing her look in an attempt to meet the apparent ideal preferred by the judges. Despite years of attempting to achieve higher scores on the femininity aspect of the contests with measures including a nose job, hair bleaching, and slimming down her physique by losing muscle, Francis still failed to take first place at the major competitions. However, after successfully developing methods of achieving a more symmetrical physique while maintaining the size built from her powerlifting background (the three power lifts are central to bodybuilding, and bodybuilders with backgrounds as champion powerlifters tend to have tremendous size and density for their frames), she won the World Championship in 1987. She continued to experiment with her physique, leading to a disappointing 1990 Ms. Olympia. There, she was criticized as not having the fullness or muscularity compared to winner Lenda Murray, and subsequently worked on becoming as massive and symmetrical as possible for the 1991 Olympia. After the ensuing 2nd-place finish and resulting controversy, she retired from bodybuilding. Marcia Pally, in a 1985 article on the film Pumping Iron II: The Women, had reported that people often thought of Francis as lesbian. Francis commented: \\"The categorization annoys me more than what I'm accused of. I've been called a transsexual, a man, and a lesbian. People have to stop putting together things that don't belong together. Muscles don't make a woman a lesbian.\\"Building Bodies edited by Pamela L.

She has also produced a training video titled Hardcore Training with World Champion Bev Francis. She has contributed articles to the monthly Female Bodybuilding magazine and has written for the men's magazines Flex, Iron Man, and Muscle & Fitness. In 1985, Francis gained notice through her role in the movie Pumping Iron II: The Women. The movie featured her in the 1983 Cesar's World Cup. The film casts her in a controversial role within the ongoing debate over femininity and female muscularity, with her naturally massive size and muscular development challenging preconceived notions about the limits of female bodybuilding. Francis was featured in the 2001 TLC documentary The Greatest Bodies.The Greatest Bodies (Part 2 of 5) Personal life At the 1983 Caesars World Cup, Francis met IFBB judge and powerlifter Steve Weinberger. She moved in with him in Long Island, New York and they were married on 30 September 1984. They have a son and daughter together. In 1986, she and her husband opened Bev Francis' Bodybuilding Gym in Long Island. In 1990, they expanded the gym to Bev Francis Gold's Gym in Syosset, New York. In 2005, the gym's name was changed to Powerhouse Gym, Bev Francis. She and her husband currently live in Syosset. Legacy From 1981 to the early 1990s, Francis earned the accolade of \\"Strongest Woman in History\\". She was the first woman in the world to bench press over . She broke over 40 world powerlifting records and was undefeated during her powerlifting career. She was inducted into the International Powerlifting Federation Hall of Fame in 1987.[Athletes Grow Strong in Syosset Gym ] Francis was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2000.

Located in Vershire, Vermont, The Mountain School was originally a four-year residential high school started in 1963 by Mac and Doris Conard. It was unique in its combination of first-class college preparatory studies and ecology-oriented hands-on farm experience. Mac and Doris, ready to retire after 20 years, sought a buyer who would maintain the mission of the school, and in 1984 found such a buyer in a group of teachers from Milton Academy, led by David and Nancy Grant. The Grants as co-directors reopened the school as a semester program, retaining the character and mission but allowing high school students from around the country to attend for one semester of their junior year. Today, students still attend for one term (fall or spring) during their junior year in high school, or the fall term of their senior year. 45 students are enrolled. The Mountain School offers a variety of academic classes. All students take English and Environmental Science, and electives include U.S. History, Chemistry, Physics, a variety of Math courses, Art, Humanities and Languages. In addition to five academic classes, the Mountain School provides students with an opportunity to explore the community around them by integrating speakers and panels into the curriculum. Students explore the social structure of the school itself as well. Currently, the faculty and staff is made up of 26 individuals, 13 of whom live on campus, some with families of their own. The Mountain School is also a working organic farm. The farm provides the majority of food for the school and is tended to by the students, teachers and three farm managers. In addition to a garden with a full harvest, the school has turkeys, chicken, sheep, beef cattle, pigs, and a llama. Students take care of all aspects of the farm with daily chores (morning and night) as well as a three-hour afternoon work period, six days a week. Work doesn't end when the students leave. A full summer crew of alumni or other interested parties spend the summer working on raising the new animals (born during spring semester), working on the vegetable harvest and, most importantly, haying. In the summer of 2003 alums from all years, as well as many of their family members, converged on Vershire in early August for a barn raising. During 2014 and 2015 an extensive array of solar panels was built at The Mountain School which offset nearly all of its electricity usage. This project is in line with The Mountain School's mission of 'knowing a place' and 'caring for that place.'

Modern ski poles are most commonly made from aluminum and carbon fiber, though materials such as bamboo are still used. Poles are used in alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (with the exception of aerials), and cross-country skiing. Ski jumpers do not use poles. History Wooden Cross Country ski poles, circa 1950. , the earliest ski pole was found in Sweden and dates back to 3623 BC, while the earliest depiction of a man with a ski pole was found in Norway in the form of a cave painting, dated at 4000 BC. Early skiers would use this pole for the purposes of balancing, braking, and turning. Alpine societies such as those in Nordic regions or the Altai mountains used their ski poles to hunt as well, giving them spear-like qualities. Skiers began to use two ski poles in 1741. This provided greater balance than one pole could provide and made pushing through the snow easier. Early ski poles were made of pine and bamboo, materials which today are used for novelty poles. US patents for steel ski poles began in 1933 when John B. Dickson invented a new design calling for the use of steel as the shaft material. This construction was superseded by Edward L. Scott, who is credited with popularizing the lightweight aluminum ski pole in 1959, deriving his modern design from golf club shafts. This new stiff and lightweight pole made it easier for skiers to pole-plant and initiate fast, short turns. The most modern material used in ski pole production is carbon fiber. A patent has been filed on a biocomposite material that can be used for ski poles, but this design has yet to be manufactured. Axel Composites has a patent for carbon fiber ski poles dating back to 1975, however, inventor David P. Goode's improved design from 1989 became the first widely produced. The carbon fiber pole builds on the same qualities of the aluminum pole: lightness and stiffness while being extremely strong. Features of ski poles * Basket: Near the bottom end of the shaft, designed to stop the pole from sinking significantly into deep snow. These can range from being small, aerodynamic cones used in racing, to large snowflake shaped baskets which are used in powder skiing. Many poles feature methods of easily switching between baskets, such as threading on the basket and pole. Ski pole grip with adjustable strap * Grip: Attached to the upper part of the pole is a grip with a strap. These are slipped over the wrist to improve the skiers hold on the grip and to prevent the loss of the pole in the event of a fall. When backcountry skiing, the wrist strap may not be used to prevent wrist injury if the pole should catch on an unseen branch or root. Releasable strap systems have been implemented by pole manufacturers as well, which serve to prevent wrist injuries in the event of a crash. * Length: Pole length varies according to use. Telescopic poles are available for adjustment while out skiing. * Material: As noted previously, poles come in a two overarching materials, aluminum and carbon, alongside niche materials such as wood. Ski poles will sometimes use a mixture of materials, such as carbon-kevlar composites. Pole types =Alpine skiing= Poles are used in alpine skiing to add propulsion and to aid in controlling upper body position at turn initiation. Note straight carbon-kevlar slalom poles with guards and small baskets Racing poles have their own unique distinctions. Super giant slalom, downhill, and speed skiing poles are designed to bend around the skier's body while in a tuck position to minimize drag. In slalom skiing, straight poles are used due to the reduced speeds and increased reliance on poles. Slalom poles will often come with a guard attached to the grip for the purpose of deflecting gates. Giant slalom skiers choose a straight or bent pole based on personal preference and situation; giant slalom courses can vary greatly in speed and in the case of slower courses, aerodynamic drag does not have as great a factor. =Cross-country skiing= Poles enable cross-country skiers to apply power to the snow, using arm motion; poles can also provide stability. In competitive cross-country skiing, poling technique is essential, especially so during a mass start in which double-poling is the main means of propulsion. Longer poles are used for cross country because of different techniques. Pole length for classic (aka diagonal-stride) technique is typically measured from the ground to the skier's armpit. For skating (aka freestyle) technique the length of the pole is typically from the ground to the skier's upper lip. These length selections balance between maximum thrust and technique considerations. Most Nordic ski pole manufacturers have sizing charts available. =Nordic walking= Nordic walking poles are largely similar to composite cross-country ski poles, just shorter in length and with a basket smaller than that of the racing cross country ski pole. The Nordic walking pole strap resembles a fingerless glove and is similar to the racing cross country ski pole strap.

Nelson appeared in episodes of many television programs, more than fifty motion pictures, and hundreds of stage productions. Early life Nelson was raised in North Carolina after having been born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was educated at Edwards Military Institute and Camp Lejeune High School, playing football and basketball at the latter school. He began acting while attending Tulane University in New Orleans. He left college after two years to study at the New York School of Radio and Television Technique. He served with the United States Navy as a radioman on the light cruiser USS Dayton. He took a position as a director at WDSU-TV in New Orleans. By 1956, acting became his central focus, and he moved to the Los Angeles area.  Career  Early in his career Nelson did stunt work for B-movie producer Roger Corman on the films Swamp Women (1956), Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957), Rock All Night (1957), Carnival Rock (1957), Night of the Blood Beast (1958), The Cry Baby Killer (1958), Teenage Cave Man (1958), and A Bucket of Blood (1959).

He made two guest appearances on CBS's Perry Mason, both times as the defendant; in 1961, he played Ward Nichols in \\"The Case of the Left-Handed Liar,\\" and in 1964, he played Dirk Blake, father of the title character, in \\"The Case of the Missing Button\\". Peyton Place and later roles In 1964, Nelson secured his most famous role, portraying Dr. Michael Rossi on the ABC drama Peyton Place, staying with the series during its entire run from 1964 to 1969. Nelson reprised his role in two made-for-TV movies, Murder in Peyton Place and Peyton Place: The Next Generation. After Peyton Place, Nelson worked in many more productions of all varieties. He teamed with former Peyton Place co-star Percy Rodriguez in a second television series, The Silent Force, which ran for 15 episodes in 1970-1971. He had guest starred with David Janssen in theThe Fugitive in 1963, and appeared as a different character later in the series.

(1973), Houston, We've Got a Problem (1974), The Missing Are Deadly (1975), Superdome (1978), Doctors' Private Lives (1978) and Crash (1978), and served as host on a morning talk show, The Ed Nelson Show, that he hosted for three years. During the 1980s, Nelson took on the role of patriarchal Senator Mark Denning in the daytime serial Capitol. In late 1986, Nelson was upset to discover that the show's writers had turned his character into a traitor, and quit the show in disgust, last airing in early January 1987, two months prior to the show's cancellation. He also continued appearing in theatrical films, such as Airport 1975 (1974), That's the Way of the World (1975), Acapulco Gold (1976), Midway (1976), For the Love of Benji (1977), Police Academy 3: Back in Training (1986), Brenda Starr (1989), The Boneyard (1991), Who Am I? (1998) and Runaway Jury (2003). He spent several years playing U.S. President Harry S. Truman onstage, having replaced James Whitmore for the National Tour of \\"Give 'Em Hell, Harry\\". Personal life While living in Los Angeles, Nelson was an active member of the Screen Actors Guild and was elected to the union board for many years. Nelson was a long- standing member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and maintained a long tradition of participation in voting for the Academy Awards. In the early 1970s, he ran for city council and mayor of San Dimas, California until a Federal Communications Commission ruling said that if he appeared in television programs his political opponents must be given equal time.  Later years  In 1999, Nelson returned to Tulane University to finish credits toward his undergraduate degree, which he completed the following year at age 71. He and his wife, Patsy, enjoyed semi-retirement visiting their six children and fourteen grandchildren. One of his children is actor Christopher S. Nelson. Until 2005, he had been teaching acting and screenwriting in New Orleans at two local universities there. Hurricane Katrina prompted him to move his family far to the north to Sterlington, Louisiana.

It translates approximately to \\"posture\\". The Kanji of this word means \\"base\\". Kamae is to be differentiated from the word , used in Japanese martial arts to mean stance. While tachi (pronounced dachi when used in a compound) refers to the position of the body from the waist down, kamae refers to the posture of the entire body, as well as encompassing one's mental posture (i.e., one's attitude). These connected mental and physical aspects of readiness may be referred to individually as and , respectively. Although it is a generic term, context may mean there's a default specific posture which is being implicitly referred to. e.g. many modern styles use kamae by itself as shorthand usually for the style's basic stance for sparring or self-defense. As a further note, there are also related verbs, and adding te to the end of kamae makes the command for . Thus, a karate instructor ordering the students to assume a front stance might shout, \\"Zenkutsu dachi, kamaete!\\"  In Aikido  Kamae is a basic stance, also defined as natural. In it, the body's three centers of gravity are aligned on a vertical axis of gravity. Those three centers begin with the head, then spinal column, and lower abdomen. This allows for a balanced stance, regardless of positioning of one's feet. It also allows one to move freely into any desired direction.  In Kendo  There are five basic kamae in Kendo: jōdan, chūdan, gedan, hassō and waki. Of these, chūdan-no- kamae (middle stance) is the most basic posture. It provides a balance between attacking and defensive techniques.  In Karate  The generally used form of kamae in karate is where the martial artist places his right hand guarding the solar plexus and the left hand outstretched at shoulder height. This to allow blocking while strikes are further from the body with the left hand and counter-strikes with the right hand (or vice versa depending on the stance).  In Taijutsu  The kamae in Taijutsu are considered as adaptable postures that occur as 'snapshots' of sequences of movement, rather than fixed attacking or receiving positions. The basic kamae is ichimonji-no-kamae, which refers to the 'straight-line' that reflects the shape of the body when adopting this position.

Biography  Born in Clifton, Bristol, England, he was the son of Dr. Thomas Beddoes, a friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Anna, sister of Maria Edgeworth. He was educated at Charterhouse and Pembroke College, Oxford. He published in 1821 The Improvisatore, which he afterwards endeavoured to suppress. His next venture, a blank-verse drama called The Bride's Tragedy (1822), was published and well reviewed, and won for him the friendship of Barry Cornwall. Beddoes' work shows a constant preoccupation with death. In 1824, he went to Göttingen to study medicine, motivated by his hope of discovering physical evidence of a human spirit which survives the death of the body.Donner 1950, pp. xxxvi- xxxvii. He was expelled, and then went to Würzburg to complete his training. He then wandered about practising his profession, and expounding democratic theories which got him into trouble. He was deported from Bavaria in 1833, and had to leave Zürich, where he had settled, in 1840. He continued to write, but published nothing. He led an itinerant life after leaving Switzerland, returning to England only in 1846, before going back to Germany. He became increasingly disturbed, and committed suicide by poison at Basel, in 1849, at the age of 45. For some time before his death he had been engaged on a drama, Death's Jest Book, which was published in 1850 with a memoir by his friend, T. F. Kelsall. His Collected Poems were published in 1851.  Evaluation  Critics have faulted Beddoes as a dramatist. According to Arthur Symons, \\"of really dramatic power he had nothing. He could neither conceive a coherent plot, nor develop a credible situation.\\"Donner 1950, p. lxxix. His plots are convoluted, and such was his obsession with the questions posed by death that his characters lack individuation; they all struggle with the same ideas that vexed Beddoes.Donner 1950, pp. xxxii–xxxiii. But his poetry is \\"full of thought and richness of diction\\", in the words of John William Cousin, who praised Beddoes' short pieces such as \\"If thou wilt ease thine heart\\" (from Death's Jest-Book, Act II) and \\"If there were dreams to sell\\" (\\"Dream- Pedlary\\") as \\"masterpieces of intense feeling exquisitely expressed\\".Cousin 1910, p. 32. Lytton Strachey referred to Beddoes as \\"the last Elizabethan\\", and said that he was distinguished not for his \\"illuminating views on men and things, or for a philosophy\\", but for the quality of his expression.Donner 1950, pp. xi, lxxxi. Philip B. Anderson said the lyrics of Death's Jest Book, exemplified by \\"Sibylla's Dirge\\" and \\"The Swallow Leaves Her Nest\\", are \\"Beddoes' best work. These lyrics display a delicacy of form, a voluptuous horror, an imagistic compactness and suggestiveness, and, occasionally, a grotesque comic power that are absolutely unique.\\"Dabundo 2011, p. 33.

Biography Hagedorn was born in Manila to a Scots-Irish-French-Filipino mother and a Filipino-Spanish father with one Chinese ancestor. Moving to San Francisco in 1963, Hagedorn received her education at the American Conservatory Theater training program. To further pursue playwriting and music, she moved to New York City in 1978. Joseph Papp produced her first play Mango Tango in 1978. Hagedorn's other productions include Tenement Lover, Holy Food, and Teenytown. Her mixed media style often incorporates song, poetry, images, and spoken dialogue. From 1975 until 1985, she was the leader of a poet's band -- The West Coast Gangster Choir (in SF) and later The Gangster Choir (in New York). In 1985, 1986, and 1988, she received MacDowell Colony fellowships, which helped enable her to write the novel Dogeaters, which illuminates many different aspects of Filipino experience, focusing on the influence of America through radio, television, and movie theaters. She shows the complexities of the love-hate relationship many Filipinos in diaspora feel toward their past. After its publication in 1990, her novel earned a 1990 National Book Award nomination and an American Book Award. In 1998 La Jolla Playhouse produced a stage adaptation.In 2001, the play adaptation premiered off-Broadway at The Public Theater. Hagedorn worked with playwrights and artists Robbie McCauley and Laurie Carlos as the collective Thought Music, which later expanded to include visual artist John Woo as well. Together Thought Music created a number of works including Teenytown (presented at La Mama in 1987) and class (presented at The Kitchen in 2000). Thought Music together investigated race, class, sexism, and the role of immigrants in the United States. Hagedorn, with Thought Music and on her own, has also collaborated with Urban Bush Women on works including Heat and Lipstick. Hagedorn lives in New York City with her daughters.

Established during the Spanish colonial period, it functions as the seat of Portobelo District. Located on the northern part of the Isthmus of Panama, it has a deep natural harbor and served as a center for silver exporting before the mid-eighteenth century and its destruction in 1739 during the War of Jenkins' Ear. It slowly rebuilt and the city's economy revived briefly in the late-nineteenth-century during the construction of the Panama Canal. In 1980, UNESCO designated the ruins of the Spanish colonial fortifications, along with nearby Fort San Lorenzo, as a World Heritage Site named Fortifications on the Caribbean Side of Panama: Portobelo-San Lorenzo. History Portobelo was colonized in 1597 by Spanish explorer Francisco Velarde y Mercado and quickly replaced Nombre de Dios as a Caribbean port for Peruvian silver. Legend has it that Christopher Columbus originally named the port \\"Puerto Bello\\", meaning \\"Beautiful Port\\", in 1502. After Francis Drake died of dysentery in 1596 at sea, he was said to be buried in a lead coffin near Portobelo Bay. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, it was an important silver-exporting port in New Granada on the Spanish Main and one of the ports on the route of the Spanish treasure fleets. The Spanish built defensive fortifications. The privateer William Parker attacked and captured the city in 1601 and Captain Henry Morgan repeated the feat in 1668. He led a fleet of privateers and 450 men against Portobelo, which, in spite of its good fortifications, he captured. His forces plundered it for 14 days, stripping nearly all its wealth while raping, torturing and killing the inhabitants. It was captured again in 1680 by John Coxon The British had a disaster in the Blockade of Porto Bello under Admiral Hosier in 1726. As part of the campaigns of the War of Jenkins' Ear, the port was attacked on November 21, 1739, and captured by a British fleet of six ships, commanded by Admiral Edward Vernon. The British victory created an outburst of popular acclaim throughout the British Empire. More medals were struck for Vernon than for any other 18th- century British figure. Across the British Isles, Portobello was used in place and street names in honor of the victory, such as Portobello Road in London, the Portobello area in Edinburgh, and the Portobello Barracks in Dublin. The Spanish quickly recovered the Panamanian town and defeated Admiral Vernon in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. Vernon was forced to return to England with a decimated fleet, having suffered more than 18,000 casualties.Duncan, Francis. History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, London, 1879, Vol.1, p.123, Quote:\\"...so reduced was this force in two years by disaster and disease, that not a tenth part returned to England...'thus ended in shame, disappointment, and loss, the most important, most expensive, and best concerted expedition that Great Britain was ever engaged in'...\\". Despite the Portobello campaign, British efforts to gain a foothold in the Spanish Main and disrupt the galleon trade were fruitless. Following the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Spanish switched from large fleets calling at few ports to small fleets trading at a wide variety of ports, developing a flexibility that made them less subject to attack. The ships also began to travel around Cape Horn to trade directly at ports on the western coast.

Since its debut on June 17, 1919, the strip has gained a large international readership, appearing in 900 newspapers in 21 countries. The initial appeal of the strip led to its adaptation to film, animation, popular song, and television. It added several terms and phrases to the English language and inspired the 1923 hit tune \\"Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)\\" with lyrics by Billy Rose, as well as the 1923 record, \\"Come On, Spark Plug!\\" Barney Google himself, once the star of the strip and a very popular character in his own right, has been almost entirely phased out of the feature. An increasingly peripheral player in his own strip beginning in the late 1930s, Google was officially \\"written out\\" in 1954, although he occasionally returned for cameo appearances, often years apart. From a period between 1997 and 2012, Barney Google was not seen in the strip at all. Google was reintroduced to the strip in 2012, and has been seen occasionally since, making several week-long appearances per year. Snuffy Smith, who was initially introduced as a supporting player in 1934, has now been the comic strip's central character for over 60 years. Nevertheless, the feature is still titled Barney Google and Snuffy Smith. As of June 17, 2019, Barney Google has run for an entire century, making it the third-longest running and uninterrupted comics series of all time, after Rudolph Dirks' The Katzenjammer Kids and Frank O. King's Gasoline Alley. After Gasoline Alley, it is the second-longest running newspaper comic still in syndication and producing new episodes as of 2019. Characters and story =Barney Google= Barney Google and Snuffy Smith Like Mutt and Jeff, Barney Google started out on the sports page. First appearing as a daily strip in the sports sections of the Chicago Herald and Examiner in 1919, it was originally titled Take Barney Google, F'rinstance. The title character, a little fellow (although he shrank in stature even more after the first year) with big \\"banjo\\" eyes, was an avid sportsman and ne'er- do-well involved in poker, horse racing, and prize fights. The \\"goggle-eyed, moustached, gloved and top-hatted, bulbous-nosed, cigar-chomping shrimp\\" (according to comics historian Bill Blackbeard) was relentlessly henpecked by \\"a wife three times his size\\" (as the song lyric goes). The formidable Mrs. Lizzie Google, or \\"the sweet woman\\", sued Barney for divorce and thereafter virtually disappeared from the strip. By October 1919, the strip was distributed by King Features Syndicate and was published in newspapers across the country. =Spark Plug= Beginning on July 17, 1922, the strip took a momentous turn in popularity with the seemingly innocuous introduction of an endearing race horse named \\"Spark Plug\\". Barney's beloved \\"brown-eyed baby\\" was a bow-legged nag that seldom raced, and was typically seen almost totally covered by his trademark patched blanket with his name scrawled on the side. Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz was known to his friends as Sparky, a lifelong nickname given to him by his uncle as a diminutive of Barney Google's Spark Plug. Comics historian Don Markstein noted: In deference to his enormous popularity during this period, the strip was retitled Barney Google and Spark Plug.McGrath, Charles. \\"Good Grief!\\" The New York Times Sunday Book Review, October 14, 2007. DeBeck's strip hit its peak of popularity with Spark Plug about the same time the song \\"Barney Google (Foxtrot)\\" by Billy Rose and Con Conrad was sweeping the country. It became one of the best known, most iconic novelty records of the 1920s, and has been recorded by such famous artists as Eddie Cantor and The Happiness Boys, The Andrews Sisters, and Spike Jones: Other popular characters and concepts introduced in the strip about this time include \\"Sunshine\\", Barney's black jockey, a troublesome ostrich named \\"Rudy\\", \\"Sully\\", a monocled champion wrestler, and the mysterious hooded fraternity \\"The Order of the Brotherhood of Billy Goats\\", a parody of mystic secret societies. (There was also a \\"Sisterhood of Nanny Goats\\" for the ladies.) Their password was \\"O-K-M-N-X\\" which, deciphered, stood for a standard breakfast order (\\"Okay, ham and eggs\\"). Barney was elected \\"Exalted Angora\\" in 1928. Billy DeBeck's Barney Google (February 5, 1931) =Snuffy Smith= In 1934, an even greater change took place when Barney and his horse visited the North Carolina mountains and met a volatile, equally diminutive moonshiner named Snuffy Smith. Hillbilly humor was extremely popular at the time (as Al Capp was proving with Li'l Abner). The strip increasingly focused on the southern Appalachian hamlet of \\"Hootin' Holler\\", with Snuffy as the main character. The mountaineer locals are extremely suspicious of any outsiders, referred to as \\"flatlanders\\" or even worse, \\"revenooers\\" (Federal Revenue agents). Snuffy was so popular that his name was added to the strip's title in the late 1930s. Eventually, Barney Google himself left Hootin' Holler in 1954 to return to the city, and was essentially written out of the strip except as a very occasional visitor. Google has appeared extremely rarely in the feature since the mid-1950s, but returned to Hootin' Holler for a visit in a series of strips beginning on February 19, 2012, with occasional visits since. Prior to 2012, Google had not appeared in the strip since January 5, 1997, over 15 years. Snuffy Smith (whose last name is pronounced \\"Smif\\" by virtually all the characters in Hootin' Holler) is an ornery little cuss, sawed-off and shiftless. He lives in a shack, mangles the English language, and has a propensity to shoot at those who displease him. He makes \\"corn-likker\\" moonshine in a homemade still and is in constant trouble with the sheriff. He wears a broad-brimmed felt hat almost as tall as he is, has a scraggly mustache and a pair of tattered, poorly patched overalls. He constantly cheats at poker and checkers. He also has some proclivity toward stealing chickens, which led to a brief but effective use of his character in a marketing campaign by the Tyson Foods corporation in the early 1980s. In 1937, he held the post of \\"Royal Doodle Bug\\" in the \\"Varmints\\" lodge; during this period, the strip heavily employed the catchphrase, \\"What did the Doodle-Bug say?\\", an apparent homage to \\"What did the Woggle-Bug say?\\" in L. Frank Baum and Walt McDougall's Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz strip of 1904–1905. Almost all of the characters in the strip (except the occasional visiting \\"flatlander\\") are exaggerated hillbillies in the classic burlesque tradition:Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon by Anthony Harkins, 2003 Oxford Univ. Press, pgs. 103–114 sharp-tongued gossipy women such as Snuffy's wife \\"Loweezy\\"; his baby \\"Tater\\"; his nephew \\"Jughaid\\"; his neighbors Elviney and \\"Lukey\\"King Features: Snuffy Smith characters (Lucas Ebenezer Hinks);November 17, 2008 Barney Google stripMarch 20, 2012 Barney Google strip the sanctimonious (but nonetheless ungrammatical) Parson; Silas, the owner of the General Store; the ostentatiously-badged Sheriff Tait, and others. Vehicles are rundown jalopies of a seeming 1920s vintage, even in the 1970s and beyond. The characters are drawn so that they appear to be talking out of the sides of their mouths. Topper strips =Bughouse Fables= On December 24, 1920, DeBeck began a gag panel called Bughouse Fables, featuring his observations of ordinary people doing foolish things, which he signed \\"Barney Google\\". This daily panel ran until November 13, 1937. DeBeck added Bughouse Fables as an accompanying topper strip to run with Barney Google on Sundays, from January 17 to May 9, 1926. =Bunky= On May 16, 1926, DeBeck began another topper strip, originally called Parlor, Bedroom and Sink—but better known as Bunky. Parlor Bedroom and Sink—which evolved into Parlor Bedroom and Sink Starring Bunky, and eventually simply Bunky—is an over-the- top parody of stage melodramas and movie and radio serials that were popular at the time. The title character \\"\\" (short for Bunker Hill, Jr.) was a hapless waif whose penniless parents, Bunker Hill, Sr. and Bibsy, had given birth to the strangely erudite newborn with the enormous nose on November 13, 1927. The irresponsible Bunker Sr. eventually disappeared from the strip. From then on, pint-sized Bunky (still dressed in the baby bonnet and gown in which he was first seen) was the star, protector, and benefactor of the family. His vocabulary rivaled that of any educated adult. Arch-nemesis Fagin, introduced in 1928, was as vile and despicable a villain as any Charles Dickens antagonist. He \\"would steal pennies from a blind man's cup and kick dogs that weren't even in his way. Robbing widows and orphans ... was routine for him\\", according to comics historian Don Markstein, who said the strip popularized the phrase, \\"Youse is a viper!\\"Bunky at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. from the original on April 13, 2012. Fantasy author and Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E. Howard, a big fan of Bunky, was fond of quoting from the strip, as noted by his friend, Tevis Clyde Smith.Smith, Tevis Clyde. Report on a Writing Man, Necronomicon Press, 1991. After DeBeck's death in 1942, Bunky continued for a time under Joe Musial (The Katzenjammer Kids) and Fred Lasswell. The series ended on July 18, 1948. =Other toppers= Other toppers featured above Barney Google included: Who's Who (1932), Youse Is a Viper (May 15, 1932 - Aug 19, 1934), I Learnt This Trick from the Prince (Aug 12-Sept 2, 1934), Knee-Hi-Knoodles (Sept 9, 1934 - June 23, 1935), Hill-Billy Ba-Looney (Sept 15-Dec 8, 1935), What Did the Doodle Bug Say? (April 11–25, 1937) and Write a Caption for This Cartoon (Sept 11-Oct 9, 1938). Fred Lasswell When Barney Google began to lose popularity during the Great Depression, DeBeck introduced a simpler style through artist Fred Lasswell after seeing a poster by Lasswell, then in high school, at a golf tournament at Palma Cia Country Club in Tampa, Florida. Lasswell, who drew cartoons and posters at the McCarthy Ad Agency and for the Tampa Daily Times, was brought in create the Snuffy characters, which by 1934, surpassed Barney Google in popularity. Lasswell took over the strip, now named Barney Google and Snuffy Smith after DeBeck died in 1942. In 1944 and 1945, Lasswell began featuring Snuffy in guest appearances in Laswell's own Sargent Hashmark comic strip that appeared in the U.S. Marines' Leatherneck Magazine. After the war, Lasswell gained steady increases in distribution, with the strip eventually appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers throughout the world. In 1962, Lasswell received the Silver Lady Award, and two years later won the Reuben Award and the Best Humor Strip Award from the National Cartoonist's Society.\\"NCS Awards\\", National Cartoonists Society. Retrieved June 1, 2019. In both 1984 and 1994, he won the Elzie Segar Award, being the only cartoonist who received this award more than once. Lasswell died in 2001, 16 weeks ahead on the strip, leaving a digital archive containing 35,000 original comic panels and sketches, including over 20,000 daily and 4,000 Sunday strips and about 24,000 original gags. John R. Rose In mid-1998, editorial cartoonist John R. Rose began as Lasswell's inking assistant, and he became the strip's cartoonist after Lasswell's death. In addition to being the artist on the strip, Rose is the editorial cartoonist for Ogden Newspapers of Virginia and creates Kids' Home Newspaper, a weekly syndicated puzzle feature for Creators Syndicate. His books including The Bodacious Best of Snuffy Smith (2013), Balls of Fire! More Snuffy Smith Comics (2016), and Snuffy Smith In His Sunday Best (2018). Rose restored Barney Google as a semiregular character; in 2015, Rose won with the Lum and Abner Memorial Award by the National Lum and Abner Society for his contributions to rural humor. In September 2017, Rose was honored with an award at Walt Disney's Hometown Toonfest in Marceline, Missouri, for his contributions to cartooning. John Rose was awarded First Place from the Tennessee Press Association in 2018 for Best Use Of Humor In An Ad for a series wildfire prevention public service newspaper ads featuring Snuffy Smith. He created these \\"Snuff Out Wildfires Before They Start\\" ads for the Knoxville News- Sentinel and the Tennessee Press Association after devastating wildfires hit eastern Tennessee. In June 2019, Rose featured Barney Google in a special 100th-birthday series that lasted several weeks. Barney got lost in the funny papers trying to find Hootin' Holler and ended up visiting Dagwood, Popeye, Beetle Bailey, and more on his way to a birthday party that featured many characters from Barney Google and Snuffy Smith who had not been seen in decades. And tribute panels to cartoonists Billy DeBeck and Fred Lasswell. Origin of \\"Google\\" Following \\"The Goo-Goo Song\\" (1900), the word \\"Google\\" was introduced in 1913 in Vincent Cartwright Vickers' The Google Book, a children's book about the Google and other fanciful creatures who live in Googleland: Aware of the word's appeal, DeBeck launched his comic strip six years later, and the \\"goo-goo-googly\\" lyrics in the 1923 song \\"Barney Google\\" focused attention on the novelty of the word. When mathematician and Columbia University professor Edward Kasner was challenged in the late 1930s to devise a name for a very large number, he asked his nine-year-old nephew, Milton Sirotta, to suggest a word. Sirotta suggested the word “googol”, and in 1940, Kasner introduced the words \\"googol\\" and \\"googolplex\\" in his book, Mathematics and the Imagination. Milton Sirotta died in 1980, but author Bunny Crumpacker has speculated that the boy might have been thinking of Google the comic character.Kasner, Edward and Newman, James. Mathematics and the Imagination, Simon & Schuster, 1940. This is the term that Larry Page and Sergey Brin had in mind when they named their company in 1998, but their fellow graduate student Sean Anderson misspelled \\"googol\\" as \\"google\\".David Koller (2004), “Origin of the name ‘Google’” In 2002, when Page set up a scanning device at Google to test how fast books could be scanned, the first book he scanned was Vickers' The Google Book.Levy, Steven. In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives, Simon & Schuster, 2011.Chambers Dictionary of Etymology Legacy DeBeck, who had a gift for coining colorful terms, is credited with introducing several Jazz Age slang words and phrases into the English language—including \\"sweet mama\\", \\"horsefeathers\\", \\"heebie-jeebies\\", \\"hotsy- totsy\\", and \\"Who has seen the doodle bug?\\" Snuffy's catchphrases \\"great balls o' fire\\" and \\"time's a-wastin'\\" remain popular to this day. In DeBeck's memory, the National Cartoonists Society in 1946 introduced the Billy DeBeck Award. (Eight years later, the name was changed to the Reuben Award after Rube Goldberg.) In 1963, Lasswell won both the NCS Humor Comic Strip Award and Reuben Award. That same year, he won the society's plaque for Best Humor Strip. In 1984, the society gave him its Elzie Segar Award (named after the creator of Popeye) for outstanding contributions to his profession. Snuffy Smith currently appears in 21 countries and 11 languages. In 1995, the strip was honored by the U.S. Postal Service; it was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative USPS postage stamps. Licensing Snuffy Smith makes a brief appearance in Clifford D. Simak's Out of Their Minds. =Toys and merchandise= Menu for planned Snuffy's Shanty hot dog shops Spark Plug captured the nation's hearts and imagination during the 1920s, and became a merchandising bonanza for King Features and Billy DeBeck. \\"Spark Plug, I am happy to say, has caught on,\\" wrote DeBeck in 1924. \\"All over the United States you find stuffed Spark Plugs and Spark Plug games and Spark Plug drums and Spark Plug balloons and Spark Plug tin pails. And there is a Spark Plug play on the road. The only thing that is lacking is a Spark Plug grand opera.\\" (Source: Barney Google and Snuffy Smith: 75 Years of an American Legend, page 35).

It is the oldest continuously operating all-male secret society in the country.

Dartmouth College: an architectural tour. 2008. Dance card from a dance hosted by The Sphinx in 1899. The senior members of the Sphinx continue to select a small number of male students of the junior class during Winter Carnival Weekend in a process known as \\"tapping.\\" Traditionally selecting 24 members per year, the delegation often is referred to as \\"twenty-fours\\" or the Krewe. The Sphinx originally published the names of its members in the annual Aegis, but the society has become more secretive in recent years. The identities of the members are now kept secret until Commencement, when graduating members carry identifying canes. The Sphinx Tomb, constructed in 1903 on East Wheelock Street, was designed by Manchester architect William M. Butterfield and reflects the Egyptian Revival architectural style popular during the mid-nineteenth century. In 1923, a significant addition was planned for the tomb; however, the proposed addition was never constructed. Instead, a smaller rear addition was constructed in 1926. The interior of the Sphinx was replaced after a fire started in the building's furnace destroyed it in 1929. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Many rumors surround the Sphinx. Some have believed that the tomb routinely has the highest water bill of any building in town because it contains a swimming pool, although town records do not substantiate this persistent rumor. Another rumor is that a passageway connects the Sphinx to the basement of Alpha Delta fraternity next door. The group's clandestine operations are rumored to include everything from providing anonymous community service to long ago stealing artwork from the College in a traditional scavenger hunt. The Sphinx attracted negative publicity in 1989, when thefts that took place during a scavenger hunt were traced back to the secret society. On April 27, 1989, 16 students took part in a scavenger hunt that resulted in the theft of numerous items across the Dartmouth campus, including paintings, photographs, mailboxes, life preservers, and signs. The school estimated the total value of missing items at nearly $12,000. The school announced that no questions would be asked if all items were returned undamaged, and within 24 hours most items were returned but several were still missing. The resulting investigation revealed that the Sphinx was responsible for the scavenger hunt, and Dartmouth revoked recognition of the Sphinx for one year, fined the organization $3,000 plus the cost of damages to the stolen items, and punished the members involved with probation or suspension. In 2003, an unsuccessful illegal break-in was attempted by two unidentified males.

It is a measure of the revenue generated by one customer phone, pager, etc., per unit time, typically per year or month. In mobile telephony, ARPU includes not only the revenues billed to the customer each month for usage but also the revenue generated from incoming calls, payable within the regulatory interconnection regime.

Variations in ARPU reflect changes in the companies' ability to generate revenue and heavily impact their stock prices.https://adexchanger.com/platforms/facebook-made-almost-20-average- revenue-per-user-q4-big-jump/ That provides the company a granular view at a per user or unit basis and allows it to track revenue sources and growth. There is a trend by telecommunications and Internet companies and their suppliers to sell extra services to users and a lot of the promotion that is used by the companies talks of increased ARPU for the operators. It typically manifests in the form of value-added services such as entertainment being sold to customers especially in markets where the primary service offered to the customer, such as the telephony or Internet service, is sold at a commodity rate.  Calculation  To calculate ARPU, a standard time period must be defined. Most telecommunications carriers operate by the month. The total revenue generated by all units (paying subscribers or communications devices) during that period is determined. Then that figure is divided by the number of units. Because the number of units can vary from day to day, the average number of units must be calculated or estimated for a given month to obtain the most accurate possible ARPU figure for that month. Also related is the ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User), which is calculated by dividing up the revenue amongst the users who paid anything at all. That yields a figure that is significantly larger than ARPU. For example, in the case of a subscription game that has a free to play version, the ARPPU, measured by accounts, is the subscription price, diluted slightly by free trials. A related measure is the ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User). Other common measure is ARPC (Average Revenue Per Customer), some customers generate higher revenue than other because these customer contract more telecommunications services or generate more use than other customers and so these customer have a higher ARPC, than others customers for the same telecommunication company. Average margin per user (AMPU) is another criterion for measuring the success of telephone companies. The central premise is that by attention to the margin produced per sold unit, not the amount of cash (revenue) earned from each customer, one can afford low volumes and still have a healthy company. High volumes can also bring a significant edge until competition forces prices down. Telecom analysts is traditionally\\"Forget the Revenues - Focus on Margins\\", MobileIN, April 4, 2005 highly focused on ARPU because the typical telco has had huge infrastructure costs that needs to be serviced by a considerable ARPU. Another use of \\"AMPU\\" in some telephone companies (in particular Telenor) is Average Minutes Per User, meaning the amount of time (measured in minutes) the average subscriber talks (or listens) in their phones. That is also called Minutes-Of-Use or MOU. ARPU is widely used by Internet Protocol television (IPTV) service providers.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York and worked during his lifetime as an artist, graphic designer and model maker. Just before 1950, he designed and produced a first generation set of plastic face pieces. The push pin shaped noses, ears, eyes, and mouth parts could be pushed into fruits or vegetables to transform the food into playmates. The toy did not take off at first because post-World War II consumers didn't like the idea of wasting food by playing with it. Lerner finally sold the toy for $5,000, to a cereal company. The toys were planned to be a premium giveaway in cereal boxes. But when Lerner found a better deal offered by toy manufacturer Hassenfeld Brothers (now Hasbro), Lerner and the manufacturer bought the rights back for $7000. HasBro officially named the toy, Mr. Potato Head. In 1964 and 1975 George Lerner's original designs got their plastic head and size upgrades respectively, in order to comply with government issued safety regulations. Lerner was also an inventor and made furniture and other toys. Lerner died in 1995.

The novel was originally published under the title The Wild Palms, which is the title of one of the two interwoven stories. This title was chosen by the publishers, Random House, over the objections of Faulkner's choice of a title. Subsequent editions have since been printed under the title If I Forget Thee Jerusalem (1990, following the \\"corrected text\\" and format of Noel Polk), and since 2003 it is now usually referred to by both names, with the newer title following the historically first published title and in brackets, to avoid confusion: The Wild Palms [If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem]. Wild Palms/Old Man is a blend of two stories, a love story and a river story, entitled \\"Wild Palms\\" and \\"Old Man\\", respectively. Both stories tell us of a distinct relationship between a man and a woman. The novel starts with the first chapter, \\"Wild Palms\\", and continues, alternating the two stories chapter by chapter, until ending with the final chapter, \\"Old Man\\". In an interesting example of literary tribute, Jorge Luis Borges translated the complete novel into Spanish as Las palmeras salvajes (1940), a work that influenced a good number of American novelists. The Wild Palms is quoted in Jean-Luc Godard's 1959 film, Breathless (\\"À bout de souffle\\"), when Patricia claims to prefer to take \\"grief rather than nothing\\"; the same quote is cited in the 1986 John Hughes comedy Ferris Bueller's Day Off, when Principal Rooney \\"consoles\\" Sloan while waiting in front of the school. It also appears in the movie Im Lauf der Zeit, 1976, by Wim Wenders in which one of the protagonists, a truckdriver, is reading his paperback copy of the book every now and then. Agnès Varda says in her film The Beaches of Agnès that the structure of Faulkner's novel directly inspired her first feature, La Pointe Courte. Like four other Faulkner novels (Soldiers' Pay, Mosquitoes, Pylon and A Fable), the novel is not set in Yoknapatawpha County. Plot Each story is five chapters long and they offer a significant interplay between narrative plots. \\"Wild Palms\\" tells the story of Harry and Charlotte, who meet, fall in forbidden love, travel the country together for work, and, ultimately, experience tragedy when the abortion Harry performs on Charlotte kills her. \\"Old Man\\" is the story of a convict who, while being forced to help victims of a flood, rescues a pregnant woman. They are swept away downstream by the flooding Mississippi, and she gives birth to a baby. He eventually gets both himself and the woman to safety and then turns himself in, returning to prison.

Born in what is now Moorefield, West Virginia (which was then in the colony of Virginia), Zane established the settlement known as Fort Henry in Wheeling, Virginia (present-day West Virginia), on the Ohio River. Zane is also famous for blazing the trail known as Zane's Trace. He died of jaundice in 1811.  Family  Ebenezer Zane was one of six children born to William Andrew Zane and his wife, Nancy Ann Nolan. He had four brothers: Silas (born 1745), Andrew (born 1749), Jonathan (born about 1750), and Isaac (born 1753), as well as one sister, Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" (born 1759). Ebenezer Zane married Elizabeth McColloch (October 30, 1748 – 1814). Their first child was daughter Catherine (born June 27, 1769), who married Absalom Martin, a government surveyor of the Seven Ranges who founded Martins Ferry, Ohio. Sarah (born February 23, 1773) married John McIntire, later founder of Zanesville, Ohio, and helped write the first Ohio Constitution. Noah was born October 25, 1778. Rebecca (born October 10, 1776) was married to John Clarke. Hester, or Esther (born October 8, 1786) was married to Elijah Woods, who also helped write the Ohio Constitution. Daniel was born October 25, 1788, Jesse, October 5, 1790, John April 30, 1780, and Samuel born May 12, 1782. Jesse and John died young. He was a maternal ancestor of author Zane Grey, who was born in Zanesville.  At Fort Henry  Zane headed west with his brothers Silas and Jonathan Zane from Moorefield and established Fort Henry in 1769. During the American Revolutionary War, Zane and his brothers defended Fort Henry against two Native American attacks. The first Siege of Fort Henry occurred in September 1777. Zane's sister Elizabeth was celebrated for her courage during the second siege in September 1782 when she left the fort to retrieve a badly needed keg of gunpowder and sprinted back safely under a hail of gunfire. Ebenezer Zane began his military career under British rule. He served as a disbursing officer under Lord Dunmore. Zane later became a colonel in the Virginia colonial militia. In 1788, he served as a western delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention and voted in favor of ratification of the United States Constitution.  Building Zane's Trace  Zanesfield Following the war in 1796, Zane obtained permission and funds from the United States Congress to build a road through the Northwest Territory. In exchange for his work, Congress granted Zane tracts of land in the areas where the road intersected the Muskingum, Hocking, and Scioto rivers. When Zane's Trace was completed, it crossed what is now the state of Ohio from Wheeling, Virginia, to Maysville, Kentucky. Although the road was a rudimentary path and at first suitable only for travel by foot or horseback (not by wagon), the state of Ohio undertook improvements in the early 19th century. It was the only major road in Ohio until the War of 1812. Legacy Zanesville, Ohio, was named in his honor.

Biography Leah Rabin was born Leah Schloßberg in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia), to an upper-middle-class family of Russian- born parents. Immediately after Adolf Hitler's election as Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Schloßberg emigrated with her family to Mandate Palestine. Her father had bought a piece of property near Binyamina on his first trip to the area in 1927.Rabin 1997, pp. 42–45. She met her future husband, Yitzhak Rabin, at school. They married in 1948, the year of Israel's independence. Yitzhak became Prime Minister in 1974 following Golda Meir's resignation, but in 1977 a US Dollar bank account (illegal at that time in Israel) held by Leah was exposed by Haaretz journalist Dan Margalit. As a result, her husband decided to take responsibility, resigned from office. This came to be known as the Dollar Account affair. Rabin supported the peace efforts of her husband in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and worked further for a solution after his assassination. She wrote a book about her memories of her husband, which was released in 1997, under the name Rabin: Our Life, His Legacy.

There were long severe labour shortages on the Canadian prairies and these became extreme during the weeks of the fall harvest when millions of acres of crops needed to be brought in during a short period of time from September to October. Thus in 1890 harvest excursions were organized by the Canadian Pacific Railway in which special trains would transport workers from Eastern Canada to the prairie centres. There they be hired by agents and travel to farms across the prairies. The labourers were given low fares by the CPR as the railway knew that they would later earn a great deal from transporting the harvest. The CPR was also the largest landholder in the west and it hoped that some of the excursioners would decide to settle in the west and buy some railway land. The bulk of the labourers came from Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes but as demand increased workers began to be pulled from British Columbia, the United States, and Great Britain. Wages were high, the highest a labourer could earn in Canada. A seasons work could pull in up to three hundred dollars. As room and board were normally provided the only expense was the thirty to forty dollars for the train trip west. While wages were high conditions were poor. The trains that carried the workers were crowded and unsanitary, with few stops on the way. There was rarely enough accommodation for the workers in the west and many were forced into crowded, substandard housing. In years with a poor harvest too many people could be brought west and some would find themselves out of work. In 1928 a mass of thousands of British workers who could not find work threatened to become violent and were shipped back across the Atlantic at government expense. For the western towns the annual arrival of the raucous excursioners was a major disruption with violence, drunkenness and theft common. During the First World War the need for labour in the west was even more pressing as thousands of young men had enlisted. An extended campaign drawing on patriotism saw an unprecedented number travel west. The excursion peaked in the mid-1920s with over 50,000 workers a season travelling west. By the late 1920s the development of the combine harvester and other equipment dramatically cut the need for labour. The onset of the Great Depression ended the practice completely as high excess production and unemployment affected the prairies.

At , it is the second-highest peak in Windsor County. (The highest peak in the county is Gillespie Peak in the Joseph Battell Wilderness.) Mount Ascutney is a monadnock that rises abruptly from the surrounding lowlands. For example, the Windsor Trail is to the summit with of elevation gain and an overall 18% grade. Particularly noteworthy are the mountain's granite outcrops, one of which, near the summit, serves as a launching point for hang-gliders. While the name \\"Ascutney\\" was originally thought to come from the Abenaki word Ascutegnik, which was the name of a settlement near where the Sugar River meets the Connecticut River, it was later determined that the name actually has no meaning. The Abenaki name for the mountain is Kaskadenak (pronounced: Cas-Cad-Nac), which means \\"mountain of the rocky summit\\" or \\"wide mountain\\". In July 2018, the State of Vermont Board of Libraries, which has the state's mountain naming authority, heard arguments to officially rename the mountain to Mount Kaskadenak. The renaming had strong support from the indigenous tribes. The board voted 5–0 to reject the name change citing local opposition from residents. The mountain's base straddles several villages — Ascutney, Brownsville, Windsor, and West Windsor — and it is located only several miles off exit 8 on Interstate 91 in Mount Ascutney State Park. The mountain itself is visible from the top of Mount Washington, seventy miles away.  Location and description  Mt. Ascutney is located in the southeastern section of Windsor County, in the Connecticut River Valley. The village of Ascutney, in the town of Weathersfield, is to the south. To the north lie the towns of Windsor and West Windsor. The village of Brownsville, in the town of West Windsor, sits at the northwestern base of the mountain. To the east lies the Connecticut River and the city of Claremont, New Hampshire. To the immediate west stands another, smaller mountain, fittingly named Little Ascutney Mountain.  Viewing the mountain  Vermont Route 131 follows the south face of the mountain, and provides some good views of Ascutney. Similarly, Vermont Routes 44 and 44-A follow the north face, and provide a number of views of that side of the mountain. The north-south route of Interstate 91 runs just east of the mountain and provides extensive views of both the north and south faces. New Hampshire Routes 12 and 12-A provide good views of the east face. Viewing of the west face is difficult, due to the presence, immediately to the west, of Little Ascutney Mountain. At longer distance, the mountain is visible from many locations quite a few miles away, particularly hilltops and other mountains. Ascutney can be viewed from select locations on the Dartmouth College campus, among them the upper floors of Rauner Library and the Steele Chemistry Building. = Cornish Colony = From the late 1880s to 1930, a community of artists thrived in Cornish and Plainfield, New Hampshire as well as Windsor, Vermont. Besides Augustus Saint-Gaudens, other artists built their homes specifically sited towards the mountain, and it became the focal point of many expansive gardens and Italianate villas. Maxfield Parrish, Charles Platt, Thomas Dewing, and Winston Churchill (the writer) all built homes to view the mountain. Many of these houses remain, view intact, and the estate Augustus Saint Gaudens is now a national park, with, of course, a lovely view.  Geology  Mount Ascutney is part of the White Mountain plutonic-volcanic series of igneous rocks. These rocks intruded from Triassic to Cretaceous time in southern Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont with the relatively young Ascutney pluton intruding at ~122 MA (K/Ar date on Biotite). The Ascutney pluton is about 8 km × 4 km in map area and intrudes Precambrian basement gneisses of the Chester dome and overlying Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks. The pluton emplacement is probably related to the formation of transform faults and/or fracture zones during (failed) Mesozoic rifting.Ballard, R.D. and Uchupi, E. (1975) Triassic rift structure in the Gulf of Maine. American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin 59, 7, 1041-1072Foland, K.A. and Faul, H. (1977) Ages of the White Mountain intrusives-New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, USA. American Journal of Sciences, 277 888-904. The petrology of the pluton consists of three stocks which are gabbro-diorite, syenite and granite. There is also a partial ring dike and number of other dikes in the area.Schneiderman, J S. (1991) Petrolog and mineral chemistry of the Ascutney Mountain igneous complex. American Mineralogist, Vol 76 p 218-229 The last glacier broke material off the mountain and distributed it southward into Massachusetts. The trail it left is known as the \\"Mount Ascutney Train.\\"  Hang gliding  Mount Ascutney is a hang gliding site in New England. Notable for its excellent soaring, it is not unusual for hang gliders to fly from Mt. Ascutney to nearby states. Some trips can stretch to the New Hampshire or Massachusetts coastline, a flight of over 90 miles. Bronson Farm Actor Charles Bronson owned a farm near the mountain he and his wife named Zuleika, after their daughter. His remains were buried at Brownsville Cemetery in West Windsor, near the foot of the mountain, after his 2003 death.  Wildlife  Wild turkeys, deer, porcupines, and a wide variety of birds are commonly seen on Mt. Ascutney. The mountain is a favorite area for viewing migrating birds, which use the Connecticut River as a navigation pathway. More rarely seen wildlife includes moose, black bears, bobcats and fishers.  Hiking trails  The mountain features four principal hiking trails, three of which are named for the town from which that trail originates: * The Weathersfield Trail — The one trail on the south face of the mountain, the base of this trail is located in a parking lot at the end of Cascade Falls Rd, off of Vermont Route 131 in Weathersfield. Highlights of this trail include Cascade Falls, the largest waterfall on the mountain, and the mountain's one launch platform for hang gliders. * The Windsor Trail — This trail originates from a small parking area off Vermont Route 44-A just east of the junction with Vermont Route 44. About 1/3 of the way up, the trail comes to a small waterfall, approximately 2/3 of the way up the trail comes to a small log lean-to shelter. Near the top, it merges with the Brownsville Trail. * The Brownsville Trail — This trail begins at a parking area along Vermont Route 44, a little over a mile west of junction with Vermont Route 44-A. The lower end of the trail follows an abandoned logging road for some distance — the road terminating at the location of an old granite quarry. The trail offers many good viewing opportunities to the north and west. * The Futures Trail — This trail begins in the campground at Mt. Ascutney State Park on Route 44A, one mile west of the junction with U.S. Route 5 in Ascutney. This is the longest trail on Mt. Ascutney — 4.6 miles, covering a wide variety of forest and geography before it connects to the Windsor Trail near the summit. Highlights of this trail include Bare Rock Vista (1.0 mile) and the Steam Donkey — a steam powered machine used for cable logging in the early 1900s (3.5 miles). This trail can also be accessed at two points along the State Park Mountain Road for a shorter hike to summit. At the top, a relatively level trail follows the ridgeline and crosses the summit. The top of the mountain is well below the tree line and is therefore covered in forest. There are a number of rocky cliffs allow good viewing, one lookout in particular The Nowlan Lookout is named for a local American sculptor Lawrence Nowlan. There is an observation tower, as well. There are also two large communications towers. The summit can also be reached via a short trail from the parking lot at the end of the only road up the mountain, the Mt. Ascutney State Park Mountain Road.  Skiing and the Ascutney Mountain Resort  aerial view of Mount Ascutney Mt. Ascutney was home to the Ascutney Mountain Resort, which was a ski resort located on the mountain's northwest face, in the village of Brownsville. Opening after the end of World War II, skiing facilities originally consisted of just one rope tow. The resort property was purchased by IHG Resorts in 2008 andcontinues to renovate and improve the property. The mountain and trails were purchased by a non-profit organization Vermont Outdoors and is now operated as town forest for Brownsville Vermont. The trails accommodate the entire family, but expert and intermediate skiers found themselves most at home at the resort, whose trails averaged from medium grade to steep, and were often icy from the mountain's often harsh winds. The ski resort's primary competitors were Killington, Okemo, Mount Sunapee, and Stratton.

Mitchill. - Biodiversity Heritage Library Retrieved October 7, 2014. Early life Samuel Mitchill was born in Hempstead in the Province of New York, the son of Robert Mitchill and his wife, Mary Latham, both Quakers. He was sent to Scotland and graduated in 1786 from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with an M.D., his education being paid for by a wealthy uncle.D. Graham Burnett, Trying Leviathan: The Nineteenth-Century New York Court Case That Put the Whale on Trial and Challenged the Order of Nature (Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 45. Returning to the United States after medical school, Mitchill also completed law school. As a lawyer, he oversaw the purchase of lands in western New York from the Iroquois Indians in 1788. Career Mitchill taught chemistry, botany, and natural history at Columbia College from 1792 to 1801 and was a founding editor of The Medical Repository, the first medical journal in the United States. In 1793, he was elected a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Gregory, Dugald Stewart, and John Rotherham. In addition to his Columbia lectures on botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Mitchill collected, identified, and classified many plants and animals, particularly aquatic organisms. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1797. From 1807 to 1826, he taught at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York and then helped organize the short-lived Rutgers Medical College of New Jersey, which he served as vice president until 1830. While at Columbia, Mitchill developed a fallacious theory of disease; however, it resulted in his promotion of personal hygiene and improved sanitation.Keir B. Sterling, \\"Mitchill, Samuel Latham\\" American National Biography Online. Mitchill served in the New York State Assembly in 1791 and again in 1798 and was then elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1801 until his resignation on November 22, 1804. In November 1804, Mitchill was elected a U.S. Senator from New York to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Armstrong, and served from November 23, 1804, to March 4, 1809. He then served again in the House of Representatives from December 4, 1810, to March 4, 1813. Mitchill was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory On January 29, 1817, Mitchill convened the first meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences, originally called the Lyceum of Natural History, of which he was later elected President. Mitchill strongly endorsed the building of the Erie Canal, sponsored by his friend and political ally DeWitt Clinton; they were both members of the short-lived New-York Institution.See Mitchill's speech at the dedication of the Erie Canal . Mitchill suggested renaming the United States of America Fredonia, combining the English \\"freedom\\" with a Latinate ending. Although the suggestion was not seriously considered, some towns adopted the name, including Fredonia, New York.George R. Stewart, Names on the Land (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1967) 173. Some freebooters even established a short-lived republic under that name in Texas in the late 1820s. Personality Mitchill was a man of \\"irrepressible energies... polyglot enthusiasms... [and] distinguished eccentricities\\" who was not \\"a man afraid to speak out loud about the loves of plants and animals; indeed, he was not a man afraid to speak out loud on most any topic. In the early nineteenth century, Mitchill was New York's \\"most publicly universal gentleman... a man known variously as the 'living encyclopedia,' as a 'stalking library,' and (to his admired Jefferson) as the 'Congressional Dictionary.'\\"Burnett, 44. In 1828, Martin Harris, an associate of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, visited Mitchill to ask him to authenticate the \\"Reformed Egyptian\\" characters that Smith said were taken from golden plates to which he said he had been directed by an angel. Mitchill would have been unsympathetic to the view that Indians were related to the Jews or the Egyptians because he was one of the few scholars of his day who believed that Native Americans were descended from Asians. Mitchill left no record of Harris's visit.; ; . \\"Once described as a 'chaos of knowledge,' Mitchill was generally more admired for his encyclopedic breadth of understanding than for much originality of thought.\\" As a personality, he was affable but also egotistical and pedantic. Mitchill enjoyed popularizing scientific knowledge and promoting practical applications of scientific inquiry.  Published Works  * Mitchill, S. L. 1818. Description of three species of fish.

The plot follows two angels (Hunter and Lindo) who are sent to Earth to help make a disgruntled kidnapper (McGregor) and his hostage (Diaz) fall in love. The film received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office, only grossing $14.6 million worldwide against its $12 million budget. Plot In Heaven, angels are tasked with ensuring that mortals on Earth find love. The \\"Captain\\", Gabriel, is upset at reviewing the file of angel partners O'Reilly and Jackson, all of whose recent cases have ended in divorce or misery. Gabriel is being pressed for results, so he introduces a radical new incentive: if their latest case isn't \\"cracked\\" – meaning, if the pair in question do not fall, and stay, in love, O'Reilly and Jackson must stay on earth forever, which does not appeal to them. They open their case file to learn their tasks. Celine Naville is the spoiled twenty-something daughter of a wealthy businessman. When one of her suitors, a loathsome dentist named Elliott, proposes marriage to her, she offers to say yes, but only if he agrees to reenact \\"William Tell\\" with an apple on his head. As she takes aim with a pistol, Elliot's nerves fail; his move results in a minor head wound. Robert Lewis is a janitor employed in the basement of Celine's father's company. His dreams for writing a best-selling trash novel are shot down by his co-workers. His manager tells him he is to be replaced by a robot. As he drowns his sorrows at a local bar, his girlfriend, Lily tells him she is leaving him for an aerobics instructor. O'Reilly and Jackson pose as collection agents to repossess Robert's things and evict him from his apartment. Robert storms to the high-rise office of the company boss, Mr Naville, while Naville is berating his daughter Celine for the William Tell fiasco. Security guards run in and start to attack Robert but he holds them off. When Celine introduces herself, Robert decides to kidnap her. He drives her to a remote cabin in the California woods. Celine easily slips free but decides to stick around. She stays for the adventure and revenge against her father, suggesting that they extort a huge ransom. O'Reilly and Jackson pose as bounty hunters, and contract with Naville to retrieve Celine and kill Robert. Robert's first attempt to collect the ransom fails but Celine encourages him. They go out to a rustic bar, where they sing along to the karaoke machine. When Robert wakes up the next morning, he is stunned to see that he and Celine have slept together. Robert makes a second demand for the ransom, with a letter written in Celine's blood. Naville gives O'Reilly and Jackson the money, and they go to meet Robert in the forest. To their disappointment, Robert appears willing to let Celine go in exchange for the money before O'Reilly stops his getaway. Aside, Jackson confesses his fears that the two are not in love yet. O'Reilly responds, \\"Jeopardy, Jackson. Always works.\\" While O'Reilly and Celine wait by their car, Jackson takes Robert into the woods to execute him. Before he can, Celine decks O'Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel. As Robert and Celine drive away, O'Reilly grabs the towbar and rides along. As she points her gun, Robert and Celine jump from the car, and it careens off a cliff, with the money still inside. Since they are short of money, Celine decides to rob a bank with Jackson's pistol. The robbery goes smoothly, until a security guard shoots at Celine. Robert pushes her out of the way, taking a bullet in the thigh. Celine hurriedly drives him back to the city, to be operated on by Elliot (the closest thing she can find to a discreet medical specialist). A little later, when Robert regains consciousness, he is appalled to see Celine playing a sleazy sexual role-playing game with Elliott. A fight breaks out, and Robert knocks Elliott unconscious. As they drive away, Celine explains that she only agreed to Elliott's request so that he would help Robert – and, in any case, it's none of Robert's business, since he and Celine aren't \\"involved,\\" whatever he might think. Hurt, Robert gets out of the car and walks away. To get them back together, Jackson writes a love poem in Robert's handwriting and sends it to Celine. Overcome, she runs back to the bar, where Robert has started working as a janitor, and says he has won her heart with the poem. O'Reilly and Jackson, listening, dance for joy... until Robert says that he's never written a poem in his life. Humiliated, Celine runs out again. But after she's gone, Robert's boss, Al, knocks some sense into him: Robert has nothing in his life except the improbable love of \\"an intelligent, passionate, beautiful, rich woman... so why are you even thinking about it?\\" Robert runs after Celine, but is too late: O'Reilly and Jackson, believing they have failed, decide to make their Earth-bound lives bearable by kidnapping Celine for ransom. Robert tracks Celine to their hideout. He knocks O'Reilly down and, struggling with Jackson, tells Celine he loves her. The door is kicked down by Naville's butler, Mayhew, who shoots the two angels in the head (apparently killing them). Leaving Celine locked in the trunk, Naville and Mayhew drive Robert and the two angels' bodies to the cabin, planning to fake a murder-suicide. In Heaven, Gabriel's secretary begs him to intervene, but he refuses. He phones God and asks him to do so. A neighbour releases Celine from the truck. Taking his gun, she runs to the cabin and confronts her father, while Mayhew holds Robert at gunpoint. Robert has had recurring dreams of being saved by being shot through the heart by an \\"arrow of love.\\" Celine shoots Robert and the bullet passes through, to hit Mayhew in the shoulder. After a whispered conference in Al's bar, Robert and Celine walk outside to their wedding. In an epilogue, Gabriel frees O'Reilly and Jackson from a pair of body bags. After Gabriel congratulates them on a successful case, the two angels embrace as they prepare to return home. In a second epilogue, Robert and Celine retrieve the suitcase full of money and settle in their new castle in Scotland.

Reception = Critical response = A Life Less Ordinary has received mixed reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 41% based on 37 reviews, with an average score of 5.38/10. The sites critical consensus states \\"A Life Less Ordinary has an intriguing cast and stylish work from director Danny Boyle, but they're not enough to overcome the story's fatally misjudged tonal mishmash.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score in the 0–100 range based on reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 35% for the film, based on reviews from 22 critics. Andrew Johnson wrote in Time Out New York, \\"The outsiders' take on America that Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge bring to the film adds to its humour, as do subtle homages to other movies (including The Road Warrior, Reservoir Dogs and Raiders of the Lost Ark). Parts of Life lean toward the saccharine, and the ending could be stronger, but none of that prevents it from being one of the years' most charming date movies.\\" Roger Ebert gave A Life Less Ordinary a negative review, presenting it 2 out of 4 stars. He described the film as a \\"movie that never convinces us that it needed to be made.\\" He goes on to call the plot a mess and states that it \\"expends enormous energy to tell a story that is tedious and contrived.\\" =Box-office performance= The film opened up in theatres on 24 October 1997.

The town grew up around Chertsey Abbey, founded in 666 AD, and was awarded a market charter by Henry I. A bridge across the River Thames was first constructed in the early 15th century. The River Bourne runs through the town to meet the Thames at Weybridge. The Anglican church has a medieval tower and chancel roof. The 18th-century listed buildings include the current stone Chertsey Bridge and Botleys Mansion. A curfew bell, rung at 8 p.m. on weekdays from Michaelmas to Lady Day, is associated with the romantic local legend of Blanche Heriot, celebrated by a statue of the heroine and the bell at Chertsey Bridge. The green spaces include the Thames Path National Trail, Chertsey Meads and a round knoll (St Ann's Hill) with remains of a prehistoric hill fort known as Eldebury Hill. Pyrcroft House dates from the 18th century and Tara from the late 20th. Train services from Chertsey railway station to and from London Waterloo are operated by South Western Railway. The town is within the M25, which is accessible via junction 11. History =Etymology= The place appears in the endowment charter of its abbey in the 7th century as Cirotisege or Cerotesege, meaning the island of Cirotis. =History= folio 6r of a Breviary of Chertsey Abbey Chertsey Bridge is the Thames crossing showing the Georgian architecture of James Paine and 1930s lamps Chertsey was one of the oldest market towns in England. Its Church of England parish church dates to the 12th century (see below) and the farmhouse of the Hardwick in the elevated south-west is of 16th-century construction.Church of St Peter. Grade II* (mid- category) Hardwick (or Hardwick Court/Manor) Farmhouse. Grade II (initial category) It grew to all sides but the north around Chertsey Abbey, founded in 666 A.D by Eorcenwald, Bishop of London, using a donation by Frithwald. Until the end of use of the hundreds, used in the feudal system until the establishment of Rural Districts and Urban District Councils, the name chosen for the wider Chertsey area hundred was Godley Hundred. In the 9th century, the Abbey and town were sacked by the Danes, leaving a mark today in the name of the neighbouring village, Thorpe, and refounded as a subsidiary abbey from Abingdon Abbey by King Edgar in 964. Chertsey appears in the Domesday Book as Certesi. It was held partly by Chertsey Abbey and partly by Richard Sturmid from the abbey. Its Domesday assets were: 5 hides, 1 mill and 1 forge at the hall, 20 ploughs, 80 hectares of meadow, woodland worth 50 hogs. It rendered a larger than average sum for the book of manor and ecclesiastical parish entries, £22. The Abbey grew to become one of the largest Benedictine abbeys in England, supported by large fiefs in the northwest corner of Sussex and Surrey until it was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1536. The King took stone from the Abbey to construct his palace at Oatlands Palace; the villagers also used stone for raising the streets. By the late 17th century, only some outer walls of the Abbey remained. During this period until at least 1911 a wider area was included in Chertsey: Ottershaw (and Brox) was an ecclesiastical district; whose church-sponsored (first built) schools were built in 1870, so too was Addlestone. Today the history of the abbey is reflected in local place names and the surviving former fishponds that fill with water after heavy rain. The nearby Hardwick Court Farm, now much reduced in size and cut off from the town by the M25, has the successor to the abbey's large and well-supported 15th- century tithe barn, mostly rebuilt in the 17th century. The eighteenth-century Chertsey Bridge provides an important cross-river link, and Chertsey Lock is a short distance above it on the opposite side. On the south west corner of the bridge is a bronze statue of local heroine Blanche Heriot striking the bell by Sheila MitchellFRBS. The summit of St Ann's Hill in Chertsey was a vital viewing point for the Anglo-French Survey, which calculated the distance between the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory using trigonometry. A grid of triangles was measured all the way to the French coast, to join up with the French survey; St Ann's Hill was crucial for the link with the base-line of the English survey on Hounslow Heath. In the 18th century, Chertsey Cricket Club was one of the strongest in the countryHistory of Chertsey Cricket Club and beat the rest of England (excluding Hampshire) by more than an innings in 1778. The Duke of Dorset, (who played cricket for Chertsey), was appointed Ambassador to France in 1784. He arranged to have the Chertsey cricket team travel to France in 1789 to introduce cricket to the French nobility. However, the team, on arriving at Dover, met the Ambassador returning from France at the outset of the French Revolution and the opportunity was missed. The original Chertsey railway station was built by the London and Southampton Railway and opened on 14 February 1848. The present station, across the level crossing from the site of the original one, was opened on 10 October 1866 by the London and South Western Railway.Details from Chertsey Station one of the many Grade II listed buildings: The Southern Railway completed electrification of the line on 3 January 1937. Samuel Lewis devotes one of his longest entries to the small town in his 1848 topographical guide to England: Chertsey Regatta has been held on the river for over 150 years,The Skiff Club, traditional boating club (using skiffs) who organise Chertsey Regatta which is in the non-Olympic regional sport of skiffing which has a club on this reach of river. Similarly the Olympic sport of rowing (in racing shells) has an annual Burway Regatta above Chertsey Lock, an area of former flood meadow, reservoirs and golf course. The Burway was in the medieval period let out by the Abbey as over of grazing pasture (and remains postally associated with the town). The Burway faces Laleham Park, the largest municipal park of a neighbouring borough. Chertsey was the home of Charles James Fox, who had wished to be buried there but instead is buried in Westminster Abbey. The nearby estate that is now the large Foxhills Golf Estate, Spa and Restaurant, close to Ottershaw and Lyne, was named in honour of him, but was not his home. A long history of metal working exists, and from the 19th century a prosperous bell foundry, Eldridge, was in Windsor Street. Herrings, an iron foundry, flourished during the 19th century and was situated in Gogmore Lane. The Chertsey troop of the Berkshire Yeomanry occupied the Drill Hall on Drill Hall Road since 1977. The unit has close ties with the borough and was granted the freedom of Runnymede in 2009. The Drill Hall closed at the end of March 2010 and the troop had to return to Windsor due to cuts in the Territorial Army in 2009–2010. Geography Simple road and watercourse map of the urban and suburban majority of Chertsey, which continues on postal, ecclesiastical parochial and ward definitions to the north and to the south-west. Chertsey is part of the London commuter belt in the outermost part of the Greater London Urban Area and is served by Chertsey railway station and separated from all adjoining settlements by the buffer of designated areas of Green Belt. Measuring from centre to centre, Chertsey is from London, from Addlestone, and from the county town, Guildford. The traditional, yet commercially important town centre is a conservation area, joined by an arcade to a medium-sized supermarket and car park to the south. The character of this central area is that of a traditional small town, with relatively narrow building frontages set hard up against the pavement, so that they clearly define the public space. The centre of the town is richly endowed with listed buildings most of which date from the 16th and 17th Centuries. In addition to the more than 56 numbered houses/shops (42 buildings) nationally listed buildings, nine other buildings in the conservation area are locally listed. A further 11 buildings outside the centre are also nationally listed. =Elevation and soil= Elevation is generally low at 14m in the Town Centre and 11 m on the River Thames at Chertsey Bridge, making it the lowest place in Chertsey. The highest point is on the peak of wooded and inhabited St. Ann's Hill which reaches an elevation of 77 m, making it the second-highest point in Runnymede. Across Chertsey bridge, pictured, on the Middlesex side of the river is the Thames Path National Trail and Chertsey Lock. Soil consists of four types: \\"loamy soil with naturally high groundwater\\" to the centre; \\"naturally wet loamy and clayey floodplain soil with naturally high groundwater\\" e.g. on the Laleham Burway and to the west and east of the most built-up central area of Chertsey; however to the far west and south areas such as St Ann's Hill and Hardwick Court Farm have \\"slightly acid loamy and clayey soil with impeded drainage\\" with highest parts being \\"naturally wet very acid sandy and loamy soil\\" which forms only 1.9% of English soil and 0.2% of Welsh soil and supports rich biodiversity and has been used to create the pine and bog landscapes of Wentworth and Foxhills, Chertsey.

Life Landor was the third son of Dr Walter Landor, a physician, and his wife Elizabeth Savage, and thereby the brother of Walter Savage Landor. He was born at Warwick and went to Bromsgrove School, then as a scholar, to Worcester College, Oxford in 1797. He became a Fellow of Worcester College and a clergyman. In 1815 Landor went to Italy and met his brother Walter and his wife as they made their temperamental journey through France. He became vicar of Hughenden Buckinghamshire in 1817 until 1825, and was also Chaplain in ordinary to the Prince Regent. He became Rector of Nafford in Birlingham in 1829 and remained there until his death. Birlingham is situated at the foot of the Bredan Hills and within sight of the Malverns. He is noted as never having been absent from Sunday Duty and the church at Birlingham was restored with money left by him. He was somewhat reluctant to claim credit for his own work. The drama The Count Arezzi of 1824 was at the time attributed to Byron and the story The Fawn of Sertorius (1846) to Walter Savage Landor. He is also said to have tried to destroy copies of the dramas The Earl of Brecon, Faiths Fraud and The Ferryman from 1841. It was said that he greatly resembled his eldest brother, Walter Savage Landor, in his genius and classical knowledge, but in nothing else. His cousin's daughter Lucy Landor recalled \\"Once only I recall his visiting my father and he then struck me as the most wonderful and delightful talker I ever heard. He spoke of his early travels in Italy and brought every scene before one. If he 'talked like a book', it was because his language was so beautiful and his descriptions so vivid and striking. His conversation made far more impression on me than did that of [his brother] W.S.L., whose tremendous laughs I recall much better than his saying.\\" Works *Guy's Porridge Pot (1808) *The Count Arezzi (1824) *The Impious Feast.

The university also has two other campuses in Muskogee and Broken Arrow as well as online. Northeastern is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of Oklahoma as well as one of the oldest institutions of higher learning west of the Mississippi River. Tahlequah is home to the capital of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and about 25 percent of the students at NSU identify themselves as American Indian.Agnew, Brad. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Northeastern State University.\\" The university has many courses focused on Native American linguistics, and offers Cherokee language Education as a major. Cherokee can be studied as a second language, and some classes are taught in Cherokee for first language speakers as well. History On May 7, 1851, the Cherokee Nation founded the Cherokee National Female Seminary at Tahlequah, the same year that it opened a male seminary in its territory. This was after its removal to Indian Territory and part of its building institutions to support its future. On March 6, 1909, after statehood, the State Legislature of Oklahoma passed an act providing for the creation and location of Northeastern State Normal School at Tahlequah, Oklahoma for the training of teachers. For this purpose, it purchased from the Cherokee Tribal Government the building, land, and equipment of the Cherokee Female Seminary. In 1921, the name was changed to Northeastern State Teachers College as it had expanded to a full four-year curriculum. In the 1950s Northeastern emerged as a comprehensive state college, broadening its curriculum at the baccalaureate level to encompass liberal arts subjects and adding a fifth-year program designed to prepare master teachers for elementary and secondary schools. With addition of graduate-degree programs, in 1974, the Oklahoma Legislature authorized changing the name of the institution from Northeastern State College to Northeastern Oklahoma State University; in 1985 it authorized a change in name to Northeastern State University. In 1979, NSU opened its College of Optometry, making it one of 14 schools in the United States to offer a doctorate degree in that field. In the early 21st century, NSU is the fourth-largest university in Oklahoma. On March 6, 2009, NSU celebrated its centennial with Founders Day celebrations. =Presidents= *Albert Sydney Wyly, 1909 *Frank Redd, 1909–1911 *Frank E. Buck, 1911–1912 *W.E.

It is one of the few choruses in the United States that has children singing alongside adults for every performance of its season (regardless of work or difficulty). Members of the chorus come from all over Rhode Island and southeastern Connecticut, with some members coming from as far as Bristol, Middlesex and Norfolk counties in Massachusetts. As part of its typical season, the chorus will present two \\"classical\\" concert series (one in November and one in May), a series of Christmas Pops concerts in December, seven performances of \\"A Celebration of Twelfth Night\\" in January (a musical and theatrical event based on an originally written stage play set in medieval times), a guest choral ensemble in February, an 'a cappella' concert series in March, and Summer Pops, a large outdoor performance held in Westerly's Wilcox Park for audiences of 25,000 each June. For its classical and pops events, the Chorus performs with professional orchestral musicians from the Boston Musicians Association and from across Rhode Island. Over its fifty-seven seasons, the Chorus of Westerly has performed many of the most important choral works ever written, from J.S. Bach's Mass in B Minor to William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast. In recent seasons, the chorus has performed Duruflé's Requiem, Mozart's Mass in C Minor, Vaughan Williams' Hodie, and Honegger's King David. The chorus has also given the American premiere performance of several British choral works of the past century. This list includes \\"Songs of the Fleet\\" by Charles Villiers Stanford, \\"Lux Aeterna\\" by William Mathias, \\"Birthday Madrigals\\" by John Rutter, \\"Mass of the Sea\\" by Paul Patterson and several other works of George Dyson, Patrick Hadley and Gilbert Vinters. In the summer months, the chorus holds a series of choral workshops, open to the public to participate, at Camp Ogontz in Lyman, NH. The sessions have been directed over the past two decades by Richard Marlow (former organist and choirmaster of Trinity College, Cambridge), Sir David Willcocks (former choirmaster of King's College, Cambridge and The Bach Choir, London), Herbert Bock, and most recently by David Hill (of the BBC Singers, the Bach Choir) and James Litton (former director of the American Boychoir). In August, a special workshop week of singing is held at Ogontz is specifically for the children and teenagers of the Chorus to help prepare them for the upcoming season of music. The chorus has toured five times internationally, including two tours to Great Britain, one tour to Italy, one tour to Hungary, Austria and the Czech Republic, and most recently, in Germany. As part of its tours, the chorus has performed in Westminster Abbey, King's College Chapel, Canterbury Cathedral, the cathedrals of Milan and Florence, Saint Mark's Basilica (Venice), Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican (including the singing of high mass), and performed the Dvořák Requiem with the Westminster Choir as part the closing concert of the 1987 Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds. The chorus toured Hungary, Austria, and the Czech Republic in July 2014, performing the Dvořák Stabat Mater. In 2017, the chorus toured Germany, performing Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B minor. Since 1969, the chorus has rehearsed and performed in what is now the George Kent Performance Hall (the former Immaculate Conception Church building of Westerly). The building (and its main nave/hall), renowned for its exceptional acoustics, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. From 1889 through 1969, Kent Hall was Westerly's Immaculate Conception Church. From the mid-1970s through 1990, the building was home to the Westerly Center for the Arts. When the Center for the Arts organization folded in 1991, the chorus purchased the building and renamed it the Chorus of Westerly Performance Hall. In September 2005, the chorus completed a $2.5 million renovation and expansion project on the facility thanks to the support of a community capital campaign. The facility was rededicated at that time as the George Kent Performance Hall. Summer Pops Westerly Since 1981, the Chorus of Westerly has presented and performed in one of Rhode Island's largest free outdoor music events, Summer Pops. Held in Westerly's Wilcox Park, an historic Victorian strolling park operated by the Westerly Public Library, the event annually attracts over 25,000 annual residents. The program features an hour- long pre-show event featuring local musicians and dancers followed by the main program featuring the entire Chorus, 55 members of the Pops Festival Orchestra, the Newport Artillery, church bells from the local Episcopal church, and a fireworks show by the Grucci Company of Long Island. Summer Pops was started as both a send off and thank you concert prior to the ensemble's 1981 concert tour to Great Britain. Because of its local popularity and early success, the Chorus of Westerly has continued to present the program at the start of summer (usually in late June) every year since 1981.http://www.thewesterlysun.com/entertainment/the-chorus-of-westerly- presents-summer-pops/article_702df1be-9ce7-11e0-86e6-001cc4c03286.html Leadership The Chorus of Westerly was founded in 1959 by George Kent.

The museum houses Mueller Planetarium, a hands-on science discovery center, and the Elephant Hall, where visitors can see the world's largest articulated fossil mammoth among the collection of fossil elephants. Also featured are interactive paleontology exhibits, a dinosaur gallery, ancient life and evolution exhibits, wildlife dioramas, gems and minerals, American Indian and African exhibits, and a temporary exhibit gallery featuring rotating displays on diverse topics including photography, quilts and fine arts.  History  290x290px The University of Nebraska State Museum was founded in 1871 by Erwin Barbour, the same year the University of Nebraska was established. The museums first home was two rooms located in Nebraska Hall. The first collections were recorded to be skeletons of a horse and a cow. In 1891, Erwin Barbour went on an expedition in search of fossils and minerals to contribute to the museum's empty cases. Barbour discovered a new fossil, Daimonelix. His contribution caught the attention of Charles Morrill in 1892. When Morrill learned Barbour's trip was not funded by the University, he donated $1,000 for the next expedition to keep the collections growing. Morrill continued to donate money to the museum throughout his life, which in turn allowed Barbour to send out over one hundred expeditions. Morrill Hall, the museums location since 1927, was dedicated to Charles Morrill for his contributions. The museum has three floors filled with exhibits. The first floor has a theme of Biodiversity and includes The Hall of Nebraska Wildlife, Darwin: A Life of Discovery, Dr Paul and Betty Marx Science Discovery Center, and an Educators Resource Center. The first floor has exhibits about Paleontology of Nebraska. Elephant Hall, Ralph Muller Planetarium, Bizarre Beasts, Toren Gallery of Ancient Life, Mesozoic Gallery, Fossil Animals, and a Discovery Shop are found on this floor. The third floor of the museum houses a variety of exhibits including Explore Evolution, Jurassic Dinosaurs, Rocks and Minerals, Weapons Throughout time, and First People of the Plains. Cooper Gallery, which displays temporary exhibits, is also found on the third floor.  Buildings  The University of Nebraska State Museum was first located in University Hall. Nebraska Hall was built in 1888 to make room for growing exhibits and enrollment in the University. In 1905, Charles Morrill wrote a letter expressing concerns with Nebraska Hall's structure and limited space. His proposal for a new building was granted. It was complete in 1908. The new building caught fire on March 6, 1912 causing major damage to the building and contents of the museum. The building was restored and served as the museum until 1927 when Morrill Hall was built. Morrill Hall was constructed based on the information gathered by Charles Morrill and Erwin Barbour's tour of museums in Europe in 1909. On May 28, 1927 Morrill Hall was dedicated to Charles Morrill for his contributions to the Museum.  Exhibits  = Paleontology of Nebraska = Mesozoic Gallery Located on the main floor of the museum, the Paleontology of Nebraska exhibits include the Elephant Hall, Mesozoic Gallery, Fossil Animals, Toren Gallery of Ancient Life. These exhibits display various fossil collections. The museum is known for its vast vertebrate paleontology collection, ranking 5th in the nation. The museum has been gathering its paleontology collections since 1891, when the Director Erwin Barbour began to excavate fossils from Western Nebraska. So far, more than 85,000 vertebrate species have been cataloged. Most of the collections originate from Nebraska. The collections from the Plaeistocene and Cretaceous are from New Mexico and Montana, respectively. The Elephant Hall is famous for having one of the largest mammoth skeletons in the world. Among them, the museum hosts the largest Columbian mammoth fossil in the world, known as \\"Archie.\\" It is also the state fossil of Nebraska. Along with the mammoth skeletons, the Hall displays skeletons and models of elephants of various eras. By comparing the structure of the skeletons and the elephants' teeth, visitors can learn about the evolutionary history of the elephants. The Mesozoic Gallery features skeletons and models of organisms that lived during the Mesozoic era. Along with the fossils of the dinosaurs, the Gallery is famous for its Plesiosaur fossil that was excavated in 2004 from Northeast Nebraska, which is known to be one of the longest marine fossil. The Toren Gallery of Ancient Life includes models of organisms of the Paleozoic era. The Fossil Animals section displays ancient and current skeletons of rhinos, horses, and camels. Recent donations to the museum are also shown in this area. = Tree of Life = Officially opened on February 22, 2013, the Tree of Life exhibit is a relatively recent addition to the museum. It was developed in partnership with Harvard University, Northwestern University, The University of Michigan, and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. This exhibit combines interactive touchscreen technology with a vast phylogenetic database to provide a fun educational experience for users of all ages. Museum visitors can browse an evolutionary tree showing the evolutionary relationships of more than 70,000 species over 3.5 billion years. It is often difficult to spur an interest in evolutionary concepts, especially in a museum. Since visitors can browse exhibits rather quickly, the Tree of Life exhibit is designed to hold the attention of users. Once a user is actively using the interactive technology, they are more likely to spend enough time to gain a substantial understanding of core ideas in evolutionary science. The University of Nebraska State Museum has incorporated the Tree of Life exhibit into some undergraduate biology courses. = Weapons Throughout Time = Weapons Throughout Time showcases a large collection of artifacts collected over the years. Officially opened in October 2009, it is one of the older exhibits in the museum. As the name suggests, the bulk of items in the collection were used as tools of survival and combat. Some pieces in the collection include stone arrowheads used by Native Americans in the Great Plains, Amazonian blow darts, Zulu hunting spears, Japanese and Samoan armor, and firearms from Asia, the Middle East, and the Western hemisphere. These artifacts give visitors insight into the culture of the people that created them, and the cultural differences are evident in the artistic design. Some items are over 9,000 years old. = Explore Evolution = The Explore Evolution exhibit was opened in September 2005. It was designed to educate the public about important evolutionary concepts using the work of several evolutionary scientists. The scientists whose work is included within the exhibit are: Charles Wood, Sherily Fritz and Edward Theriot, Cameron Currie, Kenneth Kaneshiro, Rosemary and Peter Grant, Svante Paabo and Henrik Kaessmann, and Philip Gingerich. This exhibit simplifies and reinforces the work of the scientists mentioned above using videos, models, and interactive components. Although it is designed to stimulate curiosity in young museum visitors, the Explore Evolution exhibit contains vast stores of information that will keep even the most educated evolutionary scientist interested. = Hall of Nebraska Wildlife = The Hall of Nebraska Wildlife exhibit offers a collection of wildlife dioramas that allow visitors to appreciate animals, birds, and plants from different Nebraskan regions. One component of this exhibit includes an installed modern Bison bison, a presumed descendant of the Nebraskan Ice Age Bison antiquus, an extinct species since 4,000–5,000 years ago. Additionally, in February 2008, the Nebraskan State Museum installed its first mountain lion provided by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission after it was struck and killed by traffic on Interstate 80. Chemical analysis of the mountain lion's claws suggests it had travelled from the Black Hills of South Dakota along the Missouri or Elkhorn Rivers. The exhibit also displays African animals that fall on the Red List of Threatened Animals, a compiled list of all threatened animals. A few shown animals include the Kobus ellipsiprymnus (Swimming Waterbuck), a medium-sized antelope that is at a \\"lower risk,\\" and the Diceros bicornis (Black Rhinoceros) who are now \\"critically endangered\\" due to overhunting.Planetarium Entrance = Mueller Planetarium = Mueller Planetarium was a gift to the university from Ralph S. Mueller, a Cleveland industrialist and inventor of the alligator clip. The planetarium was completed and dedicated in 1958, becoming the first planetarium in Nebraska. More than 20,000 people attended shows at the planetarium during its first six months of operation. Jack Dunn hosted the planetarium's first laser light show featuring electronic music using a car speaker surround system and two slide projectors in 1977. Visually impaired audiences brought to attention that it was difficult to see the stars projected during laser shows, and the Mueller Planetarium began working to improve the quality of the show. The \\"laser star show\\" developed specifically for the visually impaired became an official project of the International Laser Display Association (ILDA) in 1993, and the program was shared internationally with laser display companies. Through working with Hayden by ILDA of California, the show was optimized using a high-contrast dots and lines display to aid the visually impaired. Mueller Planetarium received a First Place Award for Outstanding Laser Display in November 1993. In 2006, Dunn intensified the light show by installing a full- dome system using spherical mirrors that project shows across the 30-foot-wide dome. As of 2016, the Mueller Planetarium still offers laser light shows along with informational shows depicting the solar system and Nebraskan night skies.  Community involvement  The University of Nebraska State Museum offers educational community events that allow a closer view of natural processes. The Planetarium offers informational shows that are geared towards younger ages, introducing children to the solar system, and shows that contain complex information understood more easily by adults. In addition, the University of Nebraska State Museum offers rotating hands-on activities for a range of younger ages. During the month of December 2016, an interactive \\"Augmented Reality Watershed Table\\" aims to promote freshwater ecosystem understanding and stewardship by allowing visitors to create topography models by shaping sand that is graphically projected from overhead and interacting with the \\"ecosystem\\" by stimulating water and rainfall. Also during December 2016, the University of Nebraska State Museum will hold \\"Sunday with a Junior Scientist,\\" where middle schoolers from Lincoln are able to present their science projects to museum visitors. The University of Nebraska State Museum is also involved in research pertaining to anthropology, botany, entomology, vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology, zoology, and parasitology. From 2007 to 2015, the State Museum partnered with biomedical researchers, artists, educators, writers, and youth to create a public campaign aimed at expanding diverse audiences' knowledge about microbes and infectious disease. Artists created comic strips that proved to be more student-interactive than standard textbooks, and through the Omaha Science Media Project, students and teachers were offered a two-week immersion experience at virology research labs at the Nebraska Center for Virology and the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Here, teachers and students researched viruses and were able to broadcast their laboratory experiences through collaboration with Nebraska Public Television, University of Nebraska School of Journalism, and Soundprint Media, Inc.

The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1450, making the Town of Strathaven a burgh of barony. The current estimated population is 7,500. Location The town is located on the edge of the strath of the Avon Water, around from Hamilton and from Glasgow. The A71, which connects Edinburgh and Kilmarnock passes through the town. In the 2001 census the town had a population of 7,700. Strathaven has one secondary school and three primary schools - Kirklandpark Primary, Wester Overton Primary, and St Patrick's Primary. It also has a grass airfield about to the north west on Lethame Road. History Detail of the advertisement on the town mill The Town Mill and Miller's house A Roman road passes close by, on the south side of the Avon Water, which led to the Roman fort at Loudoun Hill near Darvel. The origins of Strathaven Castle are obscure, but it is believed to have been built around 1350 by the Bairds, on a bend of the Powmillon Burn. Today it is a ruin, with a single tower and sections of wall remaining beside the A71. The Barony of Strathaven was acquired in 1362 by Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway, by his marriage to Joanna, daughter to Maurice de Moravia, 1st Earl of Strathearn, great Moray heiress. The settlement within the lands of Strathaven became a Burgh of barony in 1450. It still retains its traditional character despite the growth of more modern housing. The centre of the town is occupied by the market square, formerly a grassed common, and still known as Common Green, or just 'The Green'. Linking the town and the castle is the old 'Boo Backit Brig' ('bow-backed bridge'), a small arched bridge. The Old Parish Church, with its landmark spire, was built in 1772, and was the place of worship of the Duke of Hamilton who maintained a shooting lodge at nearby Dungavel House. The town prospered in the 18th and 19th centuries as a weaving town, although there were many merchants living here too. The town played a significant part in the Radical War of 1820, when James Wilson led a band of radicals on a march to Glasgow, to join a rumoured general uprising, which never actually happened. Wilson was hanged for treason, and in 1846 a memorial was built in his honour in the town cemetery. The history of Strathaven was documented in the John Hastie Museum, but this was closed in 2011 and was purchased by Andy Kerr, which went largely underpublicised given its historic significance and prominence near Strathaven Park. Its most famous 'modern' resident was Sir Harry Lauder (1870–1950) whose mansion, Lauder Ha', or Hall, was just above the town on the road to Kilmarnock. Sir Harry spent the Second World War years there, and died in February 1950. The family retained the property until Death Duties of 65% forced a sale in the late 1960s. It remains a private residence. Dungavel House on the outskirts of Strathaven was the location where German Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess originally intended to land on the evening of 10 May 1941 in a misguided attempt to seek peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton. However bad weather and poor navigation resulted in Hess having to land at Floors Farm in Eaglesham. In 2002, Strathaven was granted the title of Scotland's First Fairtrade Town (jointly with Aberfeldy) under the leadership of Paulo Quadros - chair of the first Fairtrade group in Scotland. Town centre Despite competition from the nearby large towns of East Kilbride and Hamilton, Strathaven still has a number of craft and gift shops, alongside well known town centre names. There is now only one bank, Halifax Bank of Scotland, with the Royal Bank of Scotland closing previously in 2018. The town's longest established business is Gebbie & Wilson, Solicitors in the Common Green, which was founded in 1816, closely followed by Alexander Taylor, Bakers in Waterside Street, established in 1820 and now run by the 5th generation of the Taylor family. There are a number of large businesses providing extra attraction to the town on its periphery such as Sainsbury's, Aldi and Greggs. It also has a number of small local business such as The Strathaven Hotel and The Rural Centre, both on Hamilton Road, it also has a number of local craft and charity shops too. The town has long been a Sunday Run territory with several town centre eating establishments as well as four public houses. Strathaven Academy Strathaven Academy is the town's only secondary school and in 2019 was voted the 18th best school in Scotland and top in South Lanarkshire. Following a major refurbishment the new building was completed in 2009 on the original site.  Strathaven railway stations  Strathaven North station in 1906 Strathaven had, at various times, three railway stations. * , the first station, was the terminus of the Hamilton and Strathaven Railway. The railway was taken over by the Caledonian Railway; and the station was replaced by . * , a terminal station on the Hamilton and Strathaven Branch of the Caledonian Railway, opened in October 1904, closed temporarily during World War I; and closed on 30 September 1945. * , on the Darvel and Strathaven Railway closed in June 1964 to services from the east, although the line to Darvel closed in 1939.  Strathaven Airfield  Strathaven Airfield is home to a microlight flying school, which operates both the traditional-style weightshift microlights and the light aircraft-style ones, and the new airfield manager's house was featured on Channel 4's Grand Designs in October 2013. There are approximately 35 aircraft - both light aircraft and microlights - hangared at Strathaven in two modern purpose-built hangars. The airfield is also home to an annual local music festival, HangarFest. The airfield was set up on the old Couplaw Farm, which The Scottish Flying Club Ltd bought in May 1964. The club had begun flying in 1927 at the old Renfrew AirportRenfrew Airport but was left homeless after Renfrew was nationalised in 1946. Strathaven Airfield was given to the RAF Benevolent Fund in 1974 and then sold privately in 2005. It has three grass runways, the main runway is oriented 09/27 and is 530m long (with a 100m starter extension on 27 available on request). The airfield co-ordinates in the UK Air Pilot ENR 5.5-17 are: 554049N 0040654W Religion Strathaven contains six churches including three Church of Scotland parishes: Avendale Old (built in 1772) linked with Drumclog Parish Church, Strathaven Rankin linked with Chapelton Parish Church, and East Parish Church (built in 1777) linked with Glassford Parish Church. The only Catholic Church in the town is St Patrick's Catholic Church (built in 1863). There is an active ecumenical body, consisting of six churches in the area (5 within the town, one nearby), named \\"Hope Strathaven\\", which work together bringing a mix of community projects that reflect faith and service. Sport Strathaven is home to several sports clubs, which include: * Strathaven Army Cadet Force * Strathaven Dynamo AFC * Strathaven Rugby Club * Strathaven Striders * Strathaven Golf Club * Strathaven Bowling Club * Avondale Bowling Club * Strathaven Tennis Club * Strathaven Badminton Club * Avon Angling Club * Upper Avon Angling Association Strathaven's Sport Centre underwent refurbishment in 2009 as a result of the demolition and reconstruction of Strathaven Academy. Sports facilities in Strathaven include a sports centre with indoor swimming pool and gym, three grass football pitches, one 3G joint football and rugby pitch, two grass rugby pitches, an 18 hole golf course, bowling club, four tennis courts, and several badminton courts in church and primary school halls.

It is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island. Built to the memory of Alexander Turney Stewart, the Cathedral of the Incarnation is the only cathedral in the United States funded by a single person, and the only one that is built in memory of a single individual. The cathedral is a product of Gothic Revival architecture. A view of the Cathedral of the Incarnation from the Bishop's Mansion in a snowstorm. The Cathedral is historically known for its music ministry, led by Canon Lawrence Tremsky (Northwestern University, M.M.). The Men & Boys Choir, which originated during the 19th century, was the reason that the train station in this area was initially constructed - to transport the boys from their homes in Brooklyn or Manhattan to rehearsals and services. During the 1930s, the Cathedral formed the first American cathedral girls' choir - known as the Schola Cantorum. The choirs sing a repertoire of choral music, from plainsong to modern works, selected carefully to coincide with the themes of the season. Evensong is sung on the first Sunday of each month in the traditional English cathedral model (Magnificat, Nunc Dimittis, an anthem, and Anglican Chant Psalms). Special seasonal liturgies include traditional \\"Lessons & Carols\\" one or two Sundays before Christmas.Canon Lawrence Tremsky (Director of Music) conducting the Cathedral Choirs in formal garb. The Cathedral is notable for its stained glass windows and icons. The Mural Ikon of Pantokrator, permanently installed at the Cathedral, was crafted by American iconographer Guillermo Esparza. A new organ was constructed by the firm Casavant Frères Limitée in 1986 on the 110th Anniversary of the passing of Mr. Stewart. Tours are offered upon request, as well as the Cathedral being open from 9 AM to 4 PM (Tuesday - Friday). Three regular weekly services are offered at 8 AM, 9:15 AM, and 11:15 AM; the 9:15 AM and 11:15 AM services feature choral music by the Cathedral Choirs.

Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. is an apparel manufacturing company primarily known for its largest brand, Dickies. The company was founded in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1922 by C. N. Williamson and E. E. \\"Colonel\\" Dickie, who began a denim bib overall company selling workwear to farm and ranch hands around the Southwest. Today, Dickies is a global brand found in more than 100 countries designing, manufacturing and selling workwear to the automotive, hospitality, construction and medical industries. Williamson- Dickie also owns the Walls, Liberty and Kodiak brands. Beginnings C.N. Williamson and E.E. \\"Colonel\\" Dickie began their business careers in the \\"vehicle and harness\\" business in Bryan, Texas. In 1918, they and a few friends established the U.S. Overall Company. Then, in 1922, C. Don Williamson joined with his father and cousin to buy 100% of the overall company on a one- third-each basis and renamed it Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Company. From its early years, Williamson-Dickie enjoyed steady growth which was slowed only by the Great Depression, and during World War II, the company produced millions of uniforms for the nation's armed forces. In converting to civilian production after the war, C.

It is based on the Lesser Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Romania (used between 1922 and 1947), redesigned by Victor Dima. As a central element, it shows a golden aquila holding a cross in its beak, and a mace and a sword in its claws. It also consists of the three colors (red, yellow, and blue) which represent the colors of the national flag. The coat of arms was augmented on 11 July 2016 to add a representation of the Steel Crown of Romania. History The idea behind the design of the coat of arms of Romania dates from 1859, when the two Romanian countries, Wallachia and Moldavia, united under Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Then the two heraldic symbols, the golden aquila and the aurochs, were officially juxtaposed. Until 1866, there were many variants of the coat of arms, regarding the background color and the number of times the two main elements where represented. In 1866, after Carol I was elected Prince of Romania, the shield was divided into quarters: in the first and fourth an eagle was depicted, and in the second and third the aurochs; above the shield the arms of the reigning Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family was placed. After 1872, the coat of arms included the symbol of southern Bessarabia (after 1877, of Dobruja), two dolphins, in the fourth quarter; and the one of Oltenia, a golden lion, in the third quarter; on the shield the Steel Crown was placed, as a symbol of sovereignty and independence, after the Romanian War of Independence. The coat of arms remained unchanged until 1922, after World War I, when Transylvania was united with the Kingdom of Romania. Then the coat of arms of Transylvania was placed in the fourth quarter, with the Turul replaced by a black aquila, the third quarter depicted the joined coats of arms of Banat and Oltenia (the bridge of Apollodorus of Damascus and a golden lion respectively), and the coat of arms of Dobruja was placed in an insertion. The shield was placed on the chest of a golden crossed and crowned aquila, as a symbol of the Latinity of the Romanians. The aquila was placed on a blue shield, capped with the Steel Crown. The coat of arms had three versions: lesser, middle (with supporters and motto), and greater (the middle arms on a red mantle lined with ermine). After 1948, the Communist authorities changed both the flag and the coat of arms. The coat of arms was rather an emblem, faithful to the Communist pattern: a landscape (depicting a rising sun, a tractor and an oil drill) surrounded by stocks of wheat tied together with a cloth in the colors of the national flag. Until 1989, there were four variants, the first being changed shortly after 1948 (the proclamation of the republic), again changed in 1952 (a red star was added), and finally in 1966, when Romania ceased to be a People's Republic and became a Socialist Republic. Immediately after the 1989 Revolution, the idea came up of giving Romania a new, representative coat of arms. In fact, the very symbol of the Revolution was the flag with a hole in its middle where the communist coat of arms had been cut out. The heraldic commission set up to design a new coat of arms for Romania worked intensely, subjecting to the Parliament two final designs which were then combined. What emerged is the current design adopted by the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament in their joint session on September 10, 1992. In April 2016, deputies of the Judiciary Committee endorsed a bill voted previously by the Senate that returns the crown on the head of the eagle and mandates the public authorities to replace the existing emblems and seals to those provided by law until 31 December 2018 (to mark the centenary of the Union of Transylvania with Romania on 1 December 1918). The bill was adopted by the Chamber of Deputies on 8 June 2016 and promulgated by President Klaus Iohannis on 11 July 2016. Description The shield surmounting the eagle is divided into five fields, one for each historical province of Romania with its traditional symbol: * golden aquila - Wallachia (Muntenia) * aurochs - Moldavia (Moldova) and Bukovina (Bucovina) * dolphins - Seaside: Bessarabia/Budjak (18671878) and Dobruja (after 1878) * a black aquila, seven castles, a sun and a moon - Transylvania (Transilvania), Maramureș and Crișana * lion and Trajan's bridge - Oltenia and the Banat Romania’s coat of arms has as a central element the golden aquila holding an Orthodox cross. Traditionally, this eagle appears in the arms of the Argeș county, the town of Pitești and the town of Curtea de Argeș. It stands for the “nest of the Basarabs”, the nucleus around which Wallachia was organised. Since July 11, 2016 the coat of arms has been altered to include the heraldic representation of the Steel Crown of King Carol. A symbol of its royal past and a token for the period during 1881 and 1947 when Romania was de facto and de jure a monarchy, ruled by the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen house through its Romanian branch, founded by Carol. The aquila, being the symbol of Latinity and a heraldic bird of the first order, symbolises courage, determination, the soaring toward great heights, power, grandeur. It is to be found also in Transylvania's coat of arms. The shield on which it is placed is azure, symbolising the sky. The eagle holds in its talons the insignia of sovereignty: a mace and a sword, the latter reminding of Moldavia’s ruler, Stephen the Great whereas the mace reminds of Michael the Brave, the first unifier of the Romanian Countries. On the bird's chest there is a quartered escutcheon with the symbols of the historical Romanian provinces (Wallachia, Oltenia, Moldavia, Bessarabia, Transylvania, the Banat, Crisana, Maramureș) as well as two dolphins reminding of the country's Black Sea Coast (Dobruja). In the first quarter, Wallachia's coat of arms, an aquila or holding in its beak a golden Orthodox cross, accompanied by a golden sun on the right and a golden new moon on the left, is displayed against an azure background. In the second quarter, Moldavia's traditional coat of arms is shown, gules: an aurochs head sable with a mullet of or between its horns, a cinquefoil rose on the dexter and a waning crescent on the sinister, both argent. The third quarter features the traditional coat of arms of the Banat and Oltenia, gules: over waves, a golden bridge with two arched openings (symbolising Roman emperor Trajan’s bridge over the Danube), wherefrom comes a golden lion holding a broadsword in its right forepaw. The fourth quarter shows the coat of arms of Transylvania, Maramureș and Crișana: a shield parted by a narrow fesse, gules; in the chief, on azure, there is a black aquila with golden beak coming out of the fesse, accompanied by a golden sun on the dexter and a crescent argent on the sinister (symbolizing the Székelys); on the base, on or, there are seven crenellated towers, placed four and three (symbolizing the Saxons). Also represented are the lands adjacent to the Black Sea (Dobruja), on azure: two dolphins affronts, head down.

It was originally broadcast on PBS and later rebroadcast on PBS Kids. The show's title character is a Jack Russell Terrier. Wishbone lives with his owner Joe Talbot in the fictional town of Oakdale, Texas. He daydreams about being the lead character of stories from classic literature. He was known as \\"the little dog with a big imagination\\". Only the viewers and the characters in his daydreams can hear Wishbone speak. The characters from his daydreams see Wishbone as whichever famous character he is currently portraying and not as a dog. The show won four Daytime Emmys, a Peabody Award, and honors from the Television Critics Association. Wishbone's exterior shots were filmed on the backlot of Lyrick Studios's teen division Big Feats! Entertainment in Allen, Texas, and its interior shots were filmed on a sound stage in a warehouse in Plano, Texas. Additional scenes were filmed in Grapevine, Texas. This show garnered particular praise for refusing to bowdlerize many of the sadder or more unpleasant aspects of the source works, which usually enjoyed a fairly faithful retelling in the fantasy sequences. The show also inspired several book series. Altogether, more than fifty books have featured Wishbone, which continued to be published even after the TV series ended production. Reruns of the show continued to air on some PBS affiliates until September 2009. In 2006, when a PBS Kids Go! digital channel was announced, PBS planned to air Wishbone on the channel. However, when the digital channel was canceled, Wishbone returned in reruns on the PBS national program service. Wishbone clips came to the PBS Kids Go! website. The return to PBS lasted a short time, although some PBS affiliates continued to air Wishbone until their license to do so ran out. The show continued to air in reruns nationally until August 31, 2001. The show was replaced on the PBS Kids schedule on September 3, 2001 by Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat. In 1998 the TV movie Wishbone's Dog Days of the West was aired. The series aired on PBS Kids Sprout as part of its \\"Let's Go Show\\" block from 2007 to 2009. However, due to Sprout rebranding the next month, it was pulled from the schedule before it rebranded the channel. A film adaptation of the series from Universal Pictures and Mattel Films is in the works with Peter Farrelly serving as producer. Episodes A standard episode of Wishbone consists of an opening scene, introducing Wishbone's and his family's current situation (for example, Arbor Day planting a tree, or Joe catching a lunch lady attempting to donate food to a homeless shelter). When one of the main characters decides to get involved in the noble act, Wishbone flashes to a famous work of literature it reminds him of, usually with him playing the lead role, in costume. Wishbone may not play the lead role if the character is difficult to relate to (he plays Sancho Panza in Don Quixote) or is female (in the show's \\"Joan of Arc\\" episode, he plays Louis de Conte). By the end of both stories, the real-life situation usually follows the work of literature closely such as the King saving Robin Hood at the last minute, and the Principal saving Joe at the last minute. The last two minutes of nearly every episode feature Wishbone narrating some background description of how the episode was produced, including showing how stunts were performed, how costumes were designed, or how the visual effects were created. The series also featured a clip show episode called \\"Picks of the Litter\\". Cast * Soccer, also Slugger, Shiner, Phoebe, and Bear as Wishbone * Larry Brantley – Wishbone's voice *Jordan Wall – Joseph \\"Joe\\" Talbot * Christie Abbott – Samantha \\"Sam\\" Kepler * Adam Springfield – David Barnes * Mary Chris Wall – Ellen MacWilliam Talbot * Alex Morris – Nathaniel \\"Nathan\\" Barnes * Maria Arita – Ruth Vincent Barnes * Angee Hughes – Wanda Gilmore * Justin Reese – Nathaniel Bobelesky * Akin Babatunde – Homer Vincent * Adan Sanchez – Lee Natonabah/Dan Bloodgood * Rick Perkins – Mr. Bob Pruitt * Julio Cedillo – Travis del Rio * Mikaila Enriquez – Melina Finch * Paul English, Jr. – Marcus Finch * Joe Duffield – Damont Jones * Jarrad Kritzstein – Jimmy Kidd * Taylor Pope – Curtis Characters =Main= * Wishbone: The protagonist and titular character of the series. He is a well-read dog who sees parallels between classic literature and the dilemmas he and his human friends face every day. Wishbone is a male tri-color Jack Russell Terrier (white with brown and black markings), who lives with the Talbots at their home on Forest Avenue in Oakdale. * Joseph \\"Joe\\" Talbot: Wishbone's teenage owner, the only child of Steve and Ellen Talbot. Joe has brown hair and a great interest in sports, particularly basketball. He is a player on the Sequoyah Middle School basketball team. His best friends are Sam Kepler and David Barnes. His father Steve, a basketball coach, died from a rare blood disease when Joe was six years old. Portrayed by Jordan Wall. In the series final Joe is considering playing the drums in the high school jazz band. *David Barnes: Joe and Sam's best friend from school and Joe's next door neighbor. He lives with his parents, Nathan and Ruth Barnes, and his younger sister, Emily. David aspires to be a scientist. David and his family aren't seen or mentioned in \\"Wishbone's Dog Days of the West\\". Portrayed by Adam Springfield. * Samantha \\"Sam\\" Kepler: Joe and David's best friend from their school. Her father, Walter Kepler, owns and runs the local pizzeria, Pepper Pete's. She has long blonde hair and is the most outgoing and adventurous of the three friends. She is allergic to coconuts. Sam is a tomboy who enjoys soccer, roller hockey, photography, and drama. Her parents are divorced. Portrayed by Christie Abbott. * Ellen Talbot: Joe's widowed mother, who, like him, has dark brown hair. She works as the reference librarian at Henderson Memorial Library in Oakdale. It is revealed in an old high school yearbook that her maiden name is MacMillan. Portrayed by Mary Chris Wall. * Wanda Gilmore: The Talbots and The Barnes' slightly eccentric next door neighbor. Wanda is the owner of the Oakdale Chronicle newspaper and president of the local Historical Society, as well as a volunteer in other different venues. She is a very friendly and cheerful person but hates it when Wishbone digs up her flower beds and therefore finds him a nuisance at times (although she reconciles with him in a later episode \\"A Fleabitten Bargain\\"). She has a crush on Joe, David, and Sam's teacher, Bob Pruitt, and is in a steady relationship with him. Portrayed by Angee Hughes. =Recurring= * Robin: Joe, David, and Sam's friend. She loves playing basketball. Portrayed by Codie Brooks. *Nathaniel \\"Nathan\\" Barnes: Ruth's husband, David and Emily's father, Homer's brother-in-law, and Steve and Ellen's best friend. Nathan adores his family. Portrayed by Alex Morris. *Ruth Vincent Barnes: Nathan's wife, David and Emily's mother, Homer's sister, and Steve and Ellen's best friend. Ruth always reminds Emily and Tina to be good. In \\"Bark That Bark\\" it is revealed that her maiden name is Vincent. Portrayed by Maria Arita. * Damont Jones: The antagonist of the series. He is Oakdale's bully, always up to no good, who usually causes trouble with his friend Curtis. Wishbone loathes Damont to the point of doing some comedic harm to him especially during Oakdale's Halloween scavenger hunt. In one of the final episodes, an older and wiser Damont tentatively apologizes to Joe for his previous unfriendly attitude, and it is implied that they make peace and Damont starts having a good friendship with him afterwards. Portrayed by Joe Duffield. * Jimmy Kidd: Damont's obnoxious cousin. He appears in the second season of this series. Portrayed by Jarrad Kritzstein. * Emily Barnes: David's mischievous little sister who is often seen with her best friend Tina; a running gag seems to involve an adult telling Emily and Tina to be good, to which they reply in unison \\"we will\\", before giggling insincerely and making a plan to cook up some mischief. Emily also has an overt affinity for Wishbone; in the Season 1 episode \\"Homer Sweet Homer\\", she had him for show and tell, but she wanted to keep him for herself until Joe, David, and Sam came to get him back. She also plays t-ball for the Oakdale Tigers. In Season 1 Emily is in kindergarten. In Season 2 Emily is in 1st grade. Portrayed by Jazmine McGill in season 1 and by Brittany Holmes in Season 2. * Amanda Hollings: Sam's academic rival who always tries to prove she is smarter than Sam. Amanda is jealous of Sam. Portrayed by Elena Hurst. * Mr. Robert \\"Bob\\" Pruitt: Joe, David, and Sam's English teacher, who has a genuine love of the subject, and is very encouraging of his students, teaching them how to express themselves through written works.

He owns and operates Pepper Pete's Pizzeria in the later episodes. Portrayed by Bob Reed. * Nathaniel Bobelesky: A geeky kid who is terrible at sports but is still friends with Joe, David, and Sam. After he shows a natural talent for swiftly catching things, Sam helps Nathaniel become a hockey goalie, which earns him the respect of several players, including Damont. In another episode, he is revealed to be allergic to many things, especially dogs, although most of his allergies were in his imagination. Portrayed by Justin Reese. * Homer Vincent: David and Emily's maternal uncle, Ruth's brother, and Nathan's brother-in-law. He is the storyteller of traditional African folklore. He appears in the first season episode \\"Bark That Bark\\". Portrayed by Akin Babatunde. * Lee Natonabah: A Native American who is a college professor in Dances with Dogs. The actor Adan Sanchez performed as Oakdale's postman Dan Bloodgood throughout the show's second season. * Travis Del Rio: Oakdale's Sports and Games store owner and Melina and Marcus' uncle. He only appears in the second season of this series and in the TV movie.

Production Wishbone was conceived by Rick Duffield after brainstorming with his staff about \\"making a show for kids that was told from a dog’s point of view\\". In an interview with The New Yorker, Duffield recalled that he had had a habit of putting a voice to his dog's expressions. His eureka moment came when he was staring at a row of books on his shelf: > \\"The one that caught my eye that day was Frank Magill's Masterpieces of > World Literature. Well, what if a little dog with a big imagination could > take us into some of the greatest stories ever told? And, why not make him > the hero?\\" Inspired, Duffield produced a seven-minute pilot for the show. In the summer of 1993, he spent three days casting for the dog star at a motel courtyard in Valencia, California, United States, North America, looking at between 100 and 150 dogs. He elaborated in the interview with The New Yorker: > \\"[A]n extraordinary little Jack Russell named Soccer walked up and dazzled > us all. I filmed the teaser, which captured Wishbone’s character and > suggested the format of the show, and brought it to Alice Cahn at PBS. I > suppose convincing someone that it was a good idea came down to executing a > pretty fetching dog trick!\\" Duffield told Entertainment Tonight: > \\"Keeping up with the variety in the series is the biggest challenge. Because > Wishbone is the central figure of each show, and plays an integral role in > the contemporary story and the literary story, he's in almost every scene. > So he has a lot to do and designing scenes that can work with a dog, with > period actors and period sets, as well as kids in a contemporary world is a > big challenge.\\" Larry Brantley, the voice of Wishbone, said he got the job through: > \\"...the weirdest audition I think that's ever been or will ever be. I didn't > know what the dog looked like and they give (me) the barest of information, > 'there's going to be this great new kids show with this dog that talks and > we want you to come in and we want you to be funny' so I went to the first > audition having no idea what to do. In the callback I actually got to meet > Soccer for the first time...It was basically a five minute impromptu > audition...I never really read from the script, I was supposed to, but I > didn't. Rick Duffield, the executive producer, said, 'well, watch the dog > and just kind of follow along and see what he's doing right now.' Soccer was > obsessing like over this tennis ball...and he wasn't interested in me or > Rick Duffield or anybody else in the room, it was like tennis ball. And he > would stare at the tennis ball. I want the tennis ball...So it was like five > minutes about a tennis ball and I walked out of the audition saying, 'I > can't believe I just did five minutes about a tennis ball.' And then I got > the job. We may never understand.\\" Ultimately, Duffield wanted Wishbone to be an: > \\"...entertaining way for kids to get their first taste of great books. We > believe this show can cultivate a new appetite for reading by making kids > think it's fun to get to know these books. And it's intended to be fun, > action packed, clever and a way to get their first taste of great stories > that can become a valuable educational stepping stone in their lives. The > dog makes it all the more endearing and entertaining.\\" Despite acclaim from critics and educators, only 50 episodes were produced within a one-year time frame. The first 40 episodes were shown as a single season run in 1995, while the remaining 10 episodes became a second season in 1997–1998. Duffield told author Michael Brody that PBS halted production because the show did not have \\"merchandising potential.\\"  Broadcast and home media  The show also aired on Nickelodeon in the UK and Ireland, and on Nine Network in Australia. Only a handful of the Wishbone episodes have been released to VHS and DVD. There were also a few computer games in 1996, such as Wishbone Activity Center, Wishbone Print Tricks, and Wishbone and the Amazing Odyssey. Wishbone has also inspired several book series: Wishbone Classics, Wishbone Mysteries, and The Adventures of Wishbone, which is similar to the TV series. In 2004, Hit Entertainment released 4 DVDs of the show: \\"Hot Diggety Dawg\\", \\"The Impawsible Dream\\", \\"The Hunchdog of Notre-Dame\\" and \\"Paw Prints of Thieves\\". On February 15, 2011, Lionsgate released the Wishbone DVD, The Little Dog With a Big Imagination, which only includes the four previously released episodes.

Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita ( 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte.Middle English Dictionary There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off. The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants. Polygonum species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weedy, especially in moist soils in the USA. Description When the genus is defined narrowly, Polygonum species are annual or perennial herbaceous plants, rarely shrubby, with much branched stems. The leaves are arranged alternately, usually less than long, with a length greater than the width. They have a membranous ochrea (a sheath around the stem nodes). The flowers are usually bisexual, rarely unisexual, and have five (occasionally four) tepals, the outer being slightly different from the inner ones. There are usually four to six stamens and three (rarely two) styles. The fruit is three-sided. Taxonomy The genus Polygonum was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1754. The genus name is usually said to be from the Greek (poly-, 'many') and (gonu, 'knee' or 'joint'), in reference to the swollen jointed stem. p. 404 p. 148. However, long before Linnaeus, the name was used in Greek and Latin for a plant used medically. Discussing the plant he knew as polygonum in 1655, Matthias Martinius referred to Scribonius Largus (who wrote a list of prescriptions around 47 AD) and gave an alternative etymology, based on (gonos, 'offspring', 'seed'), the meaning of the name then being the Latin , i.e. 'fecund', 'with many offspring'. The Flora of North America says that a derivation meaning 'many seeds' is the \\"grammatically correct interpretation\\". Many members of the family Polygonaceae that are now placed in separate genera were at one time or other placed in Polygonum, including species of Fagopyrum, Fallopia, Persicaria and Reynoutria, and older sources frequently use much wider definitions of the genus. Molecular phylogenetic studies, particularly in the 21st century, have led to major changes. Clarifying the circumscription of genera split from Polygonum was described in 2015 as \\"still ongoing\\". =Classification and phylogeny= Polygonum is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera Duma and Atraphaxis, forming the so-called \\"DAP clade\\". Species Between 65 and 300 species have been recognised at various times, depending on the circumscription of the genus. A number of species that had been included in Polygonum have been moved into several other genera, including Bistorta, Fagopyrum, Fallopia, Koenigia, Persicaria and Reynoutria.

It is used in cosmetics as an antiperspirant and as a coagulant in water purification. In water purification, this compound is preferred in some cases because of its high charge, which makes it more effective at destabilizing and removing suspended materials than other aluminum salts such as aluminium sulfate, aluminium chloride and various forms of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and polyaluminium chlorisulfate, in which the aluminum structure results in a lower net charge than aluminium chlorohydrate. Further, the high degree of neutralization of the HCl results in minimal impact on treated water pH when compared to other aluminium and iron salts. Uses Aluminum chlorohydrate is one of the most common active ingredients in commercial antiperspirants. The variation most commonly used in deodorants and antiperspirants is Al2Cl(OH)5. Aluminum chlorohydrate is also used as a coagulant in water and wastewater treatment processes to remove dissolved organic matter and colloidal particles present in suspension. Safety The Food and Drug Administration considers the use of aluminum chlorohydrate in antiperspirants to be safe and it is permitted in concentrations up to 25%.Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 =Alzheimer's disease= Studies have found only a negligible association between exposure to and long-term use of antiperspirants and Alzheimer's disease. There is no adequate evidence that exposure to aluminium in antiperspirants leads to progressive dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Heather M. Snyder, the senior associate director of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association, has stated, \\"There was a lot of research that looked at the link between Alzheimer's and aluminum, and there hasn't been any definitive evidence to suggest there is a link\\". =Breast cancer= The International Journal of Fertility and Women's Medicine found no evidence that certain chemicals used in underarm cosmetics increase the risk of breast cancer. Ted S. Gansler, the director of medical content for the American Cancer Society, stated \\"There is no convincing evidence that antiperspirant or deodorant use increases cancer risk\\". However, there is continued concern over the use of aluminum chlorohydrate in cosmetics as the risk of toxic build up over time has not been ruled out. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) is currently designing a study to analyse the build up of aluminum chlorohydrate via dermal penetration to assess the risk of toxic build up. Structure Aluminum chlorohydrate is best described as an inorganic polymer and as such is difficult to structurally characterize. However, techniques such as gel permeation chromatography, X-ray crystallography and 27Al-NMR have been used in research by various groups including that of Nazar and Laden to show that the material is based on Al13 units with a Keggin ion structure and that this base unit then undergoes complex transformations to form larger poly-aluminum complexes. Synthesis Aluminum chlorohydrate can be commercially manufactured by reacting aluminum with hydrochloric acid. A number of aluminum-containing raw materials can be used, including aluminum metal, alumina trihydrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum sulfate and combinations of these. The products can contain by- product salts, such as sodium/calcium/magnesium chloride or sulfate. Because of the explosion hazard related to hydrogen produced by the reaction of aluminum metal with hydrochloric acid, the most common industrial practice is to prepare a solution of aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) by reacting aluminum hydroxide with hydrochloric acid. The ACH product is reacted with aluminum ingots at 100 °C using steam in an open mixing tank. The Al to ACH ratio and the time of reaction allowed determines the polymer form of the PAC n to m ratio.

A port for the Nintendo 64 console was released almost simultaneously with the arcade version, on November 11, 1996, making it the first-ever 4-player game for the Nintendo 64. The game was subsequently re-released as Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 (also ported to the PlayStation) and later in an Olympic version. Gameplay As opposed to the more realistic ice hockey gameplay seen in Electronic Arts' NHL series, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey features arcade-style gameplay, with moves such as \\"power saves\\", which cause the goaltender to briefly transform into a brick wall, \\"power shots\\", which set the net on fire or knock the goalie into the net, and \\"power checks\\", which send an ambulance across the top of the screen. It features high-scoring games and over-the-top fights. There is also a simulation mode for those looking for more realistic gameplay. The game allowed the creation of profiles and would keep track of important individual and team stats, including goals, assists, and wins, among others. Development Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey was the second game to result from a three-year deal for a line of signature video games featuring hockey star Wayne Gretzky, the first being Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars. The skating animations were created by videotaping Gretzky skating from different angles and building a 3D model to imitate his movements. The arcade hardware was built around the Voodoo Graphics chip. The game came in two models of cabinet, an upright and a JAMMA-compatible model. It was announced that the Nintendo 64 version would include fatalities after the fights, but Midway Games removed them from the final version. Reception Next Generation hailed Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey as \\"an arcade hockey game against which to measure others.\\" Though the reviewer suspected that the Nintendo 64 version's being released less than a month after the arcade version would prevent the game from achieving success in the arcades, he lauded the realistic physics, multiple play modes, comprehensive licensing, statistics tracking, and selection of moves. He also noted that the \\"Burst\\" button prevents situations where the puck gets out of reach for extended periods of time, ensuring continuous action. Most reviews for the Nintendo 64 version were mixed, generally praising the polygonal graphics and overall accurate recreation of the arcade version, but remarking that while the game is great fun with four players, the mediocre A.I. makes it impossible to enjoy in single-player mode. Most critics noted that while there is a simulation mode, it does not effectively translate the game into a realistic hockey sim, making it a disappointment to the hardcore hockey fan base. For some critics this was the game's key problem; Air Hendrix of GamePro, for example, concluded, \\"If fast, simple hockey appeals to you and your buds, Gretzky's there with all the right bells and whistles. Just don't expect the depth and staying power of EA's NHL series or Sony's Faceoff '97.\\" A critic for Next Generation similarly said, \\"Fanatical hockey fans will be disappointed, as more realistic and finer-tuned hockey games on other systems easily outdo this one ... but more action-hungry players will find Gretzky worth the money, if only because its multiplayer capabilities are a blast, the arcade mode is fast, and the fights, well, they just come with the territory.\\" However, GameSpots Tom Ham did not consider the lack of a true simulation option to be a problem at all, and concluded, \\"No more slower frame rates, small players, and limited perspectives: 64-bit action is here and boy what fun it is.\\" Both Tom Ham and Air Hendrix criticized the audio commentary as being too repetitive, while Joe Rybicki of Electronic Gaming Monthly found it impressive for a cartridge-based game to have an announcer at all.

Founded in 1888 as Miss Pierce's School, it is a 34-acre campus in Brookline, Massachusetts near Jamaica Pond.  History  Park's roots go back to 1888, when Miss Caroline Pierce began a proprietary school on Walnut Street in Brookline. In 1923, it was incorporated and named to commemorate Julia Park, principal from 1910-1922. A gift of land from Dr. and Mrs. James M. Faulkner, former Park parents and grandparents, provided the opportunity for the School to move in 1971 from Kennard Road in Brookline to a 34-acre, country-like setting near Jamaica Pond and opposite Larz Anderson Park. (provided from school website)  Campus  Park's facilities span a 34-acre campus. Park's library contains 30,000 volumes and audiovisual materials. Across the campus at 255 Goddard Avenue is Faulkner House, which provides office space and the After-School Program's main facility. https://www.parkschool.org/about/our-campus Construction The Park School The school's main building was constructed in 1971 from a modern architectural design by Earl Flansburgh & Associates under the direction of then Headmaster Robert S. Hurlbut, Jr. Built of reinforced precast concrete as a stack of modular classroom and office spaces with wall- length windows for more natural illumination of rooms, it exemplifies the brutalist concrete construction style pioneered by Swiss architect Le Corbusier. But its brick wall accents and its preserved oaks and Roxbury puddingstone outcroppings pay homage to historical New England building traditions and topography. The building features an inner courtyard with a \\"Space Churn\\" stainless steel mobile sculpture by George Rickey, donated by a Park parent in 1971. In 1996, the West Building designed by Graham Gund and Associates, added two full-sized basketball courts, three modern science labs, and four mathematics classrooms to the school's facilities. In 2008, the school completed a major expansion and renovation of all of the pre- kindergarten – grade 5 classrooms. A new wing houses Grade 4 & 5 classrooms, after-school program space, a conference room, and adjoins the newly renovated 5,400-square foot library.Howland, Jay. The Park School: One Hundred Years, 1888-1988. Brookline, MA: The Park School, 1988. In 2008, the school completed a major expansion and renovation of all of the PreKindergarten – grade 5 classrooms. A new wing houses Grade 4 & 5 classrooms, after-school program space, and adjoins the newly renovated 5,400-square foot library. During the summer of 2018, several renovation projects took place including significant updates to the Early Childhood classrooms (PreK & K), the accompanying Early Childhood/Discovery Playground, and the transformation of a Conference Room into a state-of-the-art Makerspace. Program The Park School is composed of two Divisions - Lower Division (PreK - Grade 4) and Upper Division (Grades 5-8) Hallmarks of Park's Lower Division * Social-emotional learning. We educate the whole child at Park. That includes developing listening skills, empathy, kindness, and compassion. * Students get the challenge they need. Every student is well known here. Our teachers make sure each child is given the appropriate challenge according to their unique learning style, skills, and needs. * Children find their voice. Beginning at a young age, students get many opportunities to share their ideas, their talents, and their love of learning. * Parents are our partners. Parents are a crucial part of their children’s progression. So we maintain frequent communication between you and your child’s teacher with weekly newsletters, daily informal check-ins, and comprehensive conferences in the fall and spring. * Project-based learning. To make learning engaging, holistic, and relevant, teachers create hands-on projects that bring lessons to life. * https://www.parkschool.org/academics/lower-division-prek-grade-4 Park’s Upper Division strikes a balance between academic rigor and creative exploration; high expectations and emotional support; preparing for the future and preserving the simplicity and sincerity of childhood. After Park, students enter the world with a developed sense of confidence, a joy of learning, and a hunger for the next intellectual endeavor. Hallmarks of Park's Upper Division * Strong and positive connections, including those with peers, are essential for adolescents to thrive. At Park, we curate opportunities for students to practice the essential social-emotional skills needed to build trust and effectively navigate conflict. Upper Division students also benefit from being the oldest students in the school, allowing them to be the “big kids” while avoiding pressures and distractions that can come in a high school setting. * * Upper Division structure and programming, including Advisory and Growth Education, promote the skills of self-awareness, organization, digital citizenship, collaboration, and conflict resolution. With Park’s teachers and advisors, adolescents learn the essential skills of reflection and self- advocacy, so they graduate from the Upper Division feeling known by others and knowing themselves as individuals, students, and community members. * * Upper Division Advisory – Each child in the Upper Division is part of a small advisory group made up of 5–7 students and one teacher that meets daily. Advisory time is spent on activities ranging from team-building games to problem solving to reflection and goal setting. In Advisory, students experience a one-on-one relationship with an adult who knows them well and serves as their trusted consultant for academic, personal, and social development. * At Park, students can act in a play or join a sports team without worrying about being cut from the roster, or they can explore and showcase their passion for artistic expression with audiences throughout the year. They can participate in and lead more than a dozen clubs, including: Model United Nations, Gender Sexuality Alliance, Math Club, Science Club, Green Club, Student Council, Service Council, Events Council and our multicultural club, Pangea. They can submit proposals of their own, such as the recently formed Dungeons & Dragons, Stock Market, Genetics, and Debate Clubs. * * Athletics for Grades 6–8 – More than 90 percent of Upper Division students choose to play on our varsity, junior varsity, or sixth-grade teams in a variety of 16 individual and team sports. These interscholastic teams play one or two games per week and travel to other independent schools nearby to compete. Some eighth graders guide their peers as captains, which builds their capacity to lead others on and off the field. https://www.parkschool.org/academics/upper-division-grades-5-8 Schedule At Park, the academic year runs from September to June. School begins at 8:15 a.m. for all students. On Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, school is dismissed at 3 p.m.; Tuesday at 2 p.m. (This time is used by the faculty for professional development and departmental meetings.) PreK is a half-day program until 12 noon. Kindergarten is dismissed at 12 p.m. on Monday and Friday, 2p.m. on Tuesday, and 3 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday. Extracurricular activities Various extracurricular activities are offered in the After-School Program for PreK – Grade 5. Families may sign up for two to five afternoons per week; pick-up times are 3 p.m., 4:30 p.m. or 6 p.m. Students in Grades 6 – 8 are encouraged to participate in elective sports or after-school drama. In addition, clubs and a quiet study hall are offered until 4:30 p.m. Park offers three seasons of sports, as well as three seasons of theater production, that students may participate in. Sports include Flag Football, Soccer, Field Hockey, Volleyball and Cross Country in the fall, Basketball, Wrestling and Ice Hockey in the winter, and Lacrosse, Softball and Track and Field in the spring. Theater choices change term to term and include both modern and classical theater, with a musical in the winter term. Annual events School-wide events include Grandparents' & Special Friends' Day on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving; Yule Festival – a longstanding holiday assembly that acknowledges both the common and varying traditions of the school's diverse community in songs and readings that capture the principles and spirit of Hanukkah, Christmas, and Kwanzaa; and May Day – a special assembly welcoming spring for students in Pre-K through Grade 5.

It is a branch of animal husbandry. Sheep are raised principally for their meat (lamb and mutton), milk (sheep's milk), and fiber (wool). They also yield sheepskin and parchment. Sheep can be raised in a range of temperate climates, including arid zones near the equator and other torrid zones. Farmers build fences, housing, shearing sheds, and other facilities on their property, such as for water, feed, transport, and pest control. Most farms are managed so sheep can graze pastures, sometimes under the control of a shepherd or sheep dog. The major sources of income for a farm come from the sale of lambs and the shearing of sheep for their wool. Farmers can select from various breeds suitable for their region and market conditions. When the farmer sees that a ewe (female adult) is showing signs of heat or estrus, they can organise for mating with males. Newborn lambs are typically subjected to lamb marking, which involves tail docking, mulesing, earmarking, and males may be castrated.A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep Sheep: A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep. Sheep production worldwide Sheep farming in Namibia (2017) According to the FAOSTAT database of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the top five countries by number of heads of sheep (average from 1993 to 2013) were: mainland China (146.5 million heads), Australia (101.1 million), India (62.1 million), Iran (51.7 million), and the former Sudan (46.2 million).FAOSTAT database. Approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. In 2013, the five countries with the largest number of heads of sheep were mainland China (175 million), Australia (75.5 million), India (53.8 million), the former Sudan (52.5 million), and Iran (50.2 million). In 2018 Mongolia has 30.2 million sheep. In 2013, the number of heads of sheep were distributed as follows: 44% in Asia, 28.2% in Africa; 11.2% in Europe, 9.1% in Oceania, 7.4% in the Americas. The top producers of sheep meat (average from 1993 to 2013) were as follows: mainland China (1.6 million); Australia (618,000), New Zealand (519,000), the United Kingdom (335,000), and Turkey (288,857). The top five producers of sheep meat in 2013 were mainland China (2 million), Australia (660,000), New Zealand (450,000), the former Sudan (325,000), and Turkey (295,000). =U.S. sheep production= In the United States, inventory data on sheep began in 1867, when 45 million head of sheep were counted in the United States.Sheep, Lamb & Mutton: Background, United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service (last updated May 26, 2012). The numbers of sheep peaked in 1884 at 51 million head, and then declined over time to almost 6 million head. Since the 1960s, per capita consumption of lamb and mutton has declined from nearly 5 pounds (about 2 kg) to just about 1 pound (450g), due to competition from poultry, pork, beef, and other meats. Since the 1990s, U.S. sheep operations declined from around 105,000 to around 80,000 due to shrinking revenues and low rates of return. According to the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, the \\"sheep industry accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. livestock industry receipts.\\"  Reproduction  = Lamb grafting and artificial rearing = If a lamb is not receiving enough milk from the ewe (because of triplet lambs, ewes with bad udders, or another reason), it is a good management practice to graft the lamb onto another ewe or to feed the lamb artificially. Orphan lambs can be successfully raised on milk replacer, goat's milk, and cow's milk. However, cow's milk contains less fat than ewe's milk.  Lambing  An ewe with two newborn lambs Most lambs are born outdoors. Ewes can be made to give birth in fall, winter, or spring months, either by artificial insemination or by facilitating natural mating. Fall lambing is generally not done as the lamb crop percentage is likely to be low; ewes often need hormone therapy to induce estrus and ovulation, and farm labor is often busy elsewhere during fall lambing. Furthermore, fall-born lambs can be weak and small because of heat stress during the summer gestation period. Spring lambing has the advantage of coinciding with the natural breeding and lambing seasons, but supplemental feed is often needed. The advantage of winter lambing is that the lambs are weaned in spring when pastures are most fertile. This allows the lambs to grow more quickly, and to be sold for slaughter during the summer (when prices are generally high), but it results in roughly one in every four newborn lambs dying within a few days of birth due to malnutrition, disease, or exposure to the harsh cold. In the UK, it results in around 4 million newborn lamb deaths. 'Accelerated lambing' is the practice of lambing more than once a year, typically every 6 to 8 months. The advantages of accelerated lambing include increased lamb production, having lambs available for slaughter at different seasons, year-round use of labor and facilities, and increased income per ewe. It requires intensive management, early weaning, exogenous hormones, and artificial impregnation. It is often used to make old or soon-to-be infertile ewes give birth one more time before they are slaughtered.  Lamb marking  After lambs are several weeks old, lamb marking is carried out.Wooster This involves ear tagging, docking, mulesing, and castrating. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike when compared to the alternative of letting sheep collect waste around their buttocks. The Merino breed, accounting for around 80% of the wool produced in Australia, have been selectively bred to have wrinkled skin resulting in excessive amounts of wool while making them much more prone to flystrike. To reduce the risk of flystrike caused by soiling for the lambs who make it to summer, Merino lambs are often mulesed at the same time, which involves cutting off the skin around their buttocks and the base of their tail with metal shears. If the lambs are younger than 6 months, it is legal to do this in Australia without any pain relief. Male lambs are typically castrated. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. A common castration technique is 'elastration,' which involves a thick rubber band being placed around the base of the infant's scrotum, obstructing the blood supply and causing atrophy. This method causes severe pain to the lambs who are provided no pain relief during the process. Elastration is also commonly used for docking. Though no laws mandate this practice, depending on the preference of the shepherd, docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth to minimize pain, stress, recovery time, and complications.MAFF (UK) 2000. Sheep: codes of recommendations for the welfare of livestock. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, London.Canadian Veterinary Medical Association. Position Statement, March 1996. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they save money, and inflict only temporary pain.Simmons & Ekarius  Healthcare   Nutrition  Sheep feeding, 1912 Although sheep primarily consume pasture roughage, they are sometimes given supplemental feed, such as corn and hay. Sheep require water, energy (carbohydrates and fats) for optimal growth and production.  Shearing  Sheep not meant to be eaten are typically shorn annually in a shearing shed. Ewes tend to be shorn immediately prior to lambing. Shearing can be done with either manual blades or machine shears. In Australia, sheep shearers are paid by the number of sheep shorn, not by the hour, and there are no requirements for formal training or accreditation. Because of this, it is alleged that speed is prioritised over precision and care of the animal. = Crutching = Crutching is the practice of removing wool for hygiene reasons, typically from around the face and buttocks.  Saleyards  Sheep sold for slaughter often pass through saleyards, also known as auctions.  Slaughter  Sheep in a slaughterhouse. When sheep can no longer produce enough wool to be considered profitable, they are sent to slaughter and sold as mutton, and lambs raised for meat are killed between 4 and 12 months of age. Sheep have a natural lifespan of 12–14 years.  Herding   Facilities   Breeds   Environmental Impact  George Monbiot's 2013 book Feral attacks sheep farming as \\"a slow-burning ecological disaster, which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution.

It has a distinctive white face and forehead which inspired the name, because bles is the Afrikaans word for a blaze such as one might see on the forehead of a horse. Affinities and status The blesbok and the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygargus) are subspecies of the same species and can readily interbreed, the hybrid offspring being known as the bontebles or baster blesbok; the differences between the two subspecies have arisen due to preferences for different habitats in the wild. The blesbok is endemic to southern Africa and is found in large numbers in all national parks with open grasslands, from the Highveld north of the Vaal River southwards through the Free State, to the Eastern Cape. It is a plains species and dislikes wooded areas. It was first discovered in the 17th century, in numbers so numerous herds reached from horizon to horizon.Gordon-Cumming, Roualeyn. Five Years of a Hunter's Life in the Far Interior of South Africa. Publisher: J. Murray. ca 1850. May be downloaded from: https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Roualeyn+Gordon+-Cumming%22 Physical characteristics Juvenile blesboks Physically, rams and ewes are remarkably similar. Their mass can be as much as 85 kg. A characteristic of the blesbok is the prominent white blaze on the face and a horizontal brown strip which divides this blaze above the eyes. Body colour is brown with a lighter-coloured saddle on the back, and the rump an even lighter shade. The legs are brown with a white patch behind the top part of the front legs. Lower legs whitish. Both sexes carry horns, ringed almost to the tip. Female horns are slightly more slender. The neck and the top of the back of the blesbok is brown. Lower down on the flanks and buttocks, the coloring becomes darker. The belly, the inside of the buttocks and the area up to the base of the tail is white. Blesbok can be easily differentiated from other antelopes because they have a distinct white face and forehead. The blesbok differs from the bontebok by having less white on the coat and the blaze on the face, which is usually divided, the coat is also a lighter yellow than that of the bontebok. The length of their horns averages at around 38 cm. Male adult blesbok average around 70 kg; females average lower, at around 61 kg.Blesbuck * Body length: * Shoulder height: * Tail length: * Weight: Habitat Blesbok can be found in open veld or plains of South Africa and Namibia. Their preferred habitat is open grassland with water. They often occupy relatively small territories of 2.5 to 6.0 acres in size. They were once one of the most abundant antelope species of the African plains, but have become scarce since 1893 due to relentless hunting for their skins and meat. Reproduction ZOO Dvůr Králové, Czech Republic The blesbok is a seasonal breeder, with rutting from March to May. Births peak during November and December after a gestation period of about 240 days (8 months). Females give birth to a single calf per breeding season.Kruger Park: Blesbok Status The blesbok was hunted nearly to extinction because of its large numbers, but having been protected since the late 19th century, it has proliferated and today it is sufficiently numerous not to be classed as endangered. In modern times, this is largely because of the commercial value of the blesbok to private land owners, and also because it is one of the few medium-sized antelopes that can be contained by normal stock fencing. As of 2017, blesbok numbers have had an upward trend, and are estimated to be at least 54,000, with about 69% of these thought to be genetically pure.There are at least 17,000 in protected areas.The principal threat is thought to be hybridization with the bontebok. Predators Humans, lions, leopards, African wild dogs, spotted hyenas, and cheetahs are the blesbok's main predators, while jackals and eagles may attack calves. The blesbok is both farmed and hunted for its skin and meat and for trophies. Blesbok are shy and alert; they rely on speed and endurance to escape predators, but have an tendency to return to the place where they were attacked after a few minutes. They can maintain a speed of when chased, but, like other white-fronted damalisques, blesbok are not good jumpers. They are, however, very good at crawling under things. Paleontology Fossil remains of a prehistoric relative, Damaliscus niro, were found in deposits in Sterkfontein. With a weight of approximately 120 kg, it was heavier than the modern blesbok and it had slightly different horns. D. niro became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene 12,000 years ago.Brett Hilton-Barber, Lee R.

() is an American food product company that sells fruit juices, smoothies and food bars. It was founded in Santa Cruz, California, in 1980 and since 1995 is headquartered in Half Moon Bay, California. Odwalla's products include juices, smoothies, soy milk, bottled water, organic beverages, and several types of energy bars, known as \\"food bars\\". The company experienced strong growth after its incorporation in 1985, expanding its distribution network from California to most of North America, and went public in 1993. In 2001, Odwalla was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company for US$181 million and became a wholly owned subsidiary. A period of decline occurred as the result of a fatal outbreak of E.coli O157:H7 in 1996 that was caused by using bruised fruit that had been contaminated. Odwalla originally sold unpasteurized juices, claiming that the process of pasteurization altered the flavor of the juice. Following the E.coli outbreak, caused by Odwalla's failure to follow proper sanitary procedures, that caused the death of at least one child, Odwalla adopted flash pasteurization and other sanitization procedures. Odwalla recalled its juices and experienced a 90% reduction in sales following the event. The company gradually recovered and, the following year, became profitable again. In July 2020, Coca-Cola announced it would permanently discontinue the Odwalla brand by August 2020. History =Origin= Odwalla was founded in Santa Cruz, California, in 1980 by Greg Steltenpohl, Gerry Percy, and Bonnie Bassett. Odwalla's production facility is in Dinuba, California. The trio took the idea of selling fruit juices from a business guidebook, and they began by squeezing orange juice with a secondhand juicer in a shed in Steltenpohl's backyard. They sold their product from the back of a Volkswagen van to local restaurants, employing slogans such as \\"soil to soul, people to planet and nourishing the body whole\\". The name for their start-up, \\"Odwalla\\", was taken from that of a character who guided \\"the people of the sun\\" out of the \\"gray haze\\" in the song-poem \\"Illistrum\\", a favorite of the founders, which was composed by Roscoe Mitchell and performed by the Art Ensemble of Chicago jazz group, of which Mitchell was a member.Strassman, Roy, \\"Drink No Evil\\" [biographical article on Steltenpohl], common ground; The Bay Area's Magazine for Conscious Community since 1974, July/August 2009, p. 14. Steltenpohl, Percy, and Bassett related this to their products, which they believe \\"help humans break free from the dull mass of over-processed foods so prevalent today\\". =Incorporation to 1996= The headquarters of Odwalla Inc. in Half Moon Bay, California Odwalla was incorporated in September 1985 after five years of growth and expanded to sell products in San Francisco in 1988. Hambrecht & Quist Inc., a venture capital firm in San Francisco, was one of Odwalla's main investors at the time, investing several million dollars in the company. By 1992, the company employed 80 people at its company headquarters in Davenport, California, and sold around 20 different flavors of juice for between $1.50 and $2.00 a pint. Odwalla went public in December 1993 (NASDAQ:ODWA); the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13 million a year. Soon afterwards, Odwalla expanded into new markets when it bought two companies in the Pacific Northwest and Colorado. Odwalla built a new production facility located in Dinuba, California, in 1994 in order to better meet production demands. The following year, the company moved its headquarters to Half Moon Bay, California. Continual growth and outside investments during these years allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59 million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla one of the largest fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100 million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were healthier than regular juice because they were not pasteurized. =Adversity, recovery, growth and discontinuation= On October 7, 1996, Odwalla made a batch of apple juice using blemished fruit, resulting in one death and 66 sickened customers. Odwalla made and marketed unpasteurized fruit juices for the health segment of the juice market. This batch was contaminated with E. coli. A bottle of Odwalla Future Shake Despite a net loss for most of 1997, Odwalla worked to rehabilitate its brand name. In addition to advertising its new safety procedures, Odwalla released its line of food bars (its first solid food product line) and entered the $900 million fruit bar market. Another new product was the Future Shake, a \\"liquid lunch\\" aimed at younger consumers. Because of these efforts, Odwalla was again profitable by the end of 1997, reporting a profit of $140,000 for the third quarter. Having recovered, the company worked to expand geographically into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and by the end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29 million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha brand names for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla- brand juice. Odwalla was purchased by The Coca-Cola Company in 2001 for $15.25 a share, a deal which totalled $181 million and was unanimously approved by the Odwalla board of directors. Under the terms of the merger, Odwalla's management stayed on as heads of the company, and it was \\"folded\\" into Coca- Cola's Minute Maid department. The acquisition was one of several similar mergers which were aimed at expanding Coca-Cola's product line to include non- carbonated drinks. Odwalla benefited by obtaining up to a 124.3 percent premium on shares of the company, as well as from the stability and strength that ownership by The Coca-Cola Company offered. Under \\"Reasons for the recommendation of the Board; Factors considered\\" Odwalla also was able to expand into new markets because of Coca-Cola's well-established distribution network. Odwalla continued to grow following the acquisition. This growth resulted in part from new product releases, which included a line of PomaGrand pomegranate juice (released at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival), two flavors of energy drinks, and three flavors of \\"Soy Smart\\" drinks, which contain soy protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and calcium. Coca-Cola promoted Odwalla products in 2006 when the company aimed at removing carbonated soda products in schools. Odwalla continued to have good growth in 2007, when Coca-Cola, squeezed by poor growth in its North American markets, issued a company-wide hiring freeze; Odwalla, because of its good performance, was one of the few exceptions to the rule. In July 2020, Coca-Cola announced the permanent discontinuation of all Odwalla products, having declared Odwalla one of its \\"zombie brands\\" (brands which comprise less than 2% of total revenue). Production A refrigerated Odwalla display case at a grocery store; Odwalla uses these cases to increase its products' visibility. Odwalla uses what it characterizes as \\"fresh-sourced\\" produce (fruits and vegetables that have recently been harvested) to make many of its products, as well as organic oats for food bars and certain tropical fruits in a frozen purée form, purchased from an outside source and blended with fruit juice. Because Odwalla uses fresh produce, some juices are seasonal. Under the \\"It's Still the New Age\\" section. Fruit availability and price is also affected by adverse weather, disease, and natural disasters. Throughout the year, Odwalla juice colors and flavors change slightly because different types of fruit are used. After the E. coli outbreak, Odwalla improved the safety of several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products. Products =Drinks= A box of Banana Nut bars and two Chocolate Chip Protein bars Odwalla Inc. produces many flavors of fruit and vegetable drinks, as well as dairy-free soy milk (marketed under the \\"Soy Smart\\" name), \\"PomaGrand\\" pomegranate juice, \\"Serious Energy\\" caffeinated fruit juice, bottled spring water, and Odwalla's Superfood smoothie line of products (see green smoothie), which are viewed as the core products of the company and are made of various fruit purées, wheat grass, and barley grass. These products accounted for roughly 95 percent of Odwalla's revenue in 2001. Odwalla juice is sold in individual 12 fl oz (formerly 450 millilitre or 15.4 US fl oz) bottles made of plant-based recyclable HDPE plastic, as well as larger 64 US fluid ounce (1.9 litre) containers. Odwalla's juice, because of production costs, is \\"typically sold at prices higher than most other juice products\\", and the price of the juice can vary over time because of weather or disease affecting the supply of fruit and vegetables. Odwalla's sugar content can be even higher than Coca-Cola's. For example, Odwalla's \\"Mango Tango\\" has 3.67 grams of sugar per ounce—almost 1 full teaspoon of sugar in every ounce of juice. Coca-Cola contains 3.25 grams of sugar per ounce. This translates to 44 grams of sugar (nearly four tablespoons) in a 12-ounce \\"Mango Tango\\" versus 39 grams of sugar in a 12-ounce Coke. Throughout its history, Odwalla has produced and subsequently withdrawn various juice flavors due to their lower popularity, including the Odwalla Superfood Amazing Purple, Soy Vanilla, and Pomegranate Mango drinks. =Food bars= In September 1998, Odwalla began to sell energy bars made with fruit and grains, called food bars, as an alternative to its drinks in an attempt to raise revenue following the 1996 E. coli outbreak. The first three flavors released were Cranberry Citrus, Organic Carrot & Raisin, and Peach Crunch, all three of which are now discontinued. Within eight weeks of their release, the Odwalla Bar was one of the top- selling energy bar brands in the market. The bars come in a variety of flavors, and weigh 2 ounces (56 grams) per bar. As of 2001, before Odwalla was acquired by Coca-Cola, food bars accounted for less than five percent of Odwalla's revenue.

He served as a member of the Knesset for the Alignment, Ratz and Meretz between 1974 and 2006. A former Minister of Education and Minister of the Environment, he led Meretz between 1996 and 2003 and served as Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003. Known for his determined moral stance and his willingness to pay the political price for that determination, Sarid was often referred to as Israel's moral compass. Biography Yosef (Yossi) Sarid was born in Rehovot, Sarid served in the Artillery Corps and as a Military Correspondent during his national service in the IDF. He earned an MA in political science from New School for Social Research in New York City. He was a resident of Margaliyot in the Upper Galilee. Sarid was married to Dorit, with whom he had three children, including the writer Yishai Sarid. He died on the evening of 4 December 2015 from an apparent heart attack. He is buried in Kibbutz Givat Hashlosha cemetery, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Political and journalism career Sarid worked as a media aide to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. He was first elected to the Knesset in 1973 on the Alignment list. He was re-elected in 1977, 1981 and 1984. After the Alignment agreed to join a national unity government with Likud in 1984, Sarid left the party on 22 October to join Shulamit Aloni's Ratz.Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups Knesset website He was re-elected on the Ratz list in 1988. In 1992, Ratz merged with Shinui and Mapam to form Meretz. The new party won 12 seats in the elections that year and joined Yitzhak Rabin's coalition. Sarid was appointed Minister of the Environment, a position he kept when Shimon Peres formed a new government after Rabin's assassination in 1995. In 1996, Sarid replaced Aloni as Meretz leader. Although the Labor Party won the most seats in elections that year, Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu won the special election for Prime Minister and formed a right-wing government. In the 1999 elections, Meretz won 10 seats. Although Sarid had vowed not to join a coalition that included the ultra-Orthodox Shas, Ehud Barak persuaded Sarid to join the government, making him Minister of Education. Sarid explained the breaking of his vow in the need to promote the peace process. However, in 2000 Sarid resigned from the government and Meretz quit the coalition after failing to agree on authority to be given for Shas deputy minister of education. In the 2003 elections, Meretz was reduced to 6 seats, after which Sarid resigned as party leader, to be replaced by Yossi Beilin. He remained a member of the Knesset until the 2006 elections, when Meretz was reduced to 5 seats, after which he retired from politics, a plan he had announced the previous year. In 2009, Meretz's presence was further reduced to three seats in the Knesset. Sarid wrote a weekly column for Haaretz newspaper.

He was taught informally by his conductor step-father Konstantin Lyadov from 1860 to 1868, and then in 1870 entered the St. Petersburg Conservatory to study piano and violin. He soon gave up instrumental study to concentrate on counterpoint and fugue, although he remained a fine pianist. His natural musical talent was highly thought of by, among others, Modest Mussorgsky, and during the 1870s he became associated with the group of composers known as The Mighty Handful. He entered the composition classes of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, but was expelled for absenteeism in 1876.

Consistent with his character, he was a variable but at times brilliant instructor. Conductor Nikolai Malko, who studied harmony with him at the conservatory, wrote, \\"Lyadov's critical comments were always precise, clear, understandable, constructive, and brief.... And it was done indolently, without haste, sometimes seemingly disdainfully. He could suddenly stop in midword, take out some small scissors from his pocket and start doing something with his fingernail, while we all waited.\\"Malko, Nikolai, Vospominaniia [Reminiscences], p. 45. Igor Stravinsky remarked that Lyadov was as strict with himself as he was with his pupils, writing with great precision and demanding fine attention to detail. Prokofiev recalled that even the most innocent musical innovations drove the conservative Lyadov crazy. \\"Shoving his hands in his pockets and rocking in his soft woollen shoes without heels, he would say, 'I don't understand why you are studying with me. Go to Richard Strauss. Go to Debussy.' This was said in a tone that meant 'Go to the devil!'\\"Prokofiev, Sergei, Materialy [Materials], p. 138. Still, Lyadov told his acquaintances about Prokofiev. \\"I am obliged to teach him. He must form his technique, his style—first in piano music.\\"Quoted in Vospominaniia o B.V. Asaf'eve [Reminiscences of B.V. Asafyev] (Leningrad, 1974), p. 82. In 1905 he resigned briefly over the dismissal of Rimsky-Korsakov, only to return when Rimsky-Korsakov was reinstated. = Glazunov, Belyayev and Tchaikovsky = Portrait of M. P. Belyayev by Ilya Repin (1886) Lyadov introduced timber millionaire and philanthropist Mitrofan Belyayev to the music of the teenage Alexander Glazunov.Volkov, 349. Interest in Glazunov's music quickly grew to Belyayev's patronage of an entire group of Russian nationalist composers.Volkov, 349. In 1884 he instituted the Russian Symphony Concerts and established an annual Glinka Prize.Maes, 173. The following year he started his own publishing house in Leipzig. He published music by Glazunov, Lyadov, Rimsky-Korsakov and Borodin at his own expense.Volkov, 349.Maes, 173. In addition, young composers appealed for Belyayev's help.Maes, 173. Belyayev asked Lyadov to serve with Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov on an advisory council to help select from these applicants.Maes, 173. The group of composers that formed eventually became known as the Belyayev Circle.Volkov, 349. In November 1887, Lyadov met Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Nearly seven years earlier Tchaikovsky had given a negative opinion to the publisher Besel about a piano arabesque Lyadov had written.Tchaikovsky, Pyotr, Polnoye sobraniye sochinery: literaturnïye proizvedeniya i perepiska [Complete Edition: literary works and correspondence] (Moscow, 1953–1981), vol. 9, 36. As quoted in Brown, Tchaikovsky: The Final Years, 91. Even before this visit, though, Tchaikovsky's opinion of Lyadov may have been changing. He had honored Lyadov with a copy of the score of his Manfred Symphony. Now that he had actually met the man face-to-face, the younger composer became \\"dear Lyadov.\\"Brown, Tchaikovsky: The Final Years, 91. He became a frequent visitor to Lyadov and the rest of the Belyayev Circle, beginning in the winter of 1890.Rimsky- Korsakov, 308 + 309 footnote. = Later years = He married into money in 1884, acquiring through his marriage a country property in Polynovka estate, Borovichevsky uezd, Novgorod Governorate, where he spent his summers composing unhurriedly, and where he died in 1914.  Music  U.S.S.R. postage stamp commemorating Lyadov's centennial While Lyadov's technical facility was highly regarded by his contemporaries, his unreliability stood in the way of his advancement. His published compositions are relatively few due to his natural indolence and a certain self-critical lack of confidence. Many of his works are variations on or arrangements of pre-existing material (for example his Russian Folksongs, Op. 58). He did compose a large number of piano miniatures, of which his Musical Snuffbox of 1893 is perhaps most famous. Like many of his contemporaries, Lyadov was drawn to intensely Russian subjects. Much of his music is programmatic; for example his tone poems Baba Yaga Op. 56, Kikimora Op. 63, The Enchanted Lake Op. 62 (inspired by the painting by Arseny Meshchersky, \\"The Enchanted Lake). These short tone poems, probably his most popular works, exhibit an exceptional flair for orchestral tone color. In his later compositions he experimented with extended tonality, like his younger contemporary Alexander Scriabin. It has been argued that Lyadov never completed a large-scale work. However, many of his miniatures have their place in the repertory. In 1905 Lyadov began work on a new ballet score, but when the work failed to progress, he shifted gears to work on an opera instead. Lyadov never finished the opera, but sections of the work found realization in the short tone poems Kikimora and The Enchanted Lake. In 1909 Sergei Diaghilev commissioned Lyadov to orchestrate a number for the Chopin-based ballet Les Sylphides, and on 4 September that year wrote to the composer asking for a new ballet score for the 1910 season of his Ballets Russes;Taruskin, pp. 576–7 however, despite the much-repeated story that Lyadov was slow to start composing the work which eventually became The Firebird (famously fulfilled by the then relatively inexperienced Igor Stravinsky), there is no evidence that Lyadov ever accepted the commission.See Taruskin, pp. 577–8  Selected works  * Biryulki, 14 pieces for piano, Op. 2 (1876) * Six Pieces for piano, Op. 3 (1876–1877) # Prelude in D major # Gigue in F major # Fugue in G minor # Mazurka in G major # Mazurka in B major # Mazurka in C major * Four Arabesques for piano, Op. 4 (1878) # Arabesque in C minor # Arabesque in A major # Arabesque in B major # Arabesque in E major * Etude in A major for piano, Op. 5 (1881) * Impromptu in D major for piano, Op. 6 (1881) * Two Intermezzi for piano, Op. 7 (1881) # Intermezzo in D major # Intermezzo in F major * Two Intermezzi for piano, Op. 8 (1883) # Intermezzo in B major # Intermezzo in B major * Two Pieces for piano, Op. 9 (1883) # Valse in F minor # Mazurka in A major * Three Pieces for piano, Op. 10 (1884) # Prelude in D major # Mazurka in C major # Mazurka in D major * Three Pieces for piano, Op. 11 (1885) # Prelude in B minor # Mazurka in the Dorian Mode # Mazurka in F minor * Etude in E major for piano, Op. 12 (1886) * Four Preludes for piano, Op. 13 (1887) # Prelude in G major # Prelude in B major # Prelude in A major # Prelude in F minor * Two Mazurkas for piano, Op. 15 (1887) # Mazurka in A major # Mazurka in A minor * Scherzo in D major for orchestra, Op. 16 (1879–1886) * Two Bagatelles for piano, Op. 17 (1887) # Bagatelle in B minor (La Douleur) # Bagatelle in B major (Pastoral) * Village Scene by the Inn, Mazurka for orchestra, Op. 19 (1887) * Novellette in A minor for piano, Op. 20 (1882–1889) * About Olden Times, Ballade in D major for piano, Op. 21a (1889) * About Olden Times, Ballade in D major for orchestra, Op. 21b (1889) * In the Clearing, Esquisse in F major for piano, Op. 23 (1890) * Two Pieces for piano, Op. 24 (1890) # Prelude in E major # Berceuse in G major * Idylle in D major for piano, Op. 25 (1891) * Little Waltz in G major for piano, Op. 26 (1891) * Three Preludes for piano, Op. 27 (1891) # Prelude in E major # Prelude in B major # Prelude in G major * Final scene from Schiller's Die Braut von Messina for solo voices, chorus and orchestra, Op. 28 (1878, published 1891).

History =Before the strike= In 1887, Henry, James, Benjamin, and Robert Oxnard sold their Brooklyn sugar refinery and moved to California to capitalize on the growing agricultural economy of the late nineteenth century.\\"Sugar Men Divided by Threat of Jail.\\" The New York Times, June 17, 1911. In 1897, following the enactment of the Dingley Tariff Bill that heavily taxed foreign sugar, Henry, James, and Robert Oxnard formed the American Beet Sugar Company. Although the seasonal Chinese and Mexican laborers already in place in the county easily satisfied agricultural labor needs early in the factory's history, decline in Chinese populations due to Chinese Exclusion Acts and use of Mexican workers in other agricultural efforts led to an increase in Japanese worker recruitment. A group of 1,000 Japanese farm workers were recruited in 1900 by labor contractors. By 1902 nine major Japanese contractors saw to the seasonal needs in the area.Almaguer p. 187. Since these contractors had already caused minor slowdowns and protests over wages, recently arrived bank owners and merchants organized an owner-interest oriented contracting company called the Western Agricultural Contracting Company (WACC). The WACC quickly replaced the Japanese contractors as principal contractors to the Oxnard Plain and even forced some of them to subcontract through the WACC. Comprising more than 90 percent of the work force, the WACC had a near monopoly of the workers. =The strike and the JMLA= On February 11, 1903, 500 Japanese and 200 Mexican laborers became the charter members of the Japanese-Mexican Labor Association (JMLA) joined together and formed their organization based on the grievances of the Oxnard laborers. Overcoming obvious language barriers between the two constituent groups, they immediately elected Kosaburo Baba (president), Y. Yamaguchi (secretary of the Japanese branch), and J.M. Lizarras (secretary of the Mexican branch); Baba and Lizarras were both labor contractors and Yamaguchi has been recognized as a boarding student recruited from San Francisco. Their immediate concerns opposed the WACC on three conditions: * they accused the WACC of artificially suppressing wages; * they opposed the subcontracting system arguing that it forced workers to pay double commissions; and * they called for the freedom to buy goods rather than be subjected to the inflated prices of the company store. In order to remedy these issues, the JMLA membership ceased working through the WACC (essentially declaring a strike). The strike came at a serendipitously precarious time in the sugar beet season, the staple crop of Oxnard Plain agriculture, since the labor-intensive and yield-defining work of thinning the seedlings needed to be done within the scope of a few weeks. By the first week in March, the JMLA recruited a membership larger than 1,200 workers (over 90% of the labor force of the county's beet industry). The JMLA's increased recruitment pulled the WACC's former contracted workers from it and essentially brought the sugar industry to a standstill. On March 23, 1903, the strike reached its turning point. Although an official investigation blamed the violence and sole death of Mexican laborer Luis Vasquez on the strikers, witnesses certify that Anglo farmers shot into a crowd of strikers thus killing Vasquez and wounding four others. With the highly negative press reaction to the incident, the WACC conceded to most of the laborers' demands.\\"A History of Mexican Americans in California: Historic Sites: The Cottage Hotel.\\" Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California. National Park Service Japanese and Mexican laborers, formerly pitted against each other, had unified to achieve their labor goals. The success JMLA achieved showed the effectiveness of a multi- racial labor front and showed that class, and not race, could be the unifier in labor organizing.Ramirez, Raymond (2002). \\"Immigrant Workers and 'Shared Leadership'.\\" Asian American Studies Classweb Nevertheless, the JMLA was unable to hold on to its victories as it lost authority due to the American Federation of Labor(AFL) under Samuel Gompers denying them a charter due to their large Japanese membership.Acuña, Rodolfo.

Individuals with severe valgus deformities are typically unable to touch their feet together while simultaneously straightening the legs. The term originates from the Latin genu, 'knee', and valgus which actually means 'bent outwards', but in this case, it is used to describe the distal portion of the knee joint which bends outwards and thus the proximal portion seems to be bent inwards. For citation and more information on uses of the words Valgus and Varus, see varus deformity. Mild genu valgum is diagnosed when a person standing upright with the feet touching also shows the knees touching. It can be seen in children from ages 2 to 5, and is often corrected naturally as children grow. However, the condition may continue or worsen with age, particularly when it is the result of a disease, such as rickets. Idiopathic genu valgum is a form that is either congenital or has no known cause. Other systemic conditions may be associated, such as Schnyder crystalline corneal dystrophy, an autosomal dominant condition frequently reported with hyperlipidemia. Cause Genu valgum can arise from a variety of causes including nutritional, genetic, traumatic, idiopathic or physiologic and infectious. =Rickets= Nutritional rickets is an important cause of childhood genu valgum or knock knees in some parts of the world. Nutritional rickets arises from unhealthy life style habits as insufficient exposure to sun light which is the main source of vitamin D. Insufficient dietary intake of calcium is another contributing factor. Similarly, genu valgum may arise from rickets caused by genetic abnormalities, called vitamin D-resistant rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia. =Osteochondrodysplasia= Osteochondrodysplasia are a variable group of genetic bone diseases or genetic skeletal dysplasias that present with generalized bone deformities involving all extremities and the spine. Genu valgum or knock knees is one of the known skeletal manifestations of Osteochondrodysplasias. A complete bone X-ray survey is mandatory to reach a definitive diagnosis. =Trauma= Diagnostic  Image showing how Q-angle is measured The degree of genu valgum can clinically be estimated by the , which is the angle formed by a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine through the center of the patella and a line drawn from the center of the patella to the center of the tibial tubercle. In women, the Q angle should be less than 22 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 9 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. In men, the Q angle should be less than 18 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 8 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. A typical Q angle is 12 degrees for men and 17 degrees for women. =Radiography= On projectional radiography, the degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the hip-knee-ankle angle, which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint. It is normally between 1.0° and 1.5° of varus in adults. Normal ranges are different in children. File:Hip-knee-ankle angle.pngHip-knee-ankle angle. File:Hip-knee-ankle angle by age.pngHip-knee-ankle angle by age, with 95% prediction interval. Treatment The treatment of genu valgum in children depends on the underlying cause. Developmental also known as idiopathic genu valgum is usually self-limiting and resolves during childhood. Genu valgum secondary to nutritional rickets is typically treated with life style modifications in the form of adequate sun exposure to ensure receiving the daily requirements of vitamin D and nutrition with rich calcium diet. Additionally calcium and vitamin D supplementations may be used. If the deformity does not resolve despite the above conservative treatment and the deformity is severe and causing gait impairment, then surgery can be an option. Typically, guided growth surgery is used to straighten the deformed bone. Genu valgum arising from osteochondrodysplasia usually needs repeated guided growth surgical interventions. Genu valgum secondary to trauma depends on the degree of physeal damage. And usually limb reconstruction procedures are needed, especially if trauma occurs in the early years of life where the anticipated remaining longitudinal bone growth is great. The treatment of genu valgum in adults depends on the underlying cause and the degree of joint involvement namely arthritis. Bone corrective osteotomies and prosthetic joint replacement may be used depending upon the patient's age and symptomatology in terms of pain and functional impairment. Weight loss and substitution of high- impact for low-impact exercise can help slow progression of the condition. With every step, the patient's weight places a distortion on the knee toward a knocked knee position, and the effect is increased with increased angle or increased weight. Even in the normal knee position, the femurs function at an angle because they connect to the hip girdle at points much further apart than they connect at the knees. Working with a physical medicine specialist such as a physiatrist, or a physiotherapist may assist a patient learning how to improve outcomes and use the leg muscles properly to support the bone structures. Alternative or complementary treatments may include certain procedures from Iyengar Yoga or the Feldenkrais Method.

Justine is set just before the French Revolution in France and tells the story of a young girl who goes under the name of Thérèse. Her story is recounted to Madame de Lorsagne while defending herself for her crimes, en route to punishment and death. She explains the series of misfortunes that led to her present situation. History of the work Justine (original French title: Les infortunes de la vertu) was an early work by the Marquis de Sade, written in two weeks in 1787 while imprisoned in the Bastille. It is a novella (187 pages) with relatively little of the obscenity that characterized his later writing, as it was written in the classical style (which was fashionable at the time), with much verbose and metaphorical description. A much extended and more graphic version, entitled Justine ou Les Malheurs de la vertu (1791) (English title: Justine, or The Misfortunes of the Virtue or simply Justine), was the first of de Sade's books published. A further extended version, La Nouvelle Justine ou Les Malheurs de la vertu (The New Justine), was published in the Netherlands in 1797. This final version, La Nouvelle Justine, departed from the first-person narrative of the previous two versions, and included around 100 engravings. It was accompanied by a continuation, Juliette, about Justine's sister. The two together formed 10 volumes of nearly 4000 pages in total; publication was completed in 1801. Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the arrest of the anonymous author of Justine and Juliette, and as a result de Sade was incarcerated for the last 13 years of his life. The book's destruction was ordered by the Cour Royale de Paris on May 19, 1815. Modern publication There is standard edition of this text in hardcover, having passed into the public domain. The text itself is often incorporated into collections of de Sade's work. A censored English translation of Justine was issued in the US by the Risus Press in the early 1930s, and went through many reprintings. The first unexpurgated English translation of Justine (by 'Pieralessandro Casavini', a pseudonym for Austryn Wainhouse) was published by the Olympia Press in 1953. Wainhouse later revised this translation for publication in the United States by Grove Press (1965). Other modern translated versions in print is the Wordsworth edition of 1999, it is a translation of the first original version, where Justine calls herself Sophie and not Therese. The final 1797 version La Nouvelle Justine has never been published in English translation, although it was published in French in the permissive conditions of the late 1960s, as part of two rival limited- editions of the definitive collected works of de Sade: Jean-Jacques Pauvert's Oeuvres completes de Sade (1968, 30 volumes) and Cercle du Livre Precieux's Oeuvres completes du Marquis de Sade: editions definitive (1967, 16 volumes). Plot summary The plot concerns Justine, a 12-year-old maiden (\\"As for Justine, aged as we have remarked, twelve\\") who sets off to make her way in France. It follows her until age 26 in her quest for virtue. She is presented with sexual lessons, hidden under a virtuous mask. The unfortunate situations include: the time when she seeks refuge and confession in a monastery, but is forced to become a sex slave to the monks, who subject her to countless orgies, rapes and similar rigours and the time when, helping a gentleman who is robbed in a field, he takes her back to his chateau with promises of a post caring for his wife, but she is then confined in a cave and subject to much the same punishment. These punishments are mostly the same throughout, even when she goes to a judge to beg for mercy in her case as an arsonist and then finds herself openly humiliated in court, unable to defend herself. These are described in true Sadean form. However, unlike some of his other works, the novel is not just a catalogue of sadism. Justine (Thérèse (or Sophie in the first version)) and Juliette were the daughters of Monsieur de Bertole. Bertole was a widower banker who fell in love with another man's lover. The man, Monsieur de Noirseuil, in the interest of revenge, pretended to be his friend, made sure he became bankrupt and eventually poisoned him, leaving the girls orphans. Juliette and Justine lived in a nunnery, where the abbess of the nunnery corrupted Juliette (and attempted to corrupt Justine too). However, Justine was sweet and virtuous. When the abbess found out about Bertole's death, she threw both girls out. Juliette's story is told in another book and Justine continues on in pursuit of virtue, beginning from becoming a maid in the house of the usurer Harpin, which is where her troubles begin anew. In her search for work and shelter Justine constantly fell into the hands of rogues who would ravish and torture her and the people she makes friends with. Justine was falsely accused of theft by Harpin and sent to jail expecting execution. She had to ally herself with a Miss Dubois, a criminal who helped her to escape along with her band. To escape, they had to start a fire in the prison, in which 21 people died. After escaping the band of Dubois, Justine wanders off and accidentally trespasses upon the lands of the count of Bressac. The story is told by \\"Thérèse\\" (\\"Sophie\\" in the first version) in an inn, to Madame de Lorsagne. It is finally revealed that Madame de Lorsagne is her long-lost sister. The irony is that her sister submitted to a brief period of vice and found herself a comfortable existence where she could exercise good, while Justine refused to make concessions for the greater good and was plunged further into vice than those who would go willingly. The story ends with Madame de Lorsagne relieving her from a life of vice and clearing her name. Soon afterward, Justine becomes introverted and morose and is finally struck by a bolt of lightning and killed instantly. Madame de Lorsagne joins a religious order after Justine's death. Scholarship Simone de Beauvoir called Justine \\"la bêlante Justine\\". One scholar commented: > The libertines derive as much satisfaction from defeating their opponents > intellectually as they do from subduing and abusing them physically, while > the victims themselves (and Justine offers the best example of this) rise > admirably to the challenge with equally forceful and reasoned replies. James Fowler writes that \\"her piety offers her the most intense pleasure she can experience in life\\" and describes her responses to the libertine Marquis de Bressac as \\"pious hedonism\\". Legacy In 1798, the rival writer Rétif de la Bretonne published his Anti-Justine. In Lars von Trier's 2011 film Melancholia, the main character, played by Kirsten Dunst, is named after de Sade's Justine. A retelling in contemporary terms, is The Turkish Bath, a 1969 novel published by Olympia Press, allegedly by Justine and Juliette Lemercier in an autobiographical format.The Turkish Bath. Juliette Lemercier, Justine Lemercier. Olympia Press, 1969. In 1957 Lawrence Durrell's Justine was part one of the Alexandria Quartet. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The story has been adapted for film several times, most notably in a 1969 international co-production directed by Jesus Franco and starring Jack Palance, Romina Power, and Klaus Kinski as the Marquis, titled Marquis de Sade: Justine. There has also been a graphic novel version by Guido Crepax. In 1973, the Japanese director Tatsumi Kumashiro filmed an adaptation of Justine as part of Nikkatsu's Roman Porno series. The film was titled . In 1977, a film version of the novel, entitled Cruel Passion, was released. Justine was also featured in the 2000 film Quills based on the life of the Marquis de Sade. For her film Raw, Julia Ducournau said in an interview with Variety‘Raw’ Director ‘Shocked’ Two Viewers Fainted During Cannibal Film at TIFF that she chose to name the protagonist after Sade's Justine.

This was followed by advanced training in July 1943 at A.P. Hill Military Reservation near Fredericksburg, Virginia. Winter training started in September 1943 at Camp McCoy in Wisconsin. (Skis, snowshoes, toboggans, snow tractors, snow goggles, winter camouflage suits, Eskimo parkas, etc.) Simultaneously, advanced training group moved in November 1943 to Northern Michigan near Watersmeet. Winter training experts from Mountaining Training Center at Camp Hale, Colorado gave special training program. Additional winter training began at Ottawa National Forest near Watersmeet, Michigan on 19 February 1944. During this training temperatures dropped to −28 °F. Four exercises were conducted during which the 385th Infantry Regiment (headquartered in Pori, Michigan, opposed the division as an enemy force. On 12 March 1944, the division returned to Camp McCoy. 7,000 troops were taken from the 76th to build up forces for the impending invasion of France (D-Day) during April 1944. In November 1944, trains headed to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts for staging before transport to Europe. On Thanksgiving Day 1944, three transports sailed from Boston Port of Embarkation to Europe. The 304th Infantry plus a Division Headquarters party sailed on the SS Brazil. The 304th reached Southampton, England on 4 December 1944. The 385th Infantry crossed the Atlantic on the SS Sea Owl. The 385th reached Southampton on 4 December 1944. The 417th Infantry sailed on the SS Marine Raven. The 417th docked at Plymouth 4 December 1944. The remainder of the division sailed from Boston on 10 December 1944 aboard the Coast Guard operated transport SS Richardson. The SS Richardson docked at the Clyde River near Grenoch, Scotland on 12 December 1944. The remainder of the Division Headquarters sailed from New York on 4 December on the Dutch liner New Amsterdam. =Combat chronicle= The 76th Infantry Division arrived in England, 20 December 1944, where it received additional training. It landed at Le Havre, France, 12 January 1945, and proceeded to the Limesy concentration area. The Division moved to Beine east of Reims and then to Champlon, Belgium, 23 January, to prepare for combat. Relieving the 87th Division in defensive positions along the Sauer and Moselle Rivers in the vicinity of Echternach, Luxembourg, 25 January, the 76th sent out patrols and crossed the Sauer, 7 February, and breached the Siegfried Line in a heavy assault. The advance continued across the Prum and Nims Rivers, 25–27 February. Katzenkopf fortress and Irrel fell on 28 February and the attack pushed on toward Trier, reaching the Moselle, 3 March. Driving across the Kyll River, the division took Hosten, 3 March, Speicher on 5 March and Karl on 10 March; swung south and cleared the area north of the Moselle, crossing the river, 18 March, near Mülheim an der Mosel. Moving to the Rhine, the 76th took over defenses from Boppard to St. Goar and crossed the Rhine at Boppard, 27 March. It drove east and took Kamberg in a house-to-house struggle, 29 March. A new attack was launched 4 April and the Werra River was reached the next day. The attack continued in conjunction with the 6th Armored Division; Langensalza fell and the Gera River was crossed, 11 April. Zeitz was captured after a violent struggle, 14–15 April, and the 76th reached the Mulde River on 16 April, going into defensive positions to hold a bridgehead across the Mulde near Chemnitz until VE-day. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 2,395Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 433Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Wounded in action: 1,811Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Missing in action: 10Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Prisoner of war: 141Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) =Awards= Medal of Honor: *Pvt.

Units of the division were spread throughout the six New England states. For the next 13 years, the division served as a traditional line Infantry division, training annually at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts and at Pine Camp (now Fort Drum), New York. In May 1959, the Division was re-designated and reorganized as the 76th Division (Training) with the mission of training initial (basic) entry soldiers of various branches and in later years the division also became able to train infantry volunteers or draftees. In this role during 1985 and 1986, in an operation codenamed \\"Onaway Eagle\\", the division successfully defined, established and executed the first USAR (United States Army Reserve) mobilization army training center at Fort Campbell, Kentucky which became the model for utilization and employment of other reserve training divisions in the United States Army. In Operation Onaway Eagle, elements of the division successfully conducted Basic Combat Training for hundreds of new soldiers. In 1990–1991, during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the division validated and deployed to the Middle East over 600 of its soldiers where they served with distinction with the Third Army. As part of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the 1205th Transportation Railway Services Unit (later 1205th Transportation Railway Operating Battalion), based in Middletown, CT, was mobilized to augment civilian railway employees at Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, a U.S. Army munitions outport located just south of Wilmington, NC, bringing in tons of explosives by rail to the secure port for shipment to the war zone. On 1 October 1994, the division was again redesignated and on 18 April 1995 was reorganized as the 76th Division (Institutional Training). Just over two years later, the division was inactivated on 15 November 1996 at West Hartford, Connecticut. The commander at the time was BG John G Pappas, who served in this position from 1 Oct 1994 until 9 Sept 1996. Reactivation in 2013 to present In February 2013, Major General Daniel York sought a historical designation for a new command being stood up in the Army Reserve. The 76th Division was reactivated as the 76th USAR Operational Response Command (ORC) and is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Their mission is to provide operational engagement packages and joint enabling capabilities for homeland response, cyber defense, legal support, information operations, and global force space enhancement requirements to combatant, unified, Joint and Department of Defense Agency Commanders. From October 2015 to September 2017, Major General Ricky L. Waddell served as commanding general of the 76th Operational Response Command. From November 2017 to June 2018, Major General A.C. Roper served as commanding general of the 76th Operational Response Command. From June 2018 to July 2019, Brigadier General Douglas A. Cherry served as commanding general of the 76th Operational Response Command. From July 2019 to March 2020, Major General Frederick R. Maiocco served as Commanding General. From March 2020 to August 2020, Brigadier General Douglas A. Cherry served as Commanding General. Brigadier General Miles Davis is the current Commanding General. The command is made up of over 6,000 soldiers with a presence in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and select locations in Europe.

It is most commonly used for low birth- weight preterm babies, who are more likely to suffer from hypothermia, while admitted to a neonatal unit to keep the baby warm and support early breastfeeding. Kangaroo care, named for the similarity to how certain marsupials carry their young, was initially developed in the 1970s to care for preterm infants in countries where incubators were either unavailable or unreliable. There is evidence that it is effective in reducing both infant mortality and the risk of hospital-acquired infection, and increasing rates of breastfeeding and weight gain. Skin-to-skin care is also used to describe the technique of placing full-term newborns very soon after birth on the bare chest of their mother or father. This also improves rates of breastfeeding and can lead to improved stability of the heart and breathing rate of the baby. Medical uses Originally babies who are eligible for kangaroo care include pre-term infants weighing less than , and breathing independently. Cardiopulmonary monitoring, oximetry, supplemental oxygen or nasal (continuous positive airway pressure) ventilation, intravenous infusions, and monitor leads do not prevent kangaroo care. In fact, babies who are in kangaroo care tend to be less prone to apnea and bradycardia and have stabilization of oxygen needs.London, M., Ladewig, P., Ball, J., & Bindler, R. (2006). Maternal and child nursing care (2nd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall. (p. 573, 791 - 793)Robles, M. (1995). Kangaroo care: The human incubator for the premature infant. University of Manitoba, Women’s Hospital in the Health Sciences Centre: Winnipeg, MN. During the early 1990s, the concept was advocated in North America for premature babies in NICU and later for full term babies. Research has been done in developed countries but there is a lag in implementation of kangaroo care due to ready access of incubators and technology. Restrictions for eligibility to receive skin-to-skin contact are becoming fewer, the main constraint has probably been caregiver confidence and experience. =Evidence= In 2016 a Cochrane review, \\"Kangaroo mother care to reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants\\", was published bringing together data from 21 studies including 3042 low birth-weight babies (less than at birth). This review shows that babies provided kangaroo mother care have a reduced risk of death, hospital-acquired infection, and low body temperature (hypothermia); it is also associated with increased weight gain, growth in length, and rates of breastfeeding. A further Cochrane review on \\"Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy babies\\", updated in 2015, provides clinical support for the scientific rationale but looks at evidence for early skin-to-skin contact for healthy babies. The available evidence shows that early skin-to-skin contact is associated with increased rates of breastfeeding, and some evidence of improved physiological outcomes (early stability of the heart rate and breathing) for the babies. A randomized controlled trial published in 2004 reports that babies born between 1200 and 2200g became physiologically stable in skin-to-skin contact starting from birth, compared to similar babies in incubators. In another randomized controlled trial conducted in Ethiopia, survival improved when skin-to-skin contact was started before 6 hours of age. While Kangaroo Mother Care generally implies care of low birth weight and preterm infants, skin-to-skin contact should be regarded as normal and basic for all newly born humans. The original research by Thomson showed increased breastfeeding rates when skin- to-skin contact started at birth, and when early breastfeeding was encouraged every two hours. Currently, the impact of skin-to-skin contact on breastfeeding is the scientific rationale for Step 4 of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), which requires help to \\"initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth\\".  Benefits  = Pain control = Skin-to-skin contact is effective in reducing pain in infants during painful procedures. There appears to be no difference between mothers and others who provide skin- to-skin contact during medical treatments. A Mother providing Kangaroo care to a preterm baby =For parents= Kangaroo care is beneficial for parents because it promotes attachment and bonding, improves parental confidence, and helps to promote increased milk production and breastfeeding success.Mohrbacher, N., & Stock, J. (2003). The breastfeeding answer book. Schaumburg, IL: LaLeche League International. (pp. 285-287) A recent study found that the psychological benefits of kangaroo care for parents of preterm infants are fairly extensive. Research shows that the use of kangaroo care is linked to lower parental anxiety levels. Amount of parental anxiety is related to parental age, family income, and socioeconomic status. Older parents may have additional life experience or resilience, leading to decreased anxiety. Higher socioeconomic status may contribute to less anxiety as well. These factors may lead to lower levels of baseline anxiety, and therefore a further decrease of anxiety following kangaroo care. Factors such as gestational age, parental gender, and marital status did not appear to affect parental anxiety. Kangaroo care was shown to decrease anxiety scores in both mothers and fathers, also unrelated to parents’ marital status. Kangaroo care has also lead to greater confidence in parenting skills. Parents who used kangaroo care displayed higher confidence in their ability to care for their child. Kangaroo care has been shown to positively impact breastfeeding as well, with mothers producing larger amounts of milk for longer periods of time. Overall, kangaroo care has many important benefits for parents as well as infants. =For fathers= Both preterm and full term infants benefit from skin to skin contact for the first few weeks of life with the baby's father as well. The new baby is familiar with the father's voice and it is believed that contact with the father helps the infant to stabilize and promotes father to infant bonding. If the infant's mother had a caesarean birth, the father can hold their baby in skin-to-skin contact while the mother recovers from the anesthetic. =Pre-term and low-birth-weight infants= Kangaroo care \\"is an effective and safe alternative to conventional neonatal care for LBW infants, mainly in resource-limited countries.\\" Kangaroo Mother Care reduces mortality, and also morbidity in resource limited settings, though further studies are needed. Kangaroo care arguably offers the most benefits for pre-term and low- birth-weight infants, who experience more normalized temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, increased weight gain, and fewer hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, studies suggest that preterm infants who experience kangaroo care have improved cognitive development, decreased stress levels, reduced pain responses, normalized growth, and positive effects on motor development. Kangaroo care also helps to improve sleep patterns of infants, and may be a good intervention for colic. Earlier discharge from hospital is also a possible outcome Finally, kangaroo care helps to promote frequent breastfeeding, and can enhance mother-infant bonding. Evidence from a recent systematic review supports the use of kangaroo mother care as a substitute for conventional neonatal care in settings where resources are limited.\\" =Promotes breastfeeding = Infant nursing shortly after birth According to some authorities there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that early skin-to-skin contact of mother and baby stimulates breast feeding behavior in the baby. Newborn infants who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of being born. It is thought that immediate skin-to-skin contact provides a form of imprinting that makes subsequent feeding significantly easier. The World Health Organization reports that in addition to more successful breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn baby immediately after delivery also reduces crying, improves mother to infant interaction, and keeps baby warm. According to studies quoted by UNICEF, babies have been observed to naturally follow a unique process which leads to a first breastfeed. After birth, babies who are placed skin to skin on their mothers chest will: * Initially babies cry briefly – a very distinctive birth cry * Then they will enter a stage of relaxation, recovering from the birth * Then the baby will start to wake up * Then begin to move, initially little movements, perhaps of the arms, shoulders and head * As these movements increase the baby will actually start to crawl towards the breast * Once the baby has found the breast and therefore the food source, there is a period of rest. Often this can be mistaken as the baby is not hungry or wanting to feed * After resting, the baby will explore and get familiar with the breast, perhaps by nuzzling, smelling and licking before attaching Providing that there are no interruptions, all babies are said to follow this process and it is suggested that trying to rush the process or interruptions such as removing the baby to weigh or measure is counter-productive and may lead to problems at subsequent breastfeeds. For mothers with low milk supply, increasing skin-to-skin contact is recommended, as it promotes more frequent feeding and stimulates the milk ejection reflex, prompting the body to produce more milk. =For institutions= Kangaroo care often results in reduced hospital stays, reduced need for expensive healthcare technology, increased parental involvement and teaching opportunities, and better use of healthcare dollars.  Technique  A woman holds her premature twin grandsons skin-to- skin. This position helps babies maintain the proper body temperature. Kangaroo care seeks to provide restored closeness of the newborn with family members by placing the infant in direct skin-to-skin contact with one of them. This ensures physiological and psychological warmth and bonding. The parent's stable body temperature helps to regulate the neonate's temperature more smoothly than an incubator, and allows for readily accessible breastfeeding when the mother holds the baby this way. While this model of infant care is substantially different from the typical Western neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) procedures, the two are not mutually exclusive, and it is estimated that more than 200 neonatal intensive care units practice kangaroo care. One survey found that 82 percent of neonatal intensive care units use kangaroo care in the United States. In kangaroo care, the baby wears only a small diaper and a hat and is placed in a flexed (fetal position) with maximum skin- to-skin contact on parent's chest. The baby is secured with a wrap that goes around the naked torso of the adult, providing the baby with proper support and positioning (maintain flexion), constant containment without pressure points or creases, and protecting from air drafts (thermoregulation). If it is cold, the parent may wear a shirt or hospital gown with an opening to the front and a blanket over the wrap for the baby. The tight bundling is enough to stimulate the baby: vestibular stimulation from the parent's breathing and chest movement, auditory stimulation from the parent's voice and natural sounds of breathing and the heartbeat, touch by the skin of the parent, the wrap, and the natural tendency to hold the baby. All this stimulation is important for the baby's development. \\"Birth Kangaroo Care\\" places the baby in kangaroo care with the mother within one minute after birth and up to the first feeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends this practice, with minimal disruption for babies that don't require life support. The baby's head must be dried immediately after birth and then the baby is placed with a hat on the mother's chest. Measurements, etc. are performed after the first feeding. According to the US Institute of Kangaroo Care, healthy babies should maintain skin-to-skin contact method for about 3 months so that both baby and mother are established in breastfeeding and have achieved physiological recovery from the birth process. For premature babies, this method can be used continuously around the clock or for sessions of no less than one hour in duration (the length of one full sleep cycle.) It can be started as soon as the baby is stabilized, so it may be at birth or within hours, days, or weeks after birth. Kangaroo care is different from the practice of babywearing. In kangaroo care, the adult and the baby are skin-to-skin and chest-to-chest, securing the position of the baby with a stretchy wrap, and it is practiced to provide developmental care to premature babies for 6 months and full-term newborns for 3 months. In babywearing the adult and the child are fully clothed, the child may be in the front or back of the adult, can be done with many different types of carriers and slings, and is commonly practiced with infants and toddlers. Rationale In primates, early skin-to-skin contact is part of a universal reproductive behaviour, and early separation is used as a research modality to test the harmful effects on early development. Research suggests that for all mammals, the maternal environment (or place of care) is the primary requirement for regulation of all physiological needs (homeostasis),Hofer MA. Early relationships as regulators of infant physiology and behaviour. Acta Paediatr 1994;Suppl 397:9-18. maternal absence leads to dysregulation and adaptation to adversity. In mainstream clinical medicine, Kangaroo Mother Care is used as an adjunct to advanced technology that requires maternal infant separation. However, skin-to-skin contact may have a better scientific rationale than the incubator. All other supportive technology can be provided as part of care to extremely low birth weight babies during skin-to-skin contact, and appears to produce a better effect. Based on the scientific rationale, it has been suggested that skin-to-skin contact should be initiated immediately, to avoid the harmful effects of separation (Bergman Curationis). In terms of classification and proper defining for research purposes, the following aspects that categorise and define skin-to-skin contact have been proposed: * Initiation time, (minutes, hours from birth), ideal is zero separation. * Dose of skin-to-skin contact, (hours per day, or as percentage of day), ideal >90%. * Duration, (measured in days or weeks from birth), ideally until infant refuses. Safe technique should ensure that obstructive apnoea cannot occur. Since the mother must be able to sleep to provide adequate dose, this requires keeping the airway safely open, and close containment to mother's bare chest using a garment, various of these are described in the WHO guidelines. Mother should be the primary provider of skin-to-skin contact, as only she can breastfeed. However, it is almost always necessary that father should also provide skin-to-skin contact to achieve adequate dose; other family members can also be used. Since skin-to-skin contact is basic to early bonding and attachment, it should probably not be done by hospital staff and other surrogates. Terminology Kangaroo Care is likely the most widely used term in the United States for skin-to-skin contact. Gene Cranston Anderson may have been the first to coin the term Kangaroo Care in the USA. The defining feature of this is however for skin-to- skin contact, commonly abbreviated as SSC, also STS. This is used synonymously with \\"skin-to-skin care\\".Rey SE, Martinez GH. Maejo racional del nino prematuro. Proceedings of the Conference 1 Curso de Medicina Fetal y Neonatal, 1981;Bogota, Colombia: Fundacion Vivar, 1983. (Spanish).(Manuscript available in English from UNICEF, 3 UN Plaza, New York, NY: 10017). Dr Nils Bergman, one of the founders of the Kangaroo Mother Care Movement, argues that since skin- to-skin contact is a place of care, not a kind of care in itself, skin-to-skin contact should be the preferred term. Kangaroo Mother Care is a broader package of care defined by the World Health Organization. Kangaroo Mother Care originally referred only to care of low birth weight and preterm infants, and is defined as a care strategy including three main components: kangaroo position, kangaroo nutrition and kangaroo discharge. Kangaroo position means direct skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby, but can include father, other family member or surrogate. The infant should be upright on the chest, and the airway secured with safe technique. (The term Kangaroo Mother Care is commonly used to mean skin-to-skin contact, despite its definition from the WHO as including a broader strategy).WHO. Kangaroo mother care - a practical guide. Geneva, Switzerland: WHO; 2003. Kangaroo nutrition implies exclusive breastfeeding, with additional support as required but with the aim of achieving ultimately exclusive breastfeeding. Kangaroo discharge requires that the infant is sent home early, meaning as soon as the mother is breastfeeding and able to provide all basic care herself. In Colombia in 1985 this took place at weights around 1000g, with oxygen cylinders for home use; the reason was that overcrowding in their hospital meant that three babies in an incubator would result in potentially lethal cross-infections. An essential part of this is close follow-up, and access to daily visits.  History  Peter de Chateau in Sweden first described studies of \\"early contact\\" with mother and baby at birth in 1976, articles do not describe specifically that this was skin-to-skin contact. Klaus and Kennell did very similar work in the US, more well known in the context of early maternal-infant bonding. The first reported use of the term \\"skin-to-skin contact\\" is by Thomson in 1979 and quotes the work of de Chateau in its rationale. This is contemporary or even precedes the origins of Kangaroo Mother Care in Bogota, Colombia. This latter did however make the concept more widely known. In 1978, due to increasing morbidity and mortality rates in the Instituto Materno Infantil NICU in Bogotá, Colombia, Dr. Edgar Rey Sanabria, Professor of Neonatology at Department of Paediatry - Universidad Nacional de Colombia, introduced a method to alleviate the shortage of caregivers and lack of resources. He suggested that mothers have continuous skin-to-skin contact with their low birth weight babies to keep them warm and to give exclusive breastfeeding as needed. This freed up overcrowded incubator space and care givers. Another feature of kangaroo care was early discharge in the kangaroo position despite prematurity. It has proven successful in improving survival rates of premature and low birth weight newborns and in lowering the risks of nosocomial infection, severe illness, and lower respiratory tract disease. It also increased exclusive breastfeeding and for a longer duration and improved maternal satisfaction and confidence. Dr Rey and Dr Martinez published their results in 1981 in Spanish, and used the term Kangaroo Mother Method. This was brought to the attention of English speaking health professionals in an article by Whitelaw and Sleath in 1985. Gene Cranston Anderson and Susan Ludington were instrumental in introducing this to North America. \\"Kangaroo Mother Care\\" as a term was first defined at a meeting of some 30 interested researchers, attending a meeting convened by Dr Adriano Cattaneo and colleagues in November 1996 in Trieste, Italy, together with the WHO represented by Dr Jelka Zupan. An International Network of Kangaroo Mother Care (INK) was convened at the Trieste meeting and has overseen workshops and conferences every two years. After Trieste, meetings were held in Bogota Colombia 1998, Yogyakarta Indonesia 2000, Cape Town South Africa 2002, Rio de Janeiro Brazil 2004, Cleveland USA 2006, Uppsala Sweden 2008, Quebec Canada 2010, Ahmedabad India 2012, and Kigali Rwanda 2014; the meeting in 2016 planned for Trieste Italy. An informal steering committee coordinates these meetings: (alphabetically, current) Nils Bergman, Adriano Cattaneo, Nathalie Charpak, Kerstin Hedberg-Nyqvist, Ochi Ibe, Susan Ludington, Socorro Mendoza, Mantoa Mokrachane, Juan Gabriel Ruiz, Réjean Tessier, Rekha Udani. Susan Ludington maintains a \\"KC BIB\\" (bibliography) on behalf of INK, endeavouring to be a complete inventory of any and all publications relevant to Kangaroo Mother Care. This is also broken down in an analysis of 120 charts, in which specific outcomes are collated. The International Kangaroo Care Awareness Day has been celebrated worldwide on May 15 since 2011. It is a day to increase awareness to enhance the practice of Kangaroo Care in NICUS, Post Partum, Labor and Delivery, and any hospital unit that has babies up to 3 months of age.  Society and culture  The International Kangaroo Care Awareness Day is celebrated on May 15 since 2011. It is a day to increase awareness, education, and celebration to enhance the practice of kangaroo care/skin to skin contact globally. Healthcare professionals, parents, volunteers around the world show their support, in their own way, for improving Kangaroo Care practice to benefit babies, parents, and society at large. Controversy The main controversy among proponents of Kangaroo Mother Care relates to eligibility to initiate kangaroo position: in the original Rey & Martinez model and as described in the WHO guidelines, the infant should be stable to \\"tolerate skin-to-skin contact\\". From a biological and neuroscience perspective, others argue that it is separation from mother that causes the instability. Regarding ‘kangaroo nutrition’ there is little controversy, with accumulating evidence for the benefits of breastfeeding as such,Eidelman AI. Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk: An Analysis of the American Academy of Pediatrics 2012 Breastfeeding Policy Statement. Breastfeed Med 2012 September 4. and evidence that even preterm infants can exclusively breastfeed. Further controversy concerns the ‘early discharge’, which is defended by the Fundación Canguro, in Bogota, Colombia, and reported in evidence from a Cochrane review.

After a brief training program, the division landed at Le Havre and Rouen, 13 December, and bivouacked at Yvetot on the 14th. When the Von Rundstedt offensive broke in the Ardennes, the 75th was rushed to the front and entered defensive combat, 23 December 1944, alongside the Ourthe River, advanced to the Aisne River, and entered Grandmenil, 5 January 1945. The division relieved the 82d Airborne Division along the Salm River, 8 January, and strengthened its defensive positions until 17 January when it attacked, taking Vielsalm and other towns in the area. Shifting to the Seventh Army area in Alsace—Lorraine, the 75th crossed the Colmar Canal, 1 February, and took part in the liberation of Colmar and in the fighting between the Rhine River and the Vosges Mountains. It crossed the Marne-Rhine Canal and reached the Rhine, 7 February. After a brief rest at Lunéville, it returned to combat, relieving the 6th British Airborne Division on a defensive front along the Maas River, near Roermond, in the Netherlands, on 21 February. From 13 to 23 March, the 75th patrolled a sector along the west bank of the Rhine from Wesel to Homburg, and probed enemy defenses at night. On 24 March, elements crossed the Rhine in the wake of the 30th and 79th Divisions. Pursuit of the enemy continued as the 75th cleared the Haard Forest, 1 April, crossed the Dortmund-Ems Canal on the 4th, and cleared the approaches to Dortmund, which fell to the 95th Division, 13 April. After taking Herdecke, 13 April, the division moved to Braumbauer for rest and rehabilitation, then took over security and military government duties in Westphalia.

It tells the story of high school student Lane Myer who is suicidal after his girlfriend breaks up with him shortly before Christmas. While the film was not a commercial or critical success at the time of its release, it has since been regarded as a cult classic. Plot In the town of Greendale in northern California, high school student Lane Myer's two main interests are skiing and his girlfriend of six months, Beth. Shortly before Christmas, Beth dumps Lane for the handsome and popular captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin. Roy is an arrogant bully who unfairly rejects Lane at ski team tryouts. Beth also criticizes Lane's car, an old station wagon. Although Lane also owns a 1967 Camaro, he has not been able to get it running and it sits on the drive in a dilapidated state. Lane lives in a suburban development with his mother, Jenny, a ditzy housewife who routinely concocts creepy (and creeping) family meals; his genius little brother, Badger, who never speaks but at the age of \\"almost 8\\" can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women from \\"How-to\\" books; and his lawyer father, Al, who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny, from breaking his garage door windows with thrown newspapers. Furthermore, Johnny claims that the Myers owe him two dollars for newspapers, and persistently hounds Lane yelling \\"I want my two dollars!\\" Lane also regularly encounters two Korean drag racers who speak in Japanese, one of whom learned to speak English by listening to Howard Cosell. Lane cannot get past Beth's rejection and decides that death is the only way out of his misery. He makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, which all comically fail. With the help of his best friend, Charles de Mar, (who in lieu of not being able to get \\"real drugs\\" in their small town, constantly inhales everyday substances like Jell-O, snow, and nitrous oxide in a whipped cream can) Lane tries to ski the K-12, the highest peak in town, in hopes of getting Beth back but wipes out. Lane is further embarrassed when he gets fired from his humiliating fast food job at Pig Burgers in front of Roy and Beth, who are there on a date. To top it all, he increasingly begins to suffer from neurotic hallucinations owing to the mounting frustrations in his life. As Lane attempts to either end his life or win back his ex-girlfriend, he gradually gets to know a new girl: a French foreign-exchange student named Monique, who has a crush on him. She is staying with Lane's overbearing neighbor Mrs. Smith, who continually tries to force Monique into being a girlfriend for her socially awkward son Ricky. The pair are so annoying that she pretends she cannot speak English. Monique, a Los Angeles Dodgers fan, turns out to be an excellent auto mechanic and skier who helps Lane fix his Camaro and tries to build his confidence. When Roy insults Monique, Lane challenges him to a ski race down the K-12, with the winner to be captain of the ski team. Monique helps Lane prepare for the race, which he ultimately wins despite losing a ski and being pursued by Johnny. Beth rushes to embrace Lane at the finish line, but he rejects her and after besting Ricky (who attempts to keep Lane from rescuing Monique from the restraints of his mother) in a ski-pole swordfight, drives off with Monique in his Camaro. Lane and Monique are last seen kissing on the home plate at Dodger Stadium, with Johnny bicycling towards them, while in a mid-credit scene Badger launches a home-made space shuttle from his room through the roof of the house.

Bill Cosford of The Miami Herald wrote, \\"Better Off Dead has the body of a tired teen comedy but the soul of an inspired student film; it's the first movie in a long time to interrupt itself periodically with flights of animated fancy.

Soundtrack The film's soundtrack was produced primarily by Rupert Hine. The opening track, \\"With One Look (The Wildest Dream)\\", was produced by Hine and features Cy Curnin and Jamie West-Oram of The Fixx on lead vocals and guitars respectively. Hine had previously worked with Curnin and West-Oram, and also contributed vocals to the song. The following track, \\"Arrested By You\\", as well as \\"Better Off Dub (Title Music)\\" and \\"Race The K-12 (Instrumental)\\" were performed solely by Hine. \\"Dancing in Isolation\\" features Terri Nunn of Berlin on lead vocals. Hine produced the song and was reportedly under consideration to produce an album for Berlin. \\"Come to Your Rescue\\" was performed by Thinkman, a group formed by, and including, Hine for the purpose of restoring his solo career without the music press knowing about it. West- Oram also provided guitar work to this song, as well as the instrumental \\"The Falcon Beat\\". The only two tracks on the CD without Hine's involvement are \\"A Little Luck\\" and \\"One Way Love (Better Off Dead).\\" Valley Girl's Elizabeth Daily, credited on the soundtrack as E. G. Daily, sang lead vocals on both songs and also performed them in the film during the high school dance scene. ;Track listing # \\"With One Look (The Wildest Dream)\\" – 3:26 (written by Torrence Merdur/Rupert Hine) # \\"Arrested By You\\" – 5:07 (written by Torrence Merdur/Rupert Hine) # \\"Shine\\" – 3:49 (written by Martin Ansell) # \\"Better Off Dub (Title Music)\\" – 3:48 (written by Rupert Hine) # \\"Dancing In Isolation\\" – 4:04 (written by Torrence Merdur/Rupert Hine) # \\"Come to Your Rescue\\" – 5:03 (written by Jeannette Obstoj/Rupert Hine) # \\"A Little Luck\\" – 4:21 (written by Angela Rubin) # \\"The Falcon Beat (Instrumental)\\" – 2:37 (written by Rupert Hine) # \\"One Way Love (Better Off Dead)\\" – 3:33 (written by Steve Goldstein/Duane Hitchings/Craig Krampf/Eric Nelson) # \\"Race The K-12\\" – 3:49 (written by Rupert Hine) * Tracks 1-6, 8, and 10 produced by Rupert Hine. * Tracks 7 and 9 produced by Steve Goldstein. =Personnel= *Martin Ansell - guitar, vocals *Cellophane - keyboards *Cy Curnin - vocals, backing vocals *E.G.

The company, which also owns Au Bon Pain, is owned by JAB Holding Company which is, in turn, owned by the Reimann family of Germany. Panera offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as bagels, brownies, cookies, croissants, muffins, and scones. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout including: flatbreads, panini, Panera Kids, pastas, salads, sandwiches, side choices, and soups, as well as coffee, espresso drinks, frozen drinks, fruit smoothies, hot chocolate, iced drinks, lattes, lemonade, and tea. During its final 20 years as a public company, from 1997 to 2017, it was the best performing restaurant stock, delivering an 86-fold return to shareholders. Panera was once the largest provider of free Wi-Fi hotspots in the United States. Many locations restrict the duration of free Wi-Fi to 30 or 60 minutes during peak hours. History In 1987, Ken and Linda Rosenthal founded The St. Louis Bread Company with the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. The Rosenthals invested $150,000 and received a $150,000 Small Business Administration loan. In 1993, Au Bon Pain Co., a public company, purchased the St. Louis Bread Company for $23 million. In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, from the Spanish language word panera, meaning \\"granary\\" or \\"breadbasket\\". At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company renovated its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area. In May 1999, Au Bon Pain Co. sold Au Bon Pain to Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Co. for $78 million, in order to focus on the Panera Bread chain. In 2000, Panera Bread moved its headquarters to Richmond Heights, Missouri. In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a 51% stake in Paradise Bakery & Café, a Phoenix metropolitan area-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states, predominantly in the west and southwest, for $21.1 million. The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009. In February 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against the company alleging it failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company's financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects. In February 2011, Panera agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing, settling the lawsuit. In October 2008, Panera Bread expanded into Canada, opening locations in Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Greater Toronto Area. In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood, Missouri offices. The company leased additional space for its headquarters in 2013. In May 2014, Panera unveiled \\"Panera 2.0\\", a series of integrated technologies including new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations, and ultimately, consumption. It includes tablet kiosks with iPads, which the company calls Fast Lane, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter. Customers can also place orders and pay via an app on their smartphone or tablet. In 2017, digital orders accounted for over $1 billion in orders, or 26% of sales. In June 2014, Panera unveiled its official Food Policy which detailed commitments to clean ingredients, transparency, and a positive impact on the food system. This policy outlines the company's values and sets a course for continuous improvement. Panera also made a commitment to remove artificial additives (colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives) on its \\"No No List\\" from the food in its US bakery-cafes by the end of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Panera acquired a majority stake in Tatte Bakery & Cafe, a bakery-cafe concept chain with 16 locations in the Boston area and two in Washington D.C. On March 23, 2016, Panera opened its 2,000th location, a cafe in Elyria, Ohio. In September 2015, many Paradise Bakery & Café locations were rebranded as Panera Bread. In January 2017, Panera announced its food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives. On July 18, 2017, JAB Holding Company acquired the company for $7.16 billion. On November 8, 2017, Panera announced that founder Ron Shaich was stepping down as CEO, and company president Blaine Hurst would take over. Shaich remained chairman. The company also announced the acquisition of Au Bon Pain. In January 2018, the company formed a consulting business to help restaurants remove artificial ingredients from their menus. On April 2, 2018, Brian Krebs reported that the Panera Bread website had leaked between 7 million and 37 million customer records — including names, email and physical addresses, customer loyalty account numbers, birthdays, and the last four digits of the customers' credit card numbers — for at least eight months before the site was taken offline. Panera was notified privately about the vulnerability in August 2017 but failed to fix it until after it was disclosed publicly eight months later. Panera said the leak affected fewer than 10,000 customers and had been fixed. In May 2018, the company introduced delivery services to 897 cities in 43 states, employing its own drivers. According to the company, this created 13,000 jobs. In late July 2020, Tzurit Or made the decision to step down as CEO of Tatte Bakery & Café after a petition was started due to racial insensitivity and racial bias by Or. Panera is majority owner of Tatte. A list of demands by current and former employees included diversifying the company's majority white executive team, increasing salary for all employees, and a new mission statement that includes, \\"fair and equitable treatment for ALL workers at Tatte, especially BIPOC, LGBTQ+, womxn, and differently-abled folx.\\" Social responsibility = Panera Cares: non- profit restaurants = In 2010, the company's nonprofit foundation created Panera Cares, a \\"Pay what you can\\" restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado. It later expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston. Several of their sites served 3,500 customers weekly. The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015. The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016. The original location near St. Louis closed in January 2018. The last location in Boston closed on February 15, 2019. = Free-range eggs = On November 5, 2015, Panera announced that it will use free-range eggs in all of its stores by 2020. Panera also announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu. At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21% cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015. In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler chicken welfare. =Community giving= The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. Panera Bread bakery-cafes donate $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods annually to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by nonprofit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products. = Clean consultations = As of 2016, Panera advertises that their menu is 100% clean of GMOs and artificial preservatives. With their menus continuing to grow, Panera offers counselling to other food services to have a more holistic approach when it comes to purging their menus of artificial ingredients and preservatives.  Lawsuits  =Violation of California Labor Code= In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California's Unfair Competition Law. Panera paid $5 million to settle all claims and denied any wrongdoing. =2011 racial discrimination allegation= In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was eventually fired after repeatedly having a black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location and having \\"pretty young girls\\" be the cashiers, as requested by supervisors. The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of sick leave. Panera said it \\"does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex,\\" and that the plaintiff \\"was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work.\\" The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli, who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit. Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 300 stores in northeast Ohio, western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida. The lawsuit was settled in June 2012. = Peanut butter allergy = In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts store put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being informed that the person receiving the sandwich had a peanut allergy. The plaintiffs charged the company and those employees involved with intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery. The recipient of the sandwich was hospitalized briefly. = 2017 class action for failure to pay overtime wages = In December 2017, former employees filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming that they were not paid overtime wages. = Tabler v. Panera LLC et al = In March 2019, a class action lawsuit was filed by Plaintiff Brianna Tabler in California, accusing Panera of false advertising and fraud. While Panera's former CEO Ron Schaich claimed that Panera's menus continue to be completely void of artificial flavors, sweeteners, and ingredients, Tabler argues against the company's intentional redaction of the fact that their products contain traces of the synthetic biocide glyphosate. In October 2019, Judge Lucy Koh granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Tabler filed an amended complaint in November 2019, to which Panera filed in January 2020 another motion to dismiss. Awards and recognition In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on Bloomberg BusinessWeek's list of \\"Hot Growth Companies\\", earning $38.6 million with a 42.9 percent increase in profits. In a 2008 Health magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America's healthiest fast casual restaurant and one of North America's enemies of obese children. In 2009 and 2012, Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go. Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option, Best Salad, and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations in 2009.

It is the third and final installment in the Rugrats film series as well as the second film in The Wild Thornberrys series. Christine Cavanaugh, the voice of Chuckie Finster, was replaced by Nancy Cartwright. The film was produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Klasky Csupo and released in theaters on June 13, 2003, by Paramount Pictures. The film received largely unfavorable reviews and grossed $55.4 million worldwide, making it the lowest grossing Rugrats film in the trilogy. The film used \\"Odorama,\\" which allowed people to smell odors and aromas from the film using scratch and sniff cards (reminiscent of 1960s Smell-O-Vision), and it was not used again theatrically for eight years, until the release of Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. Plot The Rugrats go on an adventure through the safari. Tommy impersonates Nigel Thornberry, who is his role model and spoofs his nature show. The babies' broadcast is cut short when they come across a tiger and then a crocodile, both of which threaten them. Just as they begin sinking in quicksand and are nearly attacked, this is revealed as only imagination; the babies and their families are about to go on vacation on the Lipschitz cruise ship. When the families arrive at the dock, they miss the Lipschitz cruise. Tommy's father, Stu, has rented a ramshackle boat called the S.S. Nancy which he reveals to be their real mode of transportation, and their real vacation. The families are angered that Stu did not consult them on his plans, and soon the boat is flipped over by a rogue wave during a tropical storm. Everyone is forced to abandon the ship and board a life raft as the ship sinks. Everyone blames Stu for causing all of this and lose hope of being saved. Things start looking up when Angelica sings about having hope on her karaoke machine (which resembles a toy piano) she brought, until Spike's tail accidentally knocks both her Cynthia doll and karaoke machine into the ocean. The next morning, they arrive on a small, seemingly uninhabited island (possibly in Southeast Asia) and Angelica finds her Cynthia doll on the beach. The adults argue about who should be the leader. When it gets out of hand, Betty suggests a test: she draws a circle around the fighting adults and tells everyone to step out of the circle, saying that it is the bad circle. They all step out and say that they all feel better, except Stu, and make Betty the leader after Didi forbids him from volunteering, much to his chagrin. On the opposite side of the island is the famous globe- trotting family the Thornberrys (out to film a clouded leopard). Tommy, Chuckie, and the rest of the kids, except for Angelica, set off to find them, for they suspect they are somewhere on the island. Along the way, Chuckie gets lost and runs into the Thornberry's child Donnie, who steals Chuckie's clothes, forcing Chuckie to wear Donnie's shorts. He laments on looking like a \\"wild boy\\". Meanwhile, Eliza, the gifted Thornberry, is exploring about the jungle with Darwin, her chimpanzee companion and runs into Spike, the Pickles' dog. Since Eliza can talk to animals, Spike (now voiced by Bruce Willis) talks for the first time (although he spoke in Chuckie's dream sequence in the episode \\"In the Dreamtime\\"); he informs her that his babies are lost somewhere on the island. Under the impression that Spike means he is looking for puppies, Eliza (and a reluctant Darwin) agree to help him find them. Following a close encounter with Siri, an angry clouded leopard whom Spike believes to be just a regular domestic cat, they learn that he meant the human babies. Simultaneously, Eliza's father, Nigel, finds the lost babies. He heads in their direction but ends up tumbling down a hill and suffers amnesia after a coconut falls on his head. Angelica (going by \\"Angelitiki, the Island Princess\\") runs into Debbie, the teenage Thornberry, and takes off with Debbie in the Thornberry's all-purpose mobile communication vehicle (commvee). In order to get back faster, Angelica steals the Thornberry's bathysphere, accidentally sinking the commvee in her attempt to pilot it. She finds and retrieves the babies and Nigel. Meanwhile Stu, who has managed to create a working coconut radio, and the other parents run into Donnie, who is still wearing Chuckie's shoes. After chasing him down the beach, they run into Marianne Thornberry, the mother of Eliza and Debbie and the wife of Nigel. Stu's coconut radio picks up the babies, Angelica having accidentally turned on the bathysphere's radio. Angelica and Susie, while fighting for control, have crashed bathysphere at the bottom of the ocean. Nigel hits his head in the crash and regains his memories. With the other parents' help, Marianne then raises the commvee and uses the automatic-retrieval system to rescue Nigel and the babies just as the air runs out. They are reunited with their families and forgive Stu, and everyone finally gets on board the Lipschitz cruise. The Thornberrys join them too, deciding that they should take a vacation, much to Debbie's delight. Spike vows never to lose his babies again. Cast =Main characters from Rugrats= * E. G.

Among the biggest hype this movie received was Bruce Willis voicing Spike, and the use of \\"Odorama\\" cards to enhance the viewing experience, Burger King and Blockbuster released a scratch and sniff piece of cardboard that was to be scratched and sniffed during the run of the movie. There were many complaints, that the only thing that the \\"Odorama\\" cards smelled like was cardboard. The Odorama card was somewhat of an homage to John Waters' (decidedly adult-oriented) film Polyester. Despite the homage, Waters felt he was ripped off and realized that New Line Cinema, the studio that released Polyester, didn't renew the copyright for Odorama. He later said that \\"a cheque would have been an homage\\".Jeff Garlin's film of John Waters' one man show This Filthy World. \\"Odorama\\" cards would later be released with the DVD release of the movie. Early trailers for the film give the title The Rugrats Meet The Wild Thornberrys. Release During its initial theatrical run, Rugrats Go Wild was presented in \\"Smell-O-Vision\\". During certain scenes in the movie, an icon would pop up on screen with an item inside of it (example: a smelly shoe). When this happened, audience members would smell a scratch-and-sniff card (which were handed out at the box office) with the corresponding image. =Rating= Rugrats Go Wild is the only Rugrats film to receive a PG rating by the MPAA. =Home video= The film was released on videocassette and DVD on December 16, 2003. Most VHS copies included a \\"Smell- O-Vision\\" scratch-and-sniff card, as did most initial run DVDs. Later copies of the DVD did not include additional cards, but did retain the option to view the film with the scratch-and-sniff icons on. The film is also available as a part of the Rugrats 3-disc set of all three films, as well as a double feature 2-disc set that also included The Rugrats Movie. The film was re-released on DVD on August 29, 2017. Reception =Box office= The film grossed $39.4 million domestically and $55.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $25 million. The film earned less than each of the other two Rugrats films. The film opened at #4 with Finding Nemo at the #1 spot. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film, has a 39% approval rating based on 88 reviews, with an average score of 5.02/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The Rugrats franchise has gone from fresh to formulaic.\\" Metacritic gives the movie a score of 38/100 based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Neil Smith at the BBC gave the film 2 out of 5. Film4 said the film wasn't that as bad as other reviews suggested but \\"it just doesn't hold a candle to 2002's charming and superior The Wild Thornberrys Movie\\".

It was named after its inventor, Ulrich Salchow, in 1909. The salchow is accomplished with a takeoff from the back inside edge of one foot and a landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. It is \\"usually the first jump that skaters learn to double, and the first or second to triple\\".Kestnbaum, p. 284 Timing is critical because both the takeoff and landing must be on the backward edge. A salchow is deemed cheated if the skate blade starts to turn forward before the takeoff, or if it has not turned completely backward when the skater lands back on the ice. History The salchow jump is an edge jump in the sport of figure skating. It was named after its inventor, Swedish world champion Ulrich Salchow in 1909.Media Guide, p. 13Hines, p. 193 According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, American skater Theresa Weld \\"received reprimands\\" at the 1920 Olympics \\"for performing a single salchow jump because her skirt would fly up to her knees, creating an image deemed too risque\\".Kestnbaum, p. 92 In competitions, the base value of a single salchow is 0.40; the base value of a double salchow is 1.30; the base value of a triple salchow is 4.30; and the base value of a quadruple salchow is 9.70. =Firsts= Japanese figure skater Miki Ando (2009) Cecilia Colledge from Great Britain was the first woman to complete a double jump, the salchow, in competition, at the 1936 European Championships.Hines, p. xxiv The first triple salchow by a male skater was completed by American Robbie Robertson at the 1955 World Championships. According to the ISU, the first triple salchow completed by a woman skater is \\"not definitely established\\".Media guide, p. 14 The ISU also stated that Canadian Petra Burka was given credit for a triple salchow at both the 1962 Canadian Championships and the 1965 World Championships, but \\"a report\\" from the 1961 European Championships gave credit to Austrian Helli Sengstschmid and Jana Mrazkova from Czechoslovakia. Timothy Goebel from the U.S. was the first man to perform a quadruple salchow in competition, at the 1997-1998 Junior Grand Prix final. Miki Ando from Japan was the first woman to complete a quadruple salchow, at the 2002-2003 Junior Grand Prix final. Russian Ilia Klimkin was the first male skater to complete a quadruple salchow in combination, with a quadruple toe loop jump, at the Nebelhorn Trophy in 1999. Alexandra Trusova, also from Russia, was the first woman skater to complete a quadruple salchow in combination, also with a quadruple toe loop, at the 2018 World Junior Championships. Timothy Goebel was the first skater to complete three quadruples, two quadruple salchows in combination with the triple and quadruple toe loop jump. American Nathan Chen was the first skater to complete four quadruple jumps in the same program: two quadruple salchows, one in combination with the double toe, and the quadruple toe in combination with the double toe, and the quadruple toe, at the U.S. Championships in 2016. Chen was also the first skater to complete five quadruple jumps in the same program: the quadruple salchow, the quadruple lutz jump in combination with the triple toe, the quadruple flip jump, the quadruple toe in combination with the double toe and double loop, and the quadruple toe, at the 2017 U.S. Championships and the 2017 Four Continents Championships. American pair skaters Tiffany Vise and Derek Trent were the first to complete a throw quadruple salchow, at the 2007 Trophee Eric Bompard.Media guide, p. 15 Execution According to the ISU, the salchow jump is an edge jump. Its takeoff is made from the back inside edge of one foot and its landing is made on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. The skater enters into the jump with a backward approach, launches it using his or her inside edge, and lands on the opposite outside edge. The free leg is extended behind the skater and swings toward the front as he or she springs into the air while, at the same time, drawing in his or her arms. Skaters do not have to draw in their arms or free leg close to their bodies while performing the single salchow because bringing the free side of their bodies forward and around the opposite side of their bodies after they turn towards the back, is enough to produce the necessary rotation. The rotation in the air, with respect to a fixed point, is slightly less than 360 degrees because the takeoff edge curves in the same direction as the rotation in the air. When a skater pulls the arms into his or her body and/or brings his or her free leg inward, more rotations can be performed; for this reason, the salchow is \\"usually the first jump that skaters learn to double, and the first or second to triple\\". As U.S. Figure Skating states, however, \\"timing is critical\\" because both the takeoff and landing must be on the backward edge. A salchow is deemed cheated if the skate blade starts to turn forward before the takeoff, or if it has not turned completely backward when the skater lands back on the ice.

After the release of the group's fourth album in 1999, an extended tour followed. This was probably one of the most exciting, yet demanding times for the group. The demand also gave way to a trio becoming a duet. =2001–present= However, 2001, the sibling duo, headed for the studio to produce what would be their first brother and sister project. If We Pray was released early fall 2001. However, in 2002, because of transitions in the label, Anointed requested to be released from their deal and they and Word records amicably parted ways. Following this, the band was signed on to the Sony Urban label and Now Is The Time was released on April 5, 2005.Music Anointed Both Dadra and Steve are currently leading worship and Pastoring at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas.

The band first came into the national spotlight with their 2× platinum debut album Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich, and one of its singles, \\"Heaven,\\" reached No. 1 in Rolling Stone and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band's success continued in the early 1990s with the double platinum album Cherry Pie which provided the hit album titled song and music video. Following the critically acclaimed gold album Dog Eat Dog the band started to experience frequent changes to the line-up and despite the drop in popularity with the arrival of grunge, they released Ultraphobic in 1995 and a successful greatest hits album in 1996. The band also changed their musical direction with the release of the grunge influenced Belly to Belly in 1996, but returned to their roots very quickly by the end of the decade. The band experienced highs and lows in the 2000s with successful tours, a new covers album Under the Influence, lead singer Jani Lane leaving, a brand new Born Again album with new singer Jaime St. James and a brief reunion of the original line up. Into the new decade former lead singer and main songwriter Jani Lane died. After over 30 years, the band is still recording music and performing, now with ex-Lynch Mob lead vocalist Robert Mason. History =Early years (1984–1987)= Warrant was formed in 1984 by guitarist Erik Turner who had previously been a member of Knightmare II (along with future Warrant guitarist Joey Allen). The first line up included lead vocalist Adam Shore, drummer Max Asher (born Max Mazursky/Masursky), guitarist Josh Lewis (born Josh Cohen), and bassist Chris Vincent, who was quickly replaced by Jerry Dixon. The band gigged hard in California opening for Hurricane, Ted Nugent, Stryper and Black 'n Blue among others. In September 1986, Shore and Asher quit to create Hot Wheelz. Later that month Erik Turner was at a gig watching a band called Plain Jane who had become a regular feature in the Los Angeles club circuit and he was impressed by the band's songwriting and vocal performance, and invited lead singer Jani Lane and drummer Steven Sweet (born Steven Chamberlin/Chamberlain) to jam with his band at Hollywood's db Sound in September 1986. Lane and Sweet, along with guitarist Joey Allen (born Joey Cagle), who replaced Lewis, completed the revamped lineup in 1987. The recruitment of Lane proved pivotal in the band's future, with the singer quickly assuming the role of songwriter. After achieving fame on the Los Angeles club scene, the band recorded a demo tape in September 1987 for Paisley Park Records, a record label owned by musician Prince. With major labels taking an interest and after recording tracks for A&M; Records the band also put in a showing on the movie soundtrack to Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Eventually it was announced that Columbia had snapped up the band. Lane immediately spent his advance on a black Corvette which he promptly crashed. Warrant opened their campaign in September billed with D'MOLLS followed by dates with Britny Fox. The label immediately arranged for them to work with the in demand Beau Hill as producer on what would become the band's debut album. =Peak of popularity (1988–1993)= In January 1988, Warrant signed a contract with Columbia Records, and in April they began recording their debut album Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich. The album was released January 31, 1989, and was a significant success charting at number 10 on the Billboard 200. The album spawned four hit singles on the US charts: the No. 2 power ballad \\"Heaven\\", the No. 20 Power Ballad \\"Sometimes She Cries\\", the No. 27 rock anthem \\"Down Boys\\", which is now Warrant's alias, and \\"Big Talk\\", which reached No. 30. Image-wise, Warrant became a huge hit instantly and slotted right into the trend for big-haired, leather-wearing hard rock bands, and their music videos made much of their look. The band toured with Paul Stanley, Poison, Mötley Crüe, Queensrÿche, Cinderella and Kingdom Come, alongside copious MTV coverage. The band was featured in Screamer Magazine several times before finally landing the cover of its June 1989 issue. Warrant: Live – Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich which was the first Warrant video album was released in 1990 on VHS and Laserdisc, featuring the band performing live in concert. The video was certified platinum The band's momentum at this point carried them to further success with the much anticipated second album Cherry Pie in 1990. Once more produced by Beau Hill, the album's title track was released as the first single and immediately propelled itself to a top 10 placing in the American singles chart. The album had tentatively been titled 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' after the original opening track. However, the label wanted an 'anthem' track, resulting in Lane coming up with \\"Cherry Pie\\" and the track becoming not only the lead cut but the album's title track. The video for the song employed model actress Bobbie Brown, whom Lane would later marry. The album charted at No. 7 on The Billboard 200 and featured guest appearances by Poison's C.C. DeVille, Danger Danger's Bruno Ravel and Steve West, and Fiona. The album, which spawned the hit singles \\"Cherry Pie\\" (Featured in Guitar Hero II), \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" (the acoustic intro was performed by Eric Oswald – Jani's brother), \\"Blind Faith\\" and \\"I Saw Red\\" which also reached the Top Ten in the United States, and the album went on to sell three million copies. The release of \\"Cherry Pie\\" was followed by a world tour with Poison, which ended in January 1991 after a conflict between the two bands over stage room. The band's European tour with David Lee Roth was cut short after Lane fractured several ribs in a stage dive in Birmingham, England. Warrant soon returned to touring, headlining shows in America on their 'Blood, Sweat And Beers' tour, supported by FireHouse and Trixter. The band released their second video album Cherry Pie: Quality You Can Taste in 1991. The video features backstage interviews, concert clips including a preview of the band's next album and all the music videos from Cherry Pie. In 1992, Warrant released their third album the critically acclaimed Dog Eat Dog. The record achieved only moderate commercial success compared with the first two albums, but still sold over 500,000 copies reaching Gold status and charting at No. 25 on the US charts. While the record suffered poor sales performance in America, it was still considered as Warrant's strongest record, and a favorite among many devoted fans. The band snared a European touring slot, playing a number of shows on the \\"Monsters Of Rock\\" festival, headlined by Iron Maiden. The album featured the singles \\"Machine Gun\\", \\"The Bitter Pill\\" and \\"The Hole in my Wall\\". Warrant also cut two tracks for the Gladiator movie in a cover version of Queen's anthem \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"The Power\\". =Changing Times (1994–1999)= The 1990s were characterized by frequent changes to the band's line-up. Following their Dog Eat Dog world tour Lane temporarily left the band to start a solo career and the band was then dropped by Columbia, following the arrival of grunge and the death of Warrant's long-time manager Tom Hulett. In September 1993, Lane returned to the band and a short U.S. club tour commenced. In May 1994, guitarist Allen left Warrant and was followed by drummer Sweet in the following month. In November 1994, former Kingdom Come member, Rick Steier replaced Allen on guitar and fellow Kingdom Come alumnus James Kottak replaced Sweet on drums. Shortly thereafter, a new record deal was signed with Tom Lipsky of CMC Records in September 1994. A Japanese deal was signed with Pony Canyon Records at the same time. The band's fourth album Ultraphobic was released in March 1995 and, although critically acclaimed, was not as successful as its predecessors. The new album (produced by a returning Beau Hill) saw Warrant acknowledging the grunge phenomenon with a record that openly admitted to a Seattle influence, although was still a natural progression from the hard edged Dog Eat Dog. The album featured the singles \\"Family Picnic\\", \\"Followed\\" and the ballad \\"Stronger Now\\" and the band went on tour again, touring America, Japan and Europe. Drummer Kottak left the band in March 1996 and was replaced by Bobby Borg, formerly of Beggars & Thieves. The Best Of Warrant was the band's first compilation album released in 1996 which was good timing and sold well, featuring all of the hits from previous albums. Adopting the official handle of WARRANT 96 (in order to signify the group's new musical direction), the group came up with their fifth studio album, the grunge infested Belly to Belly in October 1996. The record dispensed with the melodic rock niceties of previous works. The record was described by guitarist Steier as a \\"concept album\\" that follows a rags-to-riches-to-rags storyline concerning fame, fortune and the examination of one's value system once the spotlight fades. Warrant released their first live compilation Warrant Live 86-97 in July 1997. It was recorded live at Harpos Concert Theatre, Detroit, Michigan on November 22, 1996. Warrant toured in 1997 opening for Alice Cooper in America alongside label mates Dokken and Slaughter. In October 1997, drummer Borg left the band, and was briefly replaced by touring drummer Vikki Foxx. The band was featured on the Rock Never Stops Tour in 1998. In 1999 Warrant released Greatest & Latest album featuring new re-recorded versions of some their classic songs and three new tracks. =Lane leaves, solo albums, new singer (2000–2007)= Guitarist Steier and keyboardist Danny Wagner (the latter of whom also performed drums) left the band in January 2000. Keri Kelli replaced Steier on guitars as a touring member and Mike Fasano became the newest in a long line of drummers. Keri Kelli and Mike Fasano had previously played together in Dad's Porno Mag. In August 2000, Kelli toured with Slash's Snakepit. Warrant's next record was an album of cover versions, Under the Influence, released in May 2001, also featuring two new original tracks: \\"Subhuman\\" and \\"Face\\" Produced by Jerry Dixon. The band toured with Poison again in the summer of 2001, but the tour was cut short due to back injuries sustained by Poison bassist Bobby Dall. Lane released his official debut solo album, Back Down to One, in 2002 through Z Records. It carried a \\"power pop\\" sound which was more closely aligned with the sound of Warrant than his unreleased Jabberwocky project. Shortly after the album's release Lane was admitted to a rehab center for alcohol and drug-related exhaustion. The band again featured on the Rock Never Stops Tour in 2003 and in April 2003, Warrant replaced drummer Fasano with Kevan Phares. Following rehab, Lane officially quit Warrant again in January 2004. After a few appearances on tribute compilations, Lane attempted to restart his own version of Warrant which would be stopped by legal action from his former bandmates. Mike Fasano was briefly rehired in early 2004, before Steven Sweet rejoined the band. Joey Allen also rejoined in February 2004 and Lane was replaced with former Black N' Blue vocalist Jaime St. James. Warrant released their seventh studio album entitled Born Again on February 4, 2006, with producer and engineer Pat Regan, who has previously worked with Ace Frehley, Deep Purple, Mr. Big and L.A. Guns. Music Videos were shot for all the songs on Born Again including the singles \\"Bourbon County Line\\" and \\"Dirty Jack\\", they appear on the DVD \\"Born Again: Delvis Video Diaries\\" along with behind the scenes footage, on tour clips and the making of the album. This was the first album to not feature Lane on lead vocals. On July 14, 2007, Warrant performed at the hard rock festival Rocklahoma. =Original lineup reunion (2008)= In January 2008, the band's agent, The William Morris Agency issued a new photograph of the band with Lane prominently featured, confirming his return to the band for the 20 year anniversary. This version of the band was scheduled to play at Rocklahoma 2008. In March 2008, Warrant announced on its official website that it would co-headline with Cinderella on a summer reunion tour after Rocklahoma 2008. Ultimately, the tour was canceled after Cinderella singer Tom Keifer's left vocal cord hemorrhaged, making it impossible for him to sing in the immediate future. They had several shows outside of the Cinderella tour including 2 dates in Canada, Rocklahoma, and several in August. On September 5, 2008, Jani Lane left Warrant and Robert Mason (ex-Lynch Mob) took over vocals. A statement from the band, published by Blabbermouth.net, said that: On September 10, Rita Wilde's Rock Report confirmed that Jani Lane was out of Warrant due to song writing disagreements, but offered no further details on replacements or the band's future. Mason eventually agreed not only to finish the tour but also to become a permanent member of the band. A compilation reunion DVD was released in late 2008 titled They Came From Hollywood. =Post Jani Lane (2009–2011)= In December 2010, founding members, Erik Turner and Jerry Dixon appeared with longtime friend David Castagno on RadioScreamer to discuss Warrant's long and successful career as well as the band's next album plans. On January 27, 2011, Joey Allen announced that the bass and drums for fourteen songs for Warrant's next album had been completed, with the rhythm guitar parts for seven also completed. The release of the new album, titled Rockaholic, on May 13, 2011 in Europe and May 17, 2011 in North America was confirmed by Frontiers Records. It subsequently peaked at number 22 on the Billboard Top Hard Rock Albums chart. The album features two new music videos for the singles: \\"Life's a Song\\" and \\"Home\\". The Rockaholic Tour of Canada and the US with label mates Whitesnake as well as Cinderella and fellow Sunset Strip Kings Poison, had Warrant playing over 50 dates in support of the album. =Death of Jani Lane (2011)= On Thursday evening, August 11, 2011, it was announced by the Los Angeles Police Department, that Jani Lane, 47, former lead singer (1986–04, 2008), had been found dead. It was confirmed that Lane was officially pronounced dead by fire department personnel who responded to a call shortly before 5:30 p.m. at a Comfort Inn hotel on the 20100 block of Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills, California. Lane died of acute alcohol poisoning. A public memorial concert for the late Jani Lane – with performances by fellow metal rock bands, including Great White, Slammin' Gladys, Quiet Riot and L.A. Guns — was held on Monday, August 29, 2011 at the Key Club in Hollywood, California. =Recent events (2012–present)= Warrant went on tour in 2012 with Firehouse and Trixter for the twenty-first anniversary of the Cherry Pie album. In 2016, Warrant guitarist Allen announced that the band intends to enter a recording studio in the fall (possibly in Nashville or Los Angeles) to begin its follow up to 2011's Rockaholic. The band already had nine new songs fully demoed and another 20 ideas “floating around”. On May 12, 2017, Warrant released their ninth studio album titled \\"Louder Harder Faster\\". The album features a remake of the classic Merle Haggard song \\"I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink\\" as the first single and the 'Professional Bull Riders' new \\"party anthem\\". The official video premiered at an official kickoff party at St Louis in Ballpark Village on February 25, accompanied by a live performance. The clip was filmed in Anaheim.2017 The band also released the single and music video for the album's title track \\"Louder Harder Faster\\" on May 4, 2017.2017 The album charted at #19 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart.

The concertmaster (from the German Konzertmeister) is the leader of the first violin section in an orchestra (or clarinet, oboe, flute in a concert band) and the instrument-playing leader of the orchestra. After the conductor, the concertmaster is the second-most significant leader in an orchestra, symphonic band or other musical ensemble. Another common term in the U.S. is \\"first chair.\\" In the U.K., the term commonly used is \\"leader.\\"  Orchestra  In an orchestra, the concertmaster is the leader of the first violin section. There is another violin section, the second violins, led by the principal second violin. Any violin solo in an orchestral work is played by the concertmaster (except in the case of a concerto, in which case a guest soloist usually plays). It is usually required that the concertmaster be the most skilled musician in the section, experienced at learning music quickly, counting rests accurately and leading the rest of the string section by their playing and bow gestures. The concertmaster sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience, in what is called the \\"first chair,\\" \\"first [music] stand\\" or outside of the US \\"first desk.\\" The concertmaster makes decisions regarding bowing and other technical details of violin playing for the violins, and sometimes all of the string players. They lead the orchestra in tuning before concerts and rehearsals, and other technical aspects of orchestra management. Leading the orchestral tuning is not a mere formality; if the concertmaster believes that a section is not adequately tuned, they will signal to the oboe player to play another \\"A.\\" Several larger orchestras have one or more assistant concertmasters, who lead the orchestra in the concertmaster's absence. The concertmaster, along with the conductor and section principals, will normally participate in the auditions of important musicians (e.g., principal players) in the orchestra.  Other large ensembles  In a standard concert band, the concertmaster is the principal clarinet, oboe, or flute and leads the ensemble's tuning. The first-chair clarinet concertmaster will, in common practice, play all solos for their instrument. Often the lead flautist will receive similar responsibilities to the clarinet concertmaster, depending on several factors such as age, skill and time spent in the ensemble. The concertmaster will, in both orchestral and wind band settings, also coordinate with other principals and section leaders, in most cases being their senior in terms of group pecking order. In brass bands, the role of concertmaster is often filled by the principal solo cornet or trumpet.  Duties  The duties and tasks of the concertmaster are many. Primarily, they act as the conduit between conductor and orchestra and are accountable to both parties. One of the principal tasks of the concertmaster is to provide bowings for the 1st violins prior to rehearsal. This entails a great knowledge of historical playing styles in addition to complete idiomatic understanding of the mechanics of string playing. Section leaders among the other strings will base their bowings on those of the concertmaster and these section leaders (called principals) may confer during rehearsal in order to ensure unity and cohesion of execution between the string sections. Ensemble cohesion emanates directly from the contact and connection between these vital front desk positions. The concertmaster assumes responsibility for the tone and execution of the entire section of 1st violins, in addition to performing any solo passages that occur in a given piece. Another primary duty of the concertmaster is to translate instructions from the conductor into specific technical language for the strings. Some conductors prefer to speak more broadly and defer to the concertmaster on such matters out of respect for the musicians who are expert specialists while the conductor is, often (unless he or she is a string player), a generalist. Full-time professional orchestras work with several conductors through the course of a regular season. Accordingly, while the conductor may change week to week or month to month, the concertmaster lends a sense of stable and constant leadership day to day. While the impetus for the orchestra to play is given by the conductor's gestures, oftentimes for reasons of precision, the orchestra will actually follow the bow of the concertmaster as their cue to play. This is because the conductor's gestures exist in the abstract whereas the concertmaster produces sound along with their fellow musicians. Further, the idiosyncratic technique of some conductors can make it difficult for the orchestra to enter together. Yet another duty of the concertmaster is to maintain a sense of decorum during rehearsals by setting a personal example and by monitoring the room to ensure all members of the orchestra are being cooperative. It is more appropriate for the concertmaster to ask for quiet if there is a bit of chatter than it is for a guest conductor unfamiliar with the orchestra. In performances given in America and/or featuring American or British orchestras, the concertmaster will usually walk onstage individually after the rest of the orchestra is seated, and bow and receive applause before the conductor appears. In continental European orchestras, this practice is uncommon. There, the concertmaster usually walks onstage with the rest of the orchestra. As the representative of the orchestra, the concertmaster will usually shake hands with the conductor at the beginning or end of a concert as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.

He also played on Gary Numan's Dance album in 1981 and was the main guitarist on Numan's 1982 tour. He played on Sinéad O'Connor's first album The Lion and the Cobra in 1987 (on which he co-wrote one of the songs). Dean continued to work on projects with Steve Jansen, Richard Barbieri and Mick Karn such as a 1995 compilation album and a number of other works on their Medium Productions label. His work with other artists includes the following: Vivabeat Vivabeat (supported by Peter Gabriel) combined the influences of 70s British art-rock with the kind of lush technopop performed by David Bowie, Roxy Music and Sparks. The band was the first American band signed to Charisma Records. The band had a worldwide hit with the track \\"Man From China\\" from their debut album Party in the War Zone. Dean played on the follow-up single, \\"The House is Burning (But There's No One Home)\\", which was featured on the band's self- titled EP. The \\"House is Burning\\" song and video (also featuring Dean) appeared in Brian DePalma's movie Body Double. In 2001 a 'best of' Vivabeat album titled The Good Life was released, with Dean's work on several tracks. Illustrated Man Dean formed Illustrated Man (1984) with Hugo Burnham (ex- Gang of Four), Roger Mason (Numan and others) and Australian singer/bassist Philip Foxman but their commercial success was limited. =The Slow Club's World of Wonders= Rob Dean contributed to this Australian band (1990) =Jansen, Barbieri, Karn= Beginning to Melt''' This 1993 album features Rob Dean and ex-members of Japan. Little has been heard of Rob Dean as a musician since. The occasional demo tapes from the eighties have surfaced for a range of projects (known as 'The Lost Tapes') where Dean experimented with electronica (with Roger Mason), his trademark guitar sounds and even acoustic tracks with vocals. Present day Dean's principal activity now is as a professional ornithology writer and artist on the birds of Central America. He lives in Monteverde, Costa Rica, and, now known as Robert Dean, has established a reputation as an expert on the region's birdlife. In 2007 Dean collaborated as illustrator on a field guide (along with author Richard Garrigues), entitled The Birds of Costa Rica: A Field Guide, and in 2010 (with author George Angehr) on The Birds of Panama: A Field Guide. He has been reported as occasionally playing guitar with local bands including Monteverde's rock band Chanchos de Monte, fronted by Alan Masters. More recently Robert has formed a group named 'Light of Day' with Isaac Moraga and their debut album Dimensions was completed in 2019 with UK/Europe/Latin America release expected in 2020. In addition, a Spanish language e.p. featuring alternate versions of several album tracks is also being prepared for release in Costa Rica in 2020.

Usually medial angulation of both lower limb bones (femur and tibia) is involved. Causes If a child is sickly, either with rickets or any other ailment that prevents ossification of the bones, or is improperly fed, the bowed condition may persist. Thus the chief cause of this deformity is rickets. Skeletal problems, infection, and tumors can also affect the growth of the leg, sometimes giving rise to a one-sided bow-leggedness. The remaining causes are occupational, especially among jockeys, and from physical trauma, the condition being very likely to supervene after accidents involving the condyles of the femur. =Childhood= Children until the age of 3 to 4 have a degree of genu varum. The child sits with the soles of the feet facing one another; the tibia and femur are curved outwards; and, if the limbs are extended, although the ankles are in contact, there is a distinct space between the knee-joints. During the first year of life, a gradual change takes place. The knee-joints approach one another; the femur slopes downward and inward towards the knee joints; the tibia become straight; and the sole of the foot faces almost directly downwards. While these changes are occurring, the bones, which at first consist principally of cartilage, are gradually becoming ossified. By the time a normal child begins to walk, the lower limbs are prepared, both by their general direction and by the rigidity of the bones which form them, to support the weight of the body. =Rickets= Nutritional rickets is an important cause of childhood genu varum or bow legs in some parts of the world. Nutritional rickets is due to unhealthy life style habits as insufficient exposure to sun light which is the main source of vitamin D. Insufficient dietary intake of calcium is another contributing factor. Rickets may also have genetic causes, occasionally called resistant rickets. Rickets usually causes bone deformities in all four extremities. Genu varum may resolve spontaneously with modification of life style activities or after receiving medical treatment. Some deformities do not correct spontaneously and need surgical intervention especially if they are severe and causing gait difficulties. The main surgical modality used to treat genu varum arising from rickets is guided growth surgery, also known as growth modulation surgery. =Blount's disease= Blount's disease is a deformity in the legs, mostly from the knees to the ankles. The affected bone curves in or out and forms the usual \\"archers bow\\" which can also be called bow-legs. There are two types of Blount's disease. The first type is Infantile: this means that children under four are diagnosed with this disease. Blount's disease in this age is very risky because sometimes it is not detected and it passes to the second type of Blount's disease. The second type of Blount's disease is found mostly in older children and in teenagers, sometimes in one leg and sometimes in both; the patient's age determines how severe the diagnosis is. =Osteochondrodysplasia= Osteochondrodysplasia are a diverse group of genetic bone diseases or genetic skeletal dysplasias that manifest in generalized bone deformities involving the extremities and the spine. Bow legs or genu varum is one of these deformities. The characteristic bone X-ray survey findings are important to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis Hip- knee-ankle angle. On projectional radiography, the degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the hip-knee-ankle angle, which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint. It is normally between 1.0° and 1.5° of varus in adults. Normal ranges are different in children. File:Hip-knee-ankle angle by age.pngHip-knee-ankle angle by age, with 95% prediction interval. Treatment Valgus osteotomy. The black line is the mechanical axis. This process may be done to correct a varus deformity. Generally, no treatment is required for idiopathic presentation as it is a normal anatomical variant in young children. Treatment is indicated when it persists beyond 3 and a half years old. In the case of unilateral presentation or progressive worsening of the curvature, when caused by rickets, the most important thing is to treat the constitutional disease, at the same time instructing the care-giver never to place the child on its feet. In many cases this is quite sufficient in itself to effect a cure, but matters can be hastened somewhat by applying splints. When the deformity arises in older patients, either from trauma or occupation, the only permanent treatment is surgery, but orthopaedic bracing can provide relief. =Rickets= Rickets usually causes bone deformities in all four extremities. Genu varum may resolve spontaneously with modification of life style activities or after receiving medical treatment. Some deformities do not correct spontaneously and need surgical intervention especially if they are severe and causing gait difficulties. The main surgical modality used to treat genu varum arising from rickets is guided growth surgery, also known as growth modulation surgery. =Blount's disease= Treatment for children with Blount's disease is typically braces but surgery may also be necessary. In children guided growth surgery is used to gradually correct/straighten the bow legs. For teenagers osteotomy or bone cutting is often used to correct the bone deformity. The operation consists of removing a piece of tibia, breaking the fibula and straightening out the bone; there is also a choice of elongating the legs. If not treated early enough, the condition worsens quickly. =Osteochondrodysplasia= Guided growth surgery in children is widely used to achieve gradual correction of knee deformities arising from Osteochondrodysplasia including genu varum. Yet, this treatment is associated with a high incidence of recurrence and repeated surgeries may be needed to maintain proper bone alignment. Prognosis In most cases persisting after childhood, there is little or no effect on the ability to walk. Due to uneven stress and wear on the knees, however, even milder manifestations can see an accelerated onset of arthritis.

A distinctive feature of the view from the Connecticut River, the Goodspeed Opera House is the birthplace of some of the world's most famous musicals, including Annie, Man of La Mancha and Shenandoah.  Goodspeed Opera House  The Opera House was originally built by a local merchant and banker, William Goodspeed. Construction began in 1876 and finished in 1877. Despite the name, it was not in fact an opera house, but rather a venue for presenting plays. Its first play, Charles II, opened on October 24, 1877. After William Goodspeed's death, the opera house fell into disrepair, facing a series of less glamorous uses—from a militia base during World War I to a general store and a Department of Transportation storage facility. The building is unique for a theater. The theater itself is actually located on the top two floors of the building making for interesting and sometimes difficult scenery and show load-ins. Scenery is loaded-in from the dock area up a vacant elevator shaft that is now outfitted with a winch system to haul the scenery up to the stage level. Much care has to be taken in order to get the scenery up the shaft without scratching or ruining the scenery. One story told around Goodspeed is that while loading in the scenery for Annie's original pre-Broadway run, a strong gust of wind took a large piece of scenery out of the hands of the loaders and blew it into the Connecticut River.  Goodspeed Musicals  Goodspeed Musicals was formed in 1959 by a group of concerned citizens after the state of Connecticut had condemned the building. The state agreed to sell the building to the group for one dollar, provided they acquire enough funding to restore and maintain it. The restoration project took nearly four years, and the Goodspeed Opera House was rededicated on June 8, 1963. The first performance in the new opera house was Oh, Lady! Lady! Under the direction of Michael P. Price from 1968 to 2014, and Michael Gennaro since 2014, Goodspeed Musicals has sent 19 productions to Broadway. Goodspeed productions have won more than a dozen Tony Awards, while Goodspeed Musicals itself has won two special Tonys, one for outstanding contributions to American Musicals and the other for outstanding achievement by a regional theatre. In 1984, Goodspeed Musicals added a second performance venue—the Norma Terris Theatre—in nearby Chester, Connecticut. While the main stage presents a mixture of revivals and new musicals as part of its 3 production season, The Norma Terris also presents three new musicals each season. Several original plays debuted there or at the opera house before going on to Broadway and winning Tony Awards. In addition to the two theaters, Goodspeed Musicals pursues its mission through the Max Showalter Center for Education in Musical Theatre, which offers internships and new writers' residency programs, as well as the Scherer Library of Musical Theatre, which houses the largest musical theatre research facility in the United States. Goodspeed Musicals has also built state-of-the-art production facilities including scenery shops, costume shops and a large costume storage facility. Critic fellows from the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, CT travel to the Goodspeed each summer to practice reviewing full productions. Tours of many of the Goodspeed facilities can be scheduled in advance for a small fee. Tickets to the opera house or theatre productions should be ordered in advance as most performances in the relatively small theater sell-out quickly.

Dr. Azahari bin Husin (14 September 1957 – 9 November 2005), also Azahari Husin, Azhari Husin, was a Malaysian who was believed to be the technical mastermind behind the 2002 Bali bombing. He was killed in a police raid on his hideout in Indonesia in 2005. He was nicknamed the \\"Demolition Man\\". History He received extensive bomb training in Afghanistan. He authored the JI bomb manual, used in the Bali bombing and the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing. He also planned the 2004 Jakarta embassy bombing and was implicated in the 2005 Bali bombings. Prior to his death, he was one of the most wanted men in Indonesia along with Noordin Mohammed Top. In July 2004, Husin and Noordin narrowly escaped a police raid on a rented house west of Jakarta, where forensic experts later found traces of explosives used in the embassy bombing. Neighbours described both as reclusive men who left the property only to pray at a nearby mosque; and they said that before the bombing, they saw the duo loading heavy boxes into a white delivery van which is the same type used in that attack. Before the Marriott Hotel bombing, Husin is known to have stayed with Asmar Latin Sani, the suspected Marriott suicide bomber, at his home in Bengkulu on the island of Sumatra. Both men were close associates of Jemaah Islamiyah's former operational chief, Riduan Isamuddin (better known as Hambali), who was captured in Thailand in 2003. Death On 9 November 2005, Indonesian police, acting on a tip-off, located Husin. They conducted a raid on one of his hideouts in Batu, near Malang in East Java with Detachment 88 operators sent to assist regular police officers. Three suspected jihadist terrorists barricaded themselves inside a house and they put up stiff resistance, throwing grenades and firing bullets at the police outside. This was followed by a series of explosions, one of which was a suicide blast by his assistant setting off his bomb vest.Gatra.Com Police identified the intact corpse of Azahari, with a bullet wound in his chest.Chew, Amy (10 November 2005). \\"Azahari Dead\\".

He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin and Walter Weir, and unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1967. The son of David McLean, he was born and raised in Dauphin, Manitoba, and received a B.A. and an LL.B. from the University of Saskatchewan. McLean came down with tuberculosis before he entered service in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1945, and served as Mayor of Dauphin from 1955 to 1958. In 1958, McLean was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the riding of Dauphin. A Progressive Conservative, McLean was appointed Minister of Education in the minority government of Dufferin Roblin. He retained this position after Roblin's Tories won a majority government in 1959, and was responsible for overseeing the consolidation of several school boards. On 9 December 1963, McLean was shifted to the office of Attorney-General. He held this position until 22 July 1966, when he was appointed Provincial Secretary and Minister of Public Works. Ideologically, McLean was a representative of the Progressive Conservative Party's right wing, and had difficulty accepting some of Dufferin Roblin's more innovative policies (for instance, \\"shared services\\" for separate schools). When Roblin moved to federal politics in 1967, McLean was one of four candidates who sought to replace him. He placed third on the first ballot with 87 votes, and was eliminated on the second after falling to 73. Most of his supporters voted for Weir, the winning candidate, on the third and final ballot. Weir initially kept McLean as Provincial Secretary and Public Works Minister, but shifted him to the Ministry of Transportation on 24 September 1968. Weir's Tories were defeated by Edward Schreyer's New Democrats in 1969. McLean was personally defeated in by New Democrat Peter Burtniak, after a recount, by 41 votes. He did not return to provincial politics after this. After leaving politics, he served as a judge in Saskatchewan, retiring in 1983. McLean died at home in Dauphin in 1996.

People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160 (1941), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case where a California law prohibiting the bringing of a non-resident \\"indigent person\\" into the state was struck down as unconstitutional. The so-called, \\"anti-Okie\\" law made it a misdemeanor to bring into California \\"any indigent person who is not a resident of the State, knowing him to be an indigent person\\". Edwards was a Californian who had driven to Texas and returned with his unemployed brother-in-law. He was tried, convicted and given a six-month suspended sentence. On appeal from the Superior Court of Yuba County, the Supreme Court unanimously vacated the verdict and declared the law unconstitutional, as violating the Constitution's Commerce Clause. Justice Byrnes wrote the majority opinion. In concurring opinions, Justices Douglas joined by Justices Black and Murphy, and Justice Jackson held that the law violated the Privileges or Immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.. Background Edwards was a citizen of the United States and a Californian resident. In December 1939, he left his home in Marysville for Spur, Texas, with the intent of picking up his brother-in-law, Frank Duncan, a citizen of the US and of Texas, and returning home to California with Duncan. During the course of his trip, Edwards was made aware of the fact that Duncan was unemployed and had little money and few personal possessions. As such, Duncan was classified as an indigent individual under California state law, the transportation of which into the state was strictly prohibited under Section 2615 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of California: \\"Every person, firm or corporation, or officer or agent thereof that brings or assists in bringing into the State any indigent person who is not a resident of the State, knowing him to be an indigent person, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\\" A complaint was subsequently filed against Edwards in Justice Court, where he was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment in the county jail. Edwards appealed to the Superior Court of Yuba County and later to the Supreme Court of the United States, on the argument that his sentence was unconstitutional on the basis that the California law violated the Commerce Clause. Holding The Court found that Section 2615 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of California violated Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution. Concurrences It is worth noting that in writing their concurring opinions, the additional justices chose to forgo the explanation that California had violated Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, arguing that defining the transportation of human beings as “commerce” raises a number of troubling moral questions which undermine individual rights and devalue the original intent of the Commerce Clause. Instead, they propose the idea that the impairment of one's ability to freely traverse interstate borders is a violation of the implied rights of US citizenship, and thereby violates the 14th Amendment and the individual's right to equal protection.

Blacon also has a working relationship with similar suburb 'Lache', although the Lache is not owned by the Sanctuary group, like Blacon, and is substantially smaller. Geography Chester Cathedral viewed from Blacon. Blacon is situated adjacent to the Welsh border and is located on a hill, one mile to the north-west of, and overlooking Chester. The village is built on what was previously farming land and is surrounded by open countryside. Blacon has views across to the city centre of Chester and to the Welsh hills some twenty miles to the west. Other nearby places include Upton by Chester to the north, Saughall and Mollington to the north-west, Newtown to the north-east and the border town of Saltney to the south. Also Blacon has a close proximity to the Wirral. It is roughly 12 miles away from the village Overpool.Map of Blacon History =North Blacon (Blacon Hall)= The Parade Shops in Blacon Blacon was originally known as Blakon Hill and was owned by the Marquess of Crewe.Page 4 The 'Blacon Voice' December 2006 Issue #42 The Parish of Blacon cum Crabwall was formed in 1923, and on 1 April 1936, under the Cheshire County Review Order, 1936, most of the parish was transferred to Chester County Borough.\\"Blacon cum Crabwall Parish Council\\" , 1894-1936 It was a small farming village community until major building work by Chester City Council began in the early 1950s. Most of the older and original estate, was built in the ten years to 1960; though further parts were added on the old army camp site in South Blacon, in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. 'The Parade' Shops, built in 1954 in north Blacon, are an example of Chester City Council building. In 2015, the Parade Enterprise Centre opened, a joint venture between Avenue Services and Cheshire West and Chester Council. The Parade Enterprise Centre houses Sanctuary Housing, Blacon Library, as well as a community hall and various other offices for local businesses. =Blacon Camp (Blacon Lodge)= The British Army maintained an army camp in south Blacon, from just before, to just after, the Second World War. A mixture of wooden and 'Nissen' huts were occupied by soldiers until the late 1950s; and the army firing range was still in evidence until the Chester City Council 'tower block' buildings of the mid-1960s. Blacon Camp housed various military operations, containing aircraft and war prisoners at the time. This part of (South) Blacon is referred to as 'The Camp' by local residents.

Blacon Cemetery Blacon Cemetery was laid out in 1940, during the Second World War, when two plots, in Sections A and H, were set aside for service burials. CWGC Cemetery Report. The cemetery's first interment took place on 20 December 1941. Chester West & Chester Council website - deceased online page. The cemetery contains in all the war graves of 461 Commonwealth service personnel, including an unidentified Royal Air Force airman, and 97 war graves of other nationalities (86 of them Polish servicemen from various hospitals in the area) that are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The plot in Section A was a Royal Air Force regional cemetery for air personnel from bases in Cheshire and neighbouring counties, while members of other armed services were buried in Section H. In 1965 Chester Crematorium, built with garden of remembrance adjoining Section A, was opened. The original chapel was replaced with a new larger chapel that was built alongside it and opened in April 2013. The site of the older building, after its demolition, has been utilised as a memorial garden.Chester Chronicle report, opening of new crematorium, 4 April 2013. Blacon railway station Blacon railway station in December 2006 showing cycle path/walkway and bridge in distance Blacon station was served from Chester Northgate Station, Newtown, but was closed to passengers on 9 September 1968 as part of the 'Beeching Axe' for the economic modernisation of the British railway network in the mid-1960s.Richard Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" was published in 1965. Freight trains ran through Blacon until 20 April 1984, resuming as a single track line on 31 August 1986 before closing again in the early 1990s. Although the old station and railway line have gone, they have been replaced with a tarmac road surface, which now provides a cycle path, jogging track and a countryside walkway. This amenity is accessed from the side of old Blacon station bridge; but its route can also be joined (just off) Chester's 'Fountain' roundabout, travelling via Blacon, and on to the North Wales countryside. Other joined routes can be accessed along the way. In 2008, a volunteer group headed by Stephen Perry in association with the Blacon Community Trust began to raise support for a major improvement of the Blacon Railway Station site. Improvements to date have included woodland sculptures, clearing and new planting of shrubs and trees and the planting of narcissi with much volunteer involvement from local schools and residents. The site (in November 2009) was undergoing phase 2 of a major development to introduce pathways, fencing and special hard-landscaping features. The community trust placed a large train wheel mosaic consisting of pieces from schools and services local to the Blacon area. As of July 2015, the Blacon Railway has been refurbished and fully maintained. There now exists new stairs and ramps for easy access, sings containing the history of the station (exact contents will be given at a later date), and various landscaping improvements to increase appearance and appeal. There also exists a large concrete circle at the center of the station, which contains various carvings into concrete slabs and pieces arranged into sections. These segments were carved by various school children and teenagers from the local schools and projects, and contain each student's particular activity, object or person that they at the time cherished the most. Politics =Local government changes, April 2009= Blacon consisted of two Chester City Council wards, each of which elected three councillors.

He is a household name in France, and nicknamed PPDA. With over 30 years and in excess of 4,500 editions of television news to his credit, he was one of the longest serving newsreaders in the world until he was fired in 2008. He presented his last newscast on TF1 on 10 July 2008.AFP: Star news anchor bows out in French TV shake-up Biography Patrick Poivre was born in Reims, France. He obtained his Baccalauréat at 15, the year he became a father. He then studied Law and Oriental Languages at the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales. Poivre claims to be descended directly from Jacques Poivre, brother of Pierre Poivre, an 18th-century nobleman in the time of Louis XV, \\"d'Arvor\\" being Jacques Poivre's pseudonym. Poivre, his siblings and his three surviving children legally changed their surname to Poivre d'Arvor in 1994. =Journalistic career= Poivre started training as a journalist at the Centre de formation des journalistes (CFJ) at 22. He obtained his first job in 1971 on France Inter as morning newsreader. In 1974, at the time of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's accession to the Presidency, Poivre joined Antenne 2. He made his first TV appearance there in 1975, and was presenter for news bulletins from 16 February 1976 to 28 July 1983. After a brief stint with Canal+, he joined TF1 in 1986 for the Sunday program A la folie pas du tout and Ex Libris, from Frederic Lepage. On 31 August 1987, he became presenter for the weekday news of TF1 at 8 pm from Monday to Thursday. He is satirised in the French puppet show Les Guignols de l'info on Canal+, where his alter ego is the puppet PPD, the news presenter. In 2004, Poivre was cast in a minor voice-only role as a newscaster in the French version of the Pixar animated film The Incredibles (Les Indestructibles). On 9 June 2008, it was reported that Poivre d'Arvor was replaced as presenter of the 8 pm news by Laurence Ferrari. He made his last broadcast on 10 July. In an interview, he said that there was \\"no objective\\" reason for his dismissal, but declined to comment on \\"rumours\\" of political interference.AFP: Star news anchor bows out in French TV shake-up Since January 2009, Patrick Poivre d'Arvor presents La traversée du miroir on France 5. He also presented L'avis des autres on Arte. In July 2009, he was approached by the I-Télé channel to presentThe18h-20h. But he declined the invitation. In June 2010, he led a team in the French TV show Fort Boyard. =Professional controversies= His greatest controversy is the faked interview* Olivier Cyran, Mehdi Ba (et al.), Almanach critique des médias (2005) - éditions Les Arènes. « PPDA/Castro - Fausse interview, vraie mensonge ». \\\\- actually footage of a press conference with added questions - he purported to have made with Cuban president Fidel Castro, broadcast on 16 December 1991. Télérama journalist Pierre Carles exposed this fraud, which Poivre blamed on his colleague and co-interviewer Régis Faucon, after the latter had departed TF1.Les fabuleuses histoires de Poivre d’Arvor on Acrimed On 10 January 1996, the Court of Appeal sentenced Poivre to 15 months in prison (suspended) and fined him 200,000 Francs for his part in misappropriation of public funds in a case involving Pierre Botton and his father-in-law and then deputy mayor of Lyon, Michel Noir.Noir-Botton-Mouillot- PPDA : à Lyon plus dure est la cour d’appel on L'Humanité On 11 September 2001, at 10:15 EDT, while he was interviewing a reporter from New York, a sequence from Star Wars episode IV briefly replaced the live satellite feed from New York showing the World Trade Center. The sequence occurs at the 91st minute of the film, which would place the logical beginning of the film at 08:44, two minutes before the impact on the first tower. The picture quickly switched to PPDA who appeared confused. The glitch was covered on the premium pay television channel Canal+'s Zapping program, and later columnist Alain Rémond wrote about this incident in the weekly Télérama on 13 October 2001, jokingly asking if al-Qaeda operatives had infiltrated TF1. In December 2008, Nonce Paolini, former Chief Executive of TF1, filed for defamation against Poivre d'Arvor in the Correctional Tribunal of Paris: during an interview by Bretons in the preceding July, Poivre had accused the TF1 chief of having \\"installed a clocking-in system with access badges\\" and had formed \\"a private police force whose aim was scrutinising staff movements in the smallest detail\\". Guy Dutheil, « Plaintes en série de TF1 contre l'ancien présentateur Patrick Poivre d'Arvor », Le Monde, 9 December 2008 In January 2011, he became the focus of a plagiarism scandal, accused of stealing the work of a U.S. author in a book on the life of Ernest Hemingway. =Personal life= He was married to Véronique, with whom he has three daughters and one son. They are divorced. Their son Arnaud spoke about the divorce of his parents in the Magazine Gala, in 2010. One daughter, Solenn, committed suicide at a Paris metro station in 1995, aged 19, having been a long-term anorexic. Her plight became a symbol of the problems of anorexia and bulimia, with Poivre becoming a campaigner and writer on the issue. In December 2004, Bernadette Chirac, wife of former President Jacques Chirac, whose daughter also suffered from the disorder, opened a treatment centre in Paris for adolescents and named it \\"Maison de Solenn\\". Poivre caused controversy by presenting his regular news bulletin the evening after Solenn's death. For several years in the 1990s, rumours abounded that Poivre had had an affair with Claire Chazal, his weekend counterpart as TF1 8 pm news presenter. The pair refused to confirm the story until August 2005, when Poivre acknowledged in \\"Confessions\\", a book of interviews to journalist Serge Raffy, that he was the father of Chazal's 10-year-old son, François. \\"We had set at [François' age] ten the time that this story would be revealed\\", Poivre said. Published works He has published many books, two of which are dedicated to his daughter Solenn. He has also written prefaces to books by other authors, and these are not listed here. *Les enfants de l'aube, 1982 J.-C.

Apart from eleven years as a master at Eton College between 1914 and 1925 his career was entirely at Trinity College, Cambridge. At Trinity, Gow was a colleague and friend of A. E. Housman, on whose works he became an authority. The two men shared a sharp-tongued scholarly intolerance of anything they saw as slipshod, pretentious or badly thought-through, but Gow nonetheless won the affection of many of his students. He was Housman's literary executor, and published a book about his friend shortly after Housman's death. Gow's principal subject as a scholar was the Greek bucolic poet Theocritus, his works on whom remain a core source for modern students of the poet. Life and career =Early life= Gow was born in Gower Street, London, the eldest of the three children, all of whom were boys, of Dr (later the Rev) James Gow (1854–1923) and his wife Gertrude Sydenham, née Everett-Green.Lloyd-Jones, Hugh, \\"Gow, Andrew Sydenham Farrar (1886–1978)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 26 June 2016 James Gow, formerly a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, was headmaster of Nottingham High School from 1885 to 1901, and of Westminster School from 1901 to 1919.\\"Death of Dr. Gow\\", The Times, 17 February 1923, p. 13 Gow was christened Andrew after an uncle who was Keeper of the Royal Academy, and, according to a biographical sketch in The Times, it may well have been from the uncle and his circle of friends, which included Poynter and Alma-Tadema, that Gow derived his interest in paintings.\\"Mr. Andrew Gow\\", The Times, 4 February 1978, p. 16 Gow was educated at Nottingham High School and then at Rugby School, after which, in 1905, he won a classical scholarship to Trinity, Cambridge. In the following five years he twice won the Porson Prize for Greek verse composition, the Browne medal for Latin and Greek poetry, and the Charles Oldham Classical Scholarship. Together with Rupert Brooke and others he helped to found the Marlowe Society. He took a first class in both parts of the tripos, gaining a distinction in classical archaeology. =Early career= Eton College, where Gow taught between 1914 and 1925 Gow was elected a Fellow of Trinity in 1911, and took a number of pupils. He applied on four occasions for permanent posts in Cambridge, but was unsuccessful each time. His biographer Hugh Lloyd-Jones suggests that Gow's personality and appearance were a hindrance: In 1914 Gow became a master at Eton College, where he remained for eleven years. He did not serve in the armed forces during the First World War, because a heart murmur disqualified him for service; he volunteered to help train young soldiers in the use of the Lewis gun. Lloyd-Jones comments that some of Gow's Eton pupils were daunted by his dryness and his caustic wit, others recognised his fine scholarship and the considerable help he gave them; he became known, not unaffectionately, as \\"Granny Gow\\" by pupils and colleagues.Lyttelton/Hart- Davis, Volume 4, pp. 82 and 84 His Eton pupils included Alan Clutton-Brock, David Lindsay, Anthony Powell, and George Orwell. =Trinity don= Trinity College, Cambridge, where Gow lectured from 1925 By 1925 Gow was settled at Eton and looking forward to becoming a housemaster, when he was invited to resume his fellowship at Trinity as a preliminary to being appointed Tutor. He hesitated because his perfectionism led him to question whether he could meet the academic standards he felt necessary for such a post. Two academics who knew him well, D. S. Robertson and A. E. Housman convinced him that his doubts were unwarranted, and he accepted. Trinity remained his home for the rest of his life. He was a University Lecturer, 1925–51; Tutor, 1929–42; Praelector, 1946–51; and Brereton Reader in Classics, 1947–51.\\"Gow, Andrew Sydenham Farrar\\", Who Was Who, Oxford University Press, 2014. Retrieved 26 June 2016 Gow served successively on the Council of the Senate, the General Board of the Faculties, and, as chairman, the Board of Fine Arts. More congenial to him, according to The Times, was his long membership of the Fitzwilliam Museum board. Lloyd-Jones writes that Gow did much to interest undergraduates in art, \\"a subject by no means popular among the Cambridge dons of his generation.\\" Though not a man of means, Gow became a respected collector and connoisseur of art. Among the undergraduates who were grateful for his enthusiasm and guidance was Anthony Blunt; he wrote of Gow: A. E. Housman, poet and formidable classics scholar, Gow's colleague and friend Gow, like his friend and Trinity colleague Housman, was known for his high standards, impatience with anything second-rate, and a sharp tongue. His Eton colleague and lifelong friend George Lyttelton commented, \\"That Housman blend of an impossibly lofty and unsympathetic standard with needlessly abusive words is really very regrettable and unhelpful\\".Lyttelton/Hart Davis, Volume 1, p. 101 The Times observed that another side to Gow's character was shown in the letters he wrote month by month to pupils serving in the forces during the Second World War: \\"In them he is as his friends knew him – wise, warm-hearted, and possessed of a rich sense of humour. For Housman, \\"No one could have a better friend than I have found in Gow,\\" although even Gow sometimes found the older man daunting: when asked by colleagues to put a knotty question of translation to Housman, he refused, on the grounds that Housman would merely say that the meaning was obvious to the feeblest intellect.Lyttelton/Hart-Davis, Volume 4, p. 558 Shortly after Housman's death in 1936 he published a short study of his friend; although it concentrated on Housman's scholarship, in Lloyd-Jones's view it \\"throws more light upon him than almost any of the studies by literary persons\\". Gow acted as Housman's literary executor, collaborating uneasily with Laurence Housman, the poet's brother, whom he found difficult;Lyttelton/Hart-Davis, Volume 4, p. 28 Gow supervised a second edition of Housman's edition of Manilius in 1937. From 1947 to 1953 Gow served as a trustee of the National Gallery. He built up a private collection of the works of Degas, which he left to the Fitzwilliam Museum. Gow's scholarly publications include editions of his main study, Theocritus, and works by Nicander, Machon, Moschus, and Bion. He prepared the second edition of Housman's edition of Manilius, and the second volume of Sir William Ridgeway's The Early Age of Greece. In Lloyd-Jones's view Gow's work on Theocritus and Hellenistic epigrams will remain \\"an essential instrument of scholarship\\". In 1951 Gow retired from his lecturing posts, continuing to live in rooms at Trinity until 1973 when he moved to a nursing home in Cambridge, where he died in 1978 at the age of ninety-one.

He served as a Cabinet Minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin and Walter Weir and as the province's 20th Lieutenant Governor from 1986 to 1993. Early life Johnson was born in Winnipeg, to a family of Icelandic heritage. He received a B.Sc. and M.D. from the University of Manitoba and served as a Lieutenant (later, Captain) with the Royal Canadian Navy from 1941-1945. Political career Johnson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1958, for the riding of Gimli, north of Winnipeg. A Progressive Conservative, he was appointed Minister of Health and Public Welfare in the minority government of Dufferin Roblin, who had personally recruited him to run for the party. He retained the health portfolio when the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in 1959, and oversaw a policy of major hospital expansions in the province and other significant reforms between 1959 and 1963. On December 9, 1963, Johnson moved to the Ministry of Education as the government sought to cope with the educational requirements of a rapidly expanding baby-boom population. He held this position until September 24, 1968, and was responsible for, among other achievements, the establishment of the universities of Winnipeg and Brandon, respectively, and the Manitoba Institute of Technology (later 'Red River Community College'), and for introducing the policy of \\"shared services\\" for public and separate schools (allowing children in separate schools to access public programs for busing, textbooks and the like). In 1968, Johnson returned to his old portfolio as Minister of Health, to oversee an historic change in the provision of medical services: the implementation of medicare in Manitoba. Ideologically, Johnson was a progressive, often referred to as (somewhat erroneously) a Red Tory with beliefs similar to those held by Premier Roblin. Along with Roblin, he is considered by historians to be the leading political reformer of his generation and among the most influential cabinet ministers in Manitoba history. Although generally a free marketeer, Johnson supported government intervention in the economy in certain areas, for example, in such areas as public utility management, education, major infrastructure projects and certain medical services. When Roblin shifted to federal politics in 1967, Johnson was the only candidate from the Progressive Conservative Party's progressive wing to seek its leadership. A late entry into the leadership race hurt his campaign and while he was the alternative choice for leader among many delegates, the fact that Johnson did not survive to the later balloting prevented him from emerging as the possible compromise choice for party leader among delegates. =Break from politics= Johnson did not seek re-election in 1969, and returned to medical practice in Winnipeg. An experienced physician, within a few years he had one of the largest medical practices in Manitoba. =Lieutenant governorship= Leaving medicine again for the public arena in 1978, Johnson served for the subsequent eight years as a special consultant to the Manitoba government, providing strategic advice and counsel to the government in various areas of health policy. On December 11, 1986, in \\"recognition of his services to the people of Manitoba\\", he was appointed as the province's lieutenant governor by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He served in this position until March 5, 1993. Honours In his career, the governments of Canada and Iceland conferred on Johnson the highest civilian honours that can be bestowed on their respective citizens: the Order of Canada in 1994, and the Icelandic Order of the Falcon in 1992. He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from three universities: Manitoba, Winnipeg and Royal Roads (1992–95). George Johnson Middle School in Gimli was named in his honour. Death Johnson died in 1995 in Gimli. His wife, the former Doris Blondal, died the following year. They had six children and ten grandchildren. Their daughter Janis was a Manitoba senator for twenty six years.

Every day, the organization prepares 2,500 meals and provides 200 bags of groceries to help sustain clients as they battle serious illnesses, isolation, or the health challenges of old age. Project Open Hand serves San Francisco and Alameda Counties, engaging more than 125 volunteers every day to nourish the community.  History  Project Open Hand was created in 1985 by Ruth Brinker, a woman who recognized the relatively small number of social services for those infected with HIV/AIDS. She noticed the effects of malnutrition on the terminally ill from watching a number of her friends struggle to get proper nourishment during their illness. After noticing a growing problem, the idea for delivering hot meals to them was born, and a positive impact was soon to follow. Ruth began by delivering meals to 7 people living with AIDS, and from there, the word quickly spread. In 1990, the Food Bank Program at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation (which, at that time, was distributing bags of staple groceries to 600 low-income people with AIDS per week) was merged into Project Open Hand. The merger created a single organization that was more efficient than having two separate programs, and which delivered hot meals as well as groceries. Project Open Hand receives two thirds of its funding through private donations, with one third coming from governmental agencies. Food service operations, such as the preparation of hot meals, bagging of groceries, and delivery of food to those in need are all conducted by more than 125 daily volunteers in combination with the full and part-time staff of 110 people.

She currently resides in Adelaide in South Australia where the Australian Institute of Sport's Track Cycling program has its headquarters at the Adelaide Super-Drome. She has been the 500 metre track time trial world champion on four occasions, and a gold medallist at the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. At the 2015 UCI Track Cycling World Championships Meares took the gold in the keirin—her 11th world title in total, which made her the most decorated female track cyclist of all time. She was the flag-bearer and captain for the Australian team at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in keirin. This made her the first Australian to win individual medals in four consecutive Olympics. On 16 October 2016 Meares announced her official retirement from her current competitive cycling career. Biography Anna Meares started competitive cycling at the age of 11 in 1994, following her older sister Kerrie Meares into the sport. The family were inspired to take up competitive cycling by Kathy Watt winning a cycling gold medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. With the family living in the small Queensland coal- mining town of Middlemount, it was more than two hours drive to the nearest cycling track at Mackay for the girls to train. Over the course of her career, Meares has talked about how gradually she became aware of her position as a role model, portraying \\"a different stereotypical image of what it is to be a strong woman. It's not always about being skinny. It's about your presentation and your confidence and everyone is unique.\\" In February 2020 she gave birth to a daughter, Evelyn, with her partner Nick Flygger. =2002= In 2002 Meares narrowly missed a bronze medal in the inaugural inclusion of the 500-metre time trial at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, while her older sister, Kerrie Meares won the gold medal in the event. She won a bronze medal in the sprint. =2004= During the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she won a gold medal, and set a new world record in the Women's 500-metre time trial of 33.952 seconds. Meares had to beat a new Olympic record set just minutes previously by the reigning World Record holder, Yonghua Jiang of China. (See Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics). The event was abolished from the Olympic program so Meares could not defend her title in 2008. Meares also won a bronze medal in the Women's 200m Sprint event in Athens. In May 2004 at the Time Trial World Titles in Melbourne Meares claimed the title of Women's World time trial champion, and won a silver for the sprint event. Also claimed first in the 2004 World Cup Time Trial in Sydney. =2005= In 2005, Meares enrolled in a Bachelor of Learning Design course at Central Queensland University, but deferred her studies to concentrate on sport. =2008= Meares made an astonishing come back from a very bad cycling accident at the World Cup in January 2008 when she broke her neck. Meares crashed in the third round of the World Cup circuit in Los Angeles in January 2008, seven months out from the Olympics. Meares fractured her C2 vertebra, dislocated her right shoulder, suffered torn ligaments and tendons, a heavily bruised right hip and skin abrasions as a result of skin sliding on wood when she crashed at 65 km/h. Astonishingly she was back on the bike just 10 days after the fall and went through intensive rehabilitation. With the points Meares had secured prior to the crash, she was able to fight her way back and qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Meares at the 2008 Olympic homecoming parade in Adelaide Meares had an eventful semi-final in the sprint at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Having lost the first heat to her opponent Guo Shuang, she won the second heat. The third heat saw Guo come down the banking too steeply and her front wheel slipped from beneath her. The heat was re-run and although Guo won by a few millimetres, she was relegated for coming down the track and pushing Meares onto the côte d'azure on the final lap. This put Meares through to the final ride-off for gold against Victoria Pendleton, where she was beaten and received the silver medal. =2012= At the 2012 World Championships which took place in Meares' home country of Australia in Melbourne, Meares was favourite for three gold medals. In the team sprint Meares won silver as Germany set two world records in the event. In qualification for the individual sprint Meares broke the world record for the flying start 200 metres. Meares completed her four laps in just 10.782 seconds shaving 11 thousands of a second off Simona Krupeckaite's mark. In the semi final Meares faced her old rival Pendleton. Pendleton clashed with the Australian in their first heat and ended up on the floor before Meares was relegated from the second for going outside of her lane. In the decider Pendleton won in a photo finish, with Meares settling for bronze after defeating Lyubov Shulika. In the keirin, Meares won both her qualifying races before reaching the final, where she held off Russian Ekaterina Gnidenko and German Kristina Vogel to win the first of two world championships in Melbourne. Meares set her second world record of the championships in her final event. Meares recorded 33.010 seconds to break the record by .286 of a second which was previously held by Simona Krupeckaite. With the time Meares won her second title of the championships and equaled Felicia Ballanger's record of ten world titles. In preparation for the Olympics, Meares and her coach, West, tailored a 'Project Know Thy Enemy' program. Slot, O. (2012). Pendleton versus Meares. In E. Bacon & L. Birnie (Eds.), The Cycling Anthology Volume One (pp. 130-147). London: Yellow Jersey Press. The 'Project' involved Meares racing against male sprinter: Alex Bird; who would mimic Pendleton: former \\"friend\\" turned \\"enemy\\". The objective was to run multiple racing scenarios and find the best tactic to beat \\"Queen Vic\\". At the 2012 London Olympics, Meares qualified for the final of the sprint, where she again faced Victoria Pendleton. In the first sprint of the final, Pendleton crossed the line first, but was controversially relegated after illegally moving off her line as the cyclists sped through the final banking, which many believe was as a result of Meares aggressive riding. Meares won the second sprint to win 2–0 and take the gold medal. When asked about her tactics, perceived as being unsporting, she responded: \\"this is sport [...] We're not out there to have a cup of tea\\". She also won a bronze medal with Kaarle McCulloch in the team sprint.Anna Meares. sports-reference.com =2013= Meares took rest after the 2012 Olympics and skipped the 2013 World Championship. She returned to competitions in July 2013. Later that year she set a new world record of 32.836 seconds in the women's 500 m time trial at the UCI Mexico Track World Cup, making her the first woman to go under 33 seconds in the event. =2015–16= In late February 2015, Meares competed at the world championships and won three medals. She also separated from her husband of nine years, Mark Chadwick, early in 2015. At the 2016 Rio Olympics Meares took part in three events. She won a bronze medal in the keirin, placing tenth in the individual sprint and fourth in the team sprint. Honours In 2001 Meares was awarded the Australian Junior Women's Track Cyclist of the Year. She was voted Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Athlete of the Year in 2007 and 2011AIS Athlete of the Year. ausport.gov.au and 2011 inducted into the AIS 'Best of the Best'.Best of the Best. Australian Institute of Sport Between 2004 and 2012 she has been named Australian Elite Female Track Cyclist of the Year seven times, she also became Australian Cyclist of the Year in 2008 and 2012. She served as the Australian flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The Anna Meares Bike Path adjacent to Sir Donald Bradman Drive near Adelaide Airport was named after Meares in 2012. On 9 December 2016, Meares received the Key to the City of Rockhampton. Meares has a velodrome in Brisbane named after her. It is called the Anna Meares Velodrome and it was opened on 12 November 2016. It was an official venue for the track cycling at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

They formed in 1975 and released two 7\\" EPs on an indie label in 1976 and 1977 before signing with Blank Records (a subsidiary label of Mercury Records) in 1977 and releasing one album, Make a Record. Despite their short original 4-year stint together, the Suicide Commandos are considered the pioneers for jump-starting a punk rock music scene in the Twin Cities, which eventually produced bands like The Suburbs, Hüsker Dü, The Replacements and Soul Asylum. History Their first album, Make a Record was recorded and released in 1977, and then re-released on Mercury Records on CD in 1996 and on Island/DefJam iTunes in 2007. A live album, The Suicide Commandos Commit Suicide Dance Concert was released on Twin/Tone Records in 1979, which was their last performance together before the band broke up. Only 1,000 numbered copies were pressed. In 2000 it was re-released on CD by Garage D'Or Records. The original vinyl release contained 19 tracks while the CD re- release increased this figure, bringing the total number of tracks to 32. Their 1977 song \\"Burn It Down\\" inspired a short film directed by rock video pioneer Chuck Statler, which featured the burning of a house the band had used for rehearsing for several years. \\"Burn It Down\\" was part of a Chuck Statler video retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in 2006. =Hiatus= When the Commandos broke up in 1980, Almaas went to New York and formed a band called The Crackers, then issued a solo EP titled \\"Beat Rodeo\\". In 1982, Almaas formed a four-man group called (The) Beat Rodeo, which issued two well- received albums in the mid-80s before disbanding. Almaas then went solo again, issuing six albums over the next two decades. =Re-formation= The Suicide Commanos' song \\"Complicated Fun\\" was used for Target commercials for Xbox and PlayStation products in 2003–2004. The band was a headline act at the Minnesota State Fair in 2007. Ahl and Osgood were street corner acoustic musicians in St. Paul during the 2008 Republican convention. On January 17, 2009 the Commandos played a benefit at Nick & Eddie in Minneapolis for Laura Kennedy, bassist and founding member of the NYC no-wave band the Bush Tetras, who had recently received a liver transplant. David Thomas of Pere Ubu was guest vocalist. November 7, 2009 was declared \\"Suicide Commando Day\\" in the city of Minneapolis, MN by Mayor RT Rybak. On January 29, 2012, the band were a co-headlining act at the 7th Birthday Party for the popular member-supported radio station, \\"The Current\\" (89.3 FM). The event was held at 1st Avenue in downtown Minneapolis and brought thousands of the most dedicated fans of the radio station together to witness an important piece of punk rock history at a legendary Minneapolis venue. The Current released a ten-inch EP called \\"The Current Makes A Record\\" featuring studio performances by The Hold Steady and The Suicide Commandos in a limited, numbered 1,000-copy edition to celebrate their 10th Anniversary in January 2015. (Much like the limited, numbered 1000 copies of Twin/Tone Records \\"The Commandos Commit Suicide Dance Party\\"- recorded performances of the Commandos \\"final shows\\" at The Longhorn Bar, Minneapolis in December 1978.) There was a Record Release Party featuring The Commandos and Craig Finn and Tad Kubler of The Hold Steady at The Turf Club, St. Paul January 16, 2015. On July 29, 2015, a new Hennepin County highway sign revealed that \\"The Suicide Commandos Punk Rock Band\\" had adopted a 1.5 mile stretch of Hennepin County Road 16 or McGinty Road in Minnetonka, MN. In 2016 the Commandos recorded their first studio album in 38 years. Time Bomb was recorded by Kevin Bowe at Master Mix, Minneapolis, MN, mixed by Mitch Easter at Fidelitorium, Kernersville, NC and mastered by Bruce Templeton at Microphonic Mastering, Minneapolis, MN. Additional recording happened in West Saugerties and Chester, NY. Minneapolis' pioneering alternative music label Twin/Tone Records was revived to release \\"Time Bomb\\"- the label's first release since 1994. Each member contributed four songs to the album. The thirteenth song, \\"If I Can't Make You Love Me\\" was co-written by the band. The first single, “Boogie’s Coldest Acre” became available to United States radio April 5, 2017. Twin/Tone Records began taking pre-orders April 15. 1,000 numbered copies of vinyl and downloads of the album release May 5, 2017, with Listening Party and in-store appearances that weekend. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges declared May 5, 2017 \\"Commando Day\\" in the Twin Cities. Vinyl copies of \\"Time Bomb\\" sold out immediately. Suicide Commandos' star on the outside mural of First Avenue The Suicide Commandos have been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.

Geography Port Hudson is located at 30.678056 North and 91.268889 West, and is along the east bank of the Mississippi River. History Port Hudson & Vicinity, 1864. In 1833, one of the first railroads in the United States was built from Port Hudson to Clinton. Clinton was the entrepôt for the produce of much of the region, which, sent by rail, was transferred to steamboats at Port Hudson. Old Port Hudson was incorporated as a town in 1838.Maurice Thompson (1888), The Story of Louisiana, p. 316. During the American Civil War, the area was the scene of bitter fighting as the Confederacy and Union struggled over control of the Mississippi River (see Siege of Port Hudson). Location of the tracks and the old town can be seen at the bend of the Mississippi River (view 1864 map).Map of Port Hudson and vicinity; Prepared by order of Major General N. P.

Landmarks Map of Port Hudson & vicinity, 1906. A portion of the battlefield site is maintained by the state as a park and museum, called the Port Hudson State Historic Site (in adjacent East Feliciana Parish). In 1930 the Louisiana Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected the Confederate Soldiers monument at the site; it is an 11,000-pound obelisk, dedicated to the defenders' memory. In 2007 the monument was moved to the yard of one of Port Hudson's few surviving buildings from the time of the siege.George Morris, \\"UDC monument no longer hidden,\\" The Advocate, 7 December 2007.Confederate Soldiers monument photograph circa 1940s, State Library of Louisiana.

Arthur Seebach, Jr. In the process of working on problems like the metrization problem, topologists (including Steen and Seebach) have defined a wide variety of topological properties. It is often useful in the study and understanding of abstracts such as topological spaces to determine that one property does not follow from another. One of the easiest ways of doing this is to find a counterexample which exhibits one property but not the other. In Counterexamples in Topology, Steen and Seebach, together with five students in an undergraduate research project at St. Olaf College, Minnesota in the summer of 1967, canvassed the field of topology for such counterexamples and compiled them in an attempt to simplify the literature. For instance, an example of a first-countable space which is not second-countable is counterexample #3, the discrete topology on an uncountable set. This particular counterexample shows that second-countability does not follow from first-countability. Several other \\"Counterexamples in ...\\" books and papers have followed, with similar motivations. Reviews In her review of the first edition, Mary Ellen Rudin wrote: :In other mathematical fields one restricts one's problem by requiring that the space be Hausdorff or paracompact or metric, and usually one doesn't really care which, so long as the restriction is strong enough to avoid this dense forest of counterexamples. A usable map of the forest is a fine thing... In his submissionC. Wayne Patty (1971) \\"Review: Counterexamples in Topology\\", to Mathematical Reviews C. Wayne Patty wrote: :...the book is extremely useful, and the general topology student will no doubt find it very valuable. In addition it is very well written. When the second edition appeared in 1978 its review in Advances in Mathematics treated topology as territory to be explored: :Lebesgue once said that every mathematician should be something of a naturalist. This book, the updated journal of a continuing expedition to the never-never land of general topology, should appeal to the latent naturalist in every mathematician. Notation Several of the naming conventions in this book differ from more accepted modern conventions, particularly with respect to the separation axioms. The authors use the terms T3, T4, and T5 to refer to regular, normal, and completely normal. They also refer to completely Hausdorff as Urysohn.

He is best known as the captain of the Susan Constant, the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607 on the way to found the settlement at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was also in overall command of the other two ships on that initial voyage, in order of their size, the Godspeed and the Discovery. He made several voyages of supply between England and Jamestown; in 1609, he became Captain of the Virginia Company's new supply ship, Sea Venture, which met a hurricane during the Third Supply mission, and was shipwrecked on the archipelago of Bermuda. Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, was named in his honour. Early life Christopher Newport was born in Limehouse, an important trading port on the River Thames in December 1561. His father, also named Christopher Newport, was a shipmaster who worked in the commercial shipping trade on the east coast of England. The maiden name of his mother Jane is unknown. Newport was christened at Harwich on 29 December. Newport went to sea in 1580, and he quickly rose to the rank of a master mariner and dealt with trade going into London. On 19 October 1584 he married Katherine Proctor in Harwich.Christopher Newport Accessed 2017-01-09 =Privateer= Model of the Portuguese Carrack Madre de Deus. Newport helped in the capture of this large rich vessel off the Azores in 1592 From 1585 following the outbreak of the Anglo–Spanish War, Newport worked as a privateer who raided Spanish freighters off and on in the Caribbean. Over the years he commanded a series of privateer ships, including the Little John, the Margaret, and the Golden Dragon. In 1590, Newport participated in an expedition to the Caribbean, which was financed and organised by famed London merchant John Watts. On this voyage, Newport lost an arm during a fight to capture a Spanish galleon. Despite his injury, Newport continued to conduct privateer raids for almost twenty years, working with Watts. His accomplishments during this period included a successful expedition off Cuba in 1591, and the capture of the Portuguese ship Madre de Deus off the Azores in 1592. The Madre de Deus yielded the greatest English plunder of the century, including five hundred tons of spices, silks, gemstones, and other treasures. In 1603 he conducted his last mission of the war, raiding Puerto Caballos. The spoils from all these missions were shared with London merchants who funded them.Fiske, John (1900). Old Virginia and Her Neighbours, p. 58. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. Newport made an attempt to invade Spanish Jamaica in 1603, but was repelled by Governor Fernando Melgarejo.C.V. Black, A History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), pp. 43-4. After another mission to the Caribbean, he returned to England in 1605 with two baby crocodiles and a wild boar. These he presented as gifts to King James I, who had a fascination with exotic animals. Jamestown  It was Newport's experience as well as his reputation which led to his hiring in 1606 by the Virginia Company of London. The company had been granted a proprietorship to establish a settlement in the Virginia Colony by King James I. Newport took charge of the ship Susan Constant, and on the 1606–1607 voyage, she carried 71 colonists, all male, one of whom was John Smith. As soon as land was in sight, sealed orders from the Virginia Company were opened which named Newport as a member of the governing Council of the Colony. On 29 April, Newport erected a cross at the mouth of the bay, at a place they named Cape Henry, to claim the land for the Crown. In the following days, the ships ventured inland upstream along the James River seeking a suitable location for their settlement as defined in their orders. Newport (accompanied by Smith) then explored the Powhatan Flu (River) up to Richmond (the Powhatan Flu would soon be called the James River), then a few weeks after arriving at Jamestown he was allowed to assume his seat on the council.Fiske (1900), p. 98. =First and Second Supply missions= In June 1607, a week after the initial Fort at Jamestown was completed, Newport sailed back for London on the Susan Constant with a load of pyrite (\\"fools' gold\\") and other supposedly precious minerals, leaving behind 104 colonists, and the tiny Discovery for the use of the colonists. The Susan Constant, which had been a rental ship that had customarily been used as a freight transport, did not return to Virginia again. However, Newport did return twice from England with additional supplies in the following 18 months, leading what were termed the First and Second Supply missions. Despite original intentions to grow food and trade with the Native Americans, the barely surviving colonists became dependent upon the supply missions. Before the arrival of the First Supply, over half of the colonists perished in the winter of 1607–08. The Coronation of Powhatan, oil on canvas, John Gadsby Chapman, 1835 The urgently needed First Supply mission arrived in Jamestown on 8 January 1608. The two ships under Newport's command were the John and Francis and the Phoenix. However, despite replenishing the supplies, the two ships also brought an additional 120 men, so with the survivors of the initial group, there were now 158 colonists, as recorded later by John Smith. Accordingly, Newport left again for England almost immediately to obtain more supplies for the colonists. On this trip Newport took Powhatan's tribesman Namontack to London, arriving on 10 April 1608. Namontack remained in London for three months and then returned to Virginia with Newport. The Second Supply arrived in September 1608, this time with Newport commanding the Mary Margaret, a ship of about 150 tons. In addition to urgently needed supplies, the Second Supply delivered another 70 persons as well as the first two women from England, a \\"gentlewoman\\" and a woman servant. Realizing that Powhatan's friendship was crucial to the survival of the small Jamestown colony, Newport was also ordered to \\"crown\\" the chief with a ceremonial crown to make him an English \\"vassal.\\"Rountree, Helen C. and E. Randolph Turner III. Before and After Jamestown: Virginia's Powhatans and Their Predecessors. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2002. The coronation went badly however, because he stated he was already a king and refused to kneel to receive the crown. The need for another, ideally much larger, supply mission was conveyed to the leaders of the Virginia Company effectively when Newport returned to England. Additional funds and resources were gathered and readied. However, the Third Supply, as well as the company's new purpose-built flagship, the Sea Venture, were each to become big problems for Jamestown. =Third Supply: ill-fated Sea Venture= Sylvester Jordain's \\"A Discovery of the Barmudas\\". Newport made a third trip to America in June 1609, as captain of the Sea Venture and \\"Vice Admiral\\" of the Third Supply mission. However, on 24 July, the nine ships encountered a massive three-day-long storm, and became separated. The flagship of the mission, the Sea Venture, being newly built for the voyage, was leaking heavily, having lost her caulking. Sir George Somers, who had taken the helm, deliberately drove her upon a reef in Bermuda to prevent her foundering. Eventually, in May 1610, the survivors (150 colonists and crew members, and one dog) constructed two smaller ships, the Deliverance and the Patience, from the wreck and the abundant native Bermuda cedar. Arriving at Jamestown 10 months later than planned, where the death of over 80% of the colonists had occurred during the Starving Time, Newport and the others had precious few supplies to share. Both groups felt they had no alternative but to return to England. On 7 June, they boarded the ships, and started to sail downstream and abandon Jamestown. However, as they approached Mulberry Island, they were met by a 'fourth\\" supply mission sailing upstream headed by a new governor, Thomas West, who ordered the remaining settlers to return.  Later voyages, death  On 12 May 1611 Newport arrived once again back at Jamestown, accompanied by Sir Thomas Dale, departing 20 August, for what would be his last time.Christopher Newport (1561–after 15 August 1617) Accessed 2017-01-11 In 1612, he joined the Royal Navy, accepting a commission first offered to him in 1606, and entered the English East India Company. In 1613, aboard the Expedition, Newport commanded the twelfth voyage of the Company to the Far East. In 1615 he sailed to India. In November 1616 he wrote his will, and set out on his third voyage to the East Indies (this time accompanied by his son, also called Christopher, who joined the crew). By May 1617, he was in South Africa, but he died in Java (now part of Indonesia) sometime after 15 August 1617 of unknown causes.

They are the sole surviving subgroup of the Mura people, and are hunter-gatherers. They live mainly on the banks of the Maici River in Humaitá and Manicoré in the state of Amazonas. , they number 800 individuals. The Pirahã people do not call themselves Pirahã but instead the Hi'aiti'ihi, roughly translated as \\"the straight ones.\\" To the linguistic anthropologist Daniel Everett, > The Pirahã are supremely gifted in all the ways necessary to ensure their > continued survival in the jungle: they know the usefulness and location of > all important plants in their area; they understand the behavior of local > animals and how to catch and avoid them; and they can walk into the jungle > naked, with no tools or weapons, and walk out three days later with baskets > of fruit, nuts, and small game. The Pirahã speak the Pirahã language. They call any other language \\"crooked head\\". Members of the Pirahã can whistle their language, which is how Pirahã men communicate when hunting in the jungle.  Culture  As far as the Pirahã have related to researchers, their culture is concerned solely with matters that fall within direct personal experience, and thus there is no history beyond living memory. Pirahã have a simple kinship system that includes baíxi (parent, grandparent, or elder), xahaigí (sibling, male or female), hoagí or hoísai (son), kai (daughter), and piihí (stepchild, favorite child, child with at least one deceased parent, and more). Daniel Everett states that one of the strongest Pirahã values is no coercion; you simply don't tell other people what to do. There appears to be no social hierarchy; the Pirahã have no formal leaders. Their social system is similar to that of many other hunter-gatherer bands in the world, although rare in the Amazon because of a history of horticulture before Western contact (see history of the Amazon). Although the Pirahã use canoes every day for fishing and for crossing the river that they live beside, when their canoes wear out, they simply use pieces of bark as temporary canoes. Everett brought in a master builder who taught and supervised the Pirahã in making a canoe, so that they could make their own. But when they needed another canoe, they said that \\"Pirahã do not make canoes\\" and told Everett he should buy them a canoe. The Pirahã rely on neighboring communities' canoe work, and use those canoes for themselves. Pirahã build simple huts where they keep a few pots, pans, knives, and machetes. They make only scraping implements (for making arrowheads), loosely woven palm-leaf bags, bows, and arrows. They take naps of 15 minutes to, at the most, two hours throughout the day and night, and rarely sleep through the night. They do not store food in any quantity, but generally eat it when they get it. Pirahã have ignored lessons in preserving meats by salting or smoking. They cultivate manioc plants that grow from spit-out seeds and make only a few days' worth of manioc flour at a time. They trade Brazil nuts and sex for consumables or tools, e.g. machetes, gunpowder, powdered milk, sugar, whiskey. Chastity is not a cultural value. They trade Brazil nuts, wood, and sorva (rubbery sap used in chewing gum) for soda-can pull-tabs, which are used for necklaces. Men wear T-shirts and shorts that they get from traders; women sew their own plain cotton dresses. Their decoration is mostly necklaces, used primarily to ward off spirits. The concept of drawing is alien to them and when asked to draw a person, animal, tree, or river, the result is simple lines.Gordon, Peter. Numerical Cognition Without Words: Evidence from Amazonia, Supporting Online Materials, p. 5. Science, 2004. However, on seeing a novelty such as an airplane, a child may make a model of it, which may be soon discarded.John Colapinto (2007), The Interpreter. New Yorker, 2007-04-16 According to Everett, the Pirahã have no concept of a supreme spirit or god,Everett, Daniel. \\"Endangered Languages and Lost Knowledge\\" , The Long Now Foundation, San Francisco, March 20, 2009. For the relevant info, see transcript of the talk or play chapter 8 of the video at 33:40. and they lost interest in Jesus when they discovered that Everett had never seen him. They require evidence based on personal experience for every claim made. However, they do believe in spirits that can sometimes take on the shape of things in the environment. These spirits can be jaguars, trees, or other visible, tangible things including people. Everett reported one incident where the Pirahã said that “Xigagaí, one of the beings that lives above the clouds, was standing on a beach yelling at us, telling us that he would kill us if we go into the jungle.” Everett and his daughter could see nothing and yet the Pirahã insisted that Xigagaí was still on the beach. =Adoption of modern culture= A 2012 documentary called The Grammar of Happiness which aired on the Smithsonian Channel, reported that a school had been opened for the Pirahã community where they learn Portuguese and mathematics. According to FUNAI the school is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education of Brazil. In addition to a formal school being introduced to the culture, the documentary also reported that the Brazilian government installed a modern medical clinic, electricity and television in the remote area.  Language  Anthropological linguist Daniel Everett, who wrote the first Pirahã grammar, claims that there are related pairs of curiosities in their language and culture. After working with the language for thirty years, Everett states that it has no relative clauses or grammatical recursion. Everett points out that there is recursion of ideas: that in a story, there may be subordinate ideas inside other ideas. He also pointed out that different experts have different definitions of recursion. If the language lacks grammatical recursion, then it is proposed as a counterexample to the theory proposed by Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002) that recursion is a feature which all human languages must have. Pirahã is perhaps second only to Rotokas in New Guinea for the distinction of having the fewest phonemes of any of the world's languages. Women sometimes pronounce s as h, reducing the inventory still further. Everett states that Pirahã, Rotokas, and Hawaiian each have eleven phonemes. Their language is a unique living language (it is related to Mura, which is no longer spoken). John Colapinto explains, \\"Unrelated to any other extant tongue, and based on just eight consonants and three vowels, Pirahã has one of the simplest sound systems known. Yet it possesses such a complex array of tones, stresses, and syllable lengths that its speakers can dispense with their vowels and consonants altogether and sing, hum, or whistle conversations.\\" Peter Gordon writes that the language has a very complex verb structure: \\"To the verb stem are appended up to 15 potential slots for morphological markers that encode aspectual notions such as whether events were witnessed, whether the speaker is certain of its occurrence, whether it is desired, whether it was proximal or distal, and so on. None of the markers encode features such as person, number, tense or gender.\\" Curiously, although not unprecedentedly, the language has no cardinal or ordinal numbers. Some researchers, such as Peter Gordon of Columbia University, claim that the Pirahã are incapable of learning numeracy. His colleague, Daniel L. Everett, on the other hand, argues that the Pirahã are cognitively capable of counting; they simply choose not to do so. They believe that their culture is complete and does not need anything from outside cultures. Everett says, \\"The crucial thing is that the Pirahã have not borrowed any numbers—and they want to learn to count. They asked me to give them classes in Brazilian numbers, so for eight months I spent an hour every night trying to teach them how to count. And it never got anywhere, except for a few of the children. Some of the children learned to do reasonably well, but as soon as anybody started to perform well, they were sent away from the classes. It was just a fun time to eat popcorn and watch me write things on the board.\\" The language does not have words for precise numbers, but rather concepts for a small amount and a larger amount. The language may have no unique words for colors, contradicting Berlin and Kay's hypothesis on the universality of color-naming. There are no unanalyzable root words for color; the recorded color words are all compounds like mii sai or bii sai, \\"blood- like,\\" indicating that colors in the language are adjectival comparisons that are not consistently applied. It is suspected that the language's entire pronoun set, which is the simplest of any known language, was recently borrowed from one of the Tupí–Guaraní languages, and that before that the language may have had no pronouns whatsoever. Many linguists, however, find this claim questionable due to lack of evidence. However, if there had been pronouns at an earlier stage of Pirahã, this would not affect Everett's claim of the significance of the system's simplicity today. There are few Tupi–Guaraní loanwords in areas of the lexicon more susceptible to borrowing (such as nouns referring to cultural items, for instance).

The curve of intersection of the plane and the surface will have zero curvature at that point. Asymptotic directions can only occur when the Gaussian curvature is negative (or zero). There will be two asymptotic directions through every point with negative Gaussian curvature, bisected by the principal directions.

Remembered for his missionary work, scholarship, and leadership in Alaska and the Russian Far East during the 19th century, he is known for his abilities as a scholar, linguist, and administrator, as well as his great zeal for his work. As a missionary priest he took his wife and family with him. In these territories he learned several languages and dialects of the indigenous peoples. He wrote many of the earliest scholarly works about the native peoples of Alaska, including dictionaries and grammars for their languages for which he devised writing systems; also, he wrote religious works in, and translated parts of the Bible into, several of these languages. His books were published beginning in 1840. Early life and education Saint Innocent was born Ivan Evseyevich Popov (Иван Евсеевич Попов) on August 26, 1797 into the family of a church server in the village of Anginskoye, Verkholensk District, Irkutsk Province, in Russia. His father, Evsey Popov, died when Ivan was six, and Ivan lived with his uncle, the parish deacon, in Anga. In 1807 at age 10, Ivan entered the Irkutsk Theological Seminary,\\"His Grace, Bishop Innocent (Veniaminov) of Alaska\\", Orthodox Church in America where the rector renamed him Veniaminov in honor of the recently deceased Bishop Veniamin of Irkutsk. In 1817, he married a local priest's daughter named Catherine. On May 18 that year, Ivan Veniaminov was ordained a deacon of the Church of the Annunciation in Irkutsk. After completing his studies in 1818, Veniaminov was appointed a teacher in a parish school. On May 18, 1821 he was ordained a priest to serve in the Church of the Annunciation in Irkutsk. In Russian he was known as Father Ioann, the religious version of Ivan. Ministry in Alaska At the beginning of 1823, Bishop Michael of Irkutsk received instructions to send a priest to the island of Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Father Ioann Veniaminov volunteered to go and on May 7, 1823 he departed from Irkutsk, accompanied by his aging mother, his brother Stefan, his wife, and their son, Innocent, an infant. After a difficult yearlong journey by land and water, they arrived at Unalaska on July 29, 1824. After Father Ioann and his family built and moved into an earthen hut, he set about studying the local languages and dialects. He trained some of his new parishioners in Russian building techniques. With them he undertook the construction of Holy Ascension Church,Sister Ioanna, \\"Life of St. Innocent of Alaska\\", St. Innocent of Alaska Monastic Community, Redford, Michigan which was finished the following July. Metropolitan of Moscow. Father Ioann's parish included the island of Unalaska and the neighboring groups of Fox and Pribilof islands,Garrett, Paul D., “Innocent, Veniaminov (Ivan Popov-Veniaminov)”, Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, (ed. Gerald H. Anderson), New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 1998, p. 320 occupied by indigenous people who had been converted to Christianity before his arrival. They also retained many of their earlier religious beliefs and customs. Father Ioann often traveled between the islands in a canoe, battling the stormy ocean in the Gulf of Alaska. By his travels through the islands, Father Ioann Veniaminov became familiar with the local dialects. In a short time he mastered six of the dialects. He devised an alphabet using Cyrillic letters for the most widely used dialect, the Unangan dialect of Aleut. In 1828, he translated portions of the Bible and other church material into that dialect. In 1829, he journeyed to the Bering Sea coast of the Alaskan mainland and preached to the people there. In 1834, Father Ioann was transferred to Sitka Island, to the town of Novoarkhangelsk, later called Sitka. He devoted himself to the Tlingit people and studied their language and customs. From his studies there, he wrote the scholarly works Notes on the Kolushchan and Kodiak Tongues and Other Dialects of the Russo-American Territories, with a Russian-Kolushchan Glossary. Kamchatka ministry Contemporary portrait of Bishop Innocent. In 1838, Father Ioann journeyed to St. Petersburg (where on Christmas Day 1839 he was promoted to archpriest), Moscow and Kiev to report on his activities and request an expansion of the Church's activities in Russian America. While he was there, he received notice that his wife had died during her visit to Irkutsk. He requested permission to return to his hometown. Instead, church officials suggested that he take vows as a monk. Father Ioann at first ignored these suggestions, but, on November 29, 1840, he was tonsured a monk with the name Innocent in honor of Saint Innocent, the first bishop of Irkutsk (†1731, commemorated on November 26). He was elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. On December 15, 1840, Archimandrite Innocent was consecrated Bishop of Kamchatka and Kuril Islands in Russia and the Aleutian Islands in Russian America. His see was located in Novoarkhangelsk (Sitka), to which he returned in September 1841. He spent the next nine years administering his diocese as well as taking several long missionary journeys to its remote areas. On April 21, 1850, Bishop Innocent was elevated to Archbishop. In 1852 the Yakut area was admitted to the Kamchatka Diocese. In September 1853 Archbishop Innocent took up permanent residence in the town of Yakutsk. Innocent took frequent trips throughout his enlarged diocese. He devoted much energy to the translation of the scriptures and service books into the Yakut (Sakha) language. In April 1865 Archbishop Innocent was appointed a member of the Holy Governing Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. Metropolitan of Moscow On November 19, 1867, he was appointed the Metropolitan of Moscow, succeeding his friend and mentor, Saint Filaret, who had died. As metropolitan, he undertook revisions of many church texts that contained errors, raised funds to improve the living conditions of impoverished priests, and established a retirement home for clergy. Death and legacy Trinity-Sergius Monastery in Sergiyev Posad, Russia Innocent died on March 31, 1879. He was buried on April 5, 1879 at Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra, outside Moscow.  Sainthood  On the Russian Orthodox Church, acting on the official request of the Orthodox Church in America, glorified (canonized) Innocent as a saint, giving him the title \\"Enlightener of the Aleuts, Apostle to America.\\" Innocent's feast day is celebrated by the Orthodox Church three times a year: March 31, the date of his repose according to the Julian Calendar (April 13 N.S.); October 6, the anniversary of his canonization (September 23 O.S.); and October 18, the Synaxis of the Moscow Hierarchs (October 5 O.S.).

It stars Penelope Ann Miller, Eric Thal, William Forsythe, Cathy Moriarty and Alfre Woodard. Rock and roll recording pioneer Cordell Jackson played a bit part as \\"Bathroom Woman\\". The film was distributed by Touchstone Pictures for Interscope Communications. Plot Betty Lou Perkins is a meek librarian in New Orleans who nobody pays much attention to, in particular her husband, Alex. A criminal kingpin is killed in cold blood, and Betty Lou happens to find the murder gun. She is so mousy, however, that she cannot even get the police to listen to her, including Alex, who is a detective. In sheer frustration, she not only produces the gun, but also announces that she is the one who committed the crime. Behind bars, Betty Lou meets a variety of hardened and colorful characters. Rather than intimidate her, they actually increase her self- confidence. Once she is released, she begins to dress, speak, and act differently. Unfortunately for her, criminal acquaintances of the victim assume she must have confessed to the murder for a reason. They conclude she must be his mistress, and soon, the bad guys want a few words with her ... or worse.
