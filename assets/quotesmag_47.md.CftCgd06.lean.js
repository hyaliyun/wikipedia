Between 2003-04, he spent nearly a year living in Baghdad, Iraq where he reported on the capture of Saddam Hussein and the growing insurgency in Iraq. He was part of a team which won an Emmy for their coverage. Stone joined Sky News in 2005 working first as a producer before switching to reporting in 2007. In 2012 he became the network's Asia Correspondent, based in Beijing, China. In 2015 he moved to Brussels, Belgium as the network's Europe Correspondent. Stone has reported from a wide number of locations in the UK and around the world, from the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya to the 2011 riots in London. He was one of the first British journalists to ‚Äòembed‚Äô with the British Army in Afghanistan's Helmand Province in July 2006. He met the former KGB spy, Alexander Litvinenko in London, two weeks before he was poisoned. He covered Mr. Litvinenko's death and its wider implications in detail. In 2011, he spent 6 weeks reporting extensively from Libya on the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, the NATO intervention and the subsequent death of Muammar Gaddafi. He is one of a small number of journalists to have attended almost every session of Britain's Iraq Inquiry giving him an extensive knowledge of the war in Iraq and the decisions behind it. In August 2011, Stone played a widely reported and important role in Sky News coverage of the London riots. In one of the first examples of the use of mobile devices for newsgathering, Stone used just an iPhone, rather than relying upon the usual accompaniment of a professional television crew, to record and broadcast scenes of arson and his own confrontation with looters, which both led Sky News bulletins and were covered widely by broadcasters around the world. Online, within 24 hours, his videos had been viewed by nearly a million people. He was nominated and shortlisted for an award by the Royal Television Society for his innovative coverage of the riots, and was praised in the media for his handling of the news coverage.Mark Stone Asia Correspondent Publisher: Sky News.

They had been filming a report about the 1989 protests and were then detained after being accused of not having the right accreditation. They broadcast live from a police van as it drove them away for questioning. They were released after several hours of interrogation. In July 2013, Stone travelled to North Korea as part of a select group of journalists granted access to the reclusive country. He and his Sky News team produced the first ever live international broadcasts from events at locations around the capital Pyongyang, allowing viewers a real-time glimpse inside North Korea. Stone was a key part of Sky's extensive coverage of the disappearance of Malaysia Airline Flight MH370 in 2014. He provided extensive coverage of Europe's migration crisis between 2015 and 2017. Since 2017 his main focus has been on Brexit from Sky News's Europe Bureau in Brussels. In May 2019 Sky announced that Stone will become the network's Middle East Correspondent.

Biography Irina Petra≈ü graduated from high school in Agnita in 1965, and from the Faculty of Letters of the Babe»ô- Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca in 1970. She earned a PhD in Romanian literature with the thesis entitled: Camil Petrescu, the Fiction Writer/Camil Petrescu, prozatorul (1980). She was editor of the Didactic and Pedagogic Publishing House (coordinator of the ‚ÄúAkademos‚Äù collection: 1990-1999), editor-in-chief of Casa CƒÉr≈£ii de ≈ûtiin≈£ƒÉ Publishing House, Cluj-Napoca (1999-2012). Currently she is president of the Cluj branch of the Writers' Union of Romania (since 2005). Publishing activity Irina Petra≈ü's first published book was Proza lui Camil Petrescu (Camil Petrescu‚Äôs Fiction) (1981). She has published four essays on the theme of death, two prominent ones are ≈ûtiin≈£a mor≈£ii (The Knowledge of Death) (1995) and Moartea la purtƒÉtor. StƒÉri »ôi cuvinte (Death by Proxy. Moods and Words) (2012). Drawing on suggestions from well-known works on death by Philippe Ari√®s, Georges Bataille, Edgar Morin, Emmanuel L√©vinas, Jean Ziegler, Louis Vincent Thomas, Vladimir Jank√©l√©vitch, Jean Baudrillard, etc., but also by Emil Cioran, Ion Biberi and Mircea Eliade, Petra≈ü's essays approach the problem of finitude from an innovative and unprejudiced perspective. She selects and comments freely upon statements concerning the state of deadness, emphasizing various facets of key ideas, almost turning them into leitmotifs: death is a process, not a one-off event; intravital death is worth all the manifestations of life and it alone gives them meaning and importance; a reform of death would restore the dignity of man, who is now lost under the pressure of deceptive dogmas; the mortal condition, as the supreme sign of humanness, can become a force; ‚Äúthe immortal‚Äù ‚Äì either ‚Äúthe new man‚Äù of totalitarian systems or the serene and irresponsible ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù of post-industrial society ‚Äì endangers not only the quality of life, but the very existence of humankind. Man's subjection to the dictates of fate is a necessary evil, and one that makes it possible for him to value his passing life; the only salvation that man has is art, creation. Petra≈ü has also published several books on femininity and the so-called ‚Äúsexuate regard‚Äù of the Romanian language. Her work, Feminitatea limbii rom√¢ne. Genosanalize (The Femininity of the Romanian Language ‚Äì Gender Analyses), takes its cue from one of Eminescu's famous phrases: the language, our mistress. The book is built on the assumption that one's mother tongue influences one's Worldview. The first section, Worlds and Words, focuses research on the noun (Hauptwort in German) and its genders. Thus, the Romanian language reveals its ‚Äúsexual focus‚Äù. Its femininity (there are mostly feminine nouns that provide the definition of the Romanian dimension of being), with its obvious bias towards androgyny (the Romanian language does not have a neutral gender, but rather an ambigenus that names things with a ‚Äúdouble personality‚Äù, androgynously), could explain many characteristics of the Romanian man. The second section, Sexual focus and poetry (Gender Analyses), draws on examples from both Romanian and foreign language poetry to support the idea that the gender of nouns organizes the written space, contributes specific nuances to the poetic perspective and deepens the particular manner in which each language represents the world. Petra≈ü is also known for her books on Romanian literature (see the thousand-plus page work Contemporary Romanian Literature. A Panorama). She has published many dictionaries and handbooks in the field of literary theory. Petra≈ü has also translated extensively from English and French into Romanian (Henry James, Marcel Moreau, Jacques De Decker, Jean-Luc Outers, Michel Haar, G. K. Chesterton, D. H. Lawrence, Guy de Maupassant, Anatole France, Mac Linscott Ricketts, Philip Roth, Michel Lambert, Philippe Jones etc.) She was married to the writer Petru PoantƒÉ.

It is based on the novel A Monkey in Winter by Antoine Blondin. Set in a Normandy seaside town, it recounts the meeting and parting of two men at odds with life, one an old hotel keeper who dreams of dashing deeds in pre-war China and the other a young advertising executive who imagines he is an incarnation of Hispanic masculinity. Plot With his dutiful but unimaginative wife Suzanne, Albert Quentin runs a small hotel in a little town on the coast of Normandy. After an exciting career as a marine in the French Navy, during which he served in China, he is bored and takes to drink. In June 1944 he is on a binge with his neighbour Esnault, who runs a bar, when the Allies launch a huge air raid. Finding his way back to his cellar, he comforts his terrified wife there and promises her that if their hotel stays intact he will give up drink. After fifteen years of sobriety, and more bored than ever, on a quiet winter night a nervous young man books in to the hotel. This is Gabriel Fouquet, who goes over to Esnault's bar and after ringing his wife who has left him and gone to Madrid, gets thoroughly drunk. Albert, who gets up to bring him in from the street and put him to bed, warms to the lonely stranger. Each has a dream world into which he retreats from reality: Albert relives and embellishes his exotic adventures in China, while Gabriel sees himself as an epitome of Spanish machismo, dancing flamenco and fighting bulls. In the morning, Gabriel buys a sweater for a ten-year-old girl from an eccentric shopkeeper called Landru and visits the convent where his daughter Marie is a boarder. Too on edge to see her, he runs away when she is called. Albert and Suzanne in their different ways try to be kind to him, but he will keep drinking and causing upsets. One fateful night Albert succumbs and the two get roaring drunk. They start a fight in Esnault's bar, visit a brothel Albert has not entered for fifteen years, though only to drink, and cajole the shopkeeper Landru into setting off his stock of fireworks on the beach. When they force their way into the convent to abduct Marie, they are confronted by the head nun in a wheelchair, who repels them and says Marie will be released at ten in the morning. Gabriel collects his daughter then and the two are joined on the Paris train by a chastened Albert, who has once more renounced alcohol and is going to visit his father's grave inland. Albert tells Marie how in China lost monkeys creep into the towns during winter and, once there are enough of them, the people organise a train to take them all back to their native forests. He gets out at Lisieux, to face his own long winter.

For nearly four decades he was the general manager of the Finnish heavy vehicle producer Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT). His contribution to national development was officially recognized by the Finnish President who appointed Nessling as a \\"Vuorineuvos\\". Nessling became head of SAT in 1932, soon after the company's foundation. He developed the business in an era when only few believed in the possibility of a Finnish automotive industry, and a decade later had become the company's majority shareholder. Nessling took a patriarchal approach to his leadership of the company, which he built into a producer of trucks, bus chassis, rail vehicles and specialist terminal tractors. Nessling lost his controlling shareholding following a merger in 1968, resigned in 1970 and died the following year.  Studies and early career  Nessling's parents were engineer John Nessling and Greta n√©e Gr√∂nholm. Nessling did his abitur at the Helsinki coeducational (Swedish language) grammar school in 1920. He continued his studies at the Mechanical Engineering Faculty of the Helsinki University of Technology: simultaneously he studied Geology at the University of Helsinki between 1922 and 1924. Nessling graduated as a diplomi-insin√∂√∂rithe Finnish equivalent of an MSc in Mechanical Engineering in 1924. He traveled in Sweden, the UK, Germany and the USA, and between 1926 and 1928 Nessling worked successively for three Finnish automobile import companies Korpivaara & Halla, Henry-Auto and Auto-Bil. He worked as manager in the auto-business with Munkkisaaren Autotalli ja Konepaja from 1928 to 1929 and then with Autovarikko between 1929 and 1930.  Formation of Suomen Autoteollisuus  In 1929, Nessling was appointed Technical Manager of the bus and coach builder Autoteollisuus-Bilindustri. Nessling wanted to develop a new branch of industry for his country and in the same year he became interested in starting a lorry and bus industry in Finland. Autoteollisuus‚ÄìBilindustri put together its activities with another coachbuilder Osakeyhti√∂ Autokoritehdas in 1931. The name of the new company was Suomen Autoteollisuus (Finnish Auto-industry) and its first General Manager was John Hellsten. It is often claimed that Nessling was a founder of SAT: he was not. The operation was organised by Karl Arthur Nordgr√©n, Emil Anton Winckelmann and Lars Wilhelm √Öberg. However, the year after the company's creation Nessling was appointed General Manager of the SAT. S-321 from 1932. Starting a vehicle construction business virtually from scratch in the middle of a recession seemed impossible, but under Nessling's determined leadership that is what was achieved. The vehicle brand selected was Sisu, and the first 12 Sisu vehicles rolled out from the factory in 1932. Although the level of domestic content was just 20% at the beginning Nessling was determined to increase this substantially. Famously, he liked to say, \\"A Finn is capable of making anything which a foreigner can make.\\" By the end of the 1930s, Sisu vehicles contained 40% local content. Nessling strongly lobbied the Finnish government about the growth potential of automotive industry, stressing the employment potential and also the strategic significance of Finnish controlled vehicle production for national defence. However, the government ignored his arguments and progressively cut the import tariffs on heavy vehicles during the 1930s, making competition for the domestic industry more intense. In addition, some of the owners of SAT began to doubt the prospects for domestic heavy vehicle production. Nessling offered to buy from Helsingin Osakepankki its shares in SAT in 1938. He obtained the shares cheaply, but to finance the bargain he nevertheless had to pledge his wife's entire property. Eventually, Nessling ended up owning 80% of SAT.  Second World War and Yhteissisu  Sisu S-22 made by Yhteissisu (ca 1947) The Second World War brought new challenges to SAT because many foreign components became unobtainable. The degree of domestic content could be increased to 90%, though only with much effort. A big step forward came with the start of American Hercules engine production under licence. Principle customers for SAT during the war were the Finnish Defence Forces and other government institutions. SAT started building a new factory in Karis, where it would be less vulnerable to Soviet air raids than Helsinki. The production capacity was not adequate to meet the demand; in 1942, the Defence Forces estimated that they would need 7,000 lorries and buses in the next few years. Nessling suggested building the Karis factory larger than had originally been planned. However, SAT's economic and technical resources were limited, and influential heavy vehicle importers, supported by some political factions, suspected that SAT was exploiting the war to benefit unfairly and gain a dominant position in the Finnish market. The government suggested an arrangement in which SAT would have become partly state owned. Nessling ruled this option out, however, he did not want the state to be involved in SAT. The fall-back option was creation of another company with support of the state and some significant Finnish companies. Such a company, Yhteissisu, was formed in 1943 and Tor Nessling, most reluctantly, found himself installed its General Manager. Yhteissisu started building Sisu lorries in Vanaja, some 100 km (63 miles) to the north of Helsinki. But war gave way to peace before Yhteissisu's capability to build military trucks had come fully on stream. Nessling left his post with Yhteissisu in 1946, complaining of lack of support from the company owners. Yhteissisu lorry production was redirected to the civilian market, and in 1948 the company was renamed \\"Vanajan Autotehdas\\" (VAT). By now, Nessling was becoming increasingly embittered with the Finnish government. First his ideas about domestic heavy vehicle production were ignored in the 1930s, and then the government had forced through the creation of a powerful competitor which had established itself by using technology developed by Nessling's company. Disenchantment with the politicians was in evidence when the government offered Nessling beneficial funding opportunities in the 1960s: he replied that he had never requested, and would never ask for anything from the government.  Post-war growth of SAT  Production of SAT grew strongly in the 1950s and 1960s; the volumes quadrupled to 800 vehicles per year during the 1950s. In addition to producing lorries and bus chassis, the company provided trams and rail vehicles to the Finnish State Railways. SAT products were exported to four continents. The growing volumes both required and benefited from investment in production facilities and sales and marketing campaigns. Unlike many contemporary industrialists, Nessling valued marketing, and he focused closely on identifying, understanding and satisfying customer needs.  Merger with VAT and resignation  SAT's leading domestic competitor, Vanajan Autotehdas, was in financial trouble by end of the 1960s. Nessling proposed a merger between Vanajan Autotehdas and SAT because he was afraid that a foreign competitor, such as Volvo or Scania, would otherwise take over Vanajan Autotehdas. The companies came together in 1968. In the end, the merger led to a situation that Nessling had wanted to avoid: the state became a part-owner of the new SAT with a 17% shareholding and Nessling lost his controlling majority as his own holding fell to below 50%. SAT acquired an executive board of directors and a supervisory board. Although Nessling was still the company's principal shareholder, his influence was diminished: he had very little recent experience of receiving orders or of operating with a board of directors, and he found adapting to the new situation difficult. Relations between Nessling and the board got worse when Nessling fell ill. He recovered, but not sufficiently to be able to work as before, although he was keen to continue with his role in the company management. The board was not convinced and reorganised the company structure. Nessling resisted the transfer of marketing responsibilities to other hands but could not prevent it. Nessling's old business partner and friend, then head of British Leyland Motor Corporation, Lord Stokes, whom Nessling greatly respected, eventually persuaded him to step aside. Tor Nessling announced his resignation as General Manager of Suomen Autoteollisuus in June 1970, after leading the company for nearly four decades. Erik Gillberg was appointed the new General Manager in February 1971.  Personal life and death  Nessling worked hard and shunned the limelight. He worked closely with a small number of trusted colleagues, but many colleagues and underlings remembered his leadership style as patriarchal and distant. He resisted delegating decisions. He is described as a brilliant businessman who had the ability to spot business opportunities, but he was also a quick tempered, and was found by some to be excessively risk-averse. The tough industrialist also had his softer side: he liked nature and animals, and he kept many pets at his home. Nessling had married Greta Maria \\"Maj\\" (n√©e Kock) in 1926 who stayed home as a housewife while supporting her husband in his career. The marriage was childless, and when Nessling died in 1971 his widow sold the family share in SAT. In 1972 she bequeathed their property to establish the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation. The foundation is a significant funder of environmental research in Finland.

Production and release Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick (director of American University's Nuclear Studies Institute) began working on the project in 2008. Stone, Kuznick and British screenwriter Matt Graham co-wrote the script. The documentary miniseries for Showtime had a working title Oliver Stone's Secret History of America. Kuznick objected to the working title \\"Secret History\\", claiming that \\"the truth is that many of our 'secrets' have been hidden on the front page of the New York Times. If people think the secrets will be deep, dark conspiracies, they'll be disappointed. We'll be drawing on the best recent scholarship\\". It was subsequently retitled The Untold History of the United States. The series covers \\"the reasons behind the Cold War with the Soviet Union, U.S. President Harry Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, and changes in America's global role since the fall of Communism.\\" Stone is the director and narrator of ten regular episodes and two prologue episodes. The series is a reexamination of some of the underreported and darkest parts of American modern history, using little-known documents and newly uncovered archival material. The series looks beyond official versions of events to the deeper causes and implications and explores how events from the past still have resonant themes for the present day. Stone said, \\"From the outset I've looked at this project as a legacy to my children and a way to understand the times I've lived through. I hope it can contribute to a more global insight into our American history.\\" The first three episodes of the series premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 6, 2012, with Indiewire describing them as \\"extremely compelling\\" and \\"daring.\\" The series was personally presented by Stone at the Subversive Festival on May 4, 2013, in Zagreb, Croatia, which next to film screenings also included debates and public lectures by prominent intellectuals such as Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and Tariq Ali. Stone described the project as \\"the most ambitious thing I've ever done. Certainly in documentary form, and perhaps in fiction, feature form.\\" Production took four years to complete. Stone confessed, \\"It was supposed to take two years, but it's way over schedule\\". The premiere was finally set for November 12, 2012. Stone spent $1 million of his own money on the film as the budget inflated from $3 million to $5 million. Regarding the program's accuracy, Stone told TV host Tavis Smiley: \\"This has been fact checked by corporate fact checkers, by our own fact checkers, and fact checkers [hired] by Showtime. It's been thoroughly vetted... these are facts, our interpretation may be different than orthodox, but it definitely holds up.\\" The series premiered on Showtime in November 2012. The executive producers were Oliver Stone, Tara Tremaine and Rob Wilson. The Untold History of the United States was released on Blu-ray on October 15, 2013. All ten episodes of the show are featured on four discs, and the Blu-ray release also includes various bonus content, as well as two prologue episodes. The first prologue episode deals with World War I, the Russian Revolution and Woodrow Wilson. The second prologue episode highlights the pre-World War II era of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. The series was released on DVD on March 4, 2014. Companion book The ten-part series is supplemented by a 750-page companion book, The Untold History of the United States, also written by Stone and Kuznick, released on Oct 30, 2012 by Simon & Schuster. Audiobook The audiobook was released by Brilliance Publishing on June 4, 2013. The Untold History of the United States audiobook was also written by Stone and Kuznick, narrated by Peter Berkrot. It runs 36 hours and 25 minutes. Style and format The series has been said to be reminiscent of the famed British Thames Television series The World at War (1973‚Äì74). With the exception of an on-camera introduction and conclusion by Oliver Stone, the series contains no interview subjects. Instead, each episode consists of archival material: stock film, photographs, video and audio recordings, computer generated maps and diagrams, clips from fictional movies, and Stone's voiceover narration. Historical quotations and writings from various figures are read by voice actors. List of movies and TV shows used Oliver Stone used clips from about 60 fictional movies and TV shows over the course of The Untold History of the United States. He used them as a vehicle for telling stories of specific topics during given episodes. Critical reception In 2012, The Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald highly recommended the series and book, describing it as \\"riveting\\", \\"provocative\\" and \\"worthwhile\\". Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev wrote approvingly of the book: > Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick provide a critical overview of US foreign > policy during the past few decades. ... Such a perspective is indispensable > at a time when decisions are being taken that will shape America's role in > the global world of the twenty-first century. At stake is whether the United > States will choose to be the policeman of a \\"Pax Americana\\", which is a > recipe for disaster, or partner with other nations on the way to a safer, > more just and sustainable future. David Wiegand wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle: \\"The films are at their best when they provide a panoramic view of our history in the middle part of the 20th century. Ably abetted by the superb editing work by Alex Marquez\\". Verne Gay for Newsday similarly praised the craft: \\"By far the most interesting part of 'Untold' is the visual presentation. Stone has cobbled together a mother lode of chestnuts, including grainy newsreel footage and Soviet propaganda films. It's all weirdly engrossing\\" but found the content less than provocative: \\"You keep waiting for a fresh insight, a new twist, a bizarre fact and after a while would even be profoundly grateful for some wacky Stone revisionism. It never comes. What's 'untold' here?\\" In November 2012, historian Ronald Radosh of the conservative Hudson Institute (who was averse to the project from its announcement and encouraged a write-in campaign to cancel the series) lambasted it as \\"mendacious\\" Cold War revisionism and \\"mindless recycling of Stalin's propaganda,\\" claiming similarities to Communist author and NKVD agent Carl Marzani's Soviet-published treatise We Can Be Friends. Radosh wrote: > Over and over, Stone uses the same quotations, the same arrangements of > material, and the same arguments as Marzani. This is not to accuse Stone of > plagiarism, only to point out that the case he now offers as new was argued > in exactly the same terms by an American Communist and Soviet agent in 1952. Journalist Michael C. Moynihan criticized the book for \\"moral equivalence between the policies of the psychotically brutal Soviet Union and the frequently flawed policy of the United States\\" and called the title \\"misleading\\" in that nothing within the book was \\"untold\\" previously. Moynihan also claimed factual errors and questionable sources. In 2013, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz also remarked that the book and films \\"have a misleading title\\" and that \\"Most if not all of the interpretations that they present... have appeared in revisionist histories of American foreign policy written over the last fifty years\\".Wilentz, Sean (2013), ‚ÄúCherry-Picking Our History‚Äù; New York Review of Books, (21 February issue) Wilentz went on to say: > Although the book by Stone and Kuznick is heavily footnoted, the > sourcing...recalls nothing so much as Dick Cheney‚Äôs cherry-picking of > intelligence, particularly about the origins and early years of the cold > war. ... This book is less a work of history than a skewed political > document... Untold History Education Project In October 2013, Stone, Kuznick, and Eric Singer launched the Untold History Education Project to expand upon the narratives and events discussed in the Untold History documentary series and book. The project is devoted to fostering critical thinking and debate amongst students and teachers in high schools and universities. With the input of educators and historians, Stone, Kuznick and Singer also designed a curriculum guide for the series and primary source-based lesson plans for each episode.

He has been called \\"The greatest preacher in the English speaking world.\\"Warren W. Wiersbe, 50 People Every Christian Should Know, Baker Books  Early life  Jowett was born 25 August 1864 at Beaumont Town, Northowram in Halifax, West Yorkshire to working-class parents who attended the Congregational church in Halifax. Jowett's father was a tailor and draper.  Career and influence  Jowett was influenced by Enoch Mellor who was incumbent at Square Road Congregational Church, Halifax, between 1867 and 1881, and determined to become a preacher. Jowett understood the problems faced by workers and while the pastor at Carr's Lane Congregational Church in Birmingham, England, founded the Digbeth Institute, now an arts center. While at Carr's Lane Jowett was elected chairman of the Congregational Union and president of the National Council of Evangelical Free Churches. Jowett served at the Presbyterian Church, Fifth Avenue, New York, from 1911 to 1918, then Westminster Chapel from 1918 to 1922, when he retired due to ill-health, and died the following year.

History Accra High School was founded by the late Rev. James Thomas Roberts on 17 August 1923. The school, was located at beach avenue in Aayalolo, a suburb of Accra, Ghana. The school celebrated its first anniversary in August 1924 with a church service at the Holy Trinity Cathedral, Accra and the sermon was delivered by the Anglican Bishop of Accra, the late Dr. John Aglionby. Thus, there was a tie between the school and the Church of England. In 1924, the school entered its first candidates for the college of preceptors as well as for the Cambridge University, the royal society of Arts and Pitman's Shorthand Examinations in the United Kingdom. In 1926, most of the pupils sat and passed the junior Cambridge Examination. In that year, Mr. Frank Roberts, the eldest son of Rev. Roberts, joined the staff after graduating in Bachelor of Arts from the United Kingdom. He worked hard to enhance the Academic and Disciplinary standard of the school in Accra. In 1927, the late J.O. Ansah Johnson became the first student to pass the Cambridge School Certificate Examination. In 1931, members of staff and students performed Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with tremendous success and this was followed in 1932 with further excellent performances. Before the founding of Accra High School, the only Secondary Grammar School in Accra, the Accra grammar school, had closed down. However Rev. Roberts had massive support of some men of the highest intellectual and moral calibre. Most of these scholars were Lawyers, Doctors, Civil servants and merchants who had their University education in the United Kingdom. Rev Roberts was ably assisted by Barristers J.A. Glover-Addo, Harry Riberio, E.O. Quist and G. Akilakpa Sawyer, Dr.E.V. Nanka-Bruce and Messrs J.A. Vanderpuye, John Backman, S.O. Akiwumi, A. J. Ocansey, J. P. Garshong and Charles Kojo Bruce. So the school continued to excel and achieve successes in its educational effort. 1952 Accra High School was granted official recognition by the Government and became a Government Public School. In the year (1952), Rev. Roberts retired at the age of 81. The mantle of headship then fell on Mr. W.F. Conton who ran the school from 1952 to 1956. Mr. Conton was succeeded by Mr. P.O. Sanful, Snr. who ran the school from 1956 to 1966. It was during the headship of Mr. Sanful that Rev. Roberts, the founder and retired Headmaster, died on 5 September 1964, at the age of 94. Accra High school grew from strength to strength and by 1964, the school had expanded from a two-stream to a three-stream school and the enrolment had doubled from 300 to 600 with a teaching staff of 27. A 9 hectare plot of land had been acquired by Government of Ghana for a new Building at North Ridge near the West African Examinations Council and the German Embassy in Accra. By September 1967 the school was relocated when a fifteen-unit classroom block was completed together with a two-storey science block. 1967, Mr. A.N.B Andrews, had then taken over from Mr. Sanful Snr. as headmaster. Mr. Andrews leadership saw further developments in infrastructure such as a ten-unit classroom block, a home science block, a technical block and an administration block, a library and a staff common room, a cafeteria and a students hostel to house the six form student preparing for their A-level examinations. All these were in place by the end of the 1976 academic year. In October 1976, Mr. Andrews left the school on promotion to Ghana Education Service Headquarters as director for schools and colleges. His departure coincided with the grant of sixth form status to the school which he worked hard for. Mr. D.R. Essah who was the assistant headmaster acted for a year during the 1976‚Äì77 academic year before handing over to Mr. P.O. Sanful, Jnr. As the substantive Head in September, 1977. Mr. Sanful ran the school until September, 1986. Mr Sanful did the pioneering work in Sixth Form Education and a Boarding School System at Accra High School. In January, 1987, Mr. E.B. Dogbe became the new Headmaster. He was a person full of discipline and Principles and kept his words. Punctuality was the order of the day. He retired in November 1996 and handed over to Mr. Ben. Nikoi koteye as the substantive Headmaster, in whose term the school celebrated its 75th (Diamond Jubilee) with great pomp and gaiety. A monument was raised by the old students to commemorate the occasion. Under his headship, the school achieved very remarkable academic results. There was cordiality among the staff and moral was also high among teacher and students. His period saw parents changing their attitude towards the welfare of their children, leading to a vibrant Parent Teacher Association which led subsequent Development in the school. He also saw the landscaping of the compound. In April 1999 upon the retirement of Mr. Ben Koteye, the mantle fell on Mrs. Sylvia Asempa, the first female to head the school. She continued the good works that her predecessors had set in motion. It was during her time that Accra Ring Road central with support from the Rotary foundation of Rotary International constructed a multi-purpose playing court on the reclaimed waterlogged triangle of the school. She was also the first bilingual Headteacher of Accra High School. She spoke fluent French hence the further development of the French as a foreign Language in the school. The P.T.A. Converted the basement of the existing school flat into two, two bedroom unit for staff occupation as well as the establishment of a 150 million computer laboratory for the school. It is worthy of note that some old students also contributed some of the facilities used in the computer lab. Mrs. Asempa was later transferred to Aburi Girls Secondary School to continue her excellent work. Under the administration, the bust of the founder was erected on the fore court of the administration block. In March 2002, Accra High School was blessed with yet another dynamic headmaster in the person of Mr. E.A. Kissiedu. Although he has been head for a brief period, he has re- equipped the chemistry and the physics labs, paved the alley in front of the classroom complex, upgraded office equipment sourced new computers for the internet security and constructed of kerbs along the road from the gate to the quadrangle to prevent the perennial erosion. His interest in the promotion of sports has boosted the moral of sports in Boys and Girls in the school. He handed over to Mr. Isaac Ohimeng Gyebi who served from 2006 to 2011. The school is currently headed by Mrs Betty Aduhene-Chinbuah who took over in 2011. Under her leadership, the school is pursuing a redevelopment agenda, with the active support of the alumni (AHISCOSA), to offer the school a facelift and ensure that AHISCO regains its past glory. Presently, the school runs five programmes, namely: general arts, general science, technical, business, visual art and home economics. The school also houses a science resource centre, French centre bureau de co-ordination nationale des cref and a completed office complex for the Ghana Education Service Council. AHISCO, the first secondary school in Accra, is noted for academic excellence, student discipline, sporting talents and excellent marching skills at independence parades.

It was once thought to have lived in the Atlantic Ocean around New Jersey. But now new evidence has shown that this species lives in starfish around the Asiatic Coast of the Pacific Ocean. Anatomy This species has now been proven to be very similar to those in the families Melanellidae-Entoconchidae, so it is not necessary to allocate it its own family as the taxonomist Thiele did in 1929. However, there are some similarities and some differences. The larva is a typical veliger with smaller lobes like the Melanellidae-Entoconchidae. However this larva has a pericardium and a kidney.

The firm has represented clients in First Amendment and Police misconduct cases, and numerous Critical Mass cyclists in both civil and criminal cases. The firm's founding partners are cyclists and members of the National Lawyers Guild. History  The firm was founded in 2008 by attorneys David B. Rankin and Mark C. Taylor, \\"two former Portland, Ore., bike messengers who kept their passion for biking after moving into the law.\\" They met as undergraduates at Reed College. Civil rights and First Amendment litigation The firm has worked on some notable Federal Civil Rights and First Amendment cases, and Rankin occasionally comments on civil rights issues for the New York Times and other news media. For example, the firm represented Tad Hirsch, creator of the TXTMob messaging service. Protestors used TXTmob to organize events during the 2004 Republican National Convention. When the New York City Law Department subpoenaed Hirsch's TXTmob records, Rankin argued that the subpoena was \\"vague\\" and \\"overbroad.\\" They further claimed that disclosing the information about TXTmob users who had nothing to do with lawsuits would violate their First Amendment and privacy rights. In 2010, the firm represented Said Hajem in a discrimination lawsuit against the NYPD. The firm argued that the NYPD's refusal to hire Hajem, despite his high scores on the police entrance exam was discrimination. In 2011, the firm represented Sojourner Hardeman in a federal civil rights lawsuit against the NYPD. Hardeman had been arrested numerous times for panhandling on Fifth Avenue. The firm argued that the arrests for disorderly conduct were without probable cause, and violated Hardeman's constitutional rights. In a judge-approved stipulation, the NYPD agreed not to arrest her without probable cause. The stipulation was described by the NY Times as \\"something of a feat.\\" The firm has also represented individuals in police misconduct lawsuits against the NYPD. Bicycling and freedom of assembly The firm's attorneys are cyclists and advocates for safer cycling in New York City. Rankin, along with Gideon Oliver (The Law Firm of Gideon Oliver) and Rose Weber (a solo practitioner), represented Critical Mass cyclists in a lawsuit against the New York City, alleging unlawful arrests. In 2010, the lawsuit led to a $965,000 payment from the city to the cyclists. This settlement figure did not include the many lawsuits filed by cyclists arrested during the Republican National Convention in 2004. The 2010 settlement came after the firm's participation in years of legal battles between cyclists and the NYPD. The firm represented Christopher Long, the cyclist assaulted by police officer Patrick Pogan during a 2008 Critical Mass bicycle ride. The video of the assault \\"became a viral presence on the Internet.\\" In a 2011 case, the firm's attorneys, along with civil rights lawyer Gideon Oliver of the law firm of Gideon Oliver, brought a class action suit on behalf of cyclists who have been improperly ticketed for \\"riding outside of the bike lane.\\" Rankin and Taylor are members of the National Lawyers Guild, a civil rights organization, and work with other National Lawyers Guild attorneys on mass-arrest cases. For example, the firm worked with the National Lawyers Guild on mass-defense strategies for Occupy Wall Street protestors at Zuccotti Park. In representing some of the 900 people arrested during the Occupy Wall Street protests, the firm worked with civil rights attorneys like Martin R. Stolar (of the law firm Martin Stolar) and Rebecca Heinegg (of the New York Law Collective). In addition, Taylor challenged the NYPD's use of barricades to pen in protestors. Taylor has served as vice president of the NYC Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild. Freedom of Information law The firm has represented clients in Freedom of Information Law litigation. For example, Taylor and Paula Z. Segal (of Rankin & Taylor) represented clients seeking information about the closure of Chase Plaza in downtown Manhattan, a formerly public space. Rankin and Taylor have worked to both unseal the names and records of bodies buried in New York City's Hart Island, and to increase access to the graves.

The particularity of Ressence‚Äôs patented time display system is that all graphical elements that form the dial lie in one co-planar surface very close under the sapphire glass, including the digits and the graphical hands. To indicate the time, the ‚Äòmechanical display module‚Äô is composed of discs and rings that orbit around each other. Functions of the first and second lines are: AM/PM, hours, minutes and seconds.

March 2011 (vol. 93). Because of the prominence of the minutes' hand, the watch is sometimes referred to as a regulator model. The co-planar rotating discs and rings are engraved and filled up with Super-LumiNova, although silver or titanium models with black versions of the material cannot be read in the dark despite the special paint. The automatic module uses a modified mechanical automatic Swiss Made caliber from ETA S.A. to power it.Livolsi, Megan. \\"Essence of Ressence\\", International Watch, pp. 41-42.

The use of rotating discs is no novelty per se, as in the 1970s various watches were introduced that used discs as opposed to hands to indicate time. Although few of these were popular, Seiko's limited edition \\"Discus Burger\\" from its 2007 \\"Moving Design\\" series ‚Äî more or less a copy of the SWA0017 model brought out by Swatch in 1994 but with an extra seconds disc ‚Äî continues to be very popular with collectors. The Discus Burger, which came out in black and white, uses discs with digital-type hour and minute markings that rotate on top of each other much like hands would. A small window at nine o'clock in the otherwise plain unmarked dial shows the time. Mintiens' idea of having the entire dial rotate clock-wise in which co- planar sub-dials with indexes orbit around a virtual axle was new. In 2010, Harry Winston introduced \\"Opus X\\" based on a comparable animation, but aesthetically and mechanically the concepts are different. One major difference lies in the fact that Opus X uses hands of different sizes and shapes to indicate time.Geelen, Frank. \\"Weekly Watch Photo ‚Äì Ressence\\", Monochrome, 8 May 2012.

Development The Ressence line was introduced at the BaselWorld watch fair in 2010, displaying 3 prototypes. During the spring of 2011 a first production of 50 watches, the so-called \\"ZeroSeries\\" was launched. In spring 2012 the \\"SeriesOne\\" was introduced. The latter series offered an upgrade to the zero series, with the omission of screws to hold the back sapphire, downturned lugs and a shock absorption system besides small changes to the time module. The ZeroSeries were assembled by VRJ in Waterloo, Belgium.Anon. \\"Made in Belgium\\", Knack no. 6, p. 37. 9 December 2010. For the assembly of SeriesOne, Ressence started collaboration with Montres Ludovic Ballouard in Geneva, Switzerland. At the World Exhibition in 2011 in Geneva (Geneva Time Exhibition) Ressence watches were awarded a ‚Äúspecial mention‚Äù from the jury. In 2012 it was also considered Watch of the Year for innovation by WatchPro.Bishop, Kathryn. \\"WOTY 2012: Innovation - Ressence Series One 1002\\", WatchPro, 8 August 2012. Retrieved on 4 January 2013. The third series, \\"Type 3\\", was introduced at the 2013 edition of the BaselWorld watch fair in May 2013. Because it is one of the first watches to come without a crown, CBS News's Techcrunch reported on the new model as a possible future direction in watches. In November 2013, the Ressence Type 3 was voted 2013 Men's Watch of the Year by the Belgian newspaper Le Soir and awarded the Horological Revelation Prize at the Grand Prix d‚ÄôHorlogerie de Gen√®ve.\\"The Ressence Type 3 Is The Liquid-Filled Watch Of The Future\\", CBS News, 22 April 2013.

Retrieved on 4 January 2013. In 2016, The Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie has certified that Ressence meets Haute Horlogerie standards of excellence, the techniques of watchmaking in symbiosis with the applied arts. The FHH assigned this evaluation to its Cultural Council of 46 independent, international experts who carried out their function with complete impartiality and on a pro bono basis. Type 1 At BaselWorld 2014, Ressence revealed a new line-up of Type 1 watches that have no crown, a slightly flatter case, and inwards-pointing lugs. The new lugs would fit smaller straps, an aspect indicating an intention to expand into the Asian market. Another important new feature was the functionality of the small indicator disc, which no longer indicates AM/PM, but, instead, the day of the week. To wind the watch, the bottom crystal must be rotated when the watch is placed upside down.\\"Ressence\\". At SIHH in 2017, a cushion-cased Type 1 Squared version of the watch was released. At 11.5mm it is the thinnest of all models yet and allows the time to be set using a retractable level. At the Basel watch fair later that year, a limited-edition (20 pcs) skeleton version of its \\"regular\\" Type 1 model was released in collaboration with NY-based watch website Hodinkee. Type 3 In 2013, Ressence revealed the 44mm Type 3. It features two separate sealed chambers, one filled with oil below the dial, and the other containing the base caliber filled with air. An extra side ring is added to indicate the days of the month. The upper half, which is filled with about 35 ml of oil, allows the lume indicators below the crystal to seemingly float on top of the crystal.

The film was released as Cousins in Love in the United Kingdom. Plot The story begins on 5 July 1939. The film opens with a narration by Julien, who states that he is going on 15, and that he is in love with his cousin Julia, and also that Julia's younger sister, Poune, is in love with him. His self-obsessed sister Claire is about to marry for money. He lives with his mother, who has taken on boarders due to financial difficulties: a German professor who fled the Nazis, his daughter, and a fading actress, Clementine. Julien constantly tries to win the attention of Julia, whilst Poune tries to win the attention of him. Julien gives Julia a Swiss army knife as a gift, though she shows little interest in it. She later gives it to Poune. Claire's fianc√©, Charles, shows interest in Julia. The professor continues his experiments into capturing a soul, whilst his daughter encourages Julien to pursue Julia. Julia writes of her interest in Charles in her diary, and talks of her pity for Julien, who she hopes will find a woman. Julien later confronts Julia and protests her friendship with Charles, to no avail. Charles takes Julia for a drive, but she rejects his sexual advances. Claire questions Charles about his relationship with Julia; Charles pleads ignorance. When Julien pranks Charles by releasing the brake in his car so that it rolls down a hill and is damaged, he is confined to his room. There, Mathilde, one of the maids, tries to seduce Julien, but Julien's mother catches her naked in his bed. Mathilde is sent away and is replaced by Madeleine. Charles immediately pursues Madeleine, and Poune and Julien write a note to Julia to get her into the barn at the time Charles has arranged to meet Madeleine. Julia catches Charles having sex with Madeleine and is furious at him. Clementine comforts Julia. The following day is Julia's 16th birthday party. The partygoers leave early, however, after it is discovered that Germany has declared war. Charles, the male servants, and Julien's father leave the home to go to war. The absence of the men creates extra work for Julien, the professor and the women. Julien, focused on work, loses interest in Julia. Clementine is informed she will have to leave the following week as her room has been rented. Exhausted from the previous day's work, Julien falls asleep in the hay and is awoken by Justine, one of the female servants. Justine asks Julien to undress her and then has sex with him. The next day the women are preparing breakfast for Julien. Justine attempts to take it to him however one of the other servants insists it is her turn. Julien is next seen kissing the naked servant girl. He coerces her into performing oral sex on him. Julia walks in on Julien and the servant girl. Julia slaps Julien in the face upon finding them; Julien replies that it is none of her business. Later Poune gives the Swiss army knife back to Julien, telling him that they are no longer friends. Julia tells Clementine she has decided to leave with her. Clementine tries to talk her out of it. Julien approaches Julia. The two argue; Julien tells Julia he is ashamed that he used to love her. The two fight, then wrestle on the ground before slowing down and eventually kissing. In the final scene Julien and Julia are lying naked together in the hay. Julia asks if he will give her the Swiss army knife again. In a cocky voice, Julien replies \\"Yeah sure, baby, sure\\" as he puts his clothes back on. Julia replies, \\"Don't speak to me like that.\\" Julien replies in the same tone \\"OK, baby.\\" Julia slaps him in the face, and the screen freeze-frames on Julien's shocked expression.

Radiation retinopathy has a delayed onset, typically after months or years of radiation, and is slowly progressive. In general, radiation retinopathy is seen around 18 months after treatment with external-beam radiation and with brachytherapy. The time of onset of radiation retinopathy is between 6 months to 3 years. An exposure to doses of 30-35 grays (Gy) or more is usually required to induce clinical symptoms, however, retinopathy may develop after as little as 15 Gy of external-beam radiation. A reported safe dose is : per week in five fractions of . Signs and symptoms Clinically, affected people may not have symptoms or may complain of decreased visual acuity. Ophthalmic examination may reveal signs of retinal vascular disease, including cotton-wool spots, retinal bleeds, microaneurysms, perivascular sheathing, capillary telangiectasis, macular edema, and disc edema. Capillary non perfusion, documented by fluorescein angiography, is commonly present, and extensive retinal ischemia can lead to neovascularization of the retina, iris, and disc. Staging of radiation retinopathy has been proposed. Pathophysiology Radiation retinopathy is very similar to other vascular diseases. Diabetes and radiation primarily damage the retinal capillaries. Diabetes results in early loss of pericytes and thickening of the basement membrane. Radiation however, damages the endothelial cells. Diagnosis Treatment The management of radiation retinopathy is similar to that for diabetic retinopathy and includes focal laser therapy to reduce macular edema or panretinal photocoagulation to treat zones of ischemia and neovascularization. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factors have been recently used for the treatment of radiation retinopathy. Monitoring of visual acuity in all cases and early referral to the ophthalmologist is warranted.

His son Gao Huaide was later a famed general in the succeeding Song Dynasty.  Background  Gao Xingzhou was born in 885, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. His family was originally from You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing), but his male-line ancestors had served for several generations (since his great-grandfather Gao Shunli () at Huairong Base () at Gui Prefecture (Â™ØÂ∑û, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), which belonged to Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered at You Prefecture), and Gao Xingzhou was born at the fortress at Huairong. Gao Xingzhou's father Gao Siji () and Gao Siji's two brothers (one older, one younger, whose names are lost to history) were all known in the region for being brave and capable in military matters. In 895, when the major warlord Li Keyong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan) was preparing to conquer Lulong, Li Keyong claimed to be avenging the prior military governor of Lulong, Li Kuangwei, as then-military governor of Lulong, Li Kuangchou, was a younger brother of Li Kuangwei's but had seized Li Kuangwei's circuit in a coup. The Gao brothers, believing in Li Keyong's assertions, joined the Hedong army and participated in the successful Hedong operations to conquer Lulong.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 48. After the Hedong army conquered Lulong, Li Keyong left the former Lulong officer Liu Rengong in command of Lulong, while leaving a Hedong army at Lulong to assist and guard Lulong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Liu made the Gao brothers the commanders of the forward, the middle, and the rear armies of Lulong, respectively, but either he himself (per the History of the Five Dynasties) or Li Keyong (per the New History of the Five Dynasties) was deeply suspicious of the Gao brothers, believing that they would eventually try to take over the circuit. Meanwhile, the Gao brothers imposed strict discipline on both the Lulong army and the Hedong soldiers that Li Keyong left at Lulong, and many were executed for violating laws. Li Keyong was displeased at the killing of the Hedong soldiers and complained to Liu. Liu blamed this on the Gao brothers, killing them. Wanting to appease the people of the circuit, however, as the Gao brothers were popular with the people, Liu made the Gao brothers' sons officers, and at the time, the more prominent one was Gao Xingzhou's cousin Gao Xinggui (), the son of Gao Siji's older brother. Gao Xingzhou was still young at the time, but was also made an officer. (Liu would eventually turn against Li Keyong, turning his Lulong Circuit into a domain independent of Li Keyong's.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 913, by which time Tang had fallen, and neither Li Keyong nor Liu Rengong was ruling his domain (by this time known respectively as the states of Jin and Yan) any more (Li Keyong had died in 908 and been succeeded by his son Li Cunxu as the Prince of Jin, while Liu Rengong had been overthrown by his son Liu Shouguang and put under arrest, with Liu Shouguang subsequently claiming the title of Emperor of Yan)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. the Jin army was launching a major attack on Yan. Gao Xinggui was then the prefect of Wu Prefecture (Ê≠¶Â∑û, in modern Zhangjiakou), and, unable to stand the attack of the Jin general (Li Cunxu's adoptive brother) Li Siyuan, surrendered Wu to Li Siyuan. When the major Yan general Yuan Xingqin heard this, he attacked Wu Prefecture. Gao Xinggui then sent Gao Xingzhou as a hostage to Li Siyuan and sought emergency aid. Li Siyuan, with Gao Xingzhou serving as his guide, was subsequently able to defeat Yuan, forcing Yuan's surrender. Subsequently, both Yuan and Gao Xingzhou remained as officers under Li Siyuan, with Gao and Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke often serving as commanders of Li Siyuan's personal guards.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. In 915, Li Cunxu was trying to build an elite guard corps serving under himself, and he requisitioned Yuan to serve as an officer of the corps. Li Siyuan felt compelled to allow Yuan to do so, and Li Cunxu subsequently gave Yuan the royal surname of Li, with a new name of Shaorong. Subsequently, there was a battle where Li Shaorong was surrounded by enemy soldiers (presumably soldiers of Jin's archrival Later Liang), when Gao Xingzhou fought into the encirclement and rescued Li Shaorong. Impressed, Li Cunxu also wanted Gao to serve under him, but did not feel that he could make another request to Li Siyuan. Instead, he secretly sent messengers to Gao, trying to entice him with higher offices. Gao declined, stating:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269.  Service during Later Tang  In spring 923, Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong). At that time, the Later Tang and Later Liang forces were stalemated on the Yellow River. Li Siyuan suggested a surprise attack on Later Liang's Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), south of the Yellow River. Emperor Zhuangzong agreed, and in the subsequent surprise attack on Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture (), Gao Xingzhou served under Li Siyuan in capturing the city. (During the surprise attack on Yun, Li Siyuan's army was initially hindered by pouring rain, but Gao pointed out that this would make the defenders of Yun even less cautious about a potential attack, and encouraged the rest of the army to continue on.) Emperor Zhuangzong was thus able to use Yun as the base for another surprise operation later in 923, capturing Later Liang's capital Daliang and destroying Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. After destroying Later Liang, Emperor Zhuangzong made Gao the prefect of Duan Prefecture (Á´ØÂ∑û, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong) (i.e., an honorary position, as Duan was then the territory of Southern Han), and later the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (Áµ≥Â∑û, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). Gao was still serving under Li Siyuan in 926, when the Later Tang realm was overrun with mutinies in light of Emperor Zhuangzong's recent killing of major generals Guo Chongtao and Zhu Youqian without justification. When Li Siyuan was sent to combat mutineers at Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei), according to traditional accounts, his own soldiers mutinied and forced him to join the Yedu mutineers. Subsequently, he tried to send a number of officers, including Gao, to nearby Li Shaorong, to try to get Li Shaorong to join him in jointly acting against the mutineers, but Li Shaorong, suspecting Li Siyuan's intentions, did not respond, and subsequently reported to Emperor Zhuangzong that Li Siyuan had joined the mutiny. Unable to show himself to be still faithful to Emperor Zhuangzong, Li Siyuan headed south toward the capital Luoyang,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. where Emperor Zhuangzong was then killed in a mutiny before Li Siyuan reached there. When Li Siyuan arrived, he declared himself regent, and later emperor (as Emperor Mingzong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Emperor Mingzong was said to respect Gao's abilities, and in 928, when Wang Du the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), whose domain had been semi- independent from the Later Tang imperial government, openly broke with the Later Tang,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Gao served under the general Wang Yanqiu in quelling Wang Du's rebellion and had much accomplishment during the campaign. After the campaign against Wang Du, he was made the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Ying Prefecture (ÊΩÅÂ∑û, in modern Fuyang, Anhui). Early in Emperor Mingzong's Changxing era (930‚Äì933), as at that time Later Tang's northern borders were often attacked by the Khitan Empire, Gao was made the military governor of Zhenwu (ÊåØÊ≠¶, headquartered in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi) to help defend the border. The next year, as Emperor Mingzong was preparing for an operation against the de facto independent Dingnan Circuit's military governor Li Yichao (), Gao was made the military governor of Zhangwu Circuit (ÂΩ∞Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) to prepare for the operation.As the actual operations against Li Yichao was in 933, this suggests that Gao's commission was in 933 or slightly earlier. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. Li Congke later became emperor after Emperor Mingzong's death, and early in his Qingtai era (934‚Äì937), Gao was made the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). When, in 936, Li Congke's brother-in-law (Emperor Mingzong's son-in-law) Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong rebelled against Li Congke and solicited aid from Khitan's Emperor Taizong, Li Congke commissioned the general Zhang Jingda as the commander of the overall operations against Shi and had Gao serve under Zhang. Zhang's army quickly put Hedong's capital Taiyuan under siege, but was subsequently crushed by the Liao emperor's army and forced to retreat to Jin'an Fortress (ÊôâÂÆâÂØ®, near Taiyuan) and then was surrounded there by the joint Liao/Hedong army, unable to fight its way out, but Zhang refused to surrender. Another general serving under Zhang, Yang Guangyuan, wanted to assassinate Zhang and surrender to the Liao/Hedong army. Gao, knowing this, often followed Zhang around the camp to protect him, but Zhang, not knowing this, in fact became suspicious of Gao's intentions, such that Gao did not dare to continue this. Eventually, Yang was able to assassinate Zhang and then surrender the Later Tang army to the Liao/Hedong army. (As, during the Jin'an siege, the Khitan emperor had created Shi the emperor of a new Later Jin (as its Emperor Gaozu), the surrendered Later Tang army was then folded into the Hedong army to become the Later Jin army.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280.  Service during Later Jin  The joint Liao/Later Jin forces (now enlarged with the remnants of the Later Tang army at Jin'an) then engaged another Later Tang army sent to combat it, commanded by Zhao Dejun the military governor of Lulong, at Tuanbo Valley (ÂúòÊüèË∞∑, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), crushing it. Zhao Dejun and his son Zhao Yanshou fled to and tried to defend Zhaoyi's capital Lu Prefecture (). The Later Jin emperor sent Gao Xingzhou back to Zhaoyi, and when he reached Lu, he persuaded Zhao Dejun and Zhao Yanshou to surrender. With the Zhaos out of the way, nothing was left to block the Liao/Later Jin forces from advancing on the Later Tang capital Luoyang, and so, as Emperor Gaozu did so (Liao's Emperor Taizong opined that if he advanced on Luoyang with Khitan troops, the people would panic, and therefore chose not to), Li Congke and his family committed suicide, ending Later Tang. Emperor Gaozu entered Luoyang and took over the rest of the Later Tang realm. He allowed Gao to return to his post at Zhaoyi, and bestowed on Gao the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). In 937, Fan Yanguang the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered at Yedu) rebelled against Emperor Gaozu. Initially, Emperor Gaozu ordered Gao to attack Yedu from the west, but then decided to attack Fan himself, instead making Gao the defender of Luoyang and the mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region) to defend it in Emperor Gaozu's absence. Gao wanted to carry out a major construction project to remodel the palaces at Luoyang, but at the urging of the official Xue Rong (), Emperor Gaozu did not approve the project. After Fan surrendered later in the year, Emperor Gaozu initially made Yang Guangyuan the military governor of Tianxiong, but later, fearing that Tianxiong was too powerful of a military command and Yang was difficult to control, decided to divide Tianxiong ‚Äî carving out Yedu itself out as Guangjin Municipality () and making Gao its defender and mayor, while dividing the rest of Tianxiong into two circuits.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. In 941, as Emperor Gaozu went to Yedu, in anticipation of a rebellion by An Chongrong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), he apparently moved Gao back to Luoyang ‚Äî for Gao was referred to as the defender of Luoyang when, shortly afterwards, An Congjin the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) rebelled. Emperor Gaozu's nephew Shi Chonggui the Prince of Zheng, whom Emperor Gaozu left in charge of then-capital Kaifeng (i.e., Daliang), commissioned Gao to head the army to be sent against An Congjin. The monitor of Gao's army, Zhang Cong'en (), quickly engaged An Congjin's army, surprising it and defeating it, forcing An Congjin to flee back to Shannan East's capital Xiang Prefecture (). Gao put it under siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. In fall 942, Xiang Prefecture fell, and An Congjin committed suicide with his family.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. A few months earlier, Emperor Gaozu had died and was succeeded by Shi Chonggui as emperor. Shi Chonggui moved Gao to Guide Circuit (Ê≠∏Âæ∑, headquartered in modern Shangqiu, Henan), and gave him the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). Upon taking the throne, Shi Chonggui took a hardline position in relations with Khitan ‚Äî refusing to subjugate Later Jin to Khitan, like Emperor Gaozu did. As a result, war began between the two states. In 944, during a major Khitan incursion (which, for some time, captured and held Yedu) to aid Yang (who had rebelled at Tianping Circuit), Gao was put in titular charge of the overall operations, but it was said that Shi Chonggui's trusted general Jing Yanguang, the commander of the imperial guards, was actually the one giving orders, causing the other generals to be displeased. During one of the battles, Khitan forces had Gao, Fu Yanqing, and Shi Gongba () under siege at Qicheng (ÊàöÂüé, in modern Puyang, Henan). The city almost fell, and Jing did not come to its aid, but when three generals' request for emergency assistance reached Shi Chonggui, Shi Chonggui himself went to the city's rescue and lifted the siege. Shortly after this battle, Shi Chonggui relieved Jing of his post as the commanding general of the imperial guards, putting Gao in that position instead.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. In 946, Shi Chonggui launched a major attack against Khitan, putting his uncle (husband of Emperor Gaozu's sister the Princess Song), Du Wei, in command of the army. Du, however, was not fully intending to attack Khitan. He advanced only half-heartedly, and his army was shortly thereafter trapped by the Khitan army under Emperor Taizong at Zhongdu Bridge (‰∏≠Â∫¶Ê©ã, in modern Baoding, Hebei). Shi Chonggui commissioned Gao to head a rescue force, with Fu serving as his deputy, but it appeared that before the army could be launched, Du surrendered to the Khitan emperor and subsequently served as the guide for the Khitan army south. Emperor Taizong shortly after approached Kaifeng. Shi Chonggui tried to commit suicide, but was stopped by his general Xue Chao (). Subsequently, he surrendered to the Khitan, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285.  Between Later Jin's destruction and Later Han's firm establishment  After Shi Chonggui's surrender, both Gao Xingzhou and Fu Yanqing also went to the Khitan emperor's headquarters to surrender as well. Emperor Taizong changed the name of the Khitan state to Liao and declared himself the emperor of China as well as Khitan. Distrusting the Later Jin-commissioned military governors who came to Kaifeng to submit to him, he initially kept them at Kaifeng and did not send them back to their circuits. Further, he allowed the Khitan soldiers to pillage the circuits around Kaifeng, causing the people of the former Later Jin realm to rise in agrarian rebellions against Liao. As an attempt to quell these rebellions, he began to send military governors back to their circuits, but had Khitan soldiers escort them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Gao was apparently allowed to return to Guide during this wave of redeployments. Eventually, apparently sick of the rebellions and the heat, in summer 947, Emperor Taizong decided to head back to Khitan proper, leaving his brother-in-law Xiao Han in command at Kaifeng as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (). On the way back to Khitan proper, Emperor Taizong died near Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, Chengde's capital). By this time, the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan the military governor of Hedong had declared himself the emperor of a new Later Han, as its Emperor Gaozu. Further, the Liao imperial succession question was unsettled ‚Äî as Zhao Yanshou tried to take over the southern realm (i.e., the parts of Later Jin that Liao still controlled) but was then arrested by Emperor Taizong's nephew Yel√º Ruan the Prince of Yongkang (who then claimed the throne as Emperor Shizong), but whose succession was then still opposed by Emperor Taizong's powerful mother (Emperor Shizong's grandmother) Empress Dowager Shul√º Ping. With more of the realm rising against Liao control, Xiao decided to extract himself from Kaifeng. He forced Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang's youngest son Li Congyi to accept the title of emperor, and then fled from Kaifeng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. Kaifeng was then virtually defenseless, as Xiao only left 1,000 soldiers from Lulong to serve as Li Congyi's guards. Li Congyi's adoptive mother (Emperor Mingzong's concubine) Consort Dowager Wang knew that the situation was untenable, but initially unsure what to do. She initially sent messengers to summon Gao from Guide and Wu Xingde () from Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), hoping that they would support Li Congyi, but neither responded. (Gao did so by claiming an illness, and privately stated, \\"A fallen dynasty cannot be assisted, particularly when it is a child's game.\\") (Without support from Gao or Wu, Consort Dowager Wang decided to submit to the Later Han emperor. She had Li Congyi take the lesser title of Prince of Liang and sent emissaries to Emperor Gaozu, welcoming him to Kaifeng ‚Äî but upon his arrival at Kaifeng, he had her and Li Congyi executed anyway.)  Service during Later Han  After Emperor Gaozu entered Kaifeng, Gao Xingzhou went to Kaifeng to pay homage to him. Most former Later Jin generals formally submitted to Emperor Gaozu, including Du Chongwei (i.e., Du Wei, who by this point had restored his name to Du Chongwei, which had been changed to Du Wei to serve naming taboo for Shi Chonggui), who was then the military governor of Tianxiong. Du, in order to test Emperor Gaozu's attitude toward him, also offered to be moved to another circuit. Emperor Gaozu accepted his invitation and moved him to Guide and Gao to Tianxiong. However, as Du was only using the offer to move to test Emperor Gaozu, he rebelled against Later Han as soon as he received news of the movement. Emperor Gaozu commissioned Gao as the commander of the army against Du and made Murong Yanchao (Emperor Gaozu's half-brother) the military governor of Zhenning Circuit (ÈéÆÂØß, headquartered in modern Puyang) to be Gao's deputy. They headed to Yedu, but soon had major disagreements as to strategy ‚Äî Gao wanted to siege the city patiently, while Murong wanted to attack it aggressively, with Murong claiming that Gao's strategy was motivated by the fact that Gao's daughter married Du's son. With Gao and Murong having disagreement, Emperor Gaozu decided to personally head to Yedu to oversee the campaign. When he arrived there, Gao continued to advocate the slow siege strategy, wanting to wear out the city's food supply and pointing out that the city was well-defended, so an aggressive attack would cause many casualties. With Murong continuing to accuse him, he also went to Emperor Gaozu's chief assistants Su Fengji and Yang Bin to plead his case ‚Äî stuffing feces and dirt into his mouth as he was doing so, to analogize it to the kind of humiliation that he suffered from Murong. Emperor Gaozu believed Gao, went to his tent to thank him, and rebuked Murong. Du agreed to surrender in winter 947, but Gao initially declined the Tianxiong command, as it neighbored Zhenning and he did not want further dealing with Murong. In response, Emperor Gaozu moved Murong to Tianping. He also created Gao the Prince of Linqing. In 950, by which time Emperor Gaozu had been succeeded by his son Emperor Yin (Emperor Gaozu's having died in 948), Emperor Yin moved Gao to Tianping.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. Emperor Yin also created him the Prince of Ye, and then changed the title to Prince of Qi upon the Tianping commission. Emperor Yin, meanwhile, was displeased that much of the power, several years after Emperor Gaozu's death, was still in the hands of several generals/officials that Emperor Gaozu designated to assist him ‚Äî Yang, Guo Wei, Shi Hongzhao, and Wang Zhang, with Yang overseeing general governance, Guo overseeing military campaigns, Shi overseeing the imperial guards, and Wang overseeing the financial matters. Later in 950, Emperor Yin decided to act against them; he ambushed Yang, Shi, and Wang, killing them, while sending secret orders to Yedu (where Guo was then stationed) to kill Guo and Guo's army monitor Wang Jun (which were intercepted by Guo and not carried out) while having Guo's and Wang Jun's families, which remained at Kaifeng, slaughtered. He summoned a number of military governors, including Gao, to Kaifeng, to help defend against any disturbances, but there were no records of Gao trying to intervene on either the emperor's side or Guo's side when Guo subsequently marched on Kaifeng, defeated the imperial troops, and took over the imperial government. (Guo initially declared that he was going to have Emperor Gaozu's nephew Liu Yun the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) made emperor, but with the soldiers supporting him to be emperor instead, soon declared himself emperor of a new Later Zhou as its Emperor Taizu.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.  Service during Later Zhou  The new Later Zhou emperor formally took the throne in spring 951, and most Later Han military governors formally submitted to him as emperor, including Gao Xingzhou and Murong Yanchao. (The main exception was Liu Chong the military governor of Hedong, the younger brother of Later Han's Emperor Gaozu (and father to Liu Yun, who was executed by Later Zhou), who declared himself the new emperor of Later Han, but whose state was subsequently known historically as Northern Han and not traditionally considered part of Later Han's history.) Murong, however, was apprehensive under Emperor Taizu due to his status as Emperor Gaozu's half-brother, so he gathered soldiers and food, considering a rebellion, and was in communications with Northern Han, Liao, and Southern Tang. To try to assuage concerns that Emperor Taizu may have about him, he repeatedly sent his attendant Zheng Lin () to Kaifeng to claim loyalty and to also spy on the imperial court, while submitting letters that he claimed were written by Gao in which the writer defamed the Later Zhou imperial government and offered an alliance with Murong. Emperor Taizu, however, did not believe that Gao had written these letters, and sent the letters to Gao. Gao responded by submitting a petition thanking the new emperor. Murong subsequently rebelled against Later Zhou, but his rebellion was put down by summer 952. Gao died in fall 952. He was remembered as being brave and righteous, having great accomplishments but not arrogant, willing to personally face enemies in battle, and approachable with his staff members. He was given posthumous honors, including the title of Prince of Qin.

History In the January 1262 Battle of Kalgen during the Great Prussian Uprising, a Sambian army ambushed the crusading forces of William IV, Count of J√ºlich, and Engelbert I, Count of the Mark, near Kalgen.Gause I, p. 23 The German crusaders were able to defeat the Sambians with the assistance of K√∂nigsberg Castle's garrison of Teutonic Knights.

The villages was documented as Sclunien in 1326, Calyen in 1419, Kalgyn in 1491, and Gallien in 1522.Gerullis, pp. 54 and 162 Its name was of Old Prussian origin. On 9 April 1522 Grand Master Albert granted Kalgen to Paul Militisch of Kneiphof, who had served as secretary to the grand master since 1514. The estate of Kalgen later belonged to the Sacksen family.Albinus, p. 146 The chaussee from K√∂nigsberg to Kalgen began in 1816 and became part of the road toward Berlin.

Incumbent mayor Dick Murphy stood for reelection for a second term. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though some candidates do receive funding and support from various political parties. The non-partisan primary was held Tuesday, June 3, 2004. Murphy and county supervisor Ron Roberts received the most votes and advanced to the November special general election. After the primary San Diego City Council member Donna Frye entered the race as a write-in candidate for the November general election. Murphy was certified as winner with a narrow plurality of the votes in the general election over runner-up Frye. This result was subject to a recount and litigation before ultimately being upheld by the courts in February 2005. Candidates Declared *Dick Murphy, incumbent mayor of San Diego (Voter registration: Republican) *Ron Roberts, San Diego County supervisor and mayoral candidate in 1992 and 2000 (Voter registration: Republican) *Peter Q. Davis, banker (Voter registration: Republican) *Jim Bell, environmental designer (Party preference: Democratic) Write-in *Donna Frye, city council member (Voter registration: Democratic) Campaign In the March primary Dick Murphy received the most votes but not a majority, denying him the outright majority needed for an outright victory. This was the first time in twenty years that an incumbent mayor was forced to face a runoff election. San Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts received the second most votes and advanced to the general election alongside Murphy. Roberts had also been the runner-up in the 2000 mayoral election against Murphy. After the primary elections, San Diego City Council member Donna Frye announced that she would run as a write-in candidate. Frye ran a maverick campaign against Murphy and Roberts, who were both considered establishment candidates by the media. Frye was the only member of the city council to vote against the underfunding of San Diego's pension liabilities that led to the San Diego pension scandal. As mayor, Murphy had voted in favor of the underfunding. Recount and litigation In the general election, Dick Murphy was certified as winner of a plurality of votes by a margin of 2,108 votes over runner-up Frye. However, news outlets uncovered 5,547 ballots that were not counted on which voters had written in Frye's name but not filled in the adjacent oval. If these votes had been counted, Frye would have been elected mayor instead of Murphy. Members of the media requested a recount indirectly on Frye's behalf, leading to allegations of bias from Murphy's lawyers. Attorney Fred Woocher filed a lawsuit on behalf of three voters contesting Murphy's victory due to the 5,000 uncounted ballots. On February 2, 2005, Judge Michael Brenner ruled that the unfilled ovals did not count as votes under California state law, ending the post-election litigation battle. Aftermath In April 2005, only two months after the results of the election were officially upheld by the courts, Murphy announced that he would be resigning as mayor. In the face of a deepening pension scandal that he was personally involved in, Murphy stated that San Diego needed a mayor with the support of the majority of residents and a clear mandate to lead the city out of its crisis. The city held a special election to fill the vacancy at mayor. In response to Donna Frye's nearly successful write-in candidacy, the San Diego City Council amended the municipal code so that write-in candidates could not run in general elections or run-off elections. Write-ins are still permitted in primary elections and recall elections.

The violence led to the deaths of 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots. Approximately 25,000 Turkish Cypriots from 104 villages, amounting to a quarter of the Turkish Cypriot population, fled their villages and were displaced into enclaves. Thousands of Turkish Cypriot houses left behind were ransacked or completely destroyed. Around 1,200 Armenian Cypriots and 500 Greek Cypriots were also displaced. The violence precipitated the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the Republic of Cyprus. The term Bloody Christmas is not used in official Greek Cypriot and Greek historiography, which contends that the outbreak of violence was a result of a Turkish Cypriot rebellion (Tourkantarsia) against the lawful government of the Republic of Cyprus.  Background  The Republic of Cyprus was established as a bi-communal unitary state in 1960. Neither of the two communities were happy with this situation as Greek Cypriots thought it was their right to unite Cyprus with Greece (enosis) while Turkish Cypriots were striving for partition (taksim). After two relatively peaceful years, in November 1963 tensions skyrocketed when President and Arch-bishop Makarios III proposed 13 constitutional changes which were met with fury by Turkish Cypriots.  Events   21 December: eruption  The incident that sparked the events of Bloody Christmas occurred during the early hours of 21 December 1963. Greek Cypriot police operating within the old Venetian walls of Nicosia demanded to see the identification papers of some Turkish Cypriots who were returning home in a taxi from an evening out. When the police officers attempted to search the women in the car, the driver objected and an argument ensued. Soon a crowd gathered and shots were fired. By dawn, two Turkish Cypriots had been killed and eight others, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, had been wounded.  21 December to 23 December  After the shooting, crowds of Turkish Cypriots gathered in the northern part of Nicosia, often led by the Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT). On 22 December, the funerals of the two Turkish Cypriots killed were held without incident. However, shooting broke out on the evening of 22 December. Cars full of armed Greek Cypriots roamed through the streets of Nicosia and fired indiscriminately, and Turkish Cypriots fired at patrolling police cars. Turkish Cypriot snipers fired from minarets and the roof of the Saray Hotel on Saray√∂n√º Square. Some shooting spread to the suburbs and to Larnaca. The Greek Cypriot administration cut off telephone and telegraph lines to Turkish Cypriot quarters of the city of Nicosia and the police took control of the Nicosia International Airport. Greek paramilitary groups led by Nikos Sampson and Vassos Lyssarides were activated. On 23 December, a ceasefire was agreed upon by Makarios III and Turkish Cypriot leadership. However, fighting continued and intensified in Nicosia and Larnaca. Machine guns were fired from mosques in Turkish-inhabited areas. Later on 23 December, Greek Cypriot irregulars headed by Sampson committed the massacre of Omorphita: they attacked the suburb, killing Turkish Cypriots, including women and children, \\"apparently indiscriminately\\". The Turkish Cypriot residents of the quarter were expelled from their homes.  Later events  A number of Turkish Cypriot mosques, shrines and other places of worship were desecrated. Greek Cypriot irregulars attacked Turkish Cypriots in the mixed villages of Mathiatis on 23 December and Ayios Vasilios on 24 December. The entire Turkish Cypriot population of Mathiatis, 208 people, fled to nearby Turkish Cypriot villages. Harry Scott Gibbons, a reporter in Cyprus at the time, reported the murder of 21 Turkish Cypriot patients from the Nicosia General Hospital on Christmas Eve. This is taken as a fact in the Turkish Cypriot narrative, but is disputed in the Greek Cypriot narrative. An investigation of the incident by a \\"highly reliable\\" Greek Cypriot source found that three Turkish Cypriots died, of which one died of a heart attack and the other two were shot by a \\"lone psychopath\\". A joint call for calm was issued on 24 December by the governments of Turkey, Greece and the United Kingdom. As Cyprus was falling into havoc, Greece, Turkey and Britain, with Makarios's approval, created a Joint Truce Force under the command of General Peter Young, whose goal was to maintain, or rather re-establish, law, order and peace in Cyprus. By 31 December, 49 Turkish Cypriots and 20 Greek Cypriots were killed and 30 and 4, Turkish and Greek Cypriots respectively, were missing. Moreover, some Turkish Cypriots who had fled their homes to avoid the deadly Greek Cypriot paramilitary gangs and found shelter in Turkish only villages of the north side of Cyprusone of the first steps towards partition. A conference held in London in January among the protagonists of the events, failed because of the maximalist positions of the leadership of Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The Republic of Cyprus states that between 21 December 1963 and 10 August 1964, 191 Turkish Cypriots were killed and 173 went missing, presumed killed, while Greek Cypriots suffered 133 killed and 41 missing, presumed killed. Overall, 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots were killed in the 1963‚Äì64 conflict. Around 25,000 Turkish Cypriots from 104 different villages abandoned their homes. These consisted of 72 mixed and 24 Turkish Cypriot villages that were completely evacuated and 8 mixed villages that were partially evacuated. The displacement amounted to a quarter of the Turkish Cypriot population. Approximately 1,200 Armenian Cypriots and 500 Greek Cypriots were also displaced. Most of the property abandoned by Turkish Cypriots was ransacked, damaged, burned or destroyed by Greek Cypriots. A 1964 United Nations report that used aerial photographs determined that at least 977 Turkish Cypriot homes had been destroyed and that 2,000 Turkish Cypriot homes had suffered severe damage and ransacking. The report by the UN Secretary General on 10 September 1964 gives the number of destroyed houses as 527 and the number of looted houses as 2,000. This included 50 totally destroyed and 240 partially destroyed houses in Omorphita and the surrounding suburbs, and 38 totally and 122 partially destroyed houses and shops in the town of Paphos. = Mass grave of Agios Vasilios = A mass grave was exhumed at Ayios Vasilios on 12 January 1964 in the presence of foreign reporters, officers of the British Army and, officials from the International Red Cross. The bodies of 21 Turkish Cypriots were found in this grave. It was presumed that they had been killed in or near Ayios Vasilios on 24 December 1963. It was verified by the observers that a number of the victims appeared to have been tortured, and to have been shot after their hands and feet were tied.The incident at Ayios Vasilios is described in the Special News Bulletin, issues 6, 19, 20, 21, 25 and 38. Secondary sources include H.S. Gibbons, 1969, pp. 114‚Äì117, 137‚Äì140; and K.D. Purcell, 1969, p. 327. An investigating committee led by independent British investigators then linked the incident to an ostensible disappearance of Turkish Cypriot patients in the Nicosia General Hospital, but it was not determined until decades later that many of the bodies had been murdered elsewhere, stored in the hospital for a while and then buried in Ayios Vasilios. However, several of the village's residents were also amongst those killed by Greek Cypriots. The exhumed bodies were interred by the Turkish Cypriot authorities to the yard of the Mevlevi Tekke in Nicosia. The bodies were exhumed in the 2010s by the Missing Persons Committee, the eight villagers of Ayios Vasilios identified and buried individually.  Commemoration  It is generally accepted on both sides of the island that the event is clearly not an occasion for celebration, less importantly by association with the issue of inter-communal violence and what that led to, and more so by its own string of tragic events. It is also often considered to contribute to reflections that the island of Cyprus is still divided more than 50 years later, which is a constant reminder to both sides that there has hardly been any joint communal achievement since, and is therefore seen by many as a time for reflection and trying to find a solution for future generations. Turkish Cypriots annually, and officially, commemorate 1963 as ‚ÄòKanlƒ± Noel‚Äô (Bloody Christmas) on 21 December, as a collective tragedy, for which Greek Cypriots have no official commemoration. The anniversary is commemorated by Turkish Cypriots as the 'week of remembrance' and the 'martyrs' struggle of 1963‚Äì1974', and follows the TRNC's Independence Day, which is on 15 November and is marked by protests in the south. There are those on both sides that view these commemorations or lack thereof as issues for contention during Cyprus peace talks. It is often the case that the few public gestures made by Turkish and Greek Cypriot officials that signal possible reunification are often contradicted by these elements which have the effect of reinforcing the conflict mentality.  Greek Cypriot official view  Anthropologist Olga Demetriou has described the Greek Cypriot official discourse regarding the events of Bloody Christmas as one that \\"in a sense, parallels denialist strategies that, for example and albeit in cruder form, draw on the battle of Van in 1915 to present Armenians as aggressors against Turks and deny the genocide.\\" According to Demetriou, this is still reflected in the Greek Cypriot history textbooks today, and has the effect of presenting the Greek Cypriots as the victims of Turkish Cypriot aggression, although the majority of the victims were Turkish Cypriot. According to Yannis Papadakis, Greek Cypriot schoolbooks describe the 1960s as \\"a period of aggression by the 'Turks' (Turkey and Turkish Cypriots) against the 'Greeks'\\", though the Turkish Cypriots suffered heavier losses in the conflict. This has been used by the Republic of Cyprus to legitimise human rights violations against Turkish Cypriots, the suspension of their political rights, and, until 2003, the exclusion of Turkish Cypriots from the framing of the missing people by the Republic of Cyprus. In 2004, Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos said in an interview that no Turkish Cypriots were killed between 1963 and 1974. Reaction to this claim appeared in the Greek and Turkish Cypriot media, with some Greek Cypriot media calling Papadopoulos's claim a blatant lie. Demetriou further contends that the use of the term \\"Turkish mutiny\\" (Tourkantarsia) to describe the events of 1963‚Äì64 contributes to the Greek Cypriot narrative that the Cyprus problem started in 1974, under which the Greek Cypriot and Armenian Cypriot people displaced in 1963‚Äì64 are not classified as \\"refugees\\" but as \\"those struck by the Turks\\" (Tourkoplihtoi).

The court ruled that s. 13 does not protect an accused who chooses to testify at a retrial from having his or her previously volunteered testimony used against him or her.Matthias, Don, Criminal Law Developments in Leading Appellate Courts, p. 119 The court further held that no distinction should be drawn between the use of such evidence to incriminate the accused directly or to impeach his or her credibility, but it subsequently partially restored this distinction in R. v. Nedelcu, 2012 SCC 59.  Background  David Henry and Barry Riley had previously been convicted of the first degree murder of Timothy Langmead, who was tied to a chair and had duct tape wound around his mouth in relation to a dispute over a drug-related debt. Henry and Riley's murder convictions were overturned by the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the matter sent back for re-trial. Henry and Riley had testified in their own defence at the first trial and did so again at the second, but told a different story in the second trial. They were convicted again after the Crown cross-examined them on the inconsistent statements from the first trial. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld their conviction, rejecting their argument that s. 13 ought to have prevented their previously given testimony from being revealed to the jury despite that they had voluntarily testified in their own defence on both occasions. Hall J.A. dissented, finding that the testimony on which the Crown had cross-examined the appellants was directly incriminating, and that previous Supreme Court decisions limited the use of such testimony to impeaching the accused's credibility. Henry and Riley appealed to the Supreme Court as of right as a result of the decision being split. The only live issue at the Supreme Court was the scope of R. v. No√´l and R. v. Allen, specifically, whether s. 13 was available to an accused who chose to testify at his or her retrial.  Court's reasons  Writing for the court, Binnie J. found that the purpose of s. 13 was to \\"protect individuals from being indirectly compelled to incriminate themselves\\" (para 22). In tandem with section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, it accomplished this by establishing a quid pro quo system, in which witnesses can be compelled to testify on potentially incriminating matters in return for the State's promise that such compelled evidence cannot be used against them. By preventing the subsequent use of this testimony, such a system encourages the witness to provide full and frank testimony. Based on this rationale, the court overruled its earlier decision in R. v. Mannion, holding that s. 13 was only available to an accused who had testified compulsorily in the earlier proceeding, whether a retrial of the same matter or a different trial. It thus drew a distinction between retrial situations where the accused had previously testified voluntarily (and should not be entitled to full immunity) and instances where the accused had been compelled to testify as a non-accused witness in a different trial (and should thus receive full immunity). Binnie J. further wrote that drawing a distinction between the use of previously given testimony to impeach the accused's credibility or to incriminate him or her was unworkable in practice. On that basis, he concluded that s. 13 applies to any use of evidence given under compulsion, including for the ostensible purpose of challenging the accused's credibility. As a result of its holding on the availability of s. 13 to an accused testifying on retrial, the court found that Henry and Riley's previous testimony had not been improperly introduced at the second trial, dismissing the appeals and letting their convictions stand.  Aftermath  The status of court's decision not to distinguish between evidence used to incriminate or impeach is unclear following R. v. Nedelcu, 2012 SCC 59, where a majority of the Supreme Court found that s. 13 was not engaged when an accused's testimony obtained under compulsion in a related civil proceeding was used to convict him in the criminal trial by attacking his credibility.Sara Hanson, \\"R v Nedelcu: The Right Against Self-Incrimination and the Return to the Unworkable Distinction\\", 24 Nov 2012 Writing for the dissent, LeBel J. noted that the approach adopted by the majority overruled or at least altered Henry on that point.

Aicardi demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years and he was soon noticed by his teachers for a portrait of Giuseppe Mazzini that he drew in chalk on the classroom's blackboard (1901). It became evident to Aicardi that his ideal, his great passion, was \\"to paint\\" and with his mother's full support he enrolled at the \\"Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti\\" in Genoa. He studied with different professors at the Accademia, and promoted at the third stage. Prof. Quinzio instills in his young scholar the taste for a more personalised style of painting. While studying at the Accademia, he attended the studio of Giuseppe Pennasilico, a most famous Neapolitan painter of the time, who appreciated and encouraged his pupil to paint \\"en plein air.\\" In 1906 Aicardi, aged 15, painted his first \\"fresco\\" of Santa Teresa (his sister Ernesta was his model), which still can be seen in the dome of \\"San Biagio Basilica\\" in his native Finalborgo (Savona). Before his 20th Birthday (1911) Aicardi won, on merit, first the \\"Pensione Triennale\\" a Government sponsored three year bursary at the \\"Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti\\" of Genoa, followed by the \\"Pensionato Quinquennale of Rome\\" a five-year bursary enabling him to study and paint in Florence and Rome. Early adulthood This was a pivotal period in his development in Rome and Florence where he studied the old masters and started forming important friendships with established painters, sculptors, and writers, during this period he produced many excellent drawings and paintings in the \\"Post Impressionists\\" style; completing his refinement in London, Paris and Madrid. He was commissioned to paint frescos in palaces and churches, some of the work was to produce new frescos, but many were to restore existing frescos by old masters from fourteenth to the eighteenth century that had been damaged in the First World War or by time. He went on to paint nudes, still life, marine, landscapes, portraits, and posters for advertising. At the same time Aicardi initiated his activity as an exhibitor; he held several exhibitions that took place in Italy and abroad. Many of the commissions for frescos were awarded to Aicardi in Assisi (Umbria) and Urbino (Marche) by Piero Torriti, the superintendent to all art galleries for the Marche's region of Italy and a member of the Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti. Adulthood In 1929 Giorgio Matteo Aicardi married Carmela Veruda, (at first one of his students and then his model) their happy union produced three children: Francesco, Ada and Giovanna, throughout his life Aicardi used his family for models. In 1938 Aicardi was elected, on merit, \\"professore\\" to the \\"Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti\\" (painters class) followed by the Academy \\"Publio Virgilio Marone\\" in Bari and the \\"Latinanti Escoleangae\\" in Rome. In 1950 Aicardi took part in the \\"Lavoro umano\\" exhibition in the former \\"Royal Palace\\" in Genoa and won the \\"Premio della Provincia\\" with his painting \\"Il lavoro nell'infanzia\\" which was bought by the then first Italian Prime Minister, Hon. De Nicola for the Italian Government. At the \\"Pro-Civitate Museum\\" in Assisi in the \\"Iconografia Cristiana\\" collections there is a photographic documentation of some of Aicardi's religious art work comprising: paintings, frescos and even religious banners. Aicardi loved music, he trained and could play violin, guitar and piano. His other interests were boxing, \\"bocce\\" (the Italian version of \\"boules\\") to a good amateur level, he loved swimming and diving which he practiced to a ripe old age. Aicardi also has the merit of having translated Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\" into the Genoise dialect. In later years Aicardi spent a considerable amount of time writing his memoirs. Aicardi painted incessantly throughout his life right up to his death, among his Art, on 30 December 1984 in Genoa. Posthumous notes In 1986 a posthumous exhibition of Aicardi's paintings was held in his native Finalborgo at the \\"Chiostri di Santa Caterina\\" sponsored by Cassa di Risparmio di Savona. Among the various private art collectors in Genoa, Turin, Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Monte Carlo, etc. Mitchell Wolfson Jr. purchased one outstanding portrait by G.M. Aicardi: \\"Autoritratto del pittore con la sua famiglia\\" 1939, oil on canvas, for The Mitchell Wolfson Jr. Foundation Miami (Florida) and the \\"Wolfsoniana Fondazione Regionale Cristoforo Colombo\\" ‚Äì Genoa (Italy). Mitchell Wolfson Jr. acquired many of Aicardi's artwork and showed them in numerous exhibitions: 1996 \\"Aspetti dell'arte italiana tra le due guerre\\" at Palazzo Ducale ‚Äì Genoa; 1999/2000 \\"La visione del prisma\\" at Palazzo Pilotta ‚Äì Parma; 2001 \\"Parole e immagini futuriste\\" at New York University, NY, at Museo Italo Americano ‚Äì San Francisco and Palazzo Ducale ‚Äì Genoa; 2002 \\"Under Mussolini\\" Decorative and Propaganda Arts of the Twenties and Thirties at the \\"Estorick Collection\\" ‚Äì London reinforcing the historical links that binds Liguria and Great Britain and revealed to the British public the richness of the region's cultural patrimony. Nowadays Aicardi's art can be found in museums, palaces, churches and private collections all over the world.

The purchase of the Spirits by the NBA including Schupak's resulting ownership interest was called the best sports deal of the century by Sports Illustrated.Donald Schupak page at SGI Cambium Enterprising brothers converted NBA buyout of ABA team into multimillion- dollar windfall, Eddie Pells, Associated Press, Saturday, May 27, 2006Pluto, Terry, Loose Balls: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association (Simon & Schuster, 1990), , pp.431-433 He has served as chairman, chief executive officer, chief operating officer and strategy consultant for a number of public and private companies, including Horn & Hardart and IBM. Schupak is a founder and senior managing member of SGI MB LLC, a New York City-based merchant bank and registered broker dealer.  The Spirits of St. Louis  In June 1976 the American Basketball Association owners agreed, in return for the Spirits of St. Louis ceasing operations, to pay the St. Louis owners (primarily Ozzie and Daniel Silna) $2.2 million in cash up front in addition to a 1/7 share of the four remaining teams' television revenues in perpetuity.Dan Pattison article on the ABA's final season Pluto, Terry, Loose Balls: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association (Simon & Schuster, 1990), , pp.428-433 Those teams, formerly of the ABA, are the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs. As the NBA's popularity exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, the league's television rights were sold to CBS and then NBC, and additional deals were struck with the TNT and TBS cable networks; league television revenue soared into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Over the past 25 years, the Silnas have collected approximately $300 million from the NBA, despite the fact that the Spirits never played an NBA game. The Silnas continue to receive checks from the NBA on a yearly basis, representing a 4/7 share of the television money that would normally go to any NBA franchise, or roughly two percent of the entire league's TV money.Pluto, Terry, Loose Balls: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association (Simon & Schuster, 1990), , p.433 Thanks to their deal during the ABA-NBA merger the Silnas made millions through 1980s and at least $4.4 million per year through 1990s. From 1999 through 2002 the deal netted the Spirits' owners at least $12.53 million per year; from 2003-2006 their take was at least $15.6 million per year. The two Silna brothers each get 45% of that television revenue per year and Schupak receives 10%. They credit their terrific deal to planning they had done ahead of the merger for the Virginia Squires owners; the Silnas had expected the Spirits and Colonels to enter the NBA but for the ailing Squires to be left out, and the Silnas thought up the television revenue deal as a way to treat the Squires' owners fairly if the Squires did not join the NBA with the other ABA teams.  The Leadership and Public Service High School (LPSHS)  In the 1990s, Schupak partnered with the New York City Board of Education and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs and founded the Leadership and Public Service High School (LPSHS). The high school has since graduated more than 5,000 students  SportsCastr  In 2017, Schupak reunited with former NBA commissioner David Stern to help launch SportsCastr  Awards and Honors  In 2014, Schupak was given the George Arents Award by Syracuse University, the school's highest alumni honor.

J√©r√¥me Napol√©on was the firstborn child of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte and his second wife Princess Catharina of W√ºrttemberg, born in Trieste. The previous year they had been deposed as King and Queen of Westphalia, a kingdom created for J√©r√¥me by his elder brother Napoleon. J√©r√¥me Napol√©on's maternal grandfather, King Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg, had given his son-in-law and daughter the title Prince and Princess of Montfort, and J√©r√¥me Napol√©on used this courtesy title throughout most of his life. From 1832, J√©r√¥me and his family lived at the court of his maternal uncle, King William I of W√ºrttemberg. He studied at the military academy of Ludwigsburg and served in the army, attaining the ranks of Hauptmann (captain) in 1834, major in 1840, and finally colonel. Napoleon Joseph on his knees and sister Mathilde to the left. In the early 1840s he met and received the author Charles-Victor Pr√©vot, vicomte d'Arlincourt in Stuttgart, who wrote of the young prince: \\"Prince J√©r√¥me of Montfort, gifted with a handsome face and a graceful physiognomy, is French in spirit and in heart. He speaks and dreams of nothing but France. In speaking of the sons of that great nation he always says 'we'. His position at Stuttgart is brilliant; and yet it seems he would prefer the most modest home in France to the most beautiful foreign palace. I told him of the passing of Napol√©on; he listened rapt. I spoke to him of the coming of the Duke of Bourdeaux; he listened with interest. 'Eternal glory', the prince told me, 'to whoever makes France happy!' Such too was my thought.\\"Charles-Victor Pr√©vot d'Arlincourt, Le P√®lerin, Paris, Dumont, 1842, pp. 233‚Äì234. Of poor health since childhood, in 1845 J√©r√¥me sought leave to let him enter France, to visit Vernet-les-Bains with its celebrated spring water, which the government of King Louis-Philippe I refused. He died, unmarried and childless in Florence in 1847, aged 32. As then the eldest legitimate son of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, he had stood to inherit his titles and claims; instead his younger brother Napol√©on Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte succeeded to the Westphalia claim. His own son Napol√©on Victor Bonaparte became senior male/head of the House of Bonaparte.

The show stars Aditya Redij and Mouni Roy in lead roles. The story revolves around the love-hate relationship between Prithvi and Meera. Plot summary 20 years ago, Meera's Mother ran away from her husband's house as her husband, Meera's father, got her engaged and married to a boy named Prithvi who was an orphan found on the steps of a temple. To escape this, Meera and her mother settled in Delhi and got her engaged again to a man named Akash. And to hide the secret Data tells all his villagers of Hardoi that his wife and daughter died in front of his very eyes in a river. In Delhi, Meera finds out that her Bittu has cancer and she needs all the love she can get. Meera and Akash don't know about what happened 20 years ago and they want to fulfill every last wish of their mother. On the day of Karva Chauth, Sudha secretly does the ritual by giving a call to her husband. Akash sees this and is stunned. She tells him of her last wish that the full family stays together. Meera hears this and promises that she will not marry Akash till she fulfills her mother's last wish. She reaches Hardoi and is saved from a dangerous bull by her father, who she does not recognize. To travel to Ramdhari's house, she meets Prithvi who drops her to Ramdhari's Haveli. There she meets Lakhan and Kalki. She goes through many problems as Ramdhari's lie had put a blindfold on all the people of Hardoi - even Prithvi. She brings her license to prove it, but Lakhan says that it is fake and that he can make a billion copies like that, hence burns it to ashes. Lakhan tries to ill-treat Meera by giving her to his men, but Jeevanlal informs Prithvi just in time. Prithvi saves her and she gives him a hug. He feels awkward. He finds out the reason behind her coming to the village and becomes her enemy. They both become enemies. Prithvi has always had trust in his Data. Lakhan orders his men to kidnap Meera and kill her, but while escaping, Meera dashes into Ramdhari once again. Prithvi also reaches there. Though Ramdhari knows Meera is his daughter, he lies to her to save his self-respect and appoints Prithvi to take care of her and keep her safe. They keep having small petty fights and Meera begins to call Prithvi Rambo Singh - Because of his extraordinary shape, height and attitude. Meera also meets panditji, the owner of a temple. He also knows that Meera is Ramdhari's daughter as during the escape, Meera had hurt her foot and the mark is still seen there. Meera tries to find the truth but fails. One Day, Data assigns Prithvi with certain duties. He had to keep cows at his home while crops grow on the fields nearby and the cow shed is built. Prithvi has to go for some other work and so leaves Jeevanlal to make sure the cows remain in his house. While then Jeevanlal gives some information to Meera that Prithvi is an orphan and all answers to all questions come from the panchayat. Hence Meera tells Jeevanlal to go and eat so that she can send the cows and ruin the crops. Lakhan, Kalki, Prithvi and all other villagers reach the fields just in time. Lakhan had always been jealous of Prithvi because Data finds him more responsible and assigns all duties to him. Lakhan puts the blame on Prithvi. Prithvi sees Jeevanlal and calls him angrily and questions him how all of that happened. He gets to know Meera did it. Prithvi drags Meera to the Panchayati Raj to punish her. While this Prithvi mentions to Meera that, the mother of such a girl has to be a poisonous snake. Meera answers Prithvi by saying that no one knows who is his mother and was left orphan on the steps of temple. He is born as a sin of his mother. This hurts Prithvi so badly that he leaves the Panchayat area. Lakhan enjoyes the scene. While then the Panchayat decides to punish her by sending her to the Haveli in the form of a maid. Kalki accepts this as she is the Thakurain. Meera also accepts this punishment as she feels she will get all her answers from the Haveli. One day Kalki orders Meera to clean the full house. She decides to go to Ramdhari's room first. With the help of another maid she enters Ramdhari's house and is shocked to see a picture of her mother mounted on the wall with a garland hung on it. In anger she throws it on the ground. Ramdhari returns from his work and questions everyone how she reached the Haveli. Lakhan tells him about the Panchayat's decision and also tells him what Meera said to Prithvi and said he thoroughly agrees with Meera and on top of that speaks bad about Prithvi. Ramdhari slaps Lakhan. Data also forbid Meera to enter his room. While then Prithvi removes all his anger by cutting logs of wood. He also ploughs the field causing painful sun burns on his shoulders. Jeevanlal comes to comfort him but Prithvi breaks the friendship between them. Prithvi also questions the Panditji what his father's name is and is full of grief. Meera later realizes what she said was very wrong and did not know that such a strong man would have such a fragile heart. Later in the show, a man does come in search of him exclaiming that Prithvi is his son. She tries to apologize to him but he does not forgive Meera. A Shradh Pooja of Sudha was being conducted in the Haveli and Meera tries to stop it. She puts lemon in the milk. Prithvi was made in-charge of the Pooja hence was blamed for all the mishaps caused by Meera. For the past 20 years Ramdhari had never sat in the Shradh Pooja. He had always given an excuse. This time he decided to sit, but it all went hap hazard. From the terrace a rat fell straight into the bowl of milk kept in front of the priest performing the pooja. They all stood up in shock and declared the Pooja unlucky and left without saying anything. Meera went to the balcony and was proud and happy that she had stopped the pooja. Prithvi came from behind, gave her a push and almost sent her off the parapet, but held her hand. He dropped her and caught her thrice. She told him that if he kills her what answer would he give his Data? After hearing this, Prithvi brought her back but she fell into his arms. A few days later Prithvi tells Meera that Data is waiting for his wife and daughter. Meera, In happiness goes to the Haveli thinking that he has accepted her as her daughter. He stands at the entrance of his house with his arms open. Meera was about to run into his arms when another girl named Sunheri hugs him. She turns out to be Data's daughter. Another lady, Prabha, who turns about to be Data's second wife also comes. Meera just stands there in shock and feels betrayed. Prabha was the one who had taken care of Prithvi since he was a child. A few days later, Kalki gets a feeling that Meera is really Sudha's daughter. She sees Meera talking to the hospital where her mother was getting cured. As soon as Meera goes from there, Kalki jots down the number and address of City Hospital and sends Lakhan there. Lakhan reaches, points a gun to a nurse and kicks her too. He then gets a straight whack from a lady who turns out to be Sudha. Lakhan doesn't reply just stands there in shock. He leaves from there and tells Kalki what the truth is. Kalki performs emotional drama in front of Meera calling her Miu, her childhood name and calling her mother Sudha \\"Behenji\\". She tells Meera that a few days later a ceremony will be held for Data by the people of Hardoi to show their respect for him. In this ceremony a video is prepared for Ramdhari. In this video, the achievements of Ramdhari were shown. Suddenly, a video of Sudha and Meera was played. Meera sat there in shock. She wondered how her video reached the village. Prithvi tells the people that they are so stupid that they are pointing fingers at the person who had managed the lives of the people. Prithvi says the reason for all this error was Meera. He throws her in front of him. She tells Prithvi that she is not responsible for any of this and that Prithvi had no other choice but to believe her. Prithvi was about to continue the argument but the villager said that it is not the question about who did this, the question is ‚Äì Is Sudha Alive? Data agrees. Data finally accepts Meera as his daughter. In shame and shock Prithvi stood there. The Panchs said that Data had said a very big lie. He would have to give up his Sarpanch Ki Pagdi. He agreed and was about to leave with Meera to Delhi but was stopped by the members of the Panchayati Raj System. They said he was forbidden to go out of the village till his punishment term got over. Meera pleaded them by saying whatever her mother did not do she will fulfill it. The next day Prithvi dragged Meera to a new room from the loft room as told by Prabha. Lakhan got angry and asked Prithvi what he was doing. They got physical but were stopped by Data. Prabha came and told Data that she told Prithvi to give a new room to Meera as she was the daughter of the house. The next day Sarpanch came and told Data to give up his role of being a Sarpanch. He was about to give the Pagdi but was stopped by his daughter, Meera. Lakhan was shocked. Lakhan told Data to tell Meera what her mother had done 20 years back. The truth was that Prithvi and Meera were engaged. In sadness Meera deleted the photos of Akash from her phone. That night Data sends Meera back to Delhi. Lakhan saw this. He informed the driver to bring her back the next day. When Data came home the next day, he was shocked to see a group of men with sticks all ready to beat up Ramdhari. They begin to beat up Ramdhari but are stopped by Prabha and Sunheri. Later they are about to blacken Data's face but are stopped by Meera. Prithvi also comes. Meera pleaded the villagers that if they wanted her to marry Prithvi, she would. Prithvi was confused and asked her what nonsense she was spitting out. Lakhan explains everything to Prithvi. Meera also says that she will marry Prithvi in the next 24 hours. Lakhan is shocked and sad that his plan failed. He again orders his men to kidnap Meera by making her faint. The servant of the house sees this and tells Prithvi and Data. Prithvi fights with all of them. He picks her up and tries to awaken her. She wakes up and tells Prithvi that they are forced to get married. It's for the happiness of Datta. Datta arrives and so do the members of the Panchayat. They feel that Data had tried to kill her daughter. They asked if Datta had any answers to all this. Data stood dumbstruck. Prithvi said he has an answer. He removed his holy necklace and put it on Meera like a Mangalsutra. He had got hurt badly while fighting and his hand was bleeding. With that he put a mark on Meera's forehead as Sindoor. While all this Meera cried and Lakhan cried in sorrow. Data was about to take the newly wed couple home but Lakhan stopped them and said it looks bad if the bride goes to her own house with her husband. It is against Indian Culture. Meera should stay in Prithvi's house. Prabha dresses Meera up like a pretty bride and she performs the ritual of throwing rice behind yourself and your husband while leaving your mother's house. They stay together for just a few days. Then the day came when Meera performed the ritual of Mukh Dikhai. On that very same day Sudha tracks Meera somehow and ends up in Meera's Mukh Dikhai ritual. Sudha gets worked up and forces Meera to leave with her for Delhi when Prithvi and Data try to stop her. The village does not agree on sending Meera away from Prithvi. The people of Hardoi celebrate Meera and Prithvi's marriage too. A tycoon business man, Rajeev reveals that he his Prithvi's father and he has returned for Prithvi. He also reveals that Prithvi's mother, Nirmala is no more. In place of her is Kiran, who is now Prithvi's stepmother. Surprisingly, Kiran is the mother of Akash and his sister Sanjana. Prithvi is taken aback. He is not very keen on going back with Rajeev as he does not trust them. He also is heart broken as Data had hidden this secret from him. At the same time, Meera know admits that she is deeply in love with Prithvi. Somehow she had to go with him. Akash sympathizes and executes a plan. He instructs Meera to pretend that she is willing to marry Akash. In turn she will be able to return with him to Rajeev's bungalow. They meet Kiran, Rajeev's eavesdropping sister, Komal, Rajeev's wife, Sanjana, Akash's modern, stylish sister and later, Dadi, the eldest member of the family. Komal, Kiran and Sanjana can't stand Prithvi at all. Kiran decides to leave the house as Prithvi drove her crazy. Prithvi finds it hard to adapt to city life. He also attempted to wear western clothes at a party but ended up embarrassed, as everyone laughed at him. One day, Prithvi notices Rahul and Sanjana, who were having an affair with each other, romancing around in a corner. Prithvi questions her about her \\"Ghar Ke Sanskaar\\". Rahul tells Prithvi to \\"back off\\" resulting in a fight. Sanjana warns Prithvi to never come into the personal matters of her life while Rahul escapes. One day Prithvi went to the market to buy somethings when a message is flung to him. It says to leave the city and to return wherever he came from. He looks around but sees nobody. One night Prithvi is sleeping when he is almost attacked by a man with a knife, But Prithvi's amazing sixth sense helped him to shield himself. At first everyone presumes that it is Rahul but the truth opens up later in the story. Meera and Prithvi constantly have romance moments with each other and slowly Prithvi develops feelings for Meera, but does not want to express or admit that he loves Meera. Meera tries a lot to make him reveal what his heart feels, but stubborn Prithvi - He'll never do such a thing. On the engagement day of Meera and Akash, Prithvi tells Akash that he is in love with Meera and can't stay without her. Aakash says that he is very happy and tells Prithvi to buy a gift for her. Akash creates a huge misunderstanding between Prithvi and Meera. Prithvi wanted to show his love and brought a Pearl Set for his lover. He calls Meera to the poolside in ten minutes. Meera was SO excited that she went straight away forgetting. She sees a shadow and without thinking or seeing hugs the person when that person is Akash! Prithvi sees from the back as what Meera wanted to say to Prithvi, was being told to Akash. Prithvi feels that he has been dumped. It is revealed that it was Akash who still loves Meera and want to kill Prithvi. Akash thinks that Prithvi will not survive and hits Prithvi from behind with a bat sending Prithvi in the pool. Akash thinks he has killed Prithvi. Meera asks Akash where Prithvi is. Prithvi regains his consciousness. Prithvi attacks Rahul thinking that he tried to kill him. Prithvi persuades Akash and Meera to exchange the rings, Meera faints. The engagement party is over. Meera confronts Prithvi for being rude to her but Prithvi ignores her and leaves. Meera finds a link of the rosary, which Prithvi had brought for her. She figures out that Prithvi had come to the poolside to meet her, and misunderstood about her relationship with Akash. Meera wants to patch up with Prithvi. She tries to clear their misunderstandings in front of Akash. Nevertheless, Prithvi disbelieves her. Aakash pretends to be concerned about Meera and Prithvi, but Prithvi asks him to strengthen his relationship with Meera. Meera becomes outraged at Prithvi for not trusting her. Akash becomes overwhelmed on seeing their dispute and desires to win Meera‚Äôs love. Rajiv and Akash want Prithvi to support them in their business. Dadi asks Meera to patch up with Prithvi. Akash introduces Prithvi to his employees as his elder brother and appoints him as the head of his company. Meera visits Akash's office and becomes embarrassed on seeing Prithvi being insulted by the employees. She berates them for misbehaving with him. Nevertheless, Prithvi ignores her. Akash rusticates one of his employees for taunting Prithvi. Meera asks Reena to order food for Akash. Prithvi agrees to go to a meeting with Reena. Reena wants to impress Prithvi, but he hates her gesture. Akash intends to ruin Prithvi and Meera's relationship. He asks Reena to blackmail Prithvi in order to expose his immoral character to Meera. However, Akash fails in his attempt. Reena praises Prithvi for rescuing her from Rohan and considers him as her brother. Meera becomes impressed with Prithvi. Prithvi performs the rituals of Holika Dahan in front of Meera and Aakash's family. Meera asks him to play Holi with her. After much struggle, Meera and Prithvi finally marry. Ramdhari and Sudha are able to make Prithvi confess his love for Meera. This leaves Akash sad, worried and full of anger. The story shows their ever changing relationship of Meera and Prithvi with their burning love story. Their relationship which breaks easily, But deep in the heart, it holds them together forever. Such a Fragile relationship. This newly - wed couple break apart as Prithvi misunderstands Meera, after he feels that Meera has lied to him. Akash snatches away Meera's mangalsutra from her neck without her knowing it. Prithvi becomes so infuriated, that he even attempts to jump into the swimming pool to get it. Akash advises Meera to buy a similar mangalsutra and tell Prithvi that she has found it. So Meera follows exactly what Akash says and Prithvi becomes joyful and puts around her neck when Akash comes in screaming deliberately that he has found it. Prithvi feels that Meera has lied to her and their cycle of hatred continues. Meera too is feeling something fishy about Akash. The burnt photos, sindoor replaced with ash, Prithvi being hit with a bat on the head, Prithvi's car having punctured wheels, Akash lying around with photos of their wedding and the Mangalsutra story. What's up with him? Meera feels that he is upset with their marriage. Akash feels that Sudha might know about his wicked plans and that she might spill the beans, this ruining his plans. He so murders her. Meera cries in anger and says that she will never leave her mother's murderer. And So Sudha breathes her last, leaving Meera and the whole family shattered. Meera somehow finds out Akash is behind this crime. Akash stops Meera from telling the truth to Prithvi as he already is short - tempered, and after hearing this he will kill me (Akash) and so he shall be sent to jail and they shall be separated forever. Meera realises this and remains silent. Prithvi soon realises to that Akash has done the crime. He is eager to kill Akash with an axe but is stopped as he sees a thread which was tied around his wrist by Meera, to calm him down when he is angry. Prithvi does not say that he shall forgive Akash, he will surely teach him a lesson. They make a plan during their SECOND Suhaagraat that they shall pretend to hate each other causing Akash to fall in their trap and possess Meera. They are to go to Ratlam and on the way they were to have a showdown but instead Akash goes in the other direction. Akash also forces Meera to remove all signs of Prithvi from her. Her mangalsutra, her bangles. She drops the bangles on the road one by one so that Prithvi can follow them. Akash then takes her to a deserted area and decides to marry her then and there as he had also forced her to sign divorce papers. Prithvi shall come in time, beat Akash and Meera shall shoot him unintentionally and Prithvi takes the blame. This will mark the entry of Shallu the wife of an underworld don, And how their love triangle begins.... It might look like Meera and Prithvi have a fragile relationship, but in real their relationship always holds them together.

It happened at about noon PST in the Tunnel Creek section of Stevens Pass, a mountain pass through the Cascade Mountains of Washington, at the border of King and Chelan counties. There were three fatalities and one injured. The avalanche was characterized as a slab avalanche, or across and deep. Three days before the avalanche occurred, a large snow storm dumped into Stevens Pass, which resulted in the unstable snow pack that was disrupted by skiers on their excursion. Avalanche The avalanche was triggered when fifteen of the nation's top free skiers and free snowboarders were making a run together. They had been gathered by Chris Rudolph, a charismatic marketing director at the attached ski area. One or more of the skiers triggered the avalanche below the top of the mountain. Starting at an elevation of and a slope of 42 degrees, it rushed down a vertical drop of , carrying away five skiers. One of the skiers wedged himself between two trees and avoided being swept away as the avalanche rushed over him. Another skier, Elyse Saugstad, deployed an avalanche survival airbag and suffered minor injuries, despite being trapped until her fellow skiers rescued her. The remaining three skiers, Jim Jack, Chris Rudolph and John Brenan, were killed through a combination of blunt force trauma and asphyxia. The Wellington avalanche of 1910, the deadliest in U.S. history with 96 fatalities, occurred in the vicinity 102 years earlier. It happened about a mile (1.6 km) to the northwest, along the Great Northern Railway, in the early hours of March 1\\\\. Media coverage The avalanche attracted a high level of media attention because of the experience and notoriety of all sixteen skiers and snowboarders on the trip. Participants included professional competitive skiers and members of the freeskiing media, including reporters and a photographer from Powder Magazine.

He attained prominence as an early member and \\"first historian\\" of the Wandervogel movement. He was aided by his taboo breaking rebellion against schools and the Church. He was received with some genuine interest but sometimes perceived as scandalous. His comments on the homosexual aspects of the Wandervogel movement and the role homoeroticism and male bonding played in the creation of European culture and institutions were fiercely combated. Bl√ºher supported these with a theory of the M√§nnerbund. During the transition from the German Empire to the Weimar liberal democracy, Bl√ºher, a radical conservative and monarchist, became a staunch opponent of the Weimar Republic. In 1928, he had the opportunity to meet the former Kaiser Wilhelm II, in exile in the Netherlands. Bl√ºher believed that pederasty and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state, which became a popular concept within certain segments of the Hitler Youth.David Thorstad, Speech to the Semana Cultural Lesbica-Gay, Mexico City, June 26, 1998. (hosted at NAMBLA's website here). Archived 2012-08-09. Bl√ºher later supported the Nazis but turned on them in 1934, when SA leader Ernst R√∂hm was murdered on Hitler's orders during the Night of the Long Knives. Since 1924, Bl√ºher, who had married a doctor and had two children, had worked as a freelance writer and practicing psychologist in Berlin-Hermsdorf. He worked there, after his retirement from public life during the Nazi period, on his major philosophical work of 1949, Die Achse der Natur.  Student at Gymnasium Steglitz  In 1896 Bl√ºher's father, the pharmacist Hermann Bl√ºher, his wife Helene and their eight-year-old son Hans, left Freiburg and took up residence first in Halle and then, in 1898, in Steglitz where the ten-year-old Hans was sent to the local Gymnasium. In his 1912 account Bl√ºher wrote: \\"The intellectual pleasures are the purest and the most perfect. They persist throughout life undiminished and constantly trigger new feelings of happiness. One should expect that an institution such as a school, which deals only with intellectual subjects, and at the youngest age of life, would almost have to generate a rapture of discovery and understanding: - And it produces just the opposite! The student works not only with occasional overexertion and difficulty, which is naturally unavoidable in even the most liberal of intellectual endeavors, but with an immense feeling of displeasure. And this is expected at an age which, on account of its tenderness and need for joy, is least of all appropriate. On these young shoulders, in fact, lies a burden which the man only thinks back on in horror and yet it is perpetually alive in his dreams. [...] The \\"science\\" learned in schools and the whole conception of culture which is represented there is indeed not free at all but entirely imposed. It is in service to all kinds of ideals and possible prejudices; patriotism and religion necessitate, in order to find solid ground in the student's heart, a quite considerable staining and falsification of reality. [...] Whence shall the intellectual joy come if the instrument is out of tune with the student who could well play upon it...?\\"Hans Bl√ºher: Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Zweiter Teil: Bl√ºte und Niedergang. Zweite Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1912, S. 152 ff. Later Bl√ºher's criticism was, in part, much milder and more grateful. School director, Robert L√ºck, who Bl√ºher had described as one of the somewhat narrow- minded Christian educators, underwent a revaluation in Bl√ºher's second version of his autobiographical work \\"Werke und Tage.\\" Bl√ºher praised L√ºck's life work and described his selection of faculty as masterful: \\"How he actually managed it remains a mystery to everyone. He had an obvious charisma. The college nearly resembled an order.\\"Hans Bl√ºher: Werke und Tage (Geschichte eines Denkers). Autobiographie. M√ºnchen 1953, S. 25 In his autobiography, Bl√ºher set his former school among the ranks of those gymnasiums to which he accorded a prominent role in German cultural life. Nowhere else in Germany was the soil for the dispute between humanistic education and the romantic counter-culture so fruitful; the Wandervogel and the youth movement could only have occurred here.Hans Bl√ºher: Werke und Tage (Geschichte eines Denkers). Autobiographie. M√ºnchen 1953, S. 16  Wandervogel Movement  Hans Bl√ºher was admitted to the Wandervogel in 1902 as a 33rd degree member. His initiation was a ceremonial procedure wherein Karl Fischer deterred \\"foxes\\" for each of the newcomers. After instruction of the goals and premises of the Wandervogel movement, the aspirant swore loyalty to Fischer and to obey when necessary. He promised this in the presence of at least two other witnesses who attested to the oath then Fischer wrote his name into the members' book. Hans Bl√ºher understood this community as a protest movement against the \\"weathered ideals\\" of the \\"old generation\\" which one should vigorously resist with his own views and experiences.Hans Bl√ºher: Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Zweiter Teil: Bl√ºte und Niedergang. Zweite Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1912, S. 189/191 Bl√ºher had a strictly dismissive attitude of the pedagogical tendencies and leisurely hiking of the group. For example, provisions that set early rest stops out of consideration for the younger participants were to him proof of \\"an insufficient understanding of the great experience of horror that the forest and the night also produced in the minds of the older members.\\" There is a weak disregard for the young personality in \\"breaking the power of such precious hours.\\" Bl√ºher even thought little of recommendations to call off hikes due to persistent rain so as to not negatively affect the clothes and mood of the hikers: \\"That is exactly what is recommended for the faint of heart who from the very outset admit that they do not have the ability to drown out the inclement weather with the exuberance of their youthfulness. Those who know the old Wandervogel bacchanalia and are no degenerates, also know the unforgettable glory of such rainy weather marches.\\" Even in his 60s, Bl√ºher spoke praisingly of those regions of Mark Brandenburg in which the Steglitzer Wandervogel found their weekend adventures in nature. This comparatively inconspicuous landscape wanted to be discovered \\"with the full fervor and suppleness of our hearts: this landscape had to be conquered, its divine word had come to us, otherwise us youth would have perished in the foul breath of the culture of our fathers. [...]The Nuthethal, upon which the first fire of our youth movement blazed, had imbued us with the historical force that had been in it for centuries and we partook of it. We came down from its hills and were a state.\\" These unusual formations of young people created a peculiar contrast to the rest of the citizenry of Steglitz when they returned home after an extensive hike: Hans Bl√ºher, whose strikingly gaunt appearance earned him the nickname \\"Ghost,\\" developed into one of Fischer's most loyal supporters but he also had Fischer's crucial support during his time with the Wandervogel movement. During a summer trip to the Rhine in 1903, Bl√ºher was sent home by expedition leader Siegfried Copalle for lacking identification, which did not meet with Fischer's approval. As a result, he defended him. Another exceedingly lasting impression on Hans Bl√ºher was made by the wealthy landowner Wilhelm \\"Willie\\" Jansen who met Bl√ºher, himself an expedition leader now, on a 1905 summer trip from the Rh√∂n to Lake Constance where Bl√ºher won him for the Wandervogel movement. Like Karl Fischer before him, Wilhelm Jansen was the idealized youth leader who came to his authority through charisma and talent and not articles or power, as the teachers had alleged. Through the element of voluntarism, the model of the youth leader received an unexpected dynamism, which was generally described as anything from romantically wistful to fascinatingly mysterious. The self-education of the youth also made it possible to break away from the traditions of their parents' generation, which they considered outdated, and test out their own ways of growing up. For Bl√ºher, at least, Jansen was the pioneering personality of the youth movement: The motif of the naked body, pristinely and truly perceived, is found not only in the youth movement, but also in other life reform groups and schools of thought. In all these cases, reference is made to the noble and truly idealized nudity of ancient cultures. Historian of the Movement Hans Bl√ºher, who graduated from high school in 1907, spent seven years in the Wandervogel movement before leaving in 1909. But even then, he did not completely break off ties with the group, particularly as Bl√ºher stood by his early friendships during the split-up of the organization and reclaimed sovereignty of interpretation over the development of the movement at the behest of the movement itself and supported by Willie Jansen, who urged him to pre-empt another party's account of the Wandervogel with a work of his own. From the very title of the work itself, the 24-year-old Bl√ºher claimed to comprehend and explain the rise, peak, and decline of the movement. It was important to him, he wrote in the foreword, to tie together the seemingly unconnected factors and determine the moving parts of this movement. In contrast to the mere chronicler, every historian must confront this subjective side of his work. Bl√ºher interpreted the institutional beginning of the Wandervogel movement as a \\"stroke of genius\\" on the part of Karl Fischer against school laws and the state authorities, who prohibited students from forming their own associations. By obtaining for a number of respected Steglitz citizens positions as board members on the \\"Board for School Transportation,\\" he was able to establish the group on a permanent foundation and at the same time set the pattern for further initiatives: \\"This committee was the actual club. It was presented to the school and the names of the men ensured that everything went well. Quite apart from this was the actual youth movement with its leaders; it was ensured that the committee had as little as possible to do with it, only giving money and names and, as mentioned, 'vouched' for it to the public. The students themselves were entered into the \\"Student Book,\\" but were not members of the association but rather only on a list where you could find their addresses.\\"Hans Bl√ºher: Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Erster Teil: Heimat und Aufgang. Dritte Auflage, Berlin- Tempelhof 1913, S. 59 At the inaugural session, Fischer appeared with some of his loyal followers, including the apprentice mechanic Wolf Meyen, who, being the youngest among them, came up with a brilliant idea for the name of their society, as Bl√ºher relates: Meyen had seen the tomb of Kaethe Branco, n√©e Helmholtz (1850-1877) in the Berlin-Dahlem Cemetery and read its inscription: \\"Who has given you the wandering birds of science...\\"‚ÄûDIE ZEIT‚Äú, 31. Oktober 2001, S. 96 The association was founded in early November 1901; Fischer used the following winter months to recruit further suitable companions, who he could place in leadership roles for the next hiking season. Inititally, Bl√ºher took a smug, dismissive attitude towards ideas that the Wandervogel was a form of \\"pedagogization.\\" Thus, he polemicized against the \\"popular patriotic and bourgeois\\" ideals of their fathers, \\"such as those one gets to read in the newspaper and with which one applying for a government post can equip himself just so much as to be certain of a good career.\\" This was extremely well suited for publicity: Eventually, there dawned \\"a time that bore the stamp of modernity\\" for Bl√ºher in the history of the Wandervogel movement: The inclusion of girls in the Wandervogel movement was strictly forbidden by Karl Fischer, who feared a blurring of gender images, presented as polar opposites: a feminization of the boys and a \\"tomboy-ization\\" of the girls. The spirit and nature of the boys were exclusively assigned classically masculine attributes such as toughness, a thirst for adventure, discipline, boldness, determination and physical strength. Through their relationship with male leaders, it was important to develop their own individual masculinity, and not only by their separation from women and girls, but also from their own biological fathers, who were seen as unsuitable role models. The Wandervogel movement thus confirmed the prevailing social gender roles and practices of the time which barred boys and girls from being together without adult supervision. Critic of the Times and Taboo-Breaker: Pederasty It was not uncommon for Bl√ºher to strike an ironic or polemical tone in his history of the Wandervogel movement where he found that the movement had strayed from its origins or was spiked with the values of \\"the old generation.\\" He was allergic, for example, to the appeals of older officers who assigned national services and duties. In contrast, it was important for him \\"to muster up enough laughs to constitute the only effective counterbalance to the patriotism of the war club.\\" As a sign of inner maturity, he proposed \\"the self-evident respect for the love of other peoples for their fatherlands.\\" In 1912, the personification and idolization of the fatherland through things such as statues of Germania seemed laughable to him and he considered embarrassing the pledge of \\"loyalty until death\\" affiliated \\"with the systematic slaughter of other peoples.\\" Bl√ºher considered neither patriotic impulses nor a mere recreational purpose - moving away from \\"book dust\\" towards the revival of a willingness to learn - as decisive motives for the Wandervogel movement. Rather he saw in it an instinctive desire to turn away from the culture of their fathers in a Romantic return to nature: \\"A deep moral corruption, a nearly unspeakable insincerity in almost every serious relationship will prevail wherever young people are prepared by an idea rather than by their own selves and real-world situations.\\"Hans Bl√ºher: Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Erster Teil: Heimat und Aufgang. Dritte Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1913, S. 80 Bl√ºher's most consistent violation of the code of values and taboos of the fathers' generation was his affirmation of male homoeroticism and its influence on the Wandervogel movement. He had learned of the phenomenon itself during school lessons on classical antiquity. Ion of Chios was covered with a passage wherein Sophocles kisses a boy who is serving him at a banquet and falls in love with him: \\"The students had to translate this passage and thus got to know a side of ancient life that was deliberately concealed from them. They shook their heads and now knew much more than they had. They also likely found their way better in their own lives.‚ÄùHans Bl√ºher: Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Erster Teil: Heimat und Aufgang. Dritte Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1913, S. 46 f. In his memoirs, Bl√ºher describes the Steglitz Gymnasium of his school days as a place where homoerotic relationships were quite common among the boys: According to Hergem√∂ller, Bl√ºher himself is said to have attracted attention in these years through a series of homoerotic escapades. A hapless apprentice locksmith who fell in love with him, as Bl√ºher attests, committed suicide because of him.Hans Bl√ºher: Werke und Tage. M√ºnchen 1953, S. 220f. Ulfried Geuter, who evaluated Bl√ºher's private estate for his study, confirms its heterosexual orientation and quotes from a letter from Bl√ºher to his parents, \\"that it was only a question of will power and chance that tipped the scales in this direction,\\" because he had \\"bad luck in the inverted direction\\"Den Begriff der Inversion bevorzugte Bl√ºher gegen√ºber dem der Homosexualit√§t mit der Begr√ºndung, Inversion verdeutliche, dass nur die Richtung der Trieborientierung ver√§ndert und das Liebesobjekt ein anderes sei, nicht aber das Liebesverhalten. (Geuter 1994, S. 83) for years, which resulted in its waning. His beloved Louise, on the other hand, has had a hardly passionate but nevertheless uniform and powerful effect on him for three and a half years.Geuter 1994, S. 76 The topic of homosexuality assumed greater significance when Willie Jansen, who was serving as federal chairman of the Wandervogel movement in Berlin, denied the allegations against him of unlawful conduct in this regard, but attested to his colleagues naivety and ignorance regarding the homoerotic aspects in the life of the Wandervogel movement and added that they would probably be more cautious in this matter if the gentlemen were better aware of what interested themselves in the youth of the Wandervogel movement. \\"That was,\\" comments Bl√ºher, \\"an amazing speech, which was even more impactful since in fact none of the men, old or young, possessed any substantial knowledge of the erotic things.\\"Hans Bl√ºher: Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Zweiter Teil: Bl√ºte und Niedergang. Zweite Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1912, S. 120 f. Geuter authenticates Bl√ºher in this correlation by stating his work was \\"quintessentially a history of inclination, the second volume of which obviously served to pay homage to Jansen.\\"Geuter 1994, S. 69 Bl√ºher considered an observation made by Jansen during a personal conversation as fundamental to his own intellectual life: \\"Where does the vitality that is capable of giving rise to such a movement of masculine youth come from, if not from men who, instead of loving a wife or becoming the father of a family, loved young men and founded M√§nnerb√ºnde?\\"Hans Bl√ºher: Werke und Tage. M√ºnchen 1953, S. 231 Through Jansen, Bl√ºher also became acquainted with the philosopher and zoologist Benedict Friedlaender and was introduced to the \\"Gemeinschaft der Eigenen\\" (Community of the Unique), an association of homosexual literati, scientists and artists, founded by him and Adolf Brand. Brand published the magazine Der Eigene (The Unique) from 1896 to 1932, in which he campaigned for the emancipation of homosexuals and for \\"art and masculine culture.\\" Brunotte identifies Bl√ºher in 1912 as a member of both the Community of the Unique and the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee of Magnus Hirschfeld and sees Bl√ºher's early work as an intersection serving as the bridge between the various concepts of homosexuality and masculinity on the one hand and Freudian psychoanalysis on the other.Brunotte 2004, S. 72 f. To the first two volumes of his account of the Wandervogel movement, which discussed its \\"Rise,\\" \\"Peak,\\" and \\"Decline,\\" Bl√ºher added a third under the title \\"The German Wandervogel Movement as Erotic Phenomenon.\\" He had already anticipated resistance to the distribution of his writings prior to their publication - school director L√ºck personally saw to it that Bl√ºher's volumes were removed from display in Steglitz bookstores, which did not noticeably harm demand,Hans Bl√ºher: Werke und Tage. M√ºnchen 1953, S. 33 and had the publication of all three volumes secured by contract. It was crucial for him \\"to suddenly ambush public opinion, to suddenly be there completely unexpectedly, and to be there in such a way that you could no longer be driven out from this position.\\"Hans Bl√ºher: Werke und Tage.

It was written and produced by Carey in collaboration with Broadway composer Marc Shaiman. Lyrically, it is about finding love during the Christmas season. The track garnered positive reviews from critics, with one describing it as an outstanding performance and the only song on the album that could compare to one of Carey's previous Christmas singles, \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\". It was released as a promotional single in December 2012. An accompanying lyric video was released, and Carey has performed \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" live on NBC's Christmas in Rockefeller Centre event and during her December 2014 Beacon Theatre residency called All I Want For Christmas Is You, A Night of Joy & Festivity. Background and composition \\"Christmas Time is in the Air Again\\" is an original composition written and produced by Carey with Broadway composer Marc Shaiman for Carey's second Christmas album/thirteenth studio album Merry Christmas II You (2010). It was recorded by Brian Garten at multiple recording studios, including Henson Studios, 20th Century Fox Scoring Stage, Guardian Angel Studios, Germano Studios, Capitol Recording Studios, while it was mixed by Phil Tan and assistant Damien Lewis at The Ninja Beat Club. An extensive list of additional and assistant engineers were enlisted in the production of the track: Brett \\"Snacky\\" Pierce, Scott Risett, Kenta Yonesaka, Alex Guapera, Charlie Paakkari, Tim Lauber, Tom Steel, Greg Dennon, Denis St. Amand. Aside from being credited as a songwriter and producer, the song was orchestrated and arranged by Shaiman, who also performed the piano. The ballad begins with Carey singing \\"Oh, Christmas time is in the air again\\" in her \\"whisper register\\", backed by a string section performed by Mike Valerio on the upright bass and George Doering playing the guitar. Other instrumentalists who performed on the bell and chime embellished track were Victor Indrizzo on the drums and Luis Conte on percussion. The orchestra was recorded and pre-mixed by John Richards and the concertmaster was Ralph Morrison; Shari Sutcliffe was enlisted as the orchestra contractor. Lyrically, the track is about falling in love during the Christmas season. Set in the key of D‚ô≠ major, the song has a \\"slow\\" feel and a tempo of 50 beats per minute; Carey's voice spans just short of two octaves from F‚ôØ3 to E5. On November 26, 2012, Carey announced via her Twitter account that \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" would be released as a promotional single. Critical reception The Village Voice writer Rich Juzwiak felt that \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" was the only song on Merry Christmas II You that matched \\"the magic\\" of her 1994 single \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\", describing it as \\"exquisite\\". He continued to write that it is \\"a sweeping big-band ballad that you'd swear was a cover from some Judy Garland movie you didn't pay that much attention to once. Not even Santa himself has the power to conjure the spontaneous nostalgia found here.\\" BBC critic Mike Diver was complimentary of the track, writing that, although the effect is \\"less instant\\" compared to the first single, \\"Oh Santa!\\", it fits in well with the rest of the album and is \\"perfectly formed\\". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone simply described the orchestration of the original compositions \\"One Child\\" and \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" as overwhelmingly Christmasy\\". In her 2012 single review of the song, Entertainment Focus writer Pip Ellwood awarded \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" four out of a possible five stars. She praised the composition for its \\"classy, soulful and sumptuous\\" feel and labelled it as \\"yet another festive classic from the Queen of Christmas\\". Ellwood concluded her review by writing that the release of the song two years after that of Merry Christmas II You should \\"get it some more well-deserved attention\\". Promotion It was confirmed on November 15, 2012, that Carey would be performing at the NBC event Christmas in Rockefeller Centre later that month. The singer performed \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" and \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\". Idolator writer Sam Lanksy wrote that she performed with \\"maestro vocals\\", but felt that her vocals on the latter rendition \\"eclipsed\\" that of the former. Carey also performed both songs when she appeared as a special guest on Michael Bubl√©'s 3rd annual televised Christmas Special, which aired on NBC. The song was included on the set-list of her Beacon Theatre residency called All I Want For Christmas Is You, A Night of Joy & Festivity in December 2014. The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica felt as though Carey was \\"completely undersinging\\". Carey released a lyric video for \\"Christmas Time Is in the Air Again\\" on December 17, 2012.

Gelsemine is found in, and can be isolated from, the subtropical to tropical flowering plant genus Gelsemium, family Loganiaceae, which as of 2014 included five species, where G. sempervirens Ait., the type species, is prevalent in the Americas and G. elegans Benth. in China and East Asia, The species in the Americas, G. sempervirens, has a number of common names that include yellow or Carolina jasmine (or jessamine), gelsemium, evening trumpetflower, and woodbine. The plant genus is native to the subtropical and tropical Americas, e.g., in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize, as well as to China and southeast Asia. The species is prized for its \\"heavily fragrant yellow flowers,\\" and has been cultivated since mid- seventeenth century (in Europe). It is found in southeastern and south-central states of the U.S., and as a garden plant in warmer areas where it can be trained to grow over arbors or to cover walls (see image). All plant parts of the herbage and exudates of this genus, including its sap and nectar, appear to contain gelsemine and related compounds, as well as a wide variety of further alkaloids and other natural products. The plant's herbage, in particular, is known to contain several toxic alkaloids, and is generally known to be poisonous to livestock and humans. Chemistry Numbering of gelsemine Gelsemine was isolated from G. sempervirens Ait., in 1870. Note, the use of Chen et al. is, in part, for the thorough manner in which it reviews the earlier literature on synthetic efforts toward, and total syntheses of the gelsemine target. Its chemical formula was determined to be C20H22N2O2, thus with a molecular weight of 322.44 g/mol. Its structure was finally determined, by X-ray crystallographic analysis and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, in 1959 by Conroy and Chakrabarti. It is a monoterpenoid type of indole alkaloid, and a close relative of the natural product gelseminine, which is also present from the same natural sources. The gelsemine class of alkaloids are some of a wide variety of the alkaloid and other natural products that have been isolated from this genus of plants. Gelsemine's biosynthesis, as of 1998, is thought to proceed from 3Œ±(S)-strictosidine (isovincoside), the common precursor for essentially all monoterpenoid indole alkaloids‚Äîitself deriving directly from mevalonic acid-derived secologanin and tryptamine. From strictosidine, the biosynthesis proceeds through five intermediates‚Äîincluding koumicine (akkuammidine), koumidine, vobasindiol, anhydrovobasindiol, and gelsenidine (humantienine-type). The related alkaloids koumine and gelsemicine also derive from this pathway (koumine from anhydrovobasindiol via oxidation and rearrangement, and gelsemicine from gelsemine itself, via aromatic oxidation and O-methylation). For the chemical synthesis (natural product synthesis, studies and total synthesis), see the separate section below. Summary of biological activities Full sections in following are devoted to specific activities of gelsemine. Noted are the facts that it is a highly toxic compound, where exposure can result in paralysis and death. It is reported to be a glycine receptor agonist with significantly higher binding affinity for some of these receptors than its native agonist, glycine. In addition, it has been shown to have effects on pathways/systems in model animals (rat, rabbit), related to xenobiotic- or diet-induced oxidative stress, and in the treatment of anxiety and other conditions. History Gelsimium extracts, and so gelsemine, indirectly, have been the subject of serious scientific study for over a hundred years. On the medical side, gelsemium tinctures were used in the treatment of neuralgia by physicians in England, in the late 19th century; Arthur Conan Doyle, the noted author who first trained as a physician, after observing the success of such treatments, ingested increasing doses of a tincture daily, to ‚Äúascertain how far one might go in taking the drug, and what the primary symptoms of an overdose might be,‚Äù submitting his first career publication on this in the British Medical Journal.[primary source][primary source] On the chemistry side, the December 1910 meeting of the Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, of the American Chemical Society, reports among the papers read, the \\"Assay of Gelsemium\\" by L.E. Sayre.[primary source][primary source] Mechanisms of action Gelsemine is an agonist for the glycine receptor (GlyR) with a much greater affinity for studied examples of this receptor than glycine. When glycine receptors are activated, chloride ions enter the neuron causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential, which, systemically, leads to muscle relaxation.[primary source][primary source] Toxicity and toxicology In mice, it has been shown to have an LD50 of 56 mg/kg (intraperitoneal), and a lowest lethal dose (LDLo) of 0.1-0.12 mg/kg (intravenous). In rabbits, the LDLo was 0.05-0.06 mg/kg (intravenous). In frogs, the LDLo was 20-30 mg/kg (subcutaneous). In dogs, the LDLo was 0.5-1.0 mg/kg (intravenous). The sap of the plant may cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals, and there are reports that inhalation from the flowers alone may, in some cases, lead to human poisoning (see below, where insect death at such flowers is likewise reported). The plant's herbage is known to contain several toxic alkaloids, and while there is report of its feeding to pigs, it is generally considered to be an abortifacient and lethal poison when livestock or other animals feed on its leaves. It has been reportedly used as a fish poison as well, e.g., on the island of Borneo. Human poisonings are known, including pediatric and adult cases, and in the case of adults, both accidental and intentional poisonings. At lower doses in humans, the inhibitory postsynaptic potential induced by gelsemine action at the glycine receptor can result in nausea, diarrhea and muscle spasms caused by loss of involuntary muscle control; at higher doses, vision impairment or blindness, paralysis, and death can occur. Children, mistaking the flower of G. sempervirens for honeysuckle, have been poisoned by sucking the nectar from the flower; its ingestion has been associated with honey bee (but not bumble bee) fatalities as well (e.g., in the southeast U.S.).In the case of Bombus impatiens (bumblebees), feeding on gelsemine may reduce the load of the parasite Crithidia bombi, which, in improving bee health, increases foraging efficiency, a possible case of selective advantage of a pollinator self-medicating through collection of an otherwise generally toxic secondary metabolite. See [primary source] It has been reportedly used, via ingestion or smoking, as a poison in cases of suicide, in China, Vietnam, and Borneo. Treatment Gelsemine is a highly toxic and therefore possibly fatal substance for which there is no antidote, but the symptoms can be managed in low dose intoxications. In the case of an oral exposure a gastric lavage is performed, which must be done within approximately one hour of ingestion. Activated charcoal is then administered to bind the free toxin in the gastrointestinal tract to prevent absorption. Benzodiazepine or phenobarbital is also generally administered to help control seizing, and atropine can be used to treat bradycardia. Electrolyte and nutrient levels are monitored and controlled. In the case of a skin exposure, the area is washed with soap and water for 15 minutes to avoid skin damage. While there is no current treatment to reverse the effects of gelsemine poisoning, preliminary research has suggested that strychnine has potential therapeutic applications due to its antagonistic effects at the glycine receptor.[primary source][primary source] Chemical synthesis The chemical synthesis of gelsemine has been an active target of interest since the early 1990s, given its place among the alkaloids, and its complex structure (seven contiguous stereocenters and six rings). Its first racemic total synthesis was in 1994, by W.N. Speckamp's group, with a remarkable first yield of 0.83% (given the subsequent range, prior to 2014, of 0.02-1.2%).[primary source] Eight further total syntheses have been reported in the literature, including from the groups of A.P. Johnson in 1994, T. Fukuyama in 1996 and again in 2000, D.J. Hart in 1997, L.E. Overman in 1999, S.J. Danishefsky in 2002, and Y. Qin in 2012, with the latter Fukuyama group synthesis (31 steps, 0.86%) and the Qin group synthesis (25 steps, 1%) being asymmetric. A further asymmetric synthesis using an organocatalytic Diels‚ÄìAlder approach from the F.G. Qiu and H. Zhai groups in China, reporting a remarkable 12 steps and a 5% yield, was reported in 2015. Potential medical applications Modern medical utility Pharmacological research has suggested gelsemine activities to have potential related to the treatment of anxiety, and in treatments of conditions involving oxidative stress. In addition, gelsemine has been noted to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Recent research on gelsemine has included investigations aimed at developing safer gelsemine analogs and derivatives that might allow safe application of the compounds beneficial effects. The identified anxiolytic effects of preparations derived from Gelsemium sempervirens are believed due to in largest part to the presence of gelsemine in such preparations. Based on a rat study, use of gelsemine has been reported as being potentially effective, where the comparison was to treatment with Diazepam.[primary source] Gelsemine has been suggested to have potential in offering protective effects against oxidative stress. In a small rat study, the off-target effects of cisplatin‚Äînephrotoxicity arising from its induction of pathways that generate reactive oxygen species, a factor impacting its use in cancer treatment‚Äîwere examined, and gelsemine was found to significantly attenuate cisplatin-induced damage to DNA, and further general damage due to oxidative mechanisms. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase and lipid peroxidation activities were noted, along with \\"increased production and/or activity of anti-oxidants, both enzymatic... and non- enzymatic...\\".[primary source][primary source] In a small rabbit study, the impact of gelsemine administration on parameters relating to diet-induced hyperlipidemia was examined, where gelsemine was observed to improve lipid profile parameters associated with hyperlipidemia to a significant extent, as well as to \\"decreas[e] hyperlipidemia-induced oxidative stress in a dose- dependent manner,\\" as determined by altered activities of a number of relevant metabolite and enzyme activity levels. The results, taken together, led the study authors to conclude that supplements of gelsemine to animals exposed to high fat diets may be of use in reversing the effects and in protecting tissues from oxidative stress resulting from such diets.[primary source][primary source] Gelsemine has been observed to have anti-inflammatory activity.[primary source] Gelsemine has been observed to have anti-cancer activity.[primary source] Traditional medical uses Preparations from the plant from which gelsemine derives, Gelsemium sempervirens, have been used as treatment for a variety of ailments, for instance, through use of Gelsemium tinctures. Applications have included treatment of acne, anxiety, ear pain, migraine, and more generally with diseases associated with an inflammatory response, and in cases of abnormal nervous function (paralysis, ‚Äúpins and needles‚Äù feeling, neuralgia, etc.).[primary source][primary source] Popular culture Gelsemine is used indirectly, via use of \\"yellow jasmine\\", in the 1927 Agatha Christie novel, The Big Four, where an injection of this natural preparation is used to kill the character Mr Paynter. It is then used directly, in 2013, as gelsemine, in series 13 of the ITV series, Agatha Christie's Poirot, as the agent to immobilize the character Stephen Paynter (played by Steven Pacey) before his being burnt to death, thus implicating the character Madame Olivier, a research neuroscientist (played by Patricia Hodge); and also, directly, to paralyze and immobilise Olivier and another character after their kidnappings. In House of Cards season 5 episode 12, Jane Davis offers Claire Underwood gelsemium as a headache reliever, noting that she should only use two drops. Later on Claire uses the gelsemine to murder Tom Yates, her lover, by putting it into his drink without his knowledge. In episode 9 of season 3 of iZombie, the victim is poisoned by gelsemine.

Early life  Fu Youde came from an humble background in Anhui and became an eminent field marshal. In 1361, after serving under a succession of overlords, Fu surrendered to Zhu Yuanzhang. After his brilliant campaign in Suchuan in 1371, Fu was awarded the rank of marquis, and when the Prince of Yan met him in 1380, he was serving as Xu Da's deputy, training troops, conducting patrols of the border, and supervising the construction of defenses along the Great Wall.  Rise to prominence  In the autumn of 1381 General Fu Youde was ordered to command an army of 300,000 troops in Yunnan--then still a remaining outpost of Mongol power. Along with Ting P‚Äôu-lang, Fu Youde defeated Basalawarmi while fighting under the Hongwu Emperor. Led by General Fu Youde, the Ming army attacked Yunnan and tried to subdue the Mongols. The Ming army killed an estimated 60,000 people and castrated the young sons of prisoners, according to an ancient custom. Early in 1384 the campaign in Yunnan and Guizhou was declared over and General Fu was awarded a dukedom with an annual stipend of three thousand piculs of rice. General Fu Youde came to Beiping in 1385 to take over the military command left vacant by the death of Xu Da. When Fu Youde took over the theater command of the Beiping garrison, he had about seventeen guard units with more than 131,000 men, while the troop strength of the entire country had exceeded the one million mark. In time, Fu Youde rose through the ranks of the military, eventually becoming one of the Hongwu Emperor‚Äôs most important generals.The Cambridge History of China, Volume 7, p.173.

Based on a study of the propaganda produced in North Korea for internal consumption, Myers argues that the guiding ideology of North Korea is a race-based nationalism derived from Japanese fascism, rather than any form of communism. The book is based on author's study of the material in the Information Center on North Korea.  Author  Brian Reynolds Myers was born in the U.S. and was educated on the graduate level in Germany. He is an editor of The Atlantic magazine and the author of A Reader's Manifesto, as well as of Han Sorya and North Korea Literature (1994), which was the only book in English about North Korean literature until Tatiana Gabroussenko's literary history Soldiers on the Cultural Front (2010). Myers has studied North Korea for twenty years and is fluent in Korean. He holds an assistant professorship in international studies at Dongseo University in South Korea. For the book, Myers studied North Korean mass culture with reference to domestically published novels, films, and serials available at the Ministry of Unification in Seoul. Myers claims his analysis differs from that of conventional North Korea watchers, because he focuses on internal Korean-language propaganda, rather than on Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) external broadcasts and English-language reports from South Korea.  Contents  The Cleanest Race is divided into two sections: the first covers North Korean history through its propaganda, from Korea under Japanese rule to the 2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea. The second section analyzes themes in the propaganda, including chapters such as \\"Mother Korea\\", Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, perceptions of foreigners, and South Korea. Techniques of propaganda analysis by Myers include translation of poems, discussion of metaphors and monumental architecture, and description of racist tropes. The book also contains sixteen separate pages of color illustrations, including reprints of posters that ethnically caricature Japanese and Americans and which portray the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as paternal figures.  Racial identity  unification propaganda on the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The Cleanest Race argues that the overarching ideology of the North Korean government is founded on far-right politics rather than far-left politics. It notes that the North Korean government is xenophobic and militaristic. It cites a report of a mob attack on Black Cuban diplomats and the forcing of female North Koreans to abort mixed-ethnicity children. It mentions that the 2009 North Korean constitution omits all mention of communism. The author argues that Juche is not the leading ideology of North Korea. Rather, he surmises, it was designed in order to trick foreigners. Myers says North Korea's government does not base its ideology on Marxism‚ÄìLeninism or Neo-Confucianism. He instead links it to Japanese fascism. He states that the government's racist criteria for national identity paints its genetically Korean citizens as innocent and morally virtuous (as opposed to foreigners) but militarily weak, requiring Kim Il Sung's charismatic guidance and protection. The author supposes that this may be a strategy by the government to decrease the amount of repression and surveillance needed to control that public.  Foreign policy implications  According to Myers, North Korean government propaganda portrays South Korea as a land polluted by foreign domination, particularly by the permanent presence of U.S. soldiers. Anti-Americanism is the cornerstone of North Korean foreign policy. Similarly, internal propaganda within North Korea portrays U.S. humanitarian efforts such as food aid as signs of U.S. cowardice and make no distinction \\"between 'good' American workers and 'bad' American capitalists\\" as the Soviet Union's regime in the Cold War did. He laments that North Koreans openly flout the \\"dictates of an impure world\\" as inapplicable to the pure Korean race.  Reception   Press reviews  Upon its release, The Cleanest Race received significant media attention and \\"rave reviews\\" in the United States press. The journalist Christopher Hitchens (who had visited North Korea at the beginning of the 21st century) recounted that after reading the book, he concluded that his earlier view of the country as Stalinist was simplistic and incorrect. Some reviewers confirmed anecdotal instances of North Korean xenophobia and alarm at the rate of interracial marriage in South Korea. Hitchens also notes some \\"obscene corollaries\\" from Myers' conclusions, including that many South Koreans feel the North Korean regime to be more authentically' Korean\\" than their own government. The New York Times characterized the book as \\"often counterintuitive\\" and its arguments as \\"wily and complex\\". Bradley K. Martin of The New Republic, however, warned that the book could \\"[play down] the Stalinist, Maoist, and traditional East Asian contributions\\" to North Korean ideology. Martin argues that North Korean ideology can be understood in the terms of Japanese pre-fascist psychology, including amae (dependence on parents) and banzai (wishing long life for the ruler).  Academic reception  = Journals = Charles K. Armstrong in The Journal of Asian Studies states that the conclusions of the book are \\"not news\\". He explains that historian Bruce Cumings, whom Myers excoriates, addresses the influence of \\"Japanese colonial militarism\\" on North Korea. Armstrong faults Myers for exaggerating the Japanese angle and suggests that North Korea is \\"actually closer to European fascism\\" than to Imperial Japanese fascism, because Imperial Japan lacked a charismatic leader and a mass-mobilizing party. Alzo David-West in Journal of Contemporary Asia claims Myers writes \\"in the tradition of 'axis of evil' cultural criticism\\", obscures the differences between Nazism and Stalinism, and overlooks the historical influence of Maoism in North Korea. He also says Myers does not cite the relevant North Korean studies scholarship of Han S. Park, most notably North Korea: The Politics of Unconventional Wisdom (2002); makes scarce treatment of the Songun military- first ideology; and claims Juche ideology is universalist-humanist rather than ethnic nationalist. Gerd Jendraschek in Studies on Asia says that Myers \\"downplays synchronic and diachronic variation\\"; he \\"does not explain\\"; he \\"ignores counter-evidence ... while exaggerating\\"; he \\"contradicts himself\\"; and he is \\"anecdotal ... biased and speculative\\". Suzy Kim in Critical Asian Studies explains that Myers reads North Korea through an ‚Äúinfantilizing Orientalist gaze‚Äù; he \\"lack[s] ... understanding of ... Confucian relations\\", \\"denies Confucian influence\\" and \\"chooses to ignore North Korean kinship metaphors\\"; he has \\"his own preconceptions\\"; he \\"conflat[es] North Korean solipsism and nationalism with racism\\" and \\"whitewash[es] American racism and Orientalism\\"; he \\"never interrogates ... representations and lived realities\\"; he \\"never contextualizes the different kinds of sources he is using\\" but \\"lumps together\\" a \\"Text\\" that \\"becomes a straw man ... to serve his own arguments\\"; and he \\"takes at face value\\" the \\"simple dichotomy between 'Koreans' and 'foreigners'.'\\" Craig MacKie in The Political Economy of Affect in East Asia says, \\"Myers' formulation of the 'child race' is deeply problematic as a result of the instrumental way he uses it in his text\\" even though the \\"work does correctly register ... filial and familial themes and the fixation on the dead father that characterizes propaganda in North Korea.\\"MacKie, Craig. \\"Familial Communism and Cartoons: An Affective Political Economy of North Korea\\", The Political Economy of Affect and Emotion in East Asia.

She had two serious collisions with icebergs in the North Atlantic, the second of which caused her loss. History Gananoque was built at Lauzon, Quebec in 1857 by George T Davie & Sons and sold the following year to Thomas Bailey of Newcastle upon Tyne. In May 1858 he sold a one-eighth share in the ship to Archibald Morris who became her commander. New Zealand trade She made four voyages to New Zealand in the 1860s under contract to the provincial governments. The ship was first chartered by Willis, Gann & Company for a voyage from London to New Zealand in 1860 and then for three more by Shaw, Savill and Company. The first three carried government immigrants; the fourth voyage was solely with cargo: * 9 February 1860 departing London, arriving Lyttelton on 9 May 1860. * 7 July 1861 departing London, arriving Auckland on 18 October 1861. * 7 December 1862 departing London, arriving Port Chalmers, Otago on 12 March 1863. * 16 May 1864 departing London, arriving Port of Bluff on 5 September 1864.

Crew abandoned ship and all but one were rescued. However, the ship did not sink, was found abandoned and taken derelict to St John's, Newfoundland, She was subsequently repaired, re- sheathed and re-rigged as a barque, and was offered for sale in 1876. Gananoque again collided with an iceberg on 10 May 1881 four miles off Bird Rocks, Magdalen Islands on a voyage from Belfast to Miramichi and sank quickly. The crew landed on Bird Rocks, and were picked up from there on 12 May. Case law The first voyage to New Zealand resulted in a High Court of Admiralty case \\"The Gananoque\\", a dispute between the ship's captain Archibald Morris and the other owners over contract payment terms.

Spanish rule on both countries was ended by the victory of the United States in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as provisions of the Treaty of Paris giving Cuba independence and the Philippines becoming a new possession of the United States. History Early history Cuba and the Philippines have been in existence for centuries. In the early 16th century, Filipinos reached Cuba via the Manila-Acapulco Galleon that linked New Spain (Mexico) to the Orient. Filipinos who were brought by the Spaniards to Cuba were altar boys, catechism leaders, and church workers. Pinar del R√≠o is famous for their cigars, which were brought over from the Philippines by the Spanish because it was much closer to Europe and easier to oversee. Afterwards, some Filipinos moved to Havana's big Barrio Chino or Chinatown. The Philippines and Cuba were both dominated by Spain Crown for several centuries, which ended at the turn of the 19th century with Spain's defeat by the United States. Both countries became under American rule after Spain ceded Puerto Rico, Philippines, and Cuba to the United States for twenty million US dollars. Later on, Cuba gained its Independence while the Philippines continued to be under the American rule. On July 4, 1946, the Philippines gained its independence. Formal diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Cuba were also established in July 1946. Contemporary era Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the Philippines were disrupted in 1961. Relations were formally restored with the signing of a joint statement by former Prime Minister Fidel Castro and former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos in Havana on August 26, 1975. The Philippines, despite being a long-time of ally of the United States, which has currently unfavorable relations with Cuba, has voted against subsequent UN General Assembly resolutions against the United States embargo against Cuba. In July 2011, both countries celebrated their 65th year of diplomatic relations. On October 31, 2012, the Philippine government closed its embassy in Havana along with three other embassies in Stockholm, Sweden, Bucharest, Romania, Helsinki, Finland, and the consulate in Saipan. The closure was part of the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs austerity measures and restructuring plan. The Philippines, however, assured the closing of its embassy in Cuba will not affect the diplomatic relations of the two countries. Presidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said in a news briefing, \\"There will be no effect, closing down of Consular offices is internal to us, so there is no effect on them (concerned countries), as long as we have presence there... we [will] have diplomatic relations. The diplomatic relations is not diminished by the cutting down of Consular offices in their countries.\\" In June 2013, former Cuban ambassador to the Philippines Jorge Rey Jim√©nez announced that they will close their embassy in Makati citing financial difficulties brought by the global economic crisis and the United States‚Äô embargo. All consular and diplomatic relations with the Philippines were then assumed by the Cuban Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Socio-cultural relations Cuba and Philippines share socio-cultural similarities mostly due to their Hispanic heritage brought by Spanish colonial rule for more than three hundred years. Both countries are predominantly Catholics, and celebrate town fiestas. The two countries also share the concept of \\"Padre de Familia\\" where the father heads the family and the mother, along the children, recognizes the father's decision. Spanish names and family names are also apparent among the two countries. People Filipino Cubans include the Azcarraga Fessner family, whose patriarch was Marcelo de Azcarraga y Palmero, the first Prime Minister of Spain with Indian blood, whose mother was a Filipina from the Lizarrabal and Palmero families. The Pinar del Rio Province in Cuba, was formerly called \\"Nueva Filipinas\\" in the 18th century due to mass immigration of Filipinos and other Asians to the area to work in the region's tobacco industry. Asians immigrated to Cuba through the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade route and they were known generally known as \\"Chinos Manila\\".

Biography  Ebere Onwudiwe was born in the ancient town of Isu-Njaba in the old Owerri province of Eastern Nigeria to loving Catholic parents, Mazi Simon Onwudiwe Achigaonye and Magdalene Nwamgbede (Memme) Achigaonye. He spent some of his childhood with his uncle in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and in Aba, Abia State where he attended Sacred Heart College, a Catholic secondary school. He left in class 2 as the Nigerian Civil War began in 1967 and joined the Biafran Airforce over a year later (Regimental Wing) serving at the Uli Airport. At the end of the War, he completed his secondary school. Onwudiwe was educated at the American College of Switzerland, 1979 and University of Science and Arts, 1980. He received a M.Sc. (Econs), M.A. (Int'l Relations) and PH.D in (Pol Sci.) from Florida State University, Tallahassee. He taught political science and economics at Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio where he was at different times director of the National Resource Centre for African Studies, and the Executive Director of the Centre for International Studies. He has also been a visiting professor at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; Antioch College, Yellow Springs and the United Nations University of Peace, Costa Rica.  Professional career  Onwudiwe is currently a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Democracy and Development, Abuja, and has served as a member of the Governing Council of Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State and a member of the Board of Ojukwu Center, Owerri, Imo State. He recently served on the Board of Economic Advisers to the Office of the Adviser on Economic Matters to the President of Nigeria. Onwudiwe has served as a governance consultant with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was a co- writer of the 2007 African Governance Report recently published by the Oxford University Press, has served in national committees of Federal Government of Nigeria and the Government of the Federal Capital Territory, and was a consultant to the Federal government-constituted Technical Committee on the Niger Delta. He was popular columnist for the Nigerian newspapers Newswatch and Business Day. His articles have been carried by all Nigerian major newspapers and internationally, he has been carried by The Christian Science Monitor, The New York Times, International Herald Tribune, The Congressional Record, The United States Institute of Peace, US Senate, the Los Angeles Times, and The Guardian (Nigeria) where he is a regular contributor  Television Host  In 2013 Onwudiwe hosted his own show \\"The Conference\\" on Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), the show was also available internationally on Nigerian Television Authority International (NTAi). On the show he discussed important domestic issues with various stakeholders in Nigerian civil society and government.  International Journal of African Studies  He revived the Journal of Human Relations changed its name to The International Journal of African Studies (IJAS), and became its editor from 1997 to 2007. The now defunct IJAS has published over 100 peer-reviewed articles, 90 per cent of them written by African academics whose scholarship often rarely make it into mainstream Eurocentric journals.  Afro-Optimism  Onwudiwe expounded on the understanding of Afro-optimism and its implication to development discuss in his signature work 'Afro-Optimism: Perspectives on Africa's Advances', which he co-edited with Minabere Ibelema. The view that Africa regressed the moment that colonial governments left its shores is widespread. This volume is a counterpoint to the orthodoxy. Here 13 scholars with specializations ranging from literature and history to philosophy and economics argue that Africa has advanced since colonialism and is poised to march forward in spite of setbacks and disappointments. The contributors to the book contend that development is about human beings, so they do not rely exclusively on statistical estimates and projections. Afro-Optimism is a book with a simple thesis: Africa is marching forward, even if at times haltingly and at a different pace from the rest of the world. A common view among journalists and academics alike is that African conditions declined the moment colonial governments left its shores. The chapters in this book cover Africa's progress in health, agriculture, transportation, cultural innovation, and economic advancement. The contributors to the book contend that development is about human beings, so they do not rely exclusively on statistical estimates and projections. The essays in this book discuss the advances African states have made in spite of, and at times because of, their experiences of European colonial rule. The contributors argue that in all facets of development, Africans had to overcome colonial obstacles or had to build on meager colonial foundations. Although the authors acknowledge Africa's disappointing performance in various respects, they stress throughout that exclusive concentration on African failures creates new and reinforces existing negative perceptions of contemporary Africa.

The responsibilities of SROs are similar to regular police officers in that they have the ability to make arrests, respond to calls for service, and document incidents. SROs typically have additional duties, including mentoring and conducting presentations on youth-related issues. SROs are not synonymous with school based law enforcement (SBLE) officers ‚Äì which are typically employed by a school district's law enforcement agency, rather than local or city law enforcement ‚Äì though they are often used interchangeably. This article is primarily about SROs in the United States, though there are also SROs in Canada. In Australia, they are called Police School Liaison Officers and only exist at High School level. History  United States  The first documented SRO was placed in a school in Flint, Michigan in 1953. However, the topic was not broadly discussed until 1968, when the Fresno, California Police Department looked to the school resource officer program as a tool to ‚Äúrevitalize its image in the eyes of its youth‚Äù. This early adaptation of the program involved placing plainclothes officers in the middle and elementary schools to foster a relationship between the local police department and the youth, which continues to be a goal of the program. Since the 1970s, the role of SROs has shifted from mentorship/education to crime prevention and law enforcement. In the 1980s-90s, SROs facilitated crime prevention programs, such as Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) and Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.). From the mid-1970s to 2008, the number of schools with police stationed on campus rose from approximately 1 percent to 40 percent.\\"Criminalizing Children at School, The New York Times. In many states SROs are the main enforcers and interpreters of the states' school disturbance laws. Although Fresno‚Äôs program began with non-uniformed officers, it has progressed into what is seen in most communities today: a uniformed officer operating a marked police vehicle, who is responsible for safety and security on the school property. This came after the federal Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 passed by Congress in response to the country‚Äôs fear of juvenile and gang violence. As a result, schools created expansive ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policies that were enforced by an increasing presence of uniformed SROs on campus. In the late 1990s, SRO presence on campuses again increased after the Department of Justice created a $750 million grant program, Cops in School, to hire over 6,500 SROs. After the Columbine High School Massacre, the Secret Service‚Äôs forensic profilers and psychologists were asked to study school shooters and came up with the Safe Schools initiative report. It was determined there is no profile for a school shooter, however most times the perpetrators path of violence can be identified because of signs (telling others, collecting or obsessing over weapons) and interrupted. The US Dept of Education, FBI and Secret Service recommend all schools establish multidisciplinary threat assessment teams consisting of a school resource officer, a principal, teacher and/or counselor all working in tandem on the same page, same team. Canada Like the United States, many secondary schools in Canada have hired security personnel to enhance the safety of staff and students. School systems, such as in Toronto, have engaged armed police officers to be in the school throughout the day. In 2008, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), in collaboration with the Toronto Police Service, institutionalized the SRO Program by permanently placing armed, uniformed police officers in secondary schools. However, in November 2017 the TDSB voted to eliminate the district's SRO program.  Purpose  Different governments, school districts, and professional agencies have varied descriptions for the purpose of SROs. The National Association for School Resource Officers details the SRO's role as threefold: 1) as an educator, 2) as an informal counselor or mentor and 3) as a law enforcement officer. The United States Department of Justice includes those three prongs, and adds 4) an emergency manager or planner for a school or district. Johns Hopkins University's Center for Technology in Education aggregated SROs‚Äô job descriptions across the country and identified seven comprehensive purposes for an SRO, including 1) provide law enforcement and investigation, 2) develop crime prevention programs, 3) training and securing school personnel, 4) establish a working relationship with school and students, 5) develop classes related to position, 6) assist students in conflict resolution, and 7) be a positive role model. In addition, SROs‚Äô are managed by different institutions depending on their location. At school, most SROs are treated as staff and report to the principal or other school administrators. When not at school, they are often managed by a law enforcement agency.  Crime prevention  Crime prevention is as a major component of being an SRO. National Association of School Psychologists contend that properly trained SROs trained in threat assessment play a key role in a school‚Äôs comprehensive safety planning and implementation. US Dept of Education and Secret Service recommends all schools develop Threat Assessment Teams (consisting of an SRO or liaison officer, a principal and a mental health professional and/or counselor) on school-based threat assessment teams. This multidisciplinary approach to violence utilizes a team approach that meets together to offer different perspectives to help solve problems. The team‚Äôs collaborative approach makes certain that each situation is carefully assessed so there is not under or over-reaction to a situation. The team should meet on a continuous basis for best communication. The team follows a decision-tree process to help determine if a threat made at the school is transient or serious. The multidisciplinary approach is preventive because it identities students that could be on the path to violence and intervenes to get them the wraparound services they could be needing to put them on a more positive path. Most threats are considered transient, however each and every threat must be properly assessed with the help of an SRO since the consequences can be so severe. Research from psychologists have shown these teams are the opposite of zero-tolerance and help to establish better school climates, reduce suspensions without racial bias, and help to prevent violence to both self and others. School resource officers play a key role as far as gathering information in identifying and monitoring a student for follow-up after a threat has been made. The most widely used Threat Assessment model for schools is the Virginia Threat Assessment Guidelines for K‚Äì12 schools. The model, tailored by psychologist Dewey Cornell, is evidence-based and has been tested in six controlled studies. The model always includes school-based law enforcement, most often an SRO. {Reference schoolta.com}  SECURe rubric  The Safe School-based Enforcement through Collaboration, Understanding, and Respect (SECURe) rubrics were created through a partnership of the United States Department of Education and Department of Justice. SECURe provides plans for initiating or improving SRO/law enforcement relationships with schools. SECURe identifies five action items for schools and law enforcement agencies to collaborate: # ‚ÄúCreate sustainable partnerships and formalize Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) among school districts, local law enforcement agencies, juvenile justice entities, and civil rights and community stakeholders. # Ensure that MOUs meet constitutional and statutory civil rights requirements. # Recruit and hire effective SROs and school personnel. # Keep SROs and school personnel well trained. # Continually evaluate SROs and school personnel, and recognize good performance.‚Äù  Outcomes   Prominence  In the 2015‚Äì16 school year, the following percentages of schools reported having one or more SROs at their school at least once per week: * 77% of schools with 1000 or more students * 47% of schools with 500‚Äì999 students * 36% of schools with 300‚Äì499 students * 24% of schools with fewer than 300 students Overall, 42% of public schools host an SRO and an additional 10.9% host a sworn law enforcement officer, as of 2016. In towns (defined as a territory within an urban cluster) have the highest concentration of SROs as 57% of schools in towns host at least one SRO. This is compared to 45% of suburban schools and 36% of city schools. Almost a third of public schools that host an SRO are more than 80% black, while less than 42% of the schools that host an SRO are majority white. The majority of large schools in the US have some sort of security staff present.  Juvenile crime reduction  It is difficult to tell if the presence of SROs is having an impact on the prevalence of crime in schools and communities, likely because it is difficult to show a causal relationship between the presence of law enforcement and crime rates. For example, in a 2018 study that compared Kentucky high schools that hosted an SRO to Kentucky high schools that did not, there was no statistically significant relationship between reported criminal violation rates and the presence of an SRO. However, a 2013 study that analyzed data across the United States found that schools that increase their use of police see an increase in reported crime. This conclusion aligns more closely with intuition because one of the stated goals of SROs is to develop better relationships between students, staff, and police officers which could mean that students and staff would be more comfortable reporting criminal activity to an officer. A 2012 report from the National Association of School Resource Officers sites national statistics that show a general decrease in juvenile crime and the violent-crime index since the early 2000s, when SROs became especially prominent in schools. They support this claim with a 2009 study that finds that ‚Äúwhen the results were controlled for economic disadvantage, the presence of an SRO led to a 52.3% decrease in the arrest rate for assaults and a 72.9% decrease in arrests involving possession of a weapon on school property.‚Äù While this is true, having an SRO in the school also significantly increases the arrest rate for disorderly conduct, even when controlling for school poverty, a more subjective charge that relies considerably on the discretion of the arresting officer, as opposed to something like an assault or weapons charge that it much more objective. This result lends itself to the idea that the presence of an SRO may increase the criminalization of behaviors that could have been addressed in other ways. Further, the decrease in arrests for assault and weapon possession could be from a result of students avoiding the SROs and taking these activities off campus, not necessarily the result of them failing to commit these crimes at all. In another article, James Swift also refers to the report prepared by the Justice Policy Institute. His writing further indicates that the presence of school resource officers does not lead to a reduction in crime. This is a similar problem with associating the presence of SROs with the decline in crime rates, overall. There are too many contributing factors to the occurrence of crime to draw a causal relationship between the presence of law enforcement and the crime rate. There are methodological challenges in thwarted crimes. There are hundreds of examples of serious intercepted plots throughout the US that SROs played an active role in helping to mitigate. The role will continue to be controversial because those stories never make the papers so credit goes ungiven. {source Echos of Columbine, FBI}  Teaching and mentorship  A 2017 study combined crime data from the U.S. Department of Education and interviews with 20 SROs to better understand how officers are spending their time between teaching, mentorship, and law enforcement. Overall, the study finds that while 75% of SROs perform law enforcement functions, only about half of SROs perform teaching or mentorship functions. The performance of these functions were also different based on the racial make-up and socio-economic status of the students at the schools. For example, at schools with students of lower socio-economic statuses, while SROs engaged in more mentorship than at schools with wealthier students, they also were more involved in school discipline and implemented more laws than at wealthier schools. The findings also indicated that SROs perform more law enforcement functions as the percentage of white students increase. It is important to note that this information comes from a single study, so more research is needed to draw significant conclusions on SRO teaching and mentorship.  Financial costs  A 2011 report from the Justice Policy Institute considered the cost of SROs as compared to other full-time employees at secondary schools. An SRO is paid at the rate of a police detective, which in 2011 was paid an average of $63,294 per year. This salary was more than both the average teacher's salary and average school counselor's salary in 2011. Opponents of SROs often cite this as a reason to not employ an SRO, as it may strain an already tight school budget. However, in some cases, law enforcement agencies have been known to split the cost of employing an SRO with the district. There are also grant opportunities available through the Community Oriented Policing Solutions office under the Department of Justice. Those grants made their first major impact in 2000 when the grants provided money to employee almost 600 School resource officers in 289 different communities.  Law and policy   Memorandums of Understanding  Because SROs are responsible for a number of tasks outside of normal duties for law enforcement officials, it has become common practice to establish a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the school district and the local law enforcement agency. These MOUs tend to vary in content based on the needs of the school district, but common ideas include the specified mission of the SRO, the organizational structure, and goals and procedures for the SRO. Other MOUs are more specific and include day-to-day duties of the SRO, where the SRO would be located in the school building, how an SRO will be selected, who is responsible for training, and chain-of-command issues. The National Association of School Resource Officers provides a helpful guideline and questions that should be reflected in an MOU to ensure the safety of students and to guard against legal action that could be taken against the law enforcement agency and/or the school. MOUs often fall short in clearly defining the school's role and the SRO's role in student discipline and maintaining a safe environment. As a result, an SRO may find himself/herself making decisions in the moment that disrupt the balance between student safety and students‚Äô rights. Kimberly Small, Assistant General Counsel for the Illinois Association of School Boards, recommends specifying policies, in line with applicable laws, on issues of ‚Äúsearch and seizure, questioning of students, and requests for student records.‚Äù  Federal policies  While the federal government does not have specific laws regarding the use of SROs, the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice created the Safe School-based Enforcement through Collaboration, Understanding, and Respect (SECURe) rubrics to help provide guidance to school districts. Students can, however, file civil rights claims against School Resource Officers. Kerrin Wolf, an Assistant Professor of Law at Stockton University, reviewed a series of Supreme Court decisions that have shaped the federal civil rights of students while in school. In her paper, she explores the ways in which students‚Äô rights are limited in three dimensions while in school: rights against search and seizure, interrogation rights, and free speech rights. * Search and Seizure: New Jersey v. T.L.O. loosened probable cause requirements for school officials in two ways: it required less evidence to justify a search and a school official can suspect a student of breaking a law or a school policy, which covers significantly more actions than just breaking a law. Vernonia School District v. Acton and Board of Education of Pottowatamie School District v. Earls further expanded schools‚Äô ability to search students by allowing for random drug testing for all students involved in extracurricular activities. However, Safford Unified School District#1 v. Redding placed some restrictions on schools by identifying strip searches as too intrusive. Courts remain divided regarding the question of whether school resource officers need probable cause or reasonable suspicion to conduct a search of a student on school grounds because they are agents of a law enforcement agency, not school officials. * Interrogation: In State v. Barrett, the Louisiana court found that a Miranda warning was not required by a school official to question a student. As far as how this requirement extends to SROs, In the matter of V.P found that Miranda warnings are not required in an investigation involving an SRO if a school administrator performs the questioning. In re Marquita M. took it a step further by claiming that holding a student in a school office for questioning does not qualify as ‚Äúin custody‚Äù (and, therefore, requires a Miranda warning) because it is not a threatening environment, like a police station, where coercion could occur. * Free Speech: In Tinker v. Des Moines Community Independent School District, the court upheld two students‚Äô right to wear black armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Since that case, however, free speech for students in schools has been diminished. In subsequent cases, courts have allowed schools to limit speech that they consider to be disruptive or counter to the pedagogical mission of the school.  State laws  Only eight U.S. states currently have laws on the books regarding School Resource Officers and/or police in schools. Generally, these laws only cover the definition of an SRO and mandate training. However, in November 2016, New Jersey signed into law Bill S86, which allows schools to hire retired law enforcement officers as SROs under the condition that they receive no benefits, can work full-time hours, are no older than age 65, and retired within three years of application to the SRO program. Controversies  Police brutality  There have also been a number of incidents in the United States in which school resource officers and/or police officers called into schools are reported to have used excessive force against students. Some of those incidents include: * In May 2017, an in- school police officer with the Dallas Independent School District (ISD) allegedly handcuffed and tasered a 7-year-old special needs student and, in that same week, another in-school officer at another Dallas ISD reportedly body-slammed and pepper sprayed a 12-year-old female student on campus. * In October 2015, a police officer was filmed body-slamming a 16-year-old girl at her desk in Spring Valley High School in South Carolina. * Also in October 2015, two police officers were called into Round Rock High School in Texas to break up a fight between students. Students filmed one of the officers choking one of the 14-year-old students involved in the fight. * A school resource officer for Tolman High School in Rhode Island fell under investigation in 2015 for body-slamming a 14-year-old student, leading to massive protests the following day over the SRO's behavior. * In August 2015, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against a Kentucky school for allowing a school resource officer to handcuff an 8-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl, both of whom had special needs. These incidents are among many that have caused significant concern over the ability of schools to control the actions of school resource officers and other police officers when they are asked to intervene in student conflicts. SRO's are not governed by the school board. They are controlled by the laws of the state in which they work and their agencies policies and procedures. When the law is broken by a perpetrator and there is a victim of a crime, charges must be brought. It is not the choice of school staff whether a law enforcement officer can act in filing charges. Increasing arrests of juveniles Student Resource Officers are becoming more commonplace in American and Canadian schools, leading to increasing concerns that their presence in secondary schools could prematurely expose adolescents to the Criminal Justice System. School districts across the United States are implementing criminal justice system practices in order to achieve a safe schooling environment; however, this comes at the cost of exposing youth/adolescents to the criminal justice system and tarnishing their educational achievements for situations that in the past would likely have been handled through disciplinary action within the school. This is seen by some as contributing to the so-called school to prison pipeline.Failing to include SROs in schools would be seen as leaving kids at-risk due to current trends in gun violence in America. The majority of schools are realizing the need to protect kids from these types of threats so they can focus on learning. School Resource Officers: Safety Priority or Part of the Problem?, Tierney Sneed, USA Today, Jan. 30, 2015. Retrieved 2017-12-03 A criticism of school resource officer programs pertains to the rate of juvenile arrests. In a 2011 article by Amanda Petteruti issued by the Justice Policy Institute, information is presented that indicates that school referrals to the juvenile justice system have increased with the presence of SROs. A high percentage of those referrals were for minor offenses that may have been handled by the administration had an SRO not been present. This concern has attracted attention and some studies indicate that the use of the Juvenile Justice System for minor offenses aids in a phenomenon known as the \\"School to Prison Pipeline\\" (pg. 13). To contrast, overall juvenile arrests have gone down according to data from the DOJ. If the proliferation of SRO programs in the US are adding to arrests, the data showing this correlation is missing. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) suggests that SRO programs should be designed to provide a different response for disciplinary matters as opposed to criminal offenses that occur on school grounds. This recommendation was intended to ensure that juveniles were not receiving disparate treatment based upon the presence of a law enforcement officer within their school. This can be properly handled if there is a solid agreement or memorandum of understanding between school and police.  Effectiveness  The February 14, 2018 shooting which killed 17 people at Stoneman Douglas High School brought renewed attention to the topic of police in schools. The police officer assigned to the school resigned shortly after the shooting under criticism of not entering the school building while the student was shooting. Given the frequency with which school shootings occur in the United States, critics of SRO programs are asking if it is necessary to have armed police officers in schools, if they cannot ensure students' safety during crises. The commission report showed that the counselor and SRO both recommended Cruz, the shooter, be Baker Acted and the mental health service system did not follow through with their recommendation, so Cruz was allowed to purchase guns after turning 18. The shooter in Maryland's Great Mills High School attack on March 20, 2018, was neutralized following swift action by the school's resource officer, Blaine Gaskill. As CNN put it: \\"Gaskill's response was hailed as an example of exactly what a resource officer is supposed to do in such a circumstance, particularly when contrasted to the actions of the security officer in last month's shooting in Parkland, Florida.\\" References External links *School Resource Office Programs TELEMASP Bulletin, Texas Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics Program *School Resource Officers: Law Enforcement Officers in Schools Congressional Research Service *A History of Police in Schools, by Brian Platt.

Continental-Kunstfilm GmbH (Continental Art Film) was a short- lived German film production company based in Berlin, formed in February 1912 by Walter Schmidth√§ssler and Max Rittberger. A large number of Continental- Kunstfilm's productions are now probably lost, although some significant films have survived into the 21st century. Continental began by releasing a mix of documentaries and comedies, together with serious melodramas by directors such as Max Mack. The company produced the first feature film about the sinking of the , (In Nacht und Eis) in August 1912. Joe May and Ernst Reicher early in their careers made a number of 'Stuart Webbs' detective films there; Otto Rippert and Harry Piel also directed films at Continental; and Gerhard Dammann wrote and directed numerous comedy shorts starring his 'Bumke' character in 1913. Studios Continental built a new glasshouse film studio in 1914 in the Berlin suburb of Weissensee; but when the German government consolidated a number of film companies to form Ufa (Universum-Film AG) during World War I, Continental was not included. The studio's film production dropped considerably after around 1915. The Weissensee Studios was acquired by Film- Atelier GmbH (FAG) in 1919, and was subsequently leased out to other production companies, including Decla-Bioscop who made The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari there in the winter of 1920-21. History 123 Chausseestra√üe Walter Schmidth√§ssler (also Schmidt-H√§√üler) was an actor who had worked with the Meiningen Ensemble at the Meiningen Court Theatre before turning author and film scriptwriter. He joined Jules Greenbaum's Deutsche Vitascope production company in 1910 as director and lead actor. He formed Schmidthassler-Film GmbH in 1911, which became Continental-Kunstfilm the following year. Schmidth√§ssler and Max Rittberger, an engineer and businessman, signed their partnership agreement on 5 February 1912, with a share capital of 150,000 marks. On 12 February 1912 Continental-Kunstfilm moved into the old Deutsche Vitascope studio at 123 Chausseestra√üe, vacated when Greenbaum moved all his Vitascope production facilities to 32-34 Lindenstra√üe. (Online edition of ) The building (fronted in red sandstone) in Chauseestra√üe was built in the colorful and decorative Jugendstil style. Continental's main offices were located at 235 Friedrichstra√üe, Berlin. However, Schmidth√§ssler left Continental after only a few months in April 1912 and returned to Deutsche Vitascope (the previous tenant of the building), going on to direct over 100 films. Memorial tablet to Heinrich Lautensack at his birthplace in Vilshofen an der Donau Heinrich Lautensack (who had also previously worked for Deutsche Vitascope) was engaged as script writer and head of advertising. He wrote the screenplays for at least five Continental films, mostly psychological melodramas: Zwischen Himmel und Erde; Die Macht der Jugend; Zweimal gelebt (extant); Der Mann in der Flasche; Das ist der Krieg; and Entsagungen. Several of Continental's early releases were directed by Max Mack, another ex-Vitascope director who had previously made his mark with one of the first autorenfilms, Der Andere with Albert Bassermann: at Continental, Mack directed Lebensbilder; Die lieben Freunde; Die gelbe Rasse (The Yellow Peril); Blinde Liebe; Die Hochzeitsfackel, and Zweimal gelebt. Poster for In Nacht und Eis, directed by Mime Misu The Romanian-born mime artist and ballet-dancer Mime Misu (Mi»ôu Rosescu) made three films for Continental in 1912: * Das Gespenst von Clyde (The Ghost of Clyde)There is an apparent paucity of reliable information about this film. * In Nacht und Eis, the first full-length film about the sinking of the which sank on 15 April that year. The film was made between May and June 1912. Max Rittberger, (the firm's co-founder) was an engineer by trade, and made the 8 metre-long floating model for the Titanic film (according to the cameraman Emil Sch√ºnemann, who also worked on Misu's next film.Cast and crew details at Cinefest.de, although Misu probably played the part of the radio operator, not Captain Smith. * Mirakel, a film of a religious mystery play set in medieval times, which was completed by October 1912. The play, The Miracle by Karl Vollmoeller, had been staged with huge public success in London by Max Reinhardt in early in 1912. Continental did not own the legitimate film rights to the production, which were acquired by an American self-made businessman living in London, Joseph Menchen. His full-colour The Miracle (1912 film) was released in December 1912, and Menchen and the film's US distributor Al Woods successfully sought court injunctions to stop Continental's distributors from showing Mirakel as The Miracle, as if it were the 'genuine' film of the Reinhardt Olympia production. As a result, Continental's Mirakel confusingly acquired at least six titles. See also The Miracle (1912 film)#Litigation. Otto Rippert, who had acted in In Nacht und Eis, turned to directing in 1912 and made around ten films with Continental between November that year and August 1913. Rippert later directed Homunculus, an early science fiction film. Before Harry Piel turned to acting he directed a handful of films for Continental in 1912-1913. The popular 'Bumke' short comedies written, starring and directed by Gerhard Dammann as the eponymous hero appeared throughout 1913, sometimes at the rate of one a week. At the end of 1913 Dammann left Continental, continuing his film career (possibly for contractual reasons) with the 'Luny' character: and Max Rittberger (the co-founder) left the business in early 1914.. Abel says that Joe May also ran Continental, although May and Reicher together published full-page ads in the trade press mentioning \\"the managers at Continental\\". In April 1914 he was replaced by as a new director of Continental for a year. was the cameraman for Der geheimnisvolle Nachtschatten (1914). May and Reicher Joe May made ten films at Continental, the first (In der Tiefe des Schachtes) being released in November 1913. Paul Leni also worked on designing various films with May at Continental, including Ein Ausgesto√üener and Das Panzergew√∂lbe. Ernst Reicher starred in May's second film, Vorgl√ºhen des Balkanbrandes (The Balkan Traitors), in early 1914. In the same year Reicher directed two films at Continental, Die Statue and Das Werk. Together they directed and starred in the first three of the 'Stuart Webbs' films, a popular series in which Reicher played a gentleman detective modelled on Sherlock Holmes: Die geheimnisvolle Villa; Der Mann im Keller; and Der Spuk im Haus des Professors. In an acrimonious and well-publicised split, May and Reicher fell out with their production managers over the 'Stuart Webbs' films, and left Continental together.Licht-Bild-B√ºhne no. 34, 1914, p. 37, quoted in & p. 307, n30. Having formed their own production company, Stuart Webbs-Film GmbH, they made the next in the detective series, Das Panzergew√∂lbe (The Armoured Vault) in June 1914, using Continental-Kunstfilm's studios for the filming. Harry Piel in an acting role 9 Franz Josef-Stra√üe In the summer of 1914 Continental- Kunstfilm built a new studio at 9 Franz Josef-Stra√üe (now Max Liebermannstra√üe) in Wei√üensee, a north-eastern suburb of Berlin. It was next door to the double glasshouse studio at no. 5-7, built in 1913 by Vitascope and separated by the narrow site of no. 8. (Online edition of ) When the First World War broke out in August 1914, May had to return to his native Vienna to do his military service, and on his return to Berlin he and Reicher split up. Reicher leased the studio from Continental and continued to make the 'Stuart Webbs' films with his Reicher & Reicher company until 1918. May formed his own company, May-Film GmbH, continuing to make serious films with his wife Mia May, as well as producing the 'Joe Deebs' detective series, in which Harry Piel directed Max Landa and later Harry Liedtke in the title role. The first three Joe Deebs films were premi√®red at the Union-Theater Lichtspiele, later the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz. May produced one more film at Continental-Kunstfilm, Der geheimnisvolle Nachtschatten, again directed by Harry Piel. May later rented Jules Greenbaum's Vitascope studios at 5-7 Franz- Josef-Stra√üe, almost next door to Continental. Albert Paulig made three Albert films in 1915, but Continental-Kunstfilm produced far fewer films after this date. When in 1917 the German government quietly consolidated the larger German film production companies into a single conglomerate, Ufa, Continental- Kunstfilm was not included. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari The studio at No. 9 Franz-Josef-Stra√üe, Weissensee (dating from 1914) was bought after the war in 1919 by Film-Atelier GmbH (FAG). The owner was Frau Cill-Gottscho of Philadelphia, USA, and the directors were Dr. Lucian Gottscho and Chaskel Eisenberg.Lucian Gottscho is perhaps best known for his bayonet designs, the S14G1 and S14G2 and the S15G, manufactured during World War I and fitted to German rifles like the Gewehr 98 (source: ). His B. Phil. dissertation from the University of Freiburg was entitled Miscellen aus der Theorie der Curven und Fl√§chen zweiter Ordnung unter Anwendung der Methode des Unendlich-Grossen (Miscellanea from second-order curves and surfaces, using the method of infinitesimals), Frankfurt a.M.: R. Baumbach, 1896. His books include Patentpraxis (Patent practice) (1903), and Wortzeichen-Register der Musikinstrumenten-Branche (1907) on musical instrument maker's marks and trademarks. He patented a design for a thermo-electric pile in 1900. * Chaksel Eisenberg (his first name is the Yiddish version of Ezekiel) patented two shoe-making machines: * * The property seems have been leased by Lixie-Film around the same time, and hired out to Decla-Bioscop from around October 1919. Decla used the studio during the production of at least three titles: Otto Rippert's historical spectacular 7-reeler Die Pest in Florenz, with a script by Fritz Lang (some interior scenes only); likewise some interiors in Part 2 of Lang's own Die Spinnen; and the whole of Robert Wiene's oppressive horror Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, from December 1919 to January 1920. The relatively small size of the studio (approximately 6m x 6m) limited the size of the sets, and some elements had to be cut from the planned script because of the restricted space. FAG enlarged the studio in c.1920 by building on the vacant site of nos. 10-12, to create 9-12 Franz-Josef Strasse. Lixie-Film- Atelier-Wei√üensee GmbH bought the studios in 1921, and later joined with a number of other production companies not included in the UFA conglomerate to take over the disused studios of Deutsche Mutoskop- und Biograph GmbH in the Lankwitz district in 1924/25, founding the Muto-Gro√üatelier f√ºr Filmherstellung (Muto-Atelier).

It is a sulphated polysaccharide and the type species in the genus. The species contains the phlorotannins trifucol, tetrafucol A, tetrafucol B, cis-pentafucol A, diphlorethol A and triphlorethol A.Fucols and Phlorethols from the Brown Alga Scytothamnus australis Hook. et Harv. (Chnoosporaceae). Glombitza K.W and Pauli K, Botanica Marina, 30 April 2003, volume 46, issue 3, pages 315-320, Distribution Scytothamnus australis has a southern circumpolar distribution and has been recorded to have been present from the waters of southern Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Description Scytothamnus australis is a larger, more robust species than Scytothamnus fasciculatus, but possesses a similar branching pattern and broadly comparable vegetative anatomy. Cell structure As with the other species of Scytothamnus, Scytothamnus australis has a stellate (star-shaped) chloroplast with a central pyrenoid and is perforated by channels of cytoplasm. Reproductive structure Scytothamnus australis has a unilocular sporangia reproductive structure which means that it can produce meiospores or asexual spores. The gametophytes are dioecious (Dioecy) but no structural difference can be detected between the gametangia of male and female isolates. In \\"Scytothamnus australis\\" the gametes vary considerably in size, ranging from 3-6 ~tm in diameter. Life cycle Sporogenesis Unilocular sporangia develop scattered over most of the thallus except in the areas immediately below growing tips. When sporogenesis occurs close to the tips of branches the apical cells are generally no longer active. Sporangial initials are from the cells forming the thallus surface. They can be distinguished at an early stage by their size and by the presence of numerous electron transparent vesicles. The adjacent vegetative cells (any of the cells of a plant or animal except the reproductive cells) are smaller in size and are filled almost completely with densely packed physodes (any of various vesicular intracellular inclusions of brown algae that are of uncertain constitution and function). As the sporangium develops and enlarges further the nucleus and chloroplasts divide a number of times. The sporangium is egg- shaped and lies within the cortical (cells in the cortex) and medullary (or pith) cells. It is slightly narrower where it touches the surface. In the beginning the nuclei are in a central position, each being closely linked with a chloroplast. In the course of the first few divisions the chloroplast loses its characteristic star-shaped shape and the pyrenoid becomes smaller and occupies a side position. Subsequently the nuclei are concentrated near the outer areas of the cytoplasm, and flagella appear to divide into separate types within vesicles before the division of individual meiospores (spores produced by meiosis). The chloroplasts meanwhile have largely regained a star- shaped form with a central pyrenoid. Mature sporangia appear as dark-brown spots on the thallus. The entire contents of a sporangium are discharged together with a mass of sticky material. As it slowly disperses the meiospores swim free. The side biflagellate (has two flagellate) meiospores contain one chloroplast with an eyespot (eyespot apparatus) and are capable of motion for a relatively short period of no more than 15 min. Upon settling they become spherical, measuring 6.5-11 gm in diameter. Each meiospore contains one to four relatively large lipid bodies in addition to the more numerous, smaller physodes. Gametogenesis Meiospore germination is usually bipolar or tripolar and they develop into densely branched thread-like microthalli. The filaments are 10-15gm in diameter in both species. Growth is the result of both terminal and intercalary(located between its daughter cells) cell divisions, and in older microthalli longitudinal intercalary divisions are common. The cells contain a star-shaped chloroplast having a typical pyrenoid. The way microthalli will develops depend on the conditions in which they are cultured. Prior to gametogenesis the vegetative cells of the gametophyte contained a number of large vesicles. Several changes occur following the onset of gametogenesis. In the cytoplasm, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) became noticeable and the number of membrane-bound electron-dense (possibly lipid) bodies increased. At a later stage these bodies accumulated in the vesicles. There is a single Golgi body in the cell which appears to be closely linked with the vesicles. The transition to the next stage is marked by the shrinking of the cytoplasm away from the cell wall. Following this, flagella appear within cytoplasmic vesicles and the paired centrioles of the vegetative cells take on the function of basal bodies (organelles that form the base of a flagellum or cilium). The flagella gains mastigonemes and takes up an external position. At the same time the volume of extracellular material increases. The Golgi body at this stage occupies a position next to the developing flagella and the vesicles with the Golgi body contain a noticeable core of electron- dense material. An eyespot develops in the chloroplast which had retained its star-shape throughout gametogenesis. The internal walls of the gametangium then dissolve and the contents are expelled into the sea-water. Fertilization Gametes are released together with various fragments of cytoplasm. The gametes of both sex are anatomically indistinguishable and remain able to move for periods of up to approximately 30 minutes. Fusion was never observed in clonal cultures. However, female gametophytes were identified in some fertile cultures after a volatile (volatile organic compound), scented compound was detected during a parallel investigation of pheromone production. Fertilization was a not very noticeable process by which motile (able to move) gamete (male) approached an unmoving one (female) and, following contact, the two cells fused rapidly. Many zygotes having two eyespots and two chloroplasts can be identified in this process. The development of zygotes and unfused gametes follow the same pattern leading directly to the formation of parenchymatous sporophytes. Germination results in a branched filament having a terminal (not produced within the organism) hair. Cells of the filament, frequently those lying next to a hair are transformed into peaks and developed into erect, parenchymatous sporophytes. Numerous hairs and erect fronds were often formed on the same individual. A variable, but usually small, proportion of unfused gametes give rise to another generation of gametophytes. After gametophytes had been maintained in culture for prolonged periods, exceeding 2 years, they failed to respond to the short-day stimulus, appearing to have lost the capacity to produce gametangia.

He was also a stage and television actor. He never achieved stardom, but was a familiar face in small roles in film and television. His trademarks were his Irish brogue, pronounced lisp and prominent jaw. Early life Gerry Duggan was born in Dublin in 1910. When he was 16 he moved to New York, where he had his early exposure to theatre acting. In the 1930s he moved to Australia, where he settled, although he worked internationally. Career He was almost 50 when he made his first film, The Siege of Pinchgut (1959). This was a British production made in Australia, and was the last film from Ealing Studios. Duggan was nominated for the BAFTA Most Promising Newcomer Award for his role as Pat Fulton. He lost to the 13-year-old Hayley Mills in Tiger Bay. He played the title role in the 1986 children's television series Professor Poopsnagle's Steam Zeppelin.

Gerry Duggan continued to act on stage in between film and television commitments. For example, he appeared in the British debut of Samuel Beckett's play The Old Tune in 1964. He played the role of McLeavy in the 1966 London revival of Joe Orton's Loot, which he regarded as the high point of his stage career, in a production that transferred to the Criterion Theatre. Later in life he resided in Beacon Hill, New South Wales. He worked until his death, which occurred on 27 March 1992 in Sydney.

The main celebration and the exchange of gifts in many families takes place on Christmas Eve, December 24. The Lucia Day is celebrated during Advent, on December 13.Sweden.se: Lucia and Christmas Christmas contains a mix of domestic and foreign customs that have been adapted. Many Swedes celebrate Christmas in roughly the same way, and many local customs and specialities have disappeared.  History  The origin of the Germanic word \\"Jul\\" is somewhat unclear. Around the year 600, it is mentioned in the Gothic calendar together with Christian religious texts. Around the year 900, the word \\"Jul\\" can be found in a tribute to king Harald Fairhair, in which someone is said to \\"Dricka Jul\\" (Drink Jul). The pretext for the Jul celebration was to mark the winter solstice when the days start to get longer and the nights shorter again. In Nordic prehistoric times there was a \\"midvinterblot\\" rite (mid- winter bl√≥t), which was a sacrificial rite held in mid-winter, which may either mean the same time as Jul (in later sources called julablot), or in mid-January which was in the middle of the winter period. The people sacrificed cattle and perhaps humans to win the √Üsir's blessing on the germinating crop. The √°s (singular of √Üsir) who was especially hailed at this time was Odin, who commonly went by the name of \\"J√≥lner\\". The Jul was Christianized, while the bl√≥t rites were forbidden and abandoned when Sweden became a Christian country. The celebration of Christmas at the end of December is a very old tradition with many origins. Among these is the Old Norse Christmas celebration - which was prevailing in Scandinavia in the 11th century - and was celebrated in connection with the midwinter offering celebration. Moreover, there is the Christian Christmas celebration in memory of the birth of Jesus Christ. The earliest records of these celebrations are from year 333. Eight hundred years later this is merged with the Old Norse Christmas celebration. In the Old Norse sources the pagan celebration of Jul in the Nordic countries is often described as \\"to drink jul/yule\\". The central aspect of the pagan Germanic celebration of midwinter was to eat and drink well. To bake and to produce ale and mead were important preparations for the celebration. In medieval wooden calendars and pre-Christian picture stones, this celebration is still symbolised by a barrel of ale, or a drinking horn. So the emphasis on food and drink traditions was originally a pagan trait of the Christmas celebration. The Christmas tree is a custom that was imported from Germany in the 1880s. The former tradition of giving joke presents, often a log of wood, was replaced during the late-19th century and 20th century by Christmas gifts given out by the Christmas goat (Julbocken) or, especially later, Santa Claus (Jultomten).Sweden.se: Christmas  Traditions  The month of December Advent lights and Christmas decorations in a Swedish window. The Christmas celebrations in Sweden usually starts with the first Advent in the end of November. However Christmas decorations and julmust might go on sale in stores much earlier, often directly after All Saints Day. At this time many people start to plan their Christmas and start buying gifts. The 13th of December is Lucia where most of the children and some adults dress up and have processions in preschool, school and companies. The third and fourth Advent is important for many families as many preparations are done then. Baking and cooking are common activities, just like decorating the home. A big shopping of food and drink is often done the weeks before the holidays as well as the last purchases of Christmas gifts. Many preschools and schools start their Christmas vacation between December 17 to 22. Many workplaces start the vacation later, between December 20 and 23. The start of the vacation depends on what day of the week Christmas Eve is on. The last days before Christmas Eve, between December 20 and 23, the greatest preparations are made like, preparing most of the food, buying and decorating the Christmas tree and wrapping presents. During the last days there are usually a lot of people in stores and shopping malls to buy things for the Christmas celebrations. After Christmas Eve there are two public holidays: juldagen (Christmas Day) and annandag jul (Boxing Day). Most of the families have holiday and are free from work, but some workplaces can start the work again in the days before New Year's Eve. After the New Year's Eve the schools usually have at least a week before the spring term starts, but workplaces often start the work again a couple of days after the new year.  Christmas Tree  A Swedish Christmas tree, outdoors. Yule goat. The story of the Christmas tree begins in Germany in the 16th century. During the 17th and 18th centuries the Christmas tree started being dressed with candles. The first Swedish Christmas trees were generally decorated with live candles and treats such as fruit and candy. Apples were often hung on the branches where the candles were located to make them more parallel to the ground. It soon became more common for families to make their own decorations with paper and straw. Some families preferred to build a Ljuskrona decorated with cut paper. From around 1880, commercial Christmas tree decorations were readily available in larger Swedish cities, the finest of which were imported from Germany. The day that people in Sweden buy and dress their Christmas tree varies greatly from family to family, but most have them dressed on 13 December and throw them out by 13 January. Commonly used decorations today include: baubles, candles, apples, Swedish flags, small gnomes, tasseled caps, and straw ornaments. The house may be filled with red tulips and the smell of pepparkakor - a heart- star, or goat-shaped gingerbread biscuits. St. Knut's Day (13 January) marks the end of the Swedish Christmas and holiday season. Children, especially, may celebrate it with a Knut's party.  Jultomten  Jultomten, or just tomten, is the being who brings the gifts at Julafton (the evening of December 24). The gifts are called julklappar, and are probably a modern version of the Yule log. Jultomten does not climb down the chimney, he delivers the gifts in person. This task is often performed by an old man who secretly dresses up as Jultomten and knocks at the door with a sack of gifts. The origin of the modern Jultomte is a hybridisation between the pre-Christian being called Tomte and the (originally Dutch) Santa Claus. A Tomte is mostly portrayed as a small, gnomelike spirit being who lives on a farm and takes care of it (or the family) while the farmer family are asleep. He might be a gift giver if the farmers treat him and the livestock correctly. The tomte is an echo of ancient ancestral cult. It is thought that the tomte was considered a spirit of previous generations at the homestead, and there are references to them following the family/clan, when they move. Despite its different cultural roots, the Jultomte (Tomte of Jul) is today portrayed similarly to the commonly known image of Santa Claus.  Food and drink  Christmas food, with Christmas ham, Janssons frestelse, meatballs, prinskorv, red cabbage. Dopp i grytan The foods served in Sweden during Christmastime differ per region. But here, too, homogenisation has set in, due in no small part to the uniform offerings of the department stores and the ready availability of convenience foods. Few have time to salt their own hams or stuff their own pork sausages nowadays. Traditional foods include a julbord which has been prepared with all the classic dishes: Christmas ham, pork sausage, an egg and anchovy mixture (gubbr√∂ra), herring salad, pickled herring, home-made liver p√¢t√©, wort-flavoured rye bread (v√∂rtbr√∂d), potatoes and a special fish dish, lutfisk. The seasonal soft drink julmust is also served at the julbord, as well as during the whole Christmas holiday. A traditional julbord is typically eaten in three courses. The dishes include local and family specialties. The first course would typically be a variety of fish, particularly pickled herring and lox (gravlax). It is customary to eat particular foods together; herring is typically eaten with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs and is frequently accompanied by strong spirits like snaps, br√§nnvin or akvavit with or without spices. Other traditional dishes would be (smoked) eel, rollmops, herring salad, baked herring, smoked salmon and crab canap√©s, accompanied by sauces and dips. The second course is often a selection of cold sliced meats, the most important cold cut being the Christmas ham (julskinka) with mustard. Other traditional cuts include homemade sausages, leverpastej and several types of brawn. It is also common to serve the cold meats with sliced cheese, pickled cucumbers and soft and crisp breads. The third course would be warm dishes. Traditionally, the third course begins with soaking bread in the stock from the Christmas ham, which is called dopp i grytan. Warm dishes include Swedish meatballs (k√∂ttbullar), small fried hot dog sausages (prinskorv), roasted pork ribs (revbensspj√§ll), and warm potato casserole, matchstick potatoes layered with cream, onion and sprats called Janssons frestelse (literally \\"Jansson's Temptation\\"). Other dishes are pork sausages (fl√§skkorv), smoked pork and potato sausages (isterband), cabbage rolls (k√•ldolmar), baked beans, omelette with shrimps or mushrooms covered with b√©chamel sauce. Side dishes include beetroot salad in mayonnaise and warm stewed red, green or brown cabbage. Lutfisk, lyed fish made of stockfish (dried ling or cod) served with boiled potato, thick white sauce and green peas can be served with the warm dishes or as a separate fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include rice pudding (risgrynsgr√∂t), sprinkled with cinnamon powder. Traditionally, an almond is hidden in the bowl of rice pudding and whoever finds it receives a small prize or is recognised for having good luck. Julbord is served from early December until just before Christmas at restaurants and until Epiphany in some homes. The ham is either boiled, or broiled and then painted and glazed with a mixture of egg, breadcrumbs and mustard. Beer and the occasional snaps are common beverages to this Christmas meal. Mulled wine gl√∂gg, ginger nuts and saffron buns are served throughout December. Many Swedes visit the service on Advent Sunday, the Midnight Mass on December 24 or the early morning Christmas Day service.(Julotta).

J Mater Sci 41, 597‚Äì609 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-6476-0. The internal stress will build up as grains slide until the stress balances out with the external applied stress. For example, when a uniaxial tensile stress is applied on a sample, grains move to accommodate the elongation and the number of grains along the direction of applied stress increases.  Lifshitz Sliding  Lifshitz sliding only occurs with Nabarro-Herring and Coble creepLangdon, T.G. Grain boundary sliding revisited: Developments in sliding over four decades. J Mater Sci 41, 597‚Äì609 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-6476-0. The sliding motion is accommodated by the diffusion of vacancies from induced stresses and the grain shape changes during the process. For example, when a uniaxial tensile stress is applied, diffusion will occur within grains and the grain will elongate in the same direction as the applied stress. There will not be an increase in number of grains along the direction of applied stress.  Nanomaterials  Nano- crystalline materials, or nanomaterials, have fine grains which helps suppress lattice creep. This is beneficial for relatively low temperature operations as it impedes dislocations motion or diffusion due to high volume fraction of grain boundaries. However, fine grains are undesirable at high temperature due to the increased probability of grain boundary slidingSergueeva, A.V., Mara, N.A. & Mukherjee, A.K. Grain boundary sliding in nanomaterials at elevated temperatures. J Mater Sci 42, 1433‚Äì1438 (2007). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0697-0.  Prevention  Grain shape plays a large role in determining the sliding rate and extent. Thus, by controlling the grain size and shape, the amount of grain boundary sliding can be limited. Generally, materials with coarser grains are preferred, as the material will have less grain boundaries. Ideally, single crystals will completely suppress this mechanism as the sample will not have any grain boundaries. Another method is to reinforce grain boundaries by adding precipitates. Small precipitates located at grain boundaries can pin grain boundaries and prevent grains from sliding against each other. However, not all precipitates are desirable at boundaries. Large precipitates may have the opposite effect on grain boundary pinning as it allows more gaps or vacancies between grains to accommodate the precipitates, which reduces the pinning effect.

Early life The second son of Thomas Le Blanc of Charterhouse Square, London, he was born about 1748. In June 1766 he was admitted a pensioner, and in the following November elected scholar of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In February 1773 he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, and he graduated LL.B. the same year. In 1779 he was elected a Fellow of his college. Legal career Le Blanc went the Norfolk circuit, acquired a considerable practice, and in February 1787 was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law. In 1791 he was appointed counsel to his university, and in this capacity was one of the counsel retained to show cause against a rule obtained by William Frend for a mandamus to restore him to his franchises as resident M.A. On the resignation of Sir William Henry Ashurst, 9 June 1799, Le Blanc was appointed to succeed him as puisne judge of the king's bench, and knighted. He showed his independence of mind in the case of Haycraft v. Creasy (2 East 92), where he differed from Lord Kenyon, on a point of law which the latter had long treated as established. For his part in two trials for murder on the high seas, which had terminated in acquittals in December 1807 and January 1808, he was charged in the Independent Whig with perverting justice out of mistaken humanity; though. the responsibility for the verdict in both cases rested with the jury. The attorney-general filed an ex officio information for libel against the printer and publisher of the paper, who were tried and found guilty. At the Lancaster spring assizes in 1809 Joseph Hanson, a gentleman of property, was indicted before Le Blanc for a misdemeanour in abetting the weavers of Manchester in a conspiracy to raise their wages. Le Blanc summed up the case, and the jury found for the Crown. Le Blanc, however, reserved judgment, which was afterwards given by the court of king's bench, Hanson being sentenced to six months' imprisonment and a fine of ¬£100. At Stafford in 1812, he passed a death sentence on the forger William Booth. At York in 1813 Le Blanc opened, with Sir Alexander Thomson, a special commission for the trial of Luddites, under which some of the conspirators were condemned. His ruling in Rex v. Creevey (1 Maule and Selwyn, 273), decided the same year, to the effect that a Member of Parliament may be convicted for libel for circulating a newspaper report of a speech delivered in parliament, though the speech itself is privileged, became a leading authority on the law of libel. Death and legacy Le Blanc died unmarried on 15 April 1816 at his house in Bedford Square, and was praised by the reporters George Maule and William Selwyn, in recording the fact. He was buried in the church at Northaw, Hertfordshire, where a tablet was placed to his memory. His seat, Northaw House, passed by his will to his brothers, Charles and Francis Le Blanc. Le Blanc left some manuscript reports, which were incorporated by Henry Roscoe in the third and fourth volumes of Douglas's Reports, London, 1831.

He was the first Yakshagana artist to be awarded the Padma Shri Award by the Government of India. About Chittani Ramachandra Hegde is the first Yakshagana artist to win the prestigious Padmashri award before winning several awards in Karnataka. His style is so popular that it is called Chittani Gharana. He started his Yakshagana career when he was just 7 years old, after dropping out of School when he was still studying in II Standard. He started performing in main roles when he was just 14 years old and performed on stage until a few days preceding his death in October 2017. He hails from Uttara Kannada district and is popularly known as Chittani among his huge fan base. Life Chittani Ramachandra Hegde was born in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka. He practised badaguthittu style of Yakshagana. In spite of stiff resistance from family members, he started giving Yakshagana performances at the age of 15 and continued to act till age 83, a few days before his death. Yakshagana performances Chittani perfected the Yakshagana performance to such a level, where he is considered as \\"the finest example of what one could achieve in life with hard work and achievements. Chittani had performed yakshagana all over India and abroad. He used to perform on stage better than any younger artists.The ever lasting concrete experience on stage has enabled him to master even the most vigorous and tough character of the art, he added.He had even earned praise and appreciation from the legend of Kannada cinema the late Dr Rajkumar. Chittani and Yakshagana Chittani Ramachandra Hegde is one of the few names that Badaguthittu brings to mind. The Badagu style of Yakshagana is the coming together of dialogue, dance and acting. When all the three aspects are in the right proportion, the character that is portrayed comes out as required. This style of Yakshagana provides a great scope for the growth of the character portrayed. In fact Yakshagana is one art that provides a huge canvas for the characters to come to life. Probably no other art form offers that scope. As a result, the growth of the artiste means the growth of the character and hence the growth of the art itself. Wearing anklets on his feet and having dedicated more than six decades of his life to Yakshagana,Chittani was an artist of very high calibre. Chittani knew no world other than Yakshagana. Even at his ripe old age, not a single day was complete without Chittani tying anklets to his feet for the dance.Chittani was also known for his generous and encouraging attitude especially towards his fellow artists. Chittani grew up to the sounds of the Chande and Maddale. Yakshagana is very active through the year in North and South Canara and Shimoga district. Chittani, influenced by this environment since childhood, gave up his studies after class two and ever since has devoted all his time towards learning and perfecting the art of Yakshagana. Having learnt the intricacies of the art from a number of troupes and artistes like Shivarama Hegde and Kondadakuli Rama Hegde, Chittani soon rose to the level of playing the lead roles. Whichever troupe that Chittani became part of, had nothing to worry as all the shows ran to packed houses whenever Chittani performed. It would not amount to exaggeration if one were to say that Chittani was the only 'box office hero' in the history of Yakshagana. According to his fans, some of the characters portrayed by Chittani have actually been created by him. Bhasmasura-Mohini's Bhasmasura, Gadhayudda's Kaurava,Sudhanvarjuna's Arjuna as well as Sudhanva, Keechaka, Jarasandha, Karthaveeryarjuna, Dushtabuddhi,Maghagada,kamsa,kaladara,Rudrakopa among others, are characters which he mastered. He has grown with the characters he portrayed and the characters too have grown with him. Chittani was more of an entertaining artist. With his performances, he drew a fan following which included Kannada stars like Dr.Raj Kumar, Uday Kumar and Sreenath. Uday Kumar, who was known for his negative roles, would attend 'all-night' Yakshagana performances at the Town Hall in Bengaluru to study Chittani's expressions. Some of the expressions enacted by Yakshagana artists are known after Chittani. Mantapa Prabhakara Upadhya, Yakshagana artiste, described Chittani as a man who had taught him humility and the need to respect even the person who bought the cheapest ticket for a show. \\"He once told me that one should put on banna (make-up) as if it was one's last performance. That is the highest philosophy I have learnt from Chittani\\", said Upadhya. The kind of life that Chittani had breathed into the character of Bhasmasura while performing on stage was unparalleled. The portrayal of the character of Bhasmasura was extraordinary. Chittani's greatest plus points were his dancing and acting abilities, it is his presentation of anger, shringara or fear, that brings him to the forefront. His two sons,Subramanya Chittani and Narasimha Chittani, are already following in the footsteps of their father and pursuing the art. First Padmashri award for Yakshagana Chittani Ramachandra Hegde is the first artist performing Yakshagana, to receive prestigious Padmashri award and he dedicated the award to \\"Yakshagana\\".

He announced his candidacy on November 9, 2012, after long-term Governor Shintaro Ishihara suddenly resigned to return to national politics ahead of the then- looming next general election.The Japan Times Former head lawyer to run for Tokyo governor November 10, 2012 A field of nine candidates emerged, with the front-runner being Naoki Inose, who had been vice-governor under Ishihara from 2007 to 2012, and then acting governor after Ishihara's abrupt resignation. Inose vowed to follow Ishihara's policies. Utsunomiya stated that he wanted to improve support for the less fortunate of Tokyo by expanding employment opportunities and providing improved welfare and medical care. While other leading candidates wished to continue many Ishihara's policies and priorities, Utsunomiya harshly criticized Ishihara's administration, saying \\"Ishihara didn't care about enriching Tokyoites' lives. During Ishihara's tenure, the number of those who starved to death or went on welfare in the 23 wards doubled.\\" He was alone among the candidates who said that they would reconsider Tokyo's bid for the 2020 Olympics,The Japan Times Governor poll puts legacy of Ishihara to the test November 29, 2012 and criticized Ishihara's rash decisions such as his attempt to purchase the Senkaku Islands, which caused much friction between China and Japan.The Japan Times Tokyo gubernatorial election a three-horse race November 30, 2012 In addition, he said that he wanted to pressure the central government to abolish nuclear power, and also to do more to provide assistance for victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.

Football career Delamotte joined St. Mary's in 1888 and took over the role of secretary from George Muir who had guided the club since its foundation three years earlier. Delamotte generally played at outside-left and made his first cup appearance for the \\"Saints\\" in the Hampshire Junior Cup on 24 November 1888, scoring a goal in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Havant. Delamotte appeared in all seven matches (including the semi-final against Cowes which took four matches to decide) and scored in the final on 6 April 1889, a 3‚Äì0 victory over Christchurch. He had a reputation for charging the opposition goalkeeper and the supporters would cry out: \\"Go for him, Delly\\". He scored goals regularly and was ever-present in the club's runs to victory in the Hampshire Junior Cup in 1889‚Äì90 and in the Hampshire Senior Cup in 1890‚Äì91.

A Republican, he served two terms in the Washington House of Representatives. He represented the 5th district, which comprises the eastern third of King County. Magendanz was the ranking Republican on the House Education Committee and also serves on the House Appropriations and House Technology and Economic Development committees. He previously served as the Issaquah School Board President. Magendanz is endorsed by The Seattle Times newspaper in 2018.  Personal life  Magendanz enrolled in Cornell University in 1985 and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. After graduating, Magendanz served in the United States Navy until 1997 as a nuclear submarine officer and was honorably discharged as a lieutenant. Magendanz entered into a career of software development working for Microsoft, where he shipped 16 products and earned over 20 patent awards. Magendanz currently works as Director of Special Projects for Voter Science, LLC and teaches computer science in the Bellevue School District. He and his wife of 30 years, Galen, reside in Issaquah, WA and have two sons.  Political career  Magendanz was appointed a member of the Issaquah School Board in 2008, and elected to that position in 2009. He served as the School Board Legislative Representative from 2009‚Äì10 and was elected President from 2011-12. He resigned in 2013 after being elected to the state legislature. He was first sworn into the Washington State House of Representatives in 2013, representing the 5th district, a position he held until January 2017. In the House, Magendanz was the ranking minority member on the Education Committee. He also served on the Appropriations and Technology and Economic Development committees. Magendanz was appointed three times to education funding committees tasked with finding ways to provide high levels of educational achievement despite budget shortfalls. The committees were charged with examining staff compensation, the sources of school funding and collective bargaining agreements. In 2016, Magendanz opted to run for a seat in the Washington State Senate representing the 5th district. He wound up losing a close race to the incumbent, Mark Mullet, and has since returned to private life.  Major Legislative Accomplishments (2015 - 2016 Session)  During the 2016 legislative session, Magendanz was widely credited for helping to keep the state's charter schools open. Working with legislators from both parties Magendanz passed a new funding measure that drew upon the state's lottery fund to keep the eight charter schools in Washington open. Magendanz has sponsored and passed legislation alleviating teacher shortages, improving vision screening in schools, addressing truancy reform and providing consumer protection for retirement communities. Other significant legislative accomplishments include the Washington Cybercrime Act, a computer science education bill and a bill regulating electronic vehicle infrastructure. The Washington Cybercrime Act updates current statues to help prosecute crimes of electronic data interference, data theft, spoofing and tampering in the first and second degree. Magendanz also sponsored legislation establishing distance and near-vision testing for students in all Washington State school districts. House Bill 2573, which Magendanz co-sponsored, seeks to alleviate teacher shortages by helping with recruitment and retention and by removing barriers for out-of-state teachers to be certified in Washington. The legislation also expands scholarship opportunities for those pursuing a degree in education, and establishes alternative routes to teaching certification for experienced workers looking for a second career in education. The Cybersecurity Jobs Act was designed to help the private sector develop assets to protect industries and infrastructure from cyber attack. The legislation creates a process for detecting and responding to security incidents.  Pre-2015  In his time in the House of Representatives, Magendanz has focused on education, technology, and the interplay between the two. During the 2014 legislative session, Magendanz helped get Senate Bill 6552 passed through the House. The legislation created a 24-credit high school diploma to boost science, technology, engineering and math instruction. It also gave local school districts more flexibility in teaching this topic. That same session, Magendanz sponsored legislation that gave electric cars Washington state sales tax exemptions. Magendanz has also sponsored bills that created additional infrastructure for electric vehicles. The legislation offered financial incentives for utilities to build electric vehicle charging stations. Magendanz also has an interest in computer science education. He co-sponsored legislation that adopted statewide computer science teaching standards, expanded scholarship eligibility for educators interested in professional development in computer science, and directed the creation of a computer science endorsement for educators interested in teaching computer science.  Education task force  Magendanz has been appointed to three Washington state education task forces. The goal of these committees has been to increase funding for public schools in light of a Washington State Supreme Court ruling. In the McCleary Decision the court ruled Washington state funding for public schools was unfair and insufficient to adequately educate the state's youth. Specifically, the court identified teacher salaries as an area the legislature had consistently underfunded. In response to this, the governor set up a series of education task forces to examine school funding. Magendanz currently sits on the nine-member committee. The goal of the committee is to find ways to eliminate funding dependency on local levies by 2017. These levies are seen as an unstable funding source, potentially advantaging some school districts over others. Magendanz has spoken in favor of a revenue- neutral levy swap. This plan would raise no new taxes, but would rearrange existing funding in more sustainable and equitable ways.

The project is being developed by Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation and was officially launched in 2006. The official codename of the aircraft is Kunpeng (), after the mythical bird that can fly for thousands of miles described in the ancient Chinese Taoist classic Zhuangzi.Dave Sloggett, \\"THE DRAGON Gains its Strategic Wings\\" Air International, March 2013, pp. 94-95 However, within the Chinese aviation industry itself, the aircraft is more commonly known by its nickname Chubby Girl (), because its fuselage is much wider compared to other Chinese aircraft previously developed in China. Development Y-20 prototype at Airshow China 2014 The aircraft was primarily designed and developed in China under Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation. Certain parts of the wing such as the triple-slotted trailing-edge flaps were developed by the Ukrainian Antonov Design Bureau. Design Y-20 production model at Airshow China 2016 showing left side of the plane The Y-20 uses components made of composite materials. The composites are produced in China, whereas in the past they had to be imported. The Y-20's cabin incorporates flame-retardant composites developed by the 703 Institute of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The 703 Institute was created in March 2009 with development taking three years. The performance of the composites is reportedly comparable to those that fulfill FAR Part 25.835. The 703 Institute achieved another milestone by establishing a comprehensive Chinese evaluation and certification system for aircraft composite materials based on international standards. The Y-20 is the first cargo aircraft to use 3D printing technology to speed up its development and to lower its manufacturing cost. Model-based definition (MBD) is also used, and it's the third aircraft to utilize MBD technology in the world, after Airbus A380 (2000) and Boeing 787 (2005). A project team to implement MBD for the Y-20 program was formally formed in October 2009, and after the initial success in application on the main landing gear, MBD application was expanded to the entire aircraft and became mandatory for all contractors and sub contractors of the Y-20 program. The implementation of MBD was initially met with strong resistance, with only a third of suppliers agreeing to implement MBD. However, the general designer of Y-20 declared that those who refused to implement MBD will be banned from participating in the Y-20 program, thus forcing everyone to comply, resulting in increases in productivity. The implementation of MBD greatly shortened the time required, for example, without MBD, installation of wings takes a month or two, but with MBD adopted, the time is drastically shortened to just a few hours, and in general, the design work reduced by 40%, preparation for production reduced by 75%, and manufacturing cycle reduced by 30%. In addition to 3D printing, the Y-20 is also the first aircraft in China adopting associative design technology (ADT) in its development. Headed by the deputy general designer of structural design, Mr. Feng Jun (ÂÜØÂÜõ), the initial attempt to implement ADT actually failed after two months spent on application on the nose section. It was only after the second attempt that took another three months on the application on wings did ADT became successful. The adaptation of ADT greatly shortened the development time by at least eight months, and modification of wing design that previously took a week is shortened to half a day. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock. The Y-20 incorporates a shoulder wing, T-tail, rear cargo-loading assembly and heavy- duty retractable landing gear, consists of three rows, with a pair of wheels for each row, totaling six wheels for each side. The structural test was completed in 194 days as opposed to the 300 days originally planned, thanks to the successful development and application of an automated structural strength analysis system. In comparison, similar work for the Xian JH-7 took a year. According to the deputy general designer, the shortest take-off distance of the Y-20 is 600 to 700 meters. Y-20 incorporates a total of four LCD EFIS, and the development of EFIS for Y-20 utilizes virtual reality via helmet mounted display. Eight types of different relays used on Y-20 are developed by Guilin Aerospace Co., Ltd. a wholly own subsidiary of China Tri-River Aerospace Group Co., Ltd.(‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∏âÊ±üËà™Â§©ÈõÜÂõ¢), which is also known as the 9th Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC). It was reported that the Y-20 started ground testing in December 2012, including runway taxi tests. The aircraft made its maiden flight lasting one hour on January 26, 2013. During landing in first flight, it was reported that the Y-20 prototype bounced once before finally settling on runway due to high landing speed. In December 2013, a new Y-20 prototype took to the sky. On 6 February 2016 pictures of the fifth prototype (serial number 788) in flight appeared on Chinese military webpages. Other known prototypes carry identification numbers 781, 783 and 785. On 27 January 2016, former Chinese test pilot, Xu Yongling, had reported in a Xinhua article that Chinese aviation industry officials had stated that the Y-20 \\"had completed development\\" at the end of 2015. In June 2016, the first two Xian Y-20 aircraft were delivered to the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Propulsion The Y-20 is currently powered by four 12-ton thrust Soloviev D-30KP-2 engines, and all early production units are fitted with the same engine.http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/xian-y-20-heavy-military- transport-aircraft/ The Chinese intend to replace the D-30 with the 14-ton thrust WS-20, which is required for the Y-20 to achieve its maximum cargo capacity of 66 tons. The Shenyang WS-20 is derived from the core of the Shenyang WS-10A, an indigenous Chinese turbofan engine for fighter aircraft. In 2013, the Shenyang Engine Design and Research Institute was reportedly developing the SF-A, a 28700-pound thrust engine, for the Y-20 and the Comac C919. The SF-A is derived from the core of the WS-15. Compared to the WS-20, the SF-A is a conservative design that does not seek to match the technology of more modern engines. In late 2017, it was revealed that domestic Chinese turbofan WS-18 has begun flight tests on the Y-20. Compared with Russian Soloviev D-30, the WS-18 is 300 kg lighter, weighing in at 2000 kg; with thrust increased from 12.5 per ton of the D-30 to 13.2 per ton; and fuel consumption of the WS-18 is also reduced in comparison to the D-30, and the mean time between overhaul of the WS-18 is 3000 hours. However, because the increase in thrust is not significant in comparison to the D-30, the WS-18 is likely to be a stopgap measure before the WS-20 is ready. In February 2019, an internet photo revealed a Y-20 prototype with serial number 783 that was equipped with a single WS-20 for testing. Cargo capacity The estimated cargo capacity of the Y-20 in comparison to other military transport aircraft is listed below. The Y-20's capacious four-meter tall hold can lift up to 66 tons.  Variants  ;Y-20 :Base variant ;Y-20 aerial tanker :Aerial tanker variant under development. Planned to be able to carry about 90 tons of fuel, similar to the Il-78.https://asiatimes.com/2020/02/chinas-y-20-variants-make- rapid-progress-officer/ ;Y-20 AEW :Airborne early warning and control variant under development.https://asiatimes.com/2020/02/chinas-y-20-variants-make- rapid-progress-officer/ Operational history In 2014 the PLA National Defence University's Center for Economic Research recommended the purchase of up to 400 Y-20s, comparing the PLAAF's needs with the existing airlifter fleets of the United States and Russia. In June 2016 Jane's reported that up to 1,000 Y-20s are being requested by the Chinese military. On 6 July 2016 the first serial Y-20 (serial number 11051) was handed over to the PLAAF in a ceremony. The second aircraft numbered 11052 followed soon after - it was assigned to the 12th Regiment of the 4th Transport Division at Qionglai, Chengdu. On 8 May 2018, it was announced by PLAAF's spokesperson Shen Jinke that Y-20 had \\"recently conducted its first joint airdrop training with the country's airborne troops\\". Starting November 2018 there were rumors about an aerial refueling variant of the Y-20. It is very appreciated for PLAAF because the largest domestically-made aerial refueling aircraft is HY(Hong You, meaning \\"Bomber/Fuel Tanker\\")-6, whose capacity is limited. On 13 February 2020, the Y-20 was part of a fleet used to deliver supplies and personnel to Wuhan. The operation was part of an effort to mitigate what became the COVID-19 pandemic. A fleet of 11 aircraft was used to delivered 2,600 military medical staff to Wuhan. The PLAAF fleet of 11 aircraft consist of 6 Y-20s, 3 Il-76s and 2 Y-9s transport aircraft.

During his three terms, Matt Manweller was outspoken about controversial topics such as free speech on college campuses, bathroom bills, and the Washington Supreme Court.  Central Washington University Sex Investigation  He was initially investigated by CWU in 2012, the year he was first elected to the legislature, on claims of sexual harassment by students while teaching. He obtained a restraining order against the university to prevent release of the 2012 report; the order was lifted four days before election day. In both 2012 and 2013, outside investigators concluded that there was \\"evidence to suggest\\" that Manweller violated the university's sexual-harassment policies. While the university did not punish him following the 2012 investigation, in 2013 Manweller's promotion to full professor was delayed and he was ordered to complete sexual harassment training.

Farwell (died December 1940) was a footballer who played as a forward in the early years of Southampton St. Mary's, including making two appearances in the FA Cup. Football career Farwell joined St. Mary's in 1888 and remained with the club for five years. Described as \\"quick and full of tricks\\", many of his goals came at vital moments in important games. He had played in the earlier rounds of the Hampshire Junior Cup in 1888‚Äì89; in the semi-final against Cowes on 24 February 1889, the \\"Saints\\" were 1‚Äì0 down with two minutes to play when Farwell equalised with a \\"screw shot\\". Farwell appeared in all seven matches as the Saints eventually reached the final on 6 April 1889, a 3‚Äì0 victory over Christchurch. He scored goals regularly and was ever-present in the club's runs to victory in the Hampshire Junior Cup in 1889‚Äì90 (scoring in the final) and in the Hampshire Senior Cup in 1890‚Äì91. In 1891‚Äì92, he played (without scoring) in both qualifying rounds of the FA Cup, a 4‚Äì1 victory at Warmley and a 7‚Äì0 victory against Reading, although the latter match was awarded to Reading by the F.A. as St. Mary's had fielded two ineligible players. St. Mary's made up for their disappointment by winning the Hampshire Senior Cup for the second consecutive year, with Farwell scoring one of five goals in the final. Although he remained with the club until the summer of 1893, he was employed in the drapery department of the Edwin Jones store, thus making him unavailable for Saturday afternoon matches. Consequently, he did not play in that season's FA Cup matches, although he did play in all three Hampshire Senior Cup matches, including the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Freemantle in the final. Later career Following the introduction of professionalism in 1892‚Äì93, Farwell retired and became a draper in Havant. He maintained his contact with the St. Mary's area of Southampton as he was a member of the St. Mary's Church choir. He died in December 1940.

This name Brihadratha of a warrior king who was a Maharatha is found in the Rig Veda. The word, Brihadratha, means the Mighty Warrior. He appears at the beginning of the Maitri Upanishad after he had renounced his kingdom in favour of his son, seeking for himself relief from the endless cycle of birth and rebirth. No other information about him or his period is available in this text or in any other text. Maitri Upanishad belongs to the Maitrayaniya branch of Krishna Yajur Veda, which upanishad was taught to Sakayana by Maitri or Maitreya, the son of Mitra. Brihadratha chose the knowledge of the Self when he was offered a boon. He gave up his home and possessions and thereafter assisted by Sakayanya even renounced the ‚ÄúI-ness‚Äù of his body. Anti-Hedonism, evident in the Katha Upanishad in the refusal of Nachiketa to be seduced by the life of pleasure offered to him by Yama, degenerates into utter pessimism when Nachiketa tells Yama :: - what decaying mortal here below would delight in a life of the contemplation of the pleasures of beauty and love, when once he has come to taste of the kind of life enjoyed by the unageing immortals? (Katha Upanishad I.1.28). This pessimism surpasses all bounds in the lament of Brihadratha before Sage Sakayana, as he asks :: - What is the use of the satisfaction of desires in this foul-smelling and unsubstantial body which is a conglomeration of ordure, urine, wind, bile and phlegm, and which is spoiled by the content of bones, skin, sinews, marrow, flesh, semen, blood, mucus and tears? What is the use of the satisfaction of desires in this body which is afflicted by lust, anger, covetousness, fear, dejection, envy, separation from the desired, union with the undesirable, hunger, thirst, old age, death, disease and grief ? Verily all this world merely decays.look at the flies and the gnats, the grass and the trees, that are born merely to perish. But what of these ? The great oceans dry-up, the mountains crumble, the pole-star deviates from its place, the wind-cords are broken, the earth is submerged, and the very gods are dislocated from their positions and, he entreats the son of Sakayana, who appeared before him in the forest, to save him as one might save a frog from a waterless well. Sakayanya then taught Brihadratha how to suppress his own mind because only when the mind is suppressed does one see the brilliant Self glowing everywhere in all Its glory and by seeing whom one freed from own thoughts becomes selfless. In selflessness one attains absolute unity.

Farrell (born November 8, 1973) is an American activist and politician who served as a member of the Washington House of Representatives from 2013 to 2017. In the legislature, she focused on transportation, education, and labor issues. Farrell began her 2017 Seattle mayoral election campaign on May 12, 2017. and later lost in the August 1, 2017 primary.  Early life and education  Jessyn Farrell grew up in Seattle's Lake City neighborhood, and the adjacent city of Lake Forest Park. At Shorecrest High School, Farrell was voted \\"most likely to be a politician.\\" After graduating with a degree in history from the University of Washington, where she was the leader of the saxophone section in the Husky Marching Band, Farrell served as an AmeriCorps volunteer with the Youth Tutoring Program at Yesler Terrace. Farrell earned a Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School. As a summer intern, she worked for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, assisting in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes.  Career   Activism  Farrell is a longtime transit and environmental advocate. She started out as Transportation Advocate at the Washington Public Interest Research Group in Seattle, where she directed their efforts to reduce the health and environmental impacts of automobile emissions. From 2005 to 2008, Farrell served as the Executive Director of Transportation Choices Coalition (TCC), the leading nonprofit advocate for public transit in Washington. Under her leadership, the group led a coalition of transit and environmental organizations that successfully lobbied to redefine the state view of transportation capacity in a way that allowed more public funding to shift toward light rail and away from highways. Farrell and TCC also supported the passage of the 2008 ballot measure for Sound Transit 2, which funded light rail expansion north to Lynnwood, south to Federal Way, and east across Lake Washington. After her time at TCC, Farrell joined the executive team at Pierce Transit, where she helped oversee the response to the Great Recession. Pierce Transit subsequently won the 2012 Puget Sound Regional Council VISION 2040 Award.  Washington House of Representatives  In 2012, Farrell ran for Position 2 in the 46th Legislative District of the Washington State House of Representatives. She defeated five opponents in the primary election and won the general election with 64% of the vote. She was reelected in 2014, with 82% of the vote, and in 2016, when she ran unopposed. Farrell served on the Transportation (Vice Chair), Rules, and Commerce and Gaming committees in the State House. She was also the Chair of the Working Families Caucus. = Labor = In the State House, Farrell was part of the Democratic effort to raise the statewide minimum wage. She introduced minimum wage bills in 2014, 2015, and 2016, securing passage through the House in 2015, only for the bill to die in the Republican-controlled Senate. The Democratic campaign to raise the minimum wage across Washington culminated in the passage of Initiative 1433 at the ballot box in November 2016, which will gradually raise the minimum wage to $13.50 by 2020. In 2017, Farrell sponsored the Pregnant Workers' Fairness Act, which provides protections for pregnant women in Washington workplaces, such as more frequent restroom breaks, accessible drinking water, and flexible scheduling for doctors' visits. This was signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee on May 16, 2017. Farrell was also a strong proponent of the 2015 Equal Pay Opportunity Act, which passed the House, but not the Republican-controlled Senate. = Transit = Farrell is known for her work on improving transit, and campaigning to successfully pass Sound Transit 3 (ST3), though she also voted along with State House Democrats to remove some funding from ST3. In 2015, Farrell sponsored a bill that improves coordination between transit agencies in the Puget Sound region in order to provide better service, improve efficiency, save money, and institute accountability measures. As Vice Chair of the Transportation Committee, Farrell was one of the legislative leaders involved in negotiating the 2015 Connect Washington transportation package. This spending bill funds hundreds of projects across Washington over a 16-year period, including overhauling State Route 520 and improving I-405, while also authorizing the Sound Transit 3 ballot measure for expansions to light rail, bus, and commuter rail in the Puget Sound region. The $16.1 billion package was funded by an 11.9-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase and by authorizing state bonds. The bill included money for pedestrian and bike infrastructure, such as the Northgate Pedestrian Bridge and the Burke-Gilman Trail. The transportation package also supported affordable housing and education in the Puget Sound region. It required Sound Transit to contribute $20 million over five years to affordable housing and to give affordable housing developers the opportunity to bid on at least 80% of its surplus property. In addition, when Republicans earmarked $518 million in sales taxes from Sound Transit to go into the general fund, Farrell forced through an amendment that will require that money to be spent on educational programs for vulnerable students in the Sound Transit region. In 2017, in response to a controversy over the valuation schedule used by Sound Transit to determine the amount of Motor Vehicle Excise Tax (MVET), the House Democratic caucus voted to direct Sound Transit to use a newer valuation schedule that more accurately reflects cars' resale value and decreases taxes on many car owners in the Sound Transit area. Farrell supported this change, writing: \\"there's no way I'm asking my constituents to pay an MVET that's undergirded by an out of whack valuation schedule. When something is wrong, you fix it. Even if means taking some heat.\\" = Transportation safety = Transportation safety was a particular area of focus for Farrell. In 2015, she led the passage of the Oil Transportation Safety Act, which gives advance notice of oil shipments to first responders and requires greater public disclosure of oil transportation. In 2017, she was the lead sponsor of the Driving Under the Influence of Electronics Act, a bipartisan bill that prohibits dangerous behaviors such as texting or holding an electronic device while driving. Seattle mayoral election Farrell announced her entry into the race for Seattle mayor on May 12, 2017, one of several officeholders who joined the race shortly after Mayor Ed Murray announced he would not seek reelection. In a crowded field of 21 candidates ahead of the August 1 primary, Farrell was considered to be one of a half dozen relatively recognizable and viable candidates in the race, along with Jenny Durkan, Cary Moon, Nikkita Oliver, State Senator Bob Hasegawa, and former Mayor Mike McGinn.

Rivers had been appointed to complete Joe Zarelli's 2009‚Äì13 term as State Senator in the 18th District following Zarelli's retirement. Brandon Vick ultimately was elected as the state representative in the 18th District in Position 1 in the 2012 election, which Pike vacated due to her concurrent successful run for Position 2.  Personal background  Liz Pike was born on January 7, 1960, and raised on a Brush Prairie, Washington dairy farm as one of 13 children. She attended Battle Ground High School and graduated with honors. She also attended Clark College. She has two children.  Professional background  Pike has owned and operated Pike Advertising and triathlon/running event company. Her professional background includes serving as the political director with the Building Industry Association of Clark County, divisional board member of Umpqua Bank, and board member of her homeowner association.  Camas City government  In 2003, Pike ran successfully for a nonpartisan at-large position on the Camas City Council. In the primary, Pike, running under her then married surname of Erikson, finished first with 51 percent of the vote versus David Gast's 35.8 percent and Bruce Lindoff's 13.3 percent. In the General Election, Pike edged out Gast with 51.72 percent of the vote. In 2007, instead of running for reelection for the Camas City Council, Pike challenged the incumbent Camas mayor, Paul Dennis. During the summer, The Vancouver Voice courted controversy around the mayoral race after publishing a vitriolic letter from one of its readers that attacked the character of Pike. She responded by sending a letter of complaint from her attorney to the paper and the writer of the letter (who is unaffiliated with the paper's staff). In the General Election, Pike was defeated by Dennis, earning only 25 percent of the vote.  Washington State government  On January 23, 2012, Pike announced that she would be running for state representative in the 18th District in Position 2, vacated by Ed Orcutt who was redistricted into the 20th District. The 18th District's state senator, Joe Zarelli, announced minutes after the end of the candidate filing period on May 18, 2012, that he would not be seeking reelection. Zarelli notified Ann Rivers earlier in the day that he wouldn't be seeking reelection and invited her to run for his soon to be former senate seat. Likewise, minutes before the end of the filing period State Representative Paul Harris informed Brandon Vick that Rivers was going to run for Zarelli's senate seat and that he should run for Rivers' state representative seat. At the end of May, Zarelli announced that he would not only be not running for reelection, but retiring early. His resignation set off a chain of events, wherein Rivers was first appointed to complete Zarelli's senate term. Pike was appointed to complete Rivers' term as state representative. The Cowlitz and Clark county commissioners had selected Pike, despite Vick being the first choice of the district's Precinct Committee Officers. In the Primary Election, Pike faced Democrats David Shehorn, chair of the 18th District Democrats and retired computer systems engineer, and Ryan Gompertz, a 19-year-old history and economics major at the University of Washington. The results of the primary were Pike receiving the most votes with 61.3 percent of the vote, while Shehorn and Gomphertz received 30.1 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively. In the General Election, Pike received 60.46 percent of the vote to Shehorn's 39.54 percent. Pike's term as an appointed state representative for the 18th District in Position 1 ended on December 6, 2012.

They achieved recognition with Martin Port as CEO and was featured as a 2015 UK Government Future 50 Tech Company and in the Sunday Times Tech Track 100, a list of the fastest growing UK technology firms, in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2014. In April 2011 Masternaut merged with former AIM-listed competitor Cybit, and is operating under the Masternaut name. The company is owned by Summit Partners and Fleetcor, following its acquisition from Francisco Partners in 2014. Masternaut has around 400 employees, based in the UK and France. History Masternaut was founded in 1996 by Serge Deleau in France under the name SDM. In 2012, the company rebranded to Masternaut under Martin Hiscox with the backing of Francisco Partners. In 2013, Masternaut acquired Three X, a mobile workforce software business, from GE. Previously a Masternaut competitor, AIM-listed Cybit, led by CEO Richard Horsman, acquired Thales Telematics from Thales Group and public sector telematics specialist Amatics in 2007. Cybit made a further acquisition in 2008 of Truck24, a German Telematics Logistics provider, for ‚Ç¨4 million. In 2009, private equity firm Francisco Partners acquired Cybit Holdings plc in a ¬£23 million deal, taking the company private. Cybit also acquired Oxloc, a specialist non-powered asset tracking devices provider, that year. Meanwhile, Masternaut was on the acquisition trail, signing hosting and data store company Fibre-City for ¬£6 million. In 2011, Bill Henry as Chairman with the backing of Francisco Partners Private Equity merged Masternaut with Cybit in a ¬£100m deal to create Europe's largest telematics solutions provider, with a 10,000-strong customer base spread across 32 countries. However, Berg Insight reported that this position was lost in 2015 to Tom Tom as new business growth faltered. The Berg report for 2016 indicates Masternaut continues to lose market share to key competitors. Masternaut remains the largest telematics provider in the UK, and as part of the FleetCor family, is one of the largest fleet suppliers in the UK covering a fleet's total cost of ownership needs. Masternaut signed a partnership with Telefonica in 2012, estimated to be worth $910 million between 2012‚Äì2020. Masternaut also has partnerships with SwissCom and with many specialist fleet providers. In 2014, Masternaut Group Holdings was sold by Martin Hiscox then Chairman and Francisco Partners to Summit Partners and Fleetcor Technologies for an undisclosed sum. The company appointed Dhruv S. Parekh as CEO of Masternaut in 2015. Masternaut Connect, the next generation of the company's enterprise-grade SaaS platform, launched and grew at 25-30% per annum. Their product range expanded with a driver mobile application, a specialised cold chain solution and a plug-and-play telematics device. Partnerships for factory-fit telematics (Vauxhall, PSA, Renault) and for pre- equipped leased/hired vehicles (Fraikin, Petit Forestier, Lex) have improved overall access to telematics. As a result, surveys revealed an improvement of +50 in Masternaut's global NPS (Net Promoter Score) between 2017 and early 2019. In 2018, Masternaut underwent a company rebranding, including a new logo and a new proposition: the unseen advantage, emphasising Masternaut's supposed ability to \\"help companies leverage fleet data to optimise costs and transform business operations\\". The creation of a data science team, able to provide bespoke deep analysis from customer and global trends, was a key part of this transition. Michelin acquired Masternaut in 2019 making it their third major acquisition in fleet telematics. With the other acquisitions in North America and South America, Masternaut gives Michelin access to the European market. Technology Masternaut offer a range of telematics services incorporating a number of different technologies. All of these services use Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to track vehicle or asset locations, which are then transmitted via GPRS and GSM mobile networks to Masternaut's data centres and software platform, Masternaut Connect. Customers are able to instantly view their fleet's data.  CAN, OBD, and 12V cigarette lighter port  Masternaut are able to connect fleets in different ways (CAN bus, OBD port and cigarette lighter), that can be integrated as part of a mixed fleet service. Masternaut's patented CAN clip provides the most amount of real-time data and is less intrusive, whereas the OBD-II device is typically easier to install. The third option is a device that plugs into a vehicle's cigarette lighter (12V outlet), making it easy to plug/unplug and deliver obvious driver privacy.

At the same time, he began to work with Maria Curcio in London, receiving advice from such mentors as Leon Fleisher, Dmitri Bashkirov and above all Murray Perahia, who \\"has left a profound mark\\" on him.

Concept of Rudra in Sikhism Guru Granth Sahib covers the concept of Rudra Dhyaan. Every living being's surt/dhyaaan (or attention) can be directed in two ways, one towards one's body (outer world), and the other towards one's own self (source of attention). As long as our attention stays on our body only, and we loose connection with our self, we are incomplete (half or daal as in Gurbani). That is why we remain tense, confused and make wrong decisions. But those who are complete (The one as in Gurbani), their attention is focused on the source of attention itself (self) and thus, they are immune to any influence of outside world such as vices. Such a one-mindedness and focus is called Rudra Dhyaan. From such a dhyaan, the thoughts that sprout are all under divine hukam (and are not self- conceived). Consequently, Hukam itself is called Rudra. In Dasam Granth, Rudra and Shiva are generic terms while Mahadev is the name of one person, whom people call Rudra or Shiva. In Gurmat Philosophy, Mahadev was a Yogi who was dweller of Himalayas. In Hindu Myth, Mahadev is also called Shiv or Rudra but in Gurmat philosophy, Shiv term does not come for Mahadev, because Shiv is Nirankar (Formless). In Chopai, Guru Gobind Singh cleared it as: Mahadev ko kehat sada shiv, nirankar ka cheenat nahin bhiv.Line 392, Chopai Sahib, Guru Gobind Singh Guru Gobind Singh refers Mahadev/Shiva in following lines: References External links * dasamgranth.org - Read commencement and Dattatreya Avtar online * dasamgranth.org - Read Parasnath Avtar online * dasamgranth.in - with audio exogenesis Category:Dasam Granth Category:Sikh literature Category:Indian literature ","title":"Rudra Avtar"},{"id":"38015622","text":"''''' (Heart and mouth and deed and life), BWV 147.1, ',Work at Bach Digital website. is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed it in Weimar in 1716 for the fourth Sunday in Advent, 20 December. It is uncertain if the work was performed then. He later expanded the work in 1723 as Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147.  History and text  On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed primary responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the ' (palace church), on a monthly schedule. He likely wrote the work in 1716 for the fourth Sunday of Advent, although it may not have been performed at the time. The prescribed readings for the day were from the Epistle to the Philippians () and the Gospel of John (). The cantata uses a text by the court poet Salomo Franck, published in the cantata cycle Evangelische Sonn- und Fest-Tages-Andachten in 1717. Bach's superior Drese had died on 1 December that year, and Bach seemed eager to show his capabilities by composing cantatas for three Sundays in succession, including this cantata. When he realized that not he but Drese's son would succeed as Kapellmeister, he stopped working on them. He broke up the autograph score after the first movement, and would not compose another cantata for Weimar.  Scoring and structure  The work was scored for four solo voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) and a four-part choir. As the music is now lost, the cantata's instrumentation is unclear, but was likely similar to BWV 147. The piece has six movements: # Chorus: '''' # Aria: '''' # Aria: '''' # Aria: '''' # Aria: '''' # Chorale: '''' The opening chorus is elaborate, focused on the theme that the Christian is to be a witness of Jesus, as John the Baptist was, with all his being. The movement begins with an expanded instrumental concerto in which a trumpet fanfare is responded to by the strings. The ritornello is played with interwoven vocal parts and finally repeated as in the beginning. The first of four arias is for alto, possibly accompanied by an obbligato viola. Movement 3 is an aria for tenor and continuo. Movement 4 is an aria for soprano with an obbligato solo violin. Movement 5, a bass aria, alludes again to the Baptist who in turn referred to Isaiah. The voice is accompanied by an obbligato trumpet and strings, reminiscent of the opening movement. The final movement is a chorale of which Franck only submitted two lines. The continuation was found in a contemporary hymnal. When Bach expanded the cantata, he probably used the same opening movement, the first aria as movement 3, the second as movement 7, the third as movement 5, and the fourth with a new text as movement 9. The closing chorale was not used in the later work.

It should not be confused with the similarly named Waitakaruru River, which is also in the Waikato Region. The Waitakaruru Stream has its origin in the Te Miro-Tahuroa Hills south of Morrinsville, within the Waikato District. Initially the stream flows south and south-west through Scotsman's Valley before turning northwards at Tauwhare flowing roughly parallel to the Pakaroa Range as it passes the boundary of Eureka before entering the Matamata-Piako District. The stream passes through the settlement of Motumaoho, progressively turning a more easterly direction towards Morrinsville, where it has a walkway beside it and converges with the larger Piako River on southern outskirts of the town. The stream catchment is highly modified by agriculture, ranging from sheep, beef and dairy farming. Parts of the middle catchment are prone to minor flooding due to a natural constriction in the stream channel between Eureka and Motumaoho. The stream is part of the Eureka Drainage Scheme, managed by the Waikato Regional Council.http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environment/Environmental- information/REDI/911500/ The Waitakaruru Stream is notable in that it forms part of the catchment boundary between the Piako River catchment and the Waikato River catchment. The Piako River drains into the Firth of Thames, and ultimately the Pacific Ocean, while the Waikato River drains into the Tasman Sea. The bordering sub-catchment which feeds the Waikato River is the Mangaonua Stream. It also has a tributary named Waitakaruru Stream.

As a banking institution, BancoEstado is subject to the laws applicable to banks generally as well as those regulating the private sector as a whole, and thus is not governed by general laws and regulations aimed at the public sector. In 2005, BancoEstado was the first Chilean bank to open a branch in New York. This branch operates under the U.S. banking law.  Subsidiaries  The bank has several subsidiaries that complement its activities. Among these are the following:https://www.corporativo.bancoestado.cl/investor-relations/corporate- information/subsidiaries-and-afilliates * Stock and securities trading: BancoEstado Corredores de Bolsa S.A.

He composed the work in Leipzig for Michaelmas and first performed it on 29 September 1729.Man singet mit Freuden vom Sieg BWV 149; BC A 181 / Sacred cantata (Michaelmas (29 September)) Bach Digital It is the last of his three extant cantatas for the feast. Picander wrote the cantata's libretto, and published it in a 1728/29 cycle of cantata texts. The libretto opens with two verses from Psalm 118 and closes with the third stanza of Martin Schalling's \\"\\". The topic of the libretto aligns with the prescribed readings for the day from the Book of Revelation, Michael fighting the dragon. The closing Lutheran hymn stanza writes about a \\"sweet little angel\\", accompanying a soul in anticipation of the Last Judgment. The cantata has seven movements, and is scored festively with four vocal parts and a Baroque orchestra of three trumpets, timpani, three oboes, bassoon, strings and continuo. Bach derived the music of the opening chorus from his Hunting Cantata, composed already in 1713.  History and text  Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the feast of St. Michael (Michaelmas); it is his third and last of his extant cantatas for the feast, a feast celebrating the archangel and all angels. The prescribed readings for St. Michael's Day were from the Book of Revelation, Michael fighting the dragon (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, heaven belongs to the children and the angels see the face of God (). St. Michael, the archangel, has a prominent position in Lutheranism, as in Judaism. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted all of Bach's church cantatas in 2000 on the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, notes that the Sanctus, composed for Christmas 1724 in close relation to the text by Isaiah, and much later integrated to Bach's Mass in B minor, shows the relevance of angels for Bach's Lutheranism. The libretto was written by Christian Friedrich Henrici, better known as Picander, Bach began to work with him in 1725, and they collaborated notably on the major St Matthew Passion. Picander wrote his cantata texts, including this one, with Bach as the composer in mind. The poet included as the first movement two verses from a psalm () and as the closing chorale the third stanza of Martin Schalling's hymn \\"\\". The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that battle scenes were often depicted in art and music. In the opening lines taken from a psalm, the battle of Michael against Satan is already won. Satan is mentioned only in the first movement. A focus of the later sequence of alternating arias and recitatives is on guardian angels seen as \\"holy watchmen\\". The libretto was published in the 1728/29 year of his collection . They appeared in quarterly volumes to help the congregation following the text. Bach led the Thomanerchor in the first performance of the cantata in Leipzig on 29 September, either in 1728 or 1729.  Scoring and structure  Bach structured the cantata in seven movements and scored it for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four- part choir, and a Baroque orchestra of three trumpets (Tr), timpani (Ti), three oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), violas (Va), bassoon (Fg), violone (Vo), and basso continuo (Bc). The title of the autograph score reads simply: \\"J.N.J. Festo Michaelis. / Man singet mit Freuden etc. di I.S.Bach.\\" In the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach- Ausgabe. The time signature is provided using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. .  Music   1  Bach based the music of the opening chorus, \\"\\" (There are joyful songs of victory), on the final movement of his secular Hunting Cantata, which had been his first cantata using \\"modern\\" recitatives and arias in 1713. The polyphonic movement is described by Simon Crouch as being a \\"high-octane start\\". Gardiner notes that in comparison to earlier works for the same occasion, this movement is \\"festive rather than combative\\". Bach reworked the earlier movement considerably to adjust from the court music context to joyful songs of victory: he replaced two horns with three trumpets and timpani, transposed the music from F major to D major, and expanded it \\"on every level\\", as Hofmann notes. The beginning of a different setting of the text hints at the fact that the idea to use the early music as a base was not planned from the start.  2  The bass aria, \\"\\" (Power and strength be sung), is accompanied by two low instrumental melodies. It examines the conflict between God and Satan, and includes a very active continuo to represent \\"the fury of the battle\\". The imagery of a \\"great voice\\", as mentioned in the Book of Revelation, is used, announcing the Lamb \\"that has defeated and banished Satan\\".  3  A short alto recitative, \\"\\" (I don't fear thousand enemies), was described as \\"tonally unstable\\".  4  The soprano aria, \\"\\" (God's angels never yield), is lyrical and dancing. The string accompaniment uses parallel thirds and sixths. It is stylistically similar to a minuet, and is formally an adapted ternary structure.  5  The tenor recitative, \\"\\" (I thank You), ends with an ascending phrase meant to represent an appeal to heaven.  6  The duet aria for alto and tenor, \\"\\" (Be wakeful, you holy watchers), employs canon technique and a repeated interrupted cadence. Its introduction has been described as \\"the most athletic of bassoon lines\\". The tenor and alto voices repeat the opening bassoon figure in canon.  7  The work ends with a harmonically complex four-part setting of the chorale, \\"\\" (Ah, Lord, let Your dear little angel). It is a prayer to be sent an angel to carry the soul in Abraham's Bosom, and a promise to praise God eternally. Bach's setting is remarkable for its final two bars: the trumpets and timpani create a \\"magnificent blaze of sound\\". Bach chose the same stanza of Schalling's chorale to end his St John Passion, in the work's first and last version.  Publication  The cantata was first published in 1884 in the Bach- Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA).  Recordings  The table is excerpted from the listing on the Bach Cantatas Website.

History  An Eberhardus de Eckebretsteine was first mentioned in the records in a deed of gift by Duke Otto II of Merania in 1248. In 1308, King Henry VII of Germany enfeoffed the brothers Ulrich, Henry and Nickel, of the House of Sack, with the fortress of Epprechtstein; the Wilds were co-owners. In 1337 Emperor Louis the Bavarian enfeoffed Vogt Henry of Plauen with a small part of the castle. In 1352, the burgraves of Nuremberg stormed the robber baron castle and were given it as a fief. Amongst the attackers was Henry of Kotzau with his two brothers. In 1355/1356 they purchased the castle, the office and the parish of Kirchenlamitz outright, whereupon Epprechtstein and Kirchenlamitz became part of Sechs√§mterland (\\"Six District Land\\") and the seat of its officials, the Amtm√§nner. The castle tower was part of the defensive system of the \\"Wartordnung\\" of 1498. In the 16th century, the castle was destroyed by troops of Vogt Henry of Plauen and fell into ruin. The ruins were researched in the 18th century by local historian, Johann Theodor Benjamin Helfrecht, and cartographer, Johann Christoph Stierlein. The artist, Georg K√∂nitzer, sketched a lithograph of the ruins as part of his field of interest around the Fichtel Mountains (German: Fichtelgebirge).  Description  Hoher Stein The ruins of Epprechtstein Castle stand on the treeless summit on an elongated granite ledge the sides of which drop away steeply. The ruins comprise the old tower house on which a staircase leads to a viewing platform. From the lookout is an all-round view of the Waldstein ridge, to the Gro√üer Kornberg, to Schwarzenbach an der Saale and Oberkotzau as far as Hof, south over the interior Fichtel Mountains to K√∂sseine. 250 metres southeast is the service hut of the Kirchenlamitz mountain rescue organization.

He was the son of Martin Schalling the Elder. Life Schalling was born in Strasbourg in 1532. He studied in Wittenberg and became a magister in 1554. He moved to Regensburg as a deacon, but came into conflict with Nicolaus Gallus and moved on to Amberg. As Frederick III was seeking to introduce the Reformation to his lands with the assistance of Caspar Olevian, Schalling defied him and sought advice from Wittenberg. Schalling had to leave Amberg and next went to Vilseck. Only during the reign of Louis VI was he able to return to Amberg as a court preacher and superintendent. He worked at the 'Konkordienbem√ºhungen', backing his tutor Philipp Melanchthon, but later withdrew. In 1585 he was a pastor in Nuremberg and continued working for twenty years. Schalling died in Nuremberg in 1608. His best-known work as a hymn-writer is \\"Herzlich lieb hab ich dich, o Herr\\" (What hearty love I have for you, oh Lord, EG 397), which has been set by several composers, including Heinrich Sch√ºtz (in his Geistlichen Chormusik), Dietrich Buxtehude (cantata, BuxWV 41) and Johann Sebastian Bach (at the close of the St John Passion).

Early life Jewish-American, Tatar was born on January 23, 1930, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His interest in acting and entertainment began as a student at Schenley High School in Pittsburgh; he also began acting at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and the YM and WHA as a high school student. Tatar enlisted in the United States Army during the Korean War. After his discharge from the Army, he enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh where he received a bachelor's degree in drama and English. He also worked part-time at the Original Hot Dog Shop in Oakland, which was owned by his uncle. Following college, Tatar won a scholarship in 1955 to attend an acting-affiliate of the American Theatre Wing in New York City. The other scholarship student at that time was James Earl Jones. The prestige of the school and Ben's solid acting talent won him excellent working relationships with influential theatre folk, and his Pittsburgh connections, including director Henry Weinstein, brought him the social company of such luminaries as Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller. Career Tatar began his television career behind the scenes, first as a cue card holder for such shows as The Kate Smith Show and The Jimmie Rodgers Show. He also read and answered mail sent by fans to those shows and to The Honeymooners, starring Jackie Gleason. Working with Jackie Gleason as his personal assistant provided Ben with a working journey to Paris, traveling aboard the , to make the movie Gigot, directed by Gene Kelly. His additional film credits included The Thin Red Line, which was filmed in location in Spain and released in 1964; the 1965 film, Battle of the Bulge; and The Wind and the Lion in 1975. He was also in \\"Patton,\\" and worked as director of the English versions and as dialogue coach for films of Vicente Aranda, whose work included \\"The Blood-Spattered Bride\\" and \\"The Exquisite Cadaver,\\" during which he got to know actress Capucine and became companion to actress Judy Matheson. Tatar also worked with Telly Savalas. Tatar worked in Spain throughout the 1960s and 1970s, where he became a language voice dubbing director and voice-over artist for television and film production companies based in the Spain. His fluency in five languages ‚Äì English, French, German, Italian and Spanish ‚Äì aided him in the profession. Pittsburgh In 1981, Tatar moved back from New York City to his native Pittsburgh to care for his mother. He settled in Pittsburgh's Highland Park neighborhood, where he resided for more than thirty years. Away from the acting hubs in New York and Los Angeles, Tatar turned his professional attention to local theater, as well as film and television productions filmed on-location in the Pittsburgh area. Tatar's return to Pittsburgh benefited Pittsburgh cultural endeavors: he did much acting and directing and also voice-overs. He was a member of the JCC Theatre Club for many years. His later work included productions at the Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre and for the Jewish Theatre of Pittsburgh. He also appeared in numerous low-budget horror films produced in Pittsburgh. In 1995, Tatar co-starred in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie, The Piano Lesson, which was written by playwright, August Wilson, another Pittsburgh native. Personal life Tatar authored an unpublished autobiography titled, The Dream Never Dies, in which he wrote of his early career, his work with leading actors on various films, his relationship with Ava Gardner and his voice-over career in Spain. In addition to acting, Tatar created word searches and compiled crossword puzzles for the publishing firm Dell Publishing. Death Tatar died from chronic pulmonary disease at UPMC Shadyside in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on November 29, 2012 at the age of 82. Tatar, who never married, was buried at B'nai Israel Cemetery.

Along with Uddalaka, Prachinshala, Budila, Sarkarakshaya and Indradyumna, who respectively held earth, heaven, water, space and air to be the substrata of all things, and many others, Raikva was one of the leading Cosmological and Psychological philosophers of the Upanishads. He imparted the Samvarga Vidya to King Janasruti. Like Indradyumna he too held air to be substratum of all things. King Janasruti, the ruler of Mahavrisha, was famous for his philanthropy and charity who was proud of what he gave away as gifts and in charity. He had come to know about Raikva by chance from the swans, who already impressed by his deeds of charity, had seen him, and whose conversation he happened to overhear. He heard one swan tell the other ::-As the inferior ones get included in Krta (the face of the dice bearing the number, Four), when it becomes the winner, so all virtuous deeds performed by people get included in this one; any one else who knows what he, Raikva , knows, he is also like Raikva.(Chandogya Upanishad IV.1.3) Janasruti who was himself wise and learned was astonished at what he had heard and which was meant for him to be heard. He approached Raikva with gifts, and after being called a Sudra (Sudra means one who is tormented by cravings and therefore, by pain and suffering), he accosted Raikava again with even richer gifts and his beautiful daughter in offer. Raikva told Janasruti that air was the end of all things and so logically also the beginning of all things ::- when fire is extinguished it goes to the air, when the sun sets it goes to the air, when the moon sets it goes to the air, when the waters dry up, they go to the air; thus verily is Air the final absorbent of all things whatsoever.(Chandogya Upanishad IV.3.1-2) . He did not explain the actual process of absorption but Raikva was bold in including water and fire among the absorbed things, those two elements that had been held to be from where all things originated. With Prana considered by Ushasti Chakrayana as the life-principle Raikva brings out a correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm as the universal and in living things, as the final absorbent. Raikva was a mystic who knew about the relationship between the macrocosm and the microcosm and concluded that the two which are such, are surely the two places of merger ‚Äì air indeed in the case of gods, the vital force in the case of organ, that absorption is the important quality to be meditated upon as Air and Prana. Prana or Vayu are Brahman. Brahman is the also the substratum of ignorance but the effects of ignorance are seen only through created things such as the Jivas.

First a Franciscan, he joined the Bohemian Brethren. He published the most extensive early Protestant hymnal in 1531, supplying most hymn texts and some tunes himself. One of his hymns was used in Johann Sebastian Bach's St John Passion.  Career  Wei√üe was born in Nei√üe (now Nysa, Poland) and attended the Pfarrgymnasium (pastoral school) there.Rudolf Walter: Kirchen- und Schulmusik in der Bischofsstadt Neisse im 14./15. Jahrhundert. In: Die Anf√§nge des Schrifttums in Oberschlesien bis zum Fr√ºhhumanismus. ed. Gerhard Kosellek, Frankfurt 1997, , pp. 281‚Äì302. From 1504, he studied at the University of Cracow and became a Franciscan friar in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) in 1510. He and colleagues Johannes ZeisingVgl. Zeising, Johannes (d. 1528) - GAMEO (retrieved 22 July 2012). and Johann M√∂nch converted to the teaching of Martin Luther, and were expelled from Breslau around 1517. In 1518 they were admitted to the Bohemian Brethren. Wei√üe was elected as Prediger (preacher) and Vorsteher (leader) of the German community of brethren in Landskron in 1522. The same year he was sent as part of a delegation to Wittenberg, to compare the Brethren's creed with that of Martin Luther. From 1525, Wei√üe, Zeising and M√∂nch favoured and promoted the teaching of Ulrich Zwingli, which caused conflict with the bishop of Prague. While Wei√üe and M√∂nch submitted to the bishop, Zeising joined the Anabaptists and was burned in Br√ºnn in 1528 on a decree of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I. In 1531, Wei√üe was ordained as a priest of the Unity of the Brethren on a synod in Brandeis, and at the same time made Vorsteher of the German congregations in Landskron and Fulnek. He died in Landskron in 1534.  Works  Wei√üe wrote theological tracts and hymn lyrics, which he partially set to music himself. He published in 1531 the hymnal of the Brethren, Ein New Gesengbuchlein (A new little hymnal), in Jungbunzlau in 1531. The first hymnal of the Brethren in German contained 157 hymns, 137 written or adapted by Wei√üe, on melodies mostly from the Bohemian tradition of the Brethren. Then the most extensive Protestant hymnal, it influenced other collections. It was the first hymnal structured by topics, eight sections for times of the liturgical year, praise, prayer, teaching (\\"Leergeseng\\"), times of the day, children, penitence, funeral (\\"Zum begrebnis d Todte\\"), last judgement (\\"Vom j√ºngsten Tag\\"), saints (\\"Von den rechten heiligen\\") and testament (\\"Von dem Testament des herren\\"). One of Wei√üe's hymns was used in Johann Sebastian Bach's St John Passion. Part II and the third scene, of the court hearing, is opened by the first stanza of a hymn for Passiontide, \\"\\" (Christ, who hath us blessed made), summarizing what Jesus has to endure although innocent (\\"made captive, ... falsely indicted, and mocked and scorned and bespat\\"). The scene of the crucifixion ends with stanza 8 of this hymn, \\"\\" (O help, Christ, O Son of God). Seven of the eight stanzas of this hymn are also used in the mid-18th-century pasticcio Passion oratorio Wer ist der, so von Edom k√∂mmt (movements 2, 24, 27, 30, 38, 40 and 42).Text-, Liedvorlagen, Bibelkonkordanzen und Besetzungsangaben zu den geistlichen Kantaten, Oratorien & Passionen Johann Sebastian Bachs at Mauricio Kagel quoted the hymn, paraphrased to \\"Bach, der uns selig macht\\" in his oratorio Sankt-Bach-Passion telling Bach's life, composed for the tricentenary of Bach's birth in 1985. Eight hymns by Wei√üe are part of the current German Protestant hymnal ' (EG), including his Easter hymn \\"Gelobt sei Gott im h√∂chsten Thron\\". His hymnal was reprinted by Konrad Ameln in 1957 as a facsimile, titled Gesangbuch der B√∂hmischen Br√ºder 1531 (Hymnal of the Bohemien Brethren 1531).

Ndawa was born into slavery and was traded multiple times until the chief of Tikonko, Makavorary, began training Ndawa as a warrior. Ndawa gradually became a powerful war chief who derived his authority largely from his ability to plunder. He was most successful when he became aligned with the war chief Kai Londo. When Kai Londo and Ndawa disagreed about the division of plunder from their wars, it started the Kpove War which involved Ndawa attacking multiple communities in the region for much of the 1880s. In 1887, Ndawa and Makavorary attacked many British allies and the British organised a force to attack Ndawa. In a battle in 1888, Ndawa was killed after his Achilles tendon was cut. Early life Ndawa was born into slavery in the town of Manjoro (in present day Kailahun District, Sierra Leone) around 1850. He was trained partially in warfare early in life but was sold from his original master to another master, Sellu Tifa, after he was accused of having an affair with the wife of another man. He was sold again to the chief of Tikonko, Makavorary, who trained Ndawa as a warrior. War chief Ndawa gradually became a war chief, a chief who relied not on kinship or Poro (a social bond that granted authority in Mende culture) but instead on goods and slaves which could be captured in warfare. War chiefs would control some villages and towns but these would operate largely as a base of operations rather than an area they controlled because of their kinship connections. Although he operated as an independent military power that would support itself through mercenary activity or plunder, the connection between Makavorary and Ndawa remained strong. War chiefs would generally align their military with different traditional chiefs depending upon the profit (either through plunder or payment) that was available. Ndawa became an important war chief with 13 towns under his control and his headquarters in the town of Wende, largely through an alliance with Kai Londo (sometimes Kailundu), another war chief. Kai Londo and Ndawa joined forces in 1875 to defend the land of Makavorary from attacks by another chief named Benya from the town of Blama. They defeated Benya and took over a number of villages with one another, becoming quite famous in the process. Kpove War After their conquest, Ndawa and Kai Londo got into a dispute over the division of goods and slaves seized in their successful raids. Ndawa was insulted when Kai Londo accused him of cheating him and threatened to attack Kai Londo's base of Luawa. This dispute began the famous Kpove war which would last throughout most of the 1880s until Ndawa's death. The war got its name because in preparation for the battle between Ndawa and Kai Londo, Ndawa dug a large hole and filled it with dung and threatened to throw anyone who left the battle into the hole. The war thus acquired the name Kpove War meaning Dung Pot (kpovengue) War. In the first battle between the two, Kai Londo scaled the walls of Ndawa's compound in the early morning and caught Ndawa unprepared. Ndawa and Kai Londo engaged in lengthy hand-to-hand combat with each other in which both became injured. However, Kai Londo was able to win the fight and Ndawa agreed to retreat. A second battle quickly followed in which Ndawa's army was pushed to the other side of the Moa River and Kai Londo became the dominant force on his side of the river. The Kpove war continued with Ndawa fighting multiple times for the rest of the 1880s. The British tried many times to restrain Ndawa and arranged for Makavorary to prevent Ndawa from attacking sites important to them on many occasions, namely Bandasuma. In 1887, Makavoray and Ndawa joined forces in a general campaign against British interests. The regional warfare by Ndawa and Makavorary peaked in 1887 when they sacked the British base of Sulima, Sierra Leone and attacked a number of other communities. Later on 11 April 1887, Ndawa succeeded in sacking Bandasuma and taking Nyarroh, an important British allied chief, hostage. These attacks resulted in the British mounting an active offensive against him in 1888. The operation included an organised force of British officers and chieftains in the region to fight against Ndawa. In a battle near Dama in 1888, an anonymous soldier cut Ndawa's Achilles tendon and, according to oral tradition, he called over Jami Lenga, considered a great warrior, to finish him off so that he would not die from an unknown hand.

It is one of the few surviving pre-Mongol buildings in Russia. It contains the frescoes of the 12th century, extremely rare in Russia. The church is located within the Staraya Ladoga Fortress, on the left bank of the Volkhov River. The building was designated an architectural monument of federal significance (#4710025007). Ceiling fresco depicting Jesus with angels History Staraya Ladoga was the first seat of Rurik in 862, and, after Rurik moved the seat to Novgorod, remained in the Novgorod Lands. It controlled one of the most important waterways at the time, the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, of which the Volkhov River was a part. The stone construction in Staraya Ladoga started either in 1114 or 1116, and in the second half of the 12th century seven or eight stone churches were built, of which only two have survived to our days. The exact year of construction of St. George's Church is unknown, but the details of architecture and painting show that it was built between 1180 and 1200. It was first mentioned only in 1445. The church was rebuilt in the end of the 16th century, but only the exterior was slightly altered. By the end of the 17th century, the interior of the church badly needed to be renovated, and the renovation was made in 1683-1684. During this renovation, new windows were made, and many of the frescoes from the walls were lost. The restorations were also carried out in 1902, 1925-1928, 1952-1962, and in the 1970s - 1990s. Architecture The architecture of the church is typical for Novgorod. The church is based on four pillars and has one dome and three apses. The church is small (the area of the floor is and slightly asymmetric with respect to the north-south direction). This is explained by the fact that the church was built inside an existing fortress, and the space was quite limited. Painting Frescoes were painted in the same year as the church was opened. This is one of the few examples of the 12th-century frescoes in Russia. In 1445, some of the frescoes were renovated, with the emphasis on the careful reproduction of the old ones. Most of the original frescoes were lost in the 17th century. Some of them were removed from the walls and left under the new floor. These were discovered in the 20th century and restored. In 1780, some of the old frescoes were discovered on the walls. In total, about 20% of the original frescoes survived. The whole original painting can not be reconstructed, however, it is clear that the northern and the southern walls had five rows of images each. Nothing survived from the frescoes of the western and the eastern walls. The frescoes of the dome were almost left intact. They depict the Ascension of Jesus. Below, the Apostles and the Prophets are painted. All frescoes were made in the same style. Most likely, they were made by a group of painters, two of whom were the principal ones. Sky blue, red, and yellow colours dominate. There are also some colour variations, including the usage of white colour, which are not typical for Eastern Orthodox frescoes of the time and only have some parallels with the Byzantine painting, which gives a hint that the painters were Greek.

Background Following its experiment during and after the Russo-Japanese War with modified versions of the Holland- class vessels designed in the United States, the Imperial Japanese Navy turned to the United Kingdom, which had continued development of the Holland design with 13 vessels in its A-class, 11 vessels in its B-class and 38 vessels in its C-class. The Japanese government contracted Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness for two vessels, which were laid down just after towards the end of the C-class production run for the Royal Navy. The completed vessels were shipped to Japan on a specially modified cargo vessel. With limited endurance and only a ten percent reserve of buoyancy over their surface displacement, The Ha-1 class were poor surface vessels, but their spindle shaped hull made for good underwater performance compared to their contemporaries. They also had three times the displacement of their predecessors in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and were the first submarines considered usable as combat vessels by the Japanese. Design and description The British C-class submarines were similar in design to the preceding B class and were intended for coastal patrol work and harbor defense. They had a petrol engine for surface propulsion and batteries for underwater propulsion. The design was intended to overcome the limitations of speed, endurance and seakeeping that had affected earlier Holland-type submarines, such as the Type 1 and Type 6 submarines in Japanese service, and were substantially larger. Their additional size increased their buoyancy and made them far less liable to unexpectedly plunge beneath the surface in bad weather. The addition of a deck casing above the hull also improved their seakeeping abilities.Akermann, pp. 120, 123‚Äì24 The design lacked any internal bulkheads which exposed the crew to the petrol engine's exhaust fumes. Mice were used to detect any concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the hull.Wilson, pp. 40, 44 Ventilation was provided for the batteries, but none for the crew's living area. No accommodations were provided for the crew and they were forced to improvise while at sea.Wilson, p. 44 In recognition of this issue, the crew's endurance was only expected to be four days during the summer and three days during the winter.Akermann, p. 124 Propulsion The C-class submarines had a single 16-cylinder petrol engine that had a designed output of and drove a single propeller. This engine was developed by Vickers from the Wolseley engine used in the A-class. Armament The Ha-1-class boats were armed with a pair of 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes side-by-side in the bow and angled slightly downwards. Space was provided for a pair of reloads.Wilson, p. 43 Ships in class *, laid down 3 August 1907; launched 19 May 1908; commissioned 26 February 1909 as Submersible No.8; reclassified as 2nd class submersible on 4 August 1916, reclassified as 3rd class submarine on 1 April 1919; renamed Ha-1 on 15 June 1923, decommissioned on 1 April 1924.Nishida, Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy *, laid down 3 August 1907; launched 19 May 1908; commissioned 9 March 1909 as Submersible No.9; reclassified as 2nd class submersible on 4 August 1916, reclassified as 3rd class submarine on 1 April 1919; renamed Ha-2 on 15 June 1923; decommissioned on 1 April 1924.

His opera libretto ' (\\"St. Eugenia, or the conversion of Alexandria to Christianity\\"), was set by Johann Philipp F√∂rtsch, premiered in 1688 and printed in 1695. Around 1700, Postel wrote the libretto for an oratorio ' (Passion and death of Jesus Christ, or St John Passion). A setting formerly attributed to George Frideric Handel is now believed to be by Christian Ritter. Another setting, called Das Lied des Lammes (\\"The Song of the Lamb\\") is by Johann Mattheson.

While Postel is thought to have written all thirteen poetic pieces added to the Gospel text, it is certain only for three which were reprinted by Christian Friedrich Hunold, while \\"\\" is among the other ten.

There, he also served as an imam to \\"Afghan\\" immigrants at their \\"Ghantown\\", leading daily prayers, and was the spiritual head of the group of \\"Afghan\\" cameleers. In charge of the killing of animals according to the principles of halal for consumption by Muslims, he was prosecuted twice for his allegedly unsanitary means of killing the animals, and for not joining the local Butchers' Union. This caused Abdullah to bear great ill-feeling towards the Union, as well as the local sanitary inspector, Brosnan, who prosecuted him. Another camel-driver and Abdullah's next-door neighbour, Gool Badsha Mahomed, was an Afridi tribesman from Afghanistan, and had fought in the Turkish Army. After the start of World War I, his religious and nationalistic fervour increased as he became infuriated by the conflict. Mullah Abdullah and Gool formed an alliance and plotted a mass shooting, to take place on 1 January 1915 in the Battle of Broken Hill.

Plot Sakamichi Onoda is an otaku who has just entered high school. In middle school, Onoda did not have any friends with whom he could talk about his interests, and hopes to change that by joining his new school's anime club. However, he is crushed when he discovers the anime club has been disbanded due to lack of interest, and in order to reestablish the club, four new members must join. Since he was a little boy, Onoda has ridden his city bicycle (referred to as a \\"mamachari\\", meaning \\"Mommy Bike\\", in the anime)‚Äîa simple and bulky bicycle designed for short rides‚Äîfor transportation and fun. A fellow freshman, and much more serious cyclist, named Shunsuke Imaizumi notices Onoda riding his mamachari and mocks him inwardly until he sees Onoda riding up a steep hill with little effort. Another student named Naruko visits Akihabara to get some plastic Gundam models for his younger brothers and meets Onoda, who catches his attention because of his cycling skill on the mamachari. Later on, both Naruko and Imaizumi try to convince him to join the bicycle racing club at their high school, Sohoku. Teams and characters Sohoku High School Sohoku is a hard-working team that acts as the main school in the story. The team is characterized as being able to overcome internal conflicts and brutal training. For example, Sohoku hosts an intense and gruelling 1000 km training camp every year to determine who will advance to the main race of the series, the Inter-High. ; : :Live action actor: Yuuki Ogoe (TV Series), Ren Nagase (Movie) :Onoda is the main protagonist of the series, a first-year high school student, and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. His personality is initially characterized as being a shy otaku with a difficulty in speaking up for himself. However, after joining the bicycle club, his confidence receives a dramatic boost, and the love and admiration he has for his fellow teammates becomes apparent. Since the very beginning of the series, Onoda shows steady stamina and high cadence abilities when riding uphill, and thus, the captain of the team, Kinjou, makes Onoda one of the team‚Äôs climbers. To nurture Onoda‚Äôs ability to climb for long periods of time, Kinjou assigns Makishima, a fellow climber and third-year, to tutor him. Onoda‚Äôs best cycling ability, the team finds out, is that he performs best when chasing someone in the lead. When Onoda enters the Inter-High, he performs amazing feats for his team such as passing more than 100 cyclists after a crash and drafting Tadokoro, who was recovering from stomach pain, for almost 70km from the back of the race to the front where the rest of the team is. ; : :Live action actor: Tatsunari Kimura (TV Series), Kentaro Ito (Movie) :Imaizumi is a popular first-year high school student and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Imaizumi is a logical thinker with a generally dry personality, although, when entangled in certain situations, he can become quite frenzied and passionate. Because he dreams of one day becoming the fastest cyclist in the world, his cycling style is defined as an all-rounder. Because of Imaizumi‚Äôs customarily coarse personality, his relationship with his teammates varies from person to person. For example, he has an intense rivalry with fellow teammate Naruko because of his sprinting abilities and overall attitude, likewise, he sees the captain, Kinjou, as his biggest obstacle. On the other hand, Imaizumi is seen being fairly gentle and kind towards Onoda. ; : :Live action actor: Taiga Fukuzawa :Naruko is a first-year high school student from Osaka, and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Naruko‚Äôs personality is sharp, spunky, and highly competitive, however, he takes cycling very seriously, and often gets very upset if he is defeated in a race, even if it is by another teammate. He is a high-energy sprinter, and his vitality often gets fueled by his mentor, Tadokoro, a fellow sprinter and third-year, who he affectionately refers to as ‚Äúold man.‚Äù He maintains a friendly rivalry with Imaizumi, and is always supportive and caring towards Onoda. ; : :Live action actor: Naoya Goumoto :Kinjou is a sunglasses-wielding third-year high school student and captain of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. He is an all-rounder cyclist with an amazing iron will in addition to being Sohoku‚Äôs ace. Kinjou comes off as having an icy personality, but throughout the series, he continuously shows that he has the best intentions for his team at heart. Kinjou works incredibly hard to bring out the best in everyone‚Äôs cycling abilities, especially Imaizumi, who he considers his mentee. ; : :Live action actor: Ry≈çma Baba :Makishima is a third-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Team. Makishima is the ace climber of the team and has the nickname of ‚ÄúPeak Spider‚Äù due to his unusual dancing technique when cycling uphill. His generally awkward personality, in addition to his strange looks, makes Makishima seem unapproachable or even frightening. However, throughout the series, he offers wise advice to his mentee, Onoda, about cycling. Makishima is also well known for having a longtime, intimate rivalry with Hakone‚Äôs ace climber, Toudou. ; : :Live action actor: Y≈´ki Tomotsune :Tadokoro is a third-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Team.

He has an outgoing, cheerful, yet serious personality that never fails to keep the other members in high spirits. Teshima is most noted for having a very close relationship with Aoyagi, a fellow second-year. He is often seen ‚Äúreading Aoyagi‚Äôs mind,‚Äù and knowing how Aoyagi is feeling or what he wants without him having to speak or show facial expressions. ; : :Live action actor: Ry≈ç Yashima :Aoyagi is a second-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club.

However, his actual skills are very slim, and he does not even fall into an all-rounder, climber, or sprinter category. His lack of skill becomes even more apparent when he fails to complete the 1000 km training camp because he refused to cycle in the rain. In the case of Onoda, Sugimoto's advice is given not out of ego but a genuine desire to be helpful. With Onoda being very new to the sport, Sugimoto's explanations of the basics greatly benefited him, for which he remains grateful for. ; : ; : ; : :Sugimoto Sadatoki is Terufumi Sugimoto Younger Brother and is a first-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. ; : ; : Hakone Academy Hakone Academy is the country's largest cycling team, and claims to be made up of ‚Äúsix aces‚Äù with many more in reserve. During the first year of the series, it was noted to have 50 club members. Since Hakone is such an expansive team, the selection process of who does, and does not, go to the Inter-High is quite complex. To determine who has the honor of participating in the Inter-High, all of the members race against each other, and only the winners of each group (A - F), are allowed to participate. Furthermore, these groups are divided so that the team takes three all-rounders, two climbers, and up to two sprinters to the Inter-High. ; : :Live action actor: Keisuke Ueda :Manami is a first-year high school student and a member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Manami is very easy-going and easily distracted by nature, cycling, and the feeling of complete freedom. He is the mentee climber to third-year, Toudou, and serves as Hakone‚Äôs second climber during the Inter- High. Though for different reasons, Onoda and he have a similar joy for climbing hills and the two hit it off almost immediately as friends and competitors. His most notable feature is that people hallucinate seeing wings on his back when he reaches his top speeds during a race. He accomplishes this by reading the wind conditions, then shifts upwards and dances when gusts come up from behind. His skill allowed him to win his club heats and join the Inter-High team, the first first-year to do so in the club's history. ; : :Live action actor: Ryo Kitamura :Toudou is a popular third-year student and a member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Toudou is the ace climber of Hakone, and mentor to first-year, Manami. His climbing style is fast and silent, and combined with his good looks, gives him the nickname ‚ÄúSleeping Beauty,‚Äù as he manages to sneak up on cyclists in front of him and pass them without their knowledge. His personality is very pompous, and he thinks very highly of himself. Toudou has many female fans who tend to inflate his ego, however, his strong relationship with Sohoku‚Äôs ace climber, Makishima, who he affectionately calls ‚ÄúMaki-chan,‚Äù tends to mellow him out again. Toudou is most often noted for his very intimate rivalry with Makishima. ; : : Live action actor: Eiji Takigawa :Fukutomi is a third-year high school student and captain of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Fukutomi is an all-rounder and ace of the team. His serious, straightforward personality and unchanging expression has earned him the nickname ‚ÄúIron Mask.‚Äù In addition to being remembered as the ace of Hakone, he is known for getting distraught during a past race and injuring himself and Sohoku‚Äôs Kinjou, with whom he has had a longtime rivalry. This makes him resolve to win against Sohoku in this years match, hoping it will be atonement for what he did. Throughout the Inter-High, he is often seen sporting his catchphrase, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm strong.‚Äù ; : :Live action actor: Shuto Miyazaki :Shinkai is a third-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Shinkai is the team‚Äôs ace sprinter, and claims to have a ‚Äúmonster locked up inside of him‚Äù that gets ‚Äúreleased‚Äù during especially stressful races. Shinkai‚Äôs personality is usually relaxed and easy- going, and he is often seen with a power bar in his mouth and striking his signature ‚Äúbakyun!‚Äù pose. In a past race, Shinkai ran over and killed a mother rabbit, leaving an orphaned kit who he then adopted. Because of his guilt, Shinkai stopped cycling for his team transiently, and became unable to pass other riders during races on the left side since that was what happened when he killed the rabbit. Although he is the ace sprinter, it was decided it would be best for him to not participate in the first sprinters race (first check point) during day one of the Inter high race and have Izumida represent their team during that day. Later he would race against Midousuji during the second one on the second day. ; : :Live action actor: Hiroki Suzuki :Arakita is a third-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Arakita is a skilled, albeit reckless, all-rounder cycler who was introduced to cycling in high school by Fukutomi; he had never ridden one previously, instead racing around on a scooter. He had originally chosen to attend Hakone Gakuen because it did not have a baseball club; an elbow injury prevented him from playing. His personality is described as wolf-like, and he generally seems very unapproachable. However, since joining the bicycle club, he has formed a strong bond with Fukutomi, and affectionately calls him ‚ÄúFuku-chan.‚Äù During the race, he pairs up with Onoda and Manami to get out of a pinch, and from then on starts calling Onoda \\"Onoda-chan\\", seemingly since he gets fond of Onoda's honest personality and pure desire to catch up. ; : :Live action actor: Soramu Aoki :Izumida is a second-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Izumida is the team‚Äôs second year sprinter who often receives ‚Äúwarnings‚Äù about dangerous situations during races from his pecs, Andy and Frank (named after the famous pro bicycle racers from Luxembourg, brothers Andy Schleck and Fr√§nk Schleck.) In the 2017 season, he starts calling upon his upper dorsal muscle, that he's called Fabian (after pro Swiss bicycle racer Fabian Cancellara.) He is quite vain and cares a lot about his appearance, which becomes obvious as he is seen throughout the series doing a tough workout routine. When racing, Izumida usually rides without holding his handlebars, and only zips up his jersey when he gets serious. When producing an effort, he chants \\"Abs, abs, abs, abs...!\\", a call of support to his chiseled abs. He greatly admires the teams ace sprinter, Hayato Shinkai. ; : : Live action actor: Ry≈´tar≈ç Akimoto :Kuroda is a second- year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. In the race to see who competed in the Inter-High, he loses to first-year, and fellow climber, Manami. In season 3, when he became a third year, he became the second climber along with Manami as Arakita, Fukutomi, Toudou, and Shinkai graduated. Kyoto Fushimi High School Kyoto Fushimi, or Kyofushi, acts as the third squad in this series and is the wild card of the main three teams. The team has a history as a strong team, where 1st year cyclists would go to become stronger. Its training practices are unknown, but other teams say they were a lot nicer in previous years before Midousuji joined the team. ; : : Live action actor: Mitsu Murata :Midousuji is a first-year high school student and member of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club. Midousuji is an all-rounder, and he is the newfound ace of the team. He is the best climber against all all- rounders in the team. His ruthless personality, paired with his ever-smiling face and habit of calling everything and everyone \\"gross,\\" gives Midousuji an unapproachable and unsettling atmosphere. He's known by other teams for his tactical expertise, and plans out the events of a race in great detail while taking into account for nearly every possibility. He aims for international acclaim as the fastest cyclist, and will stop at nothing in the pursuit of victory. Midousuji is known for having a rivalry with Sohoku's Shunsuke Imaizumi. In the next year, he relinquished his role as Ace, and became Ace Assistant to Mizuta. : ; : :Ishigaki is a third-year high school student and captain of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club. Ishigaki is an all-rounder and, before Midousuji joined the team, was the ace. With his position as ace taken from him, he becomes Midousuji's assist. Though he initially dislikes Midousuji, he comes to understand him better over the duration of the 41st Inter-high and aims to do anything he can to see Midousuji grow as a person and win. ; : :Mizuta is a second-year high school student and member of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club. He is an all-rounder. Mizuta is very easily influenced by those who he admires. Before Midousuji joined the team, he greatly admired Ishigaki and styled his hair just like his. However, once Midousuji joined the team, Mizuta began to admire him for his cycling strength and attempts to imitate Midousuji, getting braces to straighten out his teeth and even imitating some of his odd quirks. Mizuta seeks recognition from those he admires and will do whatever he can to obtain it. ; : :Ihara is a third- year high school student and member of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club. Ihara is one of the team's sprinters and is a friend of Ishigaki's. He was quick to reject Midousuji as the team's ace and even rallied against it, only to fall into place for the sake of his team. ; : :Yamaguchi is a second-year high school student and member of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club. Yamaguchi is a sprinter and avoids conflict within his team, giving him a quiet, passive demeanor. ; : :Tsuji is a third-year high school student and member of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club. Tsuji is a climber with a stoic demeanor and serious expression, and tries to avoid conflict within his team. Hiroshima Kureminami Technical High School Hiroshima is known to have no all- rounders, and 3 sprinters. ; : :Eikichi is a third-year high school student and member of the Kureminami Bicycle Club. Eikichi cycling style is sprinting, and he also serves as the ace for his team. He is well known for having a rivalry with the entirety of Hakone, as well as having the nickname ‚ÄúThe Fighting Dog of Kure.‚Äù He manipulated the pack full of sprinter on day 3 to get back to the pack, but when Hiroshima broke away, they left out of steam in the mountain sections and completely dropped out. Supporting characters ; : : Live action actor: Y≈´ya Asato :Touji is the eldest sibling of the Kanzakis and is the former captain of Sohoku. During his cycling career he was a sprinter, although he currently runs his family‚Äôs bicycle shop and supports the current members of Sohoku. ; : : Live action actor: Minami Sakurai (TV Series), Kanna Hashimoto (Movie) :Miki is a first-year high school student at Sohoku as well as the younger sibling to Touji. The family business resulted in her being passionate about bicycles and extensive knowledge about road racing, even though she's not a racer herself. She works in the shop as another mechanic on her off hours.

Patti is known for having worked closely with the Vi·ªát Minh and H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, leader of the Vietnamese independence movement and future president of North Vietnam.  Early life  Patti was born in the Bronx, New York City on July 21, 1913, to Sicilian immigrants. His father worked as a tailor and his mother was a dress maker. He was married to Margaret Telford. They had two daughters.  Career  The 1940 U.S. census lists Archimedes' profession as \\"Special Agent, U.S. War Department\\" and in 1941 he joined the U.S. Army and served in Europe. In Europe he was in contact with various anti-Axis resistance organizations including groups in North Africa, Italy, and Yugoslavia. He was later transferred to the Office of Strategic Services in China, after unknowingly volunteering for the mission in January 1944 while on assignment at Anzio with William J. Donovan, the Director of the OSS.  Indochina and Vietnam  During his career in China and Southeast Asia, Patti met H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, the leader of the Vi·ªát Minh and future leader and national hero of North Vietnam. In later interviews Patti explained that his mission in Vietnam was to establish an intelligence network but not to assist the French in any way as they attempted to re-gain control over their former colony, a policy choice he believed to be linked to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's belief in the self-determination of all peoples. Archimedes, did, from a distance, help organize, train and equip the fledgling Vietnamese forces Ho was uniting and marshaling against the Japanese, which in the future would be known as the People's Army of Vietnam, and worked closely with Ho Chi Minh and, indeed, commented on his early drafts of a Vietnamese constitution. Patti stated that when he arrived in Kunming in March 1945, the French colonials were either unwilling or unable to assist him in establishing an American intelligence network in Indochina and he therefore turned to \\"the only source [available]\\", the Vi·ªát Minh. Patti was introduced to Ho Chi Minh by Colonel Austin Glass, the OSS expert in Indochina. Patti met Ho Chi Minh on the Indochina-China border at the end of April 1945, and he agreed to provide intelligence to the allies provided that he could have \\"a line of communication with the allies.\\" Patti later helped coordinate some small attacks against the Japanese Imperial Army using a small group of operatives known as the OSS Deer Team under the command of Major Allison K. Thomas, who worked directly with Ho Chi Minh during the August, 1945.\\"Ho, Giap and OSS Agent Henry Prunier\\", By Claude G. Berube, Originally published by Vietnam magazine. Published Online: May 24, 2011 On August 22, 1945, Patti arrived in Hanoi on a mercy mission with OSS agent Carleton B. Swift, and a French government official, Jean Sainteny. His mission primarily was to assist in the repatriation of allied prisoners of war as the U.S. government feared reprisals against them by the Japanese following the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and, secondly, to gather intelligence. Patti met with Ho Chi Minh on August 26, 1945, over lunch at his residence in Hanoi and several days later Ho Chi Minh read a draft of the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence to him and Patti offered several corrections on what he perceived to be a near exact copy of the American Declaration of Independence. Indeed, Ho Chi Minh had requested an actual copy of the American Declaration of Independence from Col Austin Glass. Soon afterwards, on September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh declared independence and some hours later Patti had dinner with him. In the fall of 1945 French Colonial forces had returned to Indochina on U.S. manned Liberty ships. Patti left Hanoi at the end of September 1945, following French allegations that the Americans had been fomenting a revolution there.  Later life and death  Patti retired from the military in 1957. For 13 years, he was a crisis management specialist in the Office of Emergency Planning in Washington, D.C. In 1981, Patti stated that Julia Child, who had worked at the OSS during 1945, had allegedly submitted his position papers on Vietnam to appropriate authorities, but that the way in which he had found them upon retirement was exactly as she had sent them and that they had never been opened or read. In retirement, he wrote a book and several articles on Vietnam. In 1980, he wrote \\"Why Vietnam?: Prelude to America's Albatross,\\" which describes his relationship with Communist guerrilla leader Ho Chi Minh during the mid-1940s. He died on April 23, 1998, at the age of 84. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Gen. William Sherman's Army crossed the Savannah River during the beginning of General Sherman's \\"Carolina's Campaign\\" near the end of the American Civil War. History Sister's Ferry is a ferry crossing the Savannah River established sometime after 1820. The site is approximately 2 miles downstream of an older ferry-crossing site, Two Sister's Ferry, where loyalists in the Southern Campaign of the American Revolutionary War crossed the Savannah River on March 12, 1780. It is approximately 35 miles upstream from the City of Savannah. Sherman's Army Crossing After Sherman captured Savannah, the culmination of his march to the sea, he was ordered by Union Army general-in- chief Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to embark his army on ships to reinforce the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James in Virginia, where Grant was bogged down in the Siege of Petersburg against Confederate General Robert E. Lee. However, he persuaded Grant that he should march north through the Carolinas instead, destroying everything of military value along the way, similar to his march to the sea through Georgia. Sherman was particularly interested in targeting South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union, for the effect it would have on Southern morale. General Sherman gave orders on January 19, 1865 to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, commander of the XIV and XX Corps, to cross the Savannah River into South Carolina at Sisters Ferry and Pocotaligo. At first, General Solcum was delayed by heavy rainfall; the wing was not able to leave the city of Savannah until January 29, 1865. By February 2, Slocum's wing still struggled to cross at the ferry point and lagged behind the rest of Sherman's Army in entering South Carolina. Once they crossed the river, the wing proceeded up Sisters Ferry Road towards the town of Robertville, SC.

Description  Though sometimes mistaken for Bombus lapidarius, Bombus ruderarius varies slightly in appearance from B. lapidarius in several ways. Bombus ruderarius is a relatively small bumblebee with a wide abdomen, an oblong face, and a fairly long tongue. The queen has an average length of and a wingspan of , while the other castes are somewhat smaller; the workers have an average length of and the males . Their colour is prominently black, with a red tail; among males, however, a lighter form exists with yellow-green hairs on the thorax and the first two terga (abdominal segments). The corbicula (pollen basket) on the hind legs of females (queens and workers) is covered with yellow-red hair.  Ecology  The nest is constructed of grass or moss, on or slightly below ground, and typically contains 50 to 100 workers. Often, old mouse nests in open grassland and scrubs are used. The species can, however, also appear in sparsely built-up urban areas as gardens and wasteland. Food sources include deadnettles, clover, vetch, and legumes as bird's-foot trefoil.  Distribution  This species is found in Europe and northwest Asia from Ireland and Great Britain in the west to Siberia and northwest China in the east, northwards to the Gulf of Botnia and the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia, and southwards to North Africa, southern Italy, Greece, and the Balkans. The distribution is uneven; in North Africa it is considered very rare, while in places such as the east Pyrenees, it is very common, accounting for more than half of all bumblebees in the area. In Britain, it is declining due to lack of habitat and restricted to southern England and western Scotland. It is also an endangered species in Ireland.

The revolt sparked the beginning of the revolutionary government's involvement in the Visayas. It is also one of the most overlooked conflicts in the Revolution.  Background  Before the resumption of the revolution in Luzon, various Visayan provinces had already been in revolt, The Pulajanes became a major threat to Spanish authority at the time. On July 22, 1898, Aguinaldo, in the hopes of establishing the Revolutionary government in Visayas sent Gen. Riego de Dios and Justo Lukban to assist in the revolts. They landed in the harbor only to find the capital town of Masbate in ruins. With the commander in chief, Pedro Quipte, a Pulajan general and his men, who saw the two patriots, preparations began to end the liberation of the province, as it turned out that the Pulajan forces had done their siege to the town and the enemy had fled. It was recommended that the forces be disbanded and a local Philippine Revolutionary Army unit be activated in their place. The battle As early as August 1, The governor of Masbate, Don Luis Cubero y Rojas, planned to leave the island following increased threats of a Pulajanes attack. The Pulajanes movement itself was said to have been established in Malobago, Cataingan, Masbate. Considered as illiterate fanatics by the educated class of Masbate, the Pulajanes failed to get their support and they besieged the main town on the island and laid waste to it, however, the Pulajanes treated as enemies much like the Spaniards people with educational backgrounds, many locals thus defected. Don Luis Cubero and the remnants of his 1,000 strong army fled the capital on August 19, 1898, soon afterwards, the Pulajanes burned the town to the ground and looted each house before later returning to their bases in Uson. Riego de Dios arrived at the ruined town and met up with Quipte and his men. Later he convinced Quipte to disband the Pulajan movement for he deemed it unnecessary to maintain such a large army in the province, thus the men were ordered to stand down.  Naval Engagement and establishment of revolutionary government  In the bay of the Masbate, the revolutionary forces had a brief encounter with the Spanish squadron consisting of five gunboats and a brigantine that resulted to the sinking of the Filipino ship Bulusan. Pedro Quipte, the leader of the pulahan, did not return to Masbate after Riego de Dios commissioned him to deliver the instruction to the captain of Isabe who was in Cataingan to hide the ship from the enemies. Meanwhile, local governments were set up in the towns along the coast up to Cataingan. The representatives from the revolutionary government were well received in all towns of Masbate, the people showed their willingness and cooperation to establish a new government under the revolutionaries government. The provinces of Masbate and Sorsogon were placed under the auspice of Gen. Diokno who arrived at the end of September in San Pascual, Burias Island. A historic event was witnessed by the local people with the proclamation of the revolutionary government in the town and unfurling of the Filipino flag in the plaza.

The only known British survivor of the International Brigades to outlive Lomon was Stan Hilton,Aussie man becomes last civil war survivor who died in 2016. Biography Born in Hackney, London, Lomon was a 19-year-old rag-and-bone man when he signed up to join the International Brigade in secret in 1936 following a clash with Oswald Mosley's fascist group the Blackshirts at the Battle of Cable Street. After expressing an initial interest at a London office, the Young Communist League member was tested for his suitability for the Brigade in Paris. In December 1937 he travelled through to France and into Spain via the Pyrenees at night, avoiding Franco's border guards. He then joined the British Battalion of the 15th International Brigade.¬°No Pasar√°n! David Lomon 1918-2012, survivor of the International Brigade He fought on the Republican side in the two-month Battle of Teruel and in the Aragon Offensive where the Republican side faced the might of Franco's forces which were bolstered by more than 100,000 extra troops supplied by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Lomon was captured by Italian forces on 31 March 1938 during fighting in Aragon and was taken to the crowded prisoner-of-war camp at San Pedro de Carde√±as near Burgos in northern Spain. He survived brutal beatings, a lack of medical facilities and a starvation diet. He was eventually exchanged for Italian prisoners-of-war held captive in Britain in October 1938. Amongst the British members of the International Brigade that Lomon fought alongside were the trade union leader Jack Jones and writers George Orwell and Laurie Lee. In World War II, Lomon joined the Royal Navy. He eventually returned to Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, and worked in the textile trade.Briton who fought against Franco's fascists dies, aged 94 International Brigade veteran Lomom attended many ceremonies of the veterans of the International Brigade, including the unveiling of a volunteers' memorial on London's South Bank in the Spring of 2011.

After winning three of his four starts as a juvenile, the colt won the Satsuki Sh≈ç at Nakayama Racecourse in April 2010. After an unsuccessful campaign in Europe he returned to Japan to win the weight-for-age invitational Arima Kinen in December. In the following spring he was sent to Dubai where he raced for the first time on a synthetic track in the Dubai World Cup. He defeated an international field to become the first Japanese-trained horse to win the world's most valuable race. His subsequent career was restricted by injury problems and he was retired at the end of 2011. Background Victoire Pisa is a dark bay horse bred at the Shadai Farm in Hokkaido. His sire Neo Universe, a son of the thirteen-time leading sire in Japan Sunday Silence, was a successful Japanese performer, winning the Satsuki Sh≈ç and the Tokyo Y≈´shun, the first two legs of the Japanese Triple Crown in 2003. At stud he has sired the Satsuki Sh≈ç winner Unrivaled and the Tokyo Y≈´shun winner Logi Universe. Victoire Pisa's dam Whitewater Affair was a successful British racehorse who won the John Porter Stakes and the Prix de Pomone as a four-year-old in 1997. At stud in Britain she bred the Yasuda Kinen winner Asakusa Denen, and was then exported to Japan where her other foals included the Group Three winner Swift Current. The colt was prepared for racing by Katsuhiko Sumii, the trainer of Delta Blues and Vodka. Racing career 2009: two-year-old season Victoire Pisa opened his racing career with three races at Kyoto Racecourse in late 2009. On 25 October he ran in a nine furlong event for unraced horses in which he finished second to Rose Kingdom, a colt who went on to win the Japan Cup. Two weeks later he recorded his first win in a ten furlong maiden race. On 28 November Victoire Pisa started the 1/2 favourite for the Kyoto Nisai Stakes and won by one and a half lengths. On his final start of the year he was moved up in class for the domestic Group Three Radio Nikkei Hai Nisai Stakes at Hanshin Racecourse on 26 December. Starting the 3/5 favourite he took the lead near the finish and won by a neck from Cosmo Phantom. 2010: three-year-old season Victoire Pisa after winning the Satsuki Sh≈ç Victoire Pisa began his three-year-old season in March at Nakayama Racecourse in the Hochi Hai Yayoi Sh≈ç, a trial race for the Satsuki Sh≈ç. Despite having to be switched to obtain a clear run he took the lead 50 yards from the line and won by half a length from Eishin Apollon. In the Satsuki Sh≈ç a month later he started the 1.3/1 favourite in a field of eighteen three- year-old colts. Ridden by Yasunari Iwata he again struggled to get a clear run in the straight before accelerating through a gap along the rail to take the lead inside the final furlong and win from Hiruno d'Amour, Eishin Flash and Rose Kingdom. On 30 May Victoire Pisa started 11/10 favourite for the Tokyo Yushun over one and a half miles at Tokyo Racecourse. Yet again, he had a troubled passage, and was in eighth place two furlongs from the finish. Despite making steady progress in the closing stages he finished third behind Eishin Flash and Rose Kingdom. Victoire Pisa was then sent to Europe where he was trained with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe as his main objective. He finished fourth behind Behkabad in the Prix Niel at Longchamp Racecourse in September and then finished seventh of the nineteen runners behind Workforce in the Arc a month later. On his return from Europe, Victoire Pisa was made a 27/1 outsider for the Japan Cup at Tokyo on 28 November. In a controversial race the colt took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by Buena Vista inside the final furlong and lost second place on the line to Rose Kingdom. An inquiry by the racecourse stewards saw the winner disqualified for causing interference to the runner-up. Victoire Pisa was one of fifteen horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen on 26 December at Nakayama. Ridden for the first time by the Italian jockey Mirco Demuro he started at odds of 7.4/1 in a field which included Buena Vista, Eishin Flash, Dream Journey and Oken Bruce Lee. In front of a crowd of 120,813 Victoire Pisa was always among the leaders and moved up quickly to take the lead entering the straight. He held off the late challenge of the favourite Buena Vista to win by a nose. Demuro described the winner as \\"a fantastic horse\\" with a \\"great heart\\". At the end of the season, Victoire Pisa was voted Japanese Champion Three-year-old colt. 2011: four- year-old season Victoire Pisa at his retirement ceremony in January 2012 On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Victoire Pisa started the 2/5 favourite for the Nakayama Kinen over nine furlongs on 27 February. He took the lead in the straight and won comfortably by two and a half lengths from Captain Thule. The colt was then sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai World Cup at Meydan Racecourse on 26 March. The race was run over ten furlongs on a synthetic Tapeta footings surface and attracted runners from Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Demuro restrained the colt in last place before moving up to join the leaders half a mile from the finish of a slowly run race. He took the lead in the straight and held off the challenge of his fellow Japanese challenger Transcend by half a length with Monterosso in third and Cape Blanco in fourth. Victoire Pisa became the first Japanese-trained horse to win the \\"world's richest race\\". The victory was an emotional one for the Japanese contingent, coming less than three weeks after the country had been struck by an earthquake and tsunami: Demuro returned to the winner's enclosure in tears, whilst Katsuhiko Sumii said that he felt that \\"the whole country was behind me.\\" Victoire Pisa was sent to Europe again but did not contest any races after sustaining a series of leg injuries. Victoire Pisa returned to Japan at the end of the year but was unable to reproduce his early season form. He finished thirteenth behind Buena Vista in the Japan Cup and eighth behind Orfevre in the Arima Kinen. He was retired from racing at the end of December. Sumii commented on the colt's retirement by saying that \\"I feel I should apologise to him because I couldn't get him back to his best but at least I am happy that I can send him to the stud without any further accidents\\". Victoire Pisa was named Japanese Champion Older Male for 2011. Stud record Victoire Pisa was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Shadai Stallion Station. He made an immediate impact by siring the Oka Sho winner Jeweler in his first crop of foals.

Kimber was acquitted, but the trial gained much attention in the press. The case established that slave ships' crew could be tried for murder of slaves. Publicity about the case contributed to growing opposition to the African slave trade, which parliament prohibited in its colonies by the Slave Trade Act 1807.  Murder In 1791, John Kimber was the captain of the Recovery, a slave ship of 189 tons from Bristol, England.Marshall 1972, p. 207. The Recovery travelled from Bristol to New Calabar in West Africa, where it collected approximately 300 slaves who were to be sold at Grenada in the Caribbean. The vessel left Africa on 1 September, and arrived at Grenada on 28 October, by which time 27 of the slaves had died.Richardson 1996, p. 193. \\"Dancing the slaves\\" was a regular part of the routine of a slave ship on the Middle Passage; the captain and crew worked to ensure that slaves, who were confined to the extremely cramped and unhygienic conditions below decks, received at least a degree of fresh air and regular exercise on deck. Those who refused to take part in the dancing were flogged.Maccotta 2007, pp. 132-3. On 2 April 1792, William Wilberforce made a speech to parliament at the end of a debate on the abolition of the slave trade.Marshall 1972, p. 206. He gave two examples of the atrocities associated with the slave trade, in order to appeal to the sympathy of fellow members of parliament. Firstly, he described an attack on Calabar by British slave ships, which bombarded the city in order to force its traders to lower the price of slaves.Swaminathan 2010, p. 487. The second example was the case of Captain Kimber, whom Wilberforce alleged had murdered a teenage slave girl on his ship who refused to dance for exercise. Kimber was said to have repeatedly lashed the girl and to have had her several times suspended by one leg and then dropped to the deck of the ship. Following this maltreatment, she died. In his speech, Wilberforce emphasised the innocence of the girl. He downplayed the captain's claims (subsequently reported in the press) that she suffered from an unidentified preexisting medical condition causing lassitude and that she had gonorrhea.Swaminathan 2010, p. 489. Isaac Cruikshank's depiction of Kimber's assault on a \\"virjen,\\" in his image published at the time, also emphasises her innocence in the face of the captain's aggression and moral corruption. On 7 April 1792, Kimber placed advertisements in several newspapers proclaiming his innocence. The charges against Kimber were soon reported in the press, as were accounts of his trial beginning in June 1792. Such reports rapidly crossed the Atlantic and were published in ten American newspapers.  The Trial  Wilberforce in 1790 Kimber was arrested in Bristol on 8 April, and taken to London the next day. His trial at the Admiralty Sessions of the Old Bailey began on 7 June 1792, and was attended by many prominent public figures, including Horatio Nelson.Swaminathan 2010, p. 490.Sugden 2011, p. 399. The trial revealed little about Kimber's alleged crimes beyond what Wilberforce had said to parliament and was reported in the press.Swaminathan 2010, p. 493 The attention soon turned to the key witnesses testifying against Kimber. Thomas Dowling, the ship's surgeon, was revealed to have a vendetta against Kimber; another witness, Stephen Devereux, was a former mutineer. Three witnesses attested to Kimber's good character, but no witness was called to affirm that Kimber had not ordered a slave girl to be tied up and flogged. Kimber was acquitted. In 1793 Dowling and Devereux were tried for perjury, with Dowling being found guilty. Several accounts of the trial were published, which were supportive of Kimber to varying degrees.Swaminathan 2010, p. 494. Kimber pursued Wilberforce for damages after the trial, and continually loitered outside his house.Hague 2008, p. 210. Wilberforce later noted that Kimber's acquittal had been one of the few instances in the abolition campaign that had brought him distress.Marshall 1972, p. 211.  Historical significance  In 1781, the crew of the slave ship Zong deliberately killed approximately 132 slaves by throwing them overboard, later claiming the entire ship and its cargo were endangered by lack of water. None of the crew was ever tried for murder, and the subsequent court cases established the legality of their act under specific circumstances of ensuring survival of the ship, crew and remaining slaves. The judge ruled against the insurers' paying for the loss of slaves because of new information revealed at the appeal hearing, which suggested the captain and crew were at fault for the shortage of water.Krikler 2007, pp. 36‚Äì8. Swaminathan says that neither the killings nor the 1783 court cases received much attention in the press or in parliament.Swaminathan 2010, pp. 483, 496. But nearly 300 Quakers were moved to send a petition to parliament against slavery in July 1783 because of this trial.Rupprecht, \\"A Very Uncommon Case\\" (2007), pp. 336‚Äì7. Walvin notes that by the late 1780s, the Zong case had become an important symbol of the abuses of the slave trade, having inspired anti-slavery writings by Thomas Clarkson, Ottobah Cugoano, James Ramsay and John Newton.Lovejoy 2006, p. 337.Swaminathan 2010, pp. 483‚Äì4. and stimulating the rapid growth of the abolitionist movement.Walvin 2011, pp. 176‚Äì9. It is significant that, only a decade after the Zong massacre, Kimber as captain of a slave ship was tried for murder in his maltreatment of a slave, and that the case received widespread attention in the newspapers.Swaminathan 2010, pp. 483, 487. As the Public Advertiser commented after Kimber's trial, the case had at least established that those who killed slaves could be tried for murder.

It is the fourth carousel on the site where it is located. History The original 1871 carousel was powered by a mule or horse under its platform, signaled to start and stop by the operator tapping his foot. The two succeeding versions were destroyed by fires in 1924 and 1950.\\"Carousel\\" on the Central Park Conservancy website The current carousel is the fourth on the site, p.133 and is part of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission's \\"scenic landmark\\" designation for Central Park. The carousel was made by Solomon Stein and Harry Goldstein in 1908. It was originally installed in a trolley terminal in Coney Island, Brooklyn, where it operated until the 1940s. It was relocated to Central Park in 1951 with a new structure surrounding it. The carousel was restored in 1990 by the Central Park Conservancy. In 2010, the city evicted the previous tenant who managed the Carousel. Trump Organization, a prominent New York City conglomerate owned by Donald Trump that also operated the nearby Wollman Rink, was selected as the new tenant. In return for a lease until 2020, Trump promised to invest $400,000 in renovations over ten years and pay a yearly lease that started at $250,000 and scaled up to $325,000. In statements released as part of the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign, the Carousel grossed $1.72 million between 2013 and the end of 2015. The contract to operate the carousel was later extended through 2021. Description The Interior of the Carousel showing the Ruth & Shon Model 33.

Early life and education Basha was born in Cairo on 2 December 1922. He graduated from police academy in 1945. Career Basha was a leading figure during the Nasser era. He served as deputy interior minister when Nabawi Ismail was in office under President Anwar Sadat. As assistant minister, he organized operations against fundamentalists and arrested them at the end of the 1970s. He also carried out such operations following the assassination of Anwar Sadat in October 1981. Basha was appointed interior minister in January 1982 by President Hosni Mobarak, replacing Nabawi Ismail in the post. Basha preferred dialogue instead of coercion to deal with social and political problems. His attitude towards the Islamists, including the Muslim Brotherhood, had positive consequences. Basha's term lasted until July 1984, and he was replaced by Ahmed Rushdi as interior minister. Basha's removal was unexpected, since he was considered to be one of the significant figures in the regime of Mobarak. Basha was appointed minister of local government in July 1984. Assassination attempt On 5 May 1987, Basha survived an assassination attempt perpetrated by the Islamist militants, including Ayman Zawahiri's brother Hussein Zawahiri. The attack was organized near Basha's home in Cairo, and unknown gunmen seriously injured Basha. Basha underwent surgery following the attack. The terrorist group Salvation from Hell claimed the responsibility of the attack. Some members of the group were arrested in August 1987. The group also attempted to kill former interior minister Nabawi Ismail and an Egyptian journalist after the attack. Upon this event, Egypt broke all diplomatic ties with Iran, claiming that the group which perpetrated the attack was financially supported by Iran. Hussein Zawahiri was convicted for his alleged role in the assassination attempt. Yasser Al Borhamy was also detained for a month due to his alleged connection with the assassination attempt against Basha. Books Basha published his memoirs in a book entitled Mudhukrat Hasan Abu Basha (Memoirs of Hasan Abu Basha in English) in 1990. Death Basha died at the age of 82 in Cairo on 18 September 2005. Awards Basha was the recipient of the Republic second class medal in 1973 and the second class merit medal in 1979.

The group was formed in 1996 after band leader Walter Ramsey saw a performance by the Rebirth Brass Band. The Stooges Brass Band is known for incorporating elements of hip hop, funk and R&B; into a more traditional brass band framework. The band has played the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, and South by Southwest. In 2012, they were selected by the U.S. State Department to tour Pakistan, and became the first American band to play in Hyderabad. Biography The Stooges Brass Band started in 1996 when band leader Walter Ramsey combined members of two rival high school marching bands. After seeing the Rebirth Brass Band play, Ramsey was inspired to experiment with merging hip hop, funk, and R & B, influences into a traditional New Orleans brass band framework. The band name evolved out of their stage antics, when one of the band members referred to the rest as ‚Äúa bunch of stooges.‚Äù Early members included Trombone Shorty, ‚ÄôBig‚Äô Sam Williams, Drew Baham, Ellis Joseph, Sammy Cyrus, and Dwayne Williams. Over the next decade, the Stooges Brass Band gained a reputation in local clubs and second line parades. Early successes included recording with Jessica Simpson, and production work for ESPN. Red Bull Street Kings competition In October 2010, the Stooges Brass Band won the Red Bull Street Kings competition. The event featured four prominent brass bands in an elimination-style competition. Red Bull flew the band out to their L.A. studios to record an EP and video music series with hip hop producer Mannie Fresh. The event was covered by the Documentary Channel, who released a documentary in 2011. Touring In April 2011, the Stooges Brass Band won the Best Contemporary Brass Band award from the Big Easy Music Awards. The band began touring more aggressively in 2012, playing Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Edinburgh Jazz Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Essence Music Festival, Lincoln Center Out Of Doors Series, South by Southwest, and others. In June 2012, the band was selected by the U.S. State Department to serve as cultural ambassadors on a tour to Pakistan. They performed in Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi, and Hyderabad. Can't Be Faded In 2020, the Stooges became the first brass band in New Orleans to author a book with the release of Can‚Äôt Be Faded: Twenty Years in the New Orleans Brass Band Game, published by the University Press of Mississippi.

Elia wrestles on the independent circuit, mainly for Ohio Valley Wrestling in Louisville, Kentucky, and formerly in the Northeast United States. At the age of 18 Elias appeared at TNA Wrestling's TNA Gut Check in a match against Doug Williams on the September 20, 2012, episode of Impact Wrestling, making him the youngest person to appear on Impact television. Professional wrestling career Early years and training Markopoulos grew up in Hudson, Massachusetts. He graduated from Hudson High School in 2012. The summer after seventh grade, at the age of 13, he decided to begin professional wrestling training. In 2007 he began training at the Killer Kowalski School of Wrestling (today the New England Pro Wrestling Academy). Elia has trained under Mike Hollow, Todd Hansen, Brian Milonas, and Brian Fury. However, he credits the Chaotic Training Center as a whole, Ohio Valley Wrestling, and Al Snow as his trainers. Independent circuit (2008‚Äìpresent) Elias has worked for a number of different independent professional wrestling promotions across the Northeast United States. Elia fought his first match at the age of 14 against Nick Gamma. He has worked for such promotions as Chaotic Wrestling, New England Championship Wrestling, Millennium Wrestling Federation, Top Rope Promotions, Beyond Wrestling, NWA On Fire, CTWE, Eastern Wrestling Alliance, NWA Vintage Pro, East Coast Wrestling Association, Showcase Pro Wrestling, UFO Wrestling, PWF Northeast, and Big Time Wrestling. Markopolous stated in an interview that he considers capturing the Chaotic Wrestling New England Championship at just 15 years old his greatest achievement as a wrestler. Elia has been a standout performer in his area since 2009. Before taking on his Chaotic Wrestling alias of Elia Markopoulos, he was known as The Masked Vortex and Evan Young. In late 2009, after winning the New England Championship with the help of Alex Arion, Elias started teamed up with Arion, a long-time heel in New England. The duo dubbed themselves the Greek Squad. The babyface team failed to capture the Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Championship numerous times, causing Elia to turn heel on Arion in late 2011. The former tag partners then had a match at Cold Fury 10 in 2012, with Arion leaving victorious. Later in 2012, after Arion had been taken out due to injury by Elia, Markopoulos joined forces with Frankie Arion (Alex's kayfabe brother) and named themselves the Greek Squad. In August 2012 Arion returned and ultimately joined the heel faction again, though this time with Elia as the leader. On the June 15, 2012, episode of WWE Smackdown, under the ring name Ari Cohen, Elias competed on WWE television. Elias tagged with Mike Testa, losing in a handicap match to Ryback. On January 18, 2013, at Chaotic's first event of the year, Elias returned after a three-month hiatus and defeated Mark Shurman, and joined Sean Gorman's empire along with his former trainer Todd Hansen. At Cold Fury 12, on March 1, 2013, Elias captured the vacant Chaotic Wrestling New England Championship in a four-way match, winning the championship for the second time in his career. He later vacated the title in early June 2013. In July 2013 Markopoulos was kayfabe fired from Chaotic Wrestling by then heel president Sean Gorman because Markopoulos was moving to Louisville to further his wrestling training with Ohio Valley Wrestling. Markopoulos did return to Chaotic Wrestling in April 2014. On September 10, 2016, Markopoulos appeared on the Evolve Wrestling 68 show in Deer Park, New York. On July 19, 2019, Markopoulos made his return after a four-month hiatus from Chaotic Wrestling, this time under the moniker Evan Wallbridge. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2012) Elias received national recognition after appearing as a contestant on TNA Gut Check using the ring name Evan Markopoulos. He competed in a try out against Douglas Williams on the September 20, 2012 episode of Impact Wrestling. Evan would lose and was ultimately not awarded a contract (though he was given a developmental contract). At only 18 years old, Evan became the youngest TNA Gut Check contestant ever. On August 28, 2013, Markopoulos made his Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) debut as a heel in a dark match losing to Dylan Bostic. A few months after starting a friendly heel versus heel feud with Bostic, the two ended the feud and began teaming together due to their cheating and lying antics. Markopoulos was waived from his TNA contract in June 2015.

It is distinctive not only for its size and remoteness, but also for having not one but two movable spans, one having replaced the other due to river avulsion. The Yancopin Bridge was originally constructed by the Memphis, Helena & Louisiana Railway, a wholly owned subsidiary of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway that was known colloquially as Iron Mountain. The Iron Mountain itself became consolidated with the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1881, but became fully merged later on in 1917. The single-track bridge is an all-metal truss bridge, designed with one lift span and with lengthy wooden trestle approaches at both ends. History The bridge was reportedly completed in 1903, but the track segment served by this bridge, between Watson and New Latour, was not opened for service until March 1, 1906. Floods periodically brought changes to the Arkansas River channel and necessitated numerous rebuilding projects for the bridge over the years, including the addition of a swing span sometime after World War II as the navigable channel under the lift span drifted shut. Articles in Missouri Pacific Lines Magazine describe this bridge as being perhaps the most expensive bridge on the entire Missouri Pacific system. On May 11, 1941, Missouri Pacific inaugurated the Delta Eagle, the railroad's first diesel-powered streamlined train serving Arkansas. This train operated between Memphis, Tennessee and Tallulah, Louisiana via the Yancopin bridge. Although this unlikely route was financially very successful during World War II, traffic gradually declined in the 1950s and passenger service was cut back on October 27, 1954 to include only a McGehee-Watson-Yancopin-Helena schedule. This truncated schedule often utilized Missouri Pacific's only streamlined motorcar known as the Eagle, motor 670, before passenger service was discontinued altogether on February 27, 1960, thus ending passenger train service over the Yancopin bridge. In April 1980, the Missouri Pacific began a major upgrading of their railroad line between McGehee and Paragould, in order to divert chemical trains from a route passing through highly populated areas of Little Rock. After installation of 127 miles of welded rail, trackside signals, centralized traffic control and numerous bridge repair projects, chemical trains from the Texas and Louisiana Gulf coasts began using this new line in early 1981. This usage was short-lived. In December 1982, the Missouri Pacific merged with the Union Pacific Railroad, and the new Union Pacific management determined that the route over the Yancopin bridge was surplus and unnecessary. Chemical traffic was again returned to the traditional Missouri Pacific route through the center of Little Rock, and parts of the railroad north of McGehee were embargoed and later abandoned. In 1992, Union Pacific removed the bridge from service, and donated it and a 73-mile right-of-way to the State of Arkansas. This enabled the creation of the Delta Heritage Trail. The bridge is maintained by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department, and the swing span is manually spun open and closed for logging traffic on the river for several months every year. The area around the bridge is rich in wildlife, including rattlesnakes. North of the Yancopin Bridge, the rail line/trail traverses old-growth hardwood forest within the Trusten Holder State Wildlife Management Area. The bridge can be accessed from Watson, Arkansas, via County Road 41.

The location of the station was strategically critical: it lay directly at the southern entrance of the Irish Sea, within 12 miles of Tuskar Lighthouse. For over four years, Tuskar Rock was one of the most important navigational marks in Irish waters; the area became known as the Graveyard of Ships, due to the many sinkings by enemy submarines within three or four miles and in plain view of lighthouse. A great deal of Allied shipping to and from Ireland and England passed through nearby waters. Enemy submarines also used the Irish Sea as a short cut to and from their bases, and it was a fertile field for their operations; thus the Wexford area was a very busy with ASW activity, both offensive and defensive. Before the flying boats from this station began operations, submarines were exceptionally bold within the patrol area of Wexford. The naval air station was located along the Slaney River across from Wexford town;History of Town Wexford Borough Council it was well protected from wind, waves and weather due to the almost land-locked harbor. It is also easily accessible for transportation and shipping. There had been some work performed by British Admiralty before the US Forces arrived at Wexford; part of the concrete hangar foundations had been laid, the roads were marked off and a portion of them excavated to receive the rock base. Contracted civilian labor had also done some work in draining the field behind the site of the hangars. But at that time, it was not certain that a Naval Air Station would ever be built. The US naval men spent their first week in a general cleaning up and renovating the Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ), titled the Ely House and Bann Aboo while including the surrounding grounds. Both BOQ's were formerly mansions. It was a little odd to see American sailors doing housework in time of war, and in Ireland. No unnecessary work was done, however, and quickly the grounds were staked out, holes dug, posts set and building begun. The US Naval Airmen encountered problems as supplies and insufficient clothing (coats and rubber boots) had not yet arrived. It rained incessantly, and the site was a field of mud. Working hours were from 5 am to 9 pm, and all hands took turns at standing night watches. Makeshift beds were laid on cold and damp wooden floors. Many times the men went with insufficient sleep and started the new day's work feeling worse for what rest they did have. Tentative plans for the station were made before 15 March 1918, but when Commanding Officer Herbster arrived on 28 March 1918, many changes were made. The whole station was planned for maximum centralization; each building to be near the work to be performed and yet concentrated as far as possible into the minimum space. At the time the barracks were being erected at the rate of little better than one a day. In the meantime, civilian contract labor was working on the road construction, the concrete hangar foundations, aprons and slipway, the drainage systems, reservoir and reserve water tanks. They were also erecting the first hangar.  Civilian workmen strike and return  Due to some grievance, a general strike was called by the civilian workforce during the erection of the first hangar, but the strike was soon mitigated. By 1 August 1918, there was still a considerable amount of minor work to be accomplished, and it was rapidly nearing the time for the arrival of the seaplanes. The first hangar had been completed by the civilian contractors along with the reservoir, the small water tank and majority of the road forming. The civilian workforce was dismissed on 15 August. The erection of the second hangar immediately started and the work progressed rapidly.  Aircraft  When the four Curtiss H-16s arrived from Queenstown 18 September 1918, practically all construction work was finished and the station was ready to receive them. The arrival of the seaplanes marked the transition to an operational base. The very next day, aircraft sortied on their first patrol, and every day thereafter, provided the weather was at all favorable. They kept in constant touch with the station by radio. In October 1918, another aircraft was sent to this station, one of the original four having been damaged before delivery; this made four available for duty. 6 November 1918, another arrived, making five available for ASW patrol operations. This Naval Air Station was to have 18 Curtiss H-16s upon station complement. The planes would patrol as many hours as possible during the day and be overhauled and repaired during the night. In many instances the men worked 18 hours straight for days at a time. This Naval Air Station remained accident and mishap free throughout its mission.  Operations  Within three days of the start of operations and regular patrol flights, 21 September 1918, UB 104 (Type UB III) of the Flandern II Flotilla was successfully bombed in the approximate location of Lyme Bay, England by NAS Wexford aircrew. Pilot Herbert McLean Purdy was awarded the Navy Cross for this event. On 11 October 1918, the day after RMS Leinster was sunk in the Irish Sea off Dublin, one of the US planes sighted and bombed an enemy submarine in the area. This submarine showed signs of serious distress, and had trouble submerging. Thick, dark oil was seen on the surface for about a week after the bombing. 13 October, a submarine was bombed by a plane from NAS Wexford.. Then on 16 October 1918, an H-16 aircraft out of Wexford crewed by NAS Wexford Ltjg John F. McNamara, LTjg George Shaw and NAS Queenstown LTjg James Roy Biggs dropped bombs on a submarine which disappeared under water leaving debris and oil. Although destruction seemed certain, it was assessed as \\"probably seriously damaged‚Äù. Carrier pigeons were also released from time to time to test, and in several cases to meet an emergency. Although operations at NAS Wexford ceased after only 8 weeks due to the Armistice, the planes of this station made 98 patrol flights with a total of 312 hours in the air. The flights consisted of patrol and convoy with a few instruction flights; most of the second pilots qualified as first pilots from instruction received on regular patrol. The Intelligence Department assisted, by having complete courses mapped out, already corrected for compass error and wind deflection; this, together with reliable information from the Meteorological Department, enabled aircraft to fly on days that would otherwise have been lost.  End of hostilities and closure  When the news of the Armistice was received, the planes had to be disarmed and all progressive construction and operation had to cease. Within 12 days the first draft left the station. 200 men were on their way back to the USA and the rest almost ready to leave. With the end of the war, the U.S. Naval Air Stations in Ireland were no longer required. The Anti-submarine warfare patrols were discontinued and the aircraft were grounded and disarmed as the base closed on 15 February 1919. The slipway used for launching and retrieving the seaplanes is still visible.

Trimble Bozeman (n√©e Sylvia Trimble, 1947) is an American mathematician and mathematics educator.Notable Women in Mathematics, a Biographical Dictionary, edited by Charlene Morrow and Teri Perl, Greenwood Press, 1998. pp 17‚Äì21 Early life and education Sylvia Bozeman was born in Camp Hill, Alabama on 1 August 1947. She was the third of five children to Horace T., Sr. and Robbie Jones. Although her father worked with numbers daily in his profession as an insurance agent, it was her mother, a housewife, who first cultivated Bozeman‚Äôs love for mathematics. Bozeman attended segregated primary and secondary schools in Camp Hill, and was encouraged by her teachers and parents to continue her education. Her high school mathematics teacher, Mr. Frank Holley, further cultivated her interest. He came back after school and taught trigonometry (a course not offered in the curriculum) to her and a group of committed students. Bozeman graduated from Edward Bell High School in Camp Hill in 1964 and enrolled for her undergraduate studies in mathematics at Alabama A&M; University, during which she also worked on summer projects at NASA and Harvard University. She graduated in 1968 as salutatorian and moved with her husband Robert, also a mathematician, to non-segregated Vanderbilt University, where they both began their graduate studies. She earned a master's degree in 1970, despite not having studied much of the prerequisite coursework that her white classmates had.In 1968 linear algebra was just making its way on to the scene as a regular required course in mathematics curricula. It was offered for the first time when she was a senior at Alabama A&M;, but she didn't take it. The Vanderbilt faculty suggested Bozeman take it her first year in graduate school, but when she realized it was an undergraduate course, she refused. \\"I paid for that decision for the rest of my graduate years. I spent a long time trying to learn linear algebra on my own,\\" she laments. Doctorate and career \\"As my career provides me with many opportunities of professional involvement, it is my commitment to always remain 'connected' with mathematics through teaching and/or other scholarly endeavors, and to continue to promote the development of women in mathematics.\\" -- Sylvia Bozeman, 1997 The Bozemans had a son and a daughter while Sylvia taught part-time at Vanderbilt and Tennessee State University and Robert finished his doctoral studies in mathematics.The areas of her research and publications have included operator theory in functional analysis, projects in image processing, and efforts to enhance the success of groups currently underrepresented in mathematics.She earned her PhD with her thesis title : \\"Representations of Generalized Inverses of Fredholm Operators.\\"Graduating in 1980, Bozeman became only the 23rd or 24th black women math Ph.D. in the U.S. In 1974, Bozeman took a teaching position at Spelman College, a college for Black women in Atlanta, Georgia; Robert was then teaching at Morehouse College, another historically Black college. For over 35 years she has taught mathematics at America's oldest historically black college for women. Located just west of downtown, Spelman's campus sits adjacent Morehouse College. While there, she worked under Shirley Mathis McBay, Etta Zuber Falconer, and Gladys Glass, mathematicians who were pushing to improve Spelman's science and mathematics programs. She began as an instructor in 1972, became assistant professor in 1980, an associate in 1984, and full professor in 1991.Throughout her years at Spelman, professor Bozeman has taught a variety of classes--calculus, abstract algebra, transition to higher math, and even her old nemesis linear algebra. She also enjoys mentoring students and junior faculty. In 1976, Bozeman took up graduate studies again at Emory University while continuing to hold a position at Spelman. She earned her doctorate in 1980 from Emory, under the supervision of Luis Kramarz and John Neuberger; her thesis was titled Representations of Generalized Inverses of Fredholm Operators. Moreover, Bozeman served as chair of the Mathematics Department from 1982 to 1993, as adjunct faculty in the Math Department at Atlanta University from 1983 to 1985. In 1993, Bozeman established the Center for the Scientific Applications of Mathematics at Spelman College, and served as director.At Spelman she has also been a Vice Provost. Sylvia Bozeman was one of the founders of Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE), a transition program for women entering graduate studies in the mathematical sciences. Male faculty tend to be less sensitive to the ways in which women treat their studies, Bozeman says. For example, in class, women might say very little unless they really know what they are talking about. \\"Women make a B on an exam and they are crushed, they think it's terrible. Men make a B and they think it's great,\\" she says. The EDGE program brings in senior graduates and panelists. The students form study groups and learn how to give and receive information. Critical to graduate school survival, says Bozeman. In 2007 the EDGE Program was given special recognition by the American Mathematics Society for its effectiveness. Bozeman retired from Spelman in 2013, after serving the college for 39 years. Research and recognition Bozeman's noted scholarly activities include several publications, funded research (by NASA, the US Office of Army Research and the Kellogg Foundation); and her recognition, contributions, and services as a gifted teacher and presenter. Her research there has focused on functional analysis and image processing, and has been funded by the Army Research Office, National Science Foundation, and NASA. Sylvia Bozeman also has a strong commitment to community service. The elementary students' Tutorial Program at Friendship Baptist Church is one of her favorites. In July her tireless efforts to encourage women from underrepresented groups to pursue graduate degrees in mathematics were recognized by President Obama when he appointed her to the President‚Äôs Committee on the National Medal of Science.

He commanded first battalion on the Walcheren expedition (1809), and also in the Peninsula from 1811 to 1812. He died on campaign at Coria. Biography Charles Stewart, born in 1775, was the eldest son of Thomas Stewart of Drumin, Banffshire, a lieutenant in the 56th foot, and Anne (n√©e Gordon). After serving for a short time in the Duke of Gordon's Fencibles, he was commissioned as lieutenant in the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot on 25 January 1791. He joined the regiment in India, and was wounded in the attack on Tippoo Sahib's camp at Seringapatam on 6‚Äì7 February 1792. He was with the light company, and was noticed by Lord Cornwallis. On 3 April 1794 he obtained a company in the 109th Foot, and, when that regiment was reduced in the following year, he was transferred with the men to the 53rd Foot on 2 September 1795. Stewart served several years in the West Indies, and was wounded in storming the Morne Fortun√© on St. Lucia in May 1796. He was promoted major in the regiment on 4 April 1800, and came home in command of it about 1804. On 17 February 1805 he was made lieutenant-colonel of the newly raised 2nd battalion of the 50th Foot. Sir Charles James Napier, who was major under him, wrote of him at the time as very pleasant in command and very decided, and afterwards spoke of him as one of the best officers of his rank in the service. Having been transferred to the 1st battalion, Stewart served with it in the Walcheren expedition, was left in command of the rear-guard when the army withdrew, and was mentioned in despatches. In September 1810 he went to the Peninsula with the 1st battalion, and commanded it throughout the campaigns of 1811‚Äì12. It was engaged at Fuentes de O√±oro, and was soon afterwards attached to Hill's corps, and took part in the actions of Arroyo de Molinos, battle of Almaraz, and Alba de Tormes. In the storming of Fort Napoleon at Almaraz, Stewart led the right wing of his regiment \\"in a most gallant and spirited manner\\". The hardships of the retreat to Portugal in the autumn of 1812 broke down his health, and he died at Coria on 11 December, and was buried with military honours in the campo santo (cemetery).

History In 2003, a 3.09 km-long railway line, initially used by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) at Perambur for moving newly built coaches from shell to furnishing division of the factory, was strengthened at a cost of 72.9 million for operating passenger services. Two new stations, namely, Padi and Anna Nagar, were built and 13 existing bridges were renovated and the work was completed in five months. The railway station and the EMU services were inaugurated by the then Union Minister of State for Railways, A. K. Moorthy. Between 2003 and 2007, five suburban trains were being run from Anna Nagar to Chennai Beach via Villivakkam. In 2007, the service was discontinued due to construction of a rotary at the Padi junction replacing the level-crossing. Though the rotary was completed in 2009, services were not restored. However, in 2011, the railways planned to resume services in this section as a feeder service with six-car EMUs. The tracks and land on which the station is built were originally owned by the ICF. When the Southern Railway intended to operate trains to Padi and Anna Nagar stations, the ICF handed over the land to the Southern Railway. When the train services were withdrawn in 2007, the ICF reclaimed the land from the zonal railway. The tracks and the stations are now used by the ICF for moving spare parts to the manufacturing unit and back. The lines will be used to test semi-high speed coaches running up to 160 km per hour. Patronage The service, however, had a low patronage. The average daily counter collection at the station was about 450, with just about 50 passengers. The monthly revenue never exceeded 15,000. However, unlike the rest of the Chennai Suburban Railway network, there is only one line in this section. In addition, the traffic congestion resulting due to closure of a gate near the Padi railway station limits the operation to five pairs of EMU services between Chennai Beach and Anna Nagar. In a response to a public interest litigation filed in June 2013, the Railways announced that \\"the decision to discontinue operations at Anna Nagar station was made due to financial considerations. The per-day expense for operating train services between Villivakkam and Anna Nagar costs about 30,000, while the income was only a few hundreds.\\" See also * Chennai Suburban Railway * Railway stations in Chennai References Category:Stations of Chennai Suburban Railway Category:Defunct railway stations in India Category:Railway stations in Chennai Category:Railway stations opened in 2003 Category:Memorials to C.

She began teaching at the secondary level but disliked the educational structure and methods of the day and moved to teaching at the primary level to have a greater opportunity to change teaching structure. She received a postgraduate certificate in education in 1966 and an academic diploma in education in 1968, both from the University of London. In 1967 she obtained a post as a mathematical education specialist at Battersea College of Education, which is dedicated to teacher preparation. She received her PhD from the Institute of Education in 1980 with a thesis entitled \\"The impact of education on political development\\". Career and notable works Leone Burton's contribution to mathematics education focused on researching the practices of working mathematicians and arguing their relevance for school teaching and learning. This research is included in what is now termed the field of ethnomathematics which examines how mathematics is related to the culture in which it is developed. At the Open University, Burton collaborated in creating innovative courses in teacher education, Developing Mathematical Thinking, that emphasized the role of problem solving in mathematics and argued that teachers should be aware of mathematical reasoning as well as mathematical content. A subsequent publication, Thinking Mathematically, written in 1982 with Mason and Stacey, brought these ideas to an international teacher audience focusing on teachers' own knowledge of using and applying mathematics. From 1984-1988 Burton was international convenor for the International Organization of Women and Mathematics Education and visiting professor at institutions in Asia. She played a major role in shifting teachers‚Äô perceptions in relation to girls and mathematics in the UK and other places around the world. Burton founded the monograph series International Perspective on Mathematics Education with the Greenwood Publishing group in 2001 which published three monographs between 2002‚Äì2006. This monograph series was subsequently renamed International Perspectives on Mathematics Education: Cognition, Equity and Society in honor of her pioneering work on equity and gender issues in mathematics education, edited by Bharath Sriraman, and published by Information Age Publishing. Her final book, Mathematicians as Enquirers, used interviews to characterize the ways professional mathematicians learn, including enquiry, visualization and collaboration. This research showed that the ways mathematicians learn are consistent with principles recognized in mathematics education research as suitable for school learning. Family She married John W. Burton in 1966 and they had a son in 1968.

It was developed and described by A. J√§nicke et al. in 2012. The method consists of three separate steps: in the first step, the poly-adenylated RNA is hybridised to a DNA oligonucleotide featuring a poly-deoxythymidine sequence at its 5‚Äô end. Klenow polymerase then catalyses elongation of the mRNA‚Äôs 3‚Äô end, using the DNA oligonucleotide as a template. This reaction takes place at 25 ¬∞C. In the second step, reverse transcriptase synthesis extends the DNA oligonucleotides that have annealed to the mRNA‚Äôs extended 3‚Äô end. In order to ensure that DNA oligomers hybridised to internal poly(A) sequences do not serve as primers for reverse transcription, the second step is carried out at 55 ¬∞C. A third and final step involves amplification of the newly synthesised cDNA via PCR. This PCR requires one gene-specific and one universal primer. Analysis of the amplicons‚Äô lengths allows for estimation of the sequence flanked by the two primers, i.e. the poly(A) tail length of the sample mRNA. According to the authors, measurement of poly(A) tail lengths and their distribution amongst different transcripts, this method can be used to determine the cell‚Äôs translation state instead of the more tedious analysis of protein translation states.

His work has been influenced by philosophers Denis Diderot, Arthur Schopenhauer and R. G. Collingwood.Following Collingwood, Dorschel rejects technical terminology in philosophy, aiming instead at ‚Äúthat expressiveness, that flexibility, that dependence upon context, which are the hall-marks of a literary use of words‚Äù (R.G. Collingwood, An Essay on Philosophical Method. Clarendon Press, Oxford 1933, p. 207).  Will  In Die idealistische Kritik des Willens [German Idealism‚Äôs Critique of the Will] (1992) Dorschel defends an understanding of freedom as choice against Kant‚Äôs and Hegel‚Äôs ethical animadversions. Following a method of ‚Äúcritical analysis‚Äù,Dieter H√ºning, Die ‚ÄúH√§rte des abstracten Rechts‚Äù. Person und Eigentum in Hegels Rechtsphilosophie. In: Dieter H√ºning, Gideon Stiening and Ulrich Vogel (eds.), Societas rationis. Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 2002, pp. 235‚Äì262, p. 238: ‚Äúkritische Analyse‚Äù. Dorschel objects both to Kant‚Äôs claim that ‚Äúa free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same thing‚Äù (‚Äúein freier Wille und ein Wille unter sittlichen Gesetzen einerlei‚Äù)Immanuel Kant, Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten AB 98. and to Hegel‚Äôs doctrine that ‚Äúfreedom of the will is rendered real as law‚Äù (‚Äúdie Freiheit des Willens als Gesetz verwirklicht‚Äù).Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Vorlesungen √ºber die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte, ed. Georg Lasson. Felix Meiner, Leipzig 1923ff., p. 368. What renders freedom of the will real, Dorschel argues, is rather to exercise choice sensibly.Short version of the argument in English: Andreas Dorschel, The Authority of the Will. In: The Philosophical Forum 33 (2002), no. 4, pp. 425‚Äì441. Unlike other critics of idealism, Dorschel does not endorse determinism. Determinism, if we are to make sense of the idea, would have to be correlated with the notion of prediction. Predictions, Dorschel argues, need a basis that is not affected by their being made. But just as I cannot overtake my own shadow, I cannot predict my own future behaviour from my present state. For I would alter my state by making the prediction.Cf. Andreas Dorschel, Zur Kritik des totalisierenden Erkl√§rungsprogramms. In: Vierteljahresschrift Theologie und Philosophie 63 (1988), no. 3, pp. 384‚Äì395. This line of reasoning can do without Kant‚Äôs opposition of determinism about appearances and freedom of the thing-in- itself.Cf. Andreas Dorschel, Die idealistische Kritik des Willens. Versuch √ºber die Theorie der praktischen Subjektivit√§t bei Kant und Hegel. Felix Meiner, Hamburg 1992 (Schriften zur Transzendentalphilosophie 10), pp. 118‚Äì121.  Prejudice  Rethinking Prejudice (2000) Rethinking Prejudice (2000, reissued 2019) examines the Enlightenment‚Äôs struggle against prejudicesSetting prejudice against experience, in particular, misses the point. ‚ÄúAs Andreas Dorschel has pointed out in this context, language itself, necessary to articulate experience even to ourselves, is saturated with prejudice‚Äù (Martin Kagel, A Blank Slate. In: Publications of the English Goethe Society 79 (2010), no. 2, pp. 79‚Äì94, p. 92). and the Counter- Enlightenment‚Äôs partisanship in favour of them. ‚ÄúDorschel wants to subvert that controversy by way of refuting an assumption shared by both parties‚Äù (‚ÄúDorschel will diesen Streit unterlaufen, indem er eine von beiden geteilte Annahme widerlegt‚Äù),Richard Raatzsch, √úber Wesen und Wert der Vorurteile. In: Deutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr Philosophie 50 (2002), no. 4, pp. 646‚Äì653, p. 652. to wit, that prejudices are bad or good, false or true because they are prejudices.Manfred Geier, Vorurteilchenphysik. In: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung 57, no. 178 (4/5 August 2001), p. V. Geier praises the acumen (‚ÄúScharfsinn‚Äù) of Dorschel‚Äôs enquiry. As Richard Raatzsch puts it, Dorschel ‚Äúseeks out the common source of both parties‚Äô errors through rendering each position as strong as possible‚Äù (‚Äúden gemeinsamen Quellen der Irrt√ºmer beider Seiten nachgeht, indem er sie so plausibel wie m√∂glich zu machen sucht‚Äù).Richard Raatzsch, √úber Wesen und Wert der Vorurteile.

Prejudices, Dorschel concludes, can be true or false, intelligent or stupid, wise or foolish, positive or negative, good or bad, racist or humanist ‚Äì and they possess none of these features simply qua prejudices.Andreas Dorschel, Rethinking Prejudice. Ashgate, Aldershot (UK) ‚Äì Burlington (USA) ‚Äì Singapore ‚Äì Sydney 2000, p. xii. Cf., following Dorschel, John Arthur, Race, Equality, and the Burdens of History. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge ‚Äì New York, NY, pp. 28‚Äì29. The conclusion‚Äôs significance derives from the fact that it is part and parcel of ‚Äúan account which preserves something of the common-sense notion of prejudice, rather than an abstract list of necessary and sufficient conditions that risks neglecting what people have historically meant and continue to mean by the term.‚ÄùMatthew Ratcliffe, Rethinking Prejudice by Andreas Dorschel. In: Philosophical Books 43 (2002), no. 2, pp. 156‚Äì157, p. 156.  Design  In Gestaltung ‚Äì Zur √Ñsthetik des Brauchbaren [Design ‚Äì The Aesthetics of Useful Things] (2002), Dorschel probes different ways of assessing artefacts.In exemplary fashion, Dorschel takes up the issue once more in Ein Bett gestalten. In: Deutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr Philosophie 68 (2020), no. 3, pp. 439‚Äì450. He ‚Äúobserved that ‚Äòthe concepts of the useful and [of] purpose have been replaced in the philosophy of design by that of function‚Äô‚Äù, Ute Poerschke states in a dense summary of the monograph.Ute Poerschke, Architectural Theory of Modernism: Relating Functions and Forms. Routledge, London ‚Äì New York, NY 2016, p. 22, referring to Andreas Dorschel, Gestaltung ‚Äì Zur √Ñsthetik des Brauchbaren. 1st ed., Universit√§tsverlag C. Winter, Heidelberg 2002 (Beitr√§ge zur Philosophie, Neue Folge), p. 38. ‚ÄòFunction‚Äô seemed to maintain the older meaning, but covered a bias towards technology. ‚ÄúThe question of ‚Äòhow‚Äô (how does this machine function?) replaced the question of ‚Äòwhat‚Äô (for what purpose?). Purpose embodies the question of ‚Äòwhat‚Äô; technology the question of ‚Äòhow‚Äô. Dorschel criticized that function has a diffuse meaning, under which one could understand both purpose and technology and concluded that because of this diffuse meaning it is advisable to consider ‚Äònot function, as modern functionalism did, but rather purpose and technology as the basic concepts of a theory of design‚Äô.‚ÄùUte Poerschke, Architectural Theory of Modernism: Relating Functions and Forms.

Mythologische Ansichten, technologische Absichten [Mutation. Mythological Views, Technological Purposes] (2009) represents a philosophical history of the idea of metamorphosis ‚Äì ‚Äúshaded in many nuances‚Äù.Wolfgang Sandberger, Identit√§t, Stabilit√§t und Historizit√§t. In: Musik-Konzepte N.F. XII/2011, pp. 73‚Äì89, p. 82: ‚Äúin vielen Schattierungen abgestuft‚Äù; cf. p. 87. Metamorphosis, Dorschel points out, defies analysis in terms of change. Change is supposed to be a rational pattern: A thing remains what it is while its features alter. But where does a thing cease to be that thing, where do its features commence? Whatever were that thing devoid of its features? Hence, historically, the concept of change was shadowed by the idea of metamorphosis or mutation. Dorschel highlights this idea, setting forth ‚Äì in four case studies ‚Äì the character of metamorphosis in Graeco-Roman mythology, in the New Testament, in modern alchemy, and, finally, in current genetic engineering and synthetic biology.  Ideas  In his 2010 volume Ideengeschichte [History of Ideas], Dorschel explains key issues of method in his research fields.Cf. Tim-Florian Goslar, Andreas Dorschel: Ideengeschichte. In: diskurs 8 (2012), no. 2, pp. 154‚Äì159. New ideas are invented in response to difficulties, obstacles or perplexities; from the latter, Dorschel suggests, historians can make sense of the former.Klaus Ridder, Literaturwissenschaftliche Ideen- und Problemgeschichte.

In: James Tully (ed.), Meaning and Context: Quentin Skinner and his Critics. Polity Press, Cambridge 1988, pp. 29‚Äì67, p. 64. Skinner himself deviated from his orthodoxy in Ambrogio Lorenzetti: The Artist as Political Philosopher. In: Proceedings of the British Academy 72 (1986), pp. 1‚Äì56. Dorschel asserts: ‚ÄúWords are just one medium of ideas among others; musicians conceive their products in tones, architects in spaces, painters in form and colour, mathematicians in numbers or, on a more abstract level, in functions‚Äù (‚ÄúWorte sind nur ein Medium von Ideen unter anderen; Musiker denken in T√∂nen, Architekten in R√§umen, Maler in Formen und Farben, Mathematiker in Zahlen oder, abstrakter, in Funktionen.‚Äù).Andreas Dorschel, Ideengeschichte.

In a way that breaks new ground, Dorschel proposes, as Eberhard H√ºppe points out, to analyse ideas not just in terms of time, but also in terms of space.Eberhard H√ºppe, Urbanisierte Musik. Eine Studie √ºber gesellschaftliche Determinanten musikalischer Raumproduktion. Westf√§lische Wilhelms-Universit√§t, M√ºnster 2012 (Wissenschaftliche Schriften der WWU M√ºnster XVIII/2), p. 103. Cf. Andreas Dorschel, Ideengeschichte. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 2010, pp. 23‚Äì24, 26‚Äì29, 43, 47, 50, 73-75, 82, 89‚Äì90, 111, 136‚Äì137, 149, 151, 179, 184, 198.  Retrieving philosophical genres  Dorschel has taken a critical stance towards a blinkered academicism in philosophy.Cf., for instance, his objections to a \\"bureaucratic\\" (\\"b√ºrokratisch\\") manner of reasoning in his essay Ins Unklare. In: Merkur 72 (2018), no. 5, pp. 83‚Äì91, specifically pp. 87‚Äì89. He considers the narrowing-down of philosophical writing to articles and monographs a drain especially on epistemology, ethics and aesthetics. The now conventional forms of exposition leave little room for presenting a position while, as the argument develops, keeping various degrees of distance from the position presented. To that purpose, tapping richer resources of (dramatic and epic) irony as well as a heuristic of fiction, Dorschel has revived a number of genres such as the letter, dialogue, monologue and philosophical tale (‚Äòconte philosophique‚Äô) that had flourished during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment,Cf. Robert Black, The Philosopher and Renaissance Culture. In: The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Philosophy, ed. James Hankins, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2007, pp. 13‚Äì29, p. 26; St√©phane van Damme, Philosophe/Philosopher. In: The Cambridge Companion to the French Enlightenment, ed. Daniel Brewer, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2014, pp. 153‚Äì166, p. 158; on the connection, see George Huppert, The Style of Paris: Renaissance Origins of the French Enlightenment. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Ind. 1999 but fell out of favour with modern academic philosophers.An influential plea for an exclusion of such forms from philosophy ‚Äúin the professional sense‚Äù was launched by Willard Van Orman Quine in Theories and Things. Belknap Harvard, Cambridge Mass. 1981, p. 192. In ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù discourse, authorial voice is supposed to be unambiguous; wherever multiple voices enter, this is seen as a threat.

In: Variations 23 (2015), pp. 167‚Äì175In terms of the theory of speech acts, Dorschel argues ‚Äúthat curses ever oscillate between the illocutionary and the perlocutionary. Someone who curses does not just voice words that represent items in the world, Andreas Dorschel points out; the curse is itself an ‚Äòitem‚Äô in the world that is meant to hit the person cursed like a missile. In order to hit, the missile must have been triggered from the position of a sovereign ‚Äì and it is the curse that lends itself to such empowerment, rendering the shooter sovereign.‚Äù Georg Mein, Aporien von Eid und Fluch: Unm√∂gliche Versprechen in Goethes ‚ÄòFaust‚Äô.

He unseated Democratic Representative Ken Yarbrough in the general election held on November 5, 2002. Bohac lost two previous challenges to Yarborough in the 1990s. Early life A resident of his district, Bohac was born in northwest Houston and attended Scarborough High School. After graduation, he went on to Houston Community College and Texas A&M; University at College Station, at which he earned at Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science in 1989 and a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing in 1990. Legislative career Many of Bohac's legislative initiatives have been oriented around law-enforcement and small business incentives. In April 2012, he was named \\"Best of the House\\" by the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas (CLEAT) and the \\"Taxpayers Best Friend\\" by the Texas House and was instrumental in the dedication of the Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway. At the close of the 2012 season, Bohac introduced his \\"Merry Christmas Bill\\" in response to his son's school removing the word \\"Christmas\\" from all of its holiday activities. Despite the Democratic sweep of Harris County in the general election held on November 6, 2018, Bohac secured his ninth term by 72 votes. With 24,194 votes (50.3 percent) he defeated Democrat Adam Milasincic, who polled 24,122 (49.9 percent). A write-in candidate held another 20 votes (0.04 percent).

Early life Michael Lowery Gillette was born in San Antonio but grew up in Baytown, Texas, where his father, Robert L. Gillette, practiced law. His mother, Sue Alexander Gillette, was a housewife and volunteer. In 1964, Gillette enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a B.A. in government in 1968 and a Ph.D. in history in 1984. His campus activities included the Tejas Club, the Silver Spurs, the Friar Society, the varsity debate team, and the Texas- Chilean Leadership Student Exchange Program. After completing his undergraduate studies, Gillette served as a VISTA Volunteer for two years, working with a Model Cities program in Worcester, Massachusetts. Career While enrolled in graduate school, Gillette joined the staff of the LBJ Presidential Library in January 1972. He began recording oral history interviews for the Library the following year and was appointed Chief of Oral History and Acquisitions in 1976. During his two decades at the LBJ Library, Gillette conducted more than 600 oral history interviews with people associated with Johnson, including Lady Bird Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Russell Long, Sargent Shriver, Lawrence F. O'Brien, Joseph A. Califano, Jr., Ellsworth Bunker, and Mary Lasker. During the period, 1989‚Äì1991, Gillette also recorded more than 400 interviews on the 1988 presidential election for the LBJ School of Public Affairs. In 1991, Gillette was selected to serve as the Director of the Center for Legislative Archives at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. For 12 years, Gillette administered the historical records of the United States Senate and the House of Representatives in the Archives. He oversaw the development of traveling exhibitions and education resources using historic documents. These projects included the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson, 1801‚Äì1809 and Our Mothers Before Us, which was based on women's petitions to Congress before the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Gillette was also instrumental in the creation of the Foundation for the National Archives and served as the agency's liaison to the foundation from 1992 to 1997. Upon his retirement from the Archives in 2003, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution expressing gratitude for his dedication to preserving and promoting the records of Congress. The House of Representatives presented him with the gavel that the Speaker had used to convene the 107th Congress. In 2003, Gillette returned to Austin as the Executive Director of Humanities Texas, the state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities. This statewide non- profit educational organization works with local schools, libraries, and museums to advance the humanities disciplines thought grants, publications, and traveling exhibitions. In December 2006, Humanities Texas purchased the century-old Byrne-Reed House as its headquarters. The building's restoration was completed in 2010. The Byrne-Reed House has won 11 architectural awards. Gillette's books include Launching the War on Poverty: An Oral History and Lady Bird Johnson: An Oral History, which was released in November 2012, and featured on The Diane Rehm Show and C-SPAN.

Although he attempted to obtain the Donatary captaincy of the island, he and his progenitors were the origin of many of the families of the island. Early life Born in Montemor-o- Novo,Although many historians, including the humanist Gaspar Frutuoso, suggest that he was born in Montemor-o-Velho, recent documents suggest that he was born in Montemor-o-NovoAnt√≥nio Ornelas Mendes and Jorge Forjaxz (2007) the son of Gil Sodr√© and nephew of the English nobleman John de SudleyS√©rgio Sodr√© de Castro (January‚ÄìDecember 1987‚Äì1988), p.133-137. (transliterated to Jo√£o de Sodr√©, where Sodr√© was corrupted from the English Sudeley or Sudley. John Sudley was a descendant of William le Boteler, which explains the commonality of his coat-of-arms in England and Portugal, between the Boteler (Butler) and Sodr√© families.Francisco Ant√¥nio Doria (2000), p.250 Marriage Vasco Gil Sodr√© was married twice: first to Iria Vaz do Couto, daughter of Duarte Barreto do Couto, the first Donatary captain of Graciosa; and the second to Beatriz Gon√ßalves da Silva, who accompanied him to the island. He had one daughter named Isabel (Sodre). Beatriz Gon√ßalves da Silva was referred to, by Gaspar Frutuoso, as Beatriz Gon√ßalves de Bectaforte, native of the castle of Bectaforte in England, which is a confusion arising from later descendants of Vasco Gil Sodr√©.Ant√≥nio Ornelas Mendes e Jorge Forjaz, op. cit. From this marriage, he had Diogo Vaz Sodr√©, Fern√£o Vaz Sodr√©, M√©cia Vaz, Leonor Vaz and In√™s Vaz, as well as others, comprising ten children, that were the progenitors of the island of Graciosa.Gaspar Frutuoso Saudadades da Terra, Livro 6, Cap√≠tulo 42 Duarte Barreto do Couto, brother of his first wife, was married to Ant√≥nia Sodr√©, making them double in-laws. Although there are few record, Duarte Barreto do Couto, more commonly known as Duarte Barreto, noble of the Algarve, was Donatary captain of the southern part of the island, which was later incorporated into the territory of the captaincy of Graciosa. Graciosa Vasco Gil Sodr√© came to Graciosa following the mysterious disappearance of Duarte Barreto do Couto, who died during a Castilian incursion into Graciosa (probably in 1475, during the War of the Castilian Succession).F√©lix Jos√© da Costa (2007) Becoming a widow, and alone on the island, Ant√≥nia Sodr√© wrote to her brother, so that he could come to stay with her. Responding to her invitation, Vasco Gil Sodr√© came to Graciosa, after a stopping at several north African settlements, arriving at a time in which Portugal was at war with the Crown of Castile, owing to the pretensions Joanna la Beltraneja, between 1475 and 1479. Gil Sodr√© was accompanied by Beatriz Gon√ßalves da Silva, and a group of servants, arriving in Graciosa after staying in Terceira.Lu√≠s Conde Pimentel (1986) The family erected a house in Carapacho, a place near to their lands in the southwest of the island, in what is today Praia. Vasco Gil Sodr√© attempted to obtain the Donatary captaincy of the island, including the construction of a customs-house on his part, the captaincy of the north (centered on Santa Cruz da Graciosa) was given to Pedro Correia da Cunha (brother-in-law of Christopher Columbus, who arrived on the island from Porto Santo, after losing the captaincy, in 1474. Despite the efforts of the Sodr√© family, in 1485 Pedro Correia da Cunha was confirmed as Donatary Captain for the entire island, owing to the fact that the \\"land was too small for two divisions\\", effectively impeding Vasco Gil Sodr√© and his descendants from obtaining the captaincy they claimed. This decision definitively unified the captaincy of Graciosa, until the Donatary system was abolished. The division resulted in the two municipalities on the island (Praia da Graciosa and Santa Cruz da Graciosa), later unified in 186]. Vasco died at Santa Cruz da Graciosa.

It is associated with a New Year's Day custom involving sprinkling people with water newly drawn from a well. The song was set to music by Benjamin Britten in 1934. Lyrics As with any traditional folk song, there are a number of variations. One standard form appeared in Walter de la Mare's Tom Tiddler's Ground (1931), an anthology of verse for children. His version goes: Benjamin Britten set the De la Mare version of the song to music as \\"A New Year Carol\\" in 1934.Evans, John. Journeying Boy: The Diaries of the Young Benjamin Britten 1928‚Äì1938. London, Faber and Faber (2009): pp. 210-11 The text of the song is attested as early as 1849, in form substantially identical to De la Mare's text. Traditions The song is associated with Pembrokeshire. There, the song figured in a custom in which, on New Year's Day, children collect fresh water from a well, and go around with a sprig from an evergreen tree, which they use to sprinkle the faces of passers-by with the water while singing the carol and begging for gifts of food or money. Elsewhere in Wales, the custom is called , \\"new water\\", and the water was also used to lustrate rooms and doors of houses. This ceremony has a parallel in the Scottish Hogmanay tradition of saining; here water drawn from a \\"dead and living ford\\", a ford crossed by both the living and the dead, is sprinkled through the house, and then juniper branches are burnt for the smoke indoors. The purpose of the rite is to sain, or purify, the house for the new year. Interpretations Llanllawer Holy Well, an ancient spring at Cwm Gwaun, Pembrokeshire According to Trefor Owen, the song preserves \\"an early well-cult made acceptable to medieval Christianity by its association with the Virgin and perpetuated both by the desire to wish one's neighbor well at the beginning of a new year and by the small monetary payment involved.\\" Similar speculations from the nineteenth century have sought to link the mysterious maidens of the song with the goddess Aurora, bearing the gold of the rising and setting sun on her head and feet. The meaning of the words \\"levy-dew\\" in the original lyrics of the song is not certainly known. One line of speculation holds that the words represent the Welsh phrase llef y Dduw, \\"a cry to God\\". Others connect it to Middle English (\\"lady\\"), or to the French phrase levez √† Dieu, \\"raise to God\\", which may in turn refer to the elevation of the Host in Christian liturgy. Waterson‚ÄìCarthy performed the song on their 2006 recording Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man. The chorus in this recording begins \\"Residue, sing Residue\\"; Martin Carthy's liner notes credit the \\"Residue\\" variant to Bert Hodgeson, and observe that \\"None of us can figure out the possible significance of the 'Residue sing Residue' chorus and neither could Bert ‚Äì or whoever it was ‚Äì but that was, he said, what was sung to him.\\" The Waterson-Carthy performance leaves out the stanza related to the water ritual, and adds two original verses in which the new year is welcomed through the south gate and the old year shooed from the north gate.

She was also the mother of the woman after whom Benicia, California was named and the grandmother of Romualdo Pacheco, the 12th governor of California.  Biography  Ygnacia was born to Juan Francisco Lopez and Maria Feliciana Arballo on January 31, 1793 and baptized Maria Ygnacia de la Candalaria Lopez. She was baptized in the chapel of the Presidio of San Diego. Her father was a soldier of the guard in San Gabriel. Her mother was a mulatta who had accompanied the Anza Expedition as far as San Gabriel. Her father died when she was 7. On September 3, 1809, Ygnacia married Joaquin Victor Carrillo, a soldier from Baja California. With Joaquin, she had thirteen children, twelve of whom survived to adulthood. Several went on to play notable roles in the early history of California. In 1821, Francisco Mar√≠a Ruiz, comandante of the Presidio of San Diego, built the family an adobe residence on the flats below the Presidio, where they lived for more than a decade. A portion of the Ruiz adobe, designated \\"Casa de Carrillo\\", still stands. After Joaquin's death circa 1836, Ygnacia and her nine unmarried children traveled north by ox-cart over to Sonoma, where they stayed with her son-in-law Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. In 1838, Ygnacia got Vallejo's permission to settle in an area north of Sonoma, along Santa Rosa Creek. Her sons, with help from native people and her son-in-law Salvador, built a large adobe, now known as Carrillo Adobe, near the creek. In 1841, Governor pro tem Manuel Jimeno confirmed her possession by granting her of land, designated as the Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa. It was one of only a handful of California land grants made to a single woman. Ygnacia supervised the farming on her rancho, where wheat, barley, oats, corn, beans, peas, lentils, watermelons, and muskmelons were grown. Her son Ramon managed her livestock, which included 1,500 horses, 3,000 cattle, and sheep. She became fluent in the language of the native people. During the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846, her son Julio and two of her sons-in-law were imprisoned at Sutter's Fort. The rancho's livestock, weapons, and provisions were confiscated. In 1849, a year after Mexico ceded California to the United States, Ygnacia died. Her remains were interred in the chapel of the Mission San Francisco de Solano in Sonoma.  Carrillo Adobe  A Franciscan outpost named Assistencia Santa Rosa de Lima was begun on the site in sometime around 1829, but the project was abandoned due to secularization. After Ygnacia's death, her son-in-law David Mallagh established a trading post and tavern in the adobe. Santa Rosa's first post office was located in the adobe. The trading business continued under various owners into the 1860s. The land passed to Gustav Hahman, who turned it into an orchard. In 1950, Archbishop John Joseph Mitty purchased the land for building the Cathedral of Saint Eugene and its associated school. The Diocese of Santa Rosa erected a chain- link fence around the ruins and made plans to restore the adobe, but these plans never came to fruition. When surveyed in 1962, all that remained of the adobe was a three-room structure, by with a veranda on all sides. In 2005, the City of Santa Rosa gave tentative approval for a developer's plan to build up to 165 units on the parcel and spend more than $300,000 to prevent further deterioration of the adobe itself. Archeological investigations in 2006 revealed that the adobe was built on sturdy stone footings. In 2012, vandals broke through the fence and stole some posts and beams, which were later found in a nearby encampment. Sheltered by a metal-roofed pole structure, the ruins of Carillo Adobe are still visible at behind the Cathedral of Saint Eugene, near the intersection of Montgomery Drive and Franquette Avenue in Santa Rosa.

It is the sequel to The Snowman, and was created to mark the 30th anniversary of the original short film. The Snowman and The Snowdog is dedicated to John Coates (the film's producer, who died in September 2012) and features a new song called \\"Light the Night\\" by former Razorlight drummer Andy Burrows. The Snowman and the Snowdog won the Televisual Bulldog Award 2013 in the Best Children's category. Plot The story begins similarly to The Snowman, at the house where James, the boy from The Snowman, used to live. Once in the open countryside, it is now in a housing estate. One sunny Summer's day, a young boy named Billy and his mother arrive at the house, which they have just moved into. Billy helps his elderly dog from the removal van and they enter the property. As autumn arrives, it becomes apparent that Billy's dog has died and the family bury him in the back garden. With Christmas approaching, Billy writes to Father Christmas in the form of a hand-drawn picture; the one and only thing he asks for is another dog to replace his deceased one. He then stumbles over a loose floorboard in his bedroom where he discovers some toys and a small box tied with tinsel beneath it. In the box, he finds a photograph of James and the Snowman, as well as the original scarf, hat, coal lumps and an old dried-up tangerine (once the Snowman's nose). As Billy realises his discovery, he peers out of the bedroom window and sees that it has begun to snow. He rushes out to build a snowman as in the photograph, but after barely completing his lower body he realises that not enough snow has fallen to complete the task, having already used all the snow in the garden. He hurriedly runs around the yard salvaging every bit of snow he can find off fences and a shed's roof and suchlike. Adding the final touches to his creation he decides that the original dried tangerine is long past its usefulness so, discarding it in the garden, he claims a fresh one from a fruit bowl in the kitchen. He finally completes the Snowman and in memory of his own dog uses the remaining snow to build a little snowdog, next to the Snowman, with mismatching socks on sticks for ears, gloves for spots and the discarded tangerine for a nose. Night time approaches, and Billy goes to bed and drifts off to sleep. As midnight arrives, he is awoken by a dog barking in the back garden. Billy looks out of his bedroom window, and is astonished to notice the Snowdog waggling an ear at him. As Billy rushes downstairs, he finds, to his surprise, that they have miraculously came to life. The Snowdog, sniffing around in the snow, uncovers the ball that had once belonged to Billy's old dog and starts to play with it. The ball bounces into the house and the Snowman and the Snowdog enter it. The Snowman sees the photo of James and his former self on the fridge and smiles. Before too long Billy realises that the Snowdog has started to melt after sitting too close to the fireplace in the kitchen. They then head back outside and explores the garden shed where the motorbike, which the Snowman rode in the first film, can still be seen along with some other mementos from James' family home. Not long after, the three are off into the open air to visit the annual snowman party in the frozen north. However, while flying, the Snowman loses his nose, and as they land to search for it, they come across an old-style red single-engined light plane with open cockpit that they use for the rest of their journey. During the flying sequence, as in the original, a number of famous English landmarks can be seen, such as The Shard, London Eye, Big Ben, The Gherkin and the Crystal Palace transmitting station, as the three of them fly over London. When the Snowman, the Snowdog and Billy reach the gathering, the party is in full swing with many familiar faces from the original. During the partying the three of them decide to enter a downhill race against numerous snowmen competitors and a rather determined and skilled skiing penguin. As they descend the course, however, many of the participating snowmen, including the protagonist snowman, end up embedded in snow drifts, but Billy and the Snowdog manage to stay hot on the penguin's tail, and the duo win the race, to be congratulated on their victory by Father Christmas himself. As the sun starts to rise, and the Snowman signals their departure, another snowman finds Billy's letter and whispers into Father Christmas's ear. From his sleigh, Father Christmas reveals a small present which he gives to Billy. While another snowman flies the aeroplane back to where it came from, Billy, the Snowman and the Snowdog return home by flying. Upon arriving home, Billy opens his present- a dog collar, which he places round the Snowdog's neck where it then turns into a real live dog that matches the one that Billy asked for. They both say goodbye to the Snowman and head inside the house The next morning, Billy awakes to find his bed empty, and worriedly searches for the dog. His search ends in the kitchen, where his dog is trying to get outside. As the two go out into the back garden together, they discover that the Snowman has melted for the second time. Beside the melted snow, the dog, which Billy calls 'Socks', places his new ball, and the two kneel together upset about the Snowman's disappearance, like in the original 1982 film. Production The 24-minute film, taking nearly two years to complete, cost ¬£2 million to produce and, like the original movie, was created from over 200,000 hand drawn images. While the film was primarily hand drawn, CGI was used to add digital falling snow and lighting effects. The composer Howard Blake, who composed the soundtrack to the original 1982 film was one of the few crew members not asked to return and after expressing an interest in returning was allegedly asked to \\"send a demo\\", which he refused citing the success of the original orchestral production score. The film instead features a largely pop-music orientated soundtrack featuring the songs Light the Night (flying to the north pole scenes) and Home Town (returning home scenes) by former Razorlight drummer Andy Burrows plus incidental music by Ilan Eshkeri. Drawing by hand was a laborious process that employed a crew of 94, 77 of whom were artists and animators. Each second of the film was made up of 12 animated frames, each taking up to 30 hours to complete. Reluctant to have the original The Snowman produced into a short film, Raymond Briggs was quoted to have said that \\"it took a lot of persuasion to allow the sequel to be made.\\" Although Briggs was not himself responsible for the story of the new animation, the sequel could not have taken place without his permission as he owns the rights to the original characters and premise. Promotion The Snowman and the Snowdog was heavily promoted in the weeks leading to its original broadcast, mostly by Channel 4, but also by other companies such as Nationwide. An official video game based on the film's flying sequence was released for iOS and Android devices. A novelisation of the story is available as an e-book from both Apple's iBookstore service and Amazon's Kindle store. Also, the soundtrack for the film, featuring the theme song \\"Light the Night\\", is available digitally from iTunes and Amazon and a single version of \\"Light the Night\\" is available from both iTunes and the Google Play Music store. The film was released on home media on 3 November 2013, as a DVD, Blu-ray or a double pack with the original film. The soundtrack was released on CD format around the same time. Reception When the film was broadcast on Channel 4, on 24 December 2012, it drew nearly six million viewers: one of the channel's highest of the year and their biggest audience on Christmas Eve for more than a decade. Writing in The Guardian, Sam Wollaston praised the animation, but criticised the numerous similarities to the original plot. Video game A smartphone game was released by Channel 4 on 9 December 2012 for iOS and Android. The game was developed by Crash Lab. It reached number 1 in the iPhone and iPad game charts and was downloaded over 1 million times in the UK and Ireland. Popular culture In November 2016, a Christmas advert for British clothing company Barbour featured an older Billy and his dog reuniting with the Snowman and reminiscing about meeting Father Christmas. In November 2017, Barbour released another Christmas advert, following on from the previous one in 2016. A series of public art trails have been created, featuring outsize versions of the Snowdog, along with smaller Snowpups. To date, they've appeared in Newcastle and Tyne and Wear, Brighton and Hove, Cardiff and Ashford. After each exhibition the Snowdogs are sold at auction, with the proceeds going to local hospices.
