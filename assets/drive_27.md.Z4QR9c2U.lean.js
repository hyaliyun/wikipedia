The organisation was founded in 1884 and has been based in Plymouth since the Citadel Hill Laboratory was opened on 30 June 1888. The MBA is also home to the National Marine Biological Library, whose collections cover the marine biological sciences, and curates the Historical Collections. Throughout its history, the MBA has had a Royal Patron. The current patron of the MBA is H.R.H. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. In 2013, the MBA was granted a Royal Charter in recognition of the MBA's scientific preeminence in its field. Origins and foundation Royal Citadel on Plymouth Hoe. In 1866 the Royal Commission on the Sea Fisheries, which included among its officers Professor Thomas Henry Huxley, had reported that fears of over-exploitation of the sea fisheries were unfounded.J. Caird, T. H. Huxley & G. S. Lefevre (1866) Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Enquire into the Sea Fisheries of the United Kingdom. London HMSO, Vol. I, 108 pp. They recommended removing existing laws regulating fishing grounds and closed seasons. However, the increase in the size and number of fishing vessels was causing widespread concern, and there were reports from all around the UK coasts about the scarcity of particular fish. This concern was expressed at the International Fisheries Exhibition in London in 1883, a conference called to discuss the commercial and scientific aspects of the fishing industry, and which was attended by many leading scientists of the day. Nevertheless, in his opening address,T. H. Huxley (1884) Inaugural address. International Fisheries Exhibition, 1883, Literature, 4, 1-19. Huxley discounted reports of fish scarcities and repeated the views of the Royal Commission of 1866. He stated that with existing methods of fishing, it was inconceivable that the great sea fisheries, such as those for cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and mackerel (Scomber scombrus), could ever be exhausted. Many of the representatives of science and commerce present had different views to Huxley. Their views were put forward by E. Ray Lankester, who summed up the scientific contributions in an essay on what we would now call ecology. He pointed out that \\"it is a mistake to suppose that the place of fish removed from a particular fishing ground is immediately taken by some of the grand total of fish, which are so numerous in comparison with man's depredations as to make his operations in this respect insignificant...there is on the contrary evidence that shoal fish, like herrings, mackerel and pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), and ground-fish, such as soles and other flat-fishes, are really localised. If man removes a large proportion of these fish from the areas which they inhabit, the natural balance is upset and chiefly in so far as the production of young fish is concerned.\\"E. R. Lankester (1884) The scientific results of the exhibition. International Fisheries Exhibition, 1883, Literature, 4, 443-446. During this masterly address he went on to develop this theme and concluded with an appeal for the formation of a society to foster the study of marine life, both for its scientific interest and because of the need to know more about the life histories and habitats of food fishes. Professor Lankester envisaged that such a society would construct a laboratory close to the coast, with the building containing aquaria and apparatus for the circulation of seawater and, most importantly, laboratory accommodation for scientists. The appeal was answered by a group of eminent scientists, who resolved to form a society and build a laboratory on the British coast. =Founders= The Committee formed at the International Fisheries Exhibition 1883 resolved to take action to establish a British Marine Laboratory, an initiative that ultimately led to the formation of the Marine Biological Association and building of the Laboratory in Plymouth.

Wilson Past and current research  The MBA has a world- leading reputation for marine biological research, with some twelve Nobel laureates having been or being associated with it over the course of their career. Among them, A. V. Hill received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1922 \\"for his discovery relating to the production of heat in the muscle\\". The discovery of the mechanism of nerve impulses (action potentials) in animals was made at the Laboratory in Plymouth by Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley, work for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1963. The MBA publishes the Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. A public aquarium operated by the association was transferred to the new National Marine Aquarium at Sutton Harbour in 1998. The current MBA Research Programme includes work on molecular and cell biology, physiology and ecology. A wide range of marine organisms are studied from microscopic organisms such as marine plankton and viruses and much larger species such as sharks and giant kelp. The objective of this research is to increase understanding of the structure and function of marine ecosystems. The association's research is led by a number of Research Fellows who each run an interdisciplinary group which collaborates with other organisations as well as obtaining funding for their work. The groundbreaking work of MBA research scientists has been recognised by many national and international awards over the years, including the Royal Society's Royal Medal, Darwin Medal and Croonian Lecture, the Zoological Society of London's Frink Medal, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science's International Prize for Biology. Long-term science observations of physical and biological parameters in the ocean have been collected by the MBA for over 100 years providing a foundation of data supporting studies aimed at understanding biological responses to marine environmental changes including effects of climate change. National Marine Biological Library The National Marine Biological Library (NMBL) began in 1887 as the research support library for the MBA. Today, it provides research support for the MBA, the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. The NMBL's holdings include periodicals, serials, journals, reports and grey literature, a large collection of historical and modern books, an extensive reprint collection, and expedition reports. These cover the vast majority of the world. The NMBL‚Äôs Special Collections include the research libraries of several eminent MBA scientists; these are George Parker Bidder, Edward Thomas Browne, Sidney Frederic Harmer, E. Ray Lankester, Marie Victoire Lebour and John Zachary Young. Additionally, the NMBL curates the MBA Archive Collection which details the MBA's institutional history as well the history of marine biology in Britain since the late-nineteenth century, especially through the collection‚Äôs personal papers. These include scientific papers and material from Walter Garstang, Sidney Harmer, Hildebrand Wolfe Harvey, Thomas Hincks, Thomas V. Hodgson, Stanley W. Kemp, Charles A. Kofoid, Mary Parke, John Richardson, Frederick S. Russell, Thomas A. Stephenson, Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, Edward A. Wilson and William Yarrell. Journal of the Marine Biological Association Since 1887, the MBA has published the Journal of the Marine Biological Association (JMBA), a scientific journal \\"publishing original research on all aspects of marine biology\\".

After applying Schreinemaker's Rules and creating a phase diagram, the resulting geometric figure will be thermodynamically accurate, although the axes will be undetermined. In order to determine the correct orientation of the geometric figure obtained through Schreinemaker's Rules, one must have additional information about the given reactions or go through an analytical treatment of the thermodynamics of the relevant phases. Metastable extensions Univariant lines are sometimes called reaction lines. The extension of a univariant line through the invariant point is called the metastable extension. Univariant lines are usually drawn as a solid line while their metastable extensions are drawn as a dotted line. Univariant lines and their metastable extensions are often labeled by putting in square brackets the phase that is absent from the reaction associated with the given univariant line. In other words, since every univariant line represents a chemical equilibrium, these equilibrium curves are named with the phase (or phases) that is not involved in the equilibrium. Take an example with four phases: A, B, C, D. If a univariant line is defined by the equilibrium reaction A+D‚Üê‚ÜíC, this univariant line would be labeled [B], because the phase B is absent from the reaction A+D‚Üê‚ÜíC. Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem The Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem states that for every univariant line that passes through the invariant point, one side is stable and the other is metastable. The invariant point marks the boundary of the stable and metastable segments of a reaction line. =Phase Rule= An invariant point is defined as a representation of an invariant system (0 degrees of freedom by Gibbs' phase rule) by a point on a phase diagram. A univariant line thus represents a univariant system with 1 degree of freedom. Two univariant lines can then define a divariant area with 2 degrees of freedom. =Metastable Extensions Rule= From the Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem, Schreinemaker's Rules can be determined. These rules can be used in the creation of an accurate phase diagram where both axes are intensive thermodynamic variables. There are many correct collections of \\"Schreinemaker's Rules\\" and the choice to use a given set of rules depends on the nature of the phase diagrams being created. Due to the phrasing of the Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem, only one rule is essential to the Schreinemaker's Rules. This is the so-called metastable extensions rule: > The metastable extension of the [phase-absent] reaction must fall in the > sector in which that phase is stable in all possible assemblages.Spear, > Frank S. Metamorphic Phase Equilibria and Pressure-Temperature-Time Paths. > Washington, D.C: Mineralogical Society of America, 1995. A generic phase diagram with unspecified axes; the invariant point is marked in red, metastable extensions labeled in blue, relevant reactions noted on stable ends of univariant lines. This rule is geometrically sound in the construction of phase diagrams since for every metastable reaction, there must be a phase that is relatively stable. This phase must be the one which does not participate in the reaction and is therefore not consumed as a reactant or formed as a product, thus being \\"stable.\\" Some collections of Schreinemaker's Rules will contain the following, additional, basic statements: * No assemblage has a stability area greater than 180¬∞. * All reactants and products are stable in the field where the reaction plots. * The absent phase is unstable where the reaction plots. * Complex reactions (high number of participating phases) usually lie within bounding, simple reactions defining the phase stability region. * The simplest divariant region usually contains the most metastable extensions. * If each stable and metastable reaction curve is labeled with the absent phase, then the order of the named curves as you proceed around the invariant point should cycle through all phases twice in order of their relative reaction components. Assemblages An assemblage is defined as the phases on one side of an equilibrium reaction. An assemblage can be either a single phase or a collection of phases. In the example above with the equilibrium reaction A+D‚Üê‚ÜíC, (A+D) is an assemblage as well as (C) on its own.

The women's doubles title was won by Svetlana Kuznetsova and Am√©lie Mauresmo who overcame Kvƒõta Peschke and Lisa Raymond in the final match. Tournament The 2009 Sony Ericsson Open was the 25th edition of the Miami Masters tournament and was held at Tennis Center at Crandon Park, Key Biscayne near Miami, Florida. The tournament was a joint event between the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and was part of the 2009 ATP World Tour and the 2009 WTA Tour calendars. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles events which were played on 12 Laykold Cushion Plus hard courts. The total prize money for the tournament was US$9,000,000 with $4,500,000 assigned equally to ATP and WTA events. Singles winners received $605,500 each and doubles winning teams received $225,000 each. The tournament was conducted from March 23 to April 5, with qualifying draws played on March 23‚Äì24 and main draws from March 25 to April 5. Both the men's and women's singles draws consisted of 96 players and the doubles draws consisted of 32 teams. The qualifying draw consisted of 43 men and 42 women who competed for 12 positions each in the men's and women's final draw. Players 47 of the top 50 players in the ATP rankings entered the men's singles event at the tournament with Rafael Nadal seeded first, followed by Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Defending champion Nikolay Davydenko withdrew ahead of the tournament due to a foot injury. Richard Gasquet, who was initially going to play, withdrew prior to his first match after suffering from right shoulder injury. Gasquet was replaced by lucky loser Bj√∂rn Phau. 12 players progressed from the qualifying draws to the main draw and six players, including Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis, were given wildcard entries. In the women's singles field, defending champion Serena Williams was top seeded, with number two Dinara Safina only 311 points behind her in the WTA rankings at the start of the tournament. Maria Sharapova was expected to return to singles tennis at this tournament after playing doubles matches in the previous tournament, the 2009 BNP Paribas Open. Sharapova, who had not played singles matches since August 2008, withdrew due to a continued lack of fitness. Jelena Dokiƒá, Sania Mirza and Alexa Glatch were among the eight players who received wildcard entries. 12 players progressed from qualifying draws to main draw. The doubles draws were led by defending champions Bob and Mike Bryan on the men's side and Cara Black and Liezel Huber on the women's side. Katarina Srebotnik, one of the women's doubles defending champions, had not recovered from an injury picked up in December 2008 and did not participate. Her partner from the previous year, Ai Sugiyama partnered with Russian Daniela Hantuchov√°. Marina Erakovic ‚Äì Sun Tiantian and Francesca Schiavone ‚Äì Chan Yung-jan withdrew from the tournament due to respective injuries to Erakovic and Chan. The doubles draws included five wildcard entries in total. EventsMen's singles= Novak Djokovic was the runner-up at the tournament. All the seeded players received a bye into the second round. Wildcards Marcos Baghdatis and Lleyton Hewitt were among the players progressing into the second round, while Germans Philipp Kohlschreiber and former World no. 2 Tommy Haas were the major upsets. Most seeded players continued their progress into the third round with eighth seed Fernando Verdasco winning his 200th ATP tour match in his career. Ivo Karloviƒá and David Nalbandian were among the seeded players defeated in second round. Lucky loser Bj√∂rn Phau was promoted into the third round after his opponent Albert Monta√±√©s suffered a hamstring injury during the second set of the match and was forced to withdraw. Frenchman Ga√´l Monfils took a hard- fought win over 22nd seed and former world number 1 Marat Safin in a third round match played for nearly three hours. Qualifier Taylor Dent continued his successful run by defeating Tommy Robredo in the third round. Czechs Tom√°≈° Berdych and Radek ≈†tƒõp√°nek overcame higher seeded players James Blake and Fernando Gonz√°lez en route to the fourth round. Top seed Rafael Nadal faced an uphill battle against Stanislas Wawrinka in the fourth round match, facing a tiebreak in each set and eventually defeating him. Second seed Roger Federer defeated Dent in the fourth round to set up a quarterfinal match with longtime rival Andy Roddick, who overcame Ga√´l Monfils in a two-set match. Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Juan Mart√≠n del Potro, Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga made it into the quarterfinals. Del Potro defeated Nadal in the three-set quarterfinal match to reach the first ATP Masters semifinal of his career. Del Potro took the final set on a tiebreak after losing the second set. Murray faced Verdasco in the second quarterfinal in a rematch of 2009 Australian Open fourth round. Verdasco suffered an injury in the second game of the match and had to be seen by his physio. He was not in good enough shape to compete with Murray and eventually lost. Federer defeated Roddick while Djokovic moved past Tsonga to advance to the semifinals. Djokovic rallied back to defeat Federer in the first semifinal after losing the first set. The third seed however kept his consistency in the next two sets and won them. Murray edged past del Potro in the second semifinal to enter his second straight Masters final. Murray faltered in the second set of the match conceding two service breaks. However he recovered in the final set, gaining an early break of serve, to win the match. Djokovic and Murray appeared in their seventh and fourth Masters final and 19th and 17th career finals respectively. Djokovic led the head-to-head tally against Murray, but Murray had won the last two encounters between them. In the match, Murray moved into a 4‚Äì0 lead in the first set. Djokovic improved his serve from that point but lost the set. A role reversal in the second set saw Djokovic move into a 4‚Äì1 lead. Murray fought back, however, to level the score to 5‚Äì5 and won the set to secure the victory. This was Murray's third title win of the season and eleventh of his career. It was also his third Masters win of the career. Murray credited his improved fitness for his win. Djokovic, who had struggled with excessive heat in the past, struggled once again to assimilate with the temperature. He admitted that he was impatient early in the match, which resulted in him making too many unforced errors. ;Final score Andy Murray defeated Novak Djokovic, 6‚Äì2, 7‚Äì5. =Women's singles= Victoria Azarenka won the third title of her career. All the seeded players received a bye into the second round. Seven seeded players were ousted from the second round including third seed Jelena Jankoviƒá, who was defeated by Gisela Dulko, and eighth seed Marion Bartoli, who lost to qualifier Anastasiya Yakimova. Second seed Dinara Safina, Vera Zvonareva and Ana Ivanovic were among the nine seeded players who were eliminated in the third round. Three times former champion and fifth seed Venus Williams faced stiff competition from Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska in fourth round. Williams lost the first set but prevailed in later sets to win the match. Li Na and Ekaterina Makarova also fought hard for a place in the quarterfinals, with Li coming out strong in the three set match, winning. Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Caroline Wozniacki in the first of the quarterfinals. Kuznetsova looked good to win the match in straight sets after building a big lead, however Wozniacki fought back to win the second set on a tiebreak. Kuznetsova ultimately won. Victoria Azarenka defeated Samantha Stosur in the second quarterfinal. Williams sisters Serena and Venus set up the second semifinal after defeating Li Na and Iveta Bene≈°ov√° respectively. The Williams sisters had met 19 times before their semifinal meeting, Venus leading the head-to-head tally 10‚Äì9. Serena won this time in a closely fought match. Azarenka came on top in the second semifinal defeating Kuznetsova. Serena and Azarenka met in their careers' 46th and seventh career finals respectively, with Serena appearing in her third consecutive final at the event, having won on the last two occasions. Azarenka dominated the final match, as Serena was playing while nursing a leg injury. Azarenka won the match, securing third title of her career. Azarenka stated that she was very nervous in the final game of the match and described her win as \\"the biggest moment in [her] career\\". Serena mentioned that it was difficult for her to move to the left, but she still played with maximum effort. ;Final score Victoria Azarenka defeated Serena Williams, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì1. =Men's doubles= Four seeded teams were eliminated in the first round of the event. Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjiƒá were the highest ranked team to lose, falling to Nicol√°s Almagro and David Ferrer, along with third seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles, who lost to French duo Julien Benneteau and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Bennetau and Tsonga continued their progress into the third round defeating Rik de Voest and Bobby Reynolds. They were joined by Julian Knowle and J√ºrgen Melzer, who triumphed over Almagro and Ferrer. Only two seeded teams, those of Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan and of Bruno Soares and Kevin Ullyett, made it into the quarterfinals, and faced each other in that round. The Bryan brothers, who were the defending champions, overcame Soares and Ullyett in a two-set match. Ashley Fisher and Stephen Huss, Knowle and Melzer and Max Mirnyi and Andy Ram were the other teams who made it into the semifinals. The Bryan brothers faced Fisher and Huss in the first semifinal and lost, ending their streak of winning 13 consecutive matches. Mirnyi and Ram encountered much harder competition against Knowle and Melzer and saved five match points before winning.

Kevin MacKeown: ‚ÄúThe Hong Kong Mint 1864‚Äì1868‚Äù, in: Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch, vol 47, 2007 Tutored by his father, Claude later studied railway engineering in St. Petersburg before obtaining his first professional appointment as an assistant engineer with Imperial Japanese Railways in 1873. Forced to leave Japan because of civil war in 1878 he moved to Shanghai where he met Tong King-sing who appointed him as an engineer with the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company at Tangshan near to the ancient walled city of Kaiping. Kinder's initial brief was to help with the sinking of coal mine shafts at the new colliery and to construct a railway from the mines to the nearest navigable river. Chinese politics initially prevented the building of this railway and in consequence Kinder surveyed and built a canal for coal barges to operate between the river at Lutai and Hsukochuang (Xugezhuang) from where a short tramway was constructed to Tangshan.P.H. Kent: ‚ÄúRailway Enterprise in China‚Äù, London 1907 The government authority for the tramway had intended that only mules were to be used for hauling coal wagons but Kinder (with Tong King Sing's connivance) secretly constructed a home-built steam locomotive which was christened ‚ÄúThe Rocket of China‚Äù, the first steam locomotive ever made in China. From these early beginnings the ‚ÄòKaiping Tramway‚Äô evolved into China‚Äôs first major railway line and administration known as Imperial Railways of North China and later, after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, the Peking-Mukden Railway.

This included working as the Assistant to the President for Manufacturing Policy between February 2011 and August 2011, in the Department of the Treasury as a senior advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury and member of the President's Task Force on the Automotive Industry, and also as Senior Counselor to the U.S. President for Manufacturing Policy. Early life Ron Bloom was born to a Jewish familyJewish Telegraph Agency: \\"Ron Bloom: Car czar in the Labor Zionist tradition\\" By Rachel Tepper August 25, 2009 in New York City and raised in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. His mother, Paula Yackira, was an educator, and his father, Joel Bloom, served 21 years as President of the Franklin Institute Science Museum. The elder Bloom was a prime mover in the conception and development of the Mandell Futures Center, a wing that transformed the institute ‚Äúfrom a dusty bin of outmoded exhibits into what is probably the most advanced science museum in the world.‚Äù A co- author of the influential ‚Äò‚ÄôMuseums for a New Century: A Report of the Commission on Museums for a New Century‚Äô‚Äô, he was a president of the American Alliance of Museums (the first science museum president to serve in that capacity), chairman of the U.S. National Committee of the International Council of Museums, and founding president of the Association of Science- Technology Centers. In 1993, the American Alliance of Museums presented him with its Award for Distinguished Service to Museums; and in 2002, the Franklin dedicated its renovated observatory as the Joel N. Bloom Observatory. After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1977, the younger Bloom went to work first for the Jewish Labor Committee and a year later for the Service Employees International Union. After a time, however, he realized that labor unions suffered from a lack of business knowledge, so he enrolled at Harvard Business School, earning an MBA with Distinction in 1985. Investment Banking CareerLazard= Upon graduation from HBS, Bloom joined the investment banking firm of Lazard Fr√®res & Co. At Lazard, he divided his time between mergers and acquisition, the firm's principal business, and working with unions whose members were involved in corporate bankruptcies and restructuring transactions, a practice originated by Lazard partner Eugene Keilin. Many of the employee-related transactions involved the steel industry‚Äîwhose hourly employees were represented by the United Steelworkers (USW)‚Äîand the airline industry, where Lazard represented pilots who were members of the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA). =Keilin and Bloom= In 1990, Bloom joined Keilin to create their own investment banking firm, Keilin and Bloom, which specialized in representing unions and other employee groups in turnaround and restructuring situations. Representing the USW in the Canadian bankruptcy of Algoma Steel, Bloom avoided a liquidation of the company and succeeded in obtaining majority ownership for the employees in the reorganized company. Continuing a project they began together at Lazard, Keilin and Bloom also represented the ALPA pilots at United Airlines in their attempts to acquire ownership of the company through an employee stock ownership plan. In 1994, they succeeded in obtaining a majority stake in United for the ESOP, creating one of the largest employee-owned companies in the United States. Steelworkers career In 1996, Bloom left the firm to become Special Assistant to George Becker, the President of the USW. His duties included helping the union affect corporate business restructuring, investments, bankruptcies and mergers. In his time with the Steelworkers, he reinforced his reputation as both a fierce negotiator and a creative problem solver, helping shepherd the steel industry through a painful transition period. Bloom's work on behalf of the Steelworkers has been documented by major news publications, including the Wall Street Journal and BusinessWeek. Three examples of transactions in which he played a major role are described briefly below. =LTV, Bethlehem, and ISG= In April 2002 and February 2003 respectively, Bloom facilitated the sale of the assets of LTV Steel and Bethlehem Steel to the International Steel Group (ISG). Led by the financier Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., ISG sought to acquire the assets of LTV and Bethlehem out of bankruptcies without having to assume expensive obligations to former workers. Bloom negotiated a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) that would finance health care for retirees using a portion of ISG's profits. Describing his dealings with Bloom, Ross said, ‚ÄúI found him first of all very, very pragmatic, not overly ideological,‚Äù and ‚Äúa very, very good negotiator.‚Äù =Goodyear= In September 2003, Bloom led contract negotiations with Goodyear Tire, where the USW represented 19,000 active employees and more than 40,000 retirees. The company's management believed rising costs required that they replace several U.S. factories with new facilities in Asia, but the USW proposed an alternative that entailed major changes to Goodyear's long-term business plan. Ultimately, Bloom negotiated an agreement that included concessions in exchange for limits on executive salaries, agreements to restructure the company's debt and invest in U.S. factories, and the right of the union to nominate someone to sit on the company's Board of Directors. The USW avoided significant layoffs, and Jonathan Rich, a senior Goodyear executive, said, ‚ÄúWe got what we needed‚Äù to become competitive again. =Wheeling-Pitt= In 2006, the Brazilian steel company Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional (CSN) tried to merge with Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation (Wheeling- Pitt), a transaction what would have cost a significant number of U.S. jobs. The Steelworkers were opposed to the deal, so Bloom orchestrated a hostile takeover by Esmark, a Chicago-based steel-distribution company, to keep Wheeling-Pitt out of CSN's hands and avoid layoffs. Obama AdministrationAuto Industry Restructurings= In February 2009, Bloom was named Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the President's Task Force on the Automotive Industry. As the deputy to Steve Rattner (who led the Auto Team at Treasury), he helped manage the process that led to the reorganization of General Motors and Chrysler. An experienced dealmaker, he played a key role in extracting concessions from the companies, their lenders and other creditors, and the United Auto Workers (UAW). Bloom was particularly central to the Chrysler negotiations, where his strategy emphasized shared sacrifice to maximize value for all parties. He convinced the UAW, whose principal interest was preserving jobs, to accept painful wage-and-benefit concessions. In return, a VEBA for UAW members would receive a significant equity stake in the reorganized company. The announcement of that agreement put pressure on Chrysler's creditors to forgive a significant portion of their loans. With those commitments sealed, the Treasury agreed to provide the necessary financing to set the company back on its feet. When Rattner left the government, shortly after GM emerged from bankruptcy in August 2009, Bloom took over the responsibility of ‚Äúmonitoring [the auto] industry and protecting the substantial investment the American taxpayers have made‚Äù in GM and Chrysler. On April 21, 2010, GM paid back its outstanding loan from the U.S. government. The remaining Treasury stake in GM consists of $2.1 billion in preferred stock and 60.8 percent of the common equity. Bloom has said that this remaining taxpayer interest in the company will be disposed of ‚Äúas soon as practicable.‚Äù http://cop.senate.gov/documents/testimony-072709-bloom.pdf =Manufacturing Policy= On Labor Day, 2009 (September 7), President Obama formally introduced Bloom as the Administration's Senior Counselor for Manufacturing Policy. He was charged with ‚Äúworking closely with the National Economic Council [to] provide leadership on policy development and strategic planning for the President‚Äôs agenda to revitalize the manufacturing sector.‚Äùhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Names-Ron- Bloom-Senior-Counselor-for-Manufacturing-Policy/ In this capacity, he was instrumental in the formulation of the Administration's Framework for Revitalizing Manufacturing (released on December 16, 2009).http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/100226-annual- report-middle-class.pdf The Framework underlines the critical role manufacturing plays in the U.S. economy and in the fabric of American life; it outlines the major factors that have contributed to the significant difficulties facing American manufacturers; and it describes the Administration's efforts to address each of these factors and revitalize the manufacturing sector.http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/20091216-maunfacturing- framework.pdf From February to August 2011, Ron Bloom served as the Assistant to the President for Manufacturing Policy at the White House. During this time, Bloom played a key role in the agreement between the federal government and leading automakers to raise light-duty vehicle fuel economy standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The White House has estimated that these standards will save consumers $1.7 trillion and reduce oil consumption by an estimated 12 billion barrels.http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press- office/2011/07/29/president-obama-announces-historic-545-mpg-fuel-efficiency- standard Bloom also oversaw the launch of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, an initiative between industry, universities, and the federal government designed to invest in the emerging technologies that will make U.S. manufacturers more economically competitive. Post Obama administration On October 16, 2011, The New York Times reported, \\"the National Association of Letter Carriers announced that it had hired Mr. Bloom and Lazard, the financial advisory and asset management firm, to develop a strategy to revitalize the deficit-laden [U.S.] postal service\\", currently facing a deficit of nearly $10 billion.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/business/postal-union-turns-to- wall-street-for-advice.html?_r=1 Second Paragraph The union is looking to Mr. Bloom to help expand and explore possible solutions needed to address the service's immediate fiscal crisis as well as a range of long-term business strategies. The national president of the union, Fredric V. Rolando, commented about Bloom and Lazard: \\"They have experience in analyzing large, financially complex institutions and crafting creative solutions.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/business/postal-union-turns-to- wall-street-for-advice.html?_r=1 Third Paragraph Public image Bloom has been praised for his role in the Auto Industry restructurings and for his work as Senior Counselor for Manufacturing Policy. On April 29, 2010, he was named as one of Time Magazine‚Äôs 100 Most Influential People in the World (in the category of World Leaders). In the Time 100 issue, Bill Saporito wrote that ‚Äúhis role in brokering the rescue of General Motors and Chrysler while preserving more than 100,000 jobs demanded a synergist who could work both sides of the equation with authority and respect.‚Äù The Detroit News and a book by Bloom's boss Steven Rattner claimed that at the Auto Task Force's farewell dinner in July 2009, Bloom said of his government service: \\"I did this all for the unions.\\" In testimony under oath before Congress, Bloom denied making the statement at all, even in jest.\\"What Did Ron Bloom Say and When Did He Say It?\\" by Eamon Javers, CNBC Washington, July 7, 2011, Retrieved 2011-07-08 \\"Congress asks Obama official to clarify testimony on unions\\" by Andrew Seidman, Los Angeles Times, July 7, 2011, Retrieved 2011-07-08\\"Ron Bloom Asked To 'Clarify' Recent Congressional Testimony\\" by Mary Bruce, ABCNews.com, July 7, 2011, Retrieved 2011-07-08\\"House panel asks Bloom to clarify testimony on unions\\" by Aaron Kessler, Detroit Free Press, July 7, 2011, Retrieved 2011-07-08\\"Opinion: Former auto czar Bloom's words belie motives of GM, Chrysler bailouts\\" by Daniel Howes, The Detroit News, July 7, 2011, Retrieved 2011-07-08 In October 2009, political commentators focused on comments made by Bloom in 2008, namely: \\"We know that the free market is nonsense. ...We kind of agree with Mao that political power comes largely from the barrel of a gun.\\" While conservatives Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and others juxtaposed Bloom's comments with details of Mao's violent dictatorship, progressive groups such as MediaMatters cited instances where conservatives had quoted Mao and where Republican campaign operative Stephen Shadegg claimed to have \\"followed the advice of Mao\\" in the 1960s.\\"Beck, right-wing media bring Mao attack to \\"manufacturing czar\\" Bloom, ignoring conservatives who have cited Mao\\", MediaMatters.org, October 20, 2009, Retrieved 2011-07-08 Bloom's efforts toward automobile dealership closures was criticized for including \\"completely arbitrary factors\\";\\"Federal government made decisions about closing auto dealerships based on race and gender\\" by Mark Hemingway, San Francisco Examiner, July 21, 2010, Retrieved 2011-07-08 * The New Republic Magazine: ‚ÄúBloom‚Ä¶managed the negotiation that plucked Chrysler from its deathbed and married it off to Fiat, making him perhaps the most successful yenta in corporate history.‚Äù * President Obama: ‚ÄúDistinguished by his extraordinary service on the Auto Task Force and his extensive experience with both business and labor, Ron has the knowledge and experience necessary to lead the way in creating the good-paying manufacturing jobs of the future.‚Äù * An anonymous Obama Administration official, describing Bloom's role in the Chrysler restructuring: ‚ÄúRon has been the quiet force that relentlessly and aggressively knocked people's heads together.\\" * Matthew Feldman, lead bankruptcy attorney for the Treasury Auto Team: ‚ÄúIn the course of the Chrysler negotiations, Ron maneuvered so that he was the fulcrum of it all.

He has worked as a political correspondent, fronted the television arts show Backch@t, and was the head of news and current affairs at TVNZ from 2003 to 2007. The New Zealand Herald has described him as controversial. Personal life Born in Auckland, he attended Northcote Primary School and later Northcote College where he was Head Prefect. At the University of Auckland he studied politics and history, and wrote for the student magazine Craccum. He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree, and most of a Masters. He married Janet Wilson, who also works in the media, in c.1997, and has two children from a previous marriage. He takes a photo of Mark Kellogg, an Associated Press reporter who died with General Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, wherever he goes. CareerEarly= Ralston's career began with a cadet job for South Pacific Television in 1979. In 1980, he worked as a general news reporter for Television New Zealand (TVNZ) in Wellington and Christchurch. TVNZ seconded him to the BBC for six months in 1981, where he worked as a reporter for Wales Today in Cardiff. Returning in 1982, he went to the New Zealand Parliament Press Gallery as a political correspondent for TV ONE, where he covered the fall of the Muldoon government. During the mid-1980s, he was a foreign correspondent for TVNZ, reporting from Indonesia, South Africa, China, the Philippines and Europe. He was shot at a Soweto school during the 1986 rebel Cavaliers tour of South Africa, and told by the Ministry of Information he was not welcome back. From 1987, he was a reporter for TVNZ's Frontline, before moving to competitor TV3 as Political Editor in 1989. In 1990 he was expelled from Fiji for his reporting. He later fronted TV3's Nightline current affairs show. =1990s= Ralston played zoo official Stewart in Peter Jackson's 1992 splatter film Braindead. From April 1997 until October 2000 he was the editor of Metro lifestyle magazine. In 1999, an official from the Ministry of Health visited Ralston and threatened to prosecute the magazine under the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990, over a cigar review column. Ralston complained, saying the magazine derived no income from the column. While editor, several top Auckland restaurants banned him due to reviews in the magazine. He hosted the arts and media show Backch@t for the show's three-year run from 1998 to 2000. Backch@t won the New Zealand Film and Television Awards Best Lifestyle Programme for all three years, and the 1999 Qantas Media Award Best Television Media Programme. =2000s= In July 2000, police were called to a Saatchi & Saatchi fundraising event, where it was alleged Ralston had punched guests. Until July 2003 he was writing for the Sunday News and the Independent business weekly, and was a talkback show host on Radio Pacific. CEO Ian Fraser appointed Ralston head of news and current affairs at TVNZ starting on 14 July 2003, Fraser saying, \\"Bill's energy, his experience and just a hint of the mongrel\\" would meet the challenge of the job. Ralston had a goal of reducing the $46 million TVNZ news budget by $4.5 million, and there were a number of high-profile departures from the broadcaster, including Judy Bailey, Richard Long, and Paul Holmes. Discussing the departures later in 2007, he blamed the government, including Prime Minister Helen Clark, for political interference in the salary negotiations. He drew criticism in March 2005 for verbally attacking Prime Television CEO Chris Taylor, saying, \\"I'd be shooting myself. I'd be pouring petrol over myself and throwing myself off Auckland's tallest building\\". In 2006, ONE News won the Qantas Media Award Best News Programme. He faced disciplinary action also in 2006 over an expletive-laden call to a Herald on Sunday journalist, who was making enquires about a homeless cousin. Ralston resigned from TVNZ on 30 January 2007, prior to an announcement of restructuring. Since TVNZ he has written columns for The New Zealand Herald, Herald on Sunday, The Listener, the Media Scrum blog for Fairfax Media, and in 2009 was an afternoon host for Radio Live. Former foreign minister Winston Peters refused to appear on the Sky News New Zealand show covering the 2008 general election, because he objected to Ralston, the host. =2010s= At the 2016 Auckland local elections, Ralston contested the WaitematƒÅ and Gulf ward of the Auckland Council.http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/298528/ralston- launches-bid-for-auckland-council-seat He came second in the contest to incumbent councillor Mike Lee and was not elected. =2020s= As a former editor employed by the Bauer Media Group, he commented on the company's decision to wind down its New Zealand business in response to the government banning magazines as part of the coronavirus lockdown as follows: \\"Eighty years of the Listener gone because some clod in Government decided to ban the publication.\\" Recognition * 1998 and 1999 Qantas Awards for Excellence in Journalism as Best Political Columnist * 1999 Qantas Media Award, Best Overall Columnist.

The animal's typical \\"hopping\\" movement gives it its common name, and is produced by a flexion of the abdomen. In order to do this, it must stand on its legs (amphipods usually rest on their sides) and suddenly extend its abdomen out from under its body. It can thus leap several inches into the air, although without any control over its direction. A great deal of scientific research has been carried out on the animal, to determine the environmental cues which it uses to control its behavior. Description Talitrus saltator reaches lengths between and , with males being slightly larger than females. The body is grayish-brown or grayish-green in colour, with a single pair of black eyes. It has a distinct pair of antennae, with one antenna as more robust than the other. Distribution Talitrus saltator is found around the coasts of the North Sea and north-east Atlantic Ocean from southern Norway to the Mediterranean Sea. In most of its range, its daily cycle is strongly linked to the tides, with daily migrations of up to , but where there are no significant tides (as in parts of the Mediterranean), visual cues are used instead. Life cycle Mating occurs in T. saltator once the photoperiod exceeds 14 hours; this is in contrast to other shoreline animals such as isopods which use air temperature or sea temperature to control breeding times. Mating occurs during the animal's nightly migration down the beach, after the female has moulted. Broods of 13‚Äì15 eggs are carried by the females. When they first hatch, juveniles are sensitive to desiccation but are unable to burrow, and so they live in washed up seaweed with a humidity of 85%‚Äì90%. Although the juveniles become sexually differentiated within a few months, they do not contribute to the second reproductive wave later in the year, but first reproduce the following year. Females die before the males, in their second winter (males live for 21 months, compared to 18 months for females). During the winter, adults burrow into the sand until they reach a moisture content of 2%; this may require them to dig up to deep. Ecology Talitrus saltator spends the day buried at depths of above the strandline, but emerges at night on the falling tide to feed.

Life The son of John Beaumont, clothier, and of Sarah Clarke, his wife, he was born at Hadleigh, Suffolk, on 13 March 1616. He was educated at Hadleigh grammar school, and proceeded to Cambridge in 1631, where he was admitted as a pensioner to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He took his degree of B.A. in 1634, and became a fellow of his college in 1636, the master then being John Cosin. Richard Crashaw, the poet, had now passed from Pembroke College to Peterhouse, and in 1638 he and Beaumont received their degree of M.A. together In 1644 he was one of the royalist fellows ejected from Cambridge, and he retired to Hadleigh, where he sat down to write his epic poem of Psyche. Beaumont fared particularly well during the Commonwealth. From 1643 he held the rectory of Kelshall in Hertfordshire, as non-resident, and in 1646 he added to this, or exchanged it for, the living of Elm-cum-Emneth in Cambridgeshire. He was appointed in the same year to a canonry of Ely. In 1650 he became domestic chaplain to Matthew Wren, bishop of Ely, and held various other sinecures. The wealthy ward of the bishop, a Miss Brownrigg, fell in love with him, and they were married from Ely House in 1650. Beaumont and his wife resided for the next ten years at Tatingston Place, in Suffolk. During this period he wrote most of his minor poems. At the Restoration of 1660 Beaumont was made Doctor of Divinity and one of the king's chaplains. Early in 1661 he went down to Ely to reside, at the bishop's request, but Mrs. Beaumont caught the fen fever, and died on 31 May 1662. She was buried in Ely Cathedral. During his wife's fatal illness Beaumont was appointed master of Jesus College, Cambridge, in succession to John Pearson; and he moved to Cambridge with his six young children, only one of whom lived to manhood. He restored Jesus Chapel at his own expense; then on 24 April 1663 he was admitted master of Peterhouse. His long controversy with Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, dates from 1665. In 1674 he was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity, and delivered a course of lectures on Romans and Colossians, which he forbade his executors to publish. A collective evaluation of the soteriological lectures that he gave and the theological lectures that he moderated reveal his promotion of English-Arminianism at Cambridge, which was already established by his predecessor Peter Gunning. In 1689 he was appointed to meet the leaders of nonconformity as one of the commissioners of comprehension. He preached before the university on 5 November 1699, died on 23 November, and was buried in the college chapel of Peterhouse. Works Psyche, taking him eleven months to write, was published early in 1648. The allegorical poem represents the soul led by divine grace and her guardian angel through the various temptations and assaults of life into her eternal felicity; it is written in a six-line heroic stanza, and contains, in its abridged form, 30,000 lines. In 1702 Charles Beaumont, the only surviving son, brought out a new edition, entirely revised, and enlarged by the addition of four fresh cantos. A life of Joseph Beaumont was written by John Gee of Peterhouse, who affixed it to the collection of Beaumont's poems which he first edited at Cambridge in 1749; further information was published by Hugh Pigot in his History of Hadleigh in 1860. The complete poems of Beaumont, in English and Latin, were first edited, in two quarto vols., privately printed, by A. B. Grosart in 1880, with a memoir in which some additions are made to the information preserved by Gee. Beaumont prefixed a copy of Latin verses to the Muse Juridicae of William Hawkins in 1634, and published in 1665, at Cambridge, Some Observations upon the Apologie of Dr. Henry More. An artist of some pretension, he adorned the altar of Peterhouse Chapel with scripture scenes which have now disappeared.

It has occasionally been considered the unofficial national dish in the Philippines. History The cooking method for the Philippine adobo is indigenous to the Philippines. Pre-colonial Filipinos often cooked or prepared their food with vinegar and salt to keep them fresh longer in the tropical climate of the Philippines. Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with four main traditional types: coconut vinegar, cane vinegar, nipa palm vinegar, and kaong palm vinegar, all of which are linked to traditional alcohol fermentation. Chicken adobo on white rice There are four main traditional cooking methods using vinegar that are still widely prevalent in the Philippines today: kinilaw (raw seafood in vinegar and spices), paksiw (a broth of meat with vinegar and spices), sangkutsa (pre-cooking meat by braising them in vinegar and spices), and finally adobo (a stew of vinegar, garlic, salt/soy sauce, and other spices). It is believed that paksiw, sangkutsa, and adobo were all derivations of kinilaw. They are also related to cooking techniques like sinigang and pinangat na isda that also have a sour broth, albeit using native fruits like calamansi, tamarind, unripe mangoes, bilimbi, santol, and star fruit instead of vinegar. When the Spanish Empire colonized the Philippines in the late 16th century and early 17th century, they encountered the adobo cooking process. It was first recorded in the dictionary Vocabulario de la lengua tagala (1613) compiled by the Spanish Franciscan missionary Pedro de San Buenaventura. He referred to it as adobo de los naturales (\\"adobo of the native peoples\\"). The Spanish also applied the term adobo to any native dish that was marinated before consumption. In the 1794 edition of Vocabulario de la lengua tagala, it was applied to quilau√¨n (kinilaw) a related but different dish which also primarily uses vinegar. In Vocabulario de la lengua Bisaya (1711), the term guinamus (verb form: gamus) was used to refer to any kind of marinades (adobo), from fish to pork. Other terms for precolonial adobo-like dishes among the Visayan peoples are dayok and danglusi. In modern Cebuano, guinamos refers to an entirely different dish, bagoong. In Hiligaynon, guinamos also refers to regional variants of bagoong. Dishes prepared with vinegar, garlic, salt (later soy sauce), and other spices eventually came to be known solely as adobo, with the original term for the dish now lost to history. Description Chicken adobo with broccoli While the adobo dish and cooking process in Filipino cuisine and the general description of adobo in Spanish cuisine share similar characteristics, they refer to different things with different cultural roots. Unlike the Spanish and Latin American adobo, the main ingredients of Philippine adobo are ingredients native to Southeast Asia, namely cane vinegar, soy sauce (originally salt), black peppercorns, and bay leaves. It does not traditionally use chilis, paprika, oregano, or tomatoes. Its only similarity to Spanish and Latin American adobo is the primary use of vinegar and garlic. Philippine adobo has a characteristically salty and sour, and often sweet, taste, in contrast to Spanish and Mexican adobos which are spicier or infused with oregano. Pork adobo with shallots While the Philippine adobo can be considered adobo in the Spanish sense‚Äîa marinated dish‚Äîthe Philippine usage is much more specific to a cooking process (rather than a specific recipe) and is not restricted to meat. Typically, pork or chicken, or a combination of both, is slowly cooked in vinegar, crushed garlic, bay leaves, black peppercorns, and soy sauce. It is served with white rice.Alan Davidson & Tom Jaine. (2006). The Oxford Companion to Food. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 5. .Sifton, Sam. (January 5, 2011). The Cheat: The Adobo Experiment. The New York Times. Retrieved January 7, 2011 It was traditionally cooked in small clay pots (palayok or kulon); but in modern times, metal pots or woks (kawali) are used instead. There are numerous variants of the adobo recipe in the Philippines. The most basic ingredient of adobo is vinegar, which is usually coconut vinegar, rice vinegar, or cane vinegar (although sometimes white wine or cider vinegar can also be used). Almost every ingredient can be changed according to personal preference. Even people in the same household can cook adobo in significantly different ways. Adobong sitaw (Adobong sitaw (green beans and pork) A rarer version without soy sauce is known as adobong puti (\\"white adobo\\"), which uses salt instead, to contrast it with adobong itim (\\"black adobo\\"), the more prevalent versions with soy sauce. Adobong puti is often regarded as the closest to the original version of the Pre-Hispanic adobo. It is similar to another dish known as pinatisan, where patis (fish sauce) is used instead of vinegar. Adobong dilaw (\\"yellow adobo\\"), which uses kalawag (turmeric) to provide the yellow colouring as well as adding in a different flavour, can be found in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. The proportion (or even the presence) of ingredients like soy sauce, bay leaves, garlic, or black pepper can vary. The amount and thickness of the sauce also varies as some like their adobo dry while some like it saucy. Other ingredients can sometimes be used; like siling labuyo, bird's eye chili, jalape√±o pepper, red bell pepper, olive oil, onions, brown sugar, potatoes, or pineapple. It may also be further browned in the oven, pan-fried, deep-fried, or even grilled to get crisped edges. Adobo has been called the quintessential Philippine stew, served with rice both at daily meals and at feasts. It is commonly packed for Filipino mountaineers and travelers because it keeps well without refrigeration. Its relatively long shelf-life is due to one of its primary ingredients, vinegar, which inhibits the growth of bacteria. Variations Beef adobo Based on the main ingredients, the most common adobo dishes are adobong manok, in which chicken is used, and adobong baboy, in which pork is used. Adobong baka (beef), along with adobong manok (chicken), is more popular among Muslim Filipinos. Other meat sources may also be used, such as adobong pug√≤ (quail), adobong itik (duck), adobong kambing (goat). There are also seafood variants which can include fish (adobong isda), catfish (adobong hito), shrimp (adobong hipon), and squid or cuttlefish (adobong pusit). It can even be used to cook vegetables and fruits, like water spinach (adobong kangkong), bamboo shoots (adobong labong), eggplant (adobong talong), banana flowers (adobong pus√¥ ng saging), and okra (adobong okra).AdoboChef (January 5, 2011). Traditional Adobo Recipes Retrieved June 22, 2012 Even more exotic versions include adobong saw√¢ (snake), adobong palak√¢ (frogs), Kapampangan adobung kamaru (mole crickets), and the adobong atay at balunbalunan (chicken liver and gizzard). There are also regional variations. In southern Luzon (Bicol region), and Muslim Zamboanga, for example, it is common to see adobo cooked with coconut milk (known as adobo sa gat√¢). In Cavite, mashed pork liver is added. In Laguna, turmeric was added, giving the dish a distinct yellowish color (known as adobong dilaw, \\"yellow adobo\\"). Adobo has also become a favorite of Filipino-based fusion cuisine, with avant- garde cooks coming up with variants such as \\"Japanese-style\\" pork adobo.

Released in 1990, it is the sequel to the 1989 film Forever Mery. It stars Francesco Benigno, Alessandro Di Sanzo and Salvatore Termini.  Synopsis  Boys on the Outside is the sequel of the 1989 drama film Forever Mery, and features most of the same characters. The film is largely set in ZEN, a bleak, economically deprived quarter on the northern outskirts of Palermo, Sicily, at the end of the 1980s. Its protagonist is Natale Sperandeo (played by Palermo-born actor Francesco Benigno), a young man who has just been released from Malaspina, a juvenile detention centre. Unable to find legitimate work, he takes up with his former gang, consisting of unemployed youths like himself, and perpetrates an armed robbery. The film also traces the divergent paths taken by his former inmates at Rosaspina (actual name Malaspina), such as Mario \\"Mery\\" Libassi, the 17-year-old transvestite, who resumes his previous sordid career as a male prostitute while awaiting trial for the assault on a client; Claudio Catalano, while seeking to avoid the vindictive Carmelo Vella (who blames Claudio for the loss of his left eye), obtains work as a mechanic in another neighbourhood, but shortly afterwards discovers his girlfriend, Vita is pregnant; Antonino Patan√© is forced to push drugs in order to maintain his two small children after the financial police sequester his potatoes which Antonino was selling without a license; and Giovanni Trapani, nicknamed King Kong and a member of Natale's gang, is fatally shot by a plainclothes police officer outside the open-air market of Vucciria after a long chase through the streets of Palermo for having robbed a car radio. Boys on the Outside accurately depicts the social problems faced by Natale and his companions, such as crime, poverty, unemployment, prostitution, teenage pregnancy, and police harassment, which were indelible features of life in the poorer districts of Palermo and other Sicilian cities during that time period. It is a drama with realistic scenes of sex, violence, police brutality, and rape. It ends with the discovery of the body of a young man, burnt beyond recognition, on a refuse tip. It is presumed to be that of Claudio, although the film never reveals its identity. The Italian language is spoken throughout the film mixed with the Palermo dialect of the Sicilian language.

It is connected by an older road to Koseze and by a newer road that branches off the main road from Ilirska Bistrica to Rupa, Croatia. Smaller roads lead from the village to Studena Gora and Veliko Brdo. There are fields in the Dednik area east of the village and in the area known as Boben south of that.

Name Mala Bukovica literally means 'little Bukovica', distinguishing the settlement from neighboring Velika Bukovica (literally, 'big Bukovica'). Bukovica is a common toponym and oronym in Slovenia. It is derived from the adjective bukov 'beech' (from bukev 'beech tree') and originally referred to the local vegetation. The Italian name of the settlement was Bucovizza Piccola.

He was a member of the Canterbury Association, was Dean-designate for the yet to be built ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand, but he never emigrated. Early life Thomas Rowley was born in Middleton Scriven in Shropshire in 1796. His parents were the Rev. Richard Rowley (d. 1812) and Mary Rowley. He was educated at Shrewsbury and at Christ Church, Oxford, from where he obtained a BA (1819), BD and DD (1839). Bridgnorth Grammar School Bridgnorth Grammar School ‚Äì The Headmaster's House In 1821, when Rowley was twenty-four years old, he was appointed Headmaster of Bridgnorth Grammar School in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, on the recommendation of the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Under Dr Rowley's leadership Bridgnorth Grammar School's reputation increased. Dr Rowley's success as a teacher of the Classics soon attracted boarders (housed in the Headmaster's House in St Leonard's Close) from far and near. His pupils included not only Bridgnorth boys, but also those from further afield. The numbers rose to about 150. In 1841 Dr Rowley was attacked by some members of the Town Council who complained of the treatment of the day-boys by the boarders and of the Bridgnorth Grammar School's concentration on the Classics; but the Bridgnorth Borough Treasurer wrote in Rowley's defence that the day-boys can hardly not have benefited from the specialist teachers whom Rowley was able to engage. Distinguished former pupils of Dr Rowley included Bishop James Fraser, the reforming Bishop of Manchester, Lord Lingen, the influential civil servant, Henry John Roby, the classical scholar, writer on Roman law and Member of Parliament, Rev. Robert William Eyton, Rector of Ryton and author of The Antiquities of Shropshire. and Rev. Osborne Gordon, the influential Oxford don. Dr Rowley's successors after 1850 had not his ability, and accordingly the School's numbers and reputation, and their own emoluments, declined.J. F. A. Mason, The Borough of Bridgnorth 1157‚Äì1957 (Bridgnorth, 1957), 38 The East Window of the St Leonard's Church in Bridgnorth was replaced in memory of Dr Rowley. Rowley House (red), one of the Bridgnorth Endowed School's three houses, is named after Dr Rowley. Later life Rowley joined the Canterbury Association on 10 April 1851 as a committee member. He purchased land from the association in Canterbury, New Zealand. He was assigned land at Barrys Bay at the head of Akaroa Harbour (technically, his son Thomas bought this land, but it is believed that Rowley Sr paid for it) and at Middleton in Christchurch. He was chosen as the Dean-designate for the yet to be built ChristChurch Cathedral, but he never came out to the colony. His appointment upset Bishop Selwyn, and the proposed cathedral chapter was dropped again until the cathedral was built. Family Rowley's sons John Cotton Rowley and Thomas Rowley emigrated to New Zealand. Thomas, who emigrated in 1853, became a Member of Parliament, but returned to live in Guernsey. John remained in New Zealand.

Rozum was born to famous musical parents. His father was baritone Alexander Rozum and his mother was Galina Rozhdestvenskaya, conductor of the Russian Academic Folk Choir. Both were recipients of the title of People's Artist of the USSR. When Rozum was only age seven, his mother discovered that he had perfect pitch, leading to his immediate enrolment in the Central Music School of the Moscow Conservatory, where he would later study under Lev Naumov and Yevgeny Malinin, themselves students of Heinrich Neuhaus. Rozum developed an interest in philosophy by age fourteen, becoming especially interested in the works of the exiled Nikolai Berdyayev. From there, Rozum became extremely spiritual, leading life as an ascetic and, at the risk of his own freedom, immersing himself in the works of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. In 1975, at the age of twenty-one, Rozum was selected to compete in the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels. Due to political reasons, Soviet authorities denied his visa and almost immediately drafted him into the military where he would be totally separated from performing on piano for eighteen months. By 1979, changes in policy allowed him to travel abroad, but mostly within Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Rozum immediately began performing in Western venues. In 2001, Yuri Rozum was awarded the title People's Artist of Russia by Russian president Vladimir Putin. Polls taken by Russian media place Rozum within that country's list of \\"Top Ten Classical Musicians in Russia.\\" Official Yuri Rozum website In 2003, Rozum became the first pianist to perform a recital in the Main Hall of the Russian Federation Government House.

The development of a suburb south of the rapidly growing C√≥rdoba of the late nineteenth century created the need for an extensive new green space for the area. The new neighborhood's chief developer, Miguel Crisol, commissioned a French urbanist for the task in 1889, Carlos Thays. Newly arrived, Thays planned the new park on a plateau overlooking the Ca√±ada Brook to the west and the National University of C√≥rdoba's colonial campus to the south. This would be the first of over a dozen ambitious urban design projects Thays would undertake across Argentina until his death in 1934.welcomeargentina.com Work began in 1890 on the 17 hectare (43 acre) park and, upon its opening in 1911, it was named Parque Sarmiento in honor of former President Domingo Sarmiento, the noted promoter of the national educational system born one hundred years earlier.

It is termed benign because it rarely progresses to clinically significant chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. Morphology The kidneys appear symmetrically atrophic and there is a reduced nephron mass. The kidneys have a surface of diffuse, fine granularity that resembles grain leather. Microscopically, the basic anatomic change consists of hyaline thickening of the walls of the small arteries and arterioles (hyaline arteriolosclerosis). Under a microscope, this appears as a homogeneous, pink hyaline thickening at the expense of the vessel lumina, with loss of underlying cellular detail. The narrowing of the lumen restricts blood flow, resulting in ischemia. All structures of the kidney can show ischemic atrophy although glomerular ischemic atrophy may be patchy. In advanced cases of benign nephrosclerosis the glomerular tufts may become globally sclerosed. Diffuse tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are present. Often there is a scant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate. The larger blood vessels (interlobar and arcuate arteries) show reduplication of internal elastic lamina along with fibrous thickening of the media (fibroelastic hyperplasia) and the subintima. Clinical Course Benign nephrosclerosis alone hardly ever causes severe damage to the kidney, except in susceptible populations, such as African Americans, where it may lead to uremia and death. However, all persons with this disease usually show some functional impairment, such as loss of concentration or a variably diminished GFR. A mild degree of proteinuria is a frequent finding.

This project is owned by Al-Balagh Cultural Society in Qatar and is administered by Media International. Biblioislam.net is according to its founder Hani Atiyyah, professor of Library and Information Science at Cairo University, the first and largest academic website to be launched in both Arabic and English in the Muslim world that provides comprehensive informative, academic, intellectual, and interactive services. These services are available for students, researchers, intellects, and thinkers in fields that serve the paradigm of ‚Äúvalues and identity‚Äù of the contemporary Muslim world. History The project initiated within IslamOnline.net under the name of \\"E-Library\\" in November 2001. The E-Library was created with the purpose of fulfilling the urgent need of Arabic-speaking researchers in obtaining sources of information in the form of bibliographic data. In July 2003, its service developed through the same website and was given a new name, \\"Al-Riwaq\\". At this stage, abstracts, as well as the selective dissemination of information service, was added and made available to registered researchers on the website. A bibliographic database under the name of \\"IMAM,\\" for English-speaking researchers was developed, IMAM being the abbreviation of: Islam, Muslims, Arabs, and Middle East. In 2003, the project was planned and registered as an independent website under the name \\"Biblioislam.net\\" and booked the domains; .net, .org, .com, .info on the internet. In May 2006, the Arabic website of Biblioislam.net was launched, adding new sections, including, abstracts, reviews, full text, prizes and awards, site directory, and upcoming conferences. Biblioislam's English and Arabic websites include the same sections and services, but with different content. Currently, in addition to its Arabic and English websites, Biblioislam.net is working on the release of other multilingual versions of the website in French, German, Turkish, Malawi, Persian and Urdu. BiblioIslam.net has a network of 70 international organizations, universities, research institutions and academic publishers. To this date, the website provides more than 250,000 searchable materials of bibliographic data in both Arabic and English. This bibliographic data include approximately 90,000 university theses that cover 516 universities, about 80,000 scholarly books that cover 5,653 publishers, about 60,000 articles published by 2,089 academic periodicals and journals, and about 20,000 researches published by 1,139 national and international conferences, symposiums, forums, and seminars. The website also allows browsing more than 20,000 abstracts and about 5,000 full- texts. At present, over 35,000 registered researchers on the website, from 164 countries, benefit from this massive collectionA Gateway to Academic Research. IslamOnline.net, Mission The mission of the Biblioislam.net project was originally aimed at preserving the heritage of the Muslim World ‚ÄúUmmah‚Äù, covering its vast areas in different languages. The name ‚ÄúBiblioislam.net‚Äù was chosen because the first part of the term, which is ‚Äúbiblio‚Äù broadly means: library, a list of books, love for reading, and knowledge. While the meaning of the second part, ‚ÄúIslam‚Äù, indicates that the intellectual writings on the website are by, or about the Muslim Ummah. In order to accomplish this mission, the project defined its subject matter and time limits, confining it to the scholarly writings published throughout the twentieth century onwards. The vision of the project, as described on the website, is to integrate with other projects related to the academic field, with the aim of forming an academic community that interacts through the internet, to serve in the future as an independent institutional research entity, gaining its reliability and credibility through its interactive services and authentic contentBiblioIslam.net's Manager Speaks on Launch of English Website.

NoE provides a link between businesses considering European expansion or relocation and resources in North England.North of England Inward Investment Agency North of England Inward Investment Agency Once a company makes the decision to expand or relocate into North England, NoE‚Äôs function changes to be a bridge for that transition, working to connect new inward investment companies with the people, resources, funding and more to help minimize risk and increase profitability. Some of the planning services that NoE provides to potential inward investment companies include: industry trends analysis, recruitment and training assistance, matching skills provision to employer needs, site location assistance, legal/customs/taxation information, introductions to private funding, links to academia, as well as UK and region specific economic and market information. With several offices located throughout the U.S. and Canada NoE targets specific industries that would benefit from the infrastructure in place in the UK. These specific industries include: Life Sciences , Energy and Environment , IT and Media , Advanced Engineering , and Professional Services . NoE was established under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998, all of which were formally launched in eight English regions on 1 April 1999.

The RDA Chairs meet regularly with each other and with Government ministers to advise on national policy. They provide a regional perspective informed by work on the ground with partners and by the extensive consultations they hold in the regions. RDAs help central government ensure that local conditions and local needs are fully taken into account when they draw up national policy.

It was written about King Olaf II of Norway (Olaf Haraldsson), later Saint Olaf (Olav den Hellige), patron saint of Norway. History It was written in c. 1225 by Snorri Sturluson, who made use of the saga by the priest Styrmir K√°rason, now largely lost except for some fragments in Flateyjarb√≥k.Finlay, Fagrskinna. p. 9. A revised version of the Separate Saga was later incorporated into the Heimskringla (c. 1230), often ascribed to Snorri Sturluson. Like many other kings' sagas, the work cites skaldic poems for historical verification or literary embroidery. The work is also valuable for being preceded by two prologues. The principal witness of the text is MS nr. 2 4¬∞ in the National Library of Sweden (Kungliga biblioteket), Stockholm. In the longer prologue, Snorri Sturluson expounds on the historical value of skaldic poetry: :En √æ√≥ √æykki m√©r √æat merkiligast til sannenda, er berum or√∞um er sagt √≠ kv√¶√∞um e√∞a √∂√∞rum kve√∞skap, √æeim er sv√° var ort um konunga e√∞a a√∞ra h√∂f√∞ingja, at √æeir sj√°lfir heyr√∞u, e√∞a √≠ erfikv√¶√∞um √æeim, er sk√°ldin f≈ìr√∞u sonum √æeira. √ûau or√∞, er √≠ kve√∞skap standa, eru in s√∂mu sem √≠ fyrstu v√°ru, ef r√©tt er kve√∞it, √æ√≥tt at hverr ma√∞r hafi s√≠√∞an numit af √∂√∞rum, ok m√° √ævi ekki breyta. :\\"And yet I find that most important for veracity, which is said straightforwardly in poems or other poetry that was composed about kings or other chieftains so that they themselves heard it, or in those commemorative poems which the skalds brought to their sons. Those words which stand in poetry are the same as they were in the beginning, if the recitation is correct, although each person has since learned it from another and for that reason nothing can be distorted.\\"Edition: Bjarni A√∞albjarnarson, Heimskringla, vol. 2, p. 422; translation: Gade, \\"Poetry and its changing importance.\\" p. 67.

The aircraft, a Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800, crashed into a field approximately north of the Polderbaan runway (18R), prior to crossing the A9 motorway inbound, at 09:26 UTC (10:26 CET), having flown from Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft broke into three pieces on impact. The wreckage did not catch fire. The crash was caused primarily by the aircraft's automated reaction, which was triggered by a faulty radio altimeter. This caused the autothrottle to decrease the engine power to idle during approach. The crew noticed this too late to take appropriate action to increase the thrust and recover the aircraft before it stalled and crashed. Boeing has since issued a bulletin to remind pilots of all 737 series and BBJ aircraft of the importance of monitoring airspeed and altitude, advising against the use of autopilot or autothrottle while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies. A 2020 investigation by The New York Times found that the Dutch investigation into the crash \\"either excluded or played down criticisms\\" of Boeing following pressure from Boeing and US federal safety officials, who instead \\"emphasized pilot error as a factor ... rather than design flaws.\\" BackgroundAircraft= Kiev-Boryspil Airport in August 2008 The aircraft operating Flight 1951 was a 7-year-old Next Generation Boeing 737-800 series model 8F2 with registration TC-JGE, named \\"Tekirdaƒü\\". Model 8F2 denotes the configuration of the 737-800 built for use by Turkish Airlines. It had 51 aircraft of this model in service at the time of the crash. The aircraft made its first flight on January 24, 2002, and was delivered to Turkish Airlines on March 27, 2002. =Flight= There were 128 passengers and 7 crew members on board (135 people, in total).Final report, section 2.4 \\"History of the flight\\", p.25 The flight was under the command of Instructor Captain Hasan Tahsin Arƒ±san, aged 54.Turkish Airlines names four dead crew members in Amsterdam crash A former Turkish Air Force fleet commander, Captain Arƒ±san had been working for Turkish Airlines since 1996 and was one of the most experienced pilots at the airline. He had over 5,000 hours of flight time on the F-4E Phantom II. Olgay √ñzg√ºr, 28, was the safety pilot of the flight, a graduate of a flight school in Ankara, who flew the MD-80 for World Focus Airlines before joining Turkish Airlines and passing the 737 type rating in 2006; he was sitting in the cockpit's center jump seat. Murat Sezer, 42, co-pilot under line training, was flying as co-pilot. The cabin crew consisted of Figen Eren, Perihan √ñzden, Ulvi Murat Eskin, and Yasemin Vural.  Crash  Schiphol Airport with the Polderbaan runway depicted in black and the location of the crash marked with a red star The flight was cleared for an approach on runway 18R (also known as the Polderbaan runway) but came down short of the runway threshold, sliding through the wet clay of a plowed field. The aircraft suffered significant damage. Although the fuselage broke into three pieces, it did not catch fire. Both engines separated and came to rest from the fuselage. While several survivors and witnesses indicated that it took rescuers 20 to 30 minutes to arrive at the site after the crash, others have stated that the rescuers arrived quickly at the scene. About 60 ambulances arrived along with at least three LifeLiner helicopters (air ambulances, Eurocopter EC135), and a fleet of fire engines. An unconfirmed report by De Telegraaf states that the firefighters were at first given the wrong location for the crash site, delaying their arrival. Lanes of the A4 and A9 motorways were closed to all traffic to allow emergency services to quickly reach the site of the crash. The bodies of the three cockpit crew members were the last to be removed from the plane, at around 20:00 that evening, because the cockpit had to be examined before it could be cut open to get to these crew members. Also, some of the survivors say that at least one of the pilots was alive after the crash. The relatives of the passengers on the flight were sent to Amsterdam by Turkish Airlines shortly afterward. All flights in and out of Schiphol Airport were suspended, according to an airport spokeswoman. Several planes were diverted to Rotterdam The Hague Airport as well as to Brussels Airport. At about 11:15 UTC (12:15 CET), it was reported that the Kaagbaan runway (06/24) had been re-opened to air traffic, followed by the Buitenveldertbaan runway (09/27). Turkish Airlines continues to use the flight number 1951 on its Istanbul-to-Amsterdam route, primarily operated by an Airbus A330. Investigation The investigation was led by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB, or OVV), and assisted by an expert team from Turkish Airlines and a representative team of the American NTSB, accompanied by advisors from Boeing and the FAA, Turkish Directorate General of Civil Aviation (SHGM), the operator, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and the French Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la s√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA). The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder were recovered quickly after the crash, after which they were transported to Paris to read out the data. The Dutch public prosecution initially asked the DSB to hand over the black boxes, but the DSB refused to do so. It stated that there was no indication of homicide, manslaughter, hijacking or terrorism, which would warrant an investigation by the prosecution. Animated reconstruction of the crash by the Dutch Safety Board While on final approach for landing, the aircraft was about 2,000 ft (610 m) above ground, when the left-hand (captain's) radio altimeter suddenly changed from to read height, although the right-hand (co-pilot's) radio altimeter functioned correctly. The voice recording showed that the crew was given an audible warning signal (\\"TOO LOW!, GEAR!\\") that indicated that the aircraft's landing gear should be down, as the aircraft was, according to the radio altimeter, flying too low., official translation from Later, the safety board's preliminary report modified this analysis, indicating that the flight data recorder history of the captain's radio altimeter showed 8191 feet (the maximum possible recorded) until the aircraft descended through 1950, then suddenly showed negative 8 feet. The throttles were pulled back to idle thrust to slow the aircraft to descend and acquire the glideslope, but the autothrottle unexpectedly reverted to \\"retard\\" mode, which is designed to automatically decrease thrust shortly before touching down on the runway at above runway height. Section 4.20.14 At 144 kt, the pilots manually increased thrust to sustain that speed, but the autothrottle immediately returned the thrust lever to idle power because the first officer did not hold the throttle lever in position. The throttles remained at idle for about 100 seconds while the aircraft slowed to , below reference speed as the aircraft descended below the required height to stay on the glideslope. The stick-shaker activated at about above the ground, indicating an imminent stall, the autothrottle advanced, and the captain attempted to apply full power. The engines responded, but there was not enough altitude or forward airspeed to recover, and the aircraft hit the ground tail- first at . The data from the flight recorder also showed that the same altimeter problem had happened twice during the previous eight landings but that on both occasions the crew had taken the correct action by disengaging the autothrottle and manually increasing the thrust. Investigations are under way to determine why more action had not been taken after the altimeter problem was detected. In response to the preliminary conclusions, Boeing issued a bulletin, Multi-Operator Message (MOM) 09-0063-01B, to remind pilots of all 737 series and Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) aircraft of the importance of monitoring airspeed and altitude (the \\"primary flight instruments\\"), advising against the use of autopilot or autothrottle while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies. Following the release of the preliminary report, Dutch and international press concluded that pilot inattention caused the accident, though several Turkish news publications still emphasized other possible causes. On 9 March 2009, the recovery of the wreckage started. All parts of the plane were moved to an East Schiphol hangar for reconstruction. It was reported that the first officer survived the accident, but that rescuers were unable to reach him via the cockpit door, owing to security measures introduced in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The rescuers eventually cut their way into the cockpit through the roof, by which time the first officer had died. Seat map showing injuries and deaths The final report was released on 6 May 2010. The Dutch Safety Board stated that the approach was not stabilized; hence, the crew ought to have initiated a go- around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the autothrottle reduced thrust to idle, owing to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase; all this went unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above; this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew's workload. The subsequent approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash. Turkish Airlines disputed the crash inquiry findings on stall recovery. Passengers There were nine fatalities and a total of 120 injuries, 11 of them serious. Five of the deceased were Turkish citizens, including the pilot, the co-pilot, a trainee pilot and one member of the cabin crew. Four were Americans, of whom three have been identified as Boeing employees stationed in Ankara and working on an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C;) program for the Turkish military. The plane carried 53 passengers from the Netherlands, 51 from Turkey, seven from the United States, three from the United Kingdom, one each from Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy, and one was an unidentified national.  Conspiracy theories  Following media speculation, a spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Haarlem confirmed in April 2009 to Agence France-Presse that instructions were given following the crash to remove four Boeing laptops from the wreckage, and that the laptops were handed over to the US embassy in The Hague. According to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, the Boeing employees on board were in possession of confidential military information. Turkish media outlets Radikal and S√∂zc√º also reported that the Boeing employees on board were in possession of confidential military information, and that the rescue response was delayed because American officials had specifically requested from Dutch authorities that no one was to approach the wreckage until after the confidential information was retrieved. According to Radikal, the then-CEO of Turkish Airlines Temel Kotil had also stated that a Turkish Airlines employee stationed at Schiphol Airport had arrived at the crash site with their apron-access airport identification but was prevented from reaching the wreckage, and was handcuffed and detained by Dutch authorities after resisting. While the De Telegraaf article and some Turkish sources allege that FBI or CIA agents were on-site for recovery, this was denied by the prosecutor's office. Boeing cover-up and NTSB participation A New York Times investigation by Chris Hamby published in January 2020 in the aftermath of the Boeing 737 MAX groundings claimed that the Dutch Safety Board \\"either excluded or played down criticisms of the manufacturer in its 2010 final report after pushback from a team of Americans that included Boeing and federal safety officials...who said that certain pilot errors had not been 'properly emphasized'\\". The Hamby article draws on a 2009 human factors analysis by Sidney Dekker, which was not published publicly by the Safety Board until after the New York Times investigation was published. In February 2020, it was reported that Boeing refused to cooperate with a new Dutch review on the crash investigation and that the National Transportation Safety Board had refused Dutch lawmakers' request to participate.

The use of an exemplar is especially important to questioned document examination. HistoryUse Handwriting exemplars are used by a document examiner to determine the writing habits of an individual. Ideally, the exemplars will provide an adequate picture of the writer's habits such that a meaningful comparison can be conducted with the questioned material. There are two types of handwriting exemplars that may be used; request writings and collected writings. Request writings are obtained from an individual specifically for the purposes of conducting a handwriting comparison whereas collected writings are samples the individual produced for some other, unrelated reason generally in the course of their day-to-day activities. The two types of exemplars are complementary to one another. Request writings can be controlled to some degree by whoever obtains them. That is, it is possible to exercise some control over the writing to ensure that it is written in a comparable manner using a similar writing instrument, similar paper, etc. Most important, the text to be written is dictated to the writer so that it can either match the questioned text exactly or be modified to ensure comparability without exactly matching the text if, for example, the text itself should remain unknown. The primary concerns with request writing is that the writer might attempt to intentionally alter (disguise) their writing habits or the sample might not display the full range of the writer's natural variation. Collected writings are less likely to be affected by intentional alteration (disguise) and, if sufficient quantities can be obtained, should cover the writer's range of natural variation. As a result, the limitations of either type can be overcome by the other. Example Paragraphs The following are a few examples of pre- determined text passages that have been used to obtain request exemplars. The text may be used exactly as shown here or modified to incorporate specific words or letter combinations that match the text of the questioned document.

The name is a pun of the classic Swedish TV-series Hem till byn as well as Emmerdale which is known as Hem till g√•rden (Home to the farm) in Sweden. The series was created and written by Per Simonsson, Fredde Granberg, Johan Petersson and Stefan Roos. The later three also (among others) starred in the show. In total 2 seasons of 12 episodes each were produced before the show was canceled.  Plot  The setting is 992 in Sweden, in a suburb of Birka called Midg√•rd, which is the last village in Sweden where people still believe in the old Norse gods. Meanwhile, the real chieftain Snorre den Store (Snorre the Great, but with the alternative meaning \\"big willie\\") is away plundering in the Mediterranean. His youngest son Lill-Snorre (Little-Snorre or \\"little willie\\") is in charge of the village, and forced to guard his father's Byzantine thrall Cassandra, who Lill-Snorre also falls in love with. The episodes usually feature Lill-Snorre and his not so great men attempting a new scheme to get money (which they are notoriously short on), sometimes by Plundering and sometimes by more honest means, or Lill-Snorre trying to impress Cassandra and outshine R√∂vhalt.  Style  The series are often considered childish as the episodes contain a lot of Toilet humor and vulgar language as well as plenty of face punches, groin kicks and eye pokes, often with an added sound effect. The swear words used are often with references to the Old Norse gods, for example \\"Baldur's balls\\", \\"Freya's boob\\" and \\"Ymir's giant ass\\".  Main characters  Lill-Snorre = Portrayed by Fredde Granberg. His name means \\"Little-Willie\\". The opposite of the stereotypical Viking; cannot stand the sea or see blood without vomiting violently. He is laughed at by his friends for the small genitals implied by his name. Although he is more intelligent than others, he is shy and cowardly, and cannot face an argument with Cassandra without stuttering, sweating and sometimes even crying. He is afraid to say openly that he and Cassandra are a couple, since his father would probably kill him if he found out. He has an ability to think up quick comebacks whenever Halvdan insults or questions him, often followed by a groin-kick. = Cassandra = Portrayed by Sara Sommerfeld. A beautiful slave from Byzantium (although her former boyfriend appeared to be Spanish). She is Lill-Snorre's girlfriend, and although she often assaults Lill-Snorre when he does something stupid or appears (mostly by mistake) with another woman and bullies him about his penis size, they are in love. When Lill-Snorre tries to argue with her, he shutters and barely succeeds in saying what he wants. She is very spoiled and must always have what she wants. = Tyke M√∂rbult = Portrayed by Marko Lehtosalo. His name means \\"Tyke Tender-Pounder\\" or \\"Tyke Mauler\\" (m√∂rbulta = \\"to maul\\", from m√∂r = \\"tender\\" and bulta = \\"to pound\\"). Raised in Midg√•rd, although from his accent, he appears to be Finnish. The resident berserker, he seems to have a learning disability as he is often drooling and does not use words such as \\"you\\" or \\"I\\" (basically speaking in Third person). Calling him dumb or insulting Lill- Snorre (or annoying Tyke in general) is not a good idea as he may hit his adversary with his club. Lill-Snorre does not look down upon him as he does with Runar or Halvdan, as he knows that hitting Tyke will result in fighting back, unlike Halvdan and Runar who only take their punishment. Instead Lill- Snorre favours him as his best ally, and because of this, Tyke is very loyal to Lill-Snorre. = Runar Tv√•lfager = Portrayed by Johan Petersson. His name means \\"Runar Pretty-Boy\\". Blond, tall and strong, he is known as the \\"sex- machine from M√§laren\\", and prone to jumping into the sack with anything female (including the Queen of Sweden and Lill-Snorre's mother) but he is utterly unintelligent. Lill-Snorre often beats him when he asks stupid questions. Runar is the member of the group who ruins Lill-Snorre's situations the most. = Halvdan Glappk√§ft = Portrayed by Stefan Roos. His name means \\"Halvdan Blabbermouth\\". He is the considered the most annyoing member of the group, and his laugh sounds like a goat. He is the smartest member, but also the least respected, Lill-Snorre neglects to refer him as a member of the crew, and calls him Gunilla. Halvdan competes with Runar for his rank as sex-machine, and Lill-Snorre's rank as a chief because he is weak as a chief. However, Halvdan is the only member of the group that Lill-Snorre can feel superior to, and is most often on the receiving end of his eye-pokes and groin-kicks. Tyke also beats him up on a regular basis. = Gammelman = Portrayed by Rolf Skoglund. Gammelman (name meaning \\"old man\\") is the (somewhat senile) elder of the Midgard village, he is an Aesir Gothi aged around 100. He is sexually kinky and often refers to the gods' sexual parts when he is talking about them. He uses unrecommended methods to heal people, such as pouring hot water in the anus of the king when he has toothache. He often intends to sacrifice the monk Peter Nicolaus. = R√∂vhalt = Played by Per Morberg. A rich trader from Birka and an old \\"comrade\\" of Lill-Snorre's father, he often tries to charm Cassandra. He received his name (which means \\"arse-limp\\") because Snorre den Store cut his left buttock off when fighting over Cassandra in Byzantium. He often makes fun of Lill-Snorre, but Lill-Snorre does not dare retaliate because of R√∂vhalt's position. On the other hand, Gammelman, who is not afraid of anything, has called him \\"the man who takes half price for ham'\\" (due to the Swedish word \\"skinka\\" meaning both \\"ham\\" and \\"buttock\\" in English). = Peter Nicolaus the monk = Played by Mikael Riesebeck. Nicolaus was sent to Midgard by the Pope as a punishment for an incident with the Pope's sisters. He is picked on and threatened by Gammelman that he will be made a sacrificial victim. Cassandra is apparently his only defense, because she wants a Latin teacher. He is called \\"Petter-Niklas\\" (which is a nickname for \\"Penis\\") by Lill-Snorre and the other Vikings. The Vikings force him to make mead for them regularly.  Recurring characters Snorre den Store= Played by Anders Ahlbom. Lill-Snorre's father, and portrayed as being extremely masculine, and the exact opposite of Lill-Snorre. He is famous for have set fire to Paris single-handedly, and raped half of Rome. He has set to sea with his seven strongest sons, leaving Lill-Snorre to guard Cassandra in Midg√•rd.

She is portrayed by Canadian actress Alaina Huffman. Johansen is a US Air Force medic who comes from a poor background. Not able to afford medical school, she considered the US Air Force her best option. Johansen made her first appearance in the pilot episode, \\"Air\\", first broadcast in the United States and Canada in 2009. It was later revealed Johansen is pregnant with Colonel Young's child after the two had an affair before being stranded on the ship.  Character arc  Johansen comes from a modest background and dreamed of being a doctor, but could not afford medical school. Instead, she joined the Air Force. However, after receiving a scholarship, she elected to leave the Stargate program to attend medical school, much to the dismay of IOA representative Camile Wray. After Doctor Simms dies during the attack on the Icarus Base, she is the only medically trained person aboard the Destiny, and is forced to assume doctor-like responsibilities over the rest of the people aboard ship. Lieutenant Johansen is third in Destiny's chain of command, after Colonel Everett Young and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott. In the pilot episode, it's said that TJ resigned from her position as paramedic, and although it's not revealed why, it's obvious Col. Young knows more about it. It's later revealed via a dream Col. Young has that he and TJ were romantically involved with each other prior to arriving on Destiny, and that when their affair ended, TJ decided to resign. While visiting an Earth-like planet, TJ tells Chloe that she is pregnant with Colonel Young's child, and that conception occurred about 15 weeks earlier, while they were still at the Icarus base. It is unclear if the pregnancy prompted her desire to resign her commission. In any event, although she was scheduled to leave two weeks before the evacuation to the Destiny, she did not leave as planned for reasons never made clear. Eventually she tells Young about the pregnancy, and he promises her they will make it work. Weeks later, Destiny is taken over by the Lucian Alliance, and battle ensues. In the finale of the first season, TJ is shot in her abdomen, and although she survives, her very premature daughter does not. However, while unconscious, TJ sees a vision of her baby being kept safe by Dr. Caine and some other Icarus refugees who had remained behind on the alien Earth-like planet (named \\"Eden\\" by the crew) in the episode \\"Faith\\". This leads TJ to believe that some kind of mystical, religious force has protected her baby. However, some time later, Caine and the others return, without any memory of the baby in \\"Visitation\\" (episode 2.09). The people of Destiny believe that all of the people who had been left behind on the planet died, and the aliens who had made the planet resurrected them and returned them to the Destiny, but that they could not resurrect their souls, so all of them die again, after remembering the circumstances of their first death. Young believes that the Destiny implanted the memory into TJ in order to help her to cope with her baby's death. TJ still holds out hope that there was some truth to her vision. TJ is well liked by everyone of the crew. Chloe starts to see TJ as her friend, and even Dr. Rush and Master Sgt. Greer, who generally do not like people, seem to have the utmost respect for her. As their time on the Destiny lengthens, TJ begins performing increasingly complicated medical procedures, including a kidney transplant. Nearing the end of the series she finds out that the alternate her on Novus died of ALS which cannot be cured, though they download some of the archives from the planet there is no cure found in the archives.  Conceptual history  In the character breakdown for the series, Tamara Johansen was originally named Tamara Jon, and was of Asian descent. After Huffman was cast for the role, the character's surname was changed to Johansen and her ethnicity was changed to European. Joseph Mallozzi, executive producer of the two prior Stargate TV shows, considered Huffman's audition in December 2008 \\"so good that, quite frankly, we would've been crazy not to cast her\\".

Ltd as a successor of the Philippines' most popular 2T motorcycle/tricycle model. It debuted in 1977 especially for the Asian market. While the older Yamaha RS-100 uses a pressed steel frame that also acts as the main body, the RS-100 uses steel tubes for the frames and metal cover sets for the body. The Yamaha RS-100T comes in three displacement options - scooters, 100cc and 135cc. In addition to the three models that use carburetors, Yamaha also produces the fuel-injected 83cc model known as Yamha. By 2004, the RS-100T was succeeded by a more efficient and environmentally friendly Yamaha STX four-stroke motorcycle. In addition, the 150cc model includes a key slot cover for better protection against theft. Starting from 2007, the Yamaha STX in Philippines began using fuel injection system to replace the carburetors used by most of the Yamaha series.

The process is named after Patrick Moran, who first proposed the model in 1958. It can be used to model variety-increasing processes such as mutation as well as variety-reducing effects such as genetic drift and natural selection. The process can describe the probabilistic dynamics in a finite population of constant size N in which two alleles A and B are competing for dominance. The two alleles are considered to be true replicators (i.e. entities that make copies of themselves). In each time step a random individual (which is of either type A or B) is chosen for reproduction and a random individual is chosen for death; thus ensuring that the population size remains constant. To model selection, one type has to have a higher fitness and is thus more likely to be chosen for reproduction. The same individual can be chosen for death and for reproduction in the same step. Neutral drift Neutral drift is the idea that a neutral mutation can spread throughout a population, so that eventually the original allele is lost. A neutral mutation does not bring any fitness advantage or disadvantage to its bearer. The simple case of the Moran process can describe this phenomenon. The Moran process is defined on the state space which count the number of A individual. Since the number of A individuals can change at most by one at each time step, a transition exists only between state i and state and . Thus the transition matrix of the stochastic process is tri-diagonal in shape and the transition probabilities are :\\\\begin{align} P_{i,i-1} &= \\\\frac{N-i}{N} \\\\frac{i}{N} P_{i,i} &= 1- P_{i,i-1} - P_{i,i+1} P_{i,i+1} &= \\\\frac{i}{N} \\\\frac{N-i}{N} \\\\end{align} The entry P_{i,j} denotes the probability to go from state i to state j. To understand the formulas for the transition probabilities one has to look at the definition of the process which states that always one individual will be chosen for reproduction and one is chosen for death. Once the A individuals have died out, they will never be reintroduced into the population since the process does not model mutations (A cannot be reintroduced into the population once it has died out and vice versa) and thus P_{0,0}=1. For the same reason the population of A individuals will always stay N once they have reached that number and taken over the population and thus P_{N,N}=1. The states 0 and N are called absorbing while the states are called transient. The intermediate transition probabilities can be explained by considering the first term to be the probability to choose the individual whose abundance will increase by one and the second term the probability to choose the other type for death. Obviously, if the same type is chosen for reproduction and for death, then the abundance of one type does not change. Eventually the population will reach one of the absorbing states and then stay there forever. In the transient states, random fluctuations will occur but eventually the population of A will either go extinct or reach fixation. This is one of the most important differences to deterministic processes which cannot model random events. The expected value and the variance of the number of A individuals at timepoint t can be computed when an initial state is given: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}[X(t)\\\\mid X(0) = i] &= i  \\\\operatorname{Var}(X(t)\\\\mid X(0) = i) &= \\\\tfrac{2i}{N} \\\\left(1-\\\\tfrac{i}{N} \\\\right ) \\\\frac{1- \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2}{N^2} \\\\right )^t}{\\\\frac{2}{N^2}} \\\\end{align} = \\\\left (1-\\\\frac{2}{N^2} \\\\right )\\\\left(V_{t-1}-\\\\frac{V_1}{\\\\frac{2}{N^2}}\\\\right) = \\\\left (1-\\\\frac{2}{N^2} \\\\right)^{t-1} \\\\left(V_1-\\\\frac{V_1}{\\\\frac{2}{N^2}}\\\\right) yields : V_t = V_1 \\\\frac{1-\\\\left (1-\\\\frac{2}{N^2} \\\\right)^t}{\\\\frac{2}{N^2}} as desired. \\\\---- }} The probability of A to reach fixation is called fixation probability. For the simple Moran process this probability is Since all individuals have the same fitness, they also have the same chance of becoming the ancestor of the whole population; this probability is and thus the sum of all i probabilities (for all A individuals) is just The mean time to absorption starting in state i is given by : k_i = N \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\\\frac{N-i}{N-j} + \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^{N-1} \\\\frac{i}{j} \\\\right] {q_i} The variable y_i^{j} = k_{i}^j- k_{i-1}^j is used and the equation becomes : \\\\begin{align} y_{i+1}^{j} &= y_i^{j} -\\\\frac{\\\\delta_{ij}}{q_i}   \\\\sum_{i=1}^m y_i^{j} &= (k_{1}^j- k_{0}^j) + (k_{2}^j- k_{1}^j) + \\\\cdots + (k_{m-1}^j- k_{m-2}^j) + (k_{m}^j- k_{m-1}^j)  &= k_{m}^j - k_{0}^j  \\\\sum_{i=1}^m y_i^{j} &= k_{m}^j   y_1^{j} &= (k_{1}^j- k_{0}^j) = k_{1}^j  y_2^{j} &= y_1^{j} -\\\\frac{\\\\delta_{1j}}{q_1} = k_1^{j} -\\\\frac{\\\\delta_{1j}}{ q_1 }  y_3^{j} &= k_1^{j} -\\\\frac{\\\\delta_{1j}}{q_1} -\\\\frac{\\\\delta_{2j}}{ q_2 }  & \\\\vdots  y_i^{j} &= k_1^{j} -\\\\sum_{r=1}^{i-1} \\\\frac{\\\\delta_{rj}}{q_r} = \\\\begin{cases} k_1^j & j \\\\geq i k_1^j - \\\\frac{1}{q_j} & j \\\\leq i \\\\end{cases}   k_i^j &= \\\\sum_{m=1}^i y_m^{j} = \\\\begin{cases} i \\\\cdot k_1^j & j \\\\geq i i \\\\cdot k_1^j - \\\\frac{i-j}{q_j} & j \\\\leq i \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} Knowing that k_N^j = 0 and :q_j = P_{j,j+1}=\\\\frac{j}{N} \\\\frac{N-j}{N} we can calculate k_1^j: : \\\\begin{align} k_N^j = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m y_i^{j} = N \\\\cdot k_1^j &\\\\- \\\\frac{N-j}{q_j} = 0  k_1^j &= \\\\frac{N}{j} \\\\end{align} Therefore : k_i^j = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{i}{j} \\\\cdot k_j^j & j \\\\geq i \\\\frac{N - i}{N-j} \\\\cdot k_j^j & j \\\\leq i\\\\end{cases} with k_j^j = N. Now , the total time until fixation starting from state i, can be calculated : \\\\begin{align} k_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}k_i^j &= \\\\sum_{j=1}^{i}k_i^j + \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^{N-1}k_i^j  &= \\\\sum_{j=1}^{i}N \\\\frac{N-i}{N-j} + \\\\sum_{j=i+1}^{N-1}N \\\\frac{i}{j} \\\\end{align} \\\\---- }} For large N the approximation : \\\\lim_{N\\\\to \\\\infty} k_i \\\\approx -N^2 \\\\left[ (1-x_i) \\\\ln(1-x_i) + x_i \\\\ln(x_i) \\\\right] holds. Selection If one allele has a fitness advantage over the other allele, it will be more likely to be chosen for reproduction. This can be incorporated into the model if individuals with allele A have fitness f_i and individuals with allele B have fitness where i is the number of individuals of type A; thus describing a general birth-death process. The transition matrix of the stochastic process is tri-diagonal in shape and the transition probabilities are : \\\\begin{align} P_{i,i-1} &= \\\\frac{g_i (N-i) }{f_i \\\\cdot i + g_i (N-i)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{i}{N} P_{i,i} &= 1- P_{i,i-1} - P_{i,i+1} P_{i,i+1} &= \\\\frac{f_i \\\\cdot i}{f_i \\\\cdot i + g_i (N-i)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{N-i}{N} \\\\end{align} The entry P_{i,j} denotes the probability to go from state i to state j. To understand the formulas for the transition probabilities one has to look again at the definition of the process and see that the fitness enters only the first term in the equations which is concerned with reproduction. Thus the probability that individual A is chosen for reproduction is not i / N any more but dependent on the fitness of A and thus :\\\\frac{f_i \\\\cdot i}{f_i \\\\cdot i + g_i (N-i)}. Also in this case, fixation probabilities when starting in state i is defined by recurrence : x_i = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & i=0 \\\\beta_i x_{i-1}+(1-\\\\alpha_i-\\\\beta_i)x_i+\\\\alpha_ix_{i+1} & 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq N-1 1 & i =N \\\\end{cases} And the closed form is given by : x_i = \\\\frac{{\\\\displaystyle 1 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\gamma_k}} {{\\\\displaystyle 1 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\gamma_k}} \\\\qquad \\\\text{(1)} where \\\\gamma_i = P_{i,i-1} / P_{i,i+1} per definition and will just be g_i / f_i for the general case. {{hiddenbg1=#f2dfce;contentcss=border:1px #C4C3D0solid; headercss=color:black; header=For a mathematical derivation of the equation above, click on \\"show\\" to revealcontent=Also in this case, fixation probabilities can be computed, but the transition probabilities are not symmetric. The notation P_{i,i+1}=\\\\alpha_i, P_{i,i-1}=\\\\beta_i, P_{i,i}=1-\\\\alpha_i- \\\\beta_i and \\\\gamma_i = \\\\beta_i / \\\\alpha_i is used. The fixation probability can be defined recursively and a new variable y_i = x_i - x_{i-1} is introduced. : \\\\begin{align} x_i &= \\\\beta_i x_{i-1} + (1-\\\\alpha_i - \\\\beta_i)x_i + \\\\alpha_i x_{i+1}  \\\\beta_i (x_i - x_{i-1} ) &= \\\\alpha_i (x_{i+1} - x_i )  \\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot y_i &= y_{i+1} \\\\end{align} Now two properties from the definition of the variable can be used to find a closed form solution for the fixation probabilities: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i &= x_m && 1 y_k &= x_1 \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{l=1}^{k-1}\\\\gamma_l && 2 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\sum_{m=1}^{i}y_m &= x_1 + x_1 \\\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\gamma_k = x_i && 3 \\\\end{align} Combining (3) and : :x_1 \\\\left(1 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\gamma_k \\\\right) = x_N = 1. which implies: :x_1 = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\gamma_k} This in turn gives us: : x_i = \\\\frac{{\\\\displaystyle 1 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\gamma_k}}{{\\\\displaystyle 1 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\\\\prod_{k=1}^{j}\\\\gamma_k}} \\\\---- }} This general case where the fitness of A and B depends on the abundance of each type is studied in evolutionary game theory. Less complex results are obtained if a constant fitness difference r is assumed. Individuals of type A reproduce with a constant rate r and individuals with allele B reproduce with rate 1. Thus if A has a fitness advantage over B, r will be larger than one, otherwise it will be smaller than one. Thus the transition matrix of the stochastic process is tri-diagonal in shape and the transition probabilities are : \\\\begin{align} P_{0,0}&=1 P_{i,i-1} &= \\\\frac{N-i}{r \\\\cdot i + N-i} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{i}{N} P_{i,i} &= 1- P_{i,i-1} - P_{i,i+1} P_{i,i+1} &= \\\\frac{r \\\\cdot i}{r \\\\cdot i + N-i} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{N-i}{N} P_{N,N}&=1. \\\\end{align} In this case \\\\gamma_i = 1/r is a constant factor for each composition of the population and thus the fixation probability from equation (1) simplifies to : x_i = \\\\frac{1-r^{-i}} { 1-r^{-N} } \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad x_1 = \\\\rho = \\\\frac{1-r^{-1}} {1-r^{-N}} \\\\qquad \\\\text{(2)} where the fixation probability of a single mutant A in a population of otherwise all B is often of interest and is denoted by . Also in the case of selection, the expected value and the variance of the number of A individuals may be computed : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}[ X(t) \\\\mid X(t-1) = i ] &= p s \\\\dfrac{1-p}{p s + 1} + i  \\\\operatorname{Var}( X(t+1) \\\\mid X(t)=i) &=p(1-p)\\\\dfrac{ (s+1) + (p s + 1)^2 }{(p s +1)^2} \\\\end{align} where and . Rate of evolution In a population of all B individuals, a single mutant A will take over the whole population with the probability : \\\\rho = \\\\frac{1-r^{-1}}{1-r^{-N}}. \\\\qquad \\\\text{(2)} If the mutation rate (to go from the B to the A allele) in the population is u then the rate with which one member of the population will mutate to A is given by and the rate with which the whole population goes from all B to all A is the rate that a single mutant A arises times the probability that it will take over the population (fixation probability): : R = N \\\\cdot u \\\\cdot \\\\rho = u \\\\quad \\\\text{if} \\\\quad \\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{N}. Thus if the mutation is neutral (i.e. the fixation probability is just 1/N) then the rate with which an allele arises and takes over a population is independent of the population size and is equal to the mutation rate. This important result is the basis of the neutral theory of evolution and suggests that the number of observed point mutations in the genomes of two different species would simply be given by the mutation rate multiplied by two times the time since divergence. Thus the neutral theory of evolution provides a molecular clock, given that the assumptions are fulfilled which may not be the case in reality.

His professional playing career extended from 1947 through 1954. In 1949, Brittin won 21 games for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class B Interstate League. He was recalled by the pennant-bound 1950 Phillies in September from Triple-A. In Brittin‚Äôs big league debut, he pitched a scoreless inning in a marathon, 19-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Cincinnati was ahead, 5‚Äì2, when Brittin relieved Robin Roberts in the eighth. Brittin retired the Reds in order, then was removed for a pinch hitter. The Phillies tied the game in the ninth, and then again in the 18th frame, and won it 8‚Äì7 in their half of the 19th. In six total games pitched in MLB, all in relief, Brittin had a 0‚Äì0 record with a 6.75 earned run average (ERA).

His cousin Adam Christodoulou is also a British Racing Driver. CareerKarting= Christodoulou began racing in 1996, and has raced karts in the UK, Italy, France, Belgium, including winning at Spa, and in Japan. However, it wasn't until 1999 when he started to make waves on the British karting circuit. He won the Shennington Kart Club's Formula Cadet class, edging out cousin Adam by only two points - 217 to 215. Both Christodoulous struggled the following season, with Adam coming 7th and Riki 14th. Riki got the edge on Adam in the National Cadet Championship, with Riki finishing 5th, 60 points behind champion Alexander Sims. After a somewhat disappointing 2001 in the TKM class, Riki moved into the Intercontinental A Junior class for 2002. 5th place in the Super 1 JICA Championship led him towards a championship campaign in 2003. He did indeed win the championship, edging out Freddie Martin-Dye by just 2 points. He and Martin-Dye both moved up into the main ICA class, and Riki finished joint third in the championship - amazingly missing out on the title by 3 points, finishing tied with Dan Cruttenden. Formula A beckoned and Riki ended 2005 with two runner-up positions - losing to Jason Edgar in the British Open and Mark Litchfield in Super 1 (Riki tied with Gary Catt and Jason Parrott for second). Riki's final season of karting came in 2006, when he had another 2nd - this time coming in the European Championship - beaten only by legendary Italian Marco Ardig√≤. =Formula Renault= Riki moved up to Formula Renault for the 2006 UK Winter Series. Driving for Fortec Motorsports team, Riki finished 5th in the championship, which was dominated by French interloper Franck Mailleux. He competed in the main championship for the first time in 2007. Riki had a solid season, with 7 podiums including a maiden victory coming at the final round at Thruxton leaving him sixth in the championship. Another Winter Series campaign followed, and while the series was dominated the non-points-scoring Valtteri Bottas, Christo finished runner-up behind Richard Singleton. Riki also won a round of the Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup at Oschersleben. A sophomore season of FRUK occurred in 2008, and again Riki scored consistently, with nine podiums and two wins for a fifth place overall championship standing. Cousin Adam went on to win the title with 7 wins and eleven podiums. =Formula Three= Riki was looking to move up into the British Formula 3 Championship for the 2009 season, and at the first pre-season test, Riki was underneath the Formula Three lap record at Snetterton. On 3 April 2009 Christodoulou signed a deal to drive for Fortec Motorsport in the series. Riki took his first win in the series at Snetterton, holding off championship leader Daniel Ricciardo, Walter Grubm√ºller and Renger van der Zande. He had one win and four podiums in 2009, unfortunately having 5 DNF's during the season, costing him a lot of points. He finished fifth overall in the championship standings, also being the Top Rookie. Christodoulou returned to Formula Renault UK in 2010 for the last half of the season with CRS Racing for one round, then Fortec Motorsport for the latter and finished 11th in points with one win and four podiums. He returned to British F3 in 2011 for three race meetings and finished 12th in points for Hitech Racing with one win and three podiums. =Sports cars= In 2012 Christodoulou left open-wheel cars for sports cars and competed in the GT3 class of the British GT Championship in a Team WFR Ginetta G55. He competed in seven races but failed to score.

The 2018 Cheltenham Science Festival (6 - 11 June) was held in Imperial Square, Cheltenham. Introduction and History The youngest of the Cheltenham Festivals, the Cheltenham Science Festival was first held in 2002, and has quickly grown to become one of the most significant of its kind in the UK. Guests and Directors Co-Directors Kathy Sykes and Mark Lythgoe at the 2009 Cheltenham Science Festival The guest directors for Cheltenham Science Festival 2017 are television presenter and actor Dallas Campbell and former NASA Chief Scientist Ellen Stofan. The Festival has attracted many significant names in Science over the years, including Robert Winston (the first 'guest director' in 2004), David Puttnam (Director 2005), Jonathon Porritt (Director 2007), Adam Hart-Davis, Susan Greenfield, Richard Dawkins, Lucy Hawking, A. C. Grayling, Tony Robinson and Richard Hammond. In 2014 the guest directors were BAFTA winning naturalist Steve Backshall and radio and TV presenter Richard Bacon. Programme The Cheltenham Science Festival aims to engage in entertaining, challenging and deliberately discussing controversial issues and experiences. The 2017 programme contains over 140 events across six-days, including a number of dedicated family events. =Discover Zone= A main feature of the festival is the Discover Zone. Billed as 'Interactive Science for all ages', it is a free interactive exhibition space that takes up the main space of Cheltenham's Town Hall. =FameLab= FameLab was set up in 2005 by Cheltenham Science Festival in partnership with NESTA. In Famelab, contestants give short (maximum three minute) presentations unaided by slides on an area of science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) that they have been researching. They aim to give their presentation in a way that engages the general public, not simply scientists etc. who already have technical or specific knowledge on the area. This point is taken into account by the judging panel, usually science communicators themselves, who assess the communicators on clarity, content and communication before deciding whom to put through to the next round of competition. Famelab has regional heats in its participating countries, followed by national finals and then the international finals taking place every year at Cheltenham Science Festival. In 2007, the competition was adopted by the British Council as one of its flagship science engagement projects, first as a South East Europe pilot. By 2010, Famelab expanded to include 14 nations across Europe, Asia and Africa, setting the stage for a growing global phenomenon. In 2015 the competition operated in 30 locations including the USA via NASA, 29 of which participated in international finals in June 2015. The International Grand Final at the Cheltenham Science Festival in June 2015 was streamed on the internet throughout the world. At Cheltenham Science Festival the International Finals of Famelab consist of three international semi-finals where judges listen to the three-minute presentations from the international finalists, then ask them questions about the topic of the contestant's talk before deliberating on which scientists to select for the international final, held at the end of the festival in the 800-seater Arena. Former Material World radio presenter Quentin Cooper was compere during the final. Over 4,000 young science communicators (\\"Famelabbers\\") have participated in Famelab competitions in their home countries, about 100 of which also represented their home countries at the Cheltenham Science Festival in the UK. It is fairly common in Famelab competitions that a Famelabber may not originate in the country they represent at the international finals, such as Bechara Saab (originally from Canada), who was the first to represent Switzerland at the International Grand Final, and Didac Carmona (originally from Spain), who represented Austria and won the International Grand Final in 2012. Famelab International 2014 was won by P√°draic Flood, originally from Ireland, representing the tripartite Benelux. Also at the International Final two joint runners-up are announced as decided by the final judges, an audience winner voted for by the live audience in the arena via keypad is crowned and finally an alumni award is given to the winner of a worldwide online vote by juries in all the participating Famelab nations.

During this time, Miller oversaw a significant expansion of the college and was constantly active in the governance of the University of Cambridge. Life He was born at Acklington Park, the son of a shepherd. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Morpeth and went on to excel at St John's College, Cambridge, specialising in medieval history. Having grown up on a farm, he was drawn to questions of medieval agriculture and the peasants whose labour had sustained the clergy. After a professorship at the University of Sheffield he returned to his alma mater, Cambridge University, where he was elected to high office as the Master of Fitzwilliam College (1971‚Äì81). At Cambridge he also chaired the Victoria County History committee and the History of Parliament Trust. Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge Works With John Hatcher, he wrote Medieval England: Rural Society and Economic Change, 1086‚Äì1348 (1978), which soon became a standard work for students. A companion volume by the same authors, Medieval England: Towns, Commerce and Crafts, 1086‚Äì1348 appeared in 1995.

The project tries to solve 3 core problems facing web application developers: * How do you express page navigation rules? * How do you manage navigation and conversational state? * How do you facilitate modularization and reuse? In Spring Web Flow, a web flow answers all of the above questions: it captures navigational rules allowing the Spring Web Flow execution engine to manage a conversation and the associated state. At the same time, a web flow is a reusable web application module. Since version 2.0, Spring Web Flow also introduces other additional features supporting the construction of rich web applications, such as AJAX support and tight integration with JavaServer Faces. History The Spring Web Flow project started as a simple extension to the Spring Web MVC framework providing web flow functionality, developed by Erwin Vervaet in 2004. In 2005 the project was introduced into the Spring portfolio by Keith Donald and grew into the official Spring sub-project it is now. The first production ready 1.0 release was made on 2006-10-26. Version 2.0, first released on 2008-04-29, saw a major internal reorganization of the framework to allow better integration with JavaServer Faces.

However, this phenomenon is an optical illusion that is seen from the Earth. The antitail is formed of larger dust particles, which are less affected by the Sun's radiation pressure and tend to remain roughly in the comet's orbital plane and eventually form a disc along the comet's orbit due to the ejection speed of the particles from the comet's surface. As Earth passes through the comet's orbital plane, this disc is seen side on, and appears as the characteristic spike. The other side of the disc can sometimes be seen, though it tends to be lost in the dust tail. The antitail is therefore normally visible for a brief interval only when Earth passes through the comet's orbital plane. Most comets do not develop sufficiently for an antitail to become visible, but notable comets that did display antitails include Comet Arend‚ÄìRoland in 1957, Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp in 1997, and Comet PANSTARRS in 2013.

It became No. 603 Squadron RAF in January 1945. HistoryFormation and World War I= No. 229 Squadron RAF was formed on 20 August 1918 at Great Yarmouth. It was made up from Nos 428, 429, 454 and 455 Flights of the Royal Naval Air Service. The squadron's role was to fly coastal patrols. It continued with this until the end of the war and was officially disbanded on 31 December 1919. =World War II= On 6 October 1939, 229 Sqn was reformed at RAF Digby as a Fighter squadron and was equipped with Blenheims for a role protecting shipping. The squadron began convoy patrols on 21 December but also carried out night training and radar trials. In March 1940, the squadron was re-equipped with Hurricanes and soon after the German invasion of France in May 1940, sent one flight to reinforce the French-based fighter squadrons for eight days during the Battle of France. After flying defensive patrols over the East Coast, No 229 moved to RAF Northolt in September and remained there for the rest of the Battle of Britain. ACM (then Sqn Ldr) Frederick Rosier was a flight commander on the squadron during this time. In December 1940 the squadron moved to Merseyside and in May 1941 left for the Middle East. The squadron's pilots were embarked in and flown off to Malta where, after refuelling, they moved on to Egypt, two separate detachments being convoyed fifteen days apart by the carrier. On arrival the first detachment was attached to No. 274 Squadron RAF to cover the evacuation of Crete and the second detachment was divided between Nos. 6, 208 and 213 Squadrons. A flight was transferred from No. 274 to No.73 Squadron on 11 June as the latters C Flight, and remained detached in Egypt at the end of July. It was September before the squadron began functioning as an independent unit. Fighter sweeps were flown over Libya until the end of March 1942 when the squadron was transferred to Malta to reinforce the islands fighter defences. On 29 April 1942, it ceased to function, its surviving aircraft and pilots being absorbed by other units. On 3 August 1942, 229 Sqn reformed at Takali, Malta from No. 603 Squadron and flew Spitfires in Defence of Malta during the last months of the siege. In January 1943 the island's squadrons took the offensive, flying sweeps over Sicily, and in May 229 Sqn began to operate fighter-bombers. After covering the landings in Sicily, in July 1943, the squadron remained in Malta for defensive duties until January 1944, when it moved to Sicily. On 1 April 1944, it was withdrawn for transfer to the UK and re-assembled at RAF Hornchurch on 24 April. During Operation Overlord (the Allied invasion of Normandy) it was equipped with the Spitfire IX F, operating from RAF Detling in Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB), though under the operational control of RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2nd TAF).Delve, p. 137. After providing escort missions over the Low countries it re-equipped with Spitfire XVIs in December, and then flew fighter-bomber sweeps until renumbered No. 603 Squadron RAF on 10 January 1945.

The dolls had different costumes and personalities. Star Fairies was adapted into a televised special, made by Hanna-Barbera in 1985. Family Home Entertainment released the special on VHS in 1986. Television film The film is about a princess Star Fairy named Sparkle (B.J. Ward) who lives up in the clouds in Castle WishStar. Sparkle's job is to grant wishes to children who wish upon a star, but lately she has been overwhelmed by the increasing number of wishes being made. So she asks for help from the Wishing Well (Jonathan Winters), who instructs her to go to Mount Wishmore and wish on a shooting star. She does so and receives five new star fairy helpers named: True Love (Jean Casem), Whisper (Noelle North), Jazz (Susan Blu), Spice (Didi Conn), and Nightsong (Ta-Tanisha). As the story goes on, the fairies meet a little girl named Hillary (Drew Barrymore), who is upset but cannot think of a wish to make her happy. Hillary and other Star Fairies then seek help from Princess Sparkle. When Hillary and the Star Fairies return to Castle WishStar, they discover Princess Sparkle's Wand has been stolen by a group of short, hairy elves, and their leader, Bungle Boss, who have also made off with the Wishing Well.

It was founded in Paris in 2004 by leaders in the French Roman Catholic and Jewish communities. YIU is led by Father Patrick Desbois, a Catholic priest whose grandfather was a French soldier deported to the Nazi prison camp Rava-Ruska, located in a Ukrainian town that borders Poland. Its United States fundraising branch is known as the American Friends of Yahad-In Unum. Leadership Father Patrick Desbois is the director of the Episcopal Committee for Relations with Judaism. His work on Catholic-Jewish relations has frequently received international recognition; he has received the L√©gion d'honneur from French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and been awarded the Medal of Valor by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Roger E. Joseph Prize by Hebrew Union College, the Humanitarian Award by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Jan Karski Award by the American Jewish Committee, the B'nai B'rith International Award for Outstanding Contributions to Relations with the Jewish People and the National Jewish Book Award for his 2008 book Holocaust by Bullets (Palgrave-Macmillan). In 2009, he received honorary doctorates from Hebrew University and Bar Ilan, 2012 from the New York University. Dr. Richard Prasquier is the vice-president of the Yahad-In Unum Board. He is the president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions and a member of the World Jewish Congress and the International Jewish Committee on Inter-religious Consultations. David Black is the president of American Friends of Yahad-In Unum. Black is the associate vice president for Institutional Advancement for Yeshiva University. He is the former director of the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan and executive director of the Alliance Francaise in New York. Historical background In less than two years, from June 1941 until the spring of 1943, an estimated 1.25 million Jews were massacred in the Soviet Union by Nazi mobile killing units, or Einsatzgruppen. The Einsatzgruppen rounded up the Jewish populations of the villages and towns they passed through, led them to the country-side and summarily executed them. The victims were buried (many of them still alive) in mass graves. Very little is known about these atrocities because there were so few survivors. Research YIU seeks to find evidence of the massacres on the Eastern front and locate the mass graves of Jews killed by the Einsatzgruppen. YIU's objective is to counter the claims of Holocaust deniers who use the lack of official documentation of the murders to make claims about the validity of Holocaust evidence, and to account for the graves that remain undiscovered to pay respect to the dead. YIU approaches its work on two fronts‚Äîarchival research and research trips. The archival research is primarily undertaken by PhD and graduate students in the United States and Germany. The researchers spend several months at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, where they study the Soviet archives of the Extraordinary State Commission of 1944 and the archives from the Einsatzgruppen Trial at Ludwigsburg, Germany. After the research is complete, an 11-person team, usually led by Patrick Desbois, travels to Belarus and Ukraine to collect testimonial and forensic evidence of the murders. Each trip lasts 15‚Äì20 days. The team includes a photographer, ballistics expert, translators, drivers, daily report recorders, a witness interviewer and camera operator. During each trip, the team travels from village to village, where they interview and film the surviving eyewitnesses, using testimony of witnesses to discover the locations of the graves. Once the graves are located, the team uses high-tech equipment to obtain forensic evidence that validates the testimonies. When the team returns to Paris, the translated video testimony and the physical evidence is archived. Publications In August 2008, Palgrave MacMillan published Holocaust By Bullets, written by Father Desbois about the work of YIU. Father Desbois titled the book after one of the methods the Nazis used to kill their victims. The Jewish Book Council awarded the book the 2008 National Jewish Book Award. In June 2014, YIU published its ten-year anniversary book. Called Broad Daylight, the book encapsulates the horror of the Jewish genocide in which Germans in Eastern Europe massacred the Jews in broad daylight. The bilingual book (written in French and English) covers each territory that the organization has researched, splitting each into a chapter. These include, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Poland, Romania, Moldova and Lithuania. Future projects Since 2009, the Archives and Research Center (CERRESE - Centre Europ√©en de Ressources pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement sur la Shoah √† l'Est), a unique research center in Paris, features unique archival resources and the new results from Father Desbois' field research, including video testimonies and artifacts.YIU website The organization is also expanding InEvidence, an interactive map on its website, on which users can see the extent to which the Nazis attempted to wipe out the Jewish population in remote villages. The map covers all the countries in which the organization has expanded its research. It enables users to choose a specific country and location and to read information about the testimonies and/or watch a video regarding the town's mass murder.

During the First World War it served as a coastal defence unit, and through most of the Second World War and the 1950s it operated as a night fighter air defence squadron. Three commanders of the squadron went on to be Chiefs of the Air Staff, two of the RAF and one of the Royal Pakistani Air Force. First World War The squadron was formed in August 1918, by merging No. 442, 555, 556 and 470 Flights. It operated a mixture of aircraft, including seaplanes, Airco DH.9 bombers, and Sopwith Camel fighters, and was responsible for the defence of the Thames Estuary. It was disbanded in early 1920, following the end of the war. Second World War It reformed in October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, operating Bristol Blenheims from RAF Catterick. Whilst it was intended to carry out shipping protection missions, it began to be used as a night fighter unit after becoming fully operational in February 1940; in October, it was moved to RAF Redhill, near London, and converted to the Bristol Beaufighter. In December, it moved to RAF Tangmere in Sussex, continuing in its operational role. It moved back to north England in mid 1942, to RAF Acklington and later RAF Scorton; in May 1943, the squadron was transferred to North Africa, where it was dispersed between various ports to provide night fighter defence. In September 1943 it operated a number of aircraft from Sicily, but moved back to the UK in January 1944 to join the newly forming Second Tactical Air Force in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. It re-equipped with de Havilland Mosquito night fighters, first Mk. 17 and later Mk. 30 models, and flew intruder missions over north-western Europe from RAF Woodvale, RAF Honiley, RAF Bradwell Bay and RAF Hunsdon. It moved to bases in France in October 1944, returning to the UK after the end of hostilities in August 1945, and was disbanded in September 1946. Cold War The squadron reformed in March 1951 at RAF Kabrit in the Suez Canal Zone, again as a night fighter squadron operating Mosquitoes. In October 1952 it received its first Gloster Meteor jet fighters, and was fully re-equipped with Meteors by April 1953. The squadron disbanded in September 1954, but was reformed again in September 1955 at RAF Driffield, with de Havilland Venom NF.2. After two further years of operating in this role, it was disbanded for the fourth time in mid-1957. Notable members Notable members of the unit included: *Richard Atcherley, later Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Pakistani Air Force, who commanded the squadron on its formation in 1939. *Archie Boyd, DSO, DFC. Commanded the squadron in 1943 and was a flying ace with 10 aerial victories. *John Grandy, later Chief of the Air Staff, who briefly commanded the squadron in 1940. *Thomas Pike, later Chief of the Air Staff, who commanded the squadron in 1941. *John Topham, DFC and Bar.

His first musical experiences with the Gialdino Gialdini Musical Band in early 70s. Sergio Maltagliati, 2008 Biography Sergio Maltagliati an artist from Florence Italy; studied music at the Conservatory \\"Luigi Cherubini\\" in Florence, then he began to paint. Thus creating a new method of writing music where the score becomes a visual composition. The relation between the sound and color creates a living feeling that art is not dead. It does not stop at the artist's last attempt at the canvas, but goes beyond to the viewer. It is the relationship between artist and viewer, one is no different from the other. Now the viewer can take the step that the artist may dare not to across. It is the point of translation a fear to most artist that want to create and let their work go. This kind of art allows the viewer to create with the artist and create so much more. Sergio Maltagliati has always been deeply interested in a multimedia concept of art. His education, in both music and the visual arts, has placed him in the position to incorporate sign, colour, and sound into a unitary concept of multiple perception, through analogies, contrasts, stratifications, and associations. At present he is a teacher professor. He's a composer who joined, at the end of the eighties, the Florentine artistic current, that has been active since the end of World War II up to the present, including Sylvano Bussotti, Giuseppe Chiari, Giancarlo Cardini, Albert Mayr, Marcello Aitiani, Daniele Lombardi, Pietro Grossi. These musicians have experimented the interaction among sound, sign and vision, a synaesthetics of art derived from historical avant-gardes, from Kandinskij to futurism, to Scrjabin and Schoenberg, all the way to Bauhaus. His work in the eighties is also based in involving, with didactic-educational projects, students as executors of performances in the example of the Music Circus carried out in 1984 in a High School in Piemonte by John Cage. And it is the American musician (met in 1991 in Zurich for the execution of Europeras 1&2) who appreciates this aspect of Maltagliati's work, because he is able to involve young people as performers. These works, besides building approach to music and, specifically, developing a different way of listening, aim at expanding the concept of artistic creation to the executor, till it reaches just the user, often unprovided with a traditional artistic formation. letter written by John Cage Since 1997, Sergio Maltagliati has dealt principally in music on the Internet and one of his first compositions intended for the network, netOper@ a new, and the first Italian interactive work for the Web starting in the spring of 1997. The interactive work will be presented simultaneously in real and cyberspace. The Opera is realized with the collaboration of Pietro Grossi, the legendary father of Italian music informatics. The essential aspect to Sergio Maltagliati's approach is the idea that art is not just the fruit of the composer, the creation is always the fruit of collaboration. Two of his works are strongly based on this concept: neXtOper@_1.03 (2001) a work for mobile phones, and midi_Visu@lMusiC (2005) music and images on I-Mode mobile phone. In 1999, he writes the program autom@tedVisualMusiC, software from experiences of the visual HomeArt programs designed by Grossi in the '80s, written in the language BBC Basic with computer Acorn Archimedes A310, a project that creates abstract designs and sound by using programming to make the piece interactive and adds movement. This artwork not only has visually pieces, but also is interactive. In 2001, he has participated in the project Interview yourself by Amy Alexander.

In the structure of the work, the traditional role between audience and stage has been reversed on purpose. The interpreters have occupied, geometrically, the vast space of the room putting the public first on the stage and causing them, then, to move around the sound and visual groups. The musical part is based on the interdisciplinary value of music, inspired by John Cage's research on the principle of \\"capturing and controlling the noises as musical elements\\". The choreographic and scenic part of the work, made by painter Edoardo Salvi was an uninterrupted dynamism of forms and spatial situations, connecting image to signs and sound.Music around the Cage Innocenti Hospital -scenography-(Florence 1985) *1989 Revolution The visual part of the work is composed of a big painting, of about three hundred square metres, on which two hundred high school students have worked.

HistoryIn World War I= The squadron was formed on 20 August 1918 from No's 333, 334 and 335 Flights at Royal Naval Air Station RNAS Felixstowe and equipped with Felixstowe F.2 and Felixstowe F.3 flying boats. It carried out anti-submarine patrols over the North Sea until the end of the war. It disbanded on 5 January 1919 at Felixtowe. =In World War II=In Scotland Reformed from 'B' Flight of No. 3 Squadron RAF at RAF Sumburgh on 17 July 1940 as a Hawker Hurricane unit, it remained in Scotland on defensive duties until April 1941, when it was earmarked for the Middle East. On 10 May its ground echelon was embarked but the aircrew were carrying out ferrying duties, consequently the ground echelon was disembarked and the squadron moved to RAF Ouston, where it continued its defensive role. In the Far East In November the squadron finally departed for the Middle East, but on arriving in South Africa, it was diverted to the Far East following the Japanese invasion of Malaya. Although the ground echelon arrived in Singapore, by the time the air echelon, aboard , was within flying off range, there were no airfields left in British hands, so the squadron flew off to Java on 27 January 1942. Both echelons met up again on 2 February at Palembang in Sumatra, but a further withdrawal to Java was required following the Japanese invasion of Sumatra. By mid February 1942, the situation regarding serviceability was so grave, that No 232 was merged with No 242 and its ground crews were evacuated to Ceylon. Here they were re- allocated to other units and No 232 ceased to exist on 26 February. In North Africa and Italy The squadron reformed at RAF Atcham on 10 April 1942 as a Spitfire unit becoming operational in May. In August it moved to RAF Debden, from where it flew offensive sweeps over France including operations supporting the Dieppe Raid, but in September it moved to RAF Turnhouse and began preparing for overseas deployment once again. Leaving the UK in November, the ground echelon arrived in Gibraltar, being joined by the aircrew and aircraft in December. It moved to North Africa in early December under the command of Archibald Winskill and immediately began undertaking ground attack and fighter operations in support of 1st Army, continuing this task until the end of the North African campaign. In June 1943 the squadron moved to Malta to support the Allied invasion of Sicily before moving onto that island from where it supported the Allied landings on mainland Italy. In September it moved to airfields in Italy, but in December was re-allocated to the Lebanon for defensive duties. Re-equipped with Spitfire IXs, it moved to Corsica in April 1944 and took part in the Allied landing on the South Coast of France, remaining in France to support the Allied advance north until October 1944, when it returned to Naples and disbanded on 31 October. As Transport squadron The squadron reformed on 15 November 1944 at RAF Stoney Cross as a transport unit equipped with Wellington Mk.XVIs until 6 January 1945 when the aircraft were transferred to No 242 Squadron and the ground crews were used to form two other units, No. 243 Squadron RAF rear echelon and No. 1315 Flight RAF. However, the squadron was not disbanded and it immediately received new aircraft, in the form of Liberators, and crews. These were taken to India in February where it immediately began carrying out transport flights throughout South-East Asia. In July some Douglas Skymaster Mk.Is were received and these were used to fly a Ceylon-Australia service until February 1946, when the Skymasters were returned to the UK, but the service was then resumed in March, the Skymasters having been replaced by Lancastrians. The squadron finally disbanded on 15 August 1946 at Poona, its routes being taken over by civilian airlines in the meantime. ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Halley, James J.

The castle is primarily of the 17th century, though with later additions. In the 19th century it was the home of Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey, and became known for its literary gatherings. It is a category B listed building.  History  Craigcrook Castle in the 1830s The lands of Craigcrook were, in the 14th century, in the possession of the Graham family. In 1362 the lands were given to the chaplains of St. Giles' Cathedral. They passed through several more owners before 1542, when William Adamson, a merchant and burgess of Edinburgh, took possession. Adamson owned large estates in what is now north- western Edinburgh, including Craigleith, Groathill and Clermiston. Adamson was killed at the Battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547. The Adamson family constructed, or reconstructed, Craigcrook Castle, and owned it until 1659, when it was sold to John Mein, a merchant in Edinburgh. Ten years later it became the home of Sir John Hall of Dunglass, who later was the Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1689. Hall sold the property in 1682 to Walter Pringle, advocate, who in turn sold it, in 1689, to John Strachan, Writer to the Signet. On Strachan's death in 1719, his property, including Craigcrook Castle, was left for charitable purposes. The charitable Craigcrook Mortification, which was set up on the death of John Strachan, retains ownership of the castle and grounds. In 1707 Strachan's servant, Helen Bell, was infamously murdered beneath the Castle Rock in Edinburgh, en route to Craigcrook and the murderers used her key to enter Strachan's Edinburgh townhouse, where they stole ¬£900 in silver coin and ¬£100 in gold coin. Only one of the two men were punished for the crime: William Thomson being hanged in the Grassmarket for his crimes.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh vol.5 p.119 It is not known when the castle itself was constructed. From the style of building, the majority of the castle has been dated to the early 17th century. However, the nature of the vaulting inside suggests that the core of an earlier fortalice was extensively rebuilt or extended at this time. Archibald Constable, the publisher, occupied it until 1815 and his son Thomas Constable was born here in 1812. It then became the home of the lawyer and literary critic Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey (1773‚Äì1850). Soon after he took on the tenancy, Jeffrey added a drawing room wing to the north, and in 1818 commissioned David Roberts to decorate the library. In 1835 he commissioned William Playfair to remodel the main building and rebuild the east. During the tenancies of Constable and Jeffrey Sir Walter Scott visited the castle frequently. Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn was also a frequent guest over a period of 34 years.grant's Old and New edinburgh vol.5 p.110 The castle is said to be haunted by Lord Jeffrey.Coventry, Martin (2001) The Castles of Scotland. Goblinshead. p.153 Another 19th-century tenant was the writer and politician William Stirling who, in 1855, offered the use of the grounds to the English poet Gerald Massey, then in Edinburgh as an editor on the Edinburgh News. Massey subsequently wrote the poem Craigcrook Castle, considered to be one of his most accomplished poems in blank verse. The tenant after Jeffrey's death was John Hunter Watt. Craigcrook Castle was known during the 19th century for its literary soir√©es; among the guests were Charles Dickens, Hans Christian Andersen, George Eliot and Lord Tennyson. A billiard room was added to the east by Robert Croall in about 1891, the architect being Thomas Leadbetter. Another extension was added, after the property became the base for an architectural practice, in 1968. The castle was listed category A on 14 July 1966 but only received statutory protection on 14 December 1970.HES listed buildings in Edinburgh Craigcrook was the Scottish headquarters of Marine Harvest Ltd, a multinational fish-farming company, between 1986 and 2004. Benjamin Tindall Architects restored the interior in 1989. It was subsequently occupied as a commercial property for Barratt Developments (Scotland) until 2014, when it was advertised for sale as a residence.  Description  Craicrook Castle 2011 The castle is close to Corstorphine Hill, and was a fine country house convenient for the city. The history of the Parish of Cramond says, \\"To the S.W. of Drylaw, in a hollow at the foot of Corstorphine Hill, which here makes a turn or crook to the eastward, whence the name is derived, stands Craigcrook, apparently the most antient edifice in the parish\\". It originated as a Z-plan tower house, but has had numerous additions, with the result that both within and without there is a jumble of styles. There is a round tower on the south west corner, and a square tower to the north east. The main block is about , and three storeys high. The ground floor was formerly vaulted. as is the upper floor of the round tower. The round tower is in diameter. The square tower's sides are long, with the stairs at the south east angle. There is an entrance tower, built by Playfair. The castle has crow-stepped gables and pediment dormer windows. Some of the 19th century interior work of is interest, including murals by David Roberts. A 17th-century wall still encloses the garden which has a roll-moulded arched gateway, the pediment of which is dated 1626.

After the war it remained a fighter unit till 1957. In its last incarnation the squadron was in turn Operational Training Unit (OTU), Tactical Weapon Unit (TWU) and part of No. 4 Flying Training School RAF until finally disbanded in 1994. HistoryFormation and World War I= No. 234 Squadron RAF was officially formed on 20 August 1918 at RNAS Tresco in the Scilly Isles from No. 350, 351, 352 and 353 Flights, which had been equipped with amongst others Felixstowe F3's and Curtiss H.12 aircraft since February 1917. The squadron used these to patrol the Western Approaches of the English Channel and gained two DSCs, one DSM and a CGM in doing that.Walpole 2007, pp. 1-10. The unit flew its last World War I mission on 10 November 1918 and was disbanded half a year later at Tresco on 15 May 1919.Jefford 2001, p. 77. =In World War II= The squadron was reformed on 30 October 1939 at RAF Leconfield, initially equipped with three Magisters, a Battle and three biplane Gauntlets, soon to be followed by some Blenheims Mk.Ifs,Walpole 2007, p. 14. which were used flying on coastal patrols until March 1940. It then began to re-equip with Spitfires and moved to RAF Church Fenton in May 1940 when becoming operational. In June 1940 the squadron moved to RAF St Eval in Cornwall where it was based before and after the date regarded historically as the start of the Battle of Britain, 10 July. Here the unit's main duties were patrols, scrambles and convoy protection. On 15 August 234 Squadron was posted to RAF Middle Wallop, a part of No. 10 Group RAF flying in defence of Portsmouth, Southampton and other targets along the south coast. As there were fewer raids along the south coast than in the south east, about two thirds of patrols, scrambles and interceptions undertaken were flown in support of No. 11 Group RAF, as far as Kent. The squadron achieved a number of victories, including those of its inspirational force, high scoring Australian Pat Hughes and those of two long-surviving members of The Few, Bob Doe and Keith Lawrence. On the afternoon of 7 September the Luftwaffe made its first heavy daylight raid on London. 234 Squadron was amongst those scrambled to intercept the enemy bomber force as it retired; during the engagement, the squadron lost both Pat Hughes and its CO, Squadron Leader O'Brien. Two days later, the squadron was posted back to its old base at St Eval to be rested, receive replacement aircraft and train new pilots being posted in from OTUs ‚Äì Operational Training Units; the squadron had lost 18 Spitfires in 4 weeks fighting. During 1941 and 1942 the squadron was operating from various bases in the south and carried out both offensive and defensive duties but in January 1943 it was transferred to Orkney, flying at first from RAF Grimsetter with a detachment at RAF Sumburgh, and later from RAF Skeabrae.\\" Six months later the squadron returned to the South of England, firstly at RAF Church Stanton, and was soon operating over France again in preparation for Operation Overlord, the forthcoming Allied invasion of Normandy. On D-Day it was equipped with the Spitfire V LF operating from RAF Deanland as part of Air Defence of Great Britain, though under the operational control of RAF Second Tactical Air Force.Delve, p. 137. After D-Day the squadron converted to North American Mustang Mk.IIIs, which it used to provide long-range bomber escort missions from RAF North Weald and after December 1944 from RAF Bentwaters. On 1 May 1945 the squadron was moved to RAF Peterhead to provide a similar service to the RAF Coastal Command strike wings operating along the Norwegian coast, having received some additional new North American Mustang Mk.IVs (the RAF version of the P-51D Mustang) by this time.\\") =Post-war era: from Spitfires to jets= With the end of the war, the squadron reverted to Spitfire Mk.IXs and was retained as part of the post-war RAF. Jets arrived in February 1946, when Meteor F.3s replaced the Spitfires, but on 1 September the squadron was disbanded by being renumbered to No. 266 Squadron RAF. The squadron reformed at Oldenburg on 1 August 1952 in the ground attack role, equipped with Vampires FB.5 and FB.9s. In November 1953 it returned to the day fighter role when it began to receive North American Sabre F.4s, conversion being completed by January 1954. The squadron moved to RAF Geilenkirchen on 8 January 1954, where Hunter F.4s replaced the Sabres in May 1956, but following the 1957 Defence White Paper of Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys, No. 234 squadron was disbanded on 15 July 1957.\\") =With No. 229 OCU and No. 1 TWU= Hawker Hunter F.6 wearing the red nose markings of No. 234 Squadron at its base at RAF Chivenor in 1969. The squadron number popped up again when one of the squadrons of No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) at RAF Chivenor was given the number on 22 October 1958, operating Hunter F.6 and FGA.9 aircraft, to give Hunter pilots their operational training. On 2 September 1974 No. 229 OCU moved to RAF Brawdy (formerly HMS Goldcrest) with the closure of Chivenor for refurbishment and was redesignated as the Tactical Weapons Unit (TWU), with No. 234 (Reserve) Squadron remaining one of its components. When a second TWU was later formed at Chivenor the original was renamed No. 1 TWU, again with No. 234 squadron remaining one of its constituent squadrons though by now having traded in the Hunters for the new Hawk. When No. 1 TWU was disbanded on 31 August 1992, so were its component squadrons, No 79(F) and No 234.Jefford 2001, p. 196. =With No. 4 FTS= The following day however, 1 September 1992, the number was allocated to a squadron of No. 4 (Advanced) Flying Training School (AFTS) at RAF Valley, which had taken over the duties of the TWUs. The squadron continued as part of the school until 1 April 1994, when it was disbanded by being renumbered to No. 208 (Reserve) Squadron.

It was first formed in 1918 by combining number 347, 348 and 349 Flights at RAF Cattewater by the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War. It was reformed for the Second World War, the Berlin Airlift and currently is a Line Training Flight (LTF) squadron based at RAF Cosford, albeit in a non-flying capacity. It is among those officially acknowledged Battle of Britain squadrons. World War I The squadron was formed at RAF Cattewater (later RAF Mount Batten) in August 1918 by combining number 347, 348 and 349 Flights into the one squadron. All were flying boat flights and the squadron flew anti-submarine patrols until the end of the war, being reduced to a cadre on 15 May 1919. It remained as a storage unit until disbanded on 20 March 1922. World War IIBattle of Britain= July 1940 was the beginning of the Kanalkampf phase of the Battle of Britain. The Luftwaffe attacked English Channel convoys in an attempt to draw Fighter Command into combat and deplete its strength, attain air superiority, and ostensibly begin an amphibious invasion of England, codenamed Operation Sea Lion. The 10 July was the official opening of the Battle of Britain. On 16 May 1940, 238 reformed at RAF Tangmere. On 2 July 1940 the squadron was declared operational and operated the Hawker Hurricane. The squadron commenced operations from RAF Middle Wallop. The following day 238 Squadron experienced its first aerial combat with Flight Lieutenant J.C Kennedy damaged a Junkers Ju 88 from 1(F)/123 [1st staffel, Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 123‚ÄîReconnaissance Group 123] on a reconnaissance south of Middle Wallop. The Ju 88 piloted by Leutnant Wachtel suffered minor damage and Kennedy was hit by return-fire. On 13 July the squadron was given credit for two Bf 110s destroyed; one shared amongst four pilots. Channel convoys On 13 July Flight Lieutenant J.C Kennedy became the first pilot killed in action. Once again inaction with Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 123, this time with 2 staffel, Kennedy shot down Leutnant Weinbauer's Dornier Do 17P over Chesil Beach killing the crew. Kennedy appears to have suffered battle damage for he crash-landed at RAF Warmwell and was killed. A Do 17M from 4./Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 123 crash- landed back in Caen, France after being damaged in the same engagement. According to records, three pilots were credited with a shared Do 17, six more claimed two Bf 110s between them but this was marked unconfirmed. Seven days later the squadron flew standing combat patrols over convoy Bosom. Sergeant C Parkinson was killed in combat with Messerschmitt Bf 109s from JG 27, while the squadron destroyed a Heinkel He 59 floatplane from Seenotflugkommando 1; all four crew were killed. Parkinson was rescued by HMS Acheron but suffered fatal burns. 238 pilots were credited with two Bf 110s destroyed, one shared between two pilots, one Do 17 destroyed two shared amongst four pilots and one Bf 110 went unconfirmed. Fighter Command recorded the He 59 as a damaged claim, while one more Bf 109 was claimed destroyed, another as unconfirmed, while two pilots submitted a claim for another shared.

The aircraft landed with minor damage and was captured On 22 July further combat patrols enabled 238 Squadron, now led by Squadron Leader Harold Fenton to destroy two 4(F)/14 aircraft; a Do 17 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 with four crews posted missing in action in exchange for one damaged Hurricane. The squadron accounted for a Bf 109 from I./JG 27 on 26 July patrols. Twenty four hours later the unit flew as escort for convoy Bacon. The pilots claimed one Junkers Ju 87 Stuka shot down from a 40-strong formation, but could not penetrate the fighter escort further. The Ju 87 came from I/StG 77. On 1 August Fighter Command's order of battle placed 238 under the operational level command of No. 10 Group RAF, headquarters at Rudloe Manor in Wiltshire. Only three of the 12 squadron Hurricanes were operational. 238 shared Middle Wallop with 152, 604 and 609 Squadrons. 152 could field five of the 10 Supermarine Spitfires available, 604 had five from 11 Bristol Blenheims serviceable while 609 listed six of its 10 Spitfires combat ready. On 8 August a series of naval and air actions occurred around convoy Peewit. In the late morning StG 2, StG 3 and StG 77 from Angers, Caen and St. Malo set out with their V./LG 1 escort, to attack the convoy south of the Isle of Wight, with approximately 30 Bf 109s from II. and III./JG 27 for high cover. From 12:20, Spitfires of 609 Squadron and Hurricanes from 257 and 145 squadrons attacked the German formations, joined later by 238 Squadron. The Ju 87s severely damaged SS Surte, MV Scheldt and SS Omlandia and sank SS Balmaha soon after. SS Tres was sunk by StG 77\\\\. SS Empire Crusader, in the lead, was hit by StG 2 and sank several hours later; four ships were sunk and four were damaged in the attacks. From 20 to 30 RAF fighters attacked the German aircraft and I. and II./StG 2 suffered one damaged Ju 87 each, StG 3 lost three Stukas from I. Gruppe and two damaged. LG 1 lost one Bf 110 and three damaged, JG 27 lost three Bf 109s and two damaged, the three lost pilots coming from II. Gruppe. Three Hurricanes from 238 Squadron were shot down and two pilots were killed by Bf 109s. Squadron Leader H. A. Fenton was wounded while shooting down a He 59 floatplane and rescued by the trawler HMS Basset. Hurricane I, the type flown by 238 in 1940 82 Ju 87s from III./StG 1, I./StG 3 and Stab, II./StG 77 were prepared for another operation. Major Walter Sigel led StG 3 to rendezvous with escorts from Bf 110s from II./Zerst√∂rergeschwader 2 (ZG 2, Destroyer Wing 2), LG 1 and Bf 109s from II./JG 27\\\\. III./JG 26, II. and III./JG 51 flew a fighter sweep to clear the skies before the attack and engaged Nos. 41, 64 and 65 Squadrons. The ships of Peewit had sailed on and the anti-submarine yachts HMS Wilna, HMS Rion, trawlers HMS Cape Palliser, Kingston Chrysoberyl, Kingston Olivine and Stella Capella were attacked, having been sent to rescue survivors. Cape Palliser and Rion were badly damaged. 152 and 238 squadrons tried to intercept but failed to make contact with the attackers but 152 Squadron met Bf 109s from JG 53 south of Swanage and two Spitfires were damaged and force-landed, the pilots unhurt. II./JG 53 claimed two Spitfires and a Hurricane for no loss. II./JG 53 commanded by G√ºnther Freiherr von Maltzahn flew from Guernsey. On 11 August the final round of convoy attacks began on Convoys Booty, Agent and Arena. Keith Park, Air Officer Commanding, No. 11 Group RAF identified the convoys and naval base at Isle of Portland as the Germans' main objective for the day. Radar detected a large build-up over the Cherbourg peninsula. He ordered 609 and 1 Squadron up from Warmwell and RAF Tangmere. Six other units from Middle Wallop and Exeter, Tangmere and Warmwell were ordered to readiness. Some 53 fighters were now involved. The German formation approached in strength in the late morning. Around 54 Ju 88s from I., and II./KG 54 were supported by 20 Heinkel He 111s from KG 27. I., and II./ZG 2 provided 61 Bf 110s as escort which were reinforced by 30 Bf 109s from III./JG 2 under the command of Erich Mix. JG 27 provided withdrawal cover. It was the largest raid yet sent against a British target. Within a minute from 10:04, 145, 152, 87, 213 and 238 Squadrons were scrambled to support the two airborne Squadrons. JG 27 were involved in combat as they covered the raid's withdrawal. JG 27 lost three of its number to 238 and 145 squadrons but the German fighters destroyed three 238 Hurricanes, killing two pilots. 145 suffered two damaged and two destroyed and two pilots killed. The massive dogfight resulted in the loss of 16 Hurricanes with 13 pilots killed and two wounded. A 152 Squadron Spitfire was lost and its pilot drowned. German losses amounted to six Bf 110s, five Ju 88s, one He 111 and six Bf 109s. The number of aircraft lost over the Channel prompted both sides to send forces out to locate survivors. Squadron Leader H A Fenton was wounded after being shot down by a He 59 float plane he was attacking and rescued. The two dead pilots were Flight Lieutenant D E Turner and Flying Officer D C McCaw. Adlerangriff On 13 August, the main German offensive \\"Adlertag\\" began against Fighter Command airfields. Unaware of the German intent, the controllers directed three full Squadrons and detachments of three others were alerted by 06:15. 238 was moved to cover their own base at RAF Warmwell. A mistake by the Observer Corps allowed KG 2 to slip through the net, but their bombing raid against RAF Hornchurch achieved little. I./KG 54 struck at the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) base at Gosport. ZG 2 was supposed to provide escort during one these attacks, and in a breakdown of communications, arrived over the target without their Ju 88s, which had been ordered to stand down. One ZG 2 Bf 110 was recorded destroyed and two more damaged. 238 pilots claimed one He 111, one Do 17, five Bf 109s destroyed, and one probably destroyed, five Bf 110s destroyed, two probably destroyed and four damaged. In an afternoon development, I./LG 1 abandoned an attack on Boscombe Down and bombed Southampton instead. 238 Squadron had been detailed to intercept, but the fighter escort was too strong and the bombers were not diverted from their course. Several warehouses were destroyed and a cold storage plant was also knocked out. All fires were under control by dusk. Luftwaffe intelligence had not identified the Southampton Spitfire factory‚Äîon the waterfront near the docks‚Äîas an important target. Poor intelligence suggested it was a bomber factory. Only later, in September, was it attacked and severely damaged. However, even then the Germans were unaware of the damage inflicted to Spitfire production. The factory would later be broken up and production dispersed. Hurricanes using the Vic formation, 1940 238 Squadron lost three Hurricanes with another damaged in combat with Bf 109s on 13 August. Sergeant L G Batt survived, Sergeant E W Seaborne was rescued by a destroyed with severe burns. Sergeant H J Marsh was killed and Sergeant R Little was unhurt. 238 moved to St Eval in Cornwall on 14 August. Scarcely six weeks old, and a veteran unit already, the squadron was moved to rest in the quieter South West England. The squadron was considered among those \\"hard-pressed\\" units and was removed from the frontline personally by Hugh Dowding. Squadron Leader Fenton commented on the cosmopolitan makeup of the Squadron; \\"The Poles and Czechs were vital as it turned out. It was amazing how quickly we became real friends. I flew with a Pole on one side and a Czech on the other and was delighted to be so well looked after.\\" The only action of note of the month came on 21 August when a single Ju 88 dropped six bombs on the airfield, destroying one hangar. 238 scrambled and gave chase but did not catch the intruder. In the afternoon three Ju 88s of Kampfgruppe 806 [coastal reconnaissance group] were intercepted; two were shot down. Maps and charts washed ashore from the wrecks indicated the targets were Newquay and Penzance. Leutnant zur See von Davidson and Mieher were lost with their crews [Luftwaffe coastal airmen sometimes carried Kriegsmarine ranks]. Bob Doe, during World War II On 1 September 1940, 238 were based at St Eval with a strength of 11 Hurricanes and only four operational. 236 Squadron was the only other unit to occupy the airfield. Squadron Leader Fenton still commanded the squadron according to the order of battle, though he was absent after wounds sustained in August. The squadron was being commanded by Flight Lieutenant Minden Blake, who had taken over the previous month. On 11 September the squadron lost three Hurricanes in combat over Greater London; one pilot, Flight Lieutenant David Price Hughes, a fighter ace with five victories, was killed and another wounded in battle with Ju 88s over Tunbridge Wells. On 15 September 1940 238 Squadron fought in the large air battles termed the \\"Battle of Britain Day\\". No. 11 Group RAF and No. 12 Group RAF were committed in other areas forcing Park to request 238 to Middle Wallop. The squadron was ordered to cover RAF Kenley. The squadron had all but one of the 18 Hurricanes assigned to it available for combat. 238 Squadron formed the defence against the large air raids at noon. With support from 602 and 609, the squadron went in first against Kampfgeschwader 53 Heinkel He 111s and their escorts. The other two squadrons attacked Kampfgeschwader 2 Do 17s. Six KG 53 bombers were destroyed and two damaged, though 1, 66, 229, 242 and 504 and 92 squadrons inflicted losses on the unit. Fighter Command reported one loss for the squadron plus three more damaged. Sergeant L Pidd was killed after he baled out in combat with Bf 110s but his parachute did not deploy. Recent sources state Pidd baled out too low when he hit a tree at low-level during a dogfight‚Äîhe was the only 238 casualty on 15 September. 238 patrolled over Middle Wallop in the evening but no known interception took place. 238 claimed four He 111s destroyed, one probably destroyed and two damaged along with two Bf 110s destroyed and an unidentified type damaged. The squadron achieved a victory over a Ju 88 from 1./LG 1 on 21 September which crashed and killed the crew. On 25 September 238 intercepted Kampfgeschwader 55 over Dorset. They targeted the Westland aircraft factory at Yeovil with 100 tons of bombs and 24 incendiaries. Supported by 152 Squadron they destroyed five bombers and another damaged. Sergeant F A Silbey baled out was reported shot down by Bf 110s; Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 was known to be operating in the area and reported two losses and two damaged on 25 September. The following day KG 55 struck at the Woolston factory covered by 70 Bf 110s. 229, 238 and 303 Squadrons intercepted. Three 238 Hurricanes were lost with one pilot killed; Sergeant V Horsky. Squadron Leader Fenton was reported shot down by unidentified Bf 109s but survived. R A King, the third pilot survived apparently unhurt. I and I Gruppe ZG 26 reported one Bf 110 each shot down with the loss of their crews in combat with 238. Only a single 2./KG 55 was shot down because of strong protection from ZG 26. Despite the interception, 59 Heinkels dropped 70 tons of bombs on the factory bringing production to a halt. Three complete Spitfires, were destroyed, 20 damaged and 37 people were killed in the factory and 52 in surrounding areas. 238 pilots claimed four Bf 110s destroyed and five damaged. Three He 111s were claimed destroyed. On 27 September Pilot Officer Bob Doe joined 238 Squadron. Four days later he shot down a ZG 26 Bf 110 but 238 lost two Hurricanes and Sergeant F A Sibley killed. Sergeants R Little and S E Bann along with Pilot Officer D Harrison were killed in combat with Bf 109s on 28 September. Fighter Command performed poorly on the day, claiming four for the loss of 11 Hurricanes four Spitfires and nine pilots killed. German tactics had changed to using faster Bf 110s as fighter-bombers and Ju 88s, in few numbers while providing strong Bf 109 escorting forces. Over 200 German fighters flew into action. On 30 September 238 was operating again, losing two Hurricanes in a collision, wounding one of the pilots. Doe and another pilot accounted for a I and II/KG 55 destroyed south of Portland. German raids over the southwest persisted and on 7 October 238 intercepted 25 Ju 88s from KG 51 with escort from I, II and III/ZG 26. Five other squadrons were involved in the battle, but 238 accounted for one of the two Ju 88s shot down; Doe receiving credit. At least one of the seven Bf 110s lost by ZG 26 were credited to 238. Bf 109s intervened to cover the German withdrawal and Pilot Officer A R Covington was shot down and wounded. Three days later, Doe was wounded in combat with an unidentified Bf 109 unit. The Battle of Britain officially ended on 31 October 1940. Fighter Command still had to deal with hit-and-run tactics by the Luftwaffe. Bf 109s equipped with bombs carried out these operations alongside fighter sweeps over southern England. On 5 November 1940 Sergeant J Jeka and Pilot Officer B B Considine became victims of such operations, shot down by Bf 109s near Bournemouth, though both men survived. 238 were on patrol when attacked by Bf 109s probably belonging to JG 2 and led by Helmut Wick, one of the leading German fighter pilots and at the time of his death, the most successful of the war. The following day, 238 experienced its last fatality of the year, when Pilot Officer J Tillett, 238 Squadron was killed in action with JG 2. In January 1941, 238 were operating from Chilbolton under the command of 10 Group. =Malta and North Africa= Hurricane IIs, North Africa. 238 Squadron operated the type into 1942 In May 1941 the squadron left for the Middle East its aircraft being flown off HMS Victorious to Malta while the ground echelon sailed round the Cape of Good Hope. 28 Hurricanes of 238 flew to the island and as soon as refuelling had been complete flew seven hours to eastern Egypt. After refuelling in Malta the Hurricanes flew on to the Western Desert where they were attached to No. 274 Squadron on 15 June 1941, pending the arrival of the squadron's own ground crews. 238 operated from LG 109 alongside 1 Squadron SAAF from 20 October 1941. They escorted six Blenheims from 113 and No. 55 Squadron RAF to Gambut. II/JG 27 intercepted and shot down two Blenheims, two 238 Squadron pilots and one 1 SAAF pilot. Sergeants Savy baled out and Knappett crash-landed, though he returned to the unit later. The South African pilot was captured. Another Hurricane was lost in action with this unit on 30 October. From 17 November 1941, 238 was assigned to 258 Wing for the upcoming Operation Crusader. By the end of July, No. 238 was again operating as a complete unit, flying escort missions and fighter patrols throughout the campaign in the desert until after the Battle of El Alamein. Even so, some Beaufighters belonging to the squadron were based at RAF Pembrey temporarily during 1943. The squadron was then withdrawn to Egypt for air defence duties and converted to Spitfires in September 1943. In March 1944, the squadron moved to Corsica for sweeps over Northern Italy and in August covered the Allied landings in Southern France. After moving there for two months, it was withdrawn to Naples and disbanded on 26 October 1944. =Asia and the Pacific= On 1 December 1944, No. 238 reformed at RAF Merryfield as a transport squadron and was originally intended to fly Albemaries. In January 1945 it received Dakotas and on 14 February its first wave of ten aircraft left for India where they began supply-dropping and casualty evacuation missions over Burma. In June the squadron moved to Australia to provide transport support for the British Pacific Fleet as part of No. 300 Group, officially disbanding there on 27 December 1945. Disbandment, Cold War, current use Its remaining aircraft left for Singapore on 9 February 1946, others having been flown back to the UK during January. On 1 December 1946, No.525 Squadron at Abingdon was renumbered 238 Squadron and flew Dakotas until renumbered 10 Squadron on 4 October 1948, during the Berlin airlift. In 2007 Line Training Flight (LTF) at RAF Cosford were permitted to use the squadron numberplate as a non-flying unit. The role undertaken is that of LTF and mechanical maintenance. Jaguars were formerly used on the taxiways at the RAF Cosford airfield site to train students in marshaling aircraft, this leaves only the Synthetic Environment Procedural Trainer (SEPT) to train marshalling and airfield situational awareness. The SEPT was initially designed in the early 2000s to supplement training on live running aircraft. Despite the loss of live running aircraft, the squadron remains extant.

This doctrine was defined dogmatically at the First Vatican Council of 1869‚Äì1870 in the document Pastor aeternus, but had been defended before that, existing already in medieval theology and being the majority opinion at the time of the Counter-Reformation. The infallible teachings of the Pope are part of the Church's magisterium, which also consists of ecumenical councils and the \\"ordinary and universal magisterium\\". In Catholic theology, papal infallibility is one of the channels of the infallibility of the Church. The doctrine of infallibility relies on one of the cornerstones of Catholic dogma: that of papal supremacy, and his authority as the ruling agent who decides what are accepted as formal beliefs in the Roman Catholic Church.Erwin Fahlbusch et al. The encyclopedia of Christianity Eradman Books The use of this power is referred to as speaking ex cathedra.Wilhelm, Joseph and Thomas Scannell. Manual of Catholic Theology. Volume 1, Part 1. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & Co. Ltd. 1906. pp. 94‚Äì100 The solemn declaration of papal infallibility by Vatican I took place on 18 July 1870. Since that time, the only example of an ex cathedra decree took place in 1950, when Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as an article of faith.Encyclopedia of Catholicism by Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton 207 p. 267 Prior to the solemn definition of 1870, the only agreed upon infallible definition of a pope apart from a council was that of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in Ineffabilis Deus of 1854.\\"We declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful.\\"MacArthur, John F., Jr. Charismatic Chaos. Grand Rapids: Zondervan. 1992. p. 90 In both cases the pope checked with bishops worldwide that this was the belief of the Church before proceeding to a formal definition.  Doctrine  1881 illustration depicting papal infallibility = Nature of infallibility = The church teaches that infallibility is a charism entrusted by Christ to the whole church, whereby the Pope, as \\"head of the college of bishops,\\" enjoys papal infallibility. This charism is the supreme degree of participating in Christ's divine authority, which, in the New Covenant, so as to safeguard the faithful from defection and guarantee the profession of faith, ensures the faithful abide in the truth. The church further teaches that divine assistance is also given to the Pope when he exercises his ordinary Magisterium. = Conditions for teachings being declared infallible = According to the teaching of the First Vatican Council and Catholic tradition, the conditions required for ex cathedra papal teaching are as follows: # the Roman Pontiff (the Pope alone or with the College of Bishops) # speaks ex cathedra, that is, when, (in the discharge of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, and by virtue of his supreme apostolic authority,) he defines a doctrine ## concerning faith or morals ## to be held by the whole Church. The terminology of a definitive decree usually makes clear that this last condition is fulfilled, as through a formula such as \\"By the authority of Our Lord Jesus Christ and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by Our own authority, We declare, pronounce and define the doctrine . . . to be revealed by God and as such to be firmly and immutably held by all the faithful,\\" or through an accompanying anathema stating that anyone who deliberately dissents is outside the Catholic Church.Harty, John. \\"Theological Definition.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 9 January 2019 For example, in 1950, with Munificentissimus Deus, Pope Pius XII's infallible definition regarding the Assumption of Mary, there are attached these words: \\"Hence if anyone, which God forbid, should dare willfully to deny or to call into doubt that which We have defined, let him know that he has fallen away completely from the divine and Catholic Faith.\\" As with all charisms, the church teaches that the charism of papal infallibility must be properly discerned, though only by the Church's leaders.Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's Letter ‚ÄúIuvenescit Ecclesia‚Äù, 9 Finally, conciliar teaching constantly recognizes the essential role of pastors in the discernment of the charisms and their ordered exercise within the ecclesial communion.[27]...Footnote [27] Cf. Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium, 12: \\"judgment as to their genuinity and proper use belongs to those who are appointed leaders in the Church, to whose special competence it belongs, not indeed to extinguish the Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to that which is good (cf. 1 Ts 5:12 and 19-21)‚Äù. Although this refers immediately to the discernment of extraordinary gifts, by analogy, what is stated here applies generically for every charism. The way to know if something a pope says is infallible or not is to discern if they are ex cathedra teachings. Also considered infallible are the teachings of the whole body of bishops of the Church, especially but not only in an ecumenical council (see Infallibility of the Church). = Limits = Pastor aeternus does not allow any infallibility for the Church or Pope for new doctrines. Any doctrines defined must be \\"conformable with Sacred Scripture and Apostolic Traditions\\": > For the Holy Spirit was not promised to the successors of Peter that by His > revelation they might make known new doctrine, but that by His assistance > they might inviolably keep and faithfully expound the Revelation, the > Deposit of Faith, delivered through the Apostles. It gives examples of the kinds of consultations that are appropriate include assembling Ecumenical Councils, asking for the mind of the church scattered around the world, Synods, and so on. Not all Catholic teaching is infallible. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith differentiates three kinds of doctrine: * to be believed as divinely revealed * to be held definitely ** following a solemn defining act by a Pope or Ecumenical council ** following a non-defining act by a Pope, confirming or re-affirming a thing taught by the ordinary and universal teaching authority of bishops worldwide * otherwise, to be respected or submitted to (in the case of priests and religious) as part of the ordinary teaching authority of bishops, but without any claim of infallibility. Examples of doctrines to be believed as divinely revealed include the sayings of Jesus in the Gospels, since the Gospels are part of the Bible, which is part of the deposit of divine revelation. Examples of doctrines to be held definitely include the Immaculate Conception of Mary, the Assumption of Mary, Transubstantiation, the Sacramental Seal, women not being allowed to be ordained as priests, and papal infallibility itself. In July 2005 Pope Benedict XVI stated during an impromptu address to priests in Aosta that: \\"The Pope is not an oracle; he is infallible in very rare situations, as we know.\\"\\"Pope Has No Easy \\"Recipe\\" for Church Crisis.\\" Zenit, 29 July 2005, retrieved 8 July 2009, zenit.org Pope John XXIII once remarked: \\"I am only infallible if I speak infallibly but I shall never do that, so I am not infallible.\\" A doctrine proposed by a pope as his own opinion, not solemnly proclaimed as a doctrine of the Church, may be rejected as false, even if it is on a matter of faith and morals, and even more any view he expresses on other matters. A well-known example of a personal opinion on a matter of faith and morals that was taught by a pope but rejected by the Church is the view that Pope John XXII expressed on when the dead can reach the beatific vision. The limitation on the pope's infallibility \\"on other matters\\" is frequently illustrated by Cardinal James Gibbons's recounting how the pope mistakenly called him Jibbons.  Background  Ex cathedra = Marian Dogma of Assumption in 1950. Painting of the Assumption, Rubens, 1626 Cathedra and sedes are Latin words for a chair, the symbol of the teacher in the ancient world; the \\"chair\\" is still used metaphorically as the office of a university professor, and to the \\"see\\" of a bishop (from sedes). The pope is said to occupy the \\"chair of Peter\\" or the \\"Holy See\\", since Catholics hold that the pope is the successor of Peter. Also, Catholics hold that Peter had a special role among the apostles as the preserver of unity, and that the pope therefore holds the role of spokesman for the whole church among the bishops, whom Catholics hold to be the successors of the apostles. The doctrine of papal infallibility, the Latin phrase ex cathedra (literally, \\"from the chair\\"), was proclaimed by Pius IX in 1870 as meaning \\"when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, [the Bishop of Rome] defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church.\\" The response demanded from believers has been characterized as \\"assent\\" in the case of ex cathedra declarations of the popes and \\"due respect\\" with regard to their other declarations. = Scripture and primacy of Peter = On the basis of , , and , the Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Peter as holding first place among the apostles. It speaks of Peter as the rock on which, because of Peter's faith, Christ said in he would build his Church, which he declared would be victorious over the powers of death. In , Jesus gave Peter the mission to keep his faith after every lapse and to strengthen his brothers in it. The Catechism of the Catholic Church sees the power of the keys that Jesus promised to Peter alone in as signifying authority to govern the house of God, that is, the Church, an authority that Jesus after his resurrection confirmed for Peter by instructing him in to feed Christ's sheep. The power to bind and loose, conferred on all the apostles jointly and to Peter in particular (Matthew 16:19), is seen in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as authority to absolve sins, to pronounce judgments on doctrine and to make decisions on Church discipline. = Historical support for the Primacy of the Roman pontiff = Supporters of the pope outside the United Nations in 2008 with a banner quoting Matthew 16 Pope St. Clement of Rome, c. 99, stated in a letter to the Corinthians: \\"Indeed you will give joy and gladness to us, if having become obedient to what we have written through the Holy Spirit, you will cut out the unlawful application of your zeal according to the exhortation which we have made in this epistle concerning peace and union\\" (Denziger ¬ß41, emphasis added). St. Clement of Alexandria wrote on the primacy of Peter c. 200: \\"the blessed Peter, the chosen, the pre- eminent, the first among the disciples, for whom alone with Himself the Savior paid the tribute\\" (Jurgens ¬ß436). The existence of an ecclesiastical hierarchy is emphasized by St. Stephan I, 251, in a letter to the bishop of Antioch: \\"Therefore did not that famous defender of the Gospel [Novatian] know that there ought to be one bishop in the Catholic Church [of the city of Rome]? It did not lie hidden from him\\" (Denziger ¬ß45). St. Julius I, in 341 wrote to the Antiochenes: \\"Or do you not know that it is the custom to write to us first, and that here what is just is decided?\\" (Denziger ¬ß57a, emphasis added). Catholicism holds that an understanding among the apostles was written down in what became the scriptures, and rapidly became the living custom of the Church, and that from there a clearer theology could unfold. St. Siricius wrote to Himerius in 385: \\"To your inquiry we do not deny a legal reply, because we, upon whom greater zeal for the Christian religion is incumbent than upon the whole body, out of consideration for our office do not have the liberty to dissimulate, nor to remain silent. We carry the weight of all who are burdened; nay rather the blessed apostle PETER bears these in us, who, as we trust, protects us in all matters of his administration, and guards his heirs\\" (Denziger ¬ß87, emphasis in original). Many of the Church Fathers spoke of ecumenical councils and the Bishop of Rome as possessing a reliable authority to teach the content of scripture and tradition.  Theological history  Pope Leo XIII, as Bishop of Rome and successor of the Apostle Peter, represented as guiding the ship of God's Church (painting by Friedrich Stummel in Kevelaer Shrine 1903).Die katholischen Missionen, September 1903 Brian Tierney argued that the 13th-century Franciscan priest Peter Olivi was the first person to attribute infallibility to the pope. Tierney's idea was accepted by August Bernhard Hasler, and by Gregory Lee Jackson,Gregory Lee Jackson, Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant (Self-published 2007 ), p. 185 It was rejected by James Heft\\"Heft disagrees with Tierney's thesis that the roots of papal infallibility extend only to Olivi\\" (John V. Kruse, \\"Reevaluating The Origins of Papal Infallibility\\" (Saint Louis University 2005), p. 2) and by John V. Kruse.Kruse's conclusions on the basis of papal bulls of the time give uncertain results about the existence in them of the notion of papal infallibility (Abstract of John V. Kruse, \\"Reevaluating The Origins of Papal Infallibility\\" (Saint Louis University 2005) Klaus Schatz says Olivi by no means played the key role assigned to him by Tierney, who failed to acknowledge the work of earlier canonists and theologians, and that the crucial advance in the teaching came only in the 15th century, two centuries after Olivi; and he declares that, \\"It is impossible to fix a single author or era as the starting point.\\" Ulrich Horst criticized the Tierney view for the same reasons. In his Protestant evaluation of the ecumenical issue of papal infallibility, Mark E. Powell rejects Tierney's theory about 13th-century Olivi, saying that the doctrine of papal infallibility defined at Vatican I had its origins in the 14th century ‚Äì he refers in particular to Bishop Guido Terreni ‚Äì and was itself part of a long development of papal claims. Schatz points to \\"... the special esteem given to the Roman church community [that] was always associated with fidelity in the faith and preservation of the paradosis (the faith as handed down).\\" Schatz differentiates between the later doctrine of \\"infallibility of the papal magisterium\\" and the Hormisdas formula in 519, which asserted that, \\"The Roman church has never erred (and will never err).\\" He emphasizes that Hormisdas formula was not meant to apply so much to \\"... individual dogmatic definitions but to the whole of the faith as handed down and the tradition of Peter preserved intact by the Roman Church.\\" Specifically, Schatz argues that the Hormisdas formula does not exclude the possibility that individual popes become heretics because the formula refers \\"... primarily to the Roman tradition as such and not exclusively to the person of the pope.\\" = Ecumenical councils = The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani contained the declaration by Pope Gregory I (590‚Äì604) that the first four ecumenical councils were to be revered \\"... like the four gospels\\" because they had been \\"established by universal consent\\", and also Gratian's assertion that, \\"The holy Roman Church imparts authority to the sacred canons but is not bound by them.\\" Commentators on the Decretum, known as the Decretists, generally concluded that a pope could change the disciplinary decrees of the ecumenical councils but was bound by their pronouncements on articles of faith, in which field the authority of a general council was higher than that of an individual pope. Unlike those who propounded the 15th- century conciliarist theories, they understood an ecumenical council as necessarily involving the pope, and meant that the pope plus the other bishops was greater than a pope acting alone. = Middle Ages = Several medieval theologians discussed the infallibility of the pope when defining matters of faith and morals, including Thomas Aquinas. The Dictatus papae have been attributed to Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì1085) in the year 1075, but some have argued that they are later than 1087.Dictatus Papae 1090; cf. Miller, M. C., (2005), Power and the Holy in the Age of the Investiture Conflict: A Brief History with Documents, (Bedford; New York), pp. 81‚Äì83. They assert that no one can judge the pope (Proposition 19) and that \\"the Roman church has never erred; nor will it err to all eternity, the Scripture bearing witness\\" (Proposition 22). This is seen as a further step in advancing the idea that \\"... had been part of church history and debate as far back as 519 when the notion of the Bishop of Rome as the preserver of apostolic truth was set forth in the Formula of Hormisdas.\\" In the early years of the 14th century, the Franciscan Order found itself in open conflict between the \\"Spirituals\\" and the Conventual Franciscans over the form of poverty to observe.Brooke, The Image of St Francis, p. 100 The Spirituals adopted extremist positions that eventually discredited the notion of apostolic poverty and led to condemnation by Pope John XXII.Philip D. Krey et al., Nicholas of Lyra: The Senses of Scripture (Brill 2000 ), p. 240. This pope determined to suppress what he considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, either separately or jointly. The \\"Spirituals\\" argued that John XXII's predecessors had declared the absolute poverty of Christ to be an article of faith and that therefore no pope could declare the contrary. Appeal was made in particular to the 14 August 1279 bull Exiit qui seminat, in which Pope Nicholas III stated that renunciation of ownership of all things \\"... both individually but also in common, for God's sake, is meritorious and holy; Christ, also, showing the way of perfection, taught it by word and confirmed it by example, and the first founders of the Church militant, as they had drawn it from the fountainhead itself, distributed it through the channels of their teaching and life to those wishing to live perfectly.\\"Brooke, Rosalind B. The Image of St Francis (Cambridge University Press 2006 ), p. 98 By the bull Ad conditorem canonum of 8 December 1322, John XXII, declaring it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, forced them to accept ownership by ending the arrangement according to which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere use of it. He thus demolished the fictitious structure that gave the appearance of absolute poverty to the life of the Franciscan friars,Brooke, pp. 100‚Äì01 a structure that \\"... absolved the Franciscans from the moral burden of legal ownership, and enabled them to practise apostolic poverty without the inconvenience of actual poverty.\\" This document was concerned with disciplinary rather than doctrinal matters, but leaders of the Franciscans reacted with insistence on the irreformability of doctrinal papal decrees, with special reference to Exiit. A year later, John XXII issued the short 12 November 1323 bull Cum inter nonnullos, which declared \\"erroneous and heretical\\" the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatever. The next year, the Pope responded to continued criticisms with the bull Quia quorundam of 10 November 1324. He denied the major premise of an argument of his adversaries, \\"What the Roman pontiffs have once defined in faith and morals with the key of knowledge stands so immutably that it is not permitted to a successor to revoke it.\\" He declared that there was no contradiction between his own statements and those of his predecessors; that it could not be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing: \\"indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living 'without property' does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common\\"; that there were many things in the Franciscan rule \\"... which Christ neither taught nor confirmed by his example,\\" and that there was neither merit nor truth in pretending Christ and the apostles had no rights in law. In his book on the First Vatican Council, August Hasler wrote, \\"John XXII didn't want to hear about his own infallibility. He viewed it as an improper restriction of his rights as a sovereign, and in the bull Qui quorundam (1324) condemned the Franciscan doctrine of papal infallibility as the work of the devil.\\"Hasler, A. B., (1981) How the Pope Became Infallible: Pius IX and the Politics of Persuasion (Doubleday; Garden City, NY), pp. 36‚Äì37 Brian Tierney has summed up his view of the part played by John XXII as follows: In 1330, the Carmelite bishop Guido Terreni described the pope's charism of infallibility in terms very similar to those that the First Vatican Council was to use in 1870. In 1596, in The Catholic Controversy, Francis de Sales wrote: > [E]verything a king says is not a law or an edict, but that only which a > king says as king and as a legislator. So everything the Pope says is not > canon law or of legal obligation; he must mean to define and to lay down the > law for the sheep, and he must keep the due order and form. ...We must not > think that in everything and everywhere his judgment is infallible, but then > only when he gives judgment on a matter of faith in questions necessary to > the whole Church; for in particular cases which depend on human fact he can > err, there is no doubt. ...Theologians have said, ... in a word, that he can > err extra cathedram, outside the chair of Peter, that is, as a private > individual, by writings and bad example. But he cannot err when he is in > cathedra, that is, when he intends to make an instruction and decree for the > guidance of the whole Church, when he means to confirm his brethren as > supreme pastor, and to conduct them into the pastures of the faith. For then > it is not so much man who determines, resolves, and defines as it is the > Blessed Holy Spirit by man, which Spirit, according to the promise made by > Our Lord to the Apostles, teaches all truth to the Church.De Sales, Francis. > The Catholic Controversy, (Henry B. Mackey, tr.) Rockford, Illinois: TAN > Books, 1989, pp. 306-307 = Post-Counter-Reformation = In the period following the Counter- Reformation the Dominican school of theology at the Roman College of Saint Thomas in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum was active in defending the doctrine of papal infallibility. Vincentius Ferre (+1682), Regent of College of St. Thomas from 1654 to 1672,Remigius Coulon, Ferre: Vincent, in: Dictionary of Catholic Theology, ed. by A. Vacant, E. Mangenor and E. Amann, Vol 5/2, Paris 1913, 2176‚Äì77. writes in his De Fide in defense of papal Infallibility that Christ said \\"I have prayed for thee, Peter; sufficiently showing that the infallibility was not promised to the Church as apart from (seorsum) the head, but promised to the head, that from him it should be derived to the Church.\\" Dominic Gravina, professor of theology at the College of St. Thomas in Rome wrote concerning papal infallibility: \\"To the Pontiff, as one (person) and alone, it was given to be the head,\\" and again, \\"The Roman Pontiff for the time being is one, therefore he alone has infallibility.\\" Vincenzo Maria Gatti, also a professor of theology at the College of St. Thomas, defending papal infallibility, says of Christ's words \\"I have prayed for thee,\\" etc., that \\"indefectibility is promised to Peter apart from (seorsum) the Church, or from the Apostles; but it is not promised to the Apostles, or to the Church. apart (seorsum) the head, or with the head,\\" adding: \\"Therefore Peter, even apart from (seorsum) the Church, is infallible.\\" = Pastor aeternus: Dogmatic definition of 1870 = Painting to commemorate the dogma of papal infallibility (Voorschoten, 1870). Right to left: Pope Pius IX, Christ and Thomas Aquinas The infallibility of the pope was formally defined in 1870, although the tradition behind this view goes back much further. In the conclusion of the fourth chapter of its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Pastor aeternus, the First Vatican Council declared the following, with bishops Aloisio Riccio and Edward Fitzgerald dissenting: According to Catholic theology, this is an infallible dogmatic definition by an ecumenical council. Because the 1870 definition is not seen by Catholics as a creation of the Church, but as the dogmatic revelation of a truth about the papal magisterium, papal teachings made prior to the 1870 proclamation can, if they meet the criteria set out in the dogmatic definition, be considered infallible. Ineffabilis Deus is the only generally accepted example of this. = Lumen gentium = The dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, which was also a document on the Church itself, explicitly reaffirmed the definition of papal infallibility, so as to avoid any doubts, expressing this in the following words:  Operation  Frequency of infallible declarations = There is debate in the Church between those who believe that infallibility is exercised rarely and explicitly and those that believe that it is common. However, the Catholic Church does not teach that the pope is infallible in everything he says; official invocation of papal infallibility is extremely rare. The encyclical of Humani generis of Pope Pius XII states that (unless explicitly stated) papal encyclicals are not infallible documents but are teachings that Catholic theologians must follow: \\"Nor must it be thought that what is expounded in Encyclical Letters does not of itself demand consent, since in writing such Letters the Popes do not exercise the supreme power of their Teaching Authority. For these matters are taught with the ordinary teaching authority.\\" An example of where there is dispute over whether a subject matter is within the limits of infallibility is the canonization of a saint by a pope. If they are, then they would represent a very common occurrence during a papacy. However, those are usually regarded as not of divine faith, as they depend on facts that post-date New Testament revelation. The status of individuals as saints in heaven is not taught in the Catholic Catechism or Creeds as required for belief. However, some Catholic theologians have in the past held that the canonization of a saint by a pope is infallible teaching that the person canonized is definitely in heaven with God, because it relates to Faith. A decree of canonization invites the whole Church to venerate the person as a saint, while beatification merely permits it. = Instances of infallible declarations = Catholic theologians agree that both Pope Pius IX's 1854 definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary and Pope Pius XII's 1950 definition of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary are instances of papal infallibility. Both followed wide consultation with the bishops, as to whether these doctrines were already believed worldwide. However, theologians disagree about what other documents qualify. Regarding historical papal documents, Catholic theologian and church historian Klaus Schatz made a thorough study, published in 1985, that identified the following list of ex cathedra documents (see Creative Fidelity: Weighing and Interpreting Documents of the Magisterium, by Francis A. Sullivan, chapter 6): # Tome to Flavian, Pope Leo I, 449, on the two natures in Christ, received by the Council of Chalcedon; # Letter of Pope Agatho, 680, on the two wills of Christ, received by the Third Council of Constantinople; # Benedictus Deus, Pope Benedict XII, 1336, on the beatific vision of the just after death rather than only just prior to final judgment; # Cum occasione, Pope Innocent X, 1653, condemning five propositions of Jansen as heretical; # Auctorem fidei, Pope Pius VI, 1794, condemning several Jansenist propositions of the Synod of Pistoia as heretical; # Ineffabilis Deus, Pope Pius IX, 1854, defining the Immaculate Conception; # Munificentissimus Deus, Pope Pius XII, 1950, defining the Assumption of Mary. There is no complete list of papal statements considered infallible. A 1998 commentary on Ad Tuendam Fidem issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published on L'Osservatore Romano in July 1998 listed a number of instances of infallible pronouncements by popes and by ecumenical councils, but explicitly stated (at no. 11) that this was not meant to be a complete list. One of the documents mentioned is Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis on reserving priestly ordination to men alone, which the Congregation earlier stated to be infallible, although not taught ex cathedra (i.e., although not a teaching of the extraordinary magisterium), clarifying that the content of this letter has been taught infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium. This was confirmed in a commentary by the same Congregation and in commentaries by Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger and Tarcisio Bertone. Many eminent theologians dispute that this is truly infallible, including Nicholas Lash, an ex-priest and Emeritus Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge.Letter to The Tablet, 16 June 2012 The Catholic Theological Society of America in a report, \\"Tradition and the Ordination of Women\\", concluded that Ordinatio sacerdotalis is mistaken with regard to its claims on the authority of this teaching and its grounds in Tradition. As well as popes, ecumenical councils have made pronouncements that the Church considers infallible.  Objections  Objections by Catholics = Before 1870, belief in papal infallibility was not a defined requirement of Catholic faith, though common in many times and areas with various meanings. Furthermore, it should not be assumed that what people were asserting or denying as papal infallibility corresponds to the modern doctrine, with its particular limits (\\"no new doctrine\\") and application (ex cathedra, faith and morals, etc.). In the French context of Jansenism, one infallibility debate was to deny that the pope was infallible on facts rather than just rights (doctrine). In the Irish/British context, declarations denying papal infallibility concern the pope's authority to overthrow states or commit religious genocide or require treason.  Prior to Vatican I  Examples of Catholics who before the First Vatican Council disbelieved in papal infallibility are French abb√© Fran√ßois-Philippe Mesenguy (1677‚Äì1763), who wrote a catechism denying the infallibility of the pope, and the German Felix Blau (1754‚Äì1798), who as professor at the University of Mainz criticized infallibility without a clearer mandate in Scripture.Lehner and Printy, Companion 2010, p. 151 In the Declaration and Protestation signed by the English Catholic Dissenters in 1789, the year of the French Revolution,Included in the signatories state: Under British/Irish King George III, a Catholic who wished to take office had to swear an oath of allegiance. The oath was particularly aimed at foreswearing that the Pope could infallibly order or forgive regicide. The oath was required in Ireland from 1793. A similar article was operative in England. Part of the oath stated \\"It is not an article of the Catholic Faith, neither am I thereby required to believe or profess that the Pope is infallible.\\" The Irish bishops repeated their acceptance in a 25 January 1826 pastoral address to the Catholic clergy and laity in Ireland, stating: \\"The Catholics of Ireland not only do not believe, but they declare upon oath ... that it is not an article of the Catholic faith, neither are they required to believe, that the Pope is infallible, and that they do not hold themselves 'bound to obey any order in its own nature immoral', though the Pope or any ecclesiastical power should issue or direct such an order; but, on the contrary, that it would be sinful in them to pay any respect or obedience thereto.\\"Gladstone, Vatican Decrees, vol. xliii, ed. 1875, quoted in Sparrow Simpson, pp. 101‚Äì02 In 1822, Bishop Baine declared: \\"In England and Ireland I do not believe that any Catholic maintains the Infallibility of the Pope.\\" In his 1829 study On the Church, Delahogue stated: \\"Ultramontane theologians attribute infallibility to the Bishop of Rome considered in this aspect and when he speaks, as the saying is, ex cathedra. This is denied by others, in particular by Gallicans.\\"\\"Romano pontifici sub hoc ultimo respectu considerato, et ubi loquitur, ut dicunt, ex cathedra, infallibilitatem attribuunt Ultramontani theologi, quibus alii, et Galli speciatim, contradicunt\\" G. Finch, The Romish Controversy (British Society for Promoting the Religious Principles of the Reformation, London 1850), vol. II, p. 846 Professor Delahogue asserted that the doctrine that the Roman Pontiff, even when he speaks ex cathedra, is possessed of the gift of inerrancy or is superior to General Councils may be denied without loss of faith or risk of heresy or schism. The 1830 edition of Berrington and Kirk's Faith of Catholics stated: \\"Papal definitions or decrees, in whatever form pronounced, taken exclusively from a General Council or acceptance of the Church, oblige no one under pain of heresy to an interior assent.\\" In 1861, Professor Murray of the major Irish Catholic seminary of Maynooth wrote that those who genuinely deny the infallibility of the pope \\"are by no means or only in the least degree (unless indeed some other ground be shown) to be considered alien from the Catholic Faith.\\"  Before and after Vatican I  Critical works such as Roman Catholic Opposition to Papal Infallibility (1909) by W. J. Sparrow Simpson have documented opposition to the definition of the dogma during the First Vatican Council even by those who believed in its teaching but felt that defining it was not opportune. Sparrow Simpson, an Anglican, notes that, \\"All works reprinted since 1870 have been altered into conformity with Vatican ideas\\". For example: * The 1860 edition of Keenan's Catechism in use in Catholic schools in England, Scotland and Wales attributed to Protestants the idea that Catholics were obliged to believe in papal infallibility: * In the 1895 revision:  After Vatican I  Following the 1869‚Äì1870 First Vatican Council, dissent arose among some Catholics, almost exclusively German, Austrian, and Swiss, over the definition of papal infallibility. The dissenters, while holding the General Councils of the Church infallible, were unwilling to accept the dogma of papal infallibility, and thus a schism arose between them and the Church, resulting in the formation of communities in schism with Rome, which became known as the Old Catholic Churches. The vast majority of Catholics accepted the definition. Before the First Vatican Council, John Henry Newman, while personally convinced, as a matter of theological opinion, of papal infallibility, opposed its definition as dogma, fearing that the definition might be expressed in over-broad terms open to misunderstanding. He was pleased with the moderate tone of the actual definition, which \\"affirmed the pope's infallibility only within a strictly limited province: the doctrine of faith and morals initially given to the apostolic Church and handed down in Scripture and tradition.\\"  Modern objections  A 1989‚Äì1992 survey of young people of the 15 to 25 age group (81% of whom were Catholics, 84% were younger than 19, and 62% were male) chiefly from the United States, but also from Austria, Canada, Ecuador, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Peru, Spain and Switzerland, found that 36.9% affirmed that, \\"The Pope has the authority to speak with infallibility,\\" 36.9% (exactly the same proportion) denied it, and 26.2% said they did not know. A few present-day Catholics, such as Hans K√ºng, author of Infallible? An Inquiry, and historian Garry Wills, author of Papal Sin, refuse to accept papal infallibility as a matter of faith. K√ºng has been sanctioned by the Church by being excluded from teaching Catholic theology. Brian Tierney agrees with K√ºng, whom he cites, and concludes: \\"There is no convincing evidence that papal infallibility formed any part of the theological or canonical tradition of the church before the thirteenth century; the doctrine was invented in the first place by a few dissident Franciscans because it suited their convenience to invent it; eventually, but only after much initial reluctance, it was accepted by the papacy because it suited the convenience of the popes to accept it.\\"Tierney, Origins of Papal Infallibility, 1150‚Äì1350 (Brill 1972), p. 281 Garth Hallett, \\"drawing on a previous study of Wittgenstein's treatment of word meaning,\\" argued that the dogma of infallibility is neither true nor false but meaningless; in practice, he claims, the dogma seems to have no practical use and to have succumbed to the sense that it is irrelevant.Darkness and Light: The Analysis of Doctrinal Statements (Paulist Press, 1975), and see Germain Grisez, \\"Note. Infallibility and Contraception: A Reply to Garth Hallett\\" in Theological Studies 47 (1986) In 1995, the Catholic feminist writer Margaret Hebblethwaite remarked:An historic decline in papal authority, Saturday 25 November 1995 01:02, The Independent, Margaret Hebblethwaite Catholic priest August Bernhard Hasler (d. 3 July 1980) wrote a detailed analysis of the First Vatican Council, presenting the passage of the infallibility definition as orchestrated. Roger O'Toole described Hasler's work as follows:Roger O'Toole, Review of \\"How the Pope Became Infallible: Pius IX and the Politics of Persuasion\\" by August Bernhard Hasler; Peter Heinegg, Sociological Analysis, Vol. 43, No. 1. (Spring, 1982), pp. 86‚Äì88, at p. 87. # It weakens or demolishes the claim that papal infallibility was already a universally accepted truth, and that its formal definition merely made de jure what had long been acknowledged de facto. # It emphasizes the extent of resistance to the definition, particularly in France and Germany. # It clarifies the \\"inopportunist\\" position as largely a polite fiction and notes how it was used by Infallibilists to trivialize the nature of the opposition to papal claims. # It indicates the extent to which \\"spontaneous popular demand\\" for the definition was, in fact, carefully orchestrated. # It underlines the personal involvement of the pope who, despite his coy disclaimers, appears as the prime mover and driving force behind the Infallibilist campaign. # It details the lengths to which the papacy was prepared to go in wringing formal 'submissions' from the minority even after their defeat in the council. # It offers insight into the ideological basis of the dogma in European political conservatism, monarchism and counter- revolution. # It establishes the doctrine as a key contributing element in the present \\"crisis\\" of the Roman Catholic Church. Mark E. Powell, in his examination of the topic from a Protestant point of view, writes: \\"August Hasler portrays Pius IX as an uneducated, abusive megalomaniac, and Vatican I as a council that was not free. Hasler, though, is engaged in heated polemic and obviously exaggerates his picture of Pius IX. Accounts like Hasler's, which paint Pius IX and Vatican I in the most negative terms, are adequately refuted by the testimony of participants at Vatican I.\\" = Objections by Protestants = Those opposed to papal infallibility such as Geisler and MacKenzieWhat Think Ye of Rome? Part Four: The Catholic-Protestant Debate on Papal Infallibility, Christian Research Journal, Fall 1994, p. 24 say that it is contrary to Scripture and to the teaching of the early Church. * On linguistic grounds and their understanding that Peter's authority was shared, James Robert WhiteJames Robert White, Answers to Catholic Claims, 104‚Äì98; Crowne Publications, Southbridge, MA: 1990 and others say that does not refer to Peter as the Rock. They argue that in this passage Peter is in the second person (\\"you\\"), but that \\"this rock\\", being in the third person, refers to Christ, the subject of Peter's truth confession in verse 16, and the revelation referred to in verse 17, who is explicitly affirmed to be the foundation of the church.petra: Rm. 8:33; 1 Cor. 10:4; 1 Pet. 2:8; lithos: Mat. 21:42; Mk.12:10‚Äì11; Lk. 20:17‚Äì18; Act. 4:11; Rm. 9:33; Eph. 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:4‚Äì8; cf. Dt. 32:4, Is. 28:16; speaks of the church as \\"built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets\\" White cites authorities such as John Chrysostom and St. Augustine of Hippo as supporting this understanding, with Augustine stating, \\"On this rock, therefore, He said, which thou hast confessed. I will build my Church. For the Rock (petra) is Christ; and on this foundation was Peter himself built.\\"Augustine, On the Gospel of John Tractate 12435, The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers Series I, Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1983, 7:450, as cited in White, Answers to Catholic Claims, p. 106 * They understand \\"keys\\" in the Matthean passage and its authority as primarily or exclusively pertaining to the gospel.John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, p. 1105; Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1960 * They see the prayer of Jesus for Peter, that his faith fail not () as not promising infallibility to a papal office, which they hold to be a late and novel doctrine. * While recognizing Peter's significant role in the early church, and his initial brethren-type leadership, they contend that the Book of Acts manifests him as inferior to the apostle Paul in his level of contribution and influence, with Paul becoming the dominant focus in the Biblical records of the early church, and the writer of most of the New Testament (receiving direct revelation), and having authority to publicly reprove Peter. (Gal. 2:11‚Äì14) * Geisler and MacKenzie also see the absence of any reference by Peter referring to himself distinctively, such as the chief of apostles, and instead only as \\"an apostle\\" or \\"an elder\\" (1 Pet. 1:1; 5:1) as weighing against Peter being the supreme and infallible head of the church universal, and indicating he would not accept such titles as Holy Father. * They say that the revelatory function connected to the office of the high priest Caiaphas (Jn. 11:49‚Äì52) does not establish a precedent for Petrine infallibility, since (among other reasons) they infer from that there is no new revelation after the time of the New Testament, as held also by Catholics. * Likewise, they hold that no Jewish infallible magisterium existed, but the faith yet endured, and that the Roman Catholic doctrine on infallibility is a new invention. * They see the promise of papal infallibility as violated by certain popes who spoke heresy (as recognized, they say, by the Roman church itself) under conditions that, they argue, fit the criteria for infallibility.Richard Frederick Littledale, Plain reasons against joining the Church of Rome, pp. 157‚Äì59.E. J. V. Huiginn, From Rome to Protestantism, The Forum, Volume 5, p. 111 * They say that at the Council of Jerusalem Peter was not looked to as the infallible head of the church, with James exercising the more decisive leadership, and providing the definitive sentence;F. F. Bruce, Peter, Stephen, James and John, 86ff; Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1979 and that he is not seen elsewhere as the final and universal arbiter about any doctrinal dispute about faith in the life of the church.Peter De Rosa, Vicars of Christ: the Dark Side of the Papacy * They hold as unwarranted on scriptural and historical grounds the idea that monarchical leadership by an infallible pope is needed or has existed; that the infallible authority is the scriptures rather than an infallible head.E.J.V. Huiginn, From Rome to Protestantism, The Forum, Volume 5, pp. 111‚Äì13 and that church leadership in the New Testament is understood as being that of bishops and elders, denoting the same office, rather than an infallible pope. * They argue further that the doctrine of papal infallibility lacked universal or widespread support in the bulk of church history, and that substantial opposition to it existed within the Catholic Church, even at the time of its official institution, saying that this testifies to its lack of scriptural and historical warrant.Harold O. J. Brown, Protest of a Troubled Protestant, New Rochelle, NY: Arlington House, 1969; p. 122Williston Walker, A History of the Christian Church, 3d ed. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1970; p. 67E.J.V. Huiginn, From Rome to Protestantism, The Forum, Volume 5, pp. 109‚Äì10 * Chapter 7 of Lytton Strachey's biography of Cardinal Manning in Eminent Victorians includes a discussion of papal infallibility and some possible objections.  Positions of some other churches  Eastern Orthodoxy = The dogma of papal infallibility is rejected by Eastern Orthodoxy. Orthodox Christians hold that the Holy Spirit will not allow the whole Body of Orthodox Christians to fall into errorEncyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs of 1848 but leave open the question of how this will be ensured in any specific case. Eastern Orthodoxy considers that the first seven ecumenical councils were infallible as accurate witnesses to the truth of the gospel, not so much on account of their institutional structure as on account of their reception by the Christian faithful. Additionally, Orthodox Christians do not believe that any individual bishop is infallible or that the idea of papal infallibility was taught during the first centuries of Christianity. Orthodox historians often point to the condemnation of Pope Honorius I as a heretic by the Sixth Ecumenical council as a significant indication. However, it is debated whether Honorius' letter to Sergius met (in retrospect) the criteria set forth at Vatican I. Other Orthodox scholarsCleenewerck, Laurent. His Broken Body: Understanding and Healing the Schism between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. pp. 301‚Äì30 argue that past papal statements that appear to meet the conditions set forth at Vatican I for infallible status presented teachings in faith and morals are now acknowledged as problematic. = Anglican churches = The Church of England and its sister churches in the Anglican Communion reject papal infallibility, a rejection given expression in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion (1571): = Methodist Churches = John Wesley amended the Anglican Articles of Religion for use by Methodists, particularly those in America. The Methodist Articles omit the express provisions in the Anglican articles concerning the errors of the Church of Rome and the authority of councils, but retain Article V, which implicitly pertains to the Roman Catholic idea of papal authority as capable of defining articles of faith on matters not clearly derived from Scripture: = Reformed churches = Presbyterian and Reformed churches reject papal infallibility. The Westminster Confession of Faith, which was intended in 1646 to replace the Thirty-Nine Articles, goes so far as to label the Roman pontiff \\"Antichrist\\"; it contains the following statements: = Evangelical churches = Evangelical churches do not believe in papal infallibility for reasons similar to those of Methodist and Reformed Christians. Evangelicals believe that the Bible alone is infallible or inerrant. Most evangelical churches and ministries have statements of doctrine that explicitly say that the Bible, composed of the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament, is the sole rule for faith and practice. Most of these statements, however, are articles of faith that evangelicals affirm in a positive way, and contain no reference to the papacy or other beliefs that are not part of evangelical doctrine. =Non-Christian equivalents= Islam stated the infallibility of the prophets and the Quran, but did not point to a particular authority in the present time as infallible. Popular Shia recognizes the familiars of Muhammad (Ahl al-Bayt) as imams divinely chosen with the privileges of sinlessness and infallibility. Many Sunni Sufi imams claim to be initiated masters and spiritual heirs of the prophet and thus are associated by the believers to the same infallibilityAhl al-Bayt, Encyclopedia of Islam, regardless the sins linked above the lives of their material circles.  Political reactions  British = A British Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, publicly attacked Vatican I, stating that Roman Catholics had \\"... forfeited their moral and mental freedom.\\" He published a pamphlet called The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance in which he described the Catholic Church as \\"an Asian monarchy: nothing but one giddy height of despotism, and one dead level of religious subservience.\\" He further claimed that the Pope wanted to destroy the rule of law and replace it with arbitrary tyranny, and then to hide these \\"... crimes against liberty beneath a suffocating cloud of incense.\\"Philip Magnus, Gladstone: A Biography (London: John Murray, 1963), pp. 235‚Äì36. Cardinal Newman famously responded with his Letter to the Duke of Norfolk. In the letter he argues that conscience, which is supreme, is not in conflict with papal infallibility ‚Äì though he toasts, \\"I shall drink to the Pope if you please ‚Äì still, to conscience first and to the Pope afterwards.\\"Letter to the Duke of Norfolk in The Genius of John Henry Newman: Selections from His Writings. Ed. I. Ker. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990. He stated later that, \\"The Vatican Council left the Pope just as it found him,\\" satisfied that the definition was very moderate, and specific in regards to what specifically can be declared as infallible.Stanley Jaki in Newman's Challenge p. 170 = Bismarck = According to F.B.M. Hollyday, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck feared that Pius IX and future popes would use the infallibility dogma as a weapon for promoting a potential \\"papal desire for international political hegemony\\": One example of the Catholic Church's political actions had already occurred in Italy on 29 February 1868, when the Sacred Penitentiary issued the decree Non Expedit, which declared that a Catholic should be \\"neither elector nor elected\\" in the Kingdom of Italy. The principal motive of this decree was that the oath taken by deputies might be interpreted as an approval of the spoliation of the Holy See, as Pius IX declared in an audience of 11 October 1874. Only in 1888 was the decree declared to be an absolute prohibition rather than an admonition meant for one particular occasion. In 1872 Bismarck attempted to reach an understanding with other European governments, whereby future papal elections would be manipulated. He proposed that European governments should agree beforehand on unsuitable papal candidates, and then instruct their national cardinals to vote in the appropriate manner. This plan was circulated in a note, in which Bismarck wrote: When this scheme did not materialize, Bismarck accelerated his Kulturkampf against the Catholic Church in Germany.

History The squadron was formed on 20 August 1918 from No's 493, 515 & 516 Flights at Mullion, in Cornwall. Equipped with DH6s, it carried out anti-submarine patrols along the coast until the end of the war, disbanding on 15 May 1919. Reformed as a fighter squadron at RAF Stradishall on 31 October 1939, the squadron was equipped with Blenheims. It took them to Bircham Newton in February 1940, where the unit was transferred to Coastal Command. In April it moved to Speke, rejoining Fighter Command and the following month moved to RAF Filton to fly defensive patrols over the English Channel; in July a move to Thorney Island saw it back in Coastal Command, where it stayed for the rest of the war. From August 1940 it operated from bases in the south-west of England, carrying out anti-shipping patrols over the Channel, and Irish Sea, having re-equipped with Beaufighters in October 1941. On 12 June, a Beaufighter flown by a volunteer crew of Flight Lieutenant A. K. Gatward and Sergeant G. Fern made a solo sortie to Paris intending to disrupt a noon parade of German troops down the Champs-Elysees. On arrival it was seen that there was no parade but dropped a French tricolore over the empty avenue and shot up the secondary target of the Gestapo headquarters in the Ministry of Marine on the Place de la Concorde before returning.Royal Air Force 1939-1945: Volume II The Fight Avails p 143 It was transferred to RAF Wattisham in February 1942 and reduced to a cadre. It received new Beaufighters in March and resumed its previous duties, although these were now flown over the North Sea, with detachments in the south-west who undertook similar duties over the Bay of Biscay. In September 1942 the squadron moved to North Coates and in April 1943 became a part of the strike wing formed there, operating as such until the end of the war. The squadron disbanded on 25 May 1945. ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Halley, James J. The Squadrons of the Royal Air Force & Commonwealth, 1918-1988.

Retrieved 30 August 2012.Rawlings 1982, p. 179. =Second World War= The Squadron remained disbanded until after the outbreak of the Second World War, reforming at RAF Hendon as a Night Fighter squadron. It received its first aircraft, Bristol Blenheim IFs, a fighter modification of the twin engined light bomber in December that year. The squadron was still working up when it was transferred to Coastal Command in February 1940, swapping its Blenheim IFs for slightly more modern Blenheim IVFs and moving to RAF North Coates in Lincolnshire. It transferred back to Fighter Command on 22 April 1940, flying fighter patrols over the North Sea from RAF Dyce, Aberdeen and RAF Montrose, and returning to Coastal Command control on 20 June. The squadron moved to RAF Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands on 31 July 1940, flying reconnaissance and anti-shipping missions off the coast of Norway until it returned to Dyce in January 1941, adding convoy escort to its reconnaissance missions, with a detachment based at RAF Wick in Caithness. In June 1941 the squadron transferred to RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk, where it re-equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter in July, flying its first missions with the new aircraft on 14 August. It carried out convoy escort missions and strikes against shipping off the Dutch coast from Bircham Newton, while a detachment from the squadron was sent to Cornwall to carry out long-range fighter patrols over the Western Approaches between September and December that year. The squadron moved back to Dyce again in February 1942, flying patrols and escorting strikes by Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers off Norway.Halley 1980, pp. 248‚Äì249.

Once back in the UK and with a fresh set of Beaufighters, the Squadron was tasked with carrying out fighter patrols over the Western Approaches and Bay of Biscay as part of No. 19 Group RAF from RAF Talbenny in Pembrokeshire. Together with fellow Beaufighter squadron No. 235, 248 had the particular role of opposing German Junkers Ju 88 fighters that were attacking Allied anti- submarine aircraft over the Bay of Biscay, with repeated combats taking place though the spring and summer of 1943, with the Squadron receiving Beaufighter Xs in June 1943, adding anti-shipping strikes to its missions and operating a detachment from Gibraltar.Goss 1997, p. 17. In December 1943, the Squadron started to receive de Havilland Mosquito FB VI fighter-bombers, flying its final missions on the Beaufighter in January 1944 and its first patrols on the Mosquito in February that year. In March its Mosquito FB.VIs were supplemented by a detachment of ex-618 Squadron Mosquito FB.XVIIIs (nicknamed Tsetse), equipped with a 6-pounder (57 mm) cannon. The squadron used the Tsetses to attack shipping, and in particular German submarines, while the more conventional Mosquito FB.VIs provided fighter cover. On 10 May 1944, six Mosquitos of 248 Squadron, including two Tsetse aircraft, were ordered to attack the Japanese submarine I-29, carrying a cargo of rubber, tungsten, gold bullion and 25 Japanese senior naval officers, off Cape Pe√±as in northern Spain. The I-29 had a heavy escort, including two destroyers and two torpedo boats, together with air cover of eight Ju 88s. 248 Squadron claimed to have shot down three Ju 88s (one by the six-pounder gun of one of the Tsetses) and damaged I-29. In fact, only one Ju 88 was shot down and I-29 was undamaged.Goss 1997, pp. 153‚Äì154.Blair 2000, p. 539.

It features Shreyas Talpade, Kay Kay Menon, Mahi Gill, Shenaz Treasurywala and Shiv Panditt in the lead roles. It was produced by Ronnie Screwvala under the UTV Motion Pictures. The film released on 4 September 2009 and although it failed to do well at the box office, it was praised for its lavish title sequence, looks and design. Plot Dinkar Waghmare (Shreyas Talpade) hails from a small town. He is a 28-year-old sub-inspector with the Mumbai Police who spends his time dreaming of beautiful TV reporter Soniya Bhatt (Mahi Gill). He has never solved a case and has always stayed away from serious action. His late father was a successful police officer. He is constantly reminded of his failure by his nagging mother and feels pressure to live up to his father's larger-than-life image. One day Dinkar loses his Bajrangbali- stickered gun and is under extreme pressure to find it. Meanwhile, terrorist Balma Rashid-ul-Khairi (Kay Kay Menon), alias Janu, has arrived in Mumbai planning to bomb several locations in the city. However, he falls in love with Mumbai life and a bargirl named Pearl (Shenaz Treasurywala). But when Janu abandons his life of violence to romance Pearl, his chief comes to Mumbai to complete his mission and kill both Janu and Pearl. As he pursues his gun around Mumbai, Dinkar accidentally becomes a hero when he saves the mayor's life and then prevents the daughter of the police commissioner from committing suicide. He meets Soniya who falls in love with the city's new hero. He is promoted to inspector and is assigned to head security at the Mumbai Police Show. The terrorist chief plants a bomb under the stage as planned, but Janu comes to defuse it as it is about to explode when Pearl starts her number. With the help of Dinkar, Janu defuses the bomb. The terrorist's plot is foiled and Dinkar is able to retrieve his gun and avoid humiliation. Cast * Shreyas Talpade as Dinkar Waghmare * Kay Kay Menon as Janu a.k.a.

The timing of the theatrical release was at the time of Muharram a time of religious austerity for the audience. The film also failed to garner immediate critical acclaim though reports from the audience was positive with unofficial blogs being written on the movie as the most underrated gem of the year and fair amount of positive viewer comments.

The following year, a group of 15 professionals met for the first board meeting of the American Society for Training Directors in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. They became the governing body of the association, which convened its membership in Chicago in 1945. Other local, regional, and industry- specific training groups gradually aligned with ASTD.

Lawrence Summers, then the Director of the NEC, who had previously announced that he would return at the end of the year to Harvard University, noted that Farrell had \\"played a central role\\" in the efforts of the administration to encourage economic growth, restructure the auto industry, and respond to the housing crisis. Summers further stated: \\"Her natural talent as a policy maker and her good judgment made her invaluable in setting a course for economic recovery.\\" Research and political views In 2003, Farrell was the author of a paper in which she argued that sending American jobs overseas might be \\"as beneficial to the U.S. as to the destination country, probably more so.\\" In a video for the McKinsey Global Institute, where she formerly served as a director, Farrell describes four \\"newly powerful\\" brokers. One of these is \\"Asian economies which are...generating significant surpluses.\\" Farrell has stated that she would like to see more alumni of the corporate sector serving in government, stating in an interview that \\"This is my first time serving in government ‚Äî I came from the private sector ‚Äî and I just think it is a fantastic thing for people to do, for people in the private sector to serve in government, to serve their country, and to really understand what a very large fraction of the economy and society is all about and how this works.\\" Following the 2008 financial crisis, Farrell argued that governments had \\"overextended themselves\\" in the aftermath of the recession and called for \\"structural reforms\\" in an October 2012 interview. Farrell is a supporter of regulation of large banks. In an interview with National Public Radio, she stated: \\"We have created them, and we're sort of past that point, and I think that in some sense, the genie's out of the bottle and what we need to do is to manage them and to oversee them, as opposed to hark back to a time that we're unlikely to ever come back to or want to come back to.\\" Selected publications \\"Government by Design: Four Principles for a Better Public Sector\\", McKinsey Center for Government, December 2013 \\"Education to Employment: Designing a System That Works\\", McKinsey Center for Government, December 2012 \\"Government Designed for New Times\\", McKinsey Center for Government, October 2012 ‚ÄúNew but not yet normal: Corporate and investment banking in transition‚Äù, McKinsey on Corporate & Investment Banking, September 2010 ‚ÄúChanging the fortunes of America's workforce: A human capital challenge‚Äù, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2009 ‚ÄúPromoting energy efficiency in the developing world‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, February 2009 ‚ÄúWhy Americans pay more for health care‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, December 2008 ‚ÄúLeading through uncertainty‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, December 2008 ‚ÄúThe challenge of reforming Japan‚Äôs health system‚Äù, McKinsey Global Institute, November 2008 ‚ÄúWhy baby boomers will need to work longer‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, November 2008 ‚ÄúNew thinking for a new financial order‚Äù, Harvard Business Review, September 2008 ‚ÄúCapturing the European energy productivity opportunity‚Äù, McKinsey Global Institute, September 2008 ‚ÄúBoosting Europe‚Äôs energy productivity‚Äù, Businessweek, September 2008 ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs urbanization means rich rewards for business‚Äù, Businessweek, September 2008 ‚ÄúHow the world should invest in energy efficiency‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, July 2008 ‚ÄúThe rise of the euro‚Äù, Businessweek, March 2008 ‚ÄúInvesting the Gulf‚Äôs oil profits windfall‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, May 2008 ‚ÄúThe challenge of funding Japan‚Äôs future health care needs‚Äù, McKinsey Global Institute, March 2008 ‚ÄúGulf states must use oil wealth wisely‚Äù, Businessweek, February 2008 ‚ÄúLong-term trends in global capital markets‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, February 2008 ‚ÄúThe new role of oil wealth in the world economy‚Äù, McKinsey Quarterly, January 2008 Offshoring: Understanding the Emerging Global Labor Market, Harvard Business Press Books, 2006 Driving Growth: Breaking Down Barriers to Global Prosperity, Harvard Business Press Books, 2006 Productivity Imperative: Wealth and Poverty in the Global Economy, Harvard Business Press Books, 2006 ‚ÄúSmarter offshoring‚Äù, Harvard Business Review, June 2006 Market Unbound, Wiley & Sons, 1996 ReferencesExternal links *Biography at McKinsey & Company Public Sector Practice Biography at McKinsey & Company, World Economic Forum 2005 *Author info at Bloomberg Businessweek *Biography at UN.org Category:1965 births Category:American people of Colombian descent Category:American politicians of Colombian descent Category:Assistants to the President of the United States Category:Colombian emigrants to the United States Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Living people Category:McKinsey & Company people Category:Obama administration personnel Category:Urban Institute people Category:Wesleyan University alumni ","title":"Diana Farrell"},{"id":"21701394","text":"Ruben Sergio Rojas (born 22 November 1973 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a striker.

Born to an aristocratic family, Robles embraced left-wing views which forced him to leave Spain and go into exile in the United States. In the 1920s, he was teaching at Johns Hopkins University and became a friend and Spanish language translator for writer John Dos Passos, who at the time also supported the radical left. His translation of Manhattan Transfer is still considered to be exemplary. He also translated some works of Sinclair Lewis. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Robles was on vacation in Spain. He supported the cause of the Spanish Republic, but his independent and outspoken views brought him in conflict with the Soviet Union's emissaries, who were gaining increasing control of the Republican government. In early 1937 Robles disappeared. The American left-wing journalist Josephine Herbst, then on a visit to the Civil War front, found out that he had been arrested and shot as an alleged \\"spy for Francoists\\", and conveyed this information to Ernest Hemingway and Dos Passos who were in Madrid. The exact circumstances of his death were never clarified, and the charge of his having spied for the Nationalists was doubted. Rather, it was suggested that he was among many other left-wingers (for example, Andr√©s Nin) killed by Soviet NKVD agents, led by Alexander Orlov, for their independent stance at the time. In a letter to the editor published in The New Republic in July 1939, Dos Passos wrote that it was not until he reached Madrid (after having spent a week in Valencia) that he got what he called \\"definite information from the then chief of the Republican counter-espionage service that Robles had been executed by a 'special section' (which I gathered was under control of the Communist Party) ‚Ä¶ Spaniards I talked to closer to the Communist Party took the attitude that Robles had been shot as an example to other officials because he had been overheard indiscreetly discussing military plans in a cafe. The 'fascist spy' theory seems to be the fabrication of romantic American Communist sympathizers. I certainly did not hear it from any Spaniards.\\"Carr (1984), p. 365. According to research by writer Stephen Koch, the real reason Robles was killed was that he had been the translator of Yan Karlovich Berzin, a senior Soviet military envoy to Spain who knew no Spanish. When Berzin disputed with NKVD official Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov about the relative priority to be given to preserving the military efficiency of Spanish Republican forces vs. conducting NKVD purges of Spanish Anarchists, POUM etc., and lost the favor of Stalin as a result, then Robles' knowledge of behind-the-scenes Soviet maneuverings in Spain became highly inconvenient to the Soviets.Koch (1994), pp. 283ff. Robles' execution caused a total rift between Hemingway and Dos Passos, who were previously friends. Hemingway condoned the killing, as \\"necessary in time of war\\", while Dos Passos, embittered by the death of his friend, broke away from the left altogether and started his move to the political right. Robles' last days before his disappearance are shown in a 2012 movie Hemingway & Gellhorn. References * \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\".

Early life and family Born in the Auckland suburb of Ponsonby on 18 December 1916, Crump was the son of William Arthur Harry Crump and Ellen Spenceley Crump (n√©e Walker). He was educated at Takapuna Grammar School, where he was the senior swimming champion in 1933, and was a member of the North Shore Amateur Swimming and Lifesaving Club. In July 1943, Crump married Eileen Hilda Wallace, a theatre sister at Rotorua Public Hospital, at Trinity Presbyterian Church, Cambridge. Swimming At the 1934 New Zealand national swimming championships, Crump won both the 100 yards and 220 yards men's freestyle titles. He was then selected to represent New Zealand at the 1934 British Empire Games in London, where he won the bronze medal in the men's 100 yards freestyle, and was also a member of the New Zealand team that finished fifth in the 3x110yards medley relay. Four years later, he again competed at the British Empire Games, this time in Sydney, where he did not progress beyond the heats of the men's 110 yards and 440 yards freestyle events. Later life and death A bank officer, Crump served with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force during World War II. He embarked as a second lieutenant with the first echelon, and saw active service in Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Libya, before being invalided home in mid 1942. Promoted to the rank of captain, he then served as adjutant at the Raventhorpe Convalescent Depot in Bombay.

Origins The Maalouf family belongs to the group of tribes known as Ghassanids that emigrated from Yemen to Houran in modern Syria prior to the collapse of the Marib Dam () around 102 AD The clan governed Houran and large surrounding regions for nearly 500 years until the Islamic conquest in 637 AD. After the arrival of Islam, some members converted to Islam while most remained Christian mainly Antiochian Eastern- Orthodox and Melkite Greek Catholic. Several prominent leaders received the special appellation of Maayuf () meaning ‚Äúexempted‚Äù or ‚Äúprotected.‚Äù When the ruling government subsequently rescinded this appellation, many clan members retained it in the form of a surname Maalouf, or Al-Maalouf. Ibrahim Maalouf nicknamed \\"Abi Rajih\\" () reflecting his wisdom was a prominent and rich landowner in the town or village of Upper Damia in Houran. He had seven sons: Issa (), Medlej (), Farah (), Hanna (), Nasser (), Nehme (), and Semaan (). For political, social and religious reasons, and as a result of a conflict that his family engaged in with neighboring clans in 1519 AD, Ibrahim decided to sell his land and leave Houran for the mountains of Lebanon, an area that became known for its rule of law under the Ottoman Empire. The family crossed ash-ShƒÅm and the plains of Damascus, over the Anti-Lebanon mountain range, and at first settled for a few years in the village of Seriin () to the northwest of the town of Zahl√© in the Bekaa Valley. However, this stay was short lived due to conflicts with existing residents. In 1526 AD, Ibrahim decided to move from the Bekaa Valley to Bsharri () in the high mountains of northern Lebanon. The route to Bsharri was difficult, and when the family stumbled onto an abandoned mountain village, they decided to resettle it. After rebuilt the structures, the village was named Douma () in commemoration of the original Maalouf village in Houran. A church named for Saint Sarkis, venerated by the Christians of Houran, was also built in the village. The stay in Douma was pleasant as the clan developed friendly relations with their neighbors and the ruling emir. However the murder of a ruler of Tripoli over his desire to marry one of the Maalouf daughters forced them to depart to the safety of Keserwan District that was ruled by an emir friendly to the family. Upon arrival at Antelias, the clan decided that the families of Issa, Medlej, Farah and Hanna would settle in the high mountains of the Keserwan District, while the families of Nasser and Nehme would head to Vayelet Damasc, while the family of Semaan would stay on the coast near Antelias. The families of Issa, Medlej and Farah retained the surname of Maalouf, whereas the other branches adopted other surnames, notably Klink for the Hanna branch, Kreidy for the Semaan branch, Laham for the Nasser branch, and Najjar for the Nehme branch. A panoramic photograph of the village of Kfarakab established by the Maalouf family c. 1560 AD To the far right is the edge of Mhaydse which has become part of the modern town of Bikfaya. The first four branches settled in the village of Mhaydse () in 1550 AD and lived peacefully for several years. From their homes, they observed across a deep ravine an attractive, protected and forested ridge which they often used as a hunting ground. After receiving permission from the ruling emir, the families of Issa, Medlej and Farah relocated their homes and built the village of Kfarakab () in 1560 AD and the main church in 1570 AD The family of Hanna remained in Mhaidsse. Kfarakab become the core settlement of the Maalouf clan and gave the family the opportunity to play an integral role in the social, economical, political and military developments in Lebanon. From Kfarakab, thousands of descendants migrated across Lebanon, and later, internationally, especially since the late 1800s, settling in the United States of America, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Australia. The Maalouf family is now prominent in several Lebanese towns and villages, most notably Zahl√© where an entire neighborhood is named after the family, Niha, and Chlifa, in the Beqaa Valley. The Maalouf family's rich history is marked by a dedication to culture and education. The family contributed to Al-Nahda.The Making of Arab Americans: From Syrian Nationalism to U.S. Citizenship by Hani J.

It was reported in October 2013 that most members were to switch to the United States-based Mongols Motorcycle Club. Perth chapter The Perth chapter of the Finks were formed after Troy Mercanti was expelled from the Coffin Cheaters and joined his friend and South Australian Fink member Frank Condo in forming the Perth chapter in 2008. Other eastern states members came to Perth to start the chapter, but over time all, including Condo, either left the club or returned to their original states. The commencement of the Perth chapter caused friction between the Finks and the Coffin Cheaters Perth. The Perth Finks clubhouse has been frozen under the proceeds of crime after Mercanti's then partner Tammy Kingdon was convicted by a District Court jury in November 2010 of four counts of stealing and one count of property laundering. Kingdon funnelled money from a Coffin Cheaters trust fund set up for the daughters of Marc Chabriere, who was a Coffin Cheaters member murdered during the 1998 bikie war between the Coffin Cheaters and the Club Deroes. The stolen money from the fund was used to purchase the Finks clubhouse. During the Motorplex brawl Fink member Stephen Wallace had three fingers severed. Finks members Clovis Chikonga, Troy Smith, Stephen Laurence Silvestro, Tristan Roger Allbeury, and Stephen Wallace were all imprisoned for two years despite pleas from their lawyer that Allbeury had bipolar disorder, ADHD and suffered post-traumatic stress. Wallace is the long-term boyfriend of fellow convicted heroin trafficker Holly Deane-Johns, who served time in WA before arrest in Thailand in 2000 for trying to mail 10.4 grams of heroin to Perth. She was jailed in 2003 for 31 years before her prisoner transfer deal in 2007. Allbeury is currently held on remand after being charged by Gang Crime Squad Detectives with Attempting to Pervert the Course of Justice. Allbeury is also charged with Grievous Bodily Harm over a prison assault that broke a fellow inmates jaw. In September 2012, whilst in prison, Allbeury was found with a smart phone and cannabis in his cell. Mercanti was arrested in January 2012 by the Gang Crime Squad and jailed in March 2013 for 6 years and 10 months after pleading guilty late in his trial to domestic violence charges against his former partner Tammy Kingdon. Increasing drug and alcohol use were blamed for the 15 years of abuse. In October 2013 the Perth Finks were patched over by the Mongols MC. Eastern states chapters In 2012, Finks member Mark James Graham was charged with the attempted murder of Bandidos member Jacques Teamo in a shooting at the Robina Town Centre shopping centre.

She was first elected in 2009 provincial general election to the 39th and then re-elected in 2013 to the 40th, both times as a member of the official opposition with the British Columbia New Democratic Party. While in opposition, she has served predominately as the critic for the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. She introduced two private members bills: the British Columbia Local Food Act and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Mink Farms) Amendment Act. Popham owns and operates the organic grape orchard, Barking Dog Vineyard, on Vancouver Island. Her background in community work has included participating in campaigns to reduce excessive automobile driving and to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags within the Capital Regional District. Background Though born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Lana Popham was raised on Quadra Island, one of the Discovery Islands off the central-east coast of Vancouver Island. She graduated from the University of British Columbia with a bachelor of arts in geography and a major in urban planning. She married an Oak Bay firefighter and together they had a son. In 1997, they developed Barking Dog Vineyard, which, in 2000, became the first certified organic vineyard on Vancouver Island. She has participated in numerous organizations, including the Island Organic Producers Association, the Peninsula Agricultural Commission. In 2005, she served as president of the Wine Islands Growers Association. She has been a member of several District of Saanich committees, including planning, transportation, and economic development committees. In 2007 she engaged in the \\"100 km Less\\" campaign challenging people to eliminate 100 kilometres from their weekly driving. In 2008 she campaigned to reduce or ban plastic shopping bags in the Capital Regional District, in favour of reusable bags. Popham was a candidate in the 2005 Saanich municipal elections, but did not win a seat on council. She began campaigning for the 2008 municipal elections but withdrew to run for the provincial NDP nomination in the Saanich South riding. The MLA, New Democrat David Cubberley, had announced he would not run in the next election and party rules required that his successor be female. Being unopposed, Popham was acclaimed the NDP candidate in Saanich South for the 2009 provincial general election. The Saanich South election was expected to be one of the closest in the province with Popham facing former CHEK-TV reporter and news anchor and BC Liberal candidate Robin Adair, lawyer and Western Canada Concept Party leader Doug Christie, and Green Party candidate Brian Gordon. Popham was one of four candidates in the province endorsed by the Conservation Voters of BC. Popham won the May 12 election by 482 votes and her party formed the official opposition. 39th Parliament In the 39th Parliament she served as a member on the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts and was the NDP agriculture and lands critic. To understand provincial agricultural issues better, in the summer 2009, Popham and Cariboo North MLA Bob Simpson toured the BC Interior where they met with agricultural organizations and local producers. She joined with fellow NDP MLAs Scott Fraser and Claire Trevena, in conjunction with the Western Canada Wilderness Committee, in lobbying for the stop to old-growth logging on Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland. In August 2011, while Popham was out of town, her constituency office experienced a roof fire. In November 2010, Popham became one of 13 NDP caucus members to call for a leadership review of Carole James. Under James' successor, Adrian Dix, Popham remained agriculture critic and they advocated for health authorities to use local food in hospitals, reinstating the Buy B.C. program, easing the regulations that restrict meat processing sales, and lobbied the Province of Ontario for compatible labeling laws in support of a proposed federal law that would allow inter-provincial sales of wine. Popham was featured in the 2011 Canadian documentary film Peace Out where she spoke about the food supply ramifications of flooding the Peace River Valley for the controversial Site C dam proposal.https://www.straight.com/movies/peace-out- documentary-brings-site-c-dam-debate-viff-2011 Popham's public position on agricultural issues include reinstating the Buy B.C. program, making it more difficult to remove land from the Agricultural Land reserve and reinstating agricultural extension officers. Popham opposes the commercial production of the genetically engineered Arctic Apple, arguing it could negatively affect the reputation of BC fruit. She is a leading proponent of increased protection for native pollinators and honey bees on Vancouver Island, maintaining a blog on the subject. Popham delivered an overview of the BCNDP's agriculture plan on March 4 and 5, 2013 to the BC Legislature. 40th Parliament She ran for re-election in the provincial election May 14, 2013 and was re- elected.http://www.leg.bc.ca/mla/40thparl/popham-Lana.htm However, Popham's party lost the general election and again formed the official opposition. Party leader Adrian Dix appointed Popham to a critic role focusing on small business, tourism, arts and culture. With resignation of Dix as leader and the subsequent leadership election, Popham again endorsed Mike Farnworth. However, Farnworth withdrew his nomination and John Horgan went on to become leader. Horgan reassigned Popham back to critic on agriculture and food, though he would later add critic role for small business back to her duties. During the 40th Parliament of British Columbia, Popham introduced two private member bills, neither of which advanced beyond first reading. In May 2015 during the fourth session, and again in May 2016 during the fifth session, she introduced the British Columbia Local Food Act (Bill M-222) which would have established a Food and Agricultural Committee in the legislative assembly, require the committee to establish a Local Food Strategy, and make recommendation for appointments to the Agricultural Land Commission, move the Zone 2 areas of the Agricultural Land Reserve into Zone 1, and re-establish the Ministry of Agriculture's Buy BC marketing program. In May 2016, Popham also introduce the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Mink Farms) Amendment Act (Bill M-237) which would have implemented the National Farm Animal Care Council's code of practice for farmed mink. 41st Parliament In the 2017 election, she was challenged by Olympic rower Dave Calder on behalf of the BC Liberal Party, her son's former teacher, Mark Neufeld for the Green Party, Andrew McLean for the Libertarian Party, and Richard Pattee for the newly-created Vancouver Island Party. Though Popham won the riding, her party again formed the official opposition as the 41st Parliament began. After the governing BC Liberal Party lost a confidence vote and the BC NDP formed the government, Popham was appointed to be Minister of Agriculture in Premier John Horgan's Executive Council. In this role, Popham oversaw the implementation of BC NDP's agricultural platform of reforming the Agricultural Land Commission and developing the Grow BC, Feed BC and Buy BC initiatives. She introduced the Agricultural Land Commission Amendment Act, 2018 (Bill 52) and the Agricultural Land Commission Amendment Act, 2019 (Bill 15) which, among other items, undid the previous parliament's division of the Agricultural Land Reserve into two zones with different regulations and reduced the amount of housing permitted on agricultural land.

Prior to his marriage to the heir apparent, Crown Princess Victoria, Daniel was a personal trainer and gym owner and ran a company called Balance Training with three gyms in central Stockholm.Interview (in Swedish) by Sveriges Television broadcast 19 June 2010 Background and early life Daniel was born to Olle and Ewa Westling (born Ewa Westring) at √ñrebro Hospital, on the day Carl XVI Gustaf ascended the throne. His family initially lived in √ñrebro, but later moved to Ockelbo. He has a sister, Anna Westling S√∂derstr√∂m (formerly Anna Westling Blom, born Anna Westling; 1970). Most of his ancestors were farmers in the province of H√§lsingland. Daniel Westling was christened at Almby Church in January 1974. His family has Forest Finnish ancestry and his father is a leader in the Forest Finnish community. After completing his education, he briefly served, as part of national conscription, in the Swedish Army at H√§lsinge Regiment in G√§vle. In 2001, he met the Crown Princess when he became her personal trainer. On 1 July 2008, he moved into a one-bedroom rental apartment in the Pagebyggnaden building on the grounds of Drottningholm Palace. The move was confirmed by the Royal Court. Career In November 2009 it was reported that Daniel Westling was to step down as CEO and member of the Board of Directors of the Balance company. He will still be an equity partner. It was expected that the same procedure would be followed with his involvements in other companies, before he became prince. His business positions: Balance ‚Äì CEO and member of the Board of Directors (stepped down November 2009); Master Training ‚Äì CEO and member of the Board of Directors; Brasil Development ‚Äì member of the Board of Directors. Engagement and marriage Madeleine, 2013. On 24 February 2009, Westling and Crown Princess Victoria received the required consent of King Carl XVI Gustaf and the Government of Sweden for marriage. Such permission is necessary according to the terms of the Swedish Act of Succession. Westling suffered from a congenital (but not hereditary) ailment causing impaired renal function. Three months after his engagement, on 28 May 2009, Westling underwent a kidney transplant at Karolinska University Hospital. His father was the donor. The operation was a success. Victoria could not be present when the operation took place because she was in Greenland at the time. The wedding took place in Stockholm Cathedral on 19 June 2010, the 34th anniversary of her parents' wedding. After the wedding, the Duke and Duchess of V√§sterg√∂tland moved into the Haga Palace. On 26 September 2010, Daniel went on his first tour with Victoria, visiting France in connection with the Bernadotte anniversary. On 17 August 2011, the Swedish royal court announced that Prince Daniel and Crown Princess Victoria were expecting their first child in March 2012. She gave birth to a girl on 23 February 2012, Princess Estelle, Duchess of √ñsterg√∂tland. Daniel took his paternity leave and switched parental roles with Victoria when Estelle began preschool. Their second child, Prince Oscar, Duke of Sk√•ne, was born on 2 March 2016.  Charity work  Patronage = Prince Daniel is a patron in the following organizations: A Swedish Classic, The Healthy Generation Foundation, International Society of Nephrology, More Organ Donation. = Areas of work = Health  The Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland is a honorary chairman of the board of the Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation and has given his name to Prince Daniel's Grant for Promising Young Researchers. Prince Daniel invented Prince Daniel's Race and Sports Day, which are arranged each year to encourage more young people to get exercise and to take an interest in sport. The game is in association with the Swedish Sports Confederation. Prince Daniel and Crown Princess Victoria established a foundation to mark the occasion of their marriage in 2010. The focus of the foundation is to combat exclusion and promote good health among children and young people in Sweden. The couple took the initiative for Generation PEP, a non-profit organisation that works to raise awareness of and encourage commitment to issues relating to the health of children and young people.  Entrepreneurship  Each year, Prince Daniel visits the Swedish Young Enterprise Championship. He is also a member of Young Enterprise's national board. The Prince Daniel's Fellowship project and its entrepreneurial programme were launched in January 2013. Prince Daniel with business leaders and entrepreneurs visits upper secondary schools, universities and university colleges around Sweden to inspire young people to get involved in entrepreneurship. This project is a long-term partnership between Prince Daniel and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. Titles, styles, honours and arms Royal monogram =Titles and styles= Sweden has practised absolute primogeniture only since 1980. This means that Victoria is the first female heir apparent, and questions arose as to how Daniel Westling would be known after their marriage. When Carl XVI Gustaf married Silvia Sommerlath in 1976, he discontinued the established norm that Swedish princes must marry royalty to be eligible to inherit the throne. But men, royal or not, had only twice before, in the 13th and 17th centuries, obtained new title or rank as the spouse of a Swedish princess, and even three queens regnant left no clear precedent. Margaret (reigned 1388‚Äì1412) was the widow of H√•kon VI of Norway and Christina (reigned 1632‚Äì1654) was unmarried. The most recent Ulrika Eleonora (reigned 1718‚Äì1720) was already married during her tenure as queen regnant: her husband, Frederick, was given the style \\"Royal Highness\\" during his tenure as consort, a style granted to him by the estates. Ulrika Eleonora later abdicated so her consort Frederick‚Äîwho was born a prince of Hesse-Kassel‚Äîcould be king. In Daniel's case, the Swedes were treading on new ground. The Swedish Royal Court announced that Westling would become \\"Prince Daniel\\" and \\"Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland\\", corresponding in form to the style used by previous Swedish princes, including Victoria's younger brother Prince Carl Philip, Duke of V√§rmland, i.e. Prince + Given name + Duke of [Province]. As was further announced in May 2010, on his wedding day Westling was made a prince of Sweden and was granted the style Royal Highness, making him an official member of the Swedish royal family and on a par with other senior members of the royal family, such as Prince Carl Philip, Princess Madeleine and Princess Lilian. At Stockholm Cathedral, he was also then made a knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim and already wore its badge and ribbon upon emerging after the ceremony. Since his marriage, Daniel has been styled as \\"His Royal Highness Prince Daniel, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland\\". He added the surname of the Swedish royal family, Bernadotte, making his full legal name Olof Daniel Westling Bernadotte. When referring to both him and his wife, they are called the Crown Princess Couple (). =Honours=National honours * : Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (LoK av KMO) * : Knight Commander of the Royal Order of the Polar Star (KNO2kl) * : Recipient of the Ruby Jubilee Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf * : Recipient of the 70th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf Foreign honours * : Grand Cross of the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins * : Grand Cross of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana * : Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland * : Grand Cross of the Order of the FalconRoyal Central *: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republichttps://www.quirinale.it/onorificenze/insigniti/357188/http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/18954#&gid;=1&pid;=2/ * : Grand Gwanghwa Medal of the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit * : Grand Officer of the Order of Merit =Arms= Prince Daniel's coat of arms is based on the greater coat of arms of Sweden.

For instance, some investors want a company that doesn't pay dividends but instead invests that money in growing the business, whereas other investors prefer a stock that pays a high dividend, and still others want one that balances payout and reinvestment.

Early years G≈Çowacki was born on 10 February 1910 in Warsaw, attending a local primary school and graduating from the Radio Engineering School. He attended the Wawelberg and Rotwand Advanced Constructing and Electronics School, a technical school and between 1928 and 1930 he was the head of the laboratory in the Philips plants in Poland. After enrolling in basic military training, G≈Çowacki entered air training at Lublinek airfield near Lodz. After 1935, he became an officer serving in 1 Air Wing in Warsaw. In 1938, G≈Çowacki completed a specialist course at the Air Force Training Centre No.1 in Deblin, and was retained there as a flying instructor, as the Polish Air Force was in great need of new recruits. He joined other instructors such as Jan Zumbach and Janusz ≈ªurakowski. Second World War During \\"Black September\\", (September 1939), the Dƒôblin unit was unable to mount a defence and G≈Çowacki joined a reconnaissance platoon of the Warsaw Armoured-Motorised Brigade, commanded by Flight Lieutenant Julian Lagowski. At the collapse of the Polish resistance in late September, G≈Çowacki fled to Romania where along with thousands of other Polish soldiers and airmen, he was interned. He made his way to France via the sea, as the Battle of France was imminent, and was ordered to join the first 100 pilots selected to train as a bomber pilot in England. On arrival in England on 28 January 1940, they were transferred by the RAF to fighter squadrons which were rapidly being deployed in anticipation of an attack on Britain in 1940. After initial training at No. 6 OTU in Sutton Bridge, G≈Çowacki was posted to No. 501 RAF \\"County of Gloucester\\" Fighter Squadron on 5 August 1940 as a sergeant pilot flying Hawker Hurricanes.Gretzyngier 2001, p. 15. =Battle of Britain= G≈Çowacki was immediately involved in uneventful daily sorties for 10 days (building up his total flying time on Hurricanes to 50 hours), until 15 July when the squadron intercepted Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers.Gretzyngier 2001, p. 258. His first combat sorties in Hurricane I, SD-A (VZ124) resulted in a Ju 87 and later in the same day, a Dornier Do 215 destroyed. His squadron was deployed four times throughout the day, intercepting raiders over Dover. Unlike other RAF pilots, G≈Çowacki preferred to fly one aircraft exclusively, SD-A (V7234), which he considered his \\"lucky Hurricane.\\" Gretzyngier 2001, p. 35.

Subject 1851 standing portrait (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) Marie-Clotilde-In√®s de Foucauld (1821‚Äì1897) was the daughter of a French civil servant in the department of forests and waterways.Tinterow; Conisbee et al, 426 In 1842 she married a widower twice her age, the rich banker and lace merchant Sigisbert Moitessier, thus becoming Madame Moitessier. In 1844 Ingres was approached by his longtime friend and former painting subject Charles Marcotte, who was one of Sigisbert Moitessier's colleagues, with the idea of painting Madame Moitessier's portrait. Reluctant at this stage in his career to accept portrait commissions‚Äîhe considered portraiture to be a lower form of art than history painting‚Äîhe initially refused Marcotte's request. However, when Ingres met Madame Moitessier, he was struck by her beauty and agreed to produce a portrait. Art critic Th√©ophile Gautier, who watched during some of the painting sessions, agreed with Ingres, describing her beauty as the most regal, magnificent, stately and Junoesque that he had ever seen drawn. Two portraits He began work on the seated version, depicting the subject in a floral dress. Work on the commission proceeded slowly. The painting was originally to include the Moitessiers' daughter, Catherine; Ingres, finding little Catherine \\"impossible\\", eliminated her from the composition sometime around 1847.Tinterow; Conisbee et al., 431 Work on the painting was suspended in 1849, when the death in June of Ingres' wife left him unable to work for several months, and Madame Moitessier was distracted by her second pregnancy and the death of her father.Tinterow; Conisbee et al., 433 In June 1851, having been reminded by the woman he called \\"la belle et bonne\\" (\\"the beautiful and good\\") that her portrait had still not been completed, Ingres began afresh, painting the standing portrait of her in a dark dress, which he finished in December 1851. He then returned to the seated portrait, which he completed in 1856, twelve years after he started it. Characteristically, Ingres found inspiration in the art of the past when painting Madame Moitessier.

Otherkin are a subculture who socially and spiritually identify as not entirely human. Some otherkin claim that their identity is genetic, while others believe their identity derives from reincarnation, trans-species dysphoria of the soul, ancestry, or metaphor. Joseph P. Laycock, assistant professor of religious studies at Texas State University, considers the belief to be religious. Description Otherkin largely identify as mythical creatures, with others identifying as creatures from fantasy or popular culture. Examples include: angels, demons, dragons, elves, fairies, sprites, aliens, and cartoon characters. Many otherkin believe in the existence of a multitude of parallel universes, and their belief in the existence of supernatural or sapient non- human beings is grounded in that idea. Some otherkin consider themselves to be part of the larger \\"Trans\\" identity movement, seeing themselves as \\"trans species\\". With regard to their online communities, otherkin largely function without formal authority structures, and mostly focus on support and information gathering, often dividing into more specific groups based on kintype. There are occasional offline gatherings, but the otherkin network is mostly an online phenomenon. Some otherkin claim to be especially empathic and attuned to nature. Some claim to be able to shapeshift mentally or astrally, meaning that they experience the sense of being in their particular form while not actually changing physically. The therian and vampire subcultures are related to the otherkin community, and are considered part of it by most otherkin, but are culturally and historically distinct movements of their own, despite some overlap in membership. Etymology \\"Otherkin\\" as an adjective was defined in the Middle English Dictionary (1981) as \\"a different or an additional kind of, other kinds of\\". The earliest recorded use of the term otherkin, in the context of a subculture, appeared in July 1990 and the variant otherkind was reported as early as April 1990. The word \\"otherkind\\" was initially coined from the word \\"elfinkind\\", to refer to non-elf others who joined the communities. History The otherkin subculture grew out of the elven online communities of the early-to-mid-1990s. The oldest Internet resource for otherkin is the Elfinkind Digest, a mailing list started in 1990 by a student at the University of Kentucky for \\"elves and interested observers\\". Also in the early 1990s, newsgroups such as alt.horror.werewolves and alt.fan.dragons on Usenet, which were initially created for fans of these creatures in the context of fantasy and horror literature and films, also developed followings of individuals who identified as mythological beings. On 6 February 1995, a document titled the \\"Elven Nation Manifesto\\" was posted to Usenet, including the groups alt.pagan and alt.magick. Enough people contacted the original author of the Elven Nation post in good faith for a planned mailing list to spin off from it. Rich Dansky (who worked on the development of Changeling: The Dreaming) said that after the game's release the darkfae-l listserv had \\"a rampaging debate... over how the folks at White Wolf had gotten so much of their existence right\\", adding, \\"Finally, one of the list members came to the obvious conclusion that we'd gotten it right because we ourselves were in fact changelings.\\" Dansky denied being non-human. Reaction Outside viewers may have varying opinions about people who identify as otherkin, ranging from considering them animal‚Äìhuman relationship pioneers to being psychologically dysfunctional. Reactions often range from disbelief to aggressive antagonism, especially online. Otherkin have been called one of the world's most bizarre subcultures, and a religious movement (and a \\"quasi-religion\\") that \\"in some of its forms, largely only exists on the [Internet]\\".Dawson, Lorne L.; Hennebry, Jenna. \\"New Religions and The Internet: Recruiting in A New Public Space\\". Essay published in several books: * Lori G. Beaman. Religion and Canadian Society: Traditions, Transitions, and Innovations. Canadian Scholars' Press, 2006. * Lorne L. Dawson; Douglas E. Cowan. Religion Online: Finding Faith on the Internet. Routledge, 2004. * Lorne L. Dawson. Cults and New Religious Movements: A Reader. John Wiley & Sons, 2003. Although otherkin beliefs deviate from the definition of \\"religion\\", they share the primary interest in the paranormal. Religion scholar Joseph P. Laycock argues that the otherkin community serves existential and social functions commonly associated with religion, and regards it as an alternative nomos that sustains alternate ontologies.Joseph P. Laycock. ‚ÄúWe Are Spirits of Another Sort‚Äù: Ontological Rebellion and Religious Dimensions of the Otherkin Community. Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions.

H. Arnold High School) is an American high school located in Wiesbaden, Germany, and is a part of the Department of Defense Dependents Schools, the 9th largest United States School System. Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities. History 1940s = Wiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in Frankfurt. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949‚Äì50, the school was named General H.H. Arnold High School after Henry H. Arnold, General of the Army and General of the Air Force during and immediately after World War II. The Berlin Blockade (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students‚Äô parents involved. = 1950s = In January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra√üe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from Rhein Main Air Base and the Darmstadt Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. = 1960s / 1970s = By the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year. = 1980s / 1990s = At the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army dependents, few others were children of DoD civilians or expatriates. After the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the Iron Curtain and Soviet Union, the Cold War effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, Lindsey Air Station, Mainz Army Depot, Lee Barracks, and Camp Pieri. In 1995, following the closure of the Frankfurt American High School, Frankfurt-area students were bused to Wiesbaden, bringing enrollment to around 430 students. = 2000s = Immediately after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, the school heightened its security, erecting fencing and posting armed US soldiers on its perimeter. The campus has remained behind enhanced physical security measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005. In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen. H. H. Arnold High School, is still widely used by tens of thousands of alumni, former faculty and community members. The school's post-Cold War transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army dependents becoming the school's majority and Air Force dependents in the minority. This reality led to a change of the school's JROTC program, which transitioned from Air Force to Army in 2011. Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force JROTC program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe. = 2010s = By 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year- old campus had already begun. Demolition began with the iconic space station- like Dependent Youth Activities (DYA) building, whose futuristic profile stood prominently next to the football field. It was a recreational facility that provided a lunchtime hangout and alternative eatery to the cafeteria. From 2011 to 2014, select buildings were eliminated and added, ushering the new gym, a specialized curriculum building, and multi-purpose building. By summer of 2017, the three-story main building was completed, making Wiesbaden High School the first 21st century-designed High School in DoDEA-Europe. The graduating class of 2018 was the first to graduate using the fully-completed facility. In 2019, the school was home to approximately 490 students, a mixture of American civilian, military, and international students. Extracurricular activities Sports activities include Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Football, Golf, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Track, Volleyball, Wrestling, and Air Rifle Team.

H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore. Protecting the school crest was a custom for nearly half a century. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, it was generally unethical for underclassmen to walk on the crest. It was the responsibility of the presiding senior class to enforce this custom. Mythology explains 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if walked upon the spirit would turn over in its grave. This was considered bad luck and could be tied to misfortunes such as lost football games. During some years, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest. In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \\"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\\" The crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer in the late 1950s, and has been featured in the school's yearbooks since 1959. It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with headdress and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School). The entire inlay (with border frame) is approximately 4' x 5'. The crest was carefully removed during the 2010-2017 campus transformation. The crest has been prominently displayed in the school's new facilities since 2017. Graduating in the Kurhaus is a special honor for those who earn a diploma from this school. Graduates have had the privilege of celebrating their milestone within the Kurhaus' palace- like splendor almost as long as the school has existed. The homecoming Bonfire was an anticipated feature of homecoming weekends, thought to recharge the spirit of the Warriors' teams. The well-attended spectacle made an impression upon author, Larry Collins, who included a description of the event in his 1989 fictional spy novel, Maze. The school colors are royal blue and gold. They were adopted from Wiesbaden's city flag when the school was established in 1948. It has been a tradition to wear the colors on Fridays and for special events.

In the film, Priscilla, played by actress Susan Walters, walks past the \\"General H. H. Arnold High School\\" sign as she departs school grounds. The four-hour Emmy-nominated film is an adaptation of Priscilla's autobiography of the same title. * General H. H. Arnold High School is prominently featured in Larry Collins' 1989 fictional Cold War spy thriller, Maze. Several pages detail student interactions and traditional events at the school. The novel describes the school's annual homecoming bonfire, on a Friday night before the football team plays rival Frankfurt High School. Warrior cheerleaders lead the spirited event for a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators. The school's most significant moment in the story is when a car bomb is detonated in the school's parking lot, leveling half of the gym. The terrorist attack at the school puts the nation on edge, adding fuel to the existing tensions between Washington and Moscow. The school is referred to 13 times by the names: General H. H. Arnold High School, General Arnold High School, Arnold High School, (the) armed forces high school, (the) high school, and (the) military school. There are four mentions of the school's mascot, applying the descriptors Warrior or Warriors. * In Mayte Garcia's New York Times Bestselling memoir, The Most Beautiful: My Life With Prince, the school is mentioned by its original name, General H. H. Arnold High School, on four occasions. Mayte shares some of her experiences at the school, including mentions of homecoming, two proms, and her sword dance performance in the '89/'90 student talent show. Her performance in the school's talent show was video taped by her father and later viewed by Prince to showcase her world-class belly dancing talents.

The area has a population of around 110,000 inhabitants. * Herlev Municipality: Herlev, Hjortespring * Ballerup Municipality: Skovlunde, Ballerup, M√•l√∏v, √Ögerup, Jonstrup, Egebjerg * Egedal Municipality: Sm√∏rumnedre, Stenl√∏se, √òlstykke =The index finger= The index finger forms the western suburbs, which are those with the lowest income per capita and the highest crime rate. The suburbs vary from the petit bourgeois area of Glostrup to the widespread low housing projects of Albertslund and Taastrup. Of the total of 145,000 inhabitants, some 20% are immigrants of first or second generation. * R√∏dovre Municipality: R√∏dovre, Islev * Glostrup Municipality: Glostrup, Hvissinge, Ejby * Br√∏ndby Municipality: Br√∏ndby√∏ster, Br√∏ndbyvester, Br√∏ndby Nord * Albertslund Municipality * H√∏je-Taastrup Municipality: Taastrup, H√∏je-Taastrup, T√•strupg√•rd, Hedehusene =The thumb= The southwest suburbs along the coast form the thumb of the plan. While the central parts of these suburbs are dominated by high-rise housing projects and low-income inhabitants, the distant part is dominated by detached middle-class houses.

It has since been improved and the suburbs on the island hold some 53,000 inhabitants. Amager is now one of the most modern suburbs of Copenhagen with increasing wealth. With the opening of the bridge to Sweden this finger has been extended all the way to Malm√∂. * T√•rnby Municipality: T√•rnby, Kastrup * Drag√∏r Municipality  The sixth finger ‚Äì background  The development of the √òrestad area (the sixth finger) was made by following, in some extent, the concepts of the original finger plan which had as its structure the regional rail system. This model is possible to be linked with the concept of transport oriented development (TOD), in which urban growth areas were developed along five radial corridors that connect Copenhagen inner city with new sub-urban settlements. These new urbanization rapidly attracted residents who came from Copenhagen city looking for more affordable housing options. As a consequence of this displacement of residents out of the city, the Municipality tax base was near to collapse and its economic situation worsened over the time. The two projects in √òrestad were linked in order to achieve the strategic vision of becoming a major economic pole in the Scandinavia region. At the same time it would accommodate urban growth in this area along the new metro rail in a strategic position. Its location is probably the most important characteristic and strength of this project because of its proximity to Copenhagen historic city centre and airport. It is also located in the midpoint area between the √òresund Link which connects Malm√∂ and Copenhagen, this condition allows that the project could receive commuter flows from both cities, generating therefore a double-city link that reinforces regional competitiveness.  The √òrestad model  The idea of this model was established when the √òrestad development corporation (ODC) was created under the √òrestad Act in 1992. The ODC was conceived as a partnership formed by the municipality and the government which owned the land in 55% and 45% respectively by that time. This hybrid corporation (public- public state) had as mission to develop the master plan for √òrestad as well as the construction of the Copenhagen Metro and the land sale, this with the purpose of attracting local and international investors with a new and modern image. The financial model was based on the idea that the sale of plots in this area together with future revenues from ticket sales would finance the Metro construction, therefore the initial government investment will be recovered within 30 years. Along with the idea that connectivity improvement will increase the land value, was also necessary to design an attractive master plan which defines the uses and activities in the area in order to grant the special characteristics to strengthen the project in relation to its local competitors such as the Port of Copenhagen.  The master plan  The master plan for √òrestad was defined in 1995 through an international competition. As well as the Finger Plan (1947), it has a TOD project as its backbone‚Äîthe Metro line‚Äîwhich acts as corridor of development through all the area. It also considers a concentration of high density buildings around six train stations, in special offices and services. However the area was designed with a mix of different land uses and activities in order to make it more attractive (60% of offices, 20% of housing and 20% of facilities). The master plan organizes development along the north-south axis of the island of Amager inscribed in a rectangular area divided in four districts, which are still under construction. During the first stage of the project it was difficult to attract investments. This situation along with the non-expected high cost of the metro construction created a sense of financial crisis. As a response of this situation the government interfered by relocating important public building into the area such as the Copenhagen concert hall and the University of Copenhagen. Even though the government has interfered in order to enhance the attractiveness of the area some external factors have prevented the expected outcomes of the project because of its strong dependence on market fluctuations. Some of these factors are the international financial crisis and the strong local real estate competition. In spite of this, the project is expected to be finished in 2025 according to the original vision and will accommodate 20,000 inhabitants and about 80,000 workers in the area.

Property and casualty insurance agents sell insurance policies that protect individuals and businesses from financial loss resulting from automobile accidents, fire, theft, storms, and other events that can damage property. For businesses, property and casualty insurance can also cover injured Workers Compensation Insurance, product liability claims, or medical malpractice claims. Independent insurance agents typically represent a number of insurance companies, or \\"carriers\\", and sell the products that most appropriately meet the needs of their clients. Independent agents typically are very well trained and knowledgeable of the complexities of the insurance market and insurance law.Princeton Review, \\"Insurance Agent/Broker\\" Their expertise allows them to advise their clients about appropriate amounts of insurance and insurance coverages for their particular needs. Often, independent insurance agents will work with insurance intermediaries, who obtain quotes from multiple insurance providers and pass them off to the independent agent. Working with an insurance intermediary service allows the independent agent to review many quotes and offer their clients the best policy options available. For their efforts, independent agents are paid a commission (remuneration).U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition In addition to insurance policies, agents often sell mutual funds, annuities, and products that address wealth management, retirement and estate planning. Independent agents must be licensed by the states in which they sell insurance and financial products. There are a number of major trade organizations that support the interests and needs of the independent insurance agent, including Agents For Change,http://www.agents4change.net The National Organization of Life and Health Agents (NOLHA),National Organization of Life and Health Agents (NOLHA) the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America (The Big \\"I\\"),Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America and the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents (PIA).Professional Insurance Agents Independent agents are independent contractors for the insurance companies they represent. Several companies may authorize the agent to sell for them, but the agent remains an independent businessperson. While the agent collects commissions, they do not collect a salary from the companies they represent. On average, independent agents work with thirteen property and casualty and six life and health insurance companies on a regular basis.National Alliance Research Academy, Independent agents own and control their accounts, policy records, and renewals. If an independent agent‚Äôs contract with a particular insurance company terminates, the agent retains the rights to active accounts and may place them with another insurer. Competition exists between exclusive agents and independent agents. Exclusive agents, who are salaried employees of the insurance company, write a majority of the personal lines business.American Risk and Insurance Association However, because of the complexities involved in commercial risks, independent agents capture approximately 80 percent of the commercial lines market.American Agent & Broker It is having access to multiple markets that gives independent agents a competitive advantage in commercial lines. To add to an independent agent‚Äôs competition pool, many insurance companies are direct competitors to the agents they appoint. For example, Progressive Insurance spends nearly $300 million a year in advertising directly to the public. Yet, Progressive is the country‚Äôs largest writer of private passenger auto insurance through the independent agent distribution channel.http://newsroom.progressive.com/2003/September/Applied-award.aspx  References External links *Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America *National Organization of Life and Health Agents (NOLHA) Category:Insurance ","title":"Independent insurance agent"},{"id":"21702231","text":"Stoutsburg is an unincorporated community located along the border of Hopewell Township in Mercer County and Montgomery Township in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States.Locality Search, State of New Jersey.

XBRL GL is developed by the XBRL GL Working Group of XBRL International. XBRL GL can be used by Computer programs for information interchange of accounting General ledger balances (summarized information) as well as complete accounting ledgers (payables, receivables, inventory, payroll, order entry, purchasing, banking) supporting object oriented accounting, quantity accounting and transparency support. The instance documents (XML files) can also be viewed in Web browsers using XSL or programmatically; it can also be carried in Inline XBRL. XBRL is designed to standardize the data, processes and rules of Business Reporting as a whole, although most implementations focus on financial reporting. XBRL GL can support the detail and integrate to all manners of reporting, financial, tax, sustainability, statistics and otherwise, and carry both quantitative and qualitative information. Relation to UN/CEFACT accounting and SIE There are a number of other efforts that seek to standardize parts or all of the data in an ERP system, although most focus on the general ledger. Amongst the competing/complementary efforts in the space are UN/CEFACT, OECD Standard Audit File and SIE (file format) accounting interchange file formats. XBRL GL is an XML focused format. UN/CEFACT is UML (Unified Modeling Language)-based, with standard naming and design rules to convert it to an XML file format. In Sweden the elder (1992) domestically SIE (file format) is a tagged text file format. The XML technology is much better suited to work with modern HTML and WEB-based technology and tools. The XML files are in the range 20-50 times larger than SIE files on the hard disk. Due to the needs of the tax community in many countries, the Standard Audit File is generic, but an example of a proprietary XML format is provided. The XML format abilities (such as validation capabilities) and the huge activities around XBRL and UN/CEFACT have created a huge potential and expectations of modern accounting technologies. XBRL GL is certainly formed from its origins, the audit and financial reporting societies in the USA and globally. UN/CEFACT is working on trade administration theme and accounting is the terminal point of trade administration and its file format is designed from a trade administration point of view. The Standard SIE is designed from a local Swedish vendor society‚Äôs own market interests. All three file formats are however transparent and independent of any charts of accounts and tax regulations.  Accounting information interchange issues - The accounting file standard stand-off Is a common international accounting file format possible? = There has been quite some file format debate. However differences in Chart of accounts between countries, represents a much bigger compatibility problem of information interchange between accounting and financial reports between accounting cultures. Tax regulations also make huge differences in the actual content of accounting and financial report information between countries. The basic issue is if it is possible to transfer accounting data over governmental boundaries and the data would be understood by the receiver? Will it be possible for someone to read a balance sheet with a foreign chart of accounts and understand it? Will it make any difference to transfer it by computer files in standardized file formats? The EU commission has spent large efforts into the field of tax administrative harmonisation and for instance is the main intention latest version of the EU VAT directive to achieve this and to support electronic trade documents like electronic invoices better in cross border trade especially within the European Union Value Added Tax Area. But there is still a huge way to real compatible charts of accounts and international accounting information interchange. One question is if international trade agreements have much value without a global harmonisation in VAT tax administrative legislation between the agreeing parts. The EU- agreements with countries like Norway do not include VAT union membership. And so goods are stuck in customs (to large costs) for VAT declaration and administratively it requires a lot of work. Work and halting not happening within the EU VAT union. With global VAT legislation administrative harmonisation a lot is suddenly possible. =Procurement - Being a standard organisation or not?= Another problem is the EU government procurement regulations in demands of standards organisations specifications, of recognition of the private market efforts from many initiatives being made so far. It actually stops governmental administration to take part, contribute and use the work being done so far. UN/CEFACT is an official UN standards organisation, but UN/CEFACT have big problems finalizing its project and few if any, understand the general idea on how to apply UN/CEFACT accounting, UN/CEFACT(EDIFICAS) being asked can't/don't tell. This is one of the main problems for tax authorities to make demands/providing service for the companies on electronic interchange of data. (A question is how long the world can afford modern procurement?) However XBRL looks for recognition as standards organisation. =The benefit of the data producer?= XBRL has a general problem being designed for the receiving users of information like audits and analysers and it doesn‚Äôt look to be enough really convincing arguments for the information producers (companies doing the actual accounting) to pay for the XBRL GL file producing features in commercial software. And without support of the information producers there will be no data for the analysers and audits in XBRL GL format, and so no market for commercial software for them either. =What defines accounting boundaries and accounting file contents?= Accounting is originally manual work and parts of it has been computerised using accounting commercial software. But a commercial aspect of accounting is its boundaries and what should be included in accounting commercial software feature packages. The accounting work is making accounting vouchers with entries and then check the entries are right. The major checking tools are the bank account statements to and cash (register) lists, to prove that every monetary transaction is accounted for in the accounting. Still this checking is to a large extent manual very labour- intensive work computers do much better. Secondly proving that there are evidences for what the transactions consist of by the voucher documentation. Vouchers that are incoming and outgoing invoices (and receipts), in practice a physical voucher folder. (Still the EU VAT directive and many countries VAT legislation demands keeping physical paper folders of vouchers making scanned vouchers not that smooth to work with. This despite the EU commission has a vision of electronic vouchers. Same legislation makes problems with electronic invoices and integration with accounting. So there are still much to solve.) Another way of looking it are the legal demands and 95% of all legal demands of accounting comes from VAT legislation where the EU VAT directive (European Union value added tax) is the most fully covering documentation. In that perspective it's obvious that invoices and receipts are first and foremost accounting documents (required by the VAT legislation), secondly civil law documents and thirdly they are general trade documents. The accounting documentation required by the VAT legislation is the main regulating law of the entire accounting requirements. To make benefits for the producer of the data it is most likely in this field integration and atomisation features that are worth paying for by the paying customer of commercial software producing accounting information files (like XBRL GL SIE and UN/CEFACT). To do that invoices (with Accounts payables and Accounts receivables) and bank account statements could be considered as accounting documents, and included in a standard file format solution. None of the present file formats do that but would open up the market for third party automation software using AI. The lack of accounting integration is also the most likely reason for electronic invoice formats still having very low market penetration and progress is slow. Mainly because the electronic invoice formats are not in first place designed for accounting and VAT legislation demands, but in unregulated trade document perspectives. Interesting is that there are no standard file formats for bank account statements and it is not (according to the UN/CEFACT banking group TBG5) in the interest of the banks, but for accounting to have, making automatic matching possible with accounting. However an international standard file format for bank account statements would make huge benefits in developing internet banking pages with new features benefitting the bank customers. Especially if integration with a standard invoice (receipt) format would be included. =Applied use instruction set to be understood - making a commercial software market possible= XBRL GL is also without an additional use instruction set, not tight/clear enough in of its file format, still making it very uncertain, in how to use XBRL GL. That a reading party would actually understand what data in an external XBRL GL file, really stands for. The situation is like agreeing on using a common writing alphabet without agreeing on what language to use it for. If someone sends a letter in Portuguese in Latin letters to a Dutchman often the Dutchman do not understand Portuguese, even though he can read Latin letters. We have the same problem here. And with no general solution, agreements between every writing and reading user must be made, and that is not a smooth solution getting volumes and a market for commercial software. An issue SIE as a vendor organisation is able to solve but a standards organisation ethics do not allow UN/CEFACT or XBRL to handle. SIE could be a key player here, supplying an applied instruction layer to XBRL GL (and UN/CEFACT accounting). But at the SIE year meeting 2013 after studying XBRL GL for a year, and a representative of XBRL GL international present at the meeting, the main members argued ‚Äúwho is the paying customer?‚Äù and the project of making a SIE XBRL GL implementation ran into the sand. There are a number of articles in the branch would press about very expensive XBRL projects with very sparse results of volume use. The contradiction between standards organisation ethics and applied technology (a common implementation instruction set) issues, is a hard thing to solve to make such projects more successful. In 1992, SIE solved the issue for the SIE (file format) as a non-standards organisation vendor society. All members but one large vendor, agreed to a common implementation, including an implementation instruction set, and made it available for all vendors in the market. All other (national, future and international) vendors in the domestic Swedish accounting related commercial software market had to, by customer demand, follow the standard to sell any volumes. Actually the existence of the common format showed the market very good arguments for the data producing users real strong benefits. especially the daily interaction between the company, accounting consultant and audit, being very rational and benefitted in possible daily information feedback. Benefits and features are almost impossible to convince paying customers before the features are actually available, and this is a huge commercial problem for XBRL GL and UN/CEFACT to solve, not being a vendor interest group society. It is interesting to note that the starting vision of SIE was about the same as XBRL, export accounting data to tax declaration commercial software. But it is possible to find special benefit points data for producers, and by it make them pay to get the features of the accounting standard file format, but it is a hard commercial design issue. There is a general stand-off situation in this market field. And how XBRL will solve it, is the major future question. XBRL International's Global Ledger Taxonomy Framework XBRL GL, the familiar name for XBRL International's Global Ledger Taxonomy Framework, is a series of modular taxonomies developed by XBRL International and a framework for its extension for representing the information found in a typical Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system using XML and the XBRL Specification.  Formal models and XBRL GL  XBRL GL is the modeling of the semantics of information found in ERP systems using the XBRL Specification. Additional efforts to reuse the semantic of the Global Ledger using other syntaxes are also being explored.  Tax organization interest in XBRL GL  XBRL GL was designed to be generic and holistic, and serve as a bridge between transaction space and reporting. As such it has gained interest from many sectors, including tax administrators in OASIS (organization) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). XBRL GL has been adopted by the Turkish government for the standard for electronic bookkeeping for tax purposes. XBRL GL uniquely can track and reconcile the book-tax differences found in direct taxation regimes, including permanent and timing differences.

Its fossils have been found in Upper Jurassic rocks in Portugal. Miragaia has the longest neck known for any stegosaurian, which included at least seventeen vertebrae.  Discovery  One of the seventeen neck vertebrae, seen from the right upper side Miragaia is based on holotype ML 433, a nearly complete anterior half of a skeleton with partial skull (the first cranial material for a European stegosaurid). The remains were found after the construction of a road between the villages of Miragaia and Sobral. The rear half of the skeleton was probably destroyed by the roadcut. The fossils were dug up in August 1999 and August 2001. Among the recovered bones were most of the snout, a right postorbital, both angulars of the lower jaws, fifteen neck vertebrae (the first two, which articulated with the skull, were absent), two anterior dorsal vertebrae, twelve ribs, a chevron, the shoulder bones, most of the forelimbs including a possible os carpi intermedium, a right first metacarpal and three first phalanges; and thirteen bony plates plus a spike. The bones were not articulated but dispersed over a surface of about five to seven metres, though there was a partial concentration of fossils that could be salvaged within a single block. ML 433 was found in the Miragaia Unit of the Sobral Unit, Lourinh√£ Formation, which dates to the late Kimmeridgian-early Tithonian (Late Jurassic, approximately 150 million years ago). Oct√°vio Mateus, Susannah Maidment and Nicolai Christiansen named and briefly described Miragaia in 2009. The type species is Miragaia longicollum. The generic name refers to the village of Miragaia but also is an allusion to mira, \\"wonderful\\" in Latin, and Gaia, the Earth Goddess. The specific name means \\"long neck\\" from the Latin longus, \\"long\\" and collum, \\"neck\\". A partial pelvis (ilium and pubic bone) and two partial dorsal vertebrae from a juvenile individual (specimen ML 433-A) were found at the same location, intermingled with the bones of the holotype, and were also assigned, as a paratype, to M. longicollum. Casts were made of the holotype bones and partially based on these a life-size skeletal model was constructed from polyurethane and polyester resin parts. In 2010, Alberto Cobos et al. noted that all the diagnostic characters of Miragaia longicollum are based on skeletal elements that are absent in the Dacentrurus holotype found in England in layers of about the same age, while all traits that can be compared are shared by both genera. Cobos et al. therefore proposed that Miragaia is a junior synonym of Dacentrurus, meaning that it is the same dinosaur, because it is not possible to differentiate the two taxa through their holotypes. However, Francisco Costa and Mateus in 2019 affirmed the validity of Miragaia longicollum, describing a newly recognised specimen, MG 4863, that had already been excavated in 1959 by Georges Zbyszewski but was only prepared between 2015 and 2017. It consists of a skeleton that also contains tail vertebrae, the most complete dinosaur ever found in Portugal. They renamed Alcovasaurus into a second species: Miragaia longispinus. DescriptionSize and diagnosis= Size comparison The total length of Miragaia has been estimated at 5.5 ‚Äì 6 metres (18‚Äì20 ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 6.5 metres, the weight at two tonnes. Histology shows that the holotype specimen was about 21 years old. The describers established six distinguishing traits. At their very midline, the praemaxillae meet in a small sharp point, set within a larger notch in the snout tip as a whole. The front lower side edge of the praemaxilla protrudes to below. At least seventeen cervical vertebrae are present. The neural spines of the middle cervical vertebrae have a notch at their lower front edge with immediately above it a process directed to the front. The vertebrae of the middle neck, rear neck and front back possess neural spines that have a transversely expanded upper end. On the neck two rows of triangular bony plates are present that have a lightly convex outer side and a notch at the upper front edge creating a hook. =Neck elongation= Restoration The most notable feature of Miragaia is its long neck, which was composed of at least seventeen vertebrae. According to the authors, this represents the culmination of a trend towards longer necks seen in stegosaurians. The Thyreophora, the larger group they belong to, originally seem to have had nine neck vertebrae and this is also the number shown by the basal stegosaurian Huayangosaurus. Later forms like Stegosaurus or Hesperosaurus had twelve or thirteen. Remarkably Miragaia had more neck vertebrae than most sauropods, a different group of dinosaurs famous for their long necks, which contrasts with the traditional view of stegosaurians as low browsers with short necks. Only the Chinese sauropods Euhelopus, Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus had as many neck vertebrae as Miragaia, with most sauropods of the Late Jurassic possessing only twelve to fifteen. Mateus and colleagues suggested that the long neck either allowed Miragaia to browse at a level that other herbivores were not exploiting, or that the neck arose due to sexual selection. The possible food gathering function of the neck makes sexual selection a less plausible explanation, but is not in itself entirely convincing: though the contemporary Iberian sauropods Lusotitan, Dinheirosaurus and Turiasaurus were all very large and might not have competed with a medium-height browser, the niche partitioning is still problematic because in Iberia stegosaurian remains have been referred to Dacentrurus and Stegosaurus, which would have possessed a feeding envelope or feeding height stratification overlapping that of Miragaia. In sauropods, great neck length was achieved by a combination of three processes: incorporation of back vertebrae into the neck; addition of new vertebrae; and lengthening of the individual neck vertebrae. The authors considered whether these mechanisms might have been paralleled in stegosaurians. The long neck of Miragaia appears to have resulted mostly from back vertebrae becoming incorporated into the neck, based on vertebral counts of other stegosaurians. In this group the total number of prescral vertebrae, of the back and neck combined, hardly increased, but there is a clear transformation, dorsal vertebrae of the back becoming \\"cervicalised\\" into cervical vertebrae of the neck. Whereas Huayangosaurus still possessed sixteen back vertebrae, this number was reduced to thirteen in Hesperosaurus. There is currently ‚Äî no count of the number of dorsal vertebrae being possible ‚Äî no evidence that with Miragaia new vertebrae contributed to the neck; instead, the distribution of existing vertebrae in the back and neck probably changed, about four extra vertebrae becoming cervicals. There is some evidence for increasing vertebral length in Miragaia and Stegosaurus, compared to more basal species, but this is equivocal and could be due to post-mortem distortion; this mechanism was seen as a minor factor in neck elongation. The authors also discussed the possible underlying genetic mechanisms for such changes. They pointed out that, in contrast with mammals which almost always have seven neck vertebrae due to as much as four hox-genes ensuring a strict partitioning between neck and back, in extant dinosaurs such as the chicken only a single hox-gene regulates this process, seemingly leading to greater evolutionary plasticity. =Skeleton= The right humerus, with the arrow indicating the deltopectoral crest Apart from the neck length, the known osteology of Miragaia resembles that of other stegosaurids, differing in small details. The tip of the beak was toothless, as in Stegosaurus. The upper beak, formed by the praemaxilla, was pendant. The notch in the snout tip was, seen from above, shaped like a W, whereas in Stegosaurus the notch is U-shaped, with a little bulbous projection in the middle. The upper surface of the nasal bone was ornamented. A ridge formed the contact with the maxilla. The maxilla had sixteen teeth. The postorbital was a small and triradiate element. The cervical vertebrae had well-developed cervical ribs, fused to the vertebral body. The ribs were elongated, with a forward-pointing process on the capitulum, the main rib head. The neural spines of the rear cervicals and front dorsals are transversely expanded at their upper ends due to rugosities serving as an attachment for tendons. This expanded sector projects to the front also, creating a notch on the lower front edge. Additionally the neural spine base is transversely constricted. Ridges extend to the rear from the sides of the neural spine base, over the upper sides of the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses. These postzygapophyses themselves project far beyond the rear facet of the vertebral body, a derived trait. The prezygapophyses to the contrary, are much shorter; they have a notch at the front upper edge. The scapula had a large rectangular acromion, with a sharp upper corner, on the lower front edge. The more narrow coracoid had a rounded lower edge. Both the upper arm and ulna and radius (lower arm bones) are also comparable to those of Stegosaurus. The tuberosity of the rear humerus serving as attachment for the musculus triceps brachii is well-developed but the vertical ridge running from it to below is not. In the pelvis, the pubic bone had a deep front part, the processus praepubicus, with a little upward projecting process as seen in Dacentrurus; the rear shaft had a lightly expanded tip. =Osteoderms= Miragaia, like all known stegosaurians, showed an array of plates and spikes, consisting of skin ossifications or osteoderms. Paired triangular plates ran down the midline of the neck, reconstructed as eight pairs. They were asymmetrical with a convex outer side and a concave inner side. Their bases were not very expanded with the exception of a possible last pair, located on the front back. They were obtuse but lightly hooked at the front. A rather long, narrow and straight preserved spike was at first considered to have been a shoulder spine, but was later seen as part of some tail arrangement. Phylogeny Miragaia was placed in the Stegosauridae in 2009. Mateus and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis and found Miragaia to group with Dacentrurus in a clade Dacentrurinae, newly named for the occasion, the sister group to Stegosaurus (the latter genus was in the cladistic analysis considered to include Hesperosaurus and Wuerhosaurus). The position of Miragaia in the stegosaurid evolutionary tree is shown by this cladogram: The authors stressed that the only synapomorphy, shared derived trait, supporting the Dacentrurus-Stegosaurus clade was the possession of the long cervical postzygapophyses, and that these are in fact unknown for Dacentrurus itself, so that its close position to Stegosaurus was merely based on the new data provided by the description of Miragaia.

The YMCA of the North Shore has owned and operated a children's day camp on it since 1955. The first written record of the island was in 1655 when it was granted to Governor John Endecott. It was then bought and sold several times until around the Revolutionary War when the Essex hospital was built as a smallpox inoculation site. The hospital was burned down by townspeople of Marblehead. By the end of the 19th century, the Lowell island house was established as a summer resort. This was run for about 30 years before being converted into a sanitarium for sick and crippled children until 1946. The island then lay unused until bought by the YMCA and converted into a day camp. Name The island has had numerous names including Catta, Cotta, Catt, Cat, Lowell, Pollard, and Children's; for most of history it was Cat Island. Speculation about the origin of its name is that in the 18th century Catta was a corruption of Cotta and referred to an early Marblehead native named Robert Cotta. However, no evidence links Mr. Cotta to the island in any way, as discussed extensively in \\"Field Meeting at Lowell Island.\\"Field Meeting at Lowell Island in Bulletin of the Essex Institute. Vol. 12. 1880. The island's name was officially changed from Cat Island to Children's Island by petition of the Marblehead/Swampscott YMCA in 1996. HistoryColonial Times= Written reference to Children's Island first appeared in 1655 when \\"...the iland called Catta Iland...lying neere to Marble Head [sic]...\\"Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, Vol III, p.389 was granted to Governor John Endecott at his own request by the General Court of Massachusetts. Prior to 1655, it is likely that this and other local islands served as a source of smooth rocks for ship ballast, as a site for grazing animals, and as a source of timber for ship building. In June 1629, Reverend Francis Higginson notes \\"we passed the curious and difficult entrance into the large and spacious harbour of Naimkecke, [Salem] and as we passed along it was wonderful to behould so many islands replenished with thicke woods and high trees and many fayre green pastures [sic].\\"Hutchinson's Collection of Papers, p44 Although not specifically named by Higginson, Children's Island is presumably one of these wooded islands. Upon the Governor's death in 1665 he gave to his wife \\"Catta Island, at Salem, which the Generall Court gave mee, during her life, & after her decease to my two sons, John & Zerobabel or to the longest liver of them.[sic]\\" In 1684, according to Zerubbabel's will \\"Cotta Island or any other land belonging to me which I have not otherwise bequeathed\\" was left to his five daughters. With the help of their brother Samuel, they \\"assign[ed] all that his Island...lying and being in ye Tounship of Marblehead commonly called and knoune by ye name of Catt Iland graunted to ye late worship John Endicott Esq [sic]....\\" to Richard Reade of Marblehead in March, 1687 for 16 pounds. How or why the name changed from Catta, to Cotta, and then to Catt Island is unexplained. The Reade family had financial difficulties and used the Island as a source of collateral for multiple loans. In February, 1738 the first reference to a house on the island is made when the Reades used it as collateral for a loan: \\"... Catt Island together with the house and woods thereon,\\"Southern Essex District Registry of Deeds, vol 78, p.121 though who built it and when is not known. In 1746, Samuel Reade received 75 pounds for \\"all one half of that island called and known by the name of Catt Island lying in the harbour of Marblehead with one half of the house thereon\\"Southern Essex District Registry of Deeds, book 78, p.121 from John Oliver. Finally, in 1761 due to an unsatisfied mortgage, Children's Island (Catt Island) was given up to the Wait family of Marblehead in whose possession it remained until 1773.Searle, Richard W. History of Catta Iland Off Marblehead in The Essex Institute Historical Collections. Vol. LXXXIII, Oct. 1947 On September 2, 1773, the Island was sold to four prominent men from MarbleheadSouthern Essex District Registry of Deeds, book 138, p178 with the plan to build a smallpox hospital. =Essex Hospital= In June 1773, Marblehead was stricken by an epidemic of smallpox. Although some in the medical community argued in favor of inoculation of the disease, most people at the time were terrified of and vehemently opposed to the practice. In August 1773, a Marblehead town meeting was held to debate the construction of a public inoculation hospital on one of the nearby islands. The proposal was rejected, but the majority did agree to allow a private funding of a hospital as long as the Marblehead selectmen could regulate it.Smith, Philip Chadwick Foster, ed. The Journals of Ashley Bowen (1728-1813) of Marblehead. 1973. Vol.II The owners of the future Essex Hospital were four popular Marblehead political figures: John Glover, Jonathan Glover (John Glover's brother), Azor Orne, and Elbridge Gerry; they purchased Children's Island (Catt Island) on September 2, 1773, although the idea remained contentious. By early October, the hospital and a shifting-house were completed, and Dr. Hall Jackson from Portsmouth was hired as hospital superintendent, and Dr. Ananias Randall from Long Island as assistant physician.Hall Jackson and the Purple Foxglove, p. 26 On October 19, the first group of patients arrived at the hospital and were inoculated, and since they were contagious after inoculation, remained on the island until November 9‚Äì11. On November 15, the second group of patients, numbering around 100, was inoculated at Essex Hospital, while the third group of patients was inoculated at the hospital in December 1773. In early January 1774, a boatload of this third class attempted to land at Nick‚Äôs Cove, an unsanctioned landing area in Marblehead.Essex Gazette, January 11‚Äì18, 1774. Many townspeople were upset and a period of disorder and riots ensued. A few weeks later, four townsmen were caught stealing contaminated clothing from the island while attempting to smuggle them into Marblehead. Presumably, they were hoping to earn condemnation for the hospital by starting an outbreak of smallpox. The following morning, the four were tarred and feathered and paraded through Marblehead into Salem, a source of much entertainment to those witnessing the spectacle.Essex Gazette, January 18‚Äì25, 1774 Due to ongoing opposition, the hospital proprietors called for a town meeting on January 24 to ask the town to purchase the hospital and supplies, and to decide if the hospital should be kept open. Alternatively, they requested that if the hospital be closed that \\"a committee to cleanse the furniture, etc. in the so just and most satisfactory manner to the Town\\" be formed. The town refused to buy the hospital and supplies but did form a committee to oversee disinfection. On the following day, the three committee members and eight members of their family spent the next two days on the island cleaning and disinfecting, when on the second night they were suddenly awakened by fire. During the night, approximately 20 townspeople had sneaked onto the island and set the hospital on fire. Everyone escaped alive but all buildings and property were burned or destroyed.Essex Gazette, January 25 ‚Äì February 1, 1774 The owners sued for damages, but those events were quickly forgotten as thoughts turned toward revolution. =The Revolutionary War and War of 1812= As one of the Intolerable Acts issued by the British in response to the Boston Tea Party, The Boston Port Act closed Boston Harbor on June 1, 1774. Subsequently, much of the ship traffic designated for Boston was diverted to Marblehead and Salem Harbors. Starting in late December, 1774 and for the next seven months British war ships, mostly HMS Fowey, HMS Lively, and HMS Merlin blockaded Marblehead and Salem Harbors. Children‚Äôs Island (at that time still known as Cat Island) served as a common anchorage site for these big ships, whose crews must have embarked on the island at times for ballast stones, wood, and water: \\"Captain [George] Montagu of the Fowey ... had moved from Cat Island to Bakers Island for water, which fell short at the former place ...\\" in January, 1776.Narrative of Vice Admiral Samuel Graves in Naval Documents of the American Revolution, vol 3 1775-1776, p1006 In December 1775, three British ships paraded around Children's Island in war formation threatening to bombard Marblehead. After spending half a day in threatening display, they left without attacking. Most likely hemmed in by the rocky shores of Children's Island and the fort at Gale‚Äôs Head (later known as Fort Sewall), the British surmised they were easy targets. On Monday, January 8, 1776, Ashley Bowen notes: \\"I find the Fowey's people have cut down all the trees from Cat Island.\\" However, the Marblehead Register, a local newspaper of the time, has an entry of Dr. Story on January 7, 1776, \\"Trees on Cat Island cut down last night, suppose by the Merlin.\\" Another reference notes: \\"1776, January 8 ‚Äì The Merlin cut down the trees on Cat Island ‚Äì so we hear no more of the Merlin. There was a clump of trees on the middle of the Island ‚Äì the most conspicuous landmark on the coast.\\" However, Ashley Bowen who documents on the happenings of Marblehead daily notes on August 16, 1775 \\"sailed the Merlin ... for Boston. As the Merlin passed Point of [the] Neck she fired a shot over the neck,\\" and he does not indicate that the Merlin returns to the Marblehead area any time near January 1776. In addition, after the tree-cutting episode Bowen continues to record the actions of the Fowey and makes no mention of the Merlin; therefore, most likely it was the men of the Fowey and not the Merlin who cut down the trees. The amount of trees cut and the purpose of cutting them is not mentioned, though perhaps it allowed a better view of Marblehead Harbor to prevent the rebels (soon to be Americans) from escaping. Alternatively the lumber could have been used as fuel, though no mention of cutting wood on nearby more heavily wooded islands is mentioned. The owners of the former Essex Hospital held the Island throughout the war. Sometime before 1787 both Glovers sold their quarter ownerships to Deacon William Williams of Marblehead. The Deacon then acquired another 16th part to gain majority ownership. After his death in 1787, his wife sold the property to Edward Fettyplace for $43.33 on June 25, 1795. Some observations and events concerning the island occurred around this time. On August 18, 1791 Reverend William Bentley recorded the following in his diary: The Reverend documented another trip to the Island in his diary on June 24, 1803: \\"... fished between grey rock & Cat Island, & as the wind was rising landed on Cat Island. Here we spent the day. The wind was so high that no tent could stand, & we were exposed to the sun without any shelter, & the heat was excessive. We could find no spring & the well was dry. We found three horses & good grass. In the evening we returned.\\" A continuing problem was shipwrecks against the many rocks and islands surrounding Marblehead Harbor. At the time there were no marine markers, and identifying hazards was difficult especially to those unfamiliar with the area. A temporary solution was to plant trees as landmarks onto large rocks, and using these as a reference points on charts and written navigational directions. As the Reverend notes in his diary on July 23, 1806: \\"Marblehead will petition for Marblehead rock, eastern rock of Cat Island, & Tinker‚Äôs & Ram island. He says the complaint of want of land marks is universal. He has planted a poplar on Marblehead rock having found a depth of soil in a spot of 5 feet. Eastern rock of Cat Island admits trees also & three have been planted\\"The Diary of William Bentley. Volume 3. p241 and again on Jan 29, 1807: \\"the Town have had a meeting upon the subject of the petition to the General Court from Marblehead to grant to their marine Society the Islands laying off that Town ... They ask for E. Rock of Cat Island, Marblehead rock, Tinker‚Äôs & Ram island, as Capt. prince informed me.\\"The Diary of William Bentley. Volume 3. p274 The Marblehead Marine Society was formed in 1798 \\"for the laudable purposes of promoting the knowledge of Navigation & Seamanship, of giving relief to decayed & disabled Seamen & to the indigent Widows and Orphans of deceased Seamen & of others who may be Members of said Society.\\"Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts. 1798-99. Chapter 44. p 53 Mention of a landmark at these locations is made in the 1817th edition of The American Coast Pilot: \\"The Marblehead Marine Society has erected on Cat island rock, a spar 40 feet high, to the top of which is annexed a cask of about 130 gallons measure, which is seen at sea 20 or 30 feet above the land\\"Blunt, Edmund. The American Coast Pilot. 9th Edition. 1817. p131 A date of 1808 is engraved into the rock at the top of Cormorant Rock, as the East Rock of Cat Island is now known, but no other evidence of a structure exists. This is the likely date and location of the spar described. No mention of marker is made in the 1806 (5th) edition of the American Coast Pilot, which implies the spar was placed between 1800 and 1817. In January 1822 the General Court of Massachusetts ceded a part of Tinker‚Äôs Island, Marblehead Rock, and \\"also the East Rock of Cat Island\\" to the United States \\"for the purpose of erecting and preserving land marks thereon...\\" A popular local myth is that Children's Island provided shelter to USS Constitution during the War of 1812. In fact, Fort Sewall and the difficulties in navigating into Marblehead Harbor were crucial in protecting Old Ironsides. In April 1814 USS Constitution had been chased by HMS Tenedos and HMS Endymion for three days. To outrun these ships, the crew of Constitution jettisoned her provisions, water, and ‚Äúevery thing movable.‚Äù.American Naval Battles. 1837. p218 About three miles (5 km) off Fort Sewall, she was piloted into Marblehead Harbor by Samuel Green, a Marblehead native.Roads, Samuel. The History and Traditions of Marblehead. 1881. p250 The British were hesitant to follow, not wanting to venture too close to the protection of Fort Sewall and risk navigation through the unfamiliar channel. Gradually and by 1816, the Fettyplace family acquired full ownership to Children's (Cat) Island, which they sold in 1846 to John Roundy of Marblehead. In February, 1848, Roundy sold the island ‚Äúwith all the buildings thereon‚Äù to Nathaniel Blaney of Marblehead. A year later, Nathaniel sold the property to David Blaney also of Marblehead. =Lowell Island House= Summary. For full article, see Lowell island house In 1850, the Salem and Lowell Railroad Company opened, and in competition with the Boston and Lowell Railroad hoped to increase passenger travel. The owners decided to create a seaside resort near Salem and purchased Children's Island (Cat Island) from David Blaney for $1000. In August 1851, the first trip to the newly named Lowell Island was a huge success. Flush with this success, the owner's built a hotel on the Northwest section of the island which opened on June 15, 1852, and \\"contain[ed] a number of public and private parlors, one hundred sleeping rooms, and a dining hall which will seat two hundred and fifty persons.

Mr. Johnson ran the hotel for the next three years but was not successful. In 1871 he sold the property, and over the next six years the property was bought and sold several times before being sold to Samuel B. Rindge for $4500 in January, 1878.

At any rate, it is clear that Mr. Fredrick Rindge did donate the Island, buildings, and $1000 to develop what became known as the Children's Island Sanitarium. In the late 19th century, \\"sea air [was] looked upon as almost a panacea for that class of disorders of nutrition which is shown in the disorders of joints and bones,...(and) in adopting the sea coast plan for their Institute the managers of the Lowell Island Sanitorium...hope that the beneficial effect of sea air would be especially manifest in children suffering from chronic malnutrition, a belief which is entertained by all medical authorities.\\".An Island Sanatorium for Children in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal. July 22, 1886. p 68. On July 11, 1886 the Children's Island Sanitarium was opened for nearly two months and hosted a total of 150 children \\"exposed to the summer diseases of crowded cities, or to children...troubled by the affliction popularly called 'rickets'.\\" Despite the belief that the Children's Island Sanitarium was a tuberculosis sanitarium, no child with a contagious disease, especially active tuberculosis, was admitted. Joint and bone infections (osteomyelitis), both TB and non-TB, are not contagious and these children were admitted. Many other children who were there suffered deformities from rickets or vitamin D deficiency. One persistent problem of the Island is the lack of fresh water: HMS Fowey apparently left the island to look for fresh water on Baker's Island in 1776, and some claimed \\"the hotel had been a failure because there was not enough water on the island for its numerous guests.\\"Louise, Sister Catherine. The House of My Pilgrimage. History of the American House of the Society of St. Margaret 1873-1973. p52. Water from the island was also on the mind of the Board of Managers of the Sanitarium, and they submitted a well water sample from the island to the Massachusetts Board of Health for testing on September 10, 1907. The test results \\"show that the water is very hard, has a disagreeable odor and contains an excessive quantity of organic matter. It is unfit for drinking, and the Board would recommend that the further use of this source be prevented.\\"Marblehead (Children‚Äôs Island Sanitarium) in 39th Annual Report of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts. 1908. p71. A large financial supporter of the Children‚Äôs Island Sanitarium, the Boston Community Fund, withdrew support necessitating the closure of the Sanitarium. In 1946, the trustees voted \\"not to use Children‚Äôs Island for the purposes for which this corporation is organized after November 1, 1946; and to surrender possession therof on that date to the heirs and assigns of Frederick H.

The following year the YMCA purchased the island with money contributed by four YMCA directors. A new pier was constructed, and two foundations converted into swimming pools. In the 1960s, the sailors and arts and crafts building were constructed. In June 1971, 60 Army Reserve engineers completed a $40,000 repair project filling in open holes, stabilizing the swimming pool, and repaired retention walls.Marines landed - for Y campers.

Marblehead Magazine. https://www.legendinc.com/Pages/MarbleheadNet/MM/Articles/CatIslandHistory.html Children are picked up from a dock on State Street in Marblehead (and more recently Pickering Wharf in Salem) and are returned at the end of the day. Activities at camp have included sailing, archery, swimming, riflery (formerly), nature, arts & crafts, fishing, and one or more overnights a session. A \\"Rangers\\" Program modeled after the Boy Scouts was created in the 1960s by Peter Sawin and has always been extremely popular. During the \\"Perfect Storm\\" of 1991, the island sustained significant damage, and the pier was nearly destroyed. It was moved from its central position on the island to a location on the southwest side. However, this was more open to the wind and waves and was moved back to the original location a few years later. In the 1990s, multiple new buildings were constructed including the Ranger's Lodge, Gazebo, and a combination office and infirmary. Although known as Children's Island since the days of the sanitarium in the early 1900s, its name was officially changed from Cat Island to Children's Island by petition of the Marblehead/Swampscott YMCA in 1996.

The painting was being referred to as La Schiavona before the beginning of the seventeenth century. However, this name is traditional, given to the painting by someone in recognition of the style of her dress and her physiognomy. In reality, the lady portrayed would have been part of the nobility of the time, with a costume compatible with that of the wealthy women of the territories controlled by the Republic of Venice. Some people have tried to identify the woman as Catherine Cornaro, a hypothesis without any confirmation. Previously assigned to Giorgione, the painting is today commonly accepted as a youthful masterpiece by Titian; further evidence is provided by the absence of the modulated sweetness of the painter from Castelfranco Veneto, replaced rather by a pulsating vitality. There are also close similarities with the woman protagonist of the Miracolo del neonato, a Paduan fresco by Titian dating back to 1511. The subject is shown three-quarter length against a plain grey background. Her curvaceous form is portrayed with exceptional realism and accuracy, and is accentuated by the wide drapery of her earth-coloured dress. The body is rotated slightly, while the head looks frontally at the viewer, in a pose of remarkable naturalness and ease. What appears to be the same woman is seen in relief (inspired by ancient cameos) on a raised section of the parapet. The lower part of the parapet is original, though the raised section appears to be a revision by Titian himself, with the drapery painted under it still being visible through subsequent layers of paint. The painting is signed TV on the parapet, which probably stands for Tiziano Vecellio.

Biography  He served as colonel for ten years and became Minister of Post and Telegraph as well as Minister of Customs where he was in charge of all imports into and exports out of the Persian empire. Later he became Minister of Treasury where he was singlehandedly in charge of the entire country's coin issue. He also held the title of Minister of Defence and was Prime Minister for four terms. His highest military title was Commander in Chief. He was of the Khalatbari family. As an ethnic Persian, Sepahsalar Khalatbari was the only leader who was able to restore security inside Persia by controlling the ethnic Turkomans inside the kingdom. He was called upon many times by not only the various sectors of the Persian government but also by the Russians to suppress the Turkomans. His enormous wealth with income estimated at US$2 million/year in the early 1900s (the equivalent of $530 million/year in 2000Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2000) allowed him to be the chief financier of the Persian Empire where he would use his property as collateral for loans the kingdom obtained from Russia and Britain.

In 1909 he was given the title Sepahdar Azam and was sent by then King Mohammad Ali Shah to crush the Azerbaijani constitutionalist uprising in the northwest headed by Baqer Khan and Sattar Khan. He arrived in Azerbaijan but refused to fight the constitutionalist forces deeming it \\"fratricide\\". Instead he returned to Tonekabon and due to his genius military skill and national democratic following became the leader of the constitutionalist and anti-royalist forces, the same forces he was sent to crush. As their new leader he first occupied the city of Qazvin and then marched onto Tehran. During his march to Tehran the Russian foreign ministry in Saint Petersburg sent a telegram to the Russian Embassy in Tehran stating: \\"Please inform His Excellency Sepahdar Azam that if he and his army peacefully march on Tehran and then proceed to the house of Saad al Dowleh, then on the authority of this telegram, Sepahdar Azam and all his relatives and kin will be placed in the protection of the Tsarist government.\\" Sepahdar Azam (Khalatbari Tonekaboni) wrote back \\"The Russian government believes I have done all this for my own personal gain.

Rejecting the Tsarist government's request, he continued his march and forced the royalists in Tehran to surrender. King Mohammad Ali Shah fled and sought refuge in the Russian embassy, then left Persia altogether. He accepted the title of Sepahsalar (Commander in Chief). Sepahsalar-e Khalatbari Tonekaboni became Minister of Defence in the first constitutionalist government that followed dethroning of King Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar in 1909. He subsequently became Prime Minister of Iran four times. As the largest property owner in Persia his noble \\"Khan\\" status allowed him to rule several fiefdoms in Gilan and Mazandaran provinces, including the city and regions surrounding Tonekabon. Sepahsalar Khalatbari Tonekaboni continued to fight the religious clerics' attempts to create a theocracy as well as the ruling establishments attempts to continue a monarchy. He took frequent trips to France to learn the French system of representative democracy. With the advent of the Pahlavi dynasty and the Reza Khans, imposed by the British in the 1920s, Sepahsalar Khalatbari Tonekaboni was placed under increased political pressure.Shuster, Morgan (1912) The Strangling of Persia, Unwin Publications Much of his property was seized by the new government in an attempt to control his wealth and his power.

Life John Stephenson emigrated to the United States from Ireland with his parents, James and Grace Stephenson, when he was two years old. After attending public schools in New York City, he completed his education at the Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. At the age of 19, he became an apprentice to Abram Brower, the pioneer of the Broadway stage lines. Stephenson died at his summer home in New Rochelle, New York in 1893.DEATH OF JOHN STEPHENSON; THE BUILDER OF STREET CARS PASSES AWAY SUDDENLY, August 1, 1893 Streetcars in New York in 1870 First streetcar In May 1831, Stephenson started his own business, the John Stephenson Company, on 667 Broadway where he built omnibus cars for Brower until a fire destroyed his shop in March 1832. He immediately moved to a new site on Elizabeth Street near Bleecker where he continued to build omnibuses which proved to be a huge success on the streets of New York.Biographical Dictionary of American Business. From Google Books. Retrieved 27 February 2009. However, soon afterwards he received an order from John Mason, a successful merchant and banker, to build a horse car for the New York and Harlem Railroad which had just been granted a charter authorizing a route from Fourth Avenue and the Bowery north to the Harlem River. The first stretch was opened from Prince to 14th Street on November 26, 1832, with a procession of the four cars developed for the company. Stephenson's car, named \\"John Mason\\" or simply the \\"Mason\\" after the company's president, was in the lead with the mayor and other dignitaries. He had modeled it after the English four-wheeled passenger railroad car but dropped the body down over the wheels for easier access. Four horses pulled the car and it carried up to 30 passengers in its three compartments.Clay McShane, Joel Arthur Tarr: The Horse in the City. From Google Books. Retrieved 27 February 2009. It was Stephenson's design which was finally adopted. In April 1833, he obtained a U.S. patent for it.The John Stephenson Car Co. Retrieved 27 February 2009. Failures and successes Orders for his design came in not only received from New York and other U.S. cities but also from Cuba. In 1836, business prospered even more rapidly after Ross Winans developed his eight-wheeled vehicles. Stephenson built a larger factory at Fourth Avenue and 129th Street. At first business prospered and he received an increasing number of orders, especially for railway cars. He was doing good business when the panic of 1837 struck the country, causing him years of distress as the bonds he had accepted in lieu of cash for orders became worthless. In 1842, his business finally failed and he lost all his property. He was only able to pay his creditors 50 cents on the dollar.Fred. Dietz: A Leaf from the Past. Retrieved 27 February 2009. Undeterred, Stephenson found a new site on West 27th Street, where in 1843 he started to develop a business which eventually covered 16 city lots. Streetcars continued to gain popularity, allowing Stephenson to prosper for the remainder of his life. It was not long before he had fully reimbursed all his creditors and became known as Honest John Stephenson. From 1852 he put all his efforts into building streetcars of various types as their popularity extended to cities throughout the world including, for example, Port Elizabeth, South Africa,Eastern Province Herald, June 18, 1880. Bombay and Caracas. For many years, he was the world's largest builder of streetcars. By the time of his death in 1893, his factory had 500 employees and was producing some 25 cars a week.Lance Day, Ian McNeil: Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology from Google Books. Retrieved 26 February 2009. As time went by, Stephenson introduced a number of improvements to his streetcars. Perhaps the most important was to reduce the weight from 6,800 pounds to just 3,500 pounds, allowing just two rather than four horses to pull the vehicle. He achieved this by using hickory or ash instead of oak and adding larger windows rather than wood. He placed seats along the sides of the vehicle and used a single rear entrance rather than doors along the side. He also devised many other improvements in rail car design and was successful in filing at least 11 patents in his own name. It is estimated that the John Stephenson Company made some 25,000 cars in the period 1876‚Äì1891 alone and an untold number over the life of the company.

Developing out of a tropical depression near the northern Philippines in early June, Conson slowly traveled towards the north. Gradually strengthening, the storm reached typhoon status late on June 7 according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and several hours later according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. After turning towards the northeast, the typhoon brushed Taiwan and reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph 10-minute winds) on June 9\\\\. After reaching its peak, Conson gradually weakened, passing through Okinawa before being downgraded to a tropical storm the next day. On June 11, the storm made landfall as a minimal tropical storm in the K≈çchi Prefecture just before becoming extratropical. The extratropical remnants continued towards the northeast and were last mentioned on June 14 crossing the international date line. Typhoon Conson brought heavy rains and high winds to the Philippines, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Japan. Flooding in the Philippines killed two people and caused about PHP1.6 million (US$35,000) in damages. However, some reports state that up to 30 people died in the Philippines. In the Ryukyu Islands, the storm brought heavy rains and high winds to several islands, damaging crops and leaving many without power. As it became extratropical, Conson caused moderate damage in southern Japan, including a few landslides which prompted evacuations. Throughout Japan, losses reached 355.7 million yen (US$3.8 million).  Meteorological history  Early on June 4, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of low pressure associated with deep convection about 780 km (485 mi) south-southeast of Hong Kong. Later that day, following notable development, they classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. At the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also began monitoring the system as a tropical depression. Slowly moving towards the southeast, 07W gradually strengthened, being classified a tropical storm by the JTWC at 1200 UTC the next day. Around the same time, the storm entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's area of responsibility and was given the local name Frank. Twenty-four hours later, 07W made its closest approach to the Philippines, passing within 295 km (185 mi) of Manila. A few hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Conson; a name contributed by Vietnam that is a picturesque place in the country, consisting of a mountain, pine forest, streams, pagodas and many historical monuments. A ridge located over the central Philippines caused Conson to turn towards the north. Continuing to intensify, the JTWC assessed the storm to have reached typhoon status at 1800 UTC on June 7. The JMA also upgraded the storm to a typhoon about twelve hours later. A 28 km (17 mi) wide eye developed as the cyclone turned towards the northeast. Originally, forecasts showed the typhoon making landfall in southern Taiwan but the turn towards the northeast spared the island from a direct hit. Shortly after being classified as a typhoon by the JMA, the JTWC upgraded Conson to a Category 2 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph 1-minute winds). The eye later became slightly disorganized and the cloud tops around the center warmed. However, the storm reorganized the next day and was upgraded to a Category 3 typhoon by the JTWC with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph 1-minute winds). The intensification was the result of the influence of an approaching shortwave trough which enhanced poleward outflow. Around this time, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon 'Frank' as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Typhoon Conson near peak intensity on June 9 The strengthening was the result of Conson passing over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current. The forward motion on the typhoon also began to increase as it interacted with a baroclinic zone. Shortly after, the JMA assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum pressure of 960 hPa (mbar). Later that day, the storm passed over Okinawa as it weakened. By June 10, Conson began to undergo an extratropical transition. Continuing increase in forward speed caused the low to become exposed from shower and thunderstorm activity on the southern edge of the circulation. Around 1200 UTC, the center of circulation became separated from deep convection, leading to the typhoon being downgraded to a tropical storm by both agencies several hours later. Early on June 11, the JTWC reported that the storm had completed its extratropical transition just south of Japan. However, the JMA kept Conson has a tropical cyclone through its landfall in K≈çchi Prefecture as a minimal tropical storm. Shortly after landfall, it was classified as an extratropical cyclone. Continuing towards the northeast, the storm remained weak and was last mentioned as it crossed the international date line on June 14 near the Aleutian Islands. The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor between the two is 1.14x. JMA's peak intensity for Conson was 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160 km/h (105 mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Conson was 185 km/h (115 mph) 1-minute sustained, or 155 km/h (100 mph) 10-minute sustained. The National Meteorological Center of China estimated a peak intensity of 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160 km/h (105 mph) 1-minute sustained. The Hong Kong Observatory assessed Conson to be slightly weaker than other agencies, with peak winds estimated at 130 km/h (80 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 150 km/h (90 mph) 1-minute sustained.  Preparations and impact  Philippines = On June 7, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration raised Public Storm Signal No. 1 for most of Luzon. As Conson strengthened into a typhoon, northern areas of Luzon were placed under Public Storm Signal No. 3, resulting in school closures. As the typhoon passed by the Philippines, it dropped heavy rains, peaking at 333.8 mm (13.1 in) in Iba. The highest 24‚Äëhour rainfall was recorded in Subic Bay at 230 mm (9 in). Minor flooding and power outages were reported in Manila. These heavy rains led to flooding which reportedly killed 30 people in Luzon. However, the fatalities are uncertain as PAGASA reported that two people were killed by the storm. In all, Conson caused about PHP1.6 million (US35,000) in damage. = Taiwan and Hong Kong = High winds and heavy rain warnings were issued for most of Taiwan along with sea warnings. Schools and businesses on Orchid Island were suspended on June 9 and 10 as Typhoon Conson passed by. Some domestic flights were cancelled and rail and ferry services were suspended ahead of the storm. When Conson was first classified, Hong Kong was placed under a standby signal as the storm was located within 800 km (500 mi) of the city Only a few showers were reported in the city due to the storm. Taiwanese officials checked water gates throughout the island on June 8 and found that 68 were missing. Water management officials stated that the missing gates could \\"...wreak unnecessary damage...\\". The following day, 42 of the missing gates had been replaced. Fishing boats returned to port for shelter during the storm. An emergency operations center was set up to carry out search and rescue missions during and following the typhoon. Heavy rains from the typhoon peaked at 262.5 mm (10.3 in) in Yilan County. The storm caused minor damage and one minor injury during as it passed by Taiwan. Although Conson dropped heavy rains across the island, it was not enough to alleviate drought conditions in the southern areas. = Japan = TRMM satellite image of Conson becoming extratropical on June 10 Traveling towards the northeast, Conson headed towards Okinawa where schools were closed and local transportation was disrupted due to the storm. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned residents about the threat of heavy rains and high winds resulting from the storm. A United States naval base located in Okinawa was placed under a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCR) Four as Typhoon Conson was approaching. As the storm neared the islands, the naval base was put under TCCR Three, indicating that winds of 92 km/h (57 mph) were anticipated within 48 hours. Ahead of the storm, upwards of 254 mm (10 in) fell across the islands, which were indirectly related to the storm. In southern Japan, several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions. Heavy rains, peaking at 345 mm (13.5 in) on Tarama, triggered flooding and landslides throughout the islands. The highest sustained winds on the islands were also recorded on Tarama at 137 km/h (85 mph) and the highest gust was recorded on Miyako-jima at 185 km/h (115 mph). Despite transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while impacting Japan, Conson brought heavy rains and high winds to Ky≈´sh≈´. The highest rainfall and gusts were recorded in Tanegashima at 277.5 mm (10.9 in) and 146 km/h (91 mph) respectively; the highest sustained wind was recorded in Muroto, K≈çchi at 109 km/h (68 mph). On Ishigaki Island, high winds and heavy rains cut power to many residences and damaged crops. A total of of agricultural land was damaged by the storm, leaving 31.9 million yen (US$346,000) in losses. Significant agricultural damage was also sustained on Miyako-jima, leaving 76.5 million yen (US$805,000) in losses. Okinawa sustained moderate damage during the passage of Conson, with several homes flooded and large lengths of power lines were lost. At the height of the storm, roughly 3,300 residences were without power and 1,305 power lines were downed. Additionally, of agricultural land was damaged, leaving 32.3 million yen (US$350,000) in losses. In Kagoshima Prefecture, Conson damaged of agricultural land and flooded six homes. Agricultural and property damage in the prefecture amounted to 100 million yen (US$1 million) and 115 million yen (US$1.2 million) respectively. A large landslide, roughly wide, in Matsuyama, Ehime prompted the evacuation of 19 homes; however, no known damage resulted from the incident. Throughout K≈çchi Prefecture, several highways were shut down after being damaged by Conson. Over 20 schools were let out early due to the deteriorating conditions.

His five months in office and eventual departure from the police force were fraught with controversy, however, his two-year campaign against the New York underworld eventually rid the city of the many street gangs active since the early-to mid 19th century. In the years following his retirement, McKay also had a successful career in business, holding high-level positions in a number of corporations. Biography He was born on May 25, 1883, in New York City. McKay attended New York City College and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1905 as a second lieutenant.

(pg. 749) =Police Commissioner= When McKay was appointed New York City Police Commissioner by reform mayor John Purroy Mitchel on December 31, 1913, who chose McKay the basis of his reputation, he was the youngest man ever to have held the position. He immediately went into action by initiating a sweep of Manhattan to clear out the countless street gangs, many of whose origins could be traced to the 1860s and earlier, then active in the city. He also made reforms within the NYPD, particularly concerning police corruption, which included \\"breaking\\" or demoting several high-ranking police officers. On one occasion, he demoted a police inspector to captain and then suspended him for allowing honky-tonks to operate in the Tenderloin district. He also revived the police lineup and used it with such success that it was kept by the police force on a permanent basis. In the aftermath of a gun battle that lasted nearly a half an hour in front of Arlington Hall, during which court clerk Frederick Strauss was shot and killed, Mayor Mitchell personally ordered McKay to \\"suppress the gangs at all costs\\". The previous order prohibiting use of clubs by Mayor Gaynor was rescinded. McKay immediately suspended the local precinct captain in which the battle occurred and sent in Deputy Commissioner George Samuel Dougherty with a squad of detectives who arrested over 100 gang members within twenty-four hours.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 343) McKay's tactics, although successful, were the source of frequent arguing and criticism between himself and the mayor's office. His militant attitude against the New York underworld concerned local politicians, particularly in Tammany Hall, who felt he was a political liability. A number of magistrates also expressed concern over the commissioner's hasty actions. They also complained that his \\"sight arrest\\" orders, in which loiterers were subject to immediate arrest, filled up city's jails overnight. The situation created a serious problem by delaying the city legal system when many of these cases the charges would be dropped for lack of evidence. McKay responded by expressing a lack of backing from the city and that, in his opinion, his position was regarded by city officials as \\"the Mayor's secretary for police affairs\\". =Later career= McKay eventually left the police force after five months, his successor Arthur Woods carrying on his campaign against the underworld which ended in 1916, taking a position as vice president of J.G. White & Co. and become president of the International Pulverized Fuel Equipment Corporation in 1918. Upon the United States' entry into World War I, McKay returned to military service as a colonel and was assigned as director of artillery ammunition production in March 1918. In August 1922, he was elected president of the Standard Coupler Company.\\"Items of Personal Interest\\".

(August 1922): 224+ McKay later returned to the police force for a brief time during Prohibition, serving as special deputy police commissioner and became the state commander of the American Legion in 1928. McKay eventually entered the insurance business and, in 1935, he became president of the New York Title Insurance Company. McKay later retired to San Jose, California, where he died on September 24, 1962. He was survived by his wife Pauline and two daughters, Mary and Patricia McKay.

Early life Cook was born on 23 January 1817 in Clapham, London. He was the son of William Cook and Mary Ann (n√©e Lainson) Cook. Career In 1833, he entered his father's firm Cook, Son & Co. based in the City of London, which traded finished wool, cotton, linen and silk, after travels in Europe and the Near East. From 1869, he was its head, rising to be one of Britain's three richest men. He was created 1st Visconde de Monserrate, Sintra, Portugal, and on 10 March 1886, he was created 1st Baronet Cook, of Doughty House, Richmond, Surrey. =Collections= In 1849, he bought Doughty House in Richmond and in 1855 the quinta of Monserrate in Sintra, Portugal. There, he restored Monserrate Palace, a Moorish-style palace, and became visconde de Monserrate (Viscount of Monserrate). He began to collect classical sculpture in the late 1850s. He collected his first major paintings in 1868, at which date Sir John Charles Robinson (1824‚Äì1913), former Victoria and Albert Museum curator, became his advisor. He had 510 major works by 1876 and in 1885 added a Long Gallery to Doughty House to accommodate the growing collection, making this gallery open to scholars. His collection was left, in trust, to his eldest son and his heirs.

One of the most prominent police reformers during the early 20th century, he served as deputy New York City Police Commissioner from 1907 to 1909 and later became New York City Police Commissioner in 1914. During his time with the New York City Police Department, he was largely responsible for initiating the application of criminology and sociology in modern policing.Arthur Woods Biography In his later years, Woods worked with the Division of Military Aeronautics and was involved in government committees on unemployment under the administrations of Presidents Warren G. Harding and Herbert Hoover. Woods was also an important public servant as trustee for the Board of Education and presided as president and chairman of the board of Rockefeller Center. Early life Arthur Woods was born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 29, 1870, to Joseph Wheeler and Caroline Frances Woods. He attended Harvard University, graduating in 1892, and did his post-graduate work at Harvard and the University of Berlin. He also received a LLD degree from Trinity College, Connecticut in 1910. Career After his post-graduate work in Berlin, he became a schoolmaster at Groton School in 1895. One of his students, Franklin D. Roosevelt, later became elected to the presidency of the United States. In 1905, he accompanied William Howard Taft, Nicholas Longworth, and Alice Roosevelt to the Philippines and then continued alone traveling the world for another year before returning to the United States. Leaving Groton after a decade of service, his interest in sociology led him to become a reporter for the New York Evening Sun for $15 a week. He became interested in police work while working as a reporter and soon gained the attention of the Police Commissioner Theodore A. Bingham, who liked his ideas for reforming the police system, and led to his appointment as deputy police commissioner of the New York City Police Department in 1907. Woods was responsible for instituting better police training by introducing an official police academy modeled after Scotland Yard, which taught courses on law and sociology as well as physical training. A staunch advocate of community policing, Woods believed that the common rank- and-file policeman should be in a position of social importance and public value. He also felt that the public would benefit if they were more informed of issues affecting the community and the local police precinct. As part of that system, he published the first safety booklet available to the general public.Moreno, Barry. Manhattan Street Scenes. Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2006. (pg. 8, 68) During his time as deputy commissioner, Woods became well educated on gang related violence and was a supporter of Inspector Joseph Petrosino and the \\"Italian Squad\\", a special detectives unit which combated organized crime in Italian-American neighborhoods. He was partially responsible for its revival following Petrosino's murder in 1908, although the squad remained more low-profile then its previous incarnation. It was not officially reinstated for another decade.Reppetto, Thomas A. American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 2004. (pg. 75-76, 82) A year later, he left the NYPD and went into the lumber business in Mexico and the cotton converting business in Boston before returning to the police force five years later. =New York City Police Commissioner= As part of newly elected Mayor John Purroy Mitchel's reform campaign, Woods succeeded Douglas I. McKay as New York City Police Commissioner in April 1914. Continuing his predecessor's efforts against the many street gangs operating in the city at that time, breaking up gangs in a systematic sweep from the Battery to Spuyten Duyvil which concluded with the Hudson Dusters two years later, he also became involved in labor racketeering during the \\"Labor Slugger War\\". Working with District Attorney Charles A. Perkins, he was responsible for the arrests of over 200 known criminals during his first year in office.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 343-344) He retired from policing in 1918. His removal as police commissioner was a direct result of Mitchel's election loss to Tammany Hall-backed John Hylan, a Brooklyn judge, in 1917. =Military service= That same year, he became an assistant director on the Committee of Public Information on foreign propaganda. In early 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assigned to the Division of Military Aeronautics for the United States War Department. He became a full colonel in August and, after a 3-month tour with the American Expeditionary Force overseas, he was appointed assistant director of military aeronautics. In 1920, he was awarded medals from three different countries: the Distinguished Service Medal (U.S.), Order of St. Michael and St. George (U.K.) and the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor (France).\\"Harvard Man May Land Chief Prohibition Post\\". _The Harvard Crimson._ 17 Jan 1925 Following the end of World War I, he became an assistant to the United States Secretary of War Newton D. Baker in charge of efforts to reestablish returning American servicemen in civil life. From 1921 to 1922, he presided as chairman on Committee on Civic and Emergency Measures as part of President Warren G. Harding's Conference on Unemployment. In 1925, he was considered to succeed Roy A. Haynes as national prohibition commissioner. Woods also served as trustee for the Board of Education and presided as president and chairman of the board of Rockefeller Center. In addition, he assisted John D. Rockefeller in the restoration of historic Williamsburg, Virginia, a near four-year project lasting from 1927 until 1931. In the early years of the Great Depression, he was the chairman of the President Herbert Hoover's Committee on Employment. In 1937, he retired from public life due to ill health and settled at 3014 North Street in Washington, D.C. where he lived with his wife for several years. Personal life On June 10, 1916, Woods married Helen Morgan Hamilton, granddaughter of industrialist J.P. Morgan and descendant of U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. Together, they were the parents of four children: * John Pierpont Woods (1918‚Äì2012), who married Claire Warren Streeter (1920‚Äì2006), daughter of Edward Streeter, in 1947. They divorced in 1953, and in 1954, he married Joan Holden, daughter of Hale Holden Jr. of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. * Leonard Hamilton Woods, who married Anina Paepcke, the daughter of Walter Paepcke and Elizabeth Nitze (the sister of Paul Nitze) of Chicago, in 1948.

Biography Charles McDonnell was born at his home on Anthony Street in Manhattan, New York on November 18, 1841. He attended the local Sixth Ward public school and later went to work as a newsboy and later employed as a folder in the pressroom of a morning newspaper. He eventually joined the New York City Police Department and was officially appointed a patrolman on January 21, 1863. Assigned to the Sixth Precinct, he was still a rookie when the New York Draft Riots broke out months later and was on constant duty in the Fourth and Sixth Precincts.\\"Death Of Capt.

He slowly rose through the ranks after being promoted to sergeant on November 11, 1867 and finally captain on February 25, 1870. His first command was the old Twenty-Eighth precinct and, during the next four years, served as precinct captain of the Twentieth, Twenty-First and Thirty-First Precincts. On November 11, 1874, McDonnell was transferred to the Eighth Precinct where he remained for the rest of his career.

Brewster for the murder of rival gambler Eibo Williams on July 16, 1887. In the winter of that year, McDonnell suffered a severe attack of inflammatory rheumatism but had apparently recovered while vacationing with his wife and sister at their summer home in Derby, Connecticut. He had been suffering from dyspepsia, aggravated by bronchial trouble, in previous years. McDonnell returned to the city on August 13, 1888, reportedly \\"looking well and hearty\\", but intended to arrange to extend his leave of absence and return to Derby the following evening. He was on duty at the stationhouse that day and, leaving orders for a morning wake up call at 9 am, went to bed in the sergeants' room on the second floor at around 10:00 pm. He was seen \\"sleeping peacefully\\" by a Sergeant Reilly at 6 am, however he was found dead three hours later when a doorman came to wake him up. A doctor was summoned, but physicians found that he had been dead for several hours. McDonnell's body was moved to his home on King Street home while his wife was informed by telegraph and requested to return to the city.

Usage While the lord of the house commanded the final say in all matters, the need to delegate certain tasks to the highest ranking servant of the house necessitated a specific location where records could be kept. Following the founding of both Oxford and Cambridge, an increasingly literate aristocracy replaced the largely uneducated peerage. As the power of England grew, so did the wealth of the elite as did the need of the great houses of England to bring in a better informed class of help. This better educated servant class permitted the person so designated to acquire supplies and obtain services to maintain and run large buildings with many servants. The earliest form of butler's desk was a high desk for use by a standing person. It had many drawers of different size and had locks on both the drop front (which later developed) and individual drawers - the size of the drawers being governed by the size of the documents they contained and for personal use (some of the larger drawers being used for the butlers clothes in order to save space in the head butlers personal room). Many of these desks would have a secret compartment reserved for any important documents that were entrusted to the head butler by the master. By the 1850s the butler's desk became far more stylistically diffuse. There were many instances where the desk of the lord of the manor was handed down to the head of the house. As the role of the butler became more oriented to a kind of overall manager and coordinator for household functions, the taller earlier desk was abandoned for a more practical piece of furniture.

This process is incorrectly often known as mortgage repossession; however assets can only be repossessed if the lender was the seller, which is often the case with cars but not usually houses. The correct terminology is possession. The process typically involves obtaining firstly an order for possession in the courts, then an eviction warrant. The eviction is carried out by bailiffs. Once the lender has obtained possession, it can then sell the home to recoup any lost arrears. Mortgage possession involves legal proceedings in which a mortgagee, or other lienholder, usually a lender, obtains a court order for possession of a property, prior to exercising the mortgagor's equitable right of redemption. Usually a lender obtains a security interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset like a house to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults the lender can possesses the property. Mortgage possession is not to be confused with foreclosure. In the United Kingdom foreclosure is a little used remedy which vests the property in the mortgagee with the mortgagor having no right to any surplus from the sale. Because this remedy can be harsh, courts almost never allow it. Instead, they will usually grant an order for possession and an order for sale, which mitigates some of the harshness of the repossession by allowing the sale. Mortgagors can lose their properties by default on their lease; this could occur where there is unpaid ground rent or unpaid rent on a shared ownership property. In this circumstance the property (or rather the lease) would be subject to forfeiture. Typically a lender on these properties would pay the ground rent and add it to the mortgage debt to avoid losing its rights to the property.

After World War II he dispersed the majority of the very important family collection of Old Master paintings. Life Educated at Bradfield College, he became an artist, musician and art historian, exhibiting at the Royal Academy. Paintings by Cook appear in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Manchester, Northampton and Bournemouth. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (1940‚Äì78) and an Associate of the Royal Society of British Artists (1938‚Äì48). Cook was a founding member of the Jersey Society of Artists, and the Jersey Artists Group. Forty Dutch pictures from the family art collection were sold to Katz of Dieren in 1939, with more being sold off after the family home of Doughty House was bomb damaged in 1944 ‚Äì fortunately much of the collection had been transferred to Cothay Manor in Somerset, which he also owned. Cook moved to Jersey in 1948 with the remaining 30 paintings from his collection. Some of his works stored at Le Gallais' depository in Saint Helier were lost in a fire in 1949. Many of these works were later recreated by Cook from photographs. In 1955 Cook bought a house in Saint Brelade which he restored along with its gardens. These became a subject of a number of paintings. In the 1970s he bought the former Methodist chapel at Les Augr√®s, Trinity, which he converted to a studio and gallery.

Originally prominent in the Church of Scotland, and serving as Moderator of the General Assembly in 1841, following the Disruption of 1843 he joined the Free Church of Scotland and became a prominent figure in that church.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. He was the inventor of a self-registering hygrometer. Life He was born 5 May 1786 at Old Crawfordton, Glencairn, Dumfriesshire, where his father was the parish schoolmaster. Aged 15, he was appointed parish teacher, in place of his father, who had died some years before. Gordon then decided to enter the ministry. He initially studied Divinity at the University of Edinburgh, then in 1809 transferred to Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he graduated BD around 1806. After holding several tutorships, and acting for a time as master in the Perth Academy, he was licensed by the presbytery of Perth on 27 July 1814, and was ordained as minister of Kinfauns on 12 September 1816. In February 1821 he was promoted to St. Cuthbert's Chapel of Ease, on Buccleuch Street in Edinburgh, and in January 1824 to the Hope Park Chapel of Ease, which was built for him. In September 1825 he moved to the New North Church, collegiate charge, and in 1830 to the High Church. In 1823 Aberdeen University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity (DD). In 1827 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Robert Stevenson. From 1836 till 28 November 1843 he was collector of the Ministers' Widows' Fund. In the 1830s he is listed as living at 27 Lauriston in the Tollcross area of the city. When the conflict which led to the disruption of the Scottish church began, Gordon sided with the non- intrusionists, and was one of the committee appointed in 1839 to consider the case of the seven suspended ministers of Strathbogie; and during the same year he appeared in the court of session to support the presbytery of Dunkeld, then threatened with censure for disregarding the interdict in the Lathendy case. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met at Edinburgh on 20 May 1841, Gordon was chosen Moderator, both parties uniting in his election; in this capacity he had to pronounce the deposition of the Strathbogie ministers. Gordon presided at the public meeting in St. Cuthbert's Church, 25 August 1841, and delivered an address. He was one of the deputation which waited on Sir Robert Peel in the following month to state the case for the church. At the general assembly in 1842 Gordon seconded the adoption of the claim of right moved by Thomas Chalmers. During the convocation held in Roxburgh Church in the following November, Gordon presided, and delivered a speech, which has been described as the best apology for the Free Church movement. In the Disruption of 1843 he left the established church, together with almost the whole of his congregation. From then until death he was minister of the Free High Church of Edinburgh. He was a member of the Royal Scottish Society and was also one of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria's Master Printers for Scotland. He died at home, 14 Northumberland Street in Edinburgh's Second New Town following a short illness, on 21 October 1853. He is buried in East Preston Street Burial Ground on the south side of the city. The grave lies on the north wall of the western section.

He also wrote introductory essays for The Redeemer's Tears, by John Howe, in 1822, 2nd edit. 1825; for the Mourner's Companion, edited by him, with works by John Flavel and others; and for 'Emmanuel,' by Samuel Shaw, in 1829. A volume of his sermons was published at Edinburgh in 1825, and after his death a selection appeared under the title, 'Christ as made known to the Ancient Church,' vols. i. and ii. on the historical books of scripture in 1854, and vols. iii. and iv. on the prophetic books in 1855.

It is the alleged site of the battle between an invading Anglo Saxon army, under Cerdic and a British army under Natanleod in the year 508.Hampshire County Council Overview Netley Marsh lies to the west of Southampton. The village is on the A336 road from Cadnam to Totton. The parish is bounded by Bartley Water in the south, and River Blackwater in the north. The village of Woodlands is in the south of the parish, and the hamlets of Hillstreet and Ower (chiefly in Copythorne parish) are to the north. The M27 motorway runs through this parish, taking roughly the route of the Roman road from Nursling to Cadnam. Since 1971, the village has been host to the annual Netley Marsh Steam and Craft Show,Netley Marsh Steam and Craft Show a three-day event dedicated to demonstrations of steam-powered vehicles and traction engines held in July of each year. Netley Marsh is the base for the international development charity Tools for Self Reliance,Tools for Self Reliance which refurbishes and ships old tools and sewing machines to Africa. History Netley Marsh is often identified with the \\"Natanleaga\\" described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle under the year 508, where it is reported that the Anglo-Saxon kings Cerdic and Cynric \\"killed a certain British king named Natanleod, and five-thousand men with him ‚Äì after whom the land as far as Cerdic's fordUsually identified with North Charford and South Charford near Fordingbridge. was named Natanleaga\\".Michael Swanton, (1996), Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, page 14, Ms. A, s.a. 508, modified after Frank Stenton, (1973), Anglo-Saxon England, page 20. Whatever the truth concerning the battle, it is unlikely that there was a king called Natanleod ‚Äì he was probably invented to explain the place-name Natanleaga. In fact the place-name is probably derived from the Old English elements naet and leah, meaning \\"wet wood\\". Netley is next recorded as \\"Nateleg\\" in 1248. The name \\"Netley Marsh\\" appears as such on maps from 1759. The church, dedicated to Saint Matthew, was built around 1855, and consists of a nave and chancel with a bell turret on west side of the chancel. To the west of the village the Hampshire Reformatory School opened in 1855.Victoria County History of Hampshire: Eling It was built for the purpose of reclaiming juvenile offenders, and had accommodation for 60 boys.William White, (1878), History, gazetteer and directory of the county of Hampshire, page 221 It was closed in 1908. The civil parish of Netley Marsh was one of the parishes formed from the ancient parish of Eling in 1894. The village suffered some damage during World War II, when one day in 1942 an enemy plane dropped bombs on the church and along Woodlands Road, causing the deaths of three people.Parish Plan 2010, page 13, Netley Marsh Parish =Tatchbury= One mile north of Netley Marsh is the ancient site of Tatchbury. There is an Iron Age Hill fort here called Tatchbury Mount. It has been partly built over by the hospital buildings of Tatchbury Mount Hospital but the outline of the fort can still be seen. Next to the hill fort is the ancient manor of Tatchbury. Its history dates from the 10th century when a hide and a half of land in Tatchbury and Slackstead was given to Hyde Abbey (near Winchester) on its foundation in 903 by Edward the Elder. The Domesday Book refers to another half hide being given to the Abbey sometime after 1066 by Edsi the Sheriff.Domesday Map ‚Äì Tatchbury. Another entry in the Domesday Book refers to two hides which had been placed into the New Forest at Teocreberie ‚Äì this may to refer to Exbury rather than Tatchbury. Cf. Domesday Map ‚Äì Exbury The abbot and convent evidently held the manor in demesne from the 12th to the 13th century, and a rent from Litchfield and Tatchbury was included in the estates of the Abbey at the time of the Dissolution. Another estate in Tatchbury is recorded in the 13th century which may have been the nucleus of the later manor which was held in 1316 by Elias Baldet, and of which John Romsey died seised in 1494, holding it of the warden of Winchester College. The Oviatt family held the manor for much of the 17th and 18th century, before passing to the Wake family who held it until the late 19th century. Tatchbury Manor House today is mostly a brick Victorian building, but which incorporates part of the old 13th century manor house.

Under Baker's leadership, GFI has published several economic reports estimating that nearly US$1 trillion per year flows illicitly out of developing countries.

Their vision is a society where everyone has equal access to the same rights and opportunities.United Response: mission statement and vision History United Response was founded in 1973 by Su Sayer, CBE. She opened the first service in Tillington, West Sussex. By 1979, it was the largest provider of support for people with learning disabilities in the region. In 1983, United Response expanded to the north of England, setting up its first service in Chesterfield. In 1990, the charity started working with people with mental health needs. Seven years later, it began implementing person-centred active support under the guidance of the late Professor Jim Mansell, CBE, who joined the Board of Trustees in 1995. In 1999, United Response launched the first of many social enterprises, a cleaning company under its trading arm, UR in Business. The company employed people with a learning disability. In 2002 the charity began working with the University of Kent‚Äôs Tizard Centre to study, monitor and evaluate the quality of its support. In 2006, United Response ran a project entitled Mental Wealth to raise awareness of issues facing people with mental health needs as a backdrop to the then-Mental Health Bill. In 2008 the charity launched Making Money Easier ‚Äì a suite of accessible resources to support people with learning disabilities access banks and manage their money.United Response: How we help with money In 2010, United Response began its Every Vote Counts campaign, which it repeated in 2015, encouraging more people with learning disabilities to vote.United Response: Every Vote Counts campaign In 2013, United Response launched Easy News, the first accessible news magazine for people with learning disabilities.United Response: About Easy News United Response supports over 2,000 people, works in more than 300 locations across England and Wales, and employs over 3,500 staff. Services The services United Response provides depend on each person they work with. United Response provides 24-hour support for people with profound physical needs, or just a few hours for those who need less support to live their lives. They job coach people into meaningful paid employment and can provide outreach support for those with a mental health need or help people who find it difficult to communicate by making information more accessible. One of United Response‚Äôs primary support techniques is person-centred thinking: they work with each person to do the things they want to do, supporting them to communicate what it is they want. They have also pioneered active support and positive behaviour support as ways of involving people with even the most complex needs and challenging behaviour in all areas of their lives.The Charity Commission Campaigns In support of United Response's vision, they also campaign to improve the lives of people with disabilities in society. This may mean lobbying decision makers such as Members of ParliamentAble Magazine to ensure that people's voices are heard or it might mean working directly with disabled people so that they can be more directly engaged in the democratic process. United Response also works with employers to ensure that more people with learning disabilities, mental health needs and physical disabilities get a fair opportunity to work.Voluntary Organisations Disability Group =Every Vote Counts= United Response‚Äôs most recent major campaign is Every Vote Counts, which aims to make politics and voting accessible to people with learning disabilities. Currently, at least half a million people with learning disabilities in the UK have the right to vote but don't use it, due to low awareness of their rights and the complexity of the political system.The Guardian Since 2010, the charity has been working with people with learning disabilities and politicians to change this by publishing easy read guides to voting,The Guardian urging all political parties to communicate more accessibly, and campaigning publicly for greater awareness of the fact that most people with learning disabilities are entitled and have the mental capacity to vote.BBC Ouch United Response is committed to ensuring that people with learning disabilities are able to advocate for themselves whenever possible and use their own voices to promote change. When the campaign was re- launched ahead of the 2015 general election,Access Magazine the charity recruited political correspondent David Allkins,ITV News who has Asperger syndrome and communication difficulties, to create a series of exclusive video interviews and special reports aimed at making politics easier to understand for people with learning disabilities.Politics Home Following the general election, United Response quantified the results of its Every Vote Counts campaign and found that 43% of people it supports with learning disabilities voted ‚Äì a 10% increase on the numbers that voted in 2010. The survey also revealed the extent to which the campaign has reached out to new voters, with some 31% stating that they had voted for the first time, of which only 14% stated that this was due to age.Enable Magazine =Postcards from the Edges= In 2013, to mark its 40th anniversary, United Response launched the creative campaign Postcards from the Edges. Through its dedicated Postcards from the Edges website, the charity invited people with, or affected by, disabilities to create postcards about what is important to them, and in the first year alone attracted more than 500 contributors.The Guardian The aim of the project is to counter preconceptions people may have about disability and aid understanding, and provide those affected with a platform for expression.The Guardian The postcards have been exhibited throughout the UK, including the House of Commons, Bristol, London and Newcastle.Disability Arts Online Since its conception, the project has grown to feature several specific campaigns boards, including a general election board that ran alongside the Every Vote Counts campaign. =Campaigns Panel reports= United Response‚Äôs Campaigns Panel is an informal network made up of around 20 people it supports with disabilities around the country, plus some family members.

Easy News uses simplified text and pictures to provide people with learning disabilities with easy to understand, politically neutral summaries of key news stories and events. United Response also employs groups of people with learning disabilities and autism, known as UR Consultants,The Guardian who are experts in easy read communication, to select and translate the stories within Easy News, and provide consultancy services to businesses throughout the UK.

Deeper Learning in Leadership : Helping College Students Find the Potential Within. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2007., p. 30-31. A four-year academic and experiential learning program for top students at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Presidents Leadership Class was named to honor the president of the University of Colorado as well as the corporate presidents and executives involved in the program's formation. History The PLC program was founded and operated for 40 years as an independent non-profit organization in close partnership with the University of Colorado Boulder. On July 1, 2012, PLC was officially adopted by the university as a fully integrated top scholar program. Founded in 1972, the PLC began as a conversation between William A. Douglas, dean of admissions, and then assistant director of admissions, Terry Heineman. Heineman had attended the University of Oklahoma, where he was involved with an undergraduate program similar to what PLC eventually became. After many discussions, Heineman and Douglas thought it worthwhile to initiate a similar leadership program at CU Boulder as a recruitment strategy to attract and retain Colorado's top students. Both felt it important to involve the outstanding leaders in the state to lend additional credibility to their concept. This inclination led them to William Coors, chairman of the Coors Corporation. These three, along with several other corporate and community leaders, moved forward and developed the Presidents Leadership Class, named in honor of the university president and the corporate presidents involved in the program's formation. The first board of directors included very esteemed members of the university and surrounding community: William Coors, chairman of the Coors Corporation; Emmett Heitler, president of Samsonite Corporation; Theodore Brown, president of First National Bank of Denver; Frank Raggio, executive at Martin-Marietta; Al Flanagan, president of Channel 9 and later president of Gannett Broadcasting; and William Douglas, dean of admissions, registrar, and financial aid at CU Boulder. Membership Each year, the Presidents Leadership Class selects up to 60 of the most exemplary freshman students attending the University of Colorado at Boulder. Students wishing to become part of the Presidents Leadership Class apply to the program during their senior year of high school through the CU Boulder General Scholarship Application. Applications are due every year on February 15. PLC receives an average of 500 applications each year for the 50 positions for incoming freshman. PLC established a second-point-of-entry for rising sophomores in 2013 and has admitted at least two rising sophomores to the incoming cohort each year since. The General CU Boulder Scholarship application consists of a detailed history of a student's academic record, test scores, community service, leadership roles, extracurricular activities and a general essay. The PLC application additionally, requires three short essays, evidence of one creative achievement, one teacher/coach/supervisor/mentor recommendation, and one counselor recommendation. From 500 applications, PLC selects 160 in-state students and between 25 and 30 out-of-state students to participate in interviews with a panel of judges composed of alumni, community leaders, parents of PLC students, and university officials. Scholarships Each year, 50 of the University of Colorado Boulder's most talented incoming students and select rising CU and transfer sophomores enter as PLC Scholars. Each student is awarded $1,000 their first year in the program. Once they have completed the first year, students become eligible for many other scholarships over the next three years of their undergraduate career. Scholarships come form various sources including: the William A. Douglas Endowment, FirstBank, El Pomar Foundation, Ball Foundation, Cecil Walker and family, the Alvin Flanagan fund, the Hoelscher Memorial Scholarship, Annabelle K. Lutz Voss Scholars, the Van Lanschoot Family Scholarship, the Leo Hill Endowment, the Brian Watson Foundation, alumnus Tim Pestotnik and directly from the University of Colorado. The program PLC scholars receive four years of rigorous academic and experiential leadership development training, fostering both intellectual, personal and professional growth. Scholars experience a multi-dimensional program that integrates academic course work, experiential learning, community impact projects, and involvement with industry and community leaders. The various elements combine to encourage and develop the skills and character traits key to innovative success. Students who complete the PLC program requirements and complete the leadership capstone course receive a Leadership Studies Minor. Results In a recent survey, 91% of PLC alumni responded that PLC has helped them perform at a higher level in their career as compared to other college graduates. Campus placement and board of advisors The program operates within the Office of the Provost and under the supervision of the Associate Vice Chancellor for Undergraduate Education, Dr. Mary Krauss. The organization has a prestigious Board of Advocates who work closely with the director to raise awareness, support student achievement, and assist with fund raising and development for PLC. The board is made up of business and community leaders, PLC alumni, current students and includes both the university chancellor as well as other distinguished faculty from CU Boulder. Alumni network Founded in 1972, the Presidents Leadership Class boasts an active alumni network of more than 2000. All PLC students are given access to this network to find jobs, mentors, and friends whenever desired.

Baroud is one of the few political personalities who is appreciated by both ends of the rivaled Lebanese political clan and thus, subsequently holds good esteem with many of the personas across the complex and contentious Lebanese political spectrum. An attorney by formation and practice, Baroud is an expert on issues of decentralization and electoral law reform.

During his mandate as minister of interior, Baroud was credited for pushing forward a culture of responsibility and openness where he made himself easily accessible to all Lebanese citizens eager to share complaints and/or opinions, and was widely present in day-to- day activities of his subordinates. His actions resulted in an unpremeditated cultivation of a very attractive public image that he still possesses today. Baroud was also credited with overseeing Lebanon's best-managed round of elections to date in 2009, which he orchestrated in one day instead of the conventional four weekends, a record in Lebanese history. This has earned him the First Prize of the prestigious United Nations Public Service Award where Lebanon was ranked first among 400 government administrations from all over the world by the United Nations Public Administration Network (UNPAN).

Early life and education Ziyad Baroud was born on 29 April 1970 in Jeita, Keserwan into Maronite family of Selim and Antoinette (n√©e Salem). The first of two children, Baroud and his younger sister Maha were brought up in a middle-class civil household with no political ancestry, where both parents were high school teachers; their father a senior grade mathematics teacher and their mother an Arabic literature teacher. Baroud completed his high school education at Coll√®ge Saint Joseph ‚Äì Antoura des P√®res Lazaristes from which he graduated in 1988. He then attended the Faculty of Law at Saint Joseph University in Beirut from which he earned his Master's Degree in Law. He was admitted to the Beirut Bar Association in 1993. From 1993 to 1996, Baroud worked as a trainee lawyer in Beirut in the cabinet of Ibrahim Najjar, who later served as minister of justice in the same government as Baroud. While working in the office of Najjar, Baroud contributed along with a handful of judges and fellow lawyers to the drafting of a legal monthly supplement in An- Nahar \\"Houqouq Annas\\" (Ar: ÿ≠ŸÇŸàŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≥) or \\"People's Rights\\", the first of its kind, designed to familiarize people with judiciary rights and jargon and promote the implementation and modernization of Lebanese laws with the aim of bringing more justice to society. At the same time, Baroud was pursuing doctoral studies at the University of Paris X in Paris, France, a school that also graduated Nicolas Sarkozy and Dominique de Villepin among other influential personalities. Baroud is currently preparing his doctoral thesis on the subject of \\"Decentralization in Lebanon after the Taif Agreement\\", a topic that is one of his main subjects of expertise as well as one of the major lobbying points of his political agenda. Career and policymaking activities Baroud held a number of academic posts as lecturer in two prestigious universities in Lebanon: His alma mater Universit√© Saint Joseph (USJ) and Universit√© Saint-Esprit de Kaslik (USEK). Furthermore, he sits today on the Board of Trustees of Notre Dame University. With time, Baroud became more and more involved in key public actions that took him to the forefront of national, high-profile political activism, largely due to his expertise on many impending national topics, notably electoral law, decentralization and the constitution. Electoral reform Ziyad Baroud is one of the staunchest and most active experts on electoral law reform in Lebanon. In March 1996, Baroud founded along with other activists the Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections (LADE), an independent, nonprofit organization specialized in the study of elections and electoral laws' impact on democracy. The subject of elections and electoral law reform will become another forte of Ziyad Baroud's life and political agenda. In 2004, Baroud was elected Secretary General of LADE to lead a group of more than 1,300 domestic electoral observers during the 2005 elections. In 2006, he was chosen to serve as a board member of the Lebanese chapter of Transparency International (LTA). In 2005‚Äì2006, he was commissioned by the Prime Minister of the Republic Fuad Siniora along with eleven others to serve on a blue-ribbon commission headed by Former Minister Fouad Boutros to propose a draft for electoral law reform, this commission came to be familiarly known as the \\"Boutros Commission\\". :The Boutros Commission : :In 2005, the new cabinet headed by Prime Minister Fuad Siniora launched an independent commission on 8 August 2005 headed by Former Foreign Minister Fouad Boutros to study the dire issue of the 2000 electoral law and propose a change. The commission was named the \\"Lebanese National Commission on Electoral Law\\", more casually known as the \\"Boutros Commission.\\" Twelve people, six Muslims and six Christians, were appointed, of which Baroud was chosen to be one of the key expert members. Other members included: Fouad Boutros (President), Ghaleb Mahmassany, Michel Tabet, Zouheir Chokr, Ghassan Abou Alwan, Nawaf Salam, Abdel Salam Sheaib, Fayez Al-Hajj Shahine, Paul Salem, Khaldoun Naja, and Arda Ekmekji. : :The commission met for nine months and delivered a 129-article draft law for comprehensive electoral reform to the cabinet on 31 May 2006. The 129 articles detailed a myriad of reforms including lowering the voting age to 18 years, implementing an electoral list quota of 30% female candidates, an assessment of absentee balloting for Lebanese abroad, and the implementation of comprehensive and tight regulations for political campaigns and their financial spendings, among other things.A Guide to the Proposed Draft Law .

Five weeks later, the July War broke out in July 2006 before the law could be sent to parliament. The subsequent deterioration of the political situation and closing of the legislature prevented any proposed reforms from being addressed, and remained pending. Decentralization Baroud worked as a research associate at the \\"Lebanese Center for Policy Studies\\", a Beirut-based think tank of which he is a board member today. LCPS aims to provide researched, politically neutral guidelines to serve policymaking. Baroud also consulted with the UNDP on local governance and decentralization from 2001 to 2008. He is currently the chairman of the \\"Governmental Committee of Decentralization\\" (Ar: ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßÿµÿ© ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÑÿßŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ≤Ÿäÿ©), knowing that the topic of decentralization happens to be his Doctorate Thesis subject. Minister of the interior and municipalities Following the deadly clashes of May 2008, on 21 May 2008, figures from both the opposition and majority signed the Doha Agreement under the auspices of Qatar's foreign minister and prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, finally diffusing an 18-month crisis. The Doha negotiations resulted in the long-awaited election of General Michel Sleiman as President of the Lebanese Republic and the formation of the 70th national unity government led by Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, composed of 30 ministers distributed among the majority (16 ministers), the opposition (11 ministers) and the president (3 ministers). Ziyad Baroud, who had been engaged in serious national struggles for democratization for over 15 years, stood out as a professional and committed civil society activist. Newly elected President Michel Sleiman consequently named Ziyad Baroud as Minister of Interior and Municipalities. Baroud served as Minister of Interior and Municipalities under two consecutive cabinets. The first cabinet led by Prime Minister Fuad Siniora in the 70th national unity government which lasted from 11 July 2008, until November 2009. Baroud successively served for a second term under Prime Minister Saad Hariri's cabinet which lasted from 9 Nov 2009 to 13 June 2011, though he had resigned on 26 May 2011. As Minister of Interior and Municipalities in Fuad Siniora's government, Baroud occupied one of the toughest and most high profile jobs in the country and was able to set a very high record of positive changes within many of the country's sectors. =Enforcing traffic laws= The first crackdown Baroud orchestrated was on traffic disobedience. Working closely with NGOs that promote road safety and injury prevention, notably the Youth Association for Social Awareness (YASA) and Kun Hadi (Arabic for \\"Be Calm\\", as well as a play on the word \\"Hadi\\" which is the name of a young man who died in a speeding car accident and namesake of the organization), one of Baroud's first undertakings as minister was to impose traffic laws, including seatbelt enforcement and speed limits compliance. Resultantly, under his mandate, in the first year alone, the Ministry of Interior raised the number of traffic officers from 593 to 1,800.Baroud promises traffic law enforcement. (7 December 2009).

Retrieved 9 January 2013. =Supporting freedom of association= Being an avid civil society activist and a human rights campaigner, Baroud has been known to support and actively encourage the work of Lebanon's Non- Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Thus, a major undertaking tackled by Baroud was signing off on counts of registration applications from NGOs that had been stacking up for years and never accorded registration permits. Baroud released a circular facilitating the registration of NGOs. The number of NGOs approved under Baroud rates as one of the highest in the history of the Interior Ministry. =Privacy of religious identity= Baroud is the first government official to ever officially give freedom of choice to Lebanese citizens about revealing their religious affiliation on civil registry documents.

Although the Administration and Justice parliamentarian commission wanted to try and hold the 2009 elections over two days for security reasons, Baroud made great efforts to resolve all logistical difficulties in order to hold the elections in one day. The 2009 Parliamentary Elections were consequently held over the course of one day, on 7 June 2009. The March 14 Alliance beat the opposition bloc of the March 8 Alliance winning 71 seats in the 128-member parliament to 57 seats going to the latter. This result is virtually the same as the result from the 2005 elections, yet the turnout is said to have been as high as 55%. Former US President Jimmy Carter with the Carter Center Observation Mission issued a report \\"[commending] the Lebanese people and the electoral authorities for the successful conduct of the 2009 parliamentary elections\\". The report stated that \\"Minister Baroud earned the confidence of Lebanese stakeholders through his commitment to a transparent process.\\" While the process fell short of several of Lebanon's international commitments, most notably secrecy of the ballot, they stated that \\"it was conducted with enhanced transparency.\\" The report also commended the high levels of voter participation as well as the \\"high level of professionalism being exhibited by polling staff in most of the stations visited.\\" The Carter Center final report can be found here. The European Union, who also had established a mission to observe the 2009 Lebanese legislative elections, also issued a positive report stating that \\"the high level of trust in the electoral process was certainly assisted by the clear neutrality and professionalism of the Ministry of Interior in its administration of the elections, and especially by Minister Zyad [sic] Baroud himself.\\" They point out that this neutrality is however not institutional, since it is more likely linked to the persona of Ziyad Baroud, and therefore \\"cannot be guaranteed for the next elections\\". The European Union's final report on 7 June 2009 Parliamentary Elections can be found here. Furthermore, as head of the newly formed Elections Oversight Council (OSC) which had been charged with organizing all public elections in Lebanon, Baroud's performance rating in public office was second only to Lebanese President Michel Sleiman according to public opinion polls.Lebanese parliamentary elections: who‚Äôs monitoring?.

Lebanon stayed without a functioning government for the duration of four months, a time that was ridden with political wrangling over the formation of a national unity government. Eventually, the two sides finally agreed on the assignment of portfolios after concessions were made. Fifteen ministers were selected by the March 14 Alliance, ten by the opposition March 8 Alliance, and five were allotted to President Michel Sleiman. This formula denied 14 March from upholding a majority of cabinet posts while also preventing the opposition from exercising veto, a power which requires 11 cabinet posts (‚Äúa third plus one‚Äù). Thus, theoretically, the ministers selected by President Sleiman, considered impartial, hold the balance of power in cabinet with a swing vote on decision- making. Ziyad Baroud was once again assigned as Minister of the Interior for a second term on 9 November 2009. Due to the highly politicized and contentious atmosphere, Baroud's freedom of action as a Minister was severely reduced because of political wranglings he refused to get involved in. The contention between the 8 March and March 14 alliances often left him with no authority over policies and many of the security-related areas that he is supposed to constitutionally oversee, and eventually led to his resignation. =Resignation from minister of interior post= There are several conflicting accounts explaining what exactly happened the day that Ziyad Baroud resigned from his ministerial duties. The basic storyline, however, draws on a series of skirmishes that occurred in a one-day public showdown between different loyalists of the country's two conflicting parties of 8 March and 14 March. The dispute involved two different branches of the Internal Security Forces who had violated Minister Baroud's authority, and the Minister of Telecommunications Charbel Nahas. The dispute escalated into an 8 ‚Äì 14 March diplomatic proxy war that was unlawfully fought on grounds belonging to Minister Baroud's jurisdiction.Caretaker Interior Minister Ziad Baroud Quits. (27 May 2011). In Ya Libnan Online. Retrieved on 10 January 2013. The event was highly publicized. Television stations had caught the entire showdown on cameras. Nahas then accused the ISF and 14 March of plotting a ‚Äúcoup d‚ÄôEtat‚Äù against the state, and asked the Lebanese army to intervene. Head of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) Ashraf Rifi and 14 March responded by accusing the Telecommunications Ministry of launching a coup against the executive branch of the Lebanese government, their pretext being that the equipment at hand had been installed in 2007 by a directive ordained by the Lebanese government, and thus only cabinet-level authority were allowed to give directives to dismantle it.The Unknown Story of the Telecommunications Network.

It is said that Baroud had come close to resigning on multiple occasions prior to this event, but was prevented from doing so by President Sleiman, who needed a trustworthy ally in this all- important ministry.

He was accessible to all, and is known to have been one of the very few government officials who personally responded to emails sent by citizens. Baroud was often seen in public civilian settings going about his job, taking his own car at night to directly interact with traffic offenders. He would often stand at security check points in the late hours of the night and personally discuss the importance of speed limits and traffic laws with young speeders, and resultantly, send them to spend three days at the \\"Kun Hadi\\" association in order for them to understand the dangers they face and pose to others when they speed and violate traffic rules. One famous anecdote, which was popularized by a blog, relates a December 2009 traffic incident describing Baroud's hands-on approach. It was the month of holidays, and Baroud was caught in one of the traffic jams as police tried to get a handle on the situation marking off roads that were to be closed for the following day's Beirut marathon. ‚ÄúInstead of sitting in his blacked out Mercedes ‚Äì as you can bet dozens of other big cheeses and probably a handful of the political class were ‚Äì Baroud took matters to hand.

Mus√©e du Louvre Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil on canvas painting by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It depicts Louis-Fran√ßois Bertin (1766‚Äì1841), the French writer, art collector and director of the pro-royalist Journal des d√©bats. Ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French upper-middle class. Ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. He is physically imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through ‚Äì warm, wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust. The painting had a prolonged genesis. Ingres agonised over the pose and made several preparatory sketches. The final work faithfully captures the sitter's character,Boime (2004), 325 conveying both a restless energy and imposing bulk. It is an unflinchingly realistic depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning hair of an overweight man who yet maintains his resolve and determination. He sits in three-quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right, his fingers are pronounced and highly detailed, while the polish of his chair reflects light from an unseen window. Ingres' portrait of Bertin was a critical and popular success, but the sitter was a private person. Although his family worried about caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as L√©on Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and F√©lix Vallotton. Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Mus√©e du Louvre since 1897. Background Ingres, Portrait of Armand Bertin, 1842. Private collection. The family resemblance is visible. Louis-Fran√ßois Bertin was 66 in 1832, the year of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son √âdouard Bertin, a student of the painter,Pomar√®de (2006), 273 or via √âtienne-Jean Del√©cluze, Ingres' friend and the Journal's art critic.Ingres and Del√©cluze first met in Jacques-Louis David's studio in 1797. See Rosenblum (1999), 28 In either case the genesis of the commission is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des d√©bats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists.Burroughs (1946), 156 Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission. Ingres, Portrait of Mme Armand Bertin n√©e C√©cile Dollfus, 1843. Private collection It was completed within a month, during Ingres' frequent visits to Bertin's estate of retreat, Le Ch√¢teau des Roches, in Bi√®vres, Essonne. Ingres made daily visits, as Bertin entertained guests such as Victor Hugo, his mistress Juliette Drouet, Hector Berlioz, and later Franz Liszt and Charles Gounod.Shelton (1999), 318 Ingres later made drawings of the Bertin family, including a depiction of his host's wife and sketches of their son Armand and daughter-in-law, C√©cile. The portrait of Armand evidences his physical resemblance to his father.Shelton (1999), 320 Ingres' early career coincided with the Romantic movement, which reacted against the prevailing neoclassical style. Neoclassicism in French art had developed as artists saw themselves as part of the cultural center of Europe, and France as the successor to Rome.Zamoyski (2005), 8 Romantic painting was freer and more expressive, preoccupied more with colour than with line or form, and more focused on style than on subject matter. Paintings based on classical themes fell out of fashion, replaced by contemporary rather than historical subject matter, especially in portraiture. Ingres resisted this trend,Ingres' critically maligned The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian has been described as \\"the perfect illustration of the system's breakdown\\". See Jover (2005), 180 and wrote, \\"The history painter shows the species in general; while the portrait painter represents only the specific individual‚Äîa model often ordinary and full of shortcomings.\\"Jover (2005), 180‚Äì2 From his early career, Ingres' main source of income was commissioned portraits, a genre he dismissed as lacking in grandeur. The success of his The Vow of Louis XIII at the 1824 Salon marked an abrupt change in his fortunes: he received a series of commissions for large history paintings, and for the next decade he painted few portraits.Mongan and Naef (1967), xxi His financial difficulties behind him, Ingres could afford to concentrate on historical subjects, although he was highly sought-after as a portraitist. He wrote in 1847, \\"Damned portraits, they are so difficult to do that they prevent me getting on with greater things that I could do more quickly.\\"Rosenblum (1990), 114 Ingres was more successful with female than male portraits. His 1814 Portrait of Madame de Senonnes was described as \\"to the feminine what the Louvre's Bertin is to the masculine\\". The sitter for his 1848 Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild looks out at the viewer with the same directness as Bertin, but is softened by her attractive dress and relaxed pose; she is engaging and sympathetic rather than tough and imposing.Rosenblum (1990), 114 The portraitPreparation and execution= Ingres, 1832 study on black charcoal and graphite on paper. Mus√©e Ingres, Montauban Ingres was self-critical and consumed by self-doubt. He often took months to complete a portrait,Jover (2005), 183‚Äì4 leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.Burroughs (1946), 157 The earliest study has Bertin standing and leaning on a table in an almost Napoleonic pose.Rifkin (2000), 142 His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face.Jover (2005), 182 Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out. Frustrated by his inability to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled \\"consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and just as long as you want me to come, I am at your orders.'\\"Pach (1939), 74 After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eug√®ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval (who said he had heard the story from Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a caf√©.Shelton (1999), 302 Bertin said that Ingres, confident that he had finally established the pose for the portrait, \\"came close and speaking almost in my ear said: 'Come sit tomorrow, your portrait is [as good as] done.'\\"Rifkin (2000), 143In another version of the story, Ingres saw Amaury Duval take up the pose. See Rosenblum (1990), 102 Bertin's final pose reverses the usual relationship between the two men. The artist becomes the cool, detached observer; Bertin, usually calm and reasoned, is now restless and impatient, mirroring Ingres' irritation at spending time on portraiture.Rifkin (2000), 130 Study for the Portrait of Monsieur Bertin Ingres 1832a.jpgIngres, Study for the Portrait of Monsieur Bertin, 1832.

Fogg Museum, Harvard, MA =Description= Bertin is presented as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as \\"crab-like claws ... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are the sleeves of his coat.\\"Tinterow; Conisbee (1999), 306 The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his \\"nearly ferocious presence\\" is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar. Hans Holbein, Portrait of William Warham, 1527. Louvre, Paris The painting is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are the whites of his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair.Rifkin (2000), 141 In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome.Garb (2007), 32 Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer in a manner that is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak,\\"Louis- Fran√ßois Bertin. Mus√©e du Louvre. Retrieved 17 January 2015 his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty.Jover (2005), 184 Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face.Rosenblum (1990), 31 Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold‚Äìbrown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.Shelton (1999), 303 Jacques-Louis David, Portrait of Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s, 1817. Fogg Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge Ingres seems to have adapted elements of the approach and technique of Hans Holbein's 1527 Portrait of William Warham, now in the Louvre. Neither artist placed much emphasis on colour, preferring dark or cool tones. The Warham portrait seems to have informed the indicators of Bertin's aging and the emphasis on his fingers.Pach (1939), 13 Jacques-Louis David also explored hyper-realism in his depictions of Cooper Penrose (1802) and Emmanuel Joseph Siey√®s (1817). In the later painting, David shows tiny glints of light reflecting on the sitter's chair and painstakingly details \\"every wayward curl of [Siey√®s'] closely cropped auburn hair.\\"Rosenblum (1999), 6 The Greek meander pattern at the foot of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, confining the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon.Lubar, Robert. \\"Unmasking Pablo's Gertrude: Queen Desire and the Subject of Portraiture\\". The Art Bulletin, volume 79, nr. 1, 1997 The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right.Rosenblum (1990), 102 This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.Garb (2007), 154 The original heavily decorated frame, probably designed by Ingres The painting is signed J.Ingres Pinxit 1832 in capitals at the top left, and L.F. Bertin, also in capitals, at the upper right.Toussaint (1985), 72 The frame is the original, and thought to have been designed by Ingres himself. It shows animals around a sinuous and richly carved grapevine. Art historians Paul Mitchell and Lynn Roberts note that the design follows an old French tradition of placing austere male portraits within \\"exuberantly carved\\" frames. The frame closely resembles that of Raphael's c. 1514‚Äì15 Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione, a painting that influenced Ingres, especially in colour and tone.Shelton (1999), 305 A similar frame was used for Ingres's 1854 painting of Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII.Notes on frames in the exhibition, Portraits by Ingres, National Portrait Gallery, February 1999 Reception Monsieur Bertin was exhibited at the 1833 Salon alongside his 1807 Portrait of Madame Duvaucey. It met with near universal praise to become his most successful artwork to that point. It sealed his reputation as a portraitist, reaching far enough into public consciousness to become a standard for newspaper political satires. Today it is considered his greatest portrait. Ingres viewed all this as a mixed blessing, remarking that \\"since my portraits of Bertin and Mol√©, everybody wants portraits. There are six that I've turned down, or am avoiding, because I can't stand them.\\"Jover (2005), 216 Before the official exhibition, Ingres displayed the painting in his studio for friends and pupils. Most were lavish in their praise, although Louis Lacuria confided to a friend that he feared people might \\"find the colouring a bit dreary\\".Shelton (1999), 304 He proved correct; at the Salon, critics praised the draftsmanship, but some felt the portrait exemplified Ingres' weakness as a colourist.Shelton (1999), 503 It was routinely faulted for its \\"purplish tone\\"‚Äîwhich the ageing of the oil medium has transformed over time to warm greys and browns. Bertin's wife Louis-Marie reportedly did not like the painting; his daughter, Louise, thought it transformed her father from a \\"great lord\\" to a \\"fat farmer\\".Shelton (1999), 303‚Äì4 Unknown artist, M. B√™tin le-Veau. Parody published in Le Charivari, 1833 Given the standings of the two men, the painting was received in both social and political terms. A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Shelton (1999), 304‚Äì5 Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic F√©lix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines ‚Äì this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\"Shelton (2005), 234 Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".Cohn; Siegfried (1980), 102 The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as \\"at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive\\".Pelles (1963), 82 She notes that there is a certain amount of projection of the artist's personality and recalls Th√©ophile Silvestre's description of Ingres; \\"There he was squarely seated in an armchair, motionless as an Egyptian god carved of granite, his hands stretched wide over parallel knees, his torso stiff, his head haughty\\". Some compared it to Balthasar Denner, a German realist painter influenced by Jan van Eyck. Denner, in the words of Ingres scholar Robert Rosenblum, \\"specialised in recording every last line on the faces of aged men and women, and even reflections of windows in their eyes.\\" The comparison was made by Ingres' admirers and detractors alike. In 1833, Louis de Maynard of the Coll√®ge-lyc√©e Amp√®re, writing in the influential L'Europe litt√©raire, dismissed Denner as a weak painter concerned with hyperrealistic \\"curiosities\\", and said that both he and Ingres fell short of the \\"sublime productions of Ingres' self-proclaimed hero, Raphael.\\" The following year Ingres sought to capitalise on the success of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise.Mongan and Naef (1967), opposite plate 62 Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.Sterling (1999), 504‚Äì5 Bertin bequeathed the portrait to his daughter Louise (1805‚Äì1877) on his death. She passed it to her niece Marie-Louise-Sophie Bertin (1836‚Äì1893) wife of Jules Bapst, a later director of the Journal des d√©bats. They bequeathed it to their niece C√©cile Bapst, its last private owner. In 1897 C√©cile sold it to the Mus√©e du Louvre for 80,000 francs.Shelton (1999), 306 Legacy Pablo Picasso, Portrait of Gertrude Stein, 1906. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted,Rosenblum (1999), 16 while L√©on Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait.\\"Bertin, a newspaper magnate\\". Mus√©e du Louvre. Retrieved 1 February 2015 Gerald Kelly, Portrait of Ralph Vaughan Williams, series, 1952‚Äì53 Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\".Giroud (2007), 23 In 1907 the Swiss artist F√©lix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting √âdouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"Newman et al. (1991), 118 The influence continued through the 20th century.

Another way to find a topic is to freewrite, a method first popularized by Peter Elbow. When freewriting, you write any and every idea that comes to mind. This could also be a written exploration of your current knowledge of a broad topic, with the idea that you are looking for a narrow topic to write about. Often freewriting is timed. The writer is instructed to keep writing until the time period ends, which encourages him/her to keep writing past the pre-conceived ideas and hopefully find a more interesting topic. Several other methods of choosing a topic overlap with another broad concern of prewriting, that of researching or gathering information. ReadingBrodney, Bruce; Reeves, Carolyn; Kazelskis, Richard. Selected Prewriting Treatments: Effects on Expository Compositions Written by Fifth-Grade Students. Journal of Experimental Education, v68 n1 p5-20 Fall 1999 is effective in both choosing and narrowing a topic and in gathering information to include in the writing. As a writer reads other works, it expands ideas, opens possibilities and points toward options for topics and narrates specific content for the eventual writing. One traditional method of tracking the content read is to create annotated note cards with one chunk of information per card. Writers also need to document music, photos, web sites, interviews, and any other source used to prevent plagiarism. Besides reading what others also make original observations relating to a topic. This requires on-site visits, experimentation with something, or finding original or primary historical documents. Writers interact with the setting or materials and make observations about their experience. For strong writing, particular attention should be given to sensory details (what the writer hears, tastes, touches, smells and feels). While gathering material, often writers pay particular attention to the vocabulary used in discussing the topic. This would include slang, specific terminology, translations of terms, and typical phrases used. The writer often looks up definitions, synonyms and finds ways that different people use the terminology. Lists, journals, teacher-student conference, drawing illustrations, using imagination, restating a problem in multiple ways, watching videos, inventorying interestsMurray, Donald M. The Craft of Revision, 5th edition. Boston, MA: Thomson Heinle, 2004. ‚Äì these are some of the other methods for gathering information. Discussing information After reading and observing, often writers need to discuss material. They might brainstorm with a group on topics or how to narrow a topic. Or, they might discuss events, ideas, and interpretations with just one other person. Oral storytelling might enter again, as the writer turns it into a narrative, or just tries out ways of using the new terminology. Sometimes writers draw or use information as basis for artwork as a way to understand the material better.Andrzejczak, Nancy; Trainin, Guy; Poldberg, Monique. From Image to Text: Using Images in the Writing Process. International Journal of Education & the Arts, v6 n12 p1-17 Oct 2005Perl, Sondra. Landmark Essays on Writing Process: Volume 7, p. 26. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995 Narrowing the topic Narrowing a topic is an important step of prewriting. For example, a personal narrative of five pages could be narrowed to an incident that occurred in a thirty-minute time period. This restricted time period means the writer must slow down and tell the event moment by moment with many details. By contrast, a five-page essay about a three-day trip would only skim the surface of the experience. The writer must consider again the goals of communication ‚Äì content, audience, importance of information ‚Äì but add to this a consideration of the format for the writing. He or she should consider how much space is allowed for the communication and how What can be effectively communicated within that space?Kesselman-Turkel, Judi; Peterson, Franklynn. Secrets to Writing Great Papers. The Study Smart Series. ERIC database #ED482545, 2003-00-00 Organizing content At this point, the writer needs to consider the organization of content. Outlining in a hierarchical structure is one of the typical strategies, and usually includes three or more levels in the hierarchy. Typical outlines are organized by chronology, spatial relationships, or by subtopics. Other outlines might include sequences along a continuum: big to little, old to new, etc. Clustering, a technique of creating a visual web that represents associations among ideas, is another help in creating structure, because it reveals relationships. Storyboarding is a method of drawing rough sketches to plan a picture book, a movie script, a graphic novel or other fiction.Perl, Sondra. Landmark Essays on Writing Process: Volume 7. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995 Developmental acquisition of organizing skills While information on the developmental sequence of organizing skills is sketchy, anecdotal information suggests that children follow this rough sequence: 1) sort into categories,Sung, Yao-Ting; Chang, Kuo-En; Lee, Meng-Da. Designing Multimedia Games for Young Children's Taxonomic Concept Development. Computers & Education, v50 n3 p1037-1051 Apr 2008 2) structure the categories into a specific order for best communication, using criteria such as which item will best work to catch readers attention in the opening, 3) within a category, sequence information into a specific order for best communication, using criteria such as what will best persuade an audience. At each level, it is important that student writers discuss their decisions; they should understand that categories for a certain topic could be structured in several different ways, all correct. A final skill acquired is the ability to omit information that is not needed in order to communicate effectively. Even sketchier is information on what types of organization are acquired first, but anecdotal information and researchHazel, Paul. Toward a Narrative Pedagogy for Interactive Learning Environments. Interactive Learning Environments, v16 n3 p199-213 Dec 2008 suggests that even young children understand chronological information, making narratives the easiest type of student writing. Persuasive writing usually requires logical thinking and studies in child development indicate that logical thinking is not present until a child is 10‚Äì12 years old, making it one of the later writing skills to acquire. Before this age, persuasive writing will rely mostly on emotional arguments. Writing trials Writers also use the prewriting phase to experiment with ways of expressing ideas. For oral storytelling, a writer could tell a story three times, but each time begin at a different time, include or exclude information, end at a different time or place. Writers often try writing the same information. but using different voices, in search of the best way to communicate this information or tell this story.Murray, Donald M. The Craft of Revision, 5th edition. Boston, MA: Thomson Heinle, 2004. Recursion Prewriting is recursive, that is, it can occur at any time in the writing process and can return several times. For example, after a first draft, a writer may need to return to an information gathering stage, or may need to discuss the material with someone, or may need to adjust the outline. While the writing process is discussed as having distinct stages, in reality, they often overlap and circle back on one another. Variables Prewriting varies depending on the writing task or rhetorical mode. Fiction requires more imaginative thinking while informational essays or expository writing require more organizational thinking. Persuasive writing must consider not just the information to be communicated, but how best to change the reader‚Äôs ideas or convictions. Folktales will require extensive reading of the genre to learn common conventions. Each writing task will require a different selection of prewriting strategies, used in a different order. Technology Technological tools are often used in prewriting tasks,Bacci, Tina. Invention and Drafting in the Digital Age: New Approaches to Thinking about Writing.

Biography She was born in Plainfield, New Jersey as Marjorie Eilers on January 21, 1922, and acquired the nickname \\"Nonnie\\" during her childhood. She was a graduate of Barnard College. Her first job was at Mademoiselle in 1950 as a secretary, rising through the ranks to become fashion editor there from 1970 to 1980. She was hired by Harper's Bazaar in 1980 and remained there until 1984. The New York Times noticed the changes she made at Harper's Bazaar, highlighting how the magazine how been \\"looking a little dowdy\\", but that Moore had \\"noticeably sharpened the magazine's fashion point of view\\" by showing \\"brighter, younger and more stylish\\", complimenting her use of \\"young and exciting fashion photographers\\" such as Oliviero Toscani.Duka, John. \\"NOTES ON FASHION\\", The New York Times, January 6, 1981. Accessed February 25, 2009. Moore was hired by GQ magazine as its fashion editor in 1984. Jim Moore, the magazine's fashion director at the time of her death described the choice as unusual, observing that \\"She was not from men's wear, so people said she was an odd choice, but she was actually the perfect choice\\" and noting that she changed the publication's more casual look, which \\"She helped dress up the pages, as well as dress up the men, while making the mix more exciting and varied and approachable for men.\\" Traveling to Paris and elsewhere around the world, Moore had a knack for finding designers who had something new to offer, including Perry Ellis and Issey Miyake, whom she publicized early in their careers. Wendy Goodman of New York magazine described how \\"Nonnie was quick to pick up how important Miyake was before most people really understood his work\\", identifying and championing the work of Miyake and other rising designers. The Council of Fashion Designers of America recognized Moore with a lifetime achievement award in 1994, the year she retired.

Dronning Maud was ordered by the Trondheim-based company Det Nordenfjeldske Dampskipsselskap for the passenger and freight service Hurtigruten along the coast of Norway. She served this route as the company flagship until she was sunk under controversial circumstances during the 1940 Norwegian Campaign. Before the Second World WarBuilding and commissioning= Dronning Maud was ordered from Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted shortly after the loss of Det Nordenfjeldske Dampskipsselskap's Haakon Jarl. Haakon Jarl had suffered a collision with fellow Nordenfjeldske ship Kong Harald in the Vestfjord on 17 June 1924, sinking with the loss of 12 passengers and seven crew members.Bakka 1993: 45‚Äì46 The building order of Dronning Maud made her the first new ship to join the Hurtigruten route since Finmarken in 1912. After her 8 May 1925 launch she had her first test run in the Oslofjord on 30 June 1925 and was formally handed over to Nordenfjeldske on 3 July. Nordenfjeldske immediately sent her northwards to Trondheim from where she joined the northbound Hurtigruten service, sailing from Bratt√∏ra at 12:00 on 13 July. =Characteristics= With the construction of Dronning Maud a new concept was introduced to the Hurtigruten ships, with the First Class section moved forward to amidships and the Second Class removed altogether in order to make room for a greatly improved Third Class in the aft section. The salons and cabins in the Third Class area on board Dronning Maud were described at the time as both \\"light and practical\\". Her outer appearance was characterized by long, clean lines, a large superstructure and a long continuous promenade deck. She was considered a very seaworthy vessel and in 1931 became the first Hurtigruten ship to be equipped with the new safety feature of wireless telegraphy. By 1936 all the Hurtigruten ships had been equipped with the new technology. Dronning Maud somewhere on the Norwegian coast in 1925 =Hurtigruten service= After she entered service with Nordenfjeldske Dronning Maud sailed with passengers and freight along the coast of Norway. During her regular coastal service in the 1920s and 1930s the ship repeatedly had to come to the assistance of ships in difficulties. In 1926 she assisted the 556 ton steamer Pallas after the latter had run aground off Gr√∏n√∏y and in 1927 she helped a British trawler after it had run aground in the sound Mager√∏ysund in Finnmark. Dronning Maud herself had an accident when she ran aground south of Flor√∏ in October 1929. Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War Norway declared herself neutral and the Hurtigruten service continued as normal in the first months of the war. =Johann Schulte= During this period Dronning Maud was involved in a dramatic incident when on 1 January 1940 the 5,334 ton German merchantman shipwrecked at Buholmr√•sa after losing her propeller. Coming to the iron ore-laden Johann Schultes rescue through a north-westerly gale and snow Captain Edward M. Grundt brought his vessel close enough to the German ship so that a line could be thrown on board and used to drag the shipwrecked people to safety. In all Dronning Maud and her crew saved all 36 German sailors and two Norwegian pilots from the sinking ship. After everyone on board had been pulled to safety the German ship hit a reef near Bessaker and was crushed. During the rescue operation, carried out at night in pitch black conditions, some 100 passengers and 45 crew were on board the Hurtigruten ship. The rescued Germans were set ashore in R√∏rvik while the two pilots remained on board as Dronning Maud continued northwards. Johann Schulte rescue has been described as one of the most incredible ever accomplished on the Norwegian coast, and resulted in congratulatory telegrams to the ship when it reached Svolv√¶r and later monetary gifts to the crew. In the 1960s Captain Grundt received a gold medal from the German rescue society and a diploma from the Norwegian counterpart for his efforts. =Norwegian Campaign=Troopship duties When the Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940 Dronning Maud was northbound off Sandnessj√∏en in Nordland and continued northwards to her end port of Kirkenes in Finnmark. After arriving in Kirkenes she was requisitioned by the Norwegian government as a troopship.Abelsen 1986: 299 Dronning Mauds first troopship assignment was to take part in the transport of Battalion I of Infantry Regiment 12 (I/IR12) from S√∏r-Varanger to the Troms√∏-Narvik area. Escorted by the British heavy cruiser Berwick and the destroyer Inglefield, Dronning Maud and two smaller vessels from Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab (the 874 ton SS Kong Haakon and Hestmanden) disembarked most of the Norwegian infantry battalion at Sj√∏vegan in Troms on 16 April 1940. The remainder of the battalion was transported on the fellow Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskab steamer Prins Olav a few days later.Berg 1991: 43‚Äì44 The next day, 17 April, Dronning Maud and Kong Haakon were escorted northwards to Sagfjorden by the Norwegian the off-shore patrol vessel Heimdal. The second troopship mission Dronning Maud carried out was the transport of one infantry company, the battalion's staff, the communications platoon and one heavy machine gun platoon of the Alta Battalion from Alta in Finnmark to areas closer to the front line in Troms.Ramberg 1996: 101 The rest of the battalion was transported on the Kong Haakon and the 858 ton cargo ship Senja. The three troopships were originally meant to be escorted by the off-shore patrol vessel Fridtjof Nansen but this order was changed and the ships were instead to sail without escort. The three ships set off from Alta singly; Kong Haakon at 21:00 on 19 April, Dronning Maud at 22:00 the same day, and Senja at 04:00 on 20 April. Each of the three ships carried a heavy machine gun platoon for anti- aircraft defence, Senja had two platoons as she was transporting the battalion's horses. Dronning Maud and Kong Haakon arrived almost simultaneous at Troms√∏ at 09:00 on 20 April, then continuing southwards after a short conference with the naval authorities in Troms√∏. Dronning Maud that time sailed at 10:00, while Kong Haakon followed at 11:00, both ships still without escort. As Dronning Maud reached the island of Dyr√∏y she was stopped by the patrol boat Thorodd and told to wait for Kong Haakon. When Kong Haakon reached Dyr√∏y the two Hurtigruten ship continued to Sj√∏vegan under escort by Thorodd, arriving at 17:30 on 20 April and disembarking the troops. After the completion of her troop transporting missions the Norwegian authorities decided to use Dronning Maud to transport the 6th Landvern Medical Company () from S√∏rreisa to Foldvik in Gratangen. The company she was tasked with transporting consisted of 119 medics, along with eight horses and three trucks. In preparation for the voyage to Foldvik Dronning Maud had one 3-metre by 3-metre (9.8 ft by 9.8 ft) Red Cross flag stretched out over her bridge deck and flew two more Red Cross flags in her masts. Final voyage Dronning Maud on fire after the German attack Dronning Maud set off from S√∏rreisa at around 11:30 on 1 May 1940, arriving at Foldvik three to four hours later in calm seas and sunshine. As the ship was about to dock with the small wharf on her port side two or three aircraft of the German Lehrgeschwader 1de Zeng 2007: 359 made a low-level attack with bombs and machine gun fire on the Norwegian steamer. Seven bombs were dropped from the aircraft, with two being direct hits, one between the funnel and the bridge, the other just aft of the fore cargo hatch. The first bomb entered the engine room and blew out the ship's sides and the second exploded in the bottom of the hull. The first bomb killed everyone in the refrigeration room, four men and three women. As the crew and passengers tried to abandon ship only one or two boats could be lowered into the water due to the fire that had broken out on board. The fire also threatened to destroy the wooden wharf at Foldvik, until a local fishing boat managed to pull the burning ship some distance away from shore. Dronning Maud drifted a short distance, then ran aground, burned and sank listing to port. Following their attack on Dronning Maud the German aircraft proceeded to bomb nearby Gratangen, destroying several houses and killing two civilians.Hafsten 1991: 43 After the attack the wounded survivors were given first aid by the crew of the 378 ton hospital ship MS Elieser. In the evening the British destroyer HMS Cossack brought the most severely wounded to hospital in Harstad while Elieser transported those less critically wounded to Salangsverket. Nine medics lost their lives during the attack, while a tenth later died in a hospital near Harstad. Of the ship's crew eight died and all the materiel on board was lost when Dronning Maud went down.Steen 1958, p. 233 Thirty-one medics and crew members were injured in the sinking of the ship,Voks√∏ 1994: 36 two of them severely. The wreck of Dronning Maud remains where she sank, a short distance off the wharf at Foldvik in Gratangen. The ship is still upright at around 26 to 35 metres (85 to 115 ft) depth, at coordinates . Reactions to the sinking The sinking of Dronning Maud, an unarmed ship flying Red Cross flags and carrying medical personnel, brought a great amount of anger and criticism directed against the Germans. From the Norwegian perspective Dronning Maud had been a hospital ship and under the protection of the Geneva Conventions. The Germans retorted by pointing out that Dronning Maud had not been fully marked as a hospital ship, as she had retained her black hull instead of it being painted white with a horizontal green stripe.

PHM currently has bases in more than 70 countries that include both individuals and well-established circles with their own governance structures. It has chapters in South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), Africa (South Africa), Pacific (Australia), South America (Brazil, Ecuador), Central America (El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala), North America (USA, Canada), Europe (Italy, Switzerland, UK, Greece) and several other countries. PHM works towards the revitalisation of Primary Health Care (PHC), as described in the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978.Alma-Ata Declaration Vision of PHM: \\"Equity, ecologically-sustainable development and peace are at the heart of our vision of a better world - a world in which a healthy life for all is a reality; a world that respects, appreciates and celebrates all life and diversity; a world that enables the flowering of people's talents and abilities to enrich each other; a world in which people's voices guide the decisions that shape our lives....\\" History At the Alma-Ata Conference in 1978, health ministers from 134 countries, in association with the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, set a goal of achieving \\"Health for All by the Year 2000\\" and identified primary health care as the mean to achieve it. However, in response to continued and deepened health inequalities, on 8 December 2000, 1453 delegates from 92 countries met at Savar, Bangladesh for the First People's Health Assembly which led to the founding of the People's Health Movement and the drafting of the People's Charter for HealthWebsite of PHM. In 2005, a second People‚Äôs Health Assembly was organised and lead to the development of the Cuenca Declaration. In 2012, the Third People‚Äôs Health Assembly was held in Cape Town out of which a Call to Action was developed.

Working with other civil society organizations, PHM helped gather evidence for the WHO final report on the Social Determinants of health released in August 2008.Report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health. PDF PHM's engagement with the Commission's work also resulted in the publication of a Civil Society Report on Social Determinants of Health.Civil Society Report on Social Determinants of Health In 2011 PHM was involved in the civil society side meeting during the Conference on Social Determinants of Health, taking place in Rio de Janeiro. Campaign on Right to Health The PHM is engaged in a major global campaign to promote the Right to Health which involves coordinated national and international level action. PHM uses a consultative process in countries to involve thousands of people in making a demand for Health for All as described in the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978. The first phase of the campaign involves the production of rights-based evaluations of national health policies in countries with PHM circles. The global coordinating group has developed The Assessment of the Right to Health at the Country Level: A People's Health Movement Guide for national PHM circles to use to produce consistent reports using human rights law. The second phase of the campaign focuses on movement building and mobilisation. Global Health Watch The Peoples Health Movement plays a lead role in co-ordinating the production of the Global Health watch. In an increasingly integrated, globalised world with new cross-border threats to health, widening disparities in both health and access to health care, and an unacceptable level of human suffering and premature mortality in developing countries, people across the globe are asking, why is so little progress being made by in promoting health in the world? The Global Health Watch is designed to seek answers to this question and also to start articulating solutions. It is an endeavour to propose to the global community an alternate vision of health that is located in a vision of equity, rights and empowerment. It is a collaborative exercise, initiated by the Peoples Health Movement (PHM), Global Equity Gauge Alliance (GEGA) and Medact in 2004. An important outcome of the process is the periodic publication of a document termed the Global Health Watch ‚Äì a document that is contributed to by researchers, academics and activists from across the globe. Two editions of the document have been published, the first in 2005 as Global Health Watch I and the second in 2008 as Global Health Watch II. The third edition of the GHW is to be published in 2011. The Global Health Watch aims to: * Promote human rights as the basis for health policy * Counterbalance liberal and market-driven perspectives * Shift the health policy agenda to recognise the political, social and economic barriers to better health * Improve civil society's capacity to hold national and international governments, global international financial institutions and corporations to account (including WHO and the World Bank) * Strengthen the links between civil society organisations around the world * Provide a forum for magnifying the voice of the poor and vulnerable The document is divided into the following broad sections: 1\\\\. An analysis of the global political and economic architecture, within which are located the decisions and choices that impact on health. 2\\\\. A view of current issues and debates on health systems across the world, from which it is possible to draw appropriate lessons and propose concrete actions for promoting health. 3\\\\. Beyond Health Care ‚Äì a discussion of different determinants of health 4\\\\. The Watching Section ‚Äì dedicated to the scrutiny of global processes and institutions that are crucially important for health and health care in the globe. 5\\\\. A section proposing alternatives and highlighting stories of success and resistance that are exemplars of actual actions that have contributed to better health and health care. Thus, unlike other reports on global health, the Global Health Watch also draws attention to the politics of global health and the policies and actions of key actors. The document is also a call to all health workers to broaden and strengthen the global community of health advocates who are taking action on global ill-health and inequalities, and their underlying political and economic determinants. Not only is it an educational resource for health professionals and activists, it makes clear the need for global health advocates to engage in lobbying many key actors to do better and to do more, whilst resisting those that do harm. It also seeks to act as a catalyst for the development and strengthening of existing campaigns around the world to improve health and equity. The document published as the Global Health Watch is, thus, a culmination of a global process. Typically, each Watch is contributed to directly by over 200 people from across the globe. While the published document is an important product, it is by no means the only outcome to be desired from the entire process. The process of producing the Watch involves the animation of a large number of different processes, in different regions and countries. The process promotes the scrutiny of national and regional policies related to health. It also promotes debate among health academics and activists on key issues that are critical for the promotion of global health. The Watch itself has different uses and target audiences. It is a lobbying tool for health movements to work on policy makers in countries and global institutions. It is also a resource book for academics and health activists. It is a tool to mobilise civil society on issues of major concern. Thus the Global Health Watch goes much beyond the production of one document. Further, the launch of the GHW in different parts of the world is an opportunity to mobilise around issues that impact on access to health and health care. While the PHM is responsible for the Secretariat of the Global Health Watch, its co-ordinating group also includes Medact (based in the UK), Health Action International, Medicos (Germany) and Third World Network.  International People‚Äôs Health University ‚Äì IPHU  The International People's Health University is a short training course for young health activists focussing on the politics of health. The IPHU has organized 20 short courses entitled ‚ÄòThe Struggle for Health‚Äô of 2-week duration each. The courses have been organized in over 15 countries so far, in 9 languages and attended by about 1000 health activists from more than 60 countries.  thematic campaigns  PHM activists organise following thematic groups in addition to their local or regional activities based on local needs and issues: Extractive Industries Access to Affordable quality health care and medicines Food sovereignty Anti privatisation of Health care Gender and reproductive justice Trade and health PHM advocates that Health should not be viewed as a commodity that is traded in the market. The PHM supports the call for taking health related subjects out of the global trade negotiations and from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other regional and bilateral trade agreements. The PHM views the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights(TRIPS) as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients. It supports legislation in India and other countries which allows generic drug companies to manufacture medications still covered by patents in other countries.

The painting depicts a group of nude women at a pool in a harem. It has an erotic style that evokes both the Near East and earlier western styles associated with mythological subject matter. The painting expands on a number of motifs that Ingres had explored in earlier paintings, in particular The Valpin√ßon Bather (1808) and La Grande odalisque (1814). The work is signed and dated 1862, when Ingres was around 82 years old. He altered the original rectangular format and changed the painting to a tondo. A photograph of its original state, taken by Charles Marville, survives. Description The original rectangular version of the painting The Valpin√ßon Bather, 1808. Louvre, Paris. Woman with Three Arms (Study for The Turkish Bath. Mus√©e Ingres, Montauban. The painting is known for its subtle colourisation, especially the very pale skin of the women resting in the privacy of a bathing area. The figures are given an almost abstract and \\"slender and sinuous\\" form, and seem at times to lack skeleton. They are arranged in a very harmonious, circular manner, a curved arrangement that heightens the eroticism of the painting. Its charge is in part achieved through the use of motifs that include the implied haze of Oriental perfume, and the inclusion of vases, running water, fruit and jewels, as well as a palette that ranges from pale white to pink, ivory, light greys and a variety of browns. Ingres relished the irony of producing an erotic work in his old age, painting an inscription of his age (AETATIS LXXXII, \\"at age 82\\") on the work‚Äîin 1867 he told others that he still retained \\"all the fire of a man of thirty years\\". He did not paint this work from live models, but from croquis and several of his earlier paintings, reusing \\"bather\\" and \\"odalisque\\" figures he had drawn or painted as single figures on beds or beside a bath. The figure from The Valpin√ßon Bather appears almost identically as the central element of the later composition, but now plays a mandolin. The woman in the background with her arm extended and holding a cup resembles the sitter in his portrait of Madame Moitessier (1856). The face of the woman with her arms raised above her head in the near right is similar to a croquis (1818) of the artist's wife, Delphine Ramel, though her right shoulder is lowered while her right arm is raised. The other bodies are juxtaposed in various unlit areas behind them. Ingres drew from a wide variety of painterly sources, including 19th-century academic art, Neoclassicism and late Mannerism. The colourisation is one of \\"chastising coolness\\", while figures merge into each other in a manner that evokes sexuality, but ultimately is intended to show Ingres's skill at defying rational perspective. Orientalist influences Ingres was influenced by the contemporary fashion for Orientalism, relaunched by Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. On leaving for Italy in 1806, he copied in his notebooks a text extolling \\"the baths of the seraglio of Mohammed\\", in which can be read a description of a harem where one \\"goes into a room surrounded by sofas [...] and it is there that many women destined for this use attend the sultana in the bath, wiping her handsome body and rubbing the softest perfumes into her skin; it is there that she must then take a voluptuous rest\\". Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, Women at a Bath, (La grande piscine de Brousse, The Great Bath at Bursa) Salon of 1885. Hermitage, St. Petersburg Museum of Western and Oriental Art In 1825, he copied a passage from Letters from the Orient by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who had accompanied her British diplomat husband to the Ottoman Empire in 1716. Her letters had been re-published eight times in France alone between 1763 and 1857, adding to the Orientalist craze. The passage Ingres copied was entitled \\"Description of the women's bath at Adrianople\\" and reads: \\"I believe there were two hundred women there in all. Beautiful naked women in various poses... some conversing, others at their work, others drinking coffee or tasting a sorbet, and many stretched out nonchalantly, whilst their slaves (generally ravishing girls of 17 or 18 years) plaited their hair in fantastical shapes.\\" The environment of The Turkish Bath, however, bears little resemblance to the public bathing described by Lady Montagu. In contrast to Eug√®ne Delacroix, who visited an Algerian harem, Ingres never travelled to Africa or the Middle East, and the courtesans shown are more Caucasian and European than Middle Eastern or African in appearance.Ali, Isra (2015). \\"The Harem Fantasy in Nineteenth- Century Orientalist Paintings\\". Dialectical Anthropology. 39 (1): 33‚Äì46. For Ingres the oriental theme was above all a pretext for portraying the female nude in a passive and sexual context. Exotic elements are few and far between in the image: musical instruments, a censer and a few ornaments. Provenance The painter's first buyer was a relation of Napoleon III, but he handed it back some days later, his wife having found it \\"unsuitable\\" (\\"peu convenable\\"). It was purchased in 1865 by Khalil Bey, a former Turkish diplomat who added it to his collection of erotic paintings. Edgar Degas demanded that The Turkish Bath be shown at the Exposition Universelle (1855), in the wake of which came contrasting reactions: Paul Claudel, for example, compared it to a \\"cake full of maggots\\". At the start of the 20th century, patrons wished to offer The Turkish Bath to the Louvre, but the museum's council refused it twice. After the national collections of Munich offered to buy it, the Louvre finally accepted it in 1911, thanks to a gift by the Soci√©t√© des amis du Louvre, to whom the patron Maurice Fenaille made a three- year interest-free loan of 150,000 Francs for the purpose.

The term is used both generically and also as a specific train type. In Germany and Austria it is also referred to colloquially as a D-Zug, a short form of Durchgangszug (\\"through train\\"), and express train services were often given numbers preceded by the letter D. The similar term, sn√§llt√•g, was used in Sweden until January 1980. On the railway networks operated by the Deutsche Bahn (DB), the Austrian Federal Railway (√ñBB) and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) today, express trains are divided into categories such as Eurocity, Intercity, Interregio etc. The DB still occasionally runs D-Zug services in night trains (D-Nacht), especially those to its eastern European neighbours, and as relief trains. Museum services running on DB routes are also given D-Zug numbers.  Germany  The first express trains = The first German express train ran on 1 May 1851 between Berlin and Deutz am Rhein (today part of Cologne) and completed the journey in 16 hours. Three months later, on 1 August 1851, the first night train ran from Berlin to Bromberg. The Prussian state demanded a country-wide network of night trains; consequently the various railway companies started up fast courier trains in the years that followed (1852 to 1854), from Berlin to Breslau, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg and Cologne. Passengers on the night-time courier trains between Berlin and Frankfurt had to pay a higher fare for the first time in order to compensate for the higher crew costs of night-time through trains. Up to 1889 fast train services were given the letter S for Schnellzug (express train, plural: Schnellz√ºge ) or K for Kurierzug (courier train). From 1889 all such services in Germany were given the standard letter S. = Durchgangszug (D) = From 1892 a new train category with especially comfortable express coaches appeared: the Durchgangszug or D-Zug (plural: D-Z√ºge). Originally these were trains in which one could walk right through from end to end by means of bellows-type corridor connectors between coaches and side corridors or centre aisles within coaches, unlike the hitherto usual compartment coaches with doors on each side of the compartment, but no access to the next coach. The first D-Z√ºge ran on 1 May 1892 on the following routes: * Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof‚ÄìPaderborn Hauptbahnhof‚ÄìK√∂ln Hauptbahnhof and * Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof‚ÄìNordhausen‚ÄìFrankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof. They comprised 1st and 2nd class coaches, dining and sleeping cars (on night trains). They were meant to be not only very comfortable but also particularly punctual. A supplement of 2 marks was payable on D-Zug services. In 1894, the first D-Zug with third class coaches ran between Berlin and East Prussia. By 1917 almost all Schnellz√ºge in Germany had been gradually reclassified as D-Z√ºge or converted to supplement- free fast-stopping trains, the so-called Eilz√ºge. The only standard fare trains which did not stop at all stations were the beschleunigte Personenz√ºge (BP) or \\"fast passenger trains\\". A few Schnellz√ºge remained in Bavaria where they attracted supplementary fares on the Munich-Mittenwald-Innsbruck line; these did not become D-Z√ºge until 1929. = Fernschnellzug (FD) = Rheingold coach from 1928 From 1923 very fast trains were grouped into a new Fernschnellzug (FD-Zug) or \\"long-distance express train\\" category and only offered 1st and 2nd class accommodation (e. g. FD Rheingold), whilst the majority of D-Z√ºge at that time ran with 1st, 2nd and 3rd class coaches. FD services were withdrawn on 22 August 1939. From 1933, FD trains were joined by express railcars of the Flying Hamburger type. These trains were classed as FDt or Fernschnellzug mit Triebwagen (\\"long-distance express train with railcar\\") and usually offered 2nd class accommodation only. These services ceased on 22 August 1939. = Military trains in the Second World War = During the Second World War a new train type, the so-called Schnellzug f√ºr Fronturlauber (\\"military express train\\", literally the \\"express train for those on leave from the front\\") or SF-Zug was created. These expresses took the shortest route between the Wehrmacht's operational theatres (including France, Greece and the Soviet Union) and the Deutsche Reich. Some SF-Zug services were open to the general public. This category was the SFR-Zug (Schnellzug f√ºr Fronturlauber mit Reisezugteil or \\"military express with passenger section\\"). Because there were not enough SF-Zug services to meet the Wehrmacht's transportation requirements, numerous express trains were modified into DmW-Z√ºge or Schnellz√ºge mit Wehrmachtsteil (express trains with military sections), in which the Wehrmacht reserved several coaches for its own use. On 23 January 1945 all express train services in Germany were suspended. Only international trains from Berlin to Copenhagen and Prague continued to run until April 1945. = After the Second World War = A D-Zug from Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìD√ºsseldorf on the Saar railway at Mettlach On 22 September 1945 the first express trains to run after the end of the war worked in the US zone between Frankfurt am Main and Munich. As early as 1952 the Deutsche Bundesbahn procured D-Zug coaches of the later UIC type X. Coaches of similar design were ordered by the √ñBB in 1957 and the SBB in 1969. On 1 January 1968 the Deutsche Bundesbahn abolished the supplementary fare for D-Zug services for journeys over 80 kilometres and, from 1979, for journeys over 50 kilometres. The demand for D-Zug links steadily reduced from 1979.Heinz Klein-Arendt: 10 Jahre Interregio. Ein Erfolgszug auf dem Abstellgleis?. In: Eisenbahn-Kurier, No. 321, June 2001, , p. 52‚Äì56. In the 1982 summer timetable the supplement was abolished on most of the DB's D-Zug routes. Within the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany, the Schnellzug remained the primary long-distance service. A two-tier supplementary fare (Zone I up to 300 kilometres - 3 marks, Zone II over 300 - 5 marks) was retained until the inception of the 1991 summer timetable. Until the 1980s, the majority of express trains on domestic routes comprised eight-wheeled Rekowagen (\\"reconstructed coaches\\"), reinforced by 1st class Modernisierungswagen (\\"modernised coaches\\"). Modernisierungswagen and Y coaches were mainly employed in high-grade and international services. Not until the delivery of centre-door (Mitteleinstieg) and Halberst√§dter express coaches were the, by now obsolete, Rekowagen cascaded to less important duties. = Fernzug (F) = For the 1951 summer timetable the DB introduced a new class of train: the Fernzug (\\"long-distance train\\"). These trains linked the economic centres of the German Federal Republic with one another. The trains were initially given the \\"old\\" FD designation and, on 22 May 1955, F for Fernzug and operated until 1956 with 1st and 2nd class coaches; and thereafter exclusively with the (new) 1st class. The trains always included a dining car or coach with a buffet section that was managed by the DSG. To begin with, on the Rhine railway, some trains were combined in up to four sets and operated using pre-war VT 04 and VT 06 and the new post-war VT 08 diesel multiple units. As well as DMUs, locomotive-hauled trains of 3 to 5 pre-war coaches were also used. These were steel-bodied, standard coaches (Einheitswagen) of various types. The interiors of the compartments and corridors of these coaches were refurbished and given new carpets. The external livery was changed from the standard bottle green to steel blue (RAL 5011). In addition the words Deutsche Bundesbahn or, if the coaches were only used on domestic routes, the initials DB were mounted on the sides in silver letters. In all at least 76 coaches were converted for this role. They included the coaches from the Henschel-Wegmann train. With the delivery of new coaches of the later UIC Type X, the pre-war coaches were superseded in Fernzug service. The blue F-Zug livery was adopted later as the paint scheme for the new 1st class coaches. For these very fast trains which stopped at just a few stations ‚Äì as in FD times ‚Äì a special Fernschnellzug supplement was payable. The Fernz√ºge were replaced in 1971 by Intercity trains. The famous TEE Rheingold which ran from Amsterdam to Geneva and the Rheinpfeil (Dortmund to Munich) were both initially classed as F-Zug services between 1962 and 1965, before they were upgraded to the TEE category. = City-D-Zug (DC) = The City-D-Zug (DC) was introduced by the Deutsche Bundesbahn in its 1973 summer timetable. These trains were supposed to connect three times a day to the economic centres linked by the IC network, as feeder trains to that railway system. However the concept was not a success because they were timetabled to meet the two-hourly IC trains that only had 1st class services, leaving 2nd class passengers hanging around for their connexions. In addition, the coaching stock of DC-Z√ºge was no better than the general standard for normal express trains. An initiative to develop special luxury coaches specifically for the DC-Zug was dropped in favour of the Eurofima project with its standard, high-comfort coaches (Eurofima-Wagen) for six European countries. In 1978 the DB axed this train category. Many trains continued to run on as normal D-Z√ºge, several of them being integrated into the Interregio network 10‚Äì15 years later (e.g. the Emden‚ÄìM√ºnster‚ÄìHagen‚ÄìGie√üen‚ÄìFrankfurt/Main service). = FernExpress (FD) = The FernExpress was a train type with 1st and 2nd class passenger classes and the historic abbreviation FD, which was introduced by the DB for its 1983 summer timetable. These trains, which had individual names, mainly linked the Hamburg area or the Ruhrgebiet with holiday resorts in southern Germany. Some also travelled abroad. The 2nd class coaches in these trains all comprised former non-airconditioned IC compartment coaches of the Bm type, that became available when they were replaced in Intercity services by the new air-conditioned open coaches. The all 1st class coaches were also taken from the IC fleet, the restaurant cars comprised QuickPick buffet cars, later also the half-buffet cars, type ARmz218. They were joined in most cases by second class through coaches to other holiday destinations. The FD train, K√∂nigssee, between Hamburg and Berchtesgaden also included a so-called Kinderland-Wagen (\\"children's world coach\\") that had a large children's play area. The Allg√§u between Dortmund and Oberstdorf and the Berchtesgadener Land between Dortmund and Berchtesgaden also incorporated such coaches later on. The demise of FD-Z√ºge came in the early 1990s as more and more IR, IC and ICE trains served the holiday regions.

These were express trains with few stops, similar to the DB's F-Zug services, but offering both 1st and 2nd class. An Expresszug supplement was payable in addition to the Schnellzug fare. After it had disappeared during the 1960s in domestic services, it was re-introduced in the 1969/70 timetable with the arrival of the DR Class VT 18.16 express DMUs. Ex-Z√ºge in the DR in 1972: * 2/3: Leipzig-Berlin * 6/7: Leipzig-Berlin * 54/55 Vindobona: Vienna-Berlin * 121/122 Berlinaren: Berlin-Malm√∂ (not available for domestic services) * 147/148 Karlex: Karlovy Vary-Berlin * 154/155 Hungaria: Budapest-Berlin * 311/312 Neptun: Berlin-Copenhagen (not available for domestic services) * 347/348 Karola: Karlovy Vary-Leipzig (only in summer) The international trains were converted in the years that followed to normal D-Z√ºge again. The most famous representatives of the Expresszug category were the St√§dteexpress trains introduced in 1976. In 1987 the new category Interexpress (IEx) emerged for international service, to which normal D-Zug fares applied.  Austria  The first Austrian express train (Schnellzug) ran in 1857 from Vienna to Trieste. In Austria they emerged later than in Germany, because the railway companies shied away from their higher running costs. In 1861 the first express train ran from Vienna to Budapest, in 1862 express services began on the Vienna to Dresden line via Prague and in 1868 the first express ran from Vienna via Krakau and Lemberg to Bucharest. In 1887 3rd class coaches appeared in express trains for the first time, whilst the Hungarian expresses were made up exclusively of 1st and 2nd class accommodation until 1912.Alfred Horn: Die Nordbahn. Later, in addition to the usual Schnellzug, the Expresszug (Ex) category was introduced along with √ñBB Class 4010 express multiple units (Triebwagenschnellzug orTS). These have been replaced in recent years by the new Eurocity and Intercity train types. In night services, most Schnellz√ºge have become EuroNight trains.  Switzerland  In Switzerland the Schnellzug train category was not entirely dropped from the SBB network until the timetable change on 12 December 2004, when it was replaced by the terms RegioExpress and InterRegio which can be used in all its official languages. One year later the Rhaetian Railway (RhB) followed suit. This process had started a long time before, when the Schnellzug category began to be replaced initially by the InterCity type, some of which have become InterCity-Neigezug (ICN) or Intercity tilting trains of the SBB RABDe 500 class.  Italy  Until its demise on 9 June 2007 the Diretto in Italy was one of the most important categories, filling the gap between local and long-distance traffic. The Diretto had the role of travelling directly from A to B, but served medium-sized stations (unlike the InterCity). The Diretto can be compared to the Austrian Regionalexpress (REX) services. In former years there was also the Rapido long-distance, supplementary fare service, which only stopped at important stations. This type of train was later replaced by the Intercity.  The express train today  Occasionally the D-Zug category is still used today for day trips with special trains. In the bulk of railway services in Germany, Austria and Switzerland it only exists as a successor to the Schnellzug in the form of trains like the ICE, the Intercity and the Interregio trains (whose original designation during the planning phase was XD), the latter having been replaced meanwhile in Germany by Intercity services.  International  The first luxury express train was the Orient Express which ran for the first time on 5 June 1883 from Paris to Vienna. It was followed on 9 May 1896 by the Nord Express from Paris to Saint Petersburg. These expresses only had first class accommodation, and could only be used on payment of a high supplement. They were therefore only within the reach of a small group of customers. = Special variations = Within Germany, apart from the DB the Cologne-Bonn Railways ran Schnellz√ºge on its network until 1975. These trains achieved journey times between Cologne and Bonn that were comparable to those of the DB. A D-Zug supplement was payable on these trains. = Night trains = The DB still occasionally runs D-Z√ºge in night services, especially to Germany's eastern European neighbours (D-Nacht). Some of the supposed D-Nacht-Z√ºge comprise only a few through coaches, which are coupled to other night trains. This train category does however have the advantage that they are not bound by the fare regulations of night trains, but are treated as normal long-distance services. As a result, they are used inter alia in southern Germany as a substitute for late IC connexions that are operated by DB Autozug rather than DB Fernverkehr. Many night trains run as D-Nacht services into Germany's eastern European neighbours. One provider of night express trains is CityNightLine. However, CityNightLine was shut down and all night trains ended with the December 2016 schedule change.

He worked for the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, as an assistant city solicitor from 1869 to 1873, and then as city solicitor until 1875. He was a Republican Presidential elector for Hayes/Wheeler in 1876.Smith 1898 : 364 He was in private practice in Cincinnati from 1876 to 1909, during which time he was a professor of equity jurisprudence and trusts at the Cincinnati Law School, from 1901 to 1904. He was president of the Ohio State Bar Association in 1902. Federal judicial service Warrington was nominated by President William Howard Taft on March 16, 1909, to a joint seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge John K. Richards. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 16, 1909, and received his commission the same day. On December 31, 1911, the Circuit Courts were abolished and he thereafter served only on the Court of Appeals. He assumed senior status on October 6, 1919, becoming the first judge to enter this form of semi-retirement, which had recently been created by statute. His service terminated on May 26, 1921, due to his death in Cincinnati.

Adaptation is one of the three pillars of empiricism in Scrum. The need for adaptation A software system passes through a potentially long software engineering cycle and before delivery, requirement engineers, designers and software developers realize the components of the system. However, it is impossible to anticipate the requirements of all users, and a single best or optimal system configuration is impossible. The active involvement of users and clear understanding of user and task requirements is a challenge in the development of computer-based interactive systems for two reasons: * The potential user groups may not be known at the start of the project, and would need to be identified according to future scenarios of how the software system will be used. These groups need to be revised as the system design evolves because there may be various groups of potentially affected users. * The design of the project may include substantial changes compared to the users‚Äô current experience of a system; therefore, users may not be confident and precise about their needs concerning this future system. With their norm for \\"Human-centred design processes for interactive systems\\" the International Organization for Standardization gives guidance on user-centered design activities throughout the life cycle of computer-based interactive systems. One of the core tasks of user-centred design is to negotiate and facilitate the communication across the well-known user-developer gap while acknowledging the different forms of expression and different requirements on each side. However, despite the implementation of a human-centred design process, some types of modern applications require instant adaptation due to their exposure to increasing situational dynamics. Adaptivity and adaptability Even if the user-centred design process implemented in a project guarantees a certain degree of user acceptance and yields a richer understanding of the context of use, the completed product's ability to adapt to changing conditions still plays a central role for a broad acceptance. The operational environment will change, the tasks will be distinct, the end-users will be heterogeneous, and their competences and expectations will evolve. Here again it is impossible for developers to anticipate all possible requirements modifications. Thus, the dynamics of changing conditions shifts the customisation process of the system's characteristics from the development phase to its usage and operation phase because the time needed for a professional development is too short or the new features are too costly. For this reason, developers implement techniques of adaptation into the system in order to react to changing conditions as fast as possible. The example application scenario clearly shows an important distinction concerning such adaptation techniques: the differentiation between manually and automatically performed adaptation processes. Accordingly, the term adaptation decomposes into the two terms adaptivity and adaptability. Adaptivity indicates a system that adapts automatically to its users according to changing conditions, i.e. an adaptive system. Adaptability refers to users that can substantially customise the system through tailoring activities by themselves, i.e. an adaptable system. Adaptive and adaptable systems are complementary to each other. Both methods increase the match between user needs and system behaviour once the development of the system has been finished. Thus, the system is kept flexible during usage. Catalysts for adaptation Changing conditions trigger the execution of an adaptation. Many characteristics might be taken into account as catalysts for such an adaptation process. They can be clustered into three main categories: inter-individual, intra-individual and environmental differences. Inter-individual differences Inter-Individual Differences address varieties among several users along manifold dimensions. Physiological characteristics like disabilities are of major concern for application designers if they want to have their system accepted by a large community. The consideration of user preferences like language, colour schemes, modality of interaction, menu options or security properties, and numberless other personal preferences are popular sources of adaptation and can be reused in different applications. Other sources are the user's interests and disinterests, psychological personality characteristics like emotions, self- confidence, motivation, or beliefs, which are difficult to assess automatically. Intra-individual differences Intra-individual differences consider the evolution and further development of a single user, as well as the task over time. A static system falls short of changing user requirements as the user's activities and goals evolve. In an extreme case users are over- strained by the system in the beginning and perceive the same system as cumbersome and restricted as the user's expertise increases. In the same manner, the need for a higher flexibility of computer systems is pushed by the changing of the tasks to be accomplished with such a system. Environmental differences Environmental Differences basically result from the mobility of computing devices, applications and people, which leads to highly dynamic computing environments. Unlike desktop applications, which rely on a carefully configured and largely static set of resources, ubiquitous computing applications are subject to changes in available resources such as network connectivity and input/output devices. Moreover, they are frequently required to cooperate spontaneously and opportunistically with previously unknown software services in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. Thus, the environment surrounding an application and its user is a major source to justify adaptation operations.

It was the first in a series of successful Lagerl√∂f adaptions by Sj√∂str√∂m, made possible by a deal between Lagerl√∂f and A-B Svenska Biografteatern (later AB Svensk Filmindustri) to adapt at least one Lagerl√∂f novel each year. Lagerl√∂f had for many years denied any proposal to let her novels be adapted for film, but after seeing Sj√∂str√∂m's Terje Vigen she finally decided to give her consent.Comment and summary (in Swedish) at the Swedish Film Institute It was originally released in the US as The Girl from the March Croft and the UK as The Woman He Chose. However it is today generally referred to as The Lass from the Stormy Croft, which is closer to the original Swedish title. Six other adaptions of the same novel have been made, a German and a Turkish in 1935, a Finnish in 1940, another Swedish in 1947, a Danish (Husmandst√∏sen) in 1952 and another German in 1958. Plot As described in a film magazine (with English names), Helga, the girl from the Marsh Croft, appears in court against Peter Martenson, the father of her child, but withdraws her charge when he is about to perjure himself. This wins the admiration of Gudmund Erlandson, who persuades his parents to take the disgraced young woman into their home as a servant. Gudmund becomes engaged to Hildur, the daughter of a wealthy neighbor, but then is involved in a drunken orgy where a man is murdered.

The campaign was a popular and critical success, with a number of its print and television/cinema pieces garnering awards from the advertising community.

Political science attempts to explain how societies and social organizations use power to establish regulations and allocate resources. Organizational theory uses scientific theories of management to develop deeper understandings regarding the function of organizations. Researchers have drawn a distinction between two types of politics in schools. The term micro-politics refers to the use of formal and informal power by individuals and groups to achieve their goals in organizations. Cooperative and conflictive processes are integral components of micro-politics. Macro-politics refers to how power is used and decision making is conducted at district, state, and federal levels. Macro-politics is generally considered to exist outside the school, but researchers have noted that micro- and macro-politics may exist at any level of school systems depending on circumstance. There exist significant difference between \\"Politics of Education\\" and \\"Politics in Education\\". More debates on the prevailing differences are solicited from academia of the world to define politics educationally.

Its turquoise waters and a curious tunnel-shaped rock at the centre makes a distinctive landscape. A narrow land bridge separates the northern end of Lake Posadas from the bigger, deeper Cochrane/Pueyrred√≥n Lake.  Description  Bordered by glacial moraines, Lake Posadas is located on the eastern slope of the Andes mountain range. It belongs to the Argentine-Chilean binational basin of the Baker River which drains into the Pacific Ocean. It has an important affluent, the Tarde River, and two others minor ones and it drains into Lake Pueyrred√≥n through a short river reach. Mean annual rainfall is 200 mm and annual temperature is 4.5 ¬∞C. Lake Posadas, somewhat triangular in shape, has cliffs, ravines and volcanic tuffs with no plant cover on its northeastern slope. Towards its eastern end, open steppe shrubs prevail (Senecio spp, Schinus molle, Nassauvia ulicina) with Adesmia boronioides and scanty broom sedge (Andropogon argenteus). On its southern shore there are fluvio-glacial fans bordered by patches of thickets composed of \\"duraznillo\\" (Colliguaya integerrima), \\"calafate\\" (Berberis heterophylla), and \\"neneo\\" (Mulinum spinosum). The lake's shores are stony with scanty vegetation in low shrubs.1 The basin of the lakes Posadas/Pueyrred√≥n and Ghio is the lowest glacier depression in the southern Patagonian Andes, raising only 500 ft over the sea level. Lago Posadas, fed by the glacier rushing streams of the Furioso and Tarde rivers, receives with the thawing suspended matter that confers its unmistakable color. Separated from the crystalline and deep blue Lago Pueyrred√≥n by the isthmus (La Pen√≠nsula), now drains into it, and both to the Pacific Ocean. In older times, the waters flowed to the Atlantic. From remote times the basin sheltered both human and animal life, of which give proof important archaeological remains; a guide is recommended.  Tourism  The town of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen (Lago Posadas) and the National Route 40 (Argentina) are located in the vicinity of the lake. This guarantees accessibility, lodging infrastructure and services for visitors. The whole region is known as a trout and salmonidae fishing destination, and a place also suitable for trekking, kayaking and rural tourism. From Lake Posadas it's also possible to travel to Ca√±ad√≥n del r√≠o Pinturas, entering the Patagonian steppe. There is a sector called Cueva de las Manos (\\"Cave of Hands\\"; where many ancient paintings can be found. These painting are 10000 years old.

Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1994. Belarus has an embassy and an honorary consulate in The Hague. The Netherlands is represented in Belarus through its embassy in Warsaw (Poland) and through an honorary consulate in Minsk. Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. There is no direct contact between the two countries at the government level, since the European Union decided in 1997 that such a level of contact lends legitimacy to a government the EU deems not democratically elected. On Dutch request, the European Union decided in October 2008 to soften the visa restrictions; certain other restrictions remain, such as the freezing of Belarus financial assets, and the Dutch government objects to the normalization of relations between Belarus and the European Union. The Dutch opposed to inviting president Lukashenko to attend a summit in May 2009 in Vienna, where the program was to be launched; such an invitation, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen contends, \\"would trivialize his dismal human rights record.\\" While there are no direct governmental contacts, and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs says there are no \\"intensive cultural relations\\" between the two countries (in fact, Belarus does not even qualify for Dutch financial assistance), there do exist relations between the two countries on various levels. Assistance to Belarusian children For instance, for many years children suffering from the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster had been vacationing abroad, some 1500 to 2000 of which annually in the Netherlands. In 2008, Belarus refused to give visa to those children after a 16-year-old Belarus girl had applied for asylum in the United States; Belarus also claimed that some children had not returned from vacations in the United States and Italy. Stichting Rusland Kinderhulp, the organization responsible for the housing of those children in the Netherlands, exerted pressure on the Belarus embassy in The Hague to re-open the borders. An announcement was made around Christmas 2008 that, after months of negotiations between the two countries, a group of children were allowed to spend Christmas in the Netherlands and that the travel ban was postponed until 20 January 2009. Reaction to 2006 Belarusian presidential election Events surrounding the 2006 Belarusian presidential election, which were widely criticized by European countries and the US, have added tension to already difficult relationships between the countries. A few Dutch politicians who were to have observed the elections but whose visa were revoked, protested at the Belarus border. The fallout from the elections led to the arrest of many Belarusian students, and some of them lost their passports. A request by a Dutch political party to the Dutch government to relax passport requirements for such students was denied by the Dutch Minister of Integration and Immigration, Rita Verdonk, though Verdonk did promise to exert political pressure on the Belarus government if they refused to grant travel permits to those students. The Netherlands did attempt to pressure the Belarus government; for example, the Dutch foreign minister convinced the European Union that a planned Interpol summit planned to take place in Minsk be boycotted.

Two major characters in the novel, Gaston and Bessier, like the author himself, had legs amputated due to wounds suffered in World War I. Plot summary The story of a young French priest, Gaston, who goes off to World War I. In the trenches he is mutilated, modestly administers the sacraments, hears the confessions of dying men, aids the wounded, and becomes a good friend of a Communist, Louis Philippe Bessier. Both he and Bessier are wounded in the leg, which is amputated, and both limp through the rest of the book. When they return to Paris, no one is expecting them ‚Äì neither the canons of Father Gaston‚Äôs parish nor Bessier‚Äôs employers. Gaston, who had always sustained himself with the idea that the great evil of the war could lead to good, is forced to change his mind. The world is moving away from the Church and the Church from the world. The little girl Armelle, his pupil in catechism class, of whom he is very fond and who had always written to him in the trenches, wants to become a model, and he gives her his permission, even if many of his fellow canons disapprove. Marshall masterfully recounts the Catholic Church in France between the two world wars. The more formal people are in approaching her, the more the ecclesiastical hierarchies appear closed in their moralisms, their formalisms, their solipsistic way of thinking. In the end, the Bishop sends Gaston to South America for a couple of years. When he returns, much has changed: Armelle‚Äôs mother has died and she has become a prostitute. Bessier is working for the French Communist Party. The canons of his parish barely tolerate him. During his absence, friars and priests have been forbidden to go to the barber because of some magazines there (considered risqu√© by the ecclesiastic authority). He doesn‚Äôt know this and goes to get his hair cut. Surprised by a fellow priest, the not very well-loved Fr Moune, he has a noisy argument with him in the street, attracting a small crowd. This time, too, he is punished by the Bishop. In the meantime, the World War II is drawing near: Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler have burst onto the European scene. Gaston receives another fierce blow, which is that his beloved Armelle dies giving birth to a baby girl, Michelle. But there is a place where our priest can take refuge: the convent of some nuns who appreciate his simplicity and faith. Michelle will grow up there, among countless economic hardships and countless little economies. During the German occupation, Gaston helps an English soldier, while the canons of the parish are hanging Marshal Philippe P√©tain‚Äôs portrait on the walls. But at the moment of liberation, when everyone is on the side of the Resistance, our priest this time feels obligated to help a German soldier escape with his Jewish fianc√©e, whom he himself had earlier hidden from the Nazis. The three are caught on the way by men of the Communist Party who beat them and kill the two young people. Gaston is saved at the last minute by his friend Bessier, who miraculously appears and gets him out of prison. Gaston‚Äôs eyes never heal completely from this brutal beating. In the end, mysteriously, the destinies of the characters fall into place: Bessier‚Äôs son, who has in the meantime become a ‚Äúheretic‚Äù within the Communist Party, marries the lovely Michelle, and finally Gaston becomes resident chaplain at the convent of the nuns.

She was the incumbent Jatiyo Sangsad member representing the Dhaka-18 constituency, and was the presidium member of the party. Early life Khatun was born in Kurmitola in Dhaka on 1 March 1943 to Abdul Aziz and Turjan Nesa. She completed BA and LLB degrees. She was the presidium member of Bangladesh Awami League, founding president of Bangladesh Awami Ainjibi Parishad and general secretary of Bangladesh Mahila Samity, as well as a member of the International Women Lawyers' Association and the International Women's Alliance. She started her career as a lawyer, and rose to fight cases at the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Political career Khatun was involved in politics since her student life. She entered the national political scene in 1991 when she contested the 5th Parliamentary elections as an Awami League candidate, and was defeated by Khaleda Zia of BNP, who then went on to become the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Khatun came in the scene again upon the arrest of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Khatun was one of the forerunners to induce a legal as well as a political battle in Hasina's favour. Khatun herself was charged with politically motivated crimes during the Caretaker Government's regime. With the exposure received in the run-up to the 2008 Bangladesh general election, Khatun was pitched as an Awami League candidate from the Dhaka-18 constituency. She eventually won the election, and was then appointed as the minister of home affairs of the government of Bangladesh. She took office on 6 January 2009. In a cabinet reshuffle of 2012, she was relieved of her duties as the Home Minister and made the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. =Tenure as minister= Khatun's tenure as minister of home affairs has been marred by the following controversies.  BDR mutiny  During the 2009 BDR Mutiny, Khatun led the delegation to negotiate with the mutineers, who were soldiers staging a mutiny against their officers of Bangladesh Rifles, the paramilitary force in charge of the borders. She went inside the campus of Bangladesh Rifles to stimulate negotiation and to ask the mutineers to put their arms down. The mutiny resulted in the death of 53 top officials of the army, and 3 family members.  Extrajudicial killing  Awami League in 2008 had promised in its election manifesto that it would stop all extrajudicial killings if brought to power, and Human Rights Watch observed that Awami League had failed in its promise.  Comment on Janmastami  Khatun attracted criticism in August 2010 when she asked the Hindu-minorities to cut their religious festival Janmastami short, so that it wouldn't clash with the Muslim-majority observances of Ramadan, as they coincided with the same time period. She urged the Hindu community not to make loud noises during sunset, when Muslims would be having iftar. Her comments were considered discriminatory, since a limitation on minority celebrations was being imposed for the first time; Hindu festivals had previously coincided with Ramadan in Bangladesh.  Death  Khatun died on 9 July 2020 at the Bumrungrad International Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, due to corona virus.

P. Putnam's Sons. At the time of its release, it was considered a cornerstone to the philosophy of individualism. Her biographer, Stephen D. Cox, in 2004 described Paterson as the \\"earliest progenitor of libertarianism as we know it today\\". The book has been published several times: by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1943, by Muriel Hall in 1964, by Transaction Publishers in 1993, and by Routledge in 2017. Background Isabel Paterson wrote a regular column for the New York Herald Tribune, where she first articulated many of her beliefs, which reached their final form in The God of the Machine. She also foreshadowed those ideas, especially free trade, in her historical novels during the 1920s and 1930s. Paterson opposed most parts of the economic program known as the New Deal that US president Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Congress put into effect during the 1930s and she advocated less governmental involvement in social and fiscal matters. She also led a group of younger friends (many of whom were other employees of the Herald Tribune) who shared her views. One member of that group was the young Ayn Rand. Paterson and Rand promoted each other's books, and they conducted an extensive exchange of letters, touching on religion and philosophy. That correspondence ended with a personal quarrel in 1948. Rand, an atheist, was critical of the attempts of Paterson, a deist, to link capitalism with religion, things that Rand considered incompatible.

He was the second son of Duke Jan I of ≈ªaga≈Ñ by his wife Scholastika, daughter of Rudolf III, Duke of Saxe- Wittemberg and Elector of Saxony. He was named after his maternal grandfather. Life At the time of his father's death (1439), Rudolf inherited the Duchy of ≈ªaga≈Ñ-Przew√≥z jointly with his older brother Balthasar and his younger brothers Wenceslaus and Jan II the Mad. In 1449 the Duchy was divided in two parts: ≈ªaga≈Ñ and Przew√≥z. Rudolf and Balthasar received ≈ªaga≈Ñ as co-rulers while Przew√≥z was given to Jan II and Wenceslaus also as co-rulers. In 1450 Rudolf went along with his older brother on a pilgrimage to Rome. Here, he vowed to fight for the Christian faith, evidencing his strong religious beliefs. This is also confirmed by the written sources, specifically in the \\"Chronicle ≈ªaga≈Ñ Abbots\\" (Kronice opat√≥w ≈ºaga≈Ñskich), where he is defined as a pious man. In 1454 he participated in the Thirteen Years' War at the side of the Teutonic Order. With approximately 1,900 soldiers and horses he went to ≈öwidwin. He wasn't the only Silesian ruler fighting on the Teutonic side. Together with the Bohemian leader Bernard Szumborski (Bernhard von Zinneberg) he fought in the Battle of Chojnice, where the Poles suffered a complete defeat. In the battle almost 3,000 Polish were killed, and about 300 knights were captured. Rudolf didn't survive the battle: he died on 18 September 1454 in his initial phase, facing the charge of the strong Polish cavalry. It is unknown where he was buried. After his death without issue (he never married), his older brother Balthasar assumed the full sovereignty over ≈ªaga≈Ñ. This unilateral decision left their younger brother Jan II bitterly disappointed and caused later his further revolts against Balthasar.

During World War II the land was requisitioned by the German army for an artillery position, and many of the trees, including the rows of olive trees, were cut down.

Crane Bank was acquired by DFCU Bank in January 2017 at a cost of Ush200 billion ($52.8 million) on grounds that it was undercapitalized as declared by the regulator Bank of Uganda. Overview The bank was a large financial services provider in Uganda. As of 31 December 2015, Crane Bank's assets were UGX:1.81 trillion, with shareholders' equity of UGX:281.43 billion. In October 2015, it had more than 750,000 customers. History Crane Bank started operations on 21 August 1995 \\"with a vision of being the largest privately owned Ugandan Bank.\\" In September 2012, Crane Bank acquired the assets and some of the liabilities of the National Bank of Commerce, a small, indigenous, financial services provider in Uganda that had lost its banking license. On 30 January 2014, Crane Bank established Crane Bank Rwanda Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, with the first branch in Rwanda opening to customers on 30 June 2014. Ownership On 27 January 2017, DFCU took over the bank, which had been under the statutory management of the BOU because the bank's liabilities exceeded its assets. The acquisition included all customer deposit accounts and loan accounts. The bank was previously a member of the Ruparelia Group. In September 2013, Ugandan print media reported that the bank's stock would be listed on the Uganda Securities Exchange in 2014. Those plans, however, were put on hold, with the bank explaining at the end of 2014 that it was focusing on its expansion plans first. In September 2016, Ugandan print media indicated that the bank was actively searching for a strategic partner to acquire shares in the bank. In October 2016, the potential strategic partner was identified as Bob Diamond of the Atlas Mara Limited. Negotiations were still ongoing as of 11 October 2016. On 20 October 2016, the BOU took over the management of Crane Bank and started a sale process. The thirteen bidders included DFCU, Barclays Bank of Uganda, First National Bank of South Africa, Aethel Partners Limited of the United Kingdom, and General Equity, a New Zealand-based fund. On 20 October 2016, the BOU took over the management of Crane Bank, suspending its board and acting CEO. This seizure was related to the bank's under- capitalization. Edward Katimbo Mugwanya was appointed statutory manager and reported directly to the governor of BOU. In January 2017, DFCU acquired Crane Bank. DFCU Bank had offered to recapitalise Crane Bank with US$21.6 million after take-over and Aethel Partners Limited offered UGX:1 for the bank's assets and liabilities and also committed to invest US$215 million in Crane Bank to clean the balance sheet. Whereas DFCU Bank offered to clear all of Crane Bank's verified debts, Aethel Partners insisted it would clear only part of the failed lender's debts because of the severe corporate governance and financial risks tied to the bank. These factors boosted DFCU's bid. Controversy The \\"Report on the preliminary forensic review at Crane Bank\\" (December 2016), which was authored by PricewaterhouseCoopers and commissioned by the Bank of Uganda, recommended the prosecution of Crane Bank's board of directors, investors, and senior management for allegedly flaunting Uganda's banking laws and allegedly committing various financial crimes.

He belonged to the Norwegian Labour Party from 1889 to his death, and was both party leader, party secretary as well as editor of the party organ Social-Demokraten for a period. He also made his mark as a campaigner for temperance and better health conditions. He was also chairman of the Norwegian Santal Mission. Personal life Nissen was born in Troms√∏ as the son of physician Heinrich Nissen (1802‚Äì1866) and Fayette √òrbech (1806‚Äì1884). His father had migrated from Holstein to Norway in 1825, and his mother was born at Falster. Through his mother, Oscar Nissen was a descendant of missionary Hans Egede. Nissen first married pianist Erika Lie. The marriage lasted from 1874 to 1895, and they had a daughter, Erika Nissen-Lie, born in 1878, and a son, Karl Nissen, born in 1879. Oscar Nissen married Fernanda Nissen in 1895. He was the uncle of politician Adam Egede-Nissen. Career After spending some time at sea during his youth, he enrolled as a student of medicine in 1863. His study period was interrupted twice, as he volunteered in the 1864 Second Schleswig War and as a surgeon for six months in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. He finally graduated with the cand.med. degree in 1873, and specialized in gynecology. Nissen was a devout Christian in his early life. From 1883 to 1887 he chaired the Norwegian Santal Mission. From 1884 to 1890 he edited the magazine Sundhedsbladet. Since 1876 Nissen was also an avid supporter of the temperance movement, and from 1884 to 1890 he edited the temperance magazine Menneskevennen. In the aftermath of the death of founder Asbj√∏rn Kloster, he chaired the temperance organization Det norske Totalavholdsselskap from 1879 to 1887. This period witnessed a tenfold increase of membership. He retired from the organization as the 1887 national convention would not support his proposition on prohibition. Nissen worked in Kristiania from 1884 as a specialist in women's diseases. He was not uncontroversial. At a meeting arranged by the Norwegian Students' Society on 17 November 1887, Nissen had made the claim that from his personal experience, only 10% of women had libido. He was lambasted by activist Ragna Nielsen, who tried, unsuccessfully, to channel her protest through the recently established (1884) Norwegian Association for Women's Rights. Politically, Nissen originally belonged to the Liberal Party. However, towards the end of the 1880s he aligned more with the fledgling socialist movement. In 1889 he joined the Norwegian Labour Party, founded in 1887. In the same year he marked himself as a supporter of the strike among the match factory workers. It occurred in October 1889 when three hundred match factory workers, all female, laid down their work. They demanded a slight pay raise of 1 √∏re extra per gross packed as well as better sanitary conditions. Nissen was especially concerned about the danger of contracting phossy jaw, and famously spoke at a public meeting together with Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson.S√∏rensen, 1984: pp. 114-115 Nonetheless, the strike was given up in December.S√∏rensen, 1984: pp. 116 He was the editor-in-chief of the party organ Social-Demokraten from 1894 to 1897, and served as the party secretary during the same period.

Overseen by architect and builder John Edward Pryor, construction began in 1762 and was completed in 1764. The Georgian style \\"mansion\\" was first occupied by Chief Justice Frederick Smyth by rent and approval of \\"The Proprietors\\" on April 10, 1766 to 1773. In May 1773, the mansion was repaired and fitted to be the residence of the royal governor of New Jersey, and leased by the proprietors as such. History The home was occupied temporarily, 1774 to 1776, by the Royal Governor of New Jersey, William Franklin (the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin). In January 1776, he was ordered to be held under house arrest on order of the Provincial Congress of New Jersey and under guard of the Committee of Safety. In June, after the onset of hostilities between Great Britain and the fledgling nation, he was ordered arrested and taken to Princeton for trial and then imprisoned in Litchfield, Connecticut until his release in a prisoner exchange in 1778. Proprietary House in the late nineteenth century, pictured as The Brighton Hotel After the house was ravaged by a mysterious fire in the late eighteenth century a new owner, John Rattone, of Perth Amboy restored it. Rattone was an ambitious New Yorker who added a large wing and turned the property into The Brighton, a hotel of grand stature in its day. It briefly flourished as an elegant and popular hotel until the War of 1812 brought an end to tourism and the lifeblood of the hotel. Mathias Bruen, who bought the property at a sheriff's sale in 1817, became one of the wealthiest men in America while he lived here. His descendants made large contributions to America's social and political history. In subsequent years, the original 11.5 acre site was subdivided, and the former Proprietary House was converted into a Presbyterian retirement home. It was adapted again as a hotel, but with modest accommodations. Now owned by the State of New Jersey, a portion of the building is operated as a museum by the Proprietary House Association. The upper floors of the original building and the 1809 wing are occupied by professional offices. The first floor and basement of the Proprietary House have been undergoing extensive repairs and restoration by the non-profit Proprietary House Association. The New Jersey Historic Trust and the Division of Parks and Forestry of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, along with private contributors, have greatly supported the effort to restore some of the former glory of the building. =Post-Revolution period= Either during and after the Revolution, the House suffered extensive damage. A fire gutted the interior. On February 29, 1792 an ad in the New Jersey Journal and Political Intelligence stated \\"to be sold ... eleven acres of land ... the property of the proprietors of East New Jersey... the remains of the house lately burned, will be nearly sufficient for a new building.\\" The property was not sold until John Rattoon, first official mayor of the then town of Perth Amboy. purchased it for $1,051 in 1794. Rattoon, a Perth Amboy merchant, had carefully concealed his work as an operator for the British secret service. He tore down the damaged rear portion of the upper story, put on a roof, and refurbished the interior. =The Brighton Hotel= In 1808 Rattoon sold the property to Richard M. Woodhull of New York City who converted it into a hotel called The Brighton. In addition to building a three-story wing, Woodhull added two stories to the main block. The smaller lintels of the third floor windows indicate the change. During the 1986 restoration, the attic chimneys revealed that the original roof had been only about eight feet lower than the present one. Woodhull replaced the huge front door, the outline of which is still distinguishable in the brick pattern. The massive brownstone steps were replaced with a two-story porch. A door leading to the second story of the porch replaced the Venetian window. Almost all of the present woodwork dates from the 1808-1809 period. It was then that the two handsome interior arches were constructed. The New York Gazette of May 27, 1809, described the Brighton Hotel as a \\"Charming Place, magnificent by nature and elegant by art.\\" =The Bruen House= The War of 1812 ruined the Brighton as a resort. In 1817, it was sold at sheriff's sale to Mathias Bruen, a Perth Amboy merchant who had become one of the wealthiest men in the nation. He resided there until his death in 1846. The Bruen heirs renovated the property and renamed it as the Brighton. Depression and interruptions caused by the Mexican and Civil Wars doomed the project. =The Westminster= In 1883 the Bruen family conveyed the property to the Presbyterian Board of Relief for Disabled Ministers and the Wives and Orphans of Deceased Ministers, where it was used as a home for the families of deceased ministers. After 20 years, the Presbytery returned the property to the Bruen family. In 1904, the family sold the property. Most of its eleven acres were divided into building lots, and Kearny Avenue was cut through. The house experienced a series of owners. Over the years it deteriorated from a comfortable apartment house with a public restaurant to a dilapidated rooming house and suspected flophouse. Restoration In 1914 a group of Perth Amboy citizens founded the Westminster Historical Society to raise funds to purchase and restore the Proprietary House. In the late 1930s, the house was measured and plans drawn by the Historical American Buildings Survey for a record of this significant property. The plans and photos are held by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Realizing that the importance of the property was as the Proprietary House and not as the Westminster, the Proprietary House Association was incorporated on September 7, 1966, to succeed the Westminster Historical Society. The State was persuaded to purchase the property, and it was placed on both the State and National Registers of Historic Places. Mainly with volunteer help, the Association cleaned out years of accumulated debris and removed walls which had divided the great rooms. The first two floors were open to visitors in 1976. Gradually, it became recognized that the Proprietary House is of state and national as well as local significance. However, the process of decay continually outpaced the process of restoration. Neither the Association or the State were able to pay for historically accurate restoration. In 1985 the Restoration Partnership of Boston, with William S. Pavlovsky as a principal, proposed a plan under which the Partnership would lease the house and 3.5 acres of surrounding land for 25 years. At its cost, the Partnership would restore and renovate the exterior, and finish the interior of the 1809 wing and the upper floors of the main block as offices. Income from the offices would reimburse the partnership. The plan was implemented in 1986. The ground and first floors of the original mansion are leased by the State to the Proprietary House Association, which is charged with raising funds for programming, interpretation, and historically accurate restoration. In late 2011 a historically accurate re-restoration began. Through paint analysis, soon each room on the first floor and basement levels will depict a colorful timeline of its many past occupants.

It was entered into the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. A violent and surrealistic mixture of farce and social commentary, its story was inspired by the real-life case of the Papin sisters. Plot Mich√®le and Marie-Louise (played by sisters Francine and Colette Berg√©) are alone in the country house owned by their employers, the Lapeyres. They have not been paid any wages for three years, but the Lapeyres have promised them ownership of the chicken-house attached to their property; now, however, they intend to sell it entirely, leaving the girls with nothing. Mich√®le and Marie-Louise argue, fight and make up, meanwhile allowing the house to fall into ruin. Suddenly the Lapeyres return, earlier than expected. The girls rebel, disobeying the Lapeyres and tormenting them, especially their adult daughter Elisabeth, who appears to have a lesbian attachment to Marie-Louise, though she is married. Her husband Philippe arrives, bringing with him buyers for the house; Mich√®le and Marie-Louise are cowed into submission and serve coffee while the deal is signed. Once this is done, however, they break out again, first locking themselves in the kitchen quarters then attacking Elisabeth and Mme Lapeyre and murdering them with a kitchen knife and a flat iron. The film ends with a caption, making explicit reference to the Papin sisters.

Since 1996, he has led the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI) in Port-au-Prince, which represents political prisoners, poor people, and victims of political violence. In 2006, The New York Times called Joseph \\"Haiti's most prominent human rights lawyer\\". Background Joseph received degrees from Haiti's √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and Gonaives Law School. He then worked on human rights cases for the Catholic Church's Peace and Justice Commission before joining the BAI in 1996. Raboteau Massacre Joseph was the lead lawyer for the victims in the prosecution of the BAI's most successful case, the Raboteau Massacre trial. The trial was described by a United Nations expert as \\"the longest and most complex\\" in the history of the Haitian judicial system. After six weeks of trial ending in November 2000, the Raboteau Massacre jury convicted 53 defendants for a 1994 attack on a pro-democracy neighborhood, 37 of whom were convicted in absentia. The Court also ordered that the defendants pay civil damages of 1 billion gourdes (roughly $43 million USD). Three former members of the military high command were later deported from the U.S. to Haiti to face charges in Raboteau, including former Assistant Commander-in-Chief Jean- Claude Duperval, who had worked at Disney World for five years after leaving Haiti. According to the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), Duperval was the highest-ranked soldier ever deported from the U.S. to face human rights charges. Joseph helped the Center for Justice & Accountability pursue other perpetrators of the Raboteau Massacre in U.S. courts. On 16 May 2008, these efforts resulted in a damage recovery of more than $400,000 USD from former Col. Carl Dor√©lien, who had recently won the Florida State Lottery. The same year, Joseph also provided an affidavit against Emmanuel Constant, a former paramilitary leader and convicted Raboteau perpetrator, when Constant was on trial for mortgage fraud in New York.  United Nations cholera lawsuit  In 2012, Joseph and IJDH Director Brian Concannon filed suit against the United Nations on behalf of victims of the 2010‚Äì2011 Haiti cholera outbreak, allegedly introduced to Haiti by UN troops in October 2010. According to the Haitian Health Ministry, as of August 2012, the outbreak had caused 7,490 deaths and caused 586,625 people to fall ill. Investigations by the New England Journal of Medicine and the US Centers for Disease Control pointed to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti base in Mirebalis as the source of the cholera outbreak. The UN denied responsibility, though epidemiological and genome studies appeared to have conclusively established the peacekeeping force's role, and UN Special Envoy Bill Clinton described the force as \\"the proximate cause of cholera\\". By challenging the legal immunity of peacekeepers, The Economist described the suit as a landmark case that could \\"affect peacekeeping operations worldwide\\". In August 2012, a Pulitzer Center reporter described the case as going \\"nowhere fast\\", though Joseph and Concannon intended to continue pursuing it. Joseph speaks about the case in the short documentary Baseball in the Time of Cholera, which won the 2012 Best Documentary Short Special Jury Mention at the Tribeca Film Festival. The case was dismissed by the Southern District of New York on the grounds of UN immunity, but has been appealed to the second circuit. Other cases In the late 1990s and early 2000s Joseph worked through the BAI on the Raboteau case as well as on various other cases aimed at bringing to justice ex-military and paramilitary death squad members. His activities and the activities of the BAI during this time period are discussed in more depth in a recently published book with Monthly Review Press. The activities of the BAI and the Haitian government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in seeking justice for the victims of paramilitary and military violence are documented in detail. He and the BAI were also tasked with helping to investigate the murder of famed radio journalist Jean Dominique and the security guard at Dominique's radio station. His view on how the case was exploited and manipulated to undermine the elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide is discussed in more depth in an interview with Joseph and attorney Brian Concannon. The interview is published in the journal of Haitian studies. Joseph represented Catholic Priest and human rights activist Fr. G√©rard Jean-Juste, who was designated a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International following his multiple arrests in 2004 and 2005. In January 2007, Joseph testified before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica, in the case of Yvon Neptune v. Haiti, the first Haitian case that the Court had considered. On 6 May, the Court ruled that the Haitian government had violated 11 provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights by keeping Neptune, a former prime minister, in detention and failing to try his case with sufficient speed. In 2010, Joseph and the BAI worked with a number of victims of sexual abuse in the IDP camps created following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In January 2012, Joseph spoke out against a ruling by a judge that former dictator Jean Claude Duvalier would be tried only for embezzlement and corruption charges, rather than human rights abuses. Joseph represents eight Duvalier victims in their civil complaint against Mr. Duvalier.  Threats and intimidation  Under Haiti's interim government (2004‚Äì2006), Joseph represented alleged political prisoners, including top former government officials, journalists and grassroots organizers. His advocacy generated frequent threats; his family was forced to leave the country, and Amnesty International issued an Urgent Action alert out of concern for his safety in November 2004. His family received political asylum from the U.S. and now resides in Miami. In late 2012, Joseph reported increasing levels of intimidation attempts against him and stated his belief that he was being targeted by the Haitian government. On 28 September, Jean Renel S√©natus, former Chief Prosecutor of Port-au-Prince, stated that he had been dismissed by the Ministry of Justice after refusing to order the arrest of 36 opposition activists, including Joseph. The reports caused Amnesty International to begin another \\"Urgent Action\\" letter-writing campaign on Joseph's behalf, calling on authorities to investigate the threats. The alleged intimidation was also protested by the Center for Justice and Accountability, the Center for Economic Policy and Research, the US National Lawyers Guild, US Congressman John Conyers, and the Center for Constitutional Rights. Awards and recognition In 2009, Joseph won the Katharine and George Alexander Law Prize from the Santa Clara University Law School, and the Judith Lee Stronach Human Rights Award from the Center for Justice & Accountability. He delivered the Judge Leon A. Higginbotham Human Rights Lecture at the University of Pennsylvania in November 2011, and was recognized by the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York in June 2012 for his \\"extraordinary work.\\" He delivered the commencement address in May, 2013 for graduates of the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.

It was convened by the British government who wished to agree up a schedule for the election of the next Holy Roman Emperor. All of the eight voting German electors were invited to attend, as was a representative of France. The Congress lasted, intermittently, from June until October 1752. The British wanted a swift election of their favoured candidate, the Austrian heir apparent Joseph, Duke of Lorraine. The British Secretary of State the Duke of Newcastle had travelled to the continent with George II of Great Britain to oversee the Congress. The French were represented by Count Vergennes a young diplomat. The British had agreed to pay some of the smaller electors subsidies in order to gain their votes. Saxony received a yearly payment of ¬£48,000. The French perceived this as an attempt to forge a pro-British alliance of the German states to create a military coalition in any future war. They saw the sudden British interest in the election as a smoke screen behind which they were advancing their own interests in Germany. In response France applied pressure on Austria to try to block the scheme while Vergennes attempted to appear co-operative with Newcastle at the Congress. The Congress finally concluded with the intention to elect the Austrian candidate. Aftermath Newcastle believed that the election of Joseph was sealed, but when he travelled to Vienna, he found the Austrians unwilling to proceed; they were using the requirement to forced to pay a small payment of money to the Palatine as justification for their refusal. The Austrians were preparing for a war with Prussia in which they would need France as allies and so they had no wish to risk offending it. They also attempted to appease the British by suggesting alternative candidates. Even when the British offered themselves to compensate the Palatines, Austria refused to agree. The Austrian rejection of the scheme was the beginning of the end for the longstanding Anglo-Austrian Alliance, which collapsed in 1756. Newcastle and his Austrophile allies in the British cabinet were severely weakened, and Newcastle was also personally disappointed at the failure of a scheme into which he had put so much effort. Joseph eventually became Holy Roman Emperor in 1765, following the Seven Years' War. The lack of Austrian interest in acquiring the throne demonstrated how dramatically less important the role was in the 18th century. Bibliography * Browning, Reed. The Duke of Newcastle.

Dewey Weber sculpture Hermosa Beach Community Center Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he distinguished himself with a surfing style unique at the outset of that era. Out of the water, he had already become a national yo-yo champion and a CIF champion in wrestling, then appeared in several feature films, and eventually established a successful surfboard manufacturing company. On November 14, 2015, the city of Hermosa Beach unveiled at its Community Center a sculpture inspired by a photo of Dewey Weber taken by surf photographer Leroy Grannis. Early years Weber was an only child in a German working-class family. He learned early about the water at his lifeguard-babysitter's nearby swimming pool. His father, Earl, was a truck driver. His mother, Gladys, worked at Denver's Nabisco cracker factory. When Weber was five, his family moved to Manhattan Beach, in California. When he was eight, his mother took him to an audition at which he won the part of Buster Brown, a comic book character adopted by the Brown Shoe Company. The local surf club included such relatively well-known surfers as Dale Velzy, Bob Hogan, and Barney Biggs, the last of whom noticed Weber first, and lent him a surfboard when Weber was only nine. When Weber was fourteen, Groucho Marx featured him, on his national television show You Bet Your Life, as the three-time National Duncan Yo-Yo Champion. Weber's short, stocky frame (5'3\\", 130 pounds) helped him to earn a varsity letter in wrestling in his very first year of high school. By the time Mira Costa High School graduated him in 1956, Weber had become a three-time CIF westling champion. He became an All-State performer at El Camino College, and although he subsequently qualified for the Olympic wrestling team, an injury immediately before the Olympic event prevented him from competing. Surfing Weber had caught the eye of one of the best-known surfers and surfboard makers of that time, Dale Velzy, who was one of the first to advertise his own surfboards by sponsoring surfers to ride them. During the time that Weber did so while seeking out surfing spots up and down the coast of California, his principal interest was finding a way to the surf in Hawaii. While he worked as a lifeguard at the Biltmore Hotel, he saved his money for his first trip to those islands. On his arrival he stayed in a two-room quonset hut there with some friends. Weber perfected his personal surfing style in Hawaii. His intricate footwork up and down the board, quite unlike the prevailing style, earned him the nickname, \\"The Little Man on Wheels.\\" Bud Browne's 1957 film, The Big Surf chronicled Weber's first visit to Hawaii. An image from that film of Weber surfing Makaha became the symbol of the United States Surfing Association. Weber appeared in nearly every surfing movie of the late 1950s and the 1960s, including Slippery When Wet (1958), Cat on a Hot Foam Board (1959), and Walk on the Wet Side (1963). Popular culture In the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti, Mackenzie Phillips' character, Carol, wears a white T-shirt with a Dewey Weber logo on it. In the film \\"Ford V Ferrari\\", a Dewey Weber store is seen across the street from main character Carol Shelby's car dealership set in Southern California's 1965. Business activities In 1960, following Weber's return to California from Hawai'i, he founded Weber Surfboards in Venice Beach, where he began producing boards with such names as the \\"Weber Performer\\" and the \\"Weber Pig.\\" Weber hired his highly regarded shaper, Harold Iggy, and assembled a surfing team, which he sent to surfing events attired in distinctive red Weber trunks and jackets to promote the Weber brand. The success of his surfing team led Weber Surfboards at the time to sales second only to Hobie. Between 1966 and 1967, Weber sold roughly 10,000 \\"Performers\\" throughout every coast in the country. Weber opened stores in Hermosa Beach, San Diego, and Honolulu. With the fall in popularity of the long board, the business eventually shrank to a single shop. Although Weber remained in the business and was best known for his longboard designs, he produced some short boards allegedly excellent too. In accord with his love of the ocean, he built a two-man swordfishing boat and spent much of his time at sea. He died on January 6, 1993, of heart failure. His death was widely reported in both the printed and the broadcast press. Weber's widow Caroline, and his sons Shea and Corey, revived the business together and continue to operate, in San Clemente.

After the French brig Palinure captured her, she was burned by the French to prevent her recapture. Career Carnation entered service at Plymouth in 1807 under Commander Charles Mars Gregory, who sailed her to the West Indies in 1808.Winfield (2008), p. 297. On 3 October, the French brig Palinure engaged Carnation northeast of Martinique. Gregory and all his officers were killed or wounded in the opening exchanges and Palinure‚Ä≤s crew attempted to board. Carnation‚Ä≤s crew were mustered to resist, but a Royal Marine sergeant named John Chapman refused the order and led over 30 men below decks to await capture. The remaining crewmen were outnumbered and had to surrender. Carnation had lost 10 killed and 30 wounded, perhaps half mortally; the French lost about 15 men killed and wounded. The French then took Carnation to Marin Bay, Martinique. The French commissioned Carnation on 31 January 1809 under the command of Ensign de vaisseau Simon-Auguste Huguet.Roche (2005), p.98. Huguet had distinguished himself in the engagement as Palinure's Capitaine de fr√®gate Pierre-Fran√ßois Jance had been debilitated by yellow fever and reportedly died within an hour of the victory after transferring to Carnation, which was the better vessel.James (1837), pp.311-3. Fate During the invasion of Martinique in January 1809, British troops landed close to where she was berthed. On 31 January 1809 her crew set Carnation on fire, destroying her.Gossett (1986), pp.86-7.Winfield and Roberts (2015), p.221. Postscript The British arrested Chapman and 31 of the crew who had deserted the deck during the battle. A court martial convicted them of cowardice; Chapman was hanged from the yardarm of the day after his sentence was passed. The others were sentenced to floggings and transportation as convicts to Botany Bay for 14 years, though it is not clear this part of their sentence was ever carried out.Hepper (1994), p.125. One man was acquitted. On 31 October 1808, the frigate encountered Palinure near Diamond Rock. A short engagement followed in which Circe captured Palinure. She had lost seven killed and eight wounded; Circe had lost one man killed and one wounded. The British took Palinure into service as HMS Snap.

Umkosi Wezintaba (The Regiment of the Hills), 1812‚Äì1899 Nongoloza (born Mzuzephi Mathebula) also known as Note, a Zulu African from Natal, worked for two criminals based on the Witwatersrand, Tyson and McDonald, assisting them with robbing passenger coaches or carts carrying miners' wages. Upon leaving his employers, Note sought out the area's Zulu-speaking thieves and criminals, eventually becoming their leader. Historian Charles van Onselen notes that although Umkosi Wezintaba mainly committed anti-social crimes, the organisation also worked to avenge perceived injustice against its members. Abas'etsheni (The People of the Stone) and Nongoloza, 1902‚Äì1906The Ninevites, 1906‚Äì1920 The Ninevites were formed by Mzuzephi 'Nongoloza' Mathebula.

Parker, first published in 1978. Plot summary A reclusive millionaire, Hugh Dixon, hires Spenser to find the nine members of a terrorist group that bombed a London restaurant where he and his family were dining, resulting in the deaths of his two daughters, his wife and leaving him a paraplegic. Spenser is promised USD$2,500 a head for the apprehension of each of the nine terrorists responsible, dead or alive. Spenser heads to London, England to start his investigation. Running an ad for information in The Times results in two assassination attempts on Spenser. Spenser foils the attempts resulting in the deaths of two gunmen and the capture of another. Spenser enlists the help of his friend Hawk, a powerful ally. Spenser tracks one of the members of the terrorist group, Liberty, and uses her as a Judas goat to lead him to other members. \\"Katherine,\\" the name she is operating under, flees to Copenhagen with Hawk and Spenser in pursuit. Spenser allows himself to be captured by Katherine's allies just to be rescued by Hawk before they can kill him. The rescue leads to the deaths of three more members of the group, but Katherine (also called Kathie) and the leader of the group, Paul, escape. The group turns out to be an anti-communist/white-supremacist group trying to keep control of African countries away from the native Africans and in the hands of white countries and leaders. The bombing of the restaurant Dixon and his wife were in was more or less a random act of violence against the United Kingdom because of its backing of black majority rule in Africa. Tired of running from Spenser and Hawk, Paul leaves the corpses of the last two members responsible for the bombing in Spenser and Hawk's hotel room. The last member, Kathie, is tied up on a bed. A note from Paul says these are the last members of the bombing, which was executed without his involvement. He couldn't kill Kathie because he had been intimate with her for some time. Hawk and Spenser untie Kathie and interrogate her, but she doesn't know where Paul has fled. Upon further reflection, she recalls he may be at the Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Even though his obligations to Dixon are completed, the three of them fly to Montreal and rent a private home near the games. That night Kathie tries to seduce Spenser, but he rebuffs her. Spenser flies to Boston to tell Dixon what is happening and asks him to assist them in stopping Paul. He tells Dixon he doesn't expect him to pay for it but Dixon insists on paying because he has great wealth but, since his family died, nothing worthwhile to spend it on. He also arranges to get Spenser tickets to the Olympic games. Spenser spends the night with his lover, Susan Silverman, and flies back to Canada the next day. With little to go on, Hawk, Spenser and Kathie attend the games at the Stadium looking for Paul and a huge man, a former weightlifter, who Kathie warns may be with him: Zachary. Spenser spots Paul on their second day and observes him setting up a mark for a sniper. The next day Spenser spots Paul, accompanied by Zachary, assembling a sniper rifle to shoot athletes during an Olympic medal ceremony as a terrorist act. All four men are armed, but Hawk quickly knocks out Paul. Zachary, a huge bodybuilder standing six foot seven and over three hundred pounds, attempts to shoot Spenser, but loses his gun in the scuffle. Trying to take down Zachary, the three remaining men all lose their weapons. Zachary flees the stadium pursued by Hawk and Spenser. He is eventually beaten into unconsciousness by them after a brutal fight a short distance from the stadium. The Montreal Police arrive and take Spenser and Hawk to a hospital. Spenser also has a broken left arm and nose; Hawk has a busted lip and one eye swollen shut. They learn Kathie shot Paul \\"as he attempted to flee,\\" but both know she shot him the first chance she got for abandoning her. When a Montreal police detective, Morgan, attempts to interrogate Spenser, he calls one of Dixon's men for instructions. It isn't long before Dixon arrives at the hospital and pays Spenser twice his promised fee, $50,000. Spenser offers half to Hawk, but he declines, just billing Spenser for his original fee ($150 per day plus expenses). Spenser lies to Dixon, saying Kathie is not part of the original nine responsible for the bombing and gets Dixon to have her released from jail. Dixon suspects the truth, but pays the fee anyway. The book concludes with Spenser and Susan vacationing together in London.

If a girl refused or vomited, the village weight-gain specialist might squeeze her foot between sticks, pull her ear, pinch her inner thigh, bend her finger backward or force her to drink her own vomit. In extreme cases, girls die, due to a burst stomach. The practice was known as gavage, a French term for force-feeding geese to obtain foie gras.\\" Especially prevalent in rural areas and having its roots in TuaregEncyclopedie Berbere: Gavage tradition, leblouh is practiced to increase chances of marriage in a society where high body volume used to be a sign of wealth. The practice is being done in several African countries, such as Mauritania, Niger, UgandaThe Price of Beauty, Episode 104, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia (specifically Jewish people), Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. The synonym gavage comes from the French term for the force-feeding of geese to produce foie gras. The practice goes back to the 11th century, and has been reported to have made a significant comeback in Mauritania after a military junta took over the country in 2008.Smith, Alex Duval. Girls being force-fed for marriage as junta revives fattening farms, The Observer, March 1, 2009. The younger generations of males in Mauritania now see fattening negatively. Older women called \\"fatteners\\" force the young girls to consume enormous quantities of food and liquid, inflicting pain on them if they do not eat and drink. One way of inflicting pain is to pinch a limb between two sticks. A six-year-old might typically be forced to drink of camel's milk, and eat two kilos of pounded millet mixed with two cups of butter, every day. Although the practice is abusive, mothers claim there is no other way to secure a good future for their children.Young Mauritanians reject forced fattening, Al Arabiya, February 24, 2009. A similar practice is referred to in a folktale entitled \\"The Tortoise with a Pretty Daughter\\", collected in Folk Stories from Southern Nigeria (1910). The folklorist who wrote down the story explained the treatment of the \\"pretty daughter\\": \\"The fatting house is a room where a girl is kept for some weeks before her marriage.

It is a sequel to the first Witcher novel Blood of Elves (Krew elf√≥w) and is followed by Baptism of Fire (Chrzest ognia). Plot Following their secret conclave (in Blood of Elves), the monarchs of the Northern Kingdoms are secretly preparing to create a pretext for war with Nilfgaard, not knowing that the Emperor of Nilfgaard is aware of their plans and preparing his own. Geralt consults with a lawyer, Codhringer, trying to discover the identity of the unknown mage trying to capture Ciri. At the same time, Yennefer takes Ciri from the Temple in Ellander to Gors Velen. Yennefer plans to enroll Ciri at the Aretuza school of magic on Thanedd Island, while attending a conference of mages there. While Yennefer is talking business with a dwarven banker in Gors Velen, she allows Ciri a day out to see the city, escorted by one of the banker's young employees. While viewing an exotic menagerie, Ciri inadvertently provokes a disturbance, and uses a magic amulet Yennefer gave to her in case of emergency. Doing so draws the attention of the mages Tissaia de Vries and Margarita Laux-Antille, the former and current (respectively) headmistresses of Aretuza, out hunting for truant students temporarily evicted from their quarters to make room for the visiting mages. While Yennefer, Tissaia and Margarita are discussing Ciri's upcoming education at Aretuza, Ciri, resistant to the idea of being \\"imprisoned\\" at school, steals a horse and rides to a nearby town where she heard Geralt is staying. Yennefer pursues her, leading to a reunion and reconciliation with Geralt. The three return to Thanedd island together. At an evening reception, Geralt meets several interesting individuals, including the mage Vilgefortz (who, unusually, earned his living as a soldier and mercenary before being trained in the use of magic). Vilgefortz suggests that Geralt could train to be a more powerful magic user, but the witcher is not interested. Vilgefortz also hints that a power struggle is imminent and that Geralt will have to choose sides. Vilgefortz wants Geralt on his side, but Geralt prefers to remain neutral. Dijkstra, the King of Redania's spymaster, also tries to recruit the witcher, without success. After the reception, Yennefer and Geralt retire to their room and re-connect on a more intimate level. Early in the morning, the witcher is awakened by the need to urinate, and walks to the courtyard, stumbling on an attempted coup. Philippa Eilhart, a sorceress in Redania's court, and Dijkstra have organized the coup, ambushing and binding several mages (including Vilgefortz), who they intend to bring before the conclave and accuse of conspiring with Nilfgaard; Emperor Emhyr wants the Chapter of Mages broken apart, since their participation at the Battle of Sodden Hill during the previous war led to the Empire's defeat. Unfortunately, Tissaia, the most senior mage, is furious that Phillippa and her other mages have abandoned their role as neutral advisors and peacemakers, instead aiding the Northern Kingdoms in fomenting war. Yennefer, also in attendance, has brought Ciri, who lapses into a clairvoyant trance and reveals that the war has already begun: the King of Redania was assassinated the night before, and the King of Aedirn has preemptively launched his attack on Nilfgaard. Refusing to believe Phillipa, Tissaia sides with Vilgefortz, releasing his bonds and dropping the field that inhibits the use of magic inside Aretuza to allow Vilgefortz to defend himself. This proves disastrous, when he and several other mages turn on Phillipa and the other Northern mages, while a Scoia'tael commando working with Nilfgaard invades the compound. Geralt disables Dijkstra and rushes in to rescue Yennefer and Ciri. In the ensuing chaos, Yennefer and Geralt fight off the Scoia'tael, while Ciri flees from the scene. At the head of the Scoia'tael she encounters the Black Rider from her nightmares of her escape from Cintra, but the Rider identifies himself to Geralt as Cahir, a Nilfgaardian soldier who actually saved Ciri's life by helping her escape the sack of Cintra. Vilgefortz confronts Geralt at the Tower of Gulls, where Ciri has taken refuge. Vilgefortz repeats his offer for Geralt to join the winning side, but Geralt refuses and a fight ensues in which Geralt is soundly defeated and severely wounded. Vilgefortz enters the Tower but Ciri escapes through an ancient and unstable magic portal, releasing a flare of energy that collapses the Tower and leaves Vilgefortz's face badly scarred. Tissaia finally realizes her mistake and, along with Triss Merigold's help, takes Geralt to safety, before committing suicide. Soon after the events at Thanedd Island, Dandelion finds Geralt recuperating in the forest of Brokilon, under the care of the dryads, and fills him in on recent events: Aedirn, Rivia, and Lyria fell quickly to the Nilfgaardian invaders, while King Foltest of Temeria made a hasty pact with Emhyr and preserved his kingdom; the elven mage Francesca Findabair was made the client queen of Dol Blathanna, but on the condition that she allow the Scoia'tael to remain under Emhyr's control. In Nilfgaard, a false Ciri is presented to Emhyr and he publicly announces his plans to marry her and legitimize his rule of Cintra, but after the official presentation, Emhyr orders his secret forces to find the real Ciri. Ciri awakes in the Korath desert and barely manages to stay alive, thanks to the help of a unicorn. When the unicorn is wounded in a fight with a burrowing desert creature, Ciri awakens her latent magical powers to heal it, but the power she taps into is so potent that she has visions of herself as an omnipotent avenger, ravaging the entire continent and taking revenge on all those who hunted or abandoned her, including Geralt and Yennefer. Horrified by the experience, she renounces the use of magic and does not resist when she is captured by bounty hunters in Nilfgaard's employ. She manages to escape them with the help of bandits known as the Rats. She feels safe and gains a sense of belonging among the Rats, who are refugees from the war as she is. She identifies herself to them as Falka, a dreaded witch from history who she saw in her vision, tempting her to take revenge. The story hints that Ciri, the last descendant of a Cintran royal line that carries elven blood, is the prophesied child who will destroy the old world and usher in a new age.

The story is based on Regina Kelly, a victim of Texas police drug enforcement tactics. Plot Set in the midst of the 2000 presidential election, American Violet tells the story of a young mother named Dee Roberts (Nicole Beharie), a 24-year-old African-American single mother of four living in the town of Melody (based on Hearne, Texas). One day, while Dee is working a shift at the local diner, the powerful local district attorney, Calvin Beckett (Michael O'Keefe), leads a group into the restaurant, sweeping Dee's housing project. The police drag Dee from work in handcuffs and dump her in the women's county prison. Indicted based on the uncorroborated word of a single and dubious police informant facing his own drug charges, Dee soon discovers she has been charged as a drug dealer. Even though Dee has no prior drug record and no drugs were found on her in the raid or any subsequent searches, she is offered a hellish choice: plead guilty and go home as a convicted felon or remain in prison and fight the charges, thus jeopardizing her custody and risking a long prison sentence for 18 to 24 years. Despite the urging of her mother (Alfre Woodard), and with her freedom and the custody of her children at stake, she chooses to fight the district attorney. Dee works with an ACLU attorney (Tim Blake Nelson) and a former local narcotics officer (Will Patton) to take on the Texas justice system. Cast *Nicole Beharie as Dee Roberts *Tim Blake Nelson as David Cohen *Will Patton as Sam Conroy *Michael O'Keefe as Calvin Beckett *Xzibit as Darrell Hughes *Malcolm Barrett as Byron Hill *Charles S. Dutton as Reverend Sanders *Alfre Woodard as Alma Roberts *Tim Ware as Mark Shelby *Lucinda Jenney as Leona Conroy *Karimah Westbrook as Claudia Johnson *Paul Guilfoyle as Judge Belmont *Anthony Mackie as Eddie Porter *Jerry Leggio as Norman Historical basis The film is based on the civil rights lawsuit Regina Kelly v. John Paschall, filed on behalf of 15 African-American residents of Hearne, Texas who were indicted in November 2000 on drug charges after being rounded up in a series of drug sweeps the ACLU referred to as \\"paramilitary\\". The lawsuit accused Paschall and the South Central Texas Narcotics Task Force of conducting racially motivated drug sweeps for more than 15 years in Hearne. In 2005, the ACLU and Robertson County settled and the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the individuals named in the suit, including Paschall. The fictional Harmon County represents Robertson County, Texas, where John Paschall was defeated for reelection in 2012. In 2016, Paschall surrendered his law license and pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misusing money that belonged to an estate for which he served as executor. He was required to spend 30 nights in jail, placed on 10 years' probation and issued a $1,000 fine. Regina Kelly continued to live in Hearne until 2009. Accuracy The film stays fairly close to the details of the actual case, although it changes all the characters' names and takes some liberties with the case's transcripts and other dialogue. The progress of the case in the film proceeds as the real case did, including the reduction of bail for the defendant, the dropping of charges, and the eventual resolution of the case, although the film makes no mention of the financial portion of the settlement. Some of the lawyers objected to the way they were portrayed. In the film, the public defender urges the character named Dee Roberts to accept a plea bargain. The actual public defender claims he never tells innocent clients to take a plea. Also, the actual lawyer who represented the District Attorney said the film was \\"more accurate than not,\\" but objected to how his behavior was portrayed in the film during the deposition of the chief plaintiff. In the film, the character questions the plaintiff about her sexual history. The actual lawyer claims the questions were routine questions about her children and their fathers, and did not delve any further into the subject. Also, the film shows the DA presiding over a hearing about custody of the defendant's children. Actually, the DA was present and spoke at the hearing, but did not determine custody. The revelation during the film's climax, which led to the resolution of the case, was presented accurately, including the race of the deposing lawyer and the identity of the video witnesses, but the DA did not use the word \\"uppity\\" to describe the African- American lawyer who was deposing him. And the actual legal team for the plaintiffs was much larger, consisting of about 25 lawyers, from a private law firm, working pro bono. Critical reception American Violet holds a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 6.69/10. Clay Kane said that American Violet is \\"the first must-see film for African-Americans in 2009.\\" Dr. Joy Browne of WOR Radio reviewed the film, calling it \\"A gem of a movie. Timely, thought-provoking, passionate, exciting. Everything you look for in a movie experience and more.\\" Rex Reed of The New York Observer said that the film is \\"a rich, vibrant narrative film guaranteed to move everyone who sees it.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars and commented that \\"Nicole Beharie delivers a stunning performance.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Frontline's documentary The Plea * ACLU Press Release] * on Dallas Morning News Category:2008 films Category:American legal drama films Category:American films Category:American courtroom films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Teddy Castellucci Category:Films about drugs Category:Films set in 2000 Category:Films set in Texas ","title":"American Violet"},{"id":"21705791","text":"Latvijas Radio (LR) is Latvia's national public-service radio broadcasting network.

He was also the first judge to hold the position of Recorder of Dublin.The Irish Nation: Its History and Its BiographyA Few Arguments on the Subject of Saffron Life He was the son of Nicholas Stanihurst, Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1542. He was Speaker of the Irish House of Commons in the Parliaments of 1557, 1560, and 1568. At the opening of each session he delivered an oration. He proved himself a supporter of Protestantism under Elizabeth I of England, and contrived the passing through the Commons of the Act of Uniformity passed in England the year before, in 1560, putting the question when its chief opponents were absent from the chamber. On the other hand, his friendship with Edmund Campion suggests that like many of the Anglo-Irish gentry he retained a certain sympathy with the Roman Catholic faith. In 1570 he recommended to Parliament, in a speech which he delivered at the prorogation, a system of national education for Ireland, proposing the establishment of grammar schools throughout the country. At the same time he suggested the formation of at Dublin such as was inaugurated by the foundation of Trinity College Dublin a few years later. The speech is said to have been printed. Stanyhurst's educational policy was not accepted by the government, although Sir Henry Sidney, to whom he was close, strongly supported it. Edmund Campion, who acted as tutor to his son Richard, was also a good friend, and acknowledged assistance from Stanihurst in writing his history of Ireland. On one occasion Stanihurst, despite outwardly professing the Protestant faith, saved Campion from arrest on the charge of being a Jesuit by sending him to the home of the Barnewall family of Turvey House, who were staunch Catholics. He died at Dublin on 27 December 1573, aged 51. A Latin elegy by his son Richard was printed in the latter's description of Ireland, as well as in the appendix to his translation of Virgil. Family He married Anne Fitzsimon of Dublin and had five children. Richard Stanihurst was their eldest son, and they left another son, Walter, who translated into English Innocent, de Contemptu Mundi. His daughter Margaret married Arnold Ussher, one of the six clerks of the Court of Chancery (Ireland), and was mother of James Ussher.

England and Wales This offence was created by section 15 of the Theft Act 1968. Sections 15(1) and (2) of that Act read: This offence replaced the offence of obtaining by false pretences, contrary to section 32(1) of the Larceny Act 1916.Griew, Edward. The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. Fifth Edition. Sweet and Maxwell. 1986. Paragraph 6-02 and note 2 at page 117. Paragraph 6-08 and note 15 at page 120. Section 15 was repealed on 15 January 2007 by Schedule 3 to the Fraud Act 2006 =Liability for offences by corporations= Section 18 of the Theft Act 1968 applied in relation to section 15. =Going equipped for cheat= In section 25 of the Theft Act 1968, the word \\"cheat\\" meant an offence under section 15.The Theft Act 1968, section 25(5) =By any deception= The deception must be the operative cause of the obtaining of property, and this is a question of fact for the jury to decide, requiring proof that the victim would not have acted in the same way had they known the truth. In R v LavertyR v Laverty [1970] 3 All ER 432, 54 Cr App R 435, [1971] RTR 124, CA although the defendant put new number plates and a new chassis number on a car, the victim bought the car because he thought Laverty was the owner. There was no proof that the false identification plates were the cause of the obtaining. This would suggest that if the victim admits not caring whether the defendant's representation was true or false, an acquittal must follow. But, in Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Charles,Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Charles [1977] AC 177, [1976] 3 WLR 431, [1976] 3 All ER 112, 63 Cr App R 252, [1977] Crim LR 615, HL, sub nom Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis v Charles. a causal link was implied even though the victim admitted not considering the question of whether the bank would or would not honour the cheque. Similarly, in R v Talbott (1995) CLR 396 the defendant gave false details and obtained housing benefit. She was actually entitled to the benefit, but causation was established by the fact that the benefit officer would not have paid her if she had known the defendant was lying. This \\"constructive\\" deception is necessitated because many shop assistants and officials may be personally indifferent as to whether the defendant is honest or not. To clarify this aspect of the law, the Law Commission recommend the introduction of a specific offence to cover the use of cheque guarantee and payment cards to remove the need for any implied representation to affect the mind of the particular person accepting the use of the card. This would identify the bank as the true victim. The deception must precede the obtaining of property. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Ray,Director of Public Prosecutions v Ray [1974] AC 370, [1973] 3 WLR 359, [1973] 3 All ER 131, 117 SJ 663, 58 Cr App R 130, sub nom Ray v Sempers [1974] Crim LR 181, HL, reversing sub nom Ray v Sempers [1973] 1 WLR 317 the defendant had already obtained the meal before he made the representation. This is an issue of causation so that it can be shown that the deception operated on the mind of the person alleged to be deceived. In R v Coady (1996) CLR 518, the defendant went to two self-service petrol stations. In the first, he served himself and then told the attendant to charge his employer which he was not entitled to do. In the second, he may have made this representation to the attendant before petrol was released to the pump. The convictions were quashed because there was no evidence that the first representation came before the obtaining of the petrol and the judge had failed to direct on the requirement that the deception operate on the mind of the attendant in respect of the second representation. Further, the deception must not be too remote from the obtaining, and/or there must be no break in the chain of causation. In R v ButtonR v Button [1900] 2 QB 597, 69 LJQB 901, 83 LT 288, 16 TLR 525, 64 JP 600, 48 WR 703, 44 SJ 659, 19 Cox 598 the defendant falsely represented that he was not a good runner and so obtained a better handicap than he deserved for the race which he won. He was arrested as he attempted to collect the prize but the deception merely gave him the opportunity to run from an advantageous position, whereas the cause of the attempt to collect the prize was that he had won the race. The deception must operate on a human mind for the causation element to be proved. The fact that a machine may respond to the insertion of a coin, card or token, or that a computer may give a programmed response to data entry does not amount to a section 15 offence, but the defendant can be charged with theft, contrary to section 1, of any property obtained. The Law Commission recommend the creation of a new offence to cover this possibility. =Dishonestly= The wording of the statute is highly significant because it is by a deception dishonestly and not by a dishonest deception which requires the dishonesty to be proved separately from the deception. Otherwise the dishonesty would be implied by the fact that the deception was made knowingly: see R v Greenstein.R v Greenstein, R v Green [1975] 1 WLR 1353, 119 SJ 742, [1976] 1 All ER 1, sub nom R v Greenstein (Allan), R v Green (Monty), 61 Cr App R 296, [1975] Crim LR 714, CA However, section 2 of the Theft Act 1968 does not apply to section 15 although the test derived from R v Ghosh [1982] QB 1053 may apply if the defendant claims to believe that he acted in a way matching the ordinary person's idea of honesty, i.e. a defendant will be dishonest where he realised that he was doing something that reasonable and honest people would regard as dishonest. But R v PriceR v Price (R W), 90 Cr App R 409, [1990] Crim LR 200, CA held that this test was both unnecessary and potentially misleading in the majority of cases. The Law Commission has debated whether the requirement to prove dishonesty makes obtaining a conviction more difficult, and whether the law should be reformed to make the offences conduct based. The conclusion was that juries are not confused by the need to consider dishonesty as a separate element from deception and that this aspect of the law does not need reform. =Obtains= In most cases, the defendant will obtain ownership, possession, and control of the property, but the obtaining of any one of these will be sufficient. So, under the Sale of Goods Act, title to goods may pass before possession or control is delivered, or possession may pass before title, or the defendant may obtain control alone, depending on the wording of the contract. Usually, the defendant will be acting in their own right to obtain the goods, but the offence is also committed where the defendant obtains property for another or enables another to obtain or retain. Thus, the offence might be committed where the \\"victim\\" is induced to transfer ownership of property to another or to agree not to enforce his right to recover goods from that other. In R v SewardR v Seward [2005] EWCA Crim 1941 (11 July 2005) the defendant was acting as the \\"front man\\" in the use of stolen credit cards and other documents of identification to obtain goods. This was a role not unlike that of the \\"mule\\" in drug importation cases because the front man takes the risk of going into shops where CCTV cameras may clearly identify him. He obtained goods to the value of ¬£10,000 for others who were unlikely ever to be identified. The Court of Appeal considered sentencing policy for deception offences involving \\"identity theft\\"an increasingly common phenomenon. The defendant had a drug problem and it was argued that a drug treatment and testing order might be the more appropriate response, but the court concluded that a prison sentence was required. Henriques J. said at para 14: =Property= Section 34(1) of the Theft Act 1968 confirms that the definition given in section 4(1) applies, so property is: But the limitations on what can be stolen in sections 4(2) to 4(4) do not apply to section 15. It is therefore possible to obtain land by a deception. =Belonging to another= For these purposes, section 34(1) applies section 5(1) to the section 15 offence, so: =Intention to permanently deprive= The extended meaning given to \\"intention permanently to deprive\\" the other of the property given in section 6 of the Theft Act 1968 applies to section 15. =Problem resolved= The offence of obtaining a money transfer by deception, contrary to section 15A of the Theft Act 1968, was specifically enacted to remove the problem caused by R v Preddy and Slade, R v Dhillon.R v Preddy and Slade, R v Dhillon [1996] AC 815, [1996] 3 All ER 481, [1996] 3 WLR 255, (1996) 2 Cr App R 524, HL, (10 July 1996) reversing R v Preddy and Slade [1995] Crim LR 564, CA, and R v Dhillon, unreported, CA This case held that there no section 15 offence was committed when the defendant caused transfers between the victim's and his own bank account by deception. This arises because of the legal relationship between a bank and its customer. The account is a chose in action, i.e. a debt owed by the bank to the customer or vice versa. Thus, when the \\"transfer\\" took place, one debt owed by the bank to its client was reduced, and a second debt in the same amount was created, Thus, nothing formerly belonging to the victim was obtained by the defendant. Northern Ireland This offence was created by section 15 of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. That section was repealed on 15 January 2007The Fraud Act 2006 (Commencement) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/3200 (C.112)), article 2 by sections 14 and 15(1) and (4) of, and paragraph 1(c)(i) of Schedule 1 to, and Schedule 3 to, the Fraud Act 2006, subject to the transitional provisions and savings in paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 to that Act. Visiting forces This offence was an offence against property for the purposes of section 3 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952.The Visiting Forces Act 1952, section 3(6) and Schedule, paragraph 3(g) (as inserted by the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, Schedule 3, Part III) References *Allen, Michael.

Summary The Spook Who Sat by the Door is set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in the Chicago of Mayor Richard J. Daley. The story begins with Senator Hennington, a white, liberal senator who is facing a tight re-election vote, and so is looking for ways to win the Negro vote. His wife suggests that he accuse the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of racial discrimination, because the Agency has no black officers. Consequent to Senator Hennington's investigation, which assured a comfortable re-election, the CIA is required, for political reasons, to recruit Black Americans for training as case officers. Only Dan Freeman, secretly a black nationalist, successfully completes the training; of his recruitment class, he earned the highest grades and best marks for athleticism. Stationed in South Korea during the Korean War (1950‚Äì53), Freeman is an expert in hand-to-hand combat, especially judo; and played football at Michigan State University. Having become the first black man in the Central Intelligence Agency, Freeman is given a desk job ‚Äì Section Chief of the Top Secret Reproduction Center. Freeman understands that he is the token black man in the CIA, and that the CIA defines his presence as proof of the Agency's commitment to racial integration and social progress. When used as a \\"model Negro\\", and tasked to appear and speak at social and official events, he tells the story the audience wishes to hear. He has a distaste for the \\"snob-ridden\\", political world of Washington D.C., and especially the city's black middle class. Therefore, after completing his training in guerrilla warfare, weaponry, communications, and subversion, Freeman continues working at the CIA long enough to avoid raising suspicion about his motives for resigning from the CIA; and then returns to Chicago to work providing social services to black people. On returning to the city, Freeman communicates with the Cobras, a street gang previously immune to appeals from social-service agencies. Immediately, he begins recruiting young black men from the ghettoes of Chicago, the \\"inner-city\\", to become Freedom fighters, by teaching them the guerrilla warfare skills and tactics he learned with the CIA. The Cobras' training includes a fight with the Comanches, a rival street gang; the study and appreciation of black poetry, music, and revolutionary leaders; a bank robbery on 115th and Halstead streets; and the robbery of a National Guard Armory on Cottage Grove Avenue. The Cobras have become a guerrilla group, with Dan Freeman as the secret leader, and, by means of violent and non-violent actions, set out to ensure that black people truly live freely in Chicago and the US. The \\"Freedom Fighters\\" of Chicago begin propaganda operations to tell the public about their guerrilla warfare throughout the US. To his guerrillas, Freeman says, \\"What we got now is a colony, what we want is a new nation.\\" As armed revolt and war of liberation occur throughout the poor neighbourhoods of Chicago, the Illinois National Guard and the Chicago police desperately try to stop the black Freedom Fighters. Learning the operational and tactical flaws of the National Guard's \\"sloppily trained and ill-disciplined\\" units, Freeman and the Freedom Fighters escalate their urban warfare in Chicago. First, they blow up the office of the mayor in the new City Hall building. Secondly, they paint a Negro alderman's car yellow and white. Thirdly, they take over radio stations and broadcast propaganda from \\"the Freedom Fighters, the Urban Underground of Black Chicago.\\" Fourthly, they kidnap Colonel \\"Bull\\" Evans, the commander of the Illinois National Guard unit, drug him with LSD, and then release him. After the Freedom Fighters start sniper attacks, killing National Guardsmen, Dan Freeman is visited by three old friends, two women and a man. After speaking with his female friends, Freeman's final guest is Dawson, a friend and also a Chicago police sergeant. Suspicious of Freeman, Sergeant Dawson had secretly entered Freeman's apartment; his suspicion was verified when he found Freedom Fighter propaganda. After an argument, Freeman attacks Dawson and kills him. He then calls the ranking Freedom Fighters to dispose of Dawson's body. The story closes with Freeman ordering \\"Condition Red\\", which order activates guerrilla attack-teams in 12 cities throughout the USA.  Title and background  The title of the novel, The Spook Who Sat by the Door, refers to a public-relations practice, in the early days of racial affirmative action in US society, whereby the first Black person hired by a company would be placed in an office that was close to and visible from the entrance of the business, so that everyone who entered could see that the company had a racially mixed staff of employees. The word spook has a dual meaning in the title of the novel: (i) as a racial slur for a Black person, and (ii) as an intelligence-agency jargon word for a spy.Wanda Macon, \\"The Spook Who Sat by the Door\\", Oxford Companion to African American Literature, 1997, p. 327.Richard Guzman, \\"Sam Greenlee: Spooks Sitting by Doors\\", Richard R. Guzman, 20 February 2015. \\"My experiences were identical to those of Freeman in the CIA,\\" Greenlee, a former US Army officer and United States Information Agency officer told The Washington Post in 1973. \\"Everything in that book is an actual quote. If it wasn't said to me, I overheard it.\\"Matt Schudel, \\"Sam Greenlee: US novelist whose time in the Foreign Service informed the book and cult film 'The Spook Who Sat by the Door'\\", The Independent, 26 May 2014. The Spook Who Sat by the Door is a critical reflection upon the racism, violence, and oppression lived by African Americans in the United States. As such, the novel is a manual on how to be a successful revolutionary, by beating The System at their own game.Charles D. Peavy, \\"Four Black Revolutionary Novels, 1899‚Äì1970\\", Journal of Black Studies 1 (December 1970), p. 222. The character of \\"Dan Freeman\\" demonstrates the importance of co-operation among oppressed peoples in fighting for equality and freedom.Lottie L. Joiner, \\"After 30 years, a Controversial Film Re-Emerges\\", The Crisis, November/December 2003, p. 41. About the publication of the novel and the release of the film The Spook Who Sat by the Door (1973), directed by Ivan Dixon, Greenlee said: Close collaboration between film director Ivan Dixon and screenplay writer Sam Greenlee realised a cinematic representation that did not lose or lessen the strong social analyses and encouragement to revolution in the novel. Historical context The political atmosphere of the United States was especially restless in 1969, the year of publication of The Spook Who Sat by the Door, because the contentious politics for civil rights, for women's rights, and for gay rights movements had become visible in the public sphere. Sociologically, it is suggested that the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) ‚Äì whose symbol was a seven-headed cobra ‚Äì were influenced in their choice of name by Greenlee's use, in the novel, of the word symbiology, a term derived from the biological term symbiosis, which describes disparate organisms living together in a mutually beneficial relationship.Michael Newton, \\"Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA)\\", Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2002. American History Online (accessed 5 November 2012).Al Ellenberg, Introduction to Abduction: Fiction Before Fact, Grove Press, 1974. The original UK book-jacket for The Spook Who Sat by the Door carried endorsements by the political activist Dick Gregory, who called the novel \\"an important, original, nitty-gritty book\\"; by the novelist Len Deighton, who said that the book would \\"cause many readers great annoyance ‚Äì and, what more can a writer ask, than that?\\"; and by the writer Stephen Vizinczey, who said the story is \\"in the manner of the best thrillers, the hero's life is always in danger, and there are women about who undress with passion, but might give him away. Still, there is more at stake than the hero's life or the reader's entertainment ‚Äì this first-class thriller is also a genuine novel, which is not only exciting, but moving, as it unfolds the black man's dream, the white man's nightmare.\\"Jacket of Allison & Busby hardback edition, London, UK, 1969. In Britain the novel's publication by Allison and Busby received much critical attention, including extracts in The Observer; however, Sam Greenlee later noted: \\"In contrast to more than one hundred reviews in Britain, most of them favourable, my novel was all but ignored by the American literary establishment.\\"Sam Greenlee, \\"1.

It was founded in 1991 by UW Professor Joel Rogers. The organization says that its core values are democracy, sustainability and equality. Activities The earliest efforts of COWS were directed at workforce development in Wisconsin and rust- belt states that were losing manufacturing jobs. Since 1996, the center has published a biennial report, The State of Working Wisconsin, that quantifies and analyzes trends in that state's workforce. COWS supports raising the minimum wage. The organization has worked with the Service Employees International Union, Wisconsin Jobs Now and the Economic Policy Institute on efforts to raise the minimum wage. The focus of COWS has expanded to include a number of separate projects aimed at government leaders across the nation who can affect policy in their regions. With Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, COWS co-founded the Mayors Innovation Project. It later added the Center for State Innovation. Both projects are aimed at helping elected officials pursue progressive policies. COWS also helped launch organizations like the Apollo Alliance and the Economic Analysis Research Network (EARN). In 2012 it started the American Legislative and Issue Campaign (ALICE) to write and promote model legislation from a progressive perspective. ALICE was intended to serve as a progressive counterpoint to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Funding COWS is mainly supported by government grants and foundations.

He is best known for his appearances accompanying his son-in-law Doc Watson during the folk music revival of the 1960s. While not recorded before the folk revival, Carlton had been playing with some of the region's most well-known musicians-- such as Al Hopkins, G. B. Grayson, and Clarence Ashley-- since the 1920s.Ralph Rinzler, \\"Biographical Notes.\\" In Clarence Ashley and Doc Watson: The Original Folkways Recordings, 1960-1962 [CD liner notes]. Smithsonian Folkways, 1994. Carlton was born in Wilkes County, North Carolina in 1901. His father was an accomplished local musician, and the family often played at church events and other gatherings. In 1960, folk music producer Ralph Rinzler \\"rediscovered\\" Clarence Ashley at the Union Grove Fiddler's Convention, and offered to re-record Ashley at Ashley's home in Shouns, Tennessee. Ashley invited Carlton, Doc Watson (who was married to Carlton's daughter Rosa Lee Carlton), and several other bandmates to join in the sessions, which took place on Labor Day weekend in 1960. Carlton accompanied Watson and Ashley to a recording session in Saltville, Virginia the following year, and to subsequent recording sessions and folk festivals throughout the remainder of the decade. He died at his home in Deep Gap, North Carolina in 1972. Carlton played banjo in the frailing style similar to Ashley. His fiddle style resembles that of his friend G.B. Grayson and Gid Tanner. His banjo recordings include \\"Rambling Hobo\\", which Rinzler described as reminiscent of Carlton's \\"peaceful, centered nature\\", and \\"Old Ruben\\", which he learned from his brother. His fiddle recordings include \\"I'm Going Back to Jericho\\", which he recalled learning from a neighbor, and \\"Handsome Molly\\", which he learned from G.B. Grayson.

Miles and Monica also have a younger sister, Bliss (Claire Yarlett). The Colbys season one In The Colbys, Monica is a lawyer working for her father Jason's company, Colby Enterprises. In the series premiere, \\"The Celebration\\", she offers to investigate who is behind detrimental rumors which are plaguing the company, but Jason dismisses her. An angry Monica complains to Sable, who tells Monica that it is unlikely Jason will ever treat her like he would a man. In \\"Conspiracy of Silence\\", Monica warns Miles that things will likely change between him and Fallon if she gets her memory back. Monica tries to convince her cousin Jeff Colby (John James) to let his ex-wife Fallon go, since she and Miles are in love, in \\"Moment of Truth\\". Monica offers to help Jason again in \\"Family Album\\", but is forced to accept that her father only takes men seriously. Blake Carrington's half-sister, Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll), asks Monica to help her learn if Jason is the one buying up stock in her company, Titania Records. Monica learns that Dominique's ex- lover, Garrett Boydston (Ken Howard), bought the stock. Dominique offers Monica a job leading her company. Feeling unappreciated, Monica quits Colby Enterprises to manage Titania in \\"Shadow of the Past\\". Jason is hurt, but Monica is sick of being treated like a decoration rather than a valued employee. In accepting the job, Monica has run afoul of Titania vice president Neil Kittredge (Philip Brown), who was demoted to make way for her. Dominique is annoyed to find Monica and Neil clashing at work in \\"The Reunion\\". Worried about Constance, Monica confronts Hutch, who has no idea that Constance is wealthy and breaks things off with her. Monica is doubtful in \\"Fallen Idol\\" when Miles tells her he witnessed Jason in a romantic embrace with Jeff's mother and Sable's sister, Francesca (Katharine Ross). Monica apologizes to Constance for interfering with Hutch in \\"Fallen Idol\\", and goes to Hutch to ask that he reconcile with Constance. Monica meets blind singer Wayne Masterson (Gary Morris) and pitches him to Neil, which leads to another argument between them. Monica and Neil get closer in \\"The Letter\\", as she and Wayne begin working together. Neil apologizes to Monica in \\"The Turning Point\\". They fly to San Francisco for dinner, and end up spending the night together. Thanks to Monica, Hutch reconciles with a recovering Constance in \\"Thursday's Child\\". Neil is jealous of Monica's relationship with Wayne. In \\"The Pact\\", Monica learns from Dominique that Neil is married. In \\"Fallon's Choice\\", Monica tries to talk Miles out of renewing his pursuit of Fallon, who has moved on with Jeff. When Neil complains about her closeness to Wayne, Monica explodes with her discovery that Neil has a wife. As Wayne prepares to have an operation that could restore his sight, Monica fires Neil in \\"The Trial\\". In \\"Burden of Proof\\", Jason reveals in court that he is Jeff's father, making Jeff the half-brother of Monica, Miles, and Bliss. With Jeff and Fallon planning to marry in Los Angeles, Monica is worried when Miles refuses to get away to New York in \\"My Father's House\\". She works out her argument with Wayne. Dominique compels Monica to rehire Neil in \\"The Outcast\\". When Miles is arrested for murder, Monica tells Wayne in \\"The Honeymoon\\" that she cannot be with him when he has his surgery. Monica laments to Sable that Miles seems to be pushing her away. Monica and Neil resume their affair in \\"Double Jeopardy\\", and he tells her he is going to ask his wife for a divorce. After visiting Miles in jail, Monica is worried he is hiding something. In \\"A Family Affair\\", Constance asks Monica about the relevance of audio tapes in court. Miles confides in Monica that he cannot be sure whether he committed the murder or not, but she believes him incapable of murder. She helps him try to regain his memories in \\"The Reckoning\\", and worries when he vanishes and appears to jump bail. Wayne tells Monica that he can see again. In \\"Anniversary Waltz\\", Neil reassures Monica that he will divorce his wife, and gives her a key to his apartment. Wayne leaves Titania Records and Los Angeles when he realizes what is going on between Monica and Neil. Monica catches Neil in bed with his wife in the season finale \\"Checkmate\\". Devastated, she flees by plane, only to crash in the mountains. The Colbys season two Monica has survived the plane crash in the season two premiere \\"The Gathering Storm\\". Dominique tells Monica of her intent to sell Titania Records in \\"No Exit\\". Dominique sells Titania Records and her hotel to Jason's enemy, Zach Powers (Ricardo Montalb√°n), prompting Monica to quit in \\"Jason's Choice\\". When Jason throws Sable out of the mansion and she collapses, Monica and her siblings convince Jason to allow their mother to stay. In \\"The Matchmaker\\", Jason is angry with Monica that he had to hear about her plane crash from his insurance agent. Not ready to talk about Neil, Monica is pleasantly surprised when Jason asks her to come back as General Counsel of Colby Enterprises. Finally feeling appreciated, she accepts. In \\"Something Old, Something New\\", Monica opens up to Jason about Neil, and explains that she was unhappily involved with another married man in the past. Jason is compelled to work with Senator Cash Cassidy (James Houghton), the son of an old business rival, as Jason's government liaison for a proposed space satellite project. Monica is thrown when Cash comes to Sable's party, as Cash is the married man with whom Monica had an affair in college. Though he had previously ended their relationship to preserve his political career, Cash wants to reconnect in \\"The Gala\\". Monica rebuffs him, insisting it is over between them. She tells her father she does not want to work with Cash, but Jason forces the issue. Monica waffles when Cash asks her why she left him eight years ago. As Jason warns Cash away from Monica, she goes to Arthur, fearful that Cash will discover that she had his child. In \\"Bloodlines\\", Jason wants Cash off the project, but Monica does not want him removed because of her. Cash is grateful for her support, but Cash's wife Adrienne (Shanna Reed) warns Monica that she will fight hard to keep her husband. Monica insists that her relationship with Cash is long dead. Cash confesses that he still loves Monica in \\"Deceptions\\", but she rejects him. He is persistent, and insists that his marriage has fallen apart. With Monica's resistance losing strength, Miles advises her to protect her own interests. In \\"And Baby Makes Four\\", Monica meets and befriends Scott, (Coleby Lombardo), Cash's young son with his wife Adrienne, not realizing that he is the child Monica conceived with Cash and put up for adoption. Adrienne forbids Cash from ever telling Monica the truth, reminding him that she only agreed to adopt her rival's baby because Constance threatened to have Cash removed from the Senate. When Cash spends time with Scott and Monica in \\"Bid for Freedom\\", Adrienne goes to Jason to remove Cash from the project, but Jason refuses to interfere in personal matters. Cash almost tells Monica the truth. Zach confronts Cash in \\"Reaching Out\\", threatening to reveal Scott's true parentage to Monica unless Cash spies for him. Cash refuses, deciding to tell Monica himself. Before he is able to, Adrienne confronts Monica and inadvertently says something that makes Monica suspicious. When Arthur is unable to tell her what happened to her son, Monica calls Constance, who confirms that Scott is indeed her child. When Cash arrives to confess, Monica scorns him for not telling her sooner and sends him away. While Monica's discovery gives her nightmares in \\"Sanctuary\\", Zach tells Sable that Monica is Scott's mother. Sable advises Monica not to tell Jason yet. In \\"Power Plays\\", Sable goes behind Monica's back and tries to convince Adrienne to give up Scott as a means to give Jason his first grandchild. Adrienne refuses and lashes out at Monica, who warns an indignant Sable to stay out of her private life. Cash tells Monica he wants her to make a family with him and Scott. In \\"The Legacy\\", Cash and Adrienne's marriage is collapsing, and an intoxicated Adrienne tells Scott it is Monica's fault. Monica is thrown when an angry Scott appears at her office and returns the magazines she gave him. Sable suggests that Monica tell Jason the truth about Scott in \\"The Home Wrecker\\", but Monica recognizes her mother's self-serving motives and forbids Sable from telling Jason. Cash decides to leave Adrienne and marry Monica. She declines for Scott's sake, but Scott runs away from home. Adrienne goes to the Colby mansion and tells Jason and Frankie that Monica's son Scott is missing. In \\"The Manhunt\\", Monica and Cash arrive at the Colby mansion and learn that Scott is missing and Jason knows about him. Monica guesses correctly that Scott is at the observatory, but when they find him he says he hates Monica. Adrienne promises Cash that he will lose Scott if he leaves her. Sable tries to convince Cash and Monica that Scott will be better off away from Adrienne, who has had addiction issues and made suicide attempts. Cash takes a bullet meant for Jason. Cash is in critical condition in \\"All Fall Down\\", and while he is in surgery Scott tells Monica that he did not mean it when he said he hated her. A recovering Cash asks for Monica, who is relieved he survived. She and Sable finally discuss Monica's pregnancy and Scott's birth in \\"Guilty Party\\". In \\"Fallon's Baby\\", Adrienne tells Cash that she is taking Scott back to Washington, but Cash and Monica again refuse Sable's interference. Scott blames himself for the failure of Cash and Adrienne's marriage. Cash tries to disabuse him of this notion, but ultimately tells Monica they cannot be together because he does not want to hurt Scott. In \\"Answered Prayers\\", Monica and Miles are worried that Sable plans to marry Zach. Monica is happy for Jason and Frankie that they are getting married, but sad about her hopeless situation with Cash. In \\"Return Engagement\\", Monica inadvertently stops Sable from marrying Zach with the news that presumed-dead Philip Colby (Michael Parks), Frankie's ex-husband and Jeff's father, has returned. Zach, spurned again by Sable, suggests to Adrienne that they help each other with their problems. Monica confronts Adrienne about her connection to Zach in \\"Devil's Advocate\\", Scott overhears, and learns that Monica is his mother. Monica hears Philip speaking Chinese to someone on the phone to whom he owes $2 million. Understanding everything, Monica informs Jason. In \\"Betrayals\\", Monica feels terrible about how Scott found out he is her son. Cash tells her that Zach tried to blackmail him about Scott, and Monica informs Sable, who is furious. Scott declares his loyalty to Adrienne, who tells Sable she is leaving town with Scott to get him away from the Colbys. Adrienne tells Cash he can have a divorce but not Scott, assuring him that a messy trial would hurt the satellite project as well as his and Monica's reputations. Monica realizes that the only way to give Scott a stable home is to end her relationship with Cash. Lucas Carter (Kevin McCarthy), the publisher uncle of Miles's wife Channing (Kim Morgan Greene), offers to keep Cash and Monica's affair out of his newspaper in exchange for Jason dropping his lawsuit against Lucas in \\"The Dead End\\". In the series finale \\"Crossroads\\", Cash is leaving for Washington with Scott and Adrienne. Scott tells a heartbroken Monica that he is glad she is his mother, as a pained Sable watches. Sable suggests that Monica sue the Cassidys but Monica rejects the idea, only wanting Scott to be happy. Sable picks up Scott from school without the Cassidys' consent and persuades him to come with her. Dynasty season nine Monica visits her mother Sable, who has relocated to Denver, in \\"The Son Also Rises\\". Sable convinces Monica to stay and help her with her campaign to destroy her cousin Alexis, Fallon's mother. In \\"Grimes and Punishment\\", Monica tries to persuade Jeff to take Sable's side in the impending war between Alexis and Sable. In \\"Here Comes the Son\\", Blake's son Adam Carrington (Gordon Thomson) retouches a photograph of half-siblings Jeff and Monica to appear as if their relationship may be incestuous. In \\"Blasts from the Past\\", Jeff attacks Adam after discovering he was responsible for the photo, prompting Alexis to reveal in front of Sable and Monica that Jason is not Miles or Monica's father. Sable confides in Blake that twins Miles and Monica were the products of rape. Reboot series A Dynasty reboot series premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017, featuring Wakeema Hollis as Monica. In this series, Monica is the sister of Jeff Colby (Sam Adegoke) and the daughter of Cesil Colby (Hakeem Kae-Kazim) and Dominique Deveraux (Michael Michele), who is the half-sister of Blake Carrington (Grant Show). The Colbys are newly wealthy, and executive producer Sallie Patrick said that setting them up as competition for the Carringtons would help the show to explore race, class, and gender issues. =Casting= Hollis was cast as Monica the same week she landed the recurring role of makeup salesgirl Harriet on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. She said that though both roles are different, they both represent strong female storylines. Hollis worked on the first seasons of both Dynasty and Mrs. Maisel concurrently. =Characterization= Delia Harrington of Den of Geek wrote early in season one that \\"Unfortunately, Monica's only qualities so far fall squarely in the black best friend trope\\". Monica and Fallon's long friendship has its problems, and Monica calls out what she perceives as Fallon's \\"subtle racism\\"; makes it clear that she does not exist merely to make Fallon feel better; and laments that Fallon's overtures of friendship are often self-serving. Fallon using Monica's strained relationship with her imprisoned father as a means to meet with the warden about an energy contract pushes Monica to the edge. She tells Fallon off, and then pursues Fallon's ex-boyfriend Michael. Harrington hoped that Monica's relationship with Michael would \\"pull her more centrally into the story.\\" Andrea Reiher of Brit + Co called Monica \\"far more devious than anybody knew\\" when she pretends to oppose Jeff in \\"Promises You Can't Keep\\" but is really looking for revenge against the Carringtons for her family falling apart in her youth. Harrington notes that, until \\"Nothing But Trouble\\", Monica and the Colbys \\"generally had the moral high ground\\", and Monica seemed to genuinely care for Fallon and felt bad for manipulating her. Harrington called Monica \\"the most likely to eventually turn on Jeff and help (or at least tip off) Culhane or Fallon.\\" Harrington wrote that Monica remains \\"the most reasonable\\" of the Colbys in \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\" as she reaches her limit with Jeff, taking over guardianship of her father and calling out Jeff on the selfishness of his crusade against the Carringtons. She also tells Jeff not to play the victim, since his own machinations blew up in his face. When Monica sabotages Dominique's visit to Atlanta in \\"The Sight of You\\", Reed Gaudens of Hidden Remote wrote, \\"Finally, Dynasty gives Monica something juicer to do other than bickering with Fallon or playing second fiddle to Jeff. Let's hope that with her delicious display of manipulation, we're going to continue to see a devious but also vulnerable side of Monica.\\" Monica is still holding a grudge against her mother for abandoning their family when Dominique returns in \\"New Lady in Town\\", but Jeff manages to broker a truce. Monica steps up in \\"Wild Ghost Chase\\" and looks into the lack of progress in the investigation of Jeff's disappearance. She comes to the brink of discovering her mother's duplicity, and Dominique drugs her to delay her investigation, but Gaudens notes that \\"Monica's too smart. She brings Jeff back, and they kick Dominique out.\\" In \\"Shoot from the Hip\\", Vanessa disobeys Dominique and tells Monica they are sisters because she sees that Monica is a good person being deceived by their mother. =Storylines=Season one Jeff Colby's sister Monica is introduced in the series premiere \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\" as the best friend since high school of Fallon Carrington (Elizabeth Gillies). In \\"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\\", it is established that the Colbys' father, Cesil, is in jail. Monica refuses Fallon's urging to visit him in \\"Rotten Things\\", and is mad to discover that Fallon is sleeping with her brother Jeff while still harboring feelings for Michael Culhane (Robert Christopher Riley). The women have a falling out as Monica accuses Fallon of being self-absorbed and not a good friend. Monica then begins a romantic relationship with Michael. Monica is horrified when Jeff finally admits his plan to destroy the Carringtons in \\"Promises You Can't Keep\\", but she later agrees to help him. Fallon later discovers that the Colbys are conspiring against her in \\"Nothing But Trouble\\". In \\"Our Turn Now\\", she makes a show of her trust in Monica to encourage a confession, but Monica stays silent. As Jeff and Fallon's feud goes public in \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\", Monica cuts ties with Jeff and takes guardianship of a released Cesil. Fallon's mother Alexis Carrington (Nicollette Sheridan) arranges a reconciliation between Jeff and Monica in \\"A Line from the Past\\". In \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", Jeff and Monica learn from their grandmother‚Äîthe former secretary of Thomas Carrington (Bill Smitrovich)‚Äîthat their mother, Millie, was fathered by Thomas. Alexis informs them that as Thomas' grandchildren, they are entitled to a portion of his shares in Carrington Atlantic. Jeff and Monica reveal their Carrington heritage in \\"Dead Scratch\\", and declare their intention to force a sale of the company. Season two In season two, Monica reluctantly hires Kirby Anders (Maddison Brown) to help her open Club Colby in \\"Ship of Vipers\\". In \\"A Temporary Infestation\\", Fallon and Monica's new business venture threatens Jeff and Michael's secret connection to the devious Ada Stone (Katherine LaNasa). Jeff invites his mother Dominique Deveraux to Atlanta for a reunion in \\"The Sight of You\\". Monica, still furious over their mother's abandonment, calls Dominique and tells her not to come. Jeff is disappointed when she does not arrive, or even call. Dominique reappears in \\"New Lady in Town\\" as Jeff recovers at home. She and Monica clash over Dominique's abandonment, and though Dominique is apologetic, she asserts that Jeff and Monica were better off being raised by their grandmother. Dominique takes a secret phone call, revealing that she has been manipulating Jeff and Monica, and that she has other children in New York. Monica is vaguely supportive in \\"Deception, Jealousy, and Lies\\" when Jeff and Dominique plot to frame Adam for Jeff's \\"murder\\". Season three In season three, Monica comes close to learning that Dominique double-crossed Jeff in \\"Wild Ghost Chase\\", so Dominique drugs her daughter to delay her investigation while Dominique makes a play to gain control of an absent Jeff's money. Jeff returns, and he and Monica cut ties with Dominique for her machinations. In \\"Something Desperate\\", Jeff and Monica are shocked as Dominique claims responsibility for the explosion that injured Adam Carrington (Sam Underwood). Dominique's stepdaughter Vanessa Deveraux (Jade Payton) arrives in Atlanta in \\"Mother? I'm at La Mirage\\", but Dominique wants to keep Vanessa's identity hidden from Jeff and Monica until she can secure their help for Vanessa's singing career. Monica softens to Dominique in \\"Shoot from the Hip\\", agreeing to sign Vanessa to her label and have Dominique and Vanessa over for Thanksgiving. Michael pressures Dominique to tell Jeff and Monica that Vanessa is their step-sister. Dominique convinces Blake to give her incriminating information on Michael, which she uses to silence him. Angry that Dominique is perpetuating the lie and has no intention of confessing, Vanessa reveals to a furious Monica that they are sisters. In \\"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\\", Monica decides to go to New York to open another Club Colby, and invites Vanessa to go with her. =Reception= Gaudens noted early in season three that Hollis was not a series regular \\"but seriously should be\\".

Many Awadhis also migrated to Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Maharashtra ,Odisha in India and some adjoining regions of the Terai in Nepal, and in addition 1.9 per cent of Nepalis are Awadhi speakers. Awadhi people can be found throughout the world, most notably in the Caribbean, Fiji, Guyana, Mauritius, South Africa, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Bollywood actor and superstar Amitabh Bachchan is Awadhi from his father's (Harivansh Rai Bachchan) side. Historically, Indo-Aryans dominated the North Indian Gangetic Planes; thus, the Awadhi language continuously evolved over the centuries in the Awadh region of Uttar Pradesh.  Language  The Awadhi language is spoken by about 38 million people. In India, native speakers are estimated to be 4 million, while in Nepal native speakers are estimated to be 500,000 persons. Linguistically, Awadhi can be considered a distinct language with its own grammar. However, colloquially, Awadhi is considered a variety of Hindi speaking, and is not formally taught in any institution.  Cuisine  Consisting of both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes, Awadhi cuisine has influences that can be linked to the Mughal Empire. It is similar to cuisines from surrounding areas, such as Bhojpur, Kashmir, Central Asia, Punjab, and Hyderabad. Awadhi cuisine is known for its use of aromatics and spices, such as cardamom and saffron , in a slow fire cooking process. There is also notable variety in ingredients that are cooked, such as paneer and mutton. One of the most notable and popular dishes is the kebab, which comes in a variety of forms. In addition, there are rice, curry, dessert, and chaat preparations that are specific to Awadhi cuisine.

Admissions The school is just north of Huntington, close to the A1237 bypass, the Foss Walk, and the River Foss. The school has a sixth form. History The Joseph Rowntree Village Trust maintains the model village of New Earswick, built by the Quaker organisation. It is analogous to Bournville and the Cadbury family, who were also Quakers. The village of Earswick is on the other side of the A1237 and the river, to the north-east. The primary school opened in 1912. The school was built when the area was in the North Riding Local Education Authority. It opened on 12 January 1942 to serve the Flaxton Rural District, comprising nineteen villages. It was officially opened on 7 July 1942 by Rab Butler. It had a capacity for 480, based on class sizes of 40. It was and built in West Huntington Park. From 1944, it was proposed to make the school bi-lateral, with a technical school section of the school intake. In 2016, the school was successfully sued for ¬£180,000 due to disabled discrimination of a former employee. Comprehensive school The early 1970s were a period of change for the school. In 1973 the long planned raising of the school leaving age to 16 came into effect, in the same year North Riding Education Committee adopted the comprehensive system. As a result of the 1974 local government reorganisation of 1974 the school continued as a comprehensive under control of North Yorkshire County Council, with intake mainly from the Ryedale District Council catchment area. With 1973 being the first year with a full fifth form, by 1974 there were sufficient numbers for the creation of a sixth form, although initially only fourteen pupils took advantage. Five academic subjects were available with the first A Levels awarded in 1976. Education in York was reorganised in 1985 and the school became a comprehensive. When the York bypass was built in 1985, a subway was built for walking to Haxby from the school. School reconstruction Construction began on the ¬£29 million reconstruction project in September 2008, and was completed in early 2010. It was built by Carillion, with an energy efficient building with a biomass boiler and 120-seat lecture theatre. The old school was demolished and used as foundation material for a car park. The school has a main hall, playing fields, a sport centre, and an ASD unit. Each department is called a cluster, named after a famous topic or individual corresponding to the department's subject, such as Turing, Faraday and Vaudeville. Academic results Results at GCSE are at the England average. In 2009 72% of students achieved 5 or more passes at GCSE A*‚ÄìC. At A-level in 2009, 99% of students achieved grade A to E, 90% achieved A to C and 60% of students achieved A's or B's.

The neighborhood of a solution is a set of similar solutions obtained by relatively simple modifications to the original solution. For a very large-scale neighborhood search, the neighborhood is large and possibly exponentially sized. The resulting algorithms can outperform algorithms using small neighborhoods because the local improvements are larger. If neighborhood searched is limited to just one or a very small number of changes from the current solution, then it can be difficult to escape from local minima, even with additional meta-heuristic techniques such as Simulated Annealing or Tabu search. In large neighborhood search techniques, the possible changes from one solution to its neighbor may allow tens or hundreds of values to change, and this means that the size of the neighborhood may itself be sufficient to allow the search process to avoid or escape local minima, though additional meta-heuristic techniques can still improve performance.

Smeed seated center-right. The Potomac Creek Bridge (Potomac Creek Viaduct or Potomac Run Bridge) was first built in 1842 by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad across the Potomac Creek in Stafford County, Virginia, United States. During the American Civil War, the bridge offered the only rail access between the Potomac River and the cities of Fredericksburg and Richmond, making it a vital supply line to both the Confederate and Union armies. In the spring of 1862 as Confederate forces retreated to Fredericksburg the bridge was destroyed. In 1862, the United States Military Railroad was formed under the command of General Herman Haupt. One of the first tasks was to restore the 13-mile stretch of railroad from Aquia Creek to Falmouth that was destroyed by the retreating Confederate Army. In May 1862, Herman Haupt supervised common Union infantrymen from the Army of the Rappahannock in harvesting two billion feet of local lumber to construct the Potomac Creek Bridge, accomplishing this task in just nine working days. President Abraham Lincoln, on a visit on May 28, 1862, observed \\"That man Haupt has built a bridge five hundred feet long and one hundred feet high, across Potomac Creek, on which loaded trains are passing every hour, and upon my word, gentlemen, there is nothing in it but cornstalks and beanpoles.\\" The Haupt bridge stood until June 1863. The Union Army built as many as four railroad bridges atop the same abutment over the remaining years of the war. Around 1899, the bridge was replaced and the south abutment and its approaching right-of-way were abandoned.

The British garrison was able to hold out until it was relieved.McLynn p.181-82 The British fired 26,554 cannonballs and more than 200,000 cartridge rounds in defence of the town.McLynn p.165 The failure to take Madras was a huge disappointment for the French and a massive setback to their campaign in India compounded by the later Battle of Wandiwash. The British victory helped contribute to the Annus Mirabilis of 1759. The French begin bombardment of Madras, India French forces begin bombardment of Madras, India on 2 January 1758. Background Great Britain and France had been struggling for colonial supremacy in India for several years. in 1746 the city had been captured by the French, but it was returned to the British in 1748. Following the fresh outbreak of war both sides were soon in conflict again. By 1757 Britain held the upper hands after several victories by Robert Clive. In 1758 French reinforcements under Lally had arrived in Pondicherry and set about advancing France's position on the Coromandel Coast, notably capturing Fort St. David.Harvey p.236 This caused alarm to the British, most of whose troops were with Clive in Bengal.Anderson p.417 Lally was poised to strike against Madras in June 1758, but short of money, he launched an unsuccessful attack on Tanjore hoping to raise revenue there. By the time he was ready to launch his assault on Madras it was December before the first French troops reached Madras, delayed partly by the onset of the monsoon season. This gave the British extra time to prepare their defences, and withdraw their outposts - boosting the garrison to nearly 4,000 troops.McLynn p.174-80 Siege The French commander at Madras, Lally, depicted at the later Siege of Pondicherry by Paul Philipotteaux. =First skirmishes= Madras in 1758 was divided broadly into two distinct parts. The \\"Black town\\" where the majority native population lived which was unfortified - and the \\"White town\\" where the smaller European population lived which was dominated by Fort St George. On 14 December, French troops entered the Black town unopposed, and finding it undefended, began to loot the houses. The British then launched a sortie with 600 men under Colonel William Draper attacking the scattered French. Bloody streetfighting broke out which left 300 dead on each side, before Draper's men withdrew into the fort.McLynn p.180-81 While the result had been indecisive, and casualties even, the fight had a devastating effect on French morale. The two French commanders Lally and Bussy began arguing over the failure to cut off and trap Draper's raiding force. Lally fiercely criticised Bussy in public, but did not dismiss him from his post as second-in-command.McLynn p.181 =Bombardment commences= As the French took up their positions around the city, ready to besiege Fort St George, they were unable to open fire as they were still waiting for artillery ammunition to be brought up for the major siege guns. For three weeks the guns stood silent, until on 2 January 1759 they began firing on the citadel. In spite of an intense five-day bombardment, and several infantry assaults the French failed to make the breakthrough they were hoping to - as the British defences remained largely intact. A large mine was detonated under the fortress, but this made little impact on the defences.McLynn p.181-182 French morale fell further as they realised how little effect their attacks had had on the defenders. Many of the soldiers grew disgruntled and deserted, including 150 who switched sides to join the garrison. Lally was also facing an attack on his lines of supply by Muhammed Yusuf Khan the British Sepoy commander at Chingleput, the only force that had not withdrawn into Madras upon the approach of the French. Lally managed to beat off the British attack, but they still remained in the vicinity menacing his rear, stealing much needed supplies and blocking the passage of many to his forces.McLynn p.182 =Major assault= William Draper who commanded the British defenders during the siege. After several weeks of heavy bombardment, the French were at last starting to make headway against the town's defences. The main bastion had been destroyed, and a breach opened in the walls. The heavy exchange of fire had flattened much of Madras, with most of the town's houses gutted by shells.McLynn p.182-83 On 30 January a Royal Navy frigate ran the French blockade and carried a large sum of money and a company of reinforcements into Madras. Significantly they brought the news that the British fleet under Admiral George Pocock was on its way from Calcutta. When Lally discovered this news he became aware that he would have to launch an all-or-nothing assault to storm the fortress before Pocock arrived. He convened a council of war, where it was agreed to launch an intense bombardment on the British guns, to knock them out of action. =French withdrawal= On 16 February six British vessels, carrying 600 troops, arrived off Madras. Faced with this added threat Lally took the immediate decision to break off the siege and withdraw south.Harvey p.239 Aftermath The British victory at Madras was considered part of the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 as part of a string of British successes around the globe, and helped lay the foundations for eventual British strategic supremacy in India. British forces went on the offensive in India, decisively defeating a French force at Wandiwash and then capturing Pondicherry in 1761. The string of battles were a major turning point in the battle for dominance on the subcontinent between Britain and France.

He served as an army medical officer in World War I, winning the Croix de Guerre. After the war he engaged in research in marine biology, and then practiced as a doctor in France; in his spare time, he climbed in the Alps and Pyrenees. In 1938 he set off to India by bicycle to pursue his interest in Oriental religions. During World War II he worked as a doctor in occupied Paris. After the war he went to Indochina, whence in 1947 he made a journey alone through Eastern Tibet and China in order to research aspects of Tibetan Buddhism. During this journey he tried but failed to reach Lhasa disguised as a mendicant lama. As he could speak and write Tibetan, he was able to converse with the lamas, and was initiated into the rituals of one of the Buddhist sects. This journey is described in his best-known book Caravane vers Bouddha, translated into English by Peter Fleming as Tibetan Marches. From Beijing, where that book ends in 1948, he made an equally adventurous journey back through Tibet to Indochina. Later he spent two years in the Kerguelen Islands as a doctor to a French expedition. In 1954 he joined an Australian expedition in the same region. He wrote many other books on his travels, and on Oriental religion and philosophy. References *Migot, Andr√© (translated by Peter Fleming) (1955).

TSTC's methods include political and media advocacy including a self-published blog (\\"Mobilizing the Region\\"), original research and analysis, litigation, and community organizing. History TSTC was launched in the early 1990s by a dozen New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut environmental and planning organizations that were alarmed by the mobility, economic, quality of life and environmental implications of worsening auto and truck dependence in the metropolitan area, and believed that the 1991 ISTEA federal transportation legislation created new opportunities to advocate for sustainable state transportation policy. Some of these founding organizations include Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Environmental Defense Fund, New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, Regional Plan Association, Scenic Hudson, and the NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign. The Campaign acquired its own staff in 1993 and incorporated as an independent non-profit corporation in 1994. Tri-State has offices in New York City, Albany, NY and Camden, NJ. Campaign priorities The Tri-State Transportation Campaign and its allies claim to have achieved their goals of changing transportation planning and policies‚Äîparticularly in reducing funding for road widening‚Äîover the past 13 years. In New Jersey, the organization was a key proponent of the New Jersey Department of Transportation's policy of connecting land use planning with transportation projects and has opposed many road improvements. In New York, TSTC has consistently promoted additional funding for transit services, especially suburban bus systems, obtaining grants from the New York State Department of Transportation for the same purpose. =Reducing funding for road expansion= TSTC has persuaded elected and appointed officials to cancel or scale down plans for Route 92 in Middlesex County, NJ, the Cross- Westchester Expressway in Westchester County, NY, the Long Island Expressway in Queens, the Goethals Bridge, the Staten Island Expressway, and Route 206 in Byram, NJ. TSTC has argued that the planned expansion of the Garden State Parkway between exits 30 and 80 will not provide long-term congestion relief and sued the NJ Department of Environmental Protection in 2009 over its approval of environmental permits for the project.Tri-State Transportation Campaign (2-04-2009). \\"Watchdog organization sues to halt Garden State Parkway widening\\" TSTC opposed NYSDOT's Route 347 widening project on Long Island. This project is now being recast as a suburban boulevard with a greenway as originally proposed by the Committee for a New 347. =Increasing funding for mass transit= TSTC seeks to convince policymakers to maintain and increase subsidies for mass transit operations and construction projects. It opposed a planned 2010 fare increase for NJ TransitAssociated Press (3-05-2010). \\"New Jersey Transit Plans Higher Fares\\". and plans to cut service on New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority-run transit systems.Haberman, Clyde (3-05-2010). \\"A transit plan brings hoots and hate\\" New York Times. =Revitalizing cities= TSTC works with community groups in Newark, advocating for streets that are more walkable and more attractive for development. In Trenton, TSTC supports the city's plan to convert a portion of Route 29 into a waterfront boulevard. Working with groups in the South Bronx, TSTC succeeded in inserting plans for removing the Sheridan Expressway into New York State Department of Transportation studies for the area.Barrera, Javier. \\"The future of the Sheridan Expressway\\" Hunts Point Express. In Connecticut, TSTC is working to build support for a removal of Route 34 in New Haven and its replacement with a boulevard and mixed-use development.See, for example: Appel, Allan (4-17-2008). \\"'I Say, \\"Tear it Down.\\" New Haven Independent. =Reforming state transportation agencies= Consistent analysis of spending and project priorities in New Jersey resulted in a significant diminution of spending for new highway capacity in the state. In the mid- nineties, the NJDOT was spending over 50 percent of its capital dollars on new or wider highways. In 2008, that number had decreased to 1.5 percent. The New Jersey DOT is adopting transportation-efficient land use planning, which seeks to reduce the heavy car trip generation that characterizes sprawl development. The Connecticut Department of Transportation and New York Department of Transportation are now also considering ways to incorporate land use into project design and planning. In 2008, NYSDOT announced a GreenLITES program to incorporate sustainability into transportation projects, and made the redesign of Route 347 on Long Island a model project for the program. =Introducing roadway pricing to manage traffic= The TSTC helped advance New York City's 2007 congestion pricing plan, which was approved by the New York City Council but failed to pass through the New York State Legislature. In 2000, TSTC worked to persuade the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to implement time-variable tolls that charge drivers more to travel during congested periods. Both agencies report reductions in growth of peak-hour traffic. In 2008, the peak/off-peak differential was increased. In Connecticut, a state without tolls, TSTC is pushing for congestion pricing as a way to manage traffic and pay for transportation projects.Walkley, Alison (2-28-2009). \\"'Congestion pricing' under review by legislators\\" Westport News. TSTC also advocated for cashless, all-electronic tolling on the NJ Turnpike and Garden State Parkway and helped to secure studies on cashless tolling at the Port Authority and MTA. =Mitigating truck impacts= TSTC broadcasts projected truck traffic increases throughout New Jersey and New York City and works with environmental justice groups and neighborhoods to win better management of truck traffic. =Bus rapid transit & suburban bus systems= TSTC advocated for CTfastrak, which is the first true bus rapid transit system in the region. In Long Island, Tri-State worked with civic groups to provide support for bus riders calling for adequate funding and reliable service. And for over 10 years, TSTC has been advocating for improved bus service over the rebuilding of the Tappan Zee Bridge, and was a member of the Transit Task Force that developed specific recommendations for implementation on the new bridge. =Complete streets= TSTC advocates for Complete Streets, not only for communities to adopt policies or ordinances, but to fund their implementation as well. In 2014, TSTC worked with the City of Stamford, Connecticut to draft a Complete Streets ordinance, and partnered with BikeWalkCT on Connecticut‚Äôs first ever Complete Streets Forum. In 2012, TSTC was a lead advocate for the successful passage of New York‚Äôs Complete Streets law. TSTC advocated for local Complete Streets policies throughout New Jersey: Cranford, Newark, Trenton, Fanwood, Linden, Mantua Township, Camden, and Woodbury. TSTC's advocacy contributed to half of the Smart Growth America's top eight NJ Complete Streets policies in 2013 [Trenton, Linden, Camden, and Cranford]. In New York, TSTC successfully campaigned for a Complete Streets implementation fund for Suffolk County, which was created in June 2014, a year and half after the County adopted a Complete Streets policy. Also, in conjunction with regional partners, TSTC developed a ‚ÄúComplete Streets in a Box‚Äù toolkit to help local legislators and advocates advance safer streets policies in their own communities. In 2013, TSTC developed two webinars (1,2) demonstrating how to successfully implement Complete Streets after policy adoption.

Biography Born Franz Friedemann, Ferenczy studied singing at the Milan Conservatory under renowned teacher Francesco Lamperti from 1853-1854. He continued to study further in Vienna from 1855-1858 before making his professional opera debut in 1859 under the name Franz Ferenczy as Manrico in Verdi's Il trovatore at the opera house in Graz. He appeared in several smaller regional houses for the next three years and then joined the Berlin State Opera in 1862. While in Berlin he became acquainted with lauded opera composer Giacomo Meyerbeer who became a fan of his singing.Biography of Franz Ferenczy on Operissimo.com (in German). Accessed 25 February 2009. In 1863, Ferenczy made an extensive tour throughout Germany, Russia, and England appearing at most of those countries major opera houses, including the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London, the Hamburg State Opera in Germany, and the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow among many others. He joined the Vienna State Opera in 1864 where he sang leading tenor roles through 1868. Between 1868 and 1871 he appeared in numerous operas throughout Europe, including performances in Milan, Barcelona, London, Hamburg, Berlin, and Karlsruhe. In 1871, Ferenczy joined the roster at the Grossherzogliches Theater (now the Staatskapelle Weimar) making his debut as Lyonel in Flotow's Martha. He continued to sing roles with that opera company up through the winter of 1880, only a few months before his death in 1881. He most notably portrayed the role of Samson in the world premiere of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns's Samson et Dalila on 2 December 1877 under the direction of Eduard Lassen. He also toured frequently with the company for opera performances in Sweden and Norway. Repertoire Ferenczy spent much of his career singing French grand opera and German Romantic opera, particularly in operas by Meyerbeer and Richard Wagner, although his repertoire also encompassed a handful of bel canto roles and Verdi roles. Among the many Meyerbeer roles he portrayed are both Jean de Leyde and Jonas in Le proph√®te, Raoul de Nangis in Les Huguenots, and Vasco da Gama in L'Africaine among others. His Wagner roles included Loge in Das Rheingold, the title role in Lohengrin, Siegmund in Die Walk√ºre, and the title role in Tannh√§user. Ferenczy was also admired for his performances of Adolar in Carl Maria von Weber's Euryanthe, Arnoldo in Rossini's William Tell, Eleazar in Fromental Hal√©vy's La Juive, and Manrico in Verdi's Il Trovatore.

French forces occupied Madras until the end of hostilities when it was exchanged for the British conquest of Louisbourg in North America as part of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. One of the British defenders, Robert Clive made his name by escaping from the French captors and carrying news of the city's fall to his superiors at Fort St David. Background Since the 1720s the colonial rivalry between Britain and France in India had been growing in intensity. Following the French decision to join the War of the Austrian Succession on the opposing side to Britain, the British despatched a Royal Navy squadron under Commodore Curtis Barnett to raid and harass French settlements in India.Harvey p.30-31 During 1745 this force attacked a number of French ships, disrupting commerce, and ruining several leading French merchants. In response the French despatched a similarly-sized fleet under the Bertrand-Fran√ßois Mah√© de La Bourdonnais. After fighting an inconclusive battle the two fleets withdrew to repair, with the British retreating to Ceylon and the French using their base at Pondicherry. Wary of fighting another major naval battle ‚Äì the British commander, Edward Peyton, chose to stay away from the Coramandel coast and withdrew to the safety of Bengal, leaving the British settlements on the Coramandel badly exposed to the French.Harvey p.31 The French Governor of Pondicherry Dupleix authorised an attack on Madras. To gain local Indian approval for this he promised the Nawab of the Carnatic that he would hand over Madras to him once he had captured it from the British. Battle On 7 September 1746 the inhabitants of Madras woke to find a French fleet sitting offshore ‚Äì and an expedition of soldiers being landed on the shore. The French ships opened fire on the town ‚Äì but with little effect, struggling to find the correct range and by nightfall a large portion of the garrison had been lulled into a false sense of security.Harvey pp. 31‚Äì32 The following morning the French resumed their bombardment from both land and shore, this time with much more accuracy. The fortifications of Madras had been poorly constructed and were largely unable to resist such an attack. As the number of British casualties grew, the morale of the discipline of the troops collapsed. After a direct strike on the liquor stores, a number of soldiers abandoned their posts and drank themselves into a stupor. Civilians from the town took their places manning the defences ‚Äì but it was clear resistance was collapsing.Harvey pp. 32‚Äì33 Surrender The siege of Madras in 1746 for Joseph Francois Dupleix troops and ships of La Bourdonnais. The city surrendered in September 1746. Madras was returned to England in 1748 to restore peace. On 9 September the Governor of Madras, Nicholas Morse sued for peace. The terms offered to him by La Bourdonnais were surprisingly generous ‚Äì the French were to take over the fort and warehouses, but the rest of the town would remain under British control. The British troops who had surrendered would be petitioned. This caused a dispute with his superior Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix who favoured total French annexation of Madras. La Bourdonnais insisted on honouring the peace terms ‚Äì and for a month the peace agreement he had signed held.Harvey pp. 33‚Äì34 However, when a violent storm blew up in October, La Bourdonnais and his fleet were forced to withdraw and sail for the safety of Pondicherry ‚Äì a third of his ships were lost in the storm and Dupleix was now in full command of Madras. Dupleix revoked the previously lenient terms and locked up a number of the garrison and civilians. He then set about looting and preparing to destroy Fort St George.Harvey pp. 34‚Äì35 A handful of these prisoners led by Robert Clive, a young clerk, dressed up as natives and managed to slip out of their prison. Once outside they were challenged by real Indians, who spoke to them in languages they didn't understand. Clive and his companions hurried on before they could be exposed. After a three-day journey, made mostly by night, they reached Fort St David hundred miles away carrying news of the disastrous French attack on Madras.Harvey pp. 35‚Äì36 The story of Clive's escape was the first to bring him wider attention. Aftermath The French occupied the town for the duration of the war. Despite Dupleix's promise earlier to hand the territory over to the Nawab of the Carnatic, Dupleix refused to do so.Naravane pp. 152‚Äì153 A force of 10,000 sent by the Nawab to enforce the agreement was routed by a small French force led by Captain Louis Paradis at the battle of Adyar on 24 October 1746. The French subsequently tried to take Fort St David but found the resistance much tougher, and were ultimately forced to withdraw. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle that ended the war made provision for Madras to be returned to the British in exchange for Louisbourg in Acadia which had been captured by British forces in 1745.Keay p. 285 The French besieged Madras again in 1759, this time without success.

The FATECs are important Brazilian institutions of higher education, being pioneers in the graduation of technologists. They are located in several cities of the S√£o Paulo state, with four campuses in the capital (Bom Retiro, Campos El√≠seos, East Zone and South Zone), and several other units in the metropolitan region of S√£o Paulo, countryside and seashore. The 46 FATECs offer high degree careers in virtually all areas of knowledge. In most of the units, are offered courses of higher education in technology, focused in the training of technologists. The units of S√£o Caetano do Sul, Ourinhos, Carapicu√≠ba and Americana, however, offer the option of bachelorship and licentiate degree in the career of System Analysis and Information Technology, starting the tradition of FATECs to train, too, bachelors and licentiates. More than 28 thousand students are currently enrolled in FATECs. For the formation of this quota is annually invested more than R$1 billion (US$420,000 mi). History The first milestone of the trajectory of FATECs was the founding, in 1969, of the Center of Technological Education of S√£o Paulo State, by the current Governor of the State Abreu Sodr√©, which had as objective the training of technologists to supply the growing demand for university-level professionals. The CEETEPS was installed in Coronel Fernando Prestes plaza, in the center of S√£o Paulo, using the old campus of USP Polytechnic School. The courses run by FATEC Bom Retiro (or FATEC-SP) are the oldest, having been taught since 1969. That year, was founded in the city of Sorocaba the Sorocaba Technological College, with the same goals. In 1970, were created the higher education technological courses of Construction, in the forms: Buildings, Hydraulic Works, Earthmoving and Paving. Were subsequently created the higher education technological courses of Mechanics, in the forms: Workshops and Designer. In 1973, by state law, the Center came to be called Centro Estadual de Educa√ß√£o Tecnol√≥gica Paula Souza (State Center of Technological Education) and their classes began to form the S√£o Paulo State Technological College. This way, CEETEPS became the maintainer of two FATECs: one in S√£o Paulo and one in Sorocaba. In 1974, has been created the higher education technological career of Data Processing, today still reference in the area of Information Technology. In 1976, the state government merge, by law, all its isolated higher education establishments into the UNESP (S√£o Paulo State University). As CEETEPS was not an educational institution, but the maintainer of two academic units, the law that created the UNESP established that CEETEPS will integrate the new university in the condition of special institution, linked and associated with it. Admission As in other Brazilian government academic institutions, the teaching in FATEC is funded by taxation and not paid for directly by the students. The admission is done through public concourse (vestibular), open to anyone who has completed or is about to finish high school. CEETEPS himself is responsible for the public concourse, which is conducted every six months. The vestibular of FATEC, unlike the majority of Brazilian public institutions of higher education, consists in only one phase, covering various questions of multiple choice and one essay. According to 2008 vestibular, 38,220 applicants competed for 6,175 places in dispute that year. The major concurrence recorded was of career of Systems Analysis and Development (Night) in FATEC S√£o Paulo (Bom Retiro), with 22.8 applicants per vacancy. In 2009, the average demand in the three campuses of the capital was 7.54 candidates per seat. The data confirm the tradition of FATEC to promote one of the most competitive selective processes of Brazil. Structure and Teachers The S√£o Paulo State Technoloulties are divided into 46 units, with presence in 44 cities of S√£o Paulo State. In opposition with other Brazilian institutions of state and federal education, FATECs do not have rectory, with each unit being coordinated by a director, subordinated to CEETEPS superintendent and bound to UNESP rectory. Is mandatory requirement for admission as a teacher in FATEC be carrying the title of master or doctor in recommended program recognized by Brazilian law. The wages of teachers of FATEC are among the best in Brazil public school system, with income of R$4,932.00 (US$2,103.20) for Assistant Professor, R$5,523.84 (US$2,355.58) for Associate Professor and R$6,954.12 (US$2,965.51) for Complete Professor. The maximum salary of teachers is of R$7,743.24 (US$3,302.02). Graduation The FATECs are currently offering 59 undergraduate courses, in all three areas of knowledge. The average length of courses in FATEC is 2,800 hours, with three years duration. Taking into account that the final resolution of the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) provides the minimum hours to 2,400 hours for various careers of bachelorship, we can conclude that even with a shorter duration in comparison to traditional degree courses, the degrees offered in FATECs form professionals with working hours equal and even superior to several BA. This is possible because the number of hours that students remain in schools every day is high, being more than 5 hours on some campuses. It is noteworthy that for the FATECs, Saturday is considered normal day for study. As there is occurring a strong expansion in existing units and in the creation of new faculties of technology, some careers are having their cases being analyzed by the State Council of Education. In these cases, the start of classes is conditional to final approval from the council. Points of Excellence The FATECs are recognized by their remarkable quality on professional training in the areas of Information Technology, Logistics and Transport and Precision Mechanics (Mechatronics). The rate of employability of former students of FATEC is high, compared with Brazilian standards, with more than 93% in labor market, with average starting pay of R$2,500.00 (US$1,066.10). Currently, many FATEC students compete in degree of equality with the students of the best universities in the country, such as the Polytechnic School (Poli-USP) and the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA). The Student's Guide, an annual publication of Editora Abril (popular Brazilian publisher), which evaluates the courses of BA on the market, in its 2008 edition, quoted the career of Bachelorship in System Analysis and Information Technology (FATEC Ourinhos), classifying it with 3 stars (good). The evaluation, taken as very satisfactory for a recent class, is proof of the level of quality associated with S√£o Paulo State Technological Faculties.

The history of BroadstoneThe castle= Broadstone Farm, previously known as Hillhead. The ruins of Braidstone or Broadstone Castle (NS 362 531) remained until about 1850.Porterfield, Page 31. but when Broadstonehall Farm buildings were being rebuilt, the castle was pulled down and its stones used in the building works; the Broadstone Crags, the site of the castle, remain however despite local quarrying. An avenue of trees and the vestiges of a garden had survived until the time of the building of the farm.Paterson, Page 80. Its site was pointed out by Mr W Kerr of Broadstonehall in 1855. The Barony mill Most baronies had a water mill which was under the control of the laird or lord and to which the tenants were thirled or obliged to go to have their grain ground into flour. A proportion of the grain was taken as payment. Thirlage ended in the late 18th century and resulted in a number of mills being abandoned once market forces took a hold. The name 'Crooked Dam' relates to a small dwelling that once existed near the Powgree Burn and the remains of a mill pond site shows that this building was originally the miller's dwelling and the old barony mill once lay below the site of the crooked dam. The barony and associated familiesThe Montgomerys= The Lordship of Giffen, included the Baronies of Giffen, Trearne, Hessilhead, Broadstone, Roughwood and Ramshead.Robertson, Page 285. The old lane leading to the castle's site. The Barony of Braidstone (sic) was possessed by John de Lyddale (Liddel), Dominus de Bradestane in 1452.Coventry, Page 246 Robert Montgomerie of Braidstone was second son of the 3rd Lord Montgomerie. Sir Hugh Montgomerie (1560‚Äì1636) was born here in 1560, son of Adam, 5th Laird of Braidstane. He married the daughter of John Montgomery of Hessilhead, and before 1568 he purchased lands from Hugh, third Earl of Eglinton. He left a daughter, Janet, who married Troilus, the second son of Adam Montgomery of Giffen. Andrew Nevin, inherited the Monkredding estate in 1581 and married Janet, daughter of Adam Montgomery, IV laird of Broadstone Castle. Matthew Montgomerie was a resident at Broadstone, but was recorded as living at Bogstone in 1622.Paterson, Page 81 Hugh, first Viscount of the Great-Ardes, granted a mortgage on the lands of Broadstone to his brother-in-law, Sir John Shaw of Greenock in 1650.Campbell, Page 147 The Ulster connection In 1603 Hugh Montgomery had accompanied King James I and VI on the journey to London to take possession of the English throneJamieson, Page 9 and his surviving brother George was the Dean of Norwich, becoming one of the court chaplains to King James; (George later became Bishop of Derry). These close contacts enabled him to eventually obtain a one third portion of the lands of Con O'Neill, Lord of the Claneboys, in Ulster. He entertained Con O'Neill at Broadstone and helped him to obtain a pardon for an accusation of 'waging war' against Queen Elizabeth I. Mr James Hamilton, son of the minister of Dunlop, later James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye, also obtained a one third portion of these O'Neill lands. Hugh Montgomery brought a colony of Irish Protestants over from his Irish estates in 1600 and later a colony of Protestants from the area were taken over to the Ardes and Clandebora areas of Ireland following the putting down of an Irish revolt.Robertson, Page 281. Hugh was knighted in by King James in 1605, giving him precedency over his rival James Hamilton,The New Statistical Account] and he was created Viscount Montgomery of the Great Ardes on 3 May 1622; he died on 25 May 1636, aged 76. The Earl of Mount Alexander was his grandson, his title deriving from his descent from the family of Alexander, Earls of Stirling. Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery (1560‚Äì1636), is known as one of the \\"founding fathers\\" of the Ulster-Scots along with James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye. Paterson,Paterson, Page 48. the historian, records that the 'Laird of Braidstane's Scotch Colony', established in around 1606, was responsible for the introduction of linen weaving and manufacture to the area around Lurgan in Ireland; he also built mills, the harbour of Donaghadee, and repaired Port Montgomery (now Port Patrick).Jamieson, Page 10 Some of the family of Hugh Hammil of the nearby lands of Roughwood accompanied Hugh Montgomerie to Ireland and became established there as merchants in the Dublin area.Robertson, Page 373. =The Shaws= The Brisbane Aisle in the grounds of Largs Old Kirk bears an armorial device with mullets for the Shaw and annulets for the Montgomeries of Broadstone. As stated, Hugh Montgomery granted a mortgage on the lands of Broadstone to his brother-in-law, Sir John Shaw in 1650. Sir John stayed at the castle occasionally until just after the year 1700. The Shaws gradually alienated the estate in feus until only the farm upon which the castle stood, remained. The family, from Greenock, were resident in 1650 when they purchased the estate. The castle was last occupied in the early 18th century. The lands of Neubottle, now called Windyhouse, comprised Over and Nether Windyhouse and were feued by Sir John Shaw in 1674 to Thomas Shedden. The lands stayed with the Sheddens until James Shedden, who had two sons, one of whom, John joined the army and died in 1821, whilst the other, Thomas, emigrated to Canada.Dobie, Page 345 The Barrs Robertson records a Mary Barr of Broadstone, daughter of J. Barr, who married Robert Buntine-Barr of Trearne and had a son Robert who died at sea.Robertson, Page 155 =The Stewarts= In 1827 and 1829 Broadstone Hall was the residence of Sir M. S. Stewart.AitkenReilly, Page 35 In 1842 Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, Baronet, retained the farm, together with the superiority of the whole.Reilly, Page 55 =The Browns= Thought to be Hugh Brown of Broadstone. Hanging in Beith Library. Memorial to Hugh Brown and Margaret Caldwell of Broadstone. In 1798 Hugh Brown, a merchant in Beith, had purchased Hill of Beith Castle.Dobie, Page 134 He had purchased part of the Broadstone lands prior to this, as well as part of the lands of Geilsland, a portion of the lands of Crummock and part of the lands of Lyonshields in the barony of Hessilhead. He built his mansion house at Brae-head House, later known as Crummock Park. His son Hugh inherited in 1809 and another Hugh Brown of Broadstone inherited in 1857. A memorial at Beith Auld Kirk commemorates the second Hugh Brown of Broadstone (06-04-1787 to 02-01-1857) and his wife Margaret Caldwell (17-08-1783 to 04-06-1845); Hugh Brown Esq is listed as a Justice of the Peace and a member of the Beith gentry in the 1837 Beith Directory. Marshalland, Craig and Geilsland houses lie across the nearby Powgree Burn, together with the Spier's Old School Grounds, now a public parkland. Bogston House and estate This was a residence of the Montgomerie family and it lay between South Barr, Hayhills and Bogfaulds Farms in what is now DM Beith. Bogston was once a well wooded estate of , with fine plantings, orchards and gardens. Part of the Giffen Barony, this property was feued out by the Earl of Eglinton to Robert Montgomerie in 1663. In its latter days Bogston was a farm, but following the creation of the munitions storage facility Bogston was demolished and is now only indicated by a small group of trees. Windyhouse Farm The Baney Hole near Windyhouse Farm. Windyhouse Farm still stands at the junction of the road to Gateside and at one time another road ran past it, serving a number of farms and cottages such as Ward, Scoup, Bogfauld, Birsieknowe and Whitespot, that lay within what is now the MOD Beith base. Windyhouse had a retting pit for the preparation of flax. This required about four to six days of immersion and the waste retting water, which requires treatment to reduce harmful toxic elements before its release, is rich in chemicals and was used as a liquid fertilizer.Gilbert Close to Windyhouse was a deep pool, possibly a collapsed bell pit or limestone quarry, later used to dispose of dead animals, tree stumps, excess soil, etc; it is known as the 'Baney Hole' and is still visible as a wet area in the field. A number of small buildings existed nearby and the foundations of one are in the garden of Windyhouse, whilst another is located in the enclosure formed by hedge boundaries nearby. South Windyhouse Farm, once located next to the Hillhead Railway, no longer exists and no remains are visible. The old names for the lands of Windyhouse was 'Neubotle' a name of English origin. Windyhouse No.10 was an ironstone and clayband mine that was abandoned prior to October 1875.Mines Department, Page 10 Quarrying, lime kilns and railways William Aiton's 1811 map showing Broadstone. The tunnel / overbridge on the old Hillhead Railway. Because of the underlying geology of this part of Ayrshire the presence of the many limestone quarries is to be expected. Lime kilns to produce lime for improving the soil, were a common feature of the countryside before the process became fully industrialised. Nettlehirst near Barrmill was one of the last large traditionally operated lime kilns to operate, surviving until the 1970s, however Broadstone has the substantial remains of one of the largest of the early stone built kilns. This must have created considerable pollution in the area, offset only by the employment it created. It sits right next to the limestone quarry which supplied it. The road running past is still known as 'Reek Road'. The OS maps for 1858 show that the 'Hillhead Railway' ran to the quarry from Barkip Junction on the Ayrshire and Lanarkshire Railway branchline to Kilbirnie. At first sidings and a transfer system existed with a weighing machine at what was to become Brackenhills railway station, later a direct junction or transfer sidings were laid. The line did not survive into the 20th century and may have been narrow-gauge as indicated by the surviving tunnel / overbridge. The old Ordnance Survey maps show that a marble quarry was located nearby, now filled in. The limestone was of such quality that it was worked as marble and was in much demand for chimney pieces. =Jean Deer= The old Crooked Dam millpond site on the Powgree Burn in the Fairy Glen. In Service's semi-fictional novel Jean Deer's husband worked at Broadstone Quarry in the late 19th century and died there following an accident of an unrecorded nature. She was forced to leave her Broadstone home, with her two young children and her baby, as it was required for another working man and his family. Jean took refuge in a ruinous cottage on the moors near Auchenmade. The winter of 1895 was exceptionally severe and come spring David Muir and Tom Service found dead with two of her children. Jean's baby was found alive in the bread oven, for this determined mother was found naked, having fed all her clothes to the fire to keep her baby warm until the last possible moment. She had previously burned all the furniture and the family had so little food that they had even drunk the oil from the lamp.Service, Pages 156 - 157. The old quarry is locally known as Hennis Planting after a worker who died at the site. ;The Hennis Planting and Broadstone's industrial archaeology Image:Broadstone lime kiln.JPGTwo very large limekilns in the Hennis Planting near Broadstone Hall farm.

(1988). Walter Franklin Prince: A Portrait. In Lives and Letters in American Parapsychology: A Biographical History, 1850-1987. McFarland. pp. 75-108. Career Born in Detroit, Maine, Prince graduated from Maine Wesleyan Seminary in 1881 to become an Episcopal minister. He earned a BD in 1886 from Drew Theological Seminary and a PhD from Yale University in 1899. His doctoral thesis was on multiple personality. In 1910 he was the rector of All Saint's Church in Pittsburgh and in 1916 the director of psychotherapeutics at St. Marks's Episcopal Church in New York City. In 1885, Prince married Lelia Madora Colman, they had no children but adopted a daughter. Lelia died in 1924. Prince authored several works on the study of human psychic abilities, among them The Psychic in the House (Boston 1926), The Case of Patience Worth (Boston 1927), The Enchanted Boundary (Boston 1930). He was fiercely critical of the claims of the physical medium Margery Mina Crandon. In 1908, Prince joined the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR). In 1915 he left the clergy and became an assistant for his friend James H. Hyslop. When Hyslop died in 1920, he became the research officer and editor for the ASPR Journal and Proceedings.Litvag, Irving. (1972). Singer in the Shadows: The Strange Story of Patience Worth. Macmillan. p. 246 Prince was a friend to Harry Houdini and Hereward Carrington and they all had exposed the tricks of fraudulent mediums, however, unlike Houdini, both Carrington and Prince believed that some mediums were genuine.Polidoro, Massimo. (2003). Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims. Prometheus Books. Houdini and Prince wrote many letters to each other.Silverman, Kenneth. (1996). Houdini!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss. HarperCollins Publishers. p. 436 According to the psychical researcher Robert Ashby \\"[Prince] remained highly skeptical of PK and other physical phenomena, but felt that there was no doubt at all of telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition.\\"Ashby, Robert. (1987). The Ashby Guidebook for Study of the Paranormal. Red Wheel Weiser. p. 179. In 1927, Prince contributed to the book The Case For And Against Psychical Belief (1927) which contains essays by both believers and skeptics of psychical phenomena. Prince was a close friend with the parapsychologist Joseph Banks Rhine. He published and wrote the introduction for Rhine's book Extrasensory Perception (1934). Prince was a member of the Scientific American Committee to examine paranormal claims. He became one of its editors for articles on parapsychological phenomena. He was the only American, other than William James, who occupied the position of President of the Society for Psychical Research in London, which he did for two years 1930 and 1931. Investigations From left to right. Walter Franklin Prince, Daniel Frost Comstock, Mina Crandon, O. D. Munn, Harry Houdini. Prince was skeptical of the claims of physical mediums. To help expose fraud, he familiarised himself with the tricks of conjurors and became a member of the Society of American Magicians. He discovered that many physical mediums had utilized sleight of hand trickery. He authored the paper A Survey of American Slate-Writing Mediumship which was almost 300 pages. In this paper he exposed the fraudulent methods of the slate-writing medium Pierre L. O. A. Keeler. He later became a believer in psychic phenomena but remained skeptical of spiritualism. In 1921, Prince travelled to Mexico and collaborated with the German physician Gustav Pagenstecher on experiments with the clairvoyant Senora Maria Reyes de Zierold in psychometry. Prince came to the conclusion that she possessed genuine ESP ability. He told Hans Driesch that the experiments with Zierold had converted him, that he had gone to Mexico a skeptic but came back a \\"psychist\\". In 1922, Prince investigated an alleged poltergeist occurrence at a farm in Caledonia Mills. He concluded that the phenomena was produced by Mary-Ellen the adopted daughter of the owners of the farm.Colombo, John Robert. (2000). Ghost Stories of Canada. Dundurn. p. 43. Prince supported the mediumship of Pearl Curran who he had visited in 1924 and experimented with in 1926, but did not come to any definite conclusion. By 1925 due to the investigation of Mina Crandon the American Society for Psychical Research had been taken over by a spiritualist faction. The ASPR championed Crandon and suppressed any reports unfavourable to her.Ch√©roux, Cl√©ment. (2005). The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult. Yale University Press. p. 219. Prince was alarmed at the number of \\"credulous spiritualists\\" that joined the ASPR.Moore, Robert Laurence. (1977). In Search of White Crows: Spiritualism, Parapsychology, and American Culture. Oxford University Press. p. 176. In response, Prince who was the Society's research officer resigned to establish the Boston Society for Psychical Research with the help of his friend William McDougall. Prince and other critics were accused by supporters of Crandon of being biased against paranormal phenomena. Prince in a letter to magician Joseph Rinn on February 1, 1934 described the Crandon case as \\"the most ingenious, persistent, and fantastic complex of fraud in the history of psychic research.\\"Rinn, Joseph. (1950). Sixty Years of Psychical Research: Houdini and I Among the Spiritualists. Truth Seeker Company. p. 576Hansel, C. E. M. (1989). The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited. Prometheus Books. p. 245. Prince exposed the medium Maria Silbert. She had developed the ability to maneuver a stiletto using only her feet and was thus able to write names on cigarette cases when they were held under the table.Polidoro, Massimo. (2001). Final Seance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. p. 103. Prince attended a series of s√©ance sittings with Rudi Schneider and no paranormal phenomena was observed. In his notes in the Bulletin VII of the Boston SPR published under Experiments with Physical Mediums in Europe (1928) he wrote \\"despite my studied and unremitting complaisance, no phenomena have occurred when I had any part in the control, save curtain movement which were capable of the simplest explanation.\\"Spence, Lewis. (2003). Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 805. He also attended s√©ances with the medium Jan Guzyk and came to the conclusion he had no paranormal ability. Reception Prince's research and writings were influential amongst parapsychologists. He has been described as one of the \\"great masters\\" in the history of parapsychology. Prince drew criticism from both skeptics and spiritualists. Those in the spiritualist community considered him an opponent of spiritualism, whilst skeptics such as psychologist Joseph Jastrow accused Prince of being na√Øve and not applying the same level of skepticism he had towards other psychical phenomena.Samuel, Lawrence.

But after their blowout loss to Missouri, they failed to receive any votes, and failed to show any improvement until the Michigan State game, which followed blowout losses to Penn State and Ohio State, but by late in the season, they were able to upset Michigan and Minnesota while also giving Cincinnati a game.
