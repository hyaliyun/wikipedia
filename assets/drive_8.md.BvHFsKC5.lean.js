In 1928, she received a Ph.D in Anthropology from the University of Chicago. Later on while working at Lingnan University in China during World War II she was taken prisoner by the Japanese when the US entered the war, but was released by 1942. After, she joined the United States Marine Corps and worked in the Office of Strategic Services until 1947 when she became an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency until her retirement in 1964. Chapman wrote an anthropological study titled Milocca: A Sicilian Village, which included a detailed account of daily life, traditions and even mysticism that would have been familiar to earlier generations of Sicilians but was about to be inexorably changed by the events of the twentieth century.Chapman CG.(1971) Milocca: A Sicilian Village. Cambridge, MA: Schenkman Pub. Co.  Education  Gower enrolled in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Chicago in 1924. Gower's M.A. and PhD research was heavily influenced by both Franz Boas' four-fields anthropology and Chicago School sociology. She served as a member of Fay-Cooper Cole's field survey work studying Illinois' prehistory for two years beginning in 1926, and presented on the work of the archaeological field party at the Central Section of the American Anthropological Association's Chicago meeting in 1927. Gower was awarded her master's degree in 1926 for her historical ethnology thesis on aboriginal West Indian cultures titled, \\"The Northern and Southern Affiliations of Antillean Culture.\\" She conducted her Ph.D. dissertation research among Chicago's Sicilian immigrant community, focusing initially on Sicilian religion and culture during that city's Prohibition era. However, Gower then departed for 18 months of field research, supported by a Social Science Research Council fellowship, in the remote Sicilian mountain village of Milocca, where she became fluent in both the local Sicilian dialect and standard Italian, and pursued her research goals despite the challenges of working as a woman in the field in early 20th century Italy. She received her Ph.D. in 1928, and was one of only two women awarded that degree from the University of Chicago's Department of Sociology and Anthropology during her four years of study at that institution.  Work  In Milocca, Gower not only describes the traditional aspects of the community in which she immersed herself, but also recorded and relayed the political tensions of the time between socialists and fascists, and described a 1920 uprising where local laborers took possession of six large estates. She also described the rise of the fascists to power throughout Italy at the time, and the role of the Sicilian Mafia in village life, with Milocca the site of a mass arrest of suspected mafiosi in January 1928. Gower's Milocca is considered a comprehensive community study focusing on social stratification, while also serving as an account of Sicilian kinship, religious beliefs and practices, including the annual processions of saints or festas, and remains one of the only accounts of Sicilian village life from the pre-war period, and is cited extensively in John Davis's People of the Mediterranean (1977). Charlotte Gower joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin in 1930 as an assistant professor, but left in 1938 to take a teaching position at Ling-Nan University in China.

The adventures of Lance Spearman was published in a weekly photo comic that went by the title African Film in East and West Africa and Spear Magazine in South Africa, and was featured in over one hundred and fifty issues. Lance Spearman was widely regarded as the James Bond of English speaking Africa from Kenya on the East Coast to South Africa, and across the West Coast in Nigeria and Ghana. At its zenith, Lance Spearman had over half a million fans across the continent until the series was discontinued in 1972. The fictional Spear is a sophisticated African super-spy, detective and superhero, all rolled into one, who sports a goatee, smokes expensive cigars, drinks Whisky on the rocks, and dresses in well tailored suits complete with a bow tie and a Panama hat. Spear likes buxom women and drives the Corvette Sting Ray. Spear is an expert marksman and is skilled at karate and boxing. Publication history =Creation and inspiration= In response to the Caucasian characters that dominated the market in the 1960s and 1970s, James Richard Abe Bailey was inspired to produce African Film. The magazine was a look-read or Photo-comic designed for Pan-African distribution and readership, and was published under the banner of Drum Publications of South Africa. Drum Publications bought the stories from local African students, and had them edited in Johannesburg, South Africa. Malcolm Dunkfeld, a white South African, was the editor in charge of the African Film in Johannesburg. The scripts were then sent to Swaziland, where photographers led by Stanley N. Bunn and Trevor Barrett took photos of black actors acting out the stories. The completed photographic strips were then sent to London, where they would be printed, before being shipped back to South Africa for distribution to West Africa, East Africa, and South Africa. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, several African nations had gained their independence from Europe. To avoid bias and conflict, the editors at Drum chose to make the stories non-racial and non-political. The editors also realized that the demographics across the continent were varied and readers in the different parts of the continent had specialized interests. Thus, Drum Publications published several editions of the magazine featuring Lance Spearman for different parts of the continent. In West and East Africa, the publication was published as African Film, and in South Africa, it was published as The Spear. In South Africa, Lance Spearman had a readership of approximately 20,000; 45,000 in East Africa and 100,000 in West Africa. P =Allies and Enemies= The Spear's loyal allies are his agile assistant \\"Sonia\\", who is capable of dispensing impressive karate kicks when in combat; a twelve-year-old sidekick known as \\"Lemmy\\" who uses a catapult as his primary weapon; and a uniformed Police Officer called \\"Captain Victor\\". His enemies are characters such as \\"The Cat\\", a burglar who climbs walls of tall buildings; \\"Dr. Devil\\", an evil genius whose electronic wizardry directs international experimental rockets off course; Rabon Zollo; Themermolls; and Countess Scarlett. Fighting styles and vehicles =Fighting Styles= The Spear uses reverse karate kicks, and his fists. His favored handgun is a Beretta that he refers to as \\"my little friend\\". =Vehicles= The Spear's favorite vehicle is the Corvette Sting Ray. Cultural impact The adventures of Lance Spearman catered to the new urban youth, who had left the villages for the cities in search of a better life. The Spear combined re-appropriated Western references with a distinctly African cultural identity. He reflected a newly defined black Atlantic modernity and fostered a post-colonial pride in them by portraying The Spear as an urbanite who eats, loves, fights, drinks, smokes, and talks with ease, style and self-confidence. The adventures of Lance Spearman were illustrated with stunning photographs instead of drawings, giving them the uniqueness, creative flair and do-it-yourself spirit common throughout Africa. They preceded the explosion of Blaxploitation in America in the 1970s and its budget conscious DIY techniques were the precursors of modern Nollywood movie making.

(2010). Aortic Valve Stenosis. Retrieved from: http://www.childrenshospital.org/health- topics/conditions/aortic-valve-stenosis The aortic valve is a one way valve that is located between the left ventricle and the aorta, keeping blood from leaking back into the ventricle. It has three leaflets that separate when the ventricle contracts to allow blood to move from the ventricle to the aorta. These leaflets come together when the ventricle relaxes. Mechanism Since the valve does not open properly in aortic stenosis, there is a decrease in the forward movement of blood into the aorta. Fetal aortic stenosis impairs left ventricular development, which can lead to hypoplastic left heart syndrome. If untreated, HLHS is lethal, as a result of the inability of the left heart to pump enough blood to sustain normal organ function. In fetal life, this is condition is manageable because the ductus arteriosus acts as a bypass, and supports the delivery of oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation. However, the ductus arteriosus closes during the first few days of life, resulting in systemic circulation failure in babies born with aortic valve stenosis. Diagnosis Fetal aortic valve stenosis can be diagnosed by echocardiography before birth. The diagnostic features include a poorly contracting left ventricle, aortic valve thickening/restriction, a varying degree of left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal Doppler flow characteristics in the left heart. There may be little or no detectable flow into or out of the left side of the heart. There are two screening periods, one during the first trimester and the other during the second trimester. Fetal aortic stenosis is typically detected between 18 and 24 weeks gestation. This early detection is important because it allows for parents to be counseled in a timely and rational manner, allowing for discussion of prognosis and possible outcomes. Another reason for this crucial early detection is because it allows for postnatal management planning. Treatment Intervention inutero may need to be done if there is concern that the aortic stenosis is severe enough to lead to the development of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Management before birth is done by a fetal aortic valvuloplasty. In this procedure, fetal positioning is crucial. It is important that the left chest is located anteriorly, and that there are no limbs between the uterine wall and the apex of the left ventricle. The LV apex needs to be within 9 cm of the abdominal wall and the left ventricle outflow track has to be parallel to the intended cannula course in order for the wire to be blindly directed at the aortic valve. An 11.5 cm long, 19-gauge cannula and stylet needle passes through the mother's abdomen, uterine wall, and fetal chest wall into the left ventricle of the fetus. Then a 0.014 inch guide wire is passed across the stenosis aortic valve, where a balloon is inflated to stretch the aortic annulus. Once born, critical or severe aortic stenosis is often treated through a less invasive catherization procedure knows as aortic valvuloplasty. Other options for newborns involve open heart surgery. Potential open heart surgeries may include aortic valve repair or the Ross procedure. If the fetal aortic stenosis is critical it may lead to hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) it is treated with the Norwood procedure. This typically consists of three surgeries creating and removing shunts. The atrial septum is removed, the aortic arch is reconstructed to remove any hypoplasia, and then the main pulmonary artery is connected into this reconstructed arch, resulting in the right ventricle ejecting directly into systemic circulation. the end result is the right ventricle pumping blood to both the body and to the lungs. An alternative to the Norwood procedure is known as the hybrid procedure, was developed in 2008. In the hybrid procedure, bilateral pulmonary artery bands are positioned to limit pulmonary flow while, at the same time, placing a stent in the ductus arteriosus to hold it open. This maintains the connection between the aorta and the systemic circulation. A balloon atrial septostomy is also done. This ensures that there is enough of a connection between the two atria of the heart to provide open blood flow and mixing of oxygen rich and poor bloodNationwide Children‚Äôs Hospital (2014). Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. Retrieved from: http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/hypoplastic-left-heart- syndrome This procedure spares the baby from undergoing open heart surgery until they are older. They typically come back at 4‚Äì6 months of age when they are stronger for the open heart surgery.

Parson is notable for her work in dance/theater, post- modern dance, and art popmusic. Parson is the Artistic Director of Brooklyn's Big Dance Theater, which she founded with Molly Hickok and her husband, Paul Lazar. She is also well known for her collaborations with Mikhail Baryshnikov, David Byrne, David Bowie, St. Vincent, Laurie Anderson, Jonathan Demme, Ivo van Hove, Sarah Ruhl, Lucas Hnath, Wendy Whelan, David Lang, Esperanza Spalding, Mark Dion, Salt ‚Äòn Pepa, Nico Muhly, and the Martha Graham Dance Co.  Early life and education  Parson received her BA in Dance from Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut in 1980. She received her Masters Degree Columbia University/Teacher‚Äôs College in 1983. Big Dance Theater Parson founded Big Dance Theater in 1991 with Molly Hickok and Paul Lazar. She has since choreographed and co-created dozens of works for the company, ranging from pure dance pieces to adaptations of plays and literature, to original works combining wildly disparate materials. Her work with Big Dance has been commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, The National Theater of Paris, The Japan Society, and The Walker Art Center. Parson describes Big Dance as \\"a group of people who are interested in pushing dance into the theatrical realm and pushing theater into the dance realm.\\" To her, Big Dance has a \\"total greediness for all the pleasures of theater and dance\\" Critic Helen Shaw wrote of Big Dance as a \\"fluid gang of performers and designers clustered around the married co-directors, choreographer-director Annie-B Parson and actor-director Paul Lazar. The company is ‚Äì as it says on the bottle ‚Äì a hybrid group, ignoring customary divides between dance and theatre.\\" The Company began as a loose but dedicated and generative alliance, made up largely of women including Stacy Dawson, Molly Hickok, Tymberly Canale, Cynthia Hopkins, Rebecca Wisocky, and Kourtney Rutherford. This group ebbed and flowed with others joining in over the years. The work of Big Dance is almost always non-linear, and frequently disinclined to have a narrative (\\"I don‚Äôt think life is very narrative,\\" Parson says. \\"Mine isn‚Äôt. And the narrative elements that have happened in my life, as I look back on them, become more fictionalized.\\") Though the lack of a linear story occasionally leaves critics bewildered, the intentionality, playfulness, technical precision and the ambitious scope of the worlds they create usually guarantees that the critic don't mind feeling lost. In the words of Shaw, \\"the difference between a Big Dance Theater event and work by someone like, say, Richard Foreman is that Big Dance will send you into a trance state-and then shake its finger at you and wink.\\" When asked about the division between theater and dance, Parson said: > \\"The separation of dance and theater- this is a lifelong irritant for me! In > my personal and very subjective timeline, the distrust in Western theater of > dance all began post-18th c. Since then, we audience(s) have been > increasingly subjected to mind-numbing, un-ironic, unambiguous ‚Äúreality‚Äù on > stage. The Ancients, 2000 years ago, those plays were all danced and sung; > in Shakespeare‚Äôs day- the actors danced; in classical Japanese theater the > acting students begin with years of dance training. Our contemporary body- > less, dance-less theater‚Äì it feels fear based, (but I tend to think > everything is fear based so don‚Äôt trust me on that!) But is it related to > our Victorian fear of the body, fear of corporeality, of sex? Does the > divorce stem from our bias of mind over body, rather than mind/body? But > yes, the separation must have also to do with the modernists‚Äô hierarchical > crowning of the primacy of ‚Äúthe word‚Äù; the modernists held the word as > honorable, while poor dance was considered tawdry, the work of whores and ‚Ä¶ > women! The things that dance owns: ambiguity, layer, mystery, abstraction, > the non-narrative‚Äî these are the work of the devil! They hide, they suggest, > they imply, they don‚Äôt have a morality or any answers. So, in my tiny > corner, I have tried to resurrect dance in theater. Dance is the sacred > object for me; it is to be held close and protected from harm, and restored > to its rightful place in the pantheon of materiality.\\" = Works with Big Dance Theater =  Sacrifice (1991)  Sacrifice was the first of Parson's large scale works and her first work at Dance Theater Workshop, curated by David White, who would champion Parson's work for decades. Set in something like a beauty parlor, this piece incorporated some text from Harold Pinter and was accompanied by a score of repetitive gestures executed by five pairs of men and women.  The Gag (1993)  The Gag premiered at Dance Theater Workshop in 1993. This large-scale work was based on the myth of the Cassandra figure in Greek mythology and the piece incorporated the text of radical feminist writer Andrea Dworkin. Molly Hickok played the central role, starting a decades-long collaboration between her and Parson. The piece was also inspired by the writings Christa Wolff with text by Aeschylus, Pinter and Marguerite Yourcenar. It featured original music by Walter Tompson, performed live. Four monitors on the floor included footage of small scampering animal babies. The New York Times described The Gag as ‚Äúa bouillabaisse of a theater-dance piece‚Ä¶There‚Äôs a little Greek tragedy, a bit of Harold Pinter, a dab of Tennessee Williams and a large dose of fashion and comic high jinks.‚Äù  Bremen Freedom (1993)  Presented by the Cucaracha Theater, and originally made for NYU Students, Bremen Freedom, by the west- German playwright Rainer Fassbinder, told the story of Geesche, a woman so sick of being controlled by the men in her life that she methodically poisoned them, and ultimately herself. The Village Voice wrote that the production included ‚Äúa little cabaret shtick, some cross-dressing, a few dollops of disjunction, plenty of stylized tableau-making, a pinch of Catholic imagery, several actresses playing the same role, a bit of lovely/creepy choral singing, and heaps of that unmotivated goofy dancing that made Brace Up such a hoot.‚Äù Although the reviews referenced some of the performative similarities to Cabaret, (Stacy Dawson as the Master of Ceremonies recalled Joel Grey), the Village Voice insisted that ‚Äúthese kids come on like innovators, not imitators, and they know how to deliver a spectacle piping hot.‚Äù Though highly choreographic, this work was the first ‚Äúplay‚Äù that Big Dance, a largely dance based company, had staged.  City of Brides (1995)  In 1995, Parson was featured in the Young Choreographers and Composers at the American Dance Festival in North Carolina. She was paired with composer Richard Einhorn and the two created ‚ÄúCity of Brides,‚Äù performed by five barefoot women and accompanied by a complex score for piano, violin and cello based on Stravinsky's Les Noces. This would be the first ‚Äúerasure‚Äù work, Parson's term for choreographing to a piece of music and then erasing it, so that while the music was never heard by the audience, the movement material that was inspired by his rhythms endured. The News & Observer wrote that ‚ÄúParson is a talent to be reckoned with.‚Äù A reviewer for the Toronto Arts Journal CallTime wrote that Parson was the ‚Äúmost refreshing voice among a new generation of choreographers,‚Äù and that her blend of dance and theater had ‚Äúcreated a movement language which is accessible to any audience member regardless of age, race, gender, or previous knowledge of dance‚Äù The piece also played at the Dance Theater Workshop in NYC (1995), Fall for Dance Festival in NYC (2004), and the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, South Carolina.  Don Juan Comes Back from the War (1996)  Don Juan Comes Back from the War premiered at Classic Stage Company NYC in 1996. It was a joint production by the Classic Stage Company and the Cucaracha Theater, with Lazar and Parson as co-directors and her choreographing. The New York Times lauded their direction, writing that they had constructed a ‚Äúwitty and elegant interpretation‚Äù of Odon von Horvath‚Äôs bittersweet play. The play follows Don Juan as he returns home from the first World War in search of his fianc√©, who, unbeknownst to him, has died. Her ghost follows him throughout the play. Horvath, a Hungarian playwright who wrote in Germany until he fled the Nazi‚Äôs, set his play in the immediate aftermath of World War One, but the play is full of ‚Äúphilosophical jibes‚Äù at his enemies. Parson and Lazar animated these ideas with ‚Äúhighly stylized choreography and musical arrangements‚Äù (by Christopher Berg) that allude to both Don Juan and popular German music of the 1920s. The result might have annoyed Horvath, who was notoriously fussy about staging, but they probably let an American audience grasp his meaning, and certainly his moods, better than any more literal presentation could.\\"  A Simple Heart (1997)  This dance-theater adaptation of Gustave Flaubert‚Äôs A Simple Heart follows the story of F√©licit√©, a servant who watches as every being she is connected to slowly dies or leaves her. Parson cast two dancers (Stacy Dawson and Molly Hickock) as F√©licit√©, who occasionally danced in unison, parallel, and sometimes split entirely while always remaining connected. They separate for the first time when F√©licit√© dies. The piece employed minimal use of language, instead relying on ‚Äúspare yet rich vignettes‚Äù to tell this simple story with a dry tenderness, intended to match the tonality of the Flaubert. The Village Voice wrote that Parson and Lazar had created a ‚Äúcold, compelling world of emotional disintegration.‚Äù A Simple Heart premiered at the GIFT Festival in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 1997. It was also performed at the Dance Theater Workshop, NYC, Classic Stage Company, NYC, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Massachusetts, the Hitchcock Center, Dartmouth New Hampshire, Middlebury College in Vermont, Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and the Spoleto Festival in South Carolina.  Girl Gone (1998)  Girl Gone, written by Mac Wellman with songs by Cynthia Hopkins, premiered at the Flea Theater in 1998, and ran at the Kitchen NYC in 1999. The play explores the possibility of constructing alternate realities as three teenage girls, Lissa, Lisa, and Elyssa, perform rituals with the goal of ‚Äúgoing away‚Äù to a fantasy land. They are so successful that they bring much of the rest of their world with them. In an article from the Village Voice, Parson and Lazar's working relationship was described as so close that theaters are often unsure of how to credit their work. For Girl Gone, Parson dreamed up dances inspired by Wellman's fanciful stage directions; ‚ÄúThey do the Spinal Fusion,‚Äù writes Wellman, ‚ÄúThey do the Full Cleveland.‚Äù In describing the play, Time Out New York gave up on theatrical labels and instead turned to psychological terminology, writing that ‚Äúthe work is schizophrenic, manic, occasionally melancholic and, more often, hysteric.‚Äù Watching it was ‚Äúboth an alienating and enchanting experience.‚Äù  Another Telepathic Thing (2000)  Another Telepathic Thing was inspired by Mark Twain‚Äôs morality tale ‚ÄúThe Mysterious Stranger,‚Äù and is described as ‚Äúa prismatic and complex dance-theater parable.‚Äù It was performed by Tymberly Canale, Stacy Dawson, Molly Hickok, Cynthia Hopkins, Paul Lazar, and David Neumann, and featured original music by Cynthia Hopkins. ‚ÄúAt once cynical and spiritual, the work centers on a charismatic stranger whose visit shatters the peace of a mythic hamlet. The medieval setting is echoed by a contemporary Hollywood reality, with a script that braids Twain‚Äôs sublime writing with ‚Äòfound‚Äô text from years of auditions. It culminates in a subtle and startling exploration of the fragility of our human condition.‚Äù The piece was performed at Dance Theater Workshop NYC, (2000), STUC Theater, Belgium, (2000), Performing Garage NYC (2000), Rotterdam, Ghent and Munster, Germany (2001), and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis Minnesota (2002), where it was the first in the Walker‚Äôs 2002 showcase of genre-bending performances aptly titled the ‚ÄúOut There‚Äù series. The end of the piece, in which Satan delivers a final address that describes human existence as nothing but ‚Äúa homeless thought‚Äù and then disappears, was described by the Star Tribune as a \\"powerful, unflinching conclusion to this ontological meditation‚Äù The show was also extremely well received in Germany. Reviewer Susanne Lang described the stage as ‚Äúa snow-globe that can be shaken to see the world, at least for a moment, through the dreamlike flurry of artificial snowflakes‚Ä¶everything is moving, everything is carried by the music.‚Äù The M√ºnstersche Zeitung lauded the piece as a ‚Äúhighly successful mix of dance- and spoken-theater‚Ä¶acoustic spaces are created through speech and song, which seamlessly create a superstructure for the dance. By bringing this piece, Pumpenhaus has not only brought a premier to M√ºnster, it has brought an exceptional piece of dance theater.‚Äù Jonathan Demme filmed a live performance of the piece in 2000 at Dance Theater Workshop in NYC. The film was screened at the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York in June 2015. In 2000 Big Dance won an Obie for the music in Another Telepathic Thing. This piece, considered a signature Big Dance work, was made into a book published by 53 State Press, which includes the text of the piece, drawings by Parson of the costumes and props, and interviews with the performers about how the work was generated.  Antigone (2002)  In 2002 Big Dance Theater created an adaptation of Antigone, their second collaboration with playwright Mac Wellman. It premiered at Dance Theater Workshop in New York and toured to On the Boards in Seattle, Washington, UCLA Live in Los Angeles, Kampnagel in Hamburg, Germany, Theater im Pumpenhaus in Muenster, Germany, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Illinois and Classic Stage Company in New York, NY. The New York Times called the show a \\"a curious and mesmerizing if largely impenetrable experience,\\" and said that Parson had created movement \\"whose sprightly intelligence is itself meaning enough.\\"  Plan B (2004)  Plan B, an original piece with text by Len Jenkin and the company, premiered in 2004 at the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis. \\"As in a well-cooked dish,\\" wrote the New York Times, ‚Äúingredients blend in works by the Big Dance Theater, creating elusive flavors and textures.‚Äù Plan B combined elements from Nixon's Watergate tapes and the adult diaries of Kaspar Hauser, the 19th century ‚Äúwild child‚Äù who was found at age 16 at the gates of the city of Nuremberg, after living abandoned in a German forest for 12 years. His subsequent socialization proved tragic. Lazar explained that the two texts connected when they discovered a section of the tapes where Nixon and his advisors were trying to find the right person to do certain things on their behalf. ‚ÄúWhat a perfect foil Kaspar might be,‚Äù said Lazar, ‚Äúbecause he‚Äôs so malleable and so innocent.‚Äù Add to those elements bits of the Old Testament, Kabuki dance and Taiwanese movie music and you have ‚ÄòPlan B,‚Äô ‚Äúa shimmering strand of evocative storytelling that manages to suggest a great deal about innocence in all its guises.‚Äù ‚ÄúCombining all these disparate sources might have been a recipe for disaster in the wrong hands,‚Äù writes Susan Reiter for the danceviewtimes, ‚Äúbut Big Dance Theater blends and transforms them with a sureness of vision... creating a work that tells a quirky, ambiguous tale with resonant strangeness and delicate beauty.‚Äù Plan B also played at the Bonn Biennale in Germany (2004), Dance Theater Workshop NYC (2004), Under the Radar Festival in NYC (2005), and the Philadelphia Live Arts Festival in PA (2005).  The Other Here (2007)  The Other Here was an original work based on the writing of Masuji Ibuse. It was commissioned by the Japan Society, who asked that the piece in some way be engaged with Japanese culture. The director of the Japan society, Yoko Shioya, suggested they consider the works of Masuji Ibuse. Parson and her team began with a selection of source materials- the Chekhovian stories of Ibuse, verbatim text from transcripts of American life insurance conferences, traditional Japanese dances, Japanese pop music, a large table and a zither. Slowly, through collective exploration, the themes between these disparate materials are discovered, and a story begins to emerge. A man trying to give a speech at a conference is interrupted to watch a hand clapping dance, to perform a dance of his own, and to receive the gift of a fish. The fish becomes central. Theatre Forum noted that the piece, exists at that point of collision between form and substance‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe intricacy of that subtle emotional palette is one of [its] great strengths.\\" The Other Here was developed at the CUNY Festival of New Work in NYC, 2005. It then played at Lincoln Center Out of Doors (2006) and at the University of Maryland (2006). Its official premiere was at The Japan Society in February 2007.  Comme Toujours Here I Stand (2009)  This original piece was inspired by Agn√®s Varda's 1962 French Nouvelle Vague black-and-white film, Cleo From 5 to 7, and was commissioned by the French Institute Alliance Fran√ßaise. The film follows Cleo, a young pop singer anxiously awaiting the results of a biopsy test for cancer. The film follows her in nearly real time for two hours, as she distracts herself with composers, lovers, friends, a fortune teller, and a soldier. The Big Dance production simultaneously honored, appropriated, reinvented, and departed from the model of the film. In the words of Philip Lopate, writing for the Performance Arts Journal, Parson ‚Äúzeroes in on the very French (think of La Rochefoucauld) theme of humanity's egotistical cruelty.‚Äù When creating the piece, Parson used the screenplay, but didn't watch the film itself until late in the process, so as not to be (in the words of Lazar) ‚Äúunder the claw‚Äù of Varda's influence. The New York Times wrote that in the piece, ‚Äúmeaning accrues from a complex yet spare interplay of actions and objects: a French folk song, video by Jeff Larson, luscious costumes and props evoking French couture, even a razzle-dazzle dance routine that refers to choreography from a Godard film.‚Äù The piece premiered in Les Subsistance‚Äôs √áa Tchatche Festival in April in Lyon, France. It also played at Le Quartz in Brest, France, Le Theatre National in Rennes, France, MCA/Chicago, The Kitchen, NYC October 2009, and New York Live Arts, NYC. It is a signature work of the Company and the entire company and design team won a Bessie for it in 2010.  Supernatural Wife (2010)  During a residency at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles in 2010, Parson and Lazar began working on Supernatural Wife, an adaptation of Euripides' play Alkestis. Parson edited the translation by Anne Carson to create a spare skeleton for the piece. The play is based on the myth of King Admetus, who is offered eternal life by Apollo on the condition that he send a surrogate to the underworld in his stead. His wife, Alcestis, volunteers. Parson describes the subject matter as primal: \\"matters of birth, death, grief, mourning and the gods.\\" Supernatural Wife had its American premiere at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 2011. Ella Buff, the festival's executive and artistic director, noted that ‚Äúby integrating material from far-flung sources, [Parson and Lazar] create their own mythology.‚Äù The piece pulled from Yiddish silent films, the physical score from Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis routines, video footage of a horse wrangler and a recording of a monologue by Rosalind Russell. Annie-B Parson made her Brooklyn Academy of Music debut in the Harvey Theater with Supernatural Wife in 2011. The piece toured to La Filature in Mulhouse, France, Les Subsistances in Lyon, France, Le Quartz in Brest, France, Th√©√¢tre National de Chaillot in Paris, France, and the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis, MN.  Ich, Kurbisgeist (2012)  Ich, Kurbisgeist was co-commissioned by The Chocolate Factory and Performance Space 122. It premiered in October 2012 at the Chocolate Factory in Queens New York, and later played at NYLA in 2013. The show was created in collaboration with Playwright Sibyl Kempson, and was written in a language invented by the playwright, which no one in the world, except those involved in the production, speaks‚Äîor has any knowledge of.‚Äù This ‚Äúimpressively inscrutable‚Äù play is, in the words of the playwright, an ‚Äúolde- tyme agricultural vengeance play for Hallowe‚Äôen.‚Äù The piece was set in the Middle Ages, in a largely barren land that seems to produce nothing but pumpkins, many of which were to be smashed during the performance. When asked how Ich, Kurbisgeist fit into the history of what Big Dance does, Parson said she craved doing something where language was abstract as movement, something ‚Äútiny and intimate\\" and felt it should be seen \\"in some kind of site-specific, really, really intimate venue. I thought it needed to be something that you‚Äôre very close to, so you‚Äôre not just thinking of language as meaning, but you‚Äôre also thinking of language as a kinetic experience, because the language is extremely kinetic.‚Äù Writing for L Magazine, Alexis Clements noted that Parson and Lazar seem to ‚Äúenjoy feeling like outsiders looking in on a culture or subject that they are not familiar with.‚Äù For them, there was a ‚Äúvalue in the experience of having to acknowledge one‚Äôs own ignorance,‚Äù it freed them to take in information that contradicted their previous ways of thinking, it allowed them to do something familiar in a wholly new way. The New York Times wrote that ‚ÄúMuch like the words spoken by Shakespeare‚Äôs wily fools, the messages are scrambled. Yet the world of ‚ÄúIch, K√ºrbisgeist‚Äù is whole, and surprisingly powerful. Sometimes the gut understands better than the brain.‚Äù  Man in a Case (2013)  Man in a Case, Parson‚Äôs collaboration with dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, premiered in 2013 at Hartford Stage and ironically featured Baryshnikov, considered the greatest dancer of his generation, as a man who refuses to dance. Parson choreographed and directed the piece, which used her original adaptations of two lesser known Chekhov short stories, ‚ÄúMan in a Case‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbout Love‚Äù, in combination with live music, dance, and surveillance-style video footage. Baryshnikov's performance was widely lauded, and Elizabeth Bruce described the \\"melancholy crispness\\" of the performance as \\"utterly Chekhovian.\\" The piece was performed at Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C., Berkeley Repertory Theatre in Berkeley, CA, ArtsEmerson in Boston MA, Broad Stage in Santa Monica, CA, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, IL.  Alan Smithee Directed This Play: a Triple Feature (2014)  Alan Smithee Directed This Play: a Triple Feature was co- commissioned by Les Subsistances (Lyon) and Brooklyn Academy of Music. It premiered at Les Subsistances in France in March, 2014 and then played at Jacobs Pillow, Les Subsistances, Tanz im August Berlin and Brooklyn Academy of Music. The piece was an adaptation/ mashup of the films Terms of Endearment, Le Cercle Rouge, and Doctor Zhivago. It began when Les Subsistances suggested Annie-B Parson and Paul Lazar work with a short excerpt from the 1970 Franco- Italian crime film, Le Cercle Rouge. Wanting to work with other iconic films from other time periods and countries, they added Doctor Zhivago and Terms of Endearment. In classic Big Dance form, the piece wove together disparate performance styles, and included seven performers speaking text, dancing, and precisely performing the movements of actors from the films, which were, in turn, being projected on a large wall of blinds behind them. A moment of theatrical staging might be accompanied by an entire score of choreography, a dance might be underscored by fully staged theater. Parson says she is most interested in ‚Äúsimultaneous systems putting pressure on each other, and seeing what happens. That‚Äôs the magic point.‚Äù The name in the title, Alan Smithee, is the pseudonym used by the Directors Guild of America until 2000, when a director became so dissatisfied with a film that they could satisfactorily prove to the guild they had not been able to exercise creative control and therefore refused to take credit for the final product. He was then credited as Alan Smithee.  Short Form (2015)  Short form had its New York premiere at the Kitchen in January 2015, and was in part a celebration of the company's 25th anniversary. The show included five short works that focused on dance. The intermission was an onstage birthday party complete with games, food, and Lazar as M.C. The show was ‚ÄúInspired by disciplines of the concise ‚Äî novellas, folk tales, diary entries, pencil drawings, thumbnail sketches and the single page of a notebook,‚Äù and featured five works, that ‚Äúembrace the brief, granular, close range, anecdotal and microscopic. Downsizing is prized.‚Äù The piece had its world premiere at the Solange MacArthur Theater in the American Dance Institute in Rockville, MD in 2015. Its New York premiere was at the Kitchen in New York, NY, and it toured to the Fusebox Festival in Austin, Texas.  This Page Intentionally Left Blank (2016)  This Page Intentionally Left Blank made its world premiere at the University of Houston Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts‚Äô CounterCurrent Festival 2016. This performance-based docent tour deconstructed ‚Äúthe role of the docent and museum audio tour via an encounter with theater and dance, subverting and reconsidering how the docent typically leads viewers to observe art in the museum context.‚Äù Big Dance sought to democratize the museum space, to ‚Äúdisrupt, awaken, dismantle, confuse and thus revivify the viewer‚Äôs perception of art.‚Äù The audience wore headphones and toured the space in groups in groups of twenty, as the docent (Tymberly Canale) spoke about the art with a (‚Äúdon‚Äôt look at that,‚Äù she says at one point, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not part of the tour.‚Äù) The audience traveled from the Menil Collection's main building to Flavin's Untitled, 1996, described by Arts And Culture as ‚Äúa kind of journey deeper into Tymberly‚Äôs psyche as she worms her way into our own.‚Äù Movement and theater gradually begin to take over the piece, and ultimately, the audience became part of the performance. The piece was also performed at Mass MoCa- the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, in January 2016.  17c (2017)  17c is the newest Big Dance Theater ensemble work, built around the problematic 17th-century diaries of Samuel Pepys. Pepys danced, sang, strummed, shopped, strove, bullied and groped ‚Äî and he recorded all of it in his diary, completely unfiltered. From his bunions, to his infidelities, to his perversions, to his meetings with the King, he needed to get his daily life down on paper, or he felt lost. A startling precursor to our own social media culture, Pepys possessed a similar compulsion to assign an almost constant real-time meaning to his daily existence, to examine himself, and obsessively report it.\\" In her latest piece, Parson and her team incorporated the copious diaries of Pepys', Margaret Cavendish‚Äôs 17th-century radical feminist play The Convent of Pleasure, three centuries of marginalia, and the ongoing annotations of the web-based devotees at www.pepysdiary.com. The piece \\"dismantles an unchallenged historical figure and embodies the women's voices omitted from Pepys' intimate portrait of his life\\" 17c was presented as a work in progress excerpt as part of the American Realness Festival at Gibney Dance's Agnes Varis Performing Arts Center in January 2017. It then played at the Philadelphia Fringe Festival September 7‚Äì9. In October it was presented at Mass MoCa, co-presented by Jacob's Pillow Dance in North Adams MA. Its world premiere was in November 2017 at the Carolina Performing Arts in Chapel Hill, NC, and its New York Premiere was at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival in Brooklyn New York in November 2017. Other notable projects Outside of Big Dance, Ms. Parson has created choreography for marching bands, operas, pop stars, theater, ballet, docents, movies, objects, television, symphonies, and most recently for a chorus of 1,000 singers under the direction of Simon Halsey. Her work for theater, MTV, opera and film includes work by Laurie Anderson, Salt n Pepa, Nico Muhly, and such plays as Lucas Hnath's Walt Disney at Soho Rep, Sarah Ruhl's Orlando, Futurity at ART, as well as the string quartet ETHEL. = Here Lies Love (2013) = In 2013, Parson choreographed Here Lies Love, a musical based on Fillipina First Lady Imelda Marco‚Äôs life that played at the Public Theater with music by David Byrne. Parson had been a fan of Byrne's since she had seen him perform in her college days. Admiration became collaboration; she choreographed two of Byrne‚Äôs world tours even before they began working on Here Lies Love. Byrne wrote the lyrics, and the music was created by Byrne and Fatboy Slim. Of the process, which was her first foray into traditional musical theater, she said: ‚ÄúUsually, in my own company or other concert work, I create from a formalist perspective, meaning I work with line, space, shape, and the time of dance itself. Dance is the sacred object. When I‚Äôve created for David‚Äôs concerts, I ask, ‚ÄòWhat does the music crave?‚Äô But in Here Lies Love, the music and story are the top contenders for the throne, so I knew the dance had to serve those two. Therein lies the struggle‚Äî and the interest‚Äî for me in this project.\\" Parson studied Marco‚Äôs movements, riffing on her trademark moves to create choreography so that the audience could see her signature gestures both live and on the TV screens playing historical footage. The resulting choreography offered diverse phrases that had ‚Äúeverything from boy-band step touches and hard-hitting club moves to gestural sections with lotus-flower hands and swaying luau hip circles.‚Äù The resulting mishmash created a striking visual effect, which was at this point known as a ‚ÄúParson trademark.‚Äù Parson said that her way of working came from Merce Cunningham who ‚Äúoffered that sequencing and hierarchy of movement aren‚Äôt important. I can do one move, then another, then roll the dice and switch it up.‚Äù The New York Times called her choreography \\"wildly diverse and witty.\\"  Full list of other works  Ms. Parson created choreography for the Love This Giant Tour by David Byrne and St. Vincent, and for the Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour in 2008‚Äì2009. She also created dance for the Digital Witness Tour by St. Vincent in 2014‚Äì2016. She directed and choreographed for the string quartet Ethel. Her dances are featured in the film Ride, Rise, Roar about David Byrne. She choreographed for Nico Muhly's opera Dark Sisters, Walt Disney at Soho Rep, Sarah Ruhl's Orlando, Futurity at ART, The Broken Heart at TFNA, David Bowie's Lazarus, full-length work for The Martha Graham Dance Co. and a solo for Wendy Whelan at The Linbury/Royal Opera House * \\"I used to love you\\" (2017) Choreographed by Parson for the Martha Graham Dance Co, this work was based on Graham's rarely seen 1941 Punch and Judy. It served to re-think and deconstruct the Graham choreography. * The Road Awaits Us (2017): Created for the Elixir Co, a company of Elders at Sadlers Wells in London, this work was born from Parson's fascination with absurdism in an absurdist age. Parson created a very skeletal and non-linear edit of Ionesco's The Bald Soprano for the Elixir Co. The performers ranged in age from 60‚Äì89, a group of veteran and loved dancers in the London scene. Parson ended the work with a slim edit of the elegiac fourth act of The Cherry Orchard. * Short Ride Out (2016) A solo for Wendy Whelan for The Royal Ballet, this short solo was danced to the music of Julia Wolf.

She was born on October 14, 1971, in the town of Tassin-la-Demi-Lune. Tassin-la-Demi-Lune is in the south east of France close to Lyon. The population was less than 25,000 people when she was born there. She has three sisters and one brother. Both of her parents are musicians and passed their passion down to their children. Her father composes pieces and her mother plays the piano. Her musical career started at the age of four when she began playing one of her sister's cellos as well as began studying the piano and oboe. Her first televised concert with an orchestra was at the age of ten where she was a soloist (1981). One year after her televised solo, Gastinel entered the Lyons Conservatory School to begin her formal music education. At age 15 (1986), Gastinel finished first place in her class at the Musical Conservatory School in Lyon, France. After her time in Lyon she moved on to study at the more advanced National Musical Conservatory in Paris. In Paris her teachers included famous musicians and fellow cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Paul Tortelier, and J√°nos Starker; all of whom made their impression on her and her musical style. In 1990 Gastinel competed on the Eurovision Tournament in Vienna, where she represented France. She has participated in many more international contests since then and has done extremely well in several including the Cheveningen, Prague, and Rostropovich Competitions. Gastinel was the first French artist to reach the finals in the Prague International Competition in forty years and won first place in the International Competition of Scheveningen. By the young age of 18 (1989), this child prodigy had already performed in more than 50 cities all over Europe. Later on she began a worldwide solo career. She has traveled worldwide around many different continents such as Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas and has won many prizes for her work. She has played at many famous musical halls around the world during her years of touring. Some of the more notable venues are Santori Hall in Tokyo Japan, Victoria Hall in Geneva Switzerland, Berlin Konzerthaus in Germany, the Th√©√¢tre des Champs Elys√©es in Paris France, and Victoria Hall in London England. Gastinel has been awarded many prizes for her performances and albums. She was named ‚ÄúVictore of Music‚Äù in all three categories of competition; most inspirational, best track of the year, and soloist of the year. She is the only musician who has completed this feat. She also has received awards early on in her musical career such as ‚ÄúMost Promising Young Talent‚Äù in 1994 and Best Recording of the year in 1995 as well as the Prix-Fnac in 1995 and 2000. She was named ‚ÄúWoman of Gold‚Äù in 2002 for her work in the performing arts category. In 1997, Gastinel was named the Ambassador of French cello and thus was chosen to play Pablo Casal's Goffriller cello (valued at 5 million francs) for one year by Pablo Casal's wife, New Yorker Marta Casals-Istomin. Currently, she plays on a 1690 Testore cello given to her by the Fonds Instrumental Francais Association. She has recorded 14 albums since 1989 and many of them have been collaborations. She is mainly associated with the recording label Naive but she has also worked with the record labels Valois and Ottavo. Gastinel has worked with several pianists including Fran√ßois-Fr√©d√©ric Guy on several different albums and Claire D√©sert on her album Schubert: Arpeggione in 2006. She has also collaborated with a guitarist named Pablo Marquez on her Spanish influenced album, Iberica, in 2009. Gastinel mainly plays classical and baroque music and has played many pieces by famous musicians such as Haydn, Rachmaninov, Brahms, Strauss, Dvorak, Bach, Beethoven, and Debussy. Gastinel is still an active musician and has been invited to be a soloist at the Choeur Britten concert on the 15th of April this year (2014). Gastinel has played famous pieces in famous concert halls, she has played under the direction of several famous conductors, and she also has played with many other talented musicians including but not limited to German conductor Kurt Sanderling, French conductor Emmanuel Krivine, Russian conductor Semyon Bychkov, Israeli conductor Pinchas Steinberg, Russian violinist Yuri Bashmet, and English violinist Lord Yehudi Menuhin. Gastinel is now not only a musician but has also been a professor of cello in Lyon at the National Conservatory of Music and Dance since 2003. This is the same school she started her formal musical education at many years earlier. In an interview Gastinel described the essence of music as the joy of personal exchange and sharing passion. She is married, has two children, Jules and Madeline, and still lives in Lyon.

Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author. It captures feeding disorders and eating disorders of clinical severity that do not meet diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), pica, or rumination disorder.American Psychiatric Association (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing. OSFED includes five examples: * atypical anorexia nervosa, * atypical bulimia nervosa of low frequency and/or limited duration, * binge eating disorder of low frequency and/or limited duration, * purging disorder, and * night eating syndrome (NES). Classification The five OSFED examples that can be considered eating disorders include atypical AN, BN (of low frequency and/or limited duration), BED (of low frequency and/or limited duration), purging disorder, and NES. Of note, OSFED is not limited to these five examples, and can include individuals with heterogeneous eating disorder presentations (i.e., OSFED- other). Another term, Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder (UFED), is used to describe individuals for whom full diagnostic criteria are not met but the reason remains unspecified or the clinician does not have adequate information to make a more definitive diagnosis. ;Atypical anorexia nervosa: In atypical AN, individuals meet all of the criteria for AN, with the exception of the weight criterion: the individual's weight remains within or above the normal range, despite significant weight loss. ;Atypical bulimia nervosa: In this sub-threshold version of BN, individuals meet all criteria for BN, with the exception of the frequency criterion: binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors occur, on average, less than once a week and/or for fewer than 3 months. ;Binge-eating disorder of low frequency and/or limited duration: In this sub-threshold version of BED, individuals must meet all criteria for BED, with the exception of the frequency criterion: binge eating occurs, on average, less than once a week and/or for fewer than 3 months. ;Purging disorder: In purging disorder, purging behavior aimed to influence weight or shape is present, but in the absence of binge eating. ;Night eating syndrome: In NES, individuals have recurrent episodes of eating at night, such as eating after awakening from sleep or excess calorie intake after the evening meal. This eating behavior is not culturally acceptable by group norms, such as the occasional late-night munchies after a gathering. NES includes an awareness and recall of the eating, is not better explained by external influences such as changes in the individual's sleep-wake cycle, and causes significant distress and/or impairment of functioning. Though not defined specifically in DSM-5, research criteria for this diagnosis proposed adding the following criteria (1) the consumption of at least 25% of daily caloric intake after the evening meal and/or (2) evening awakenings with ingestions at least twice per week.Allison K.C., Lundgren J.D., O'Reardon J.P., Martino N.S., Sarwer D.B., Wadden T.A., Stunkard A.J. (2008). \\"The Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ): Psychometric properties of a measure of severity of the night eating syndrome\\". Eating Behaviors, 9(1), 62-72. Treatment Few studies guide the treatment of individuals with OSFED. However, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on the interplay between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, has been shown to be the leading evidence-based treatment for the eating disorders of BN and BED.Fairburn C.G., Cooper Z., Shafran R. (2003). \\"Cognitive behaviour therapy for eating disorders: a 'transdiagnostic' theory and treatment\\". Behaviour Research and Therapy, 41(5), 509-28. For OSFED, a particular cognitive behavioral treatment can be used called CBT-Enhanced (CBT-E), which was designed to treat all forms of eating disorders. This method focuses not only what is thought to be the central cognitive disturbance in eating disorders (i.e., over-evaluation of eating, shape, and weight), but also on modifying the mechanisms that sustain eating disorder psychopathology, such as perfectionism, core low self-esteem, mood intolerance, and interpersonal difficulties. CBT-E showed effectiveness in two studies (total N = 219) and well maintained over 60-week follow-up periods.Fairburn C.G. & Wilson G.T. (2013). \\"The Dissemination and Implementation of Psychological Treatments: Problems and Solutions\\". International Journal of Eating Disorders, 46(5), 516-21. CBT-E is not specific to individual types of eating disorders but is based on the concept that common mechanisms are involved in the persistence of atypical eating disorders, AN, and BN. Epidemiology Few studies to date have examined OSFED prevalence. The largest community study is by Stice (2013),Stice E., Marti C.N., Rohde P. (2013). \\"Prevalence, incidence, impairment, and course of the proposed DSM-5 eating disorder diagnoses in an 8-year prospective community study of young women\\". Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 122(2), 445-57. who examined 496 adolescent females who completed annual diagnostic interviews over 8 years. Lifetime prevalence by age 20 for OSFED overall was 11.5%. 2.8% had atypical AN, 4.4% had subthreshold BN, 3.6% had subthreshold BED, and 3.4% had purging disorder. Peak age of onset for OSFED was 18‚Äì20 years. NES was not assessed in this study, but estimates from other studies suggest that it presents in 1% of the general population.Milano W, De Rosa M, Milano L, Capasso A (2012). \\"Night eating syndrome: an overview\\". Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, 64(1), 2-10. A few studies have compared the prevalence of EDNOS and OSFED and found that though the prevalence of atypical eating disorders decreased with the new classification system, the prevalence still remains high. For example, in a population of 215 young patients presenting for ED treatment, the diagnosis of EDNOS to OSFED decreased from 62.3% to 32.6%.Ornstein RM, Rosen DS, Mammel KA, Callahan ST, Forman S, Jay MS, Fisher M, Rome E, Walsh BT (2013). \\"Distribution of eating disorders in children and adolescents using the proposed DSM-5 criteria for feeding and eating disorders\\". Journal of Adolescent Health, 53(2), 303-5. In another study of 240 females in the U.S. with a lifetime history of an eating disorder, the prevalence changed from 67.9% EDNOS to 53.3% OSFED.Keel P.K., Brown T.A., Holm-Denoma J., Bodell L.P. (2011). \\"Comparison of DSM-IV versus proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for eating disorders: reduction of eating disorder not otherwise specified and validity\\". International Journal of Eating Disorders, 44(6), 553-60. Although the prevalence appears to reduce when using the categorizations of EDNOS vs. OSFED, a high proportion of cases still receive diagnoses of atypical eating disorders, which creates difficulties in communication, treatment planning, and basic research.Thomas, J. J., Vartanian, L. R., & Brownell, K. D. (2009). \\"The relationship between eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) and officially recognized eating disorders: Meta-analysis and implications for DSM\\". Psychological Bulletin, 135, 407-33. History In 1980, DSM-III was the first DSM to include a category for eating disorders that could not be classified in the categories of AN, BN, or pica.American Psychiatric Association (1980). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (3rd ed.) (DSM-III). Washington, DC: Author. This category was called Atypical Eating Disorder. Atypical Eating Disorder was described in one sentence in the DSM-III and received very little attention in the literature, as it was perceived to be uncommon compared to the other defined eating disorders. In DSM-III-R, published in 1987, the Atypical Eating Disorder category became known as Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS).American Psychiatric Association (1987). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (3rd ed., rev.) (DSM-III-R). Washington, DC: Author. DSM-III-R included examples of individuals who would meet criteria for EDNOS, in part to acknowledge the increasingly recognized heterogeneity of individuals within the diagnostic category. In 1994, DSM-IV was published and expanded EDNOS to include six clinical presentations. These presentations included individuals who: * met criteria for AN, but continued to menstruate, * met criteria for AN, but still had weight in the normal range despite significant weight loss, * met criteria for BN but did not meet frequency criterion for binge eating or purging, * engaged in inappropriate compensatory behavior after eating small amounts of food, or * repeatedly chewed or spit out food, or who binged on food but did not subsequently purge. A disadvantage of DSM-IV's broad EDNOS category was that people with very different symptoms were still classified as having the same diagnosis, making it difficult to access care specific to the disorder and conduct research on the diversity of pathology within EDNOS.Eddy K.T., Le Grange D., Crosby R.D., Hoste R.R., Doyle A.C., Smyth A., Herzog D.B. (2010). \\"Diagnostic classification of eating disorders in children and adolescents: how does DSM-IV-TR compare to empirically-derived categories?\\". Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 49(3), 277-87. Furthermore, EDNOS was perceived as less severe than AN or BN, despite findings that individuals diagnosed with EDNOS share similarities with full- threshold AN or BN in the degree of eating pathology, general psychopathology, and physical health.Thomas, Jennifer J. (2013, August 21). Goodbye EDNOS, Hello OSFED [Blog post]. Retrieved from http://www.jennischaefer.com/blog/eating-and-body-image/goodbye-ednos-hello- osfed-subthreshold-and-atypical-eating-disorders-in-dsm-5/ This perception prevented people in need from seeking help or insurance companies from covering treatment costs. DSM-5, published in 2013, sought to address these issues by adding new diagnoses and revising existing criteria.

Growth of liquid alternative strategies Launches of liquid alts funds tripled from 2009 to 2013.Liquid alts like go-go days of ETFs blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2013/12/06/goldman-on-liquid-alts-like-the-go- go-days-of-etfs/ Major drivers for the growth in liquid alternative funds include: *\\"The 2008 crisis has fundamentally changed investors‚Äô priorities from a main emphasis on investment returns and alpha generation to an emphasis on diversification and downside protection (or principal preservation), especially in the case of a steep market downdraft\\" *\\"investors have had the investment wind in their backs for decades with strong equity markets backed by strong economic growth and appreciating bond markets. They are now faced with extremely low interest rates and slow and uncertain economic growth. The result has been a rethinking of the traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio that has been the mainstay of investments\\" *\\"Complicating the issue is the changes in the investment management industry in terms of organization and scale of the companies, the host of new products, and the changes in the investment paradigm that has governed the industry for the past four decades. Individuals and institutions have been struggling to develop portfolio strategies to meet their changing needs. The role of alternative investments in investor portfolios has been an important part of this development\\". Retail liquid alternatives Retail investors interested in liquid alts are looking for growth but want more liquidity than hedge funds provide. In a Goldman Sachs report, the growth of liquid alternatives is \\"reminiscent of early-stage ETF growth\\". Consequences  \\"The rapid growth of Liquid Alternative Investments has had a profound effect on all aspects of the investment management industry, affecting investors, investment managers, and asset management companies around the world. It has blurred the distinction between formerly segregated parts of the industry‚Äînotably hedge funds and mutual funds‚Äîand led to competition between the various groups. It has provided investors‚Äîboth retail and institutional‚Äìwith a new tool for their portfolios, although many are not certain of its benefits. Investment advisors, meanwhile, have been hard at work learning about this new area and how to incorporate it into their asset management and advisory activities. Most recently, the growth of the industry has piqued the interest of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which has issued in early 2014 announced it would conduct a regulatory sweep of the largest of these alternative investments.

Its name was changed to the Omaha Theater in February 1935 when it was sold to new management. It closed on February 26, 1978 and was razed in 1980 to allow for the construction of a parking garage.  History  The 2,500 seat World Theater was designed by architect C. Howard Crane for the World Realty Company. Crane, a native of Detroit, was one of the foremost theatrical architects in the United States. Harry Lawrie, of the Omaha architectural firm of Mendelssohn, Fisher and Lawrie, oversaw the project from Omaha. The James Black Masonry and Construction Company served as the general contractors. Construction took ten months. The theater was constructed of brick on a steel frame. The exterior was faced in glazed terra cotta all around. Three grand arched windows with iron mullions separated by four sets of Corinthian columns dominated the front of the theater. Railings with balustrade sills completed the windows' ornamentation. The Corinthian columns supported an enriched frieze and cornice decorated with dentils and modillions. A parapet band with sculptured inserts and the inscribed words, World Theatre, was centered at the top of the building. The interior included a large chandelier with a thousand cut-glass crystals hanging from the large center dome of gold and silver inlay. Two smaller chandeliers hung from two lesser domes. In the lobby hung a chandelier of prismatic glass in the shape of a globe, surrounded by an orbit of comets, stars and crescents. Torchers of cathedral glass set on Corinthian shafts and marble bases are on the mezzanine foyer, and a ceiling of Chinese silk and Chinese coins decorated the women's lounge. The stage curtain was made of velvet with gold fringe and large tassels sewn by the Drapery Department of the J. L. Brandeis and Sons Store. The velvet carpets, also provided by the J. L. Brandeis Store, were in harmonizing shades of blue and gold. Completing the Brandeis decorations were davenports and overstuffed chairs in the promenade lounge and other smaller lounges. A $45,000 pipe organ manufactured by Hope-Jones Wurlitzer was installed by the theater's opening. The grand opening of the World Theater was on Saturday, April 15, 1922. A crowd of over 10,000 attended the opening with shows at 2:00 pm, 4:20 pm, 6:45 pm and 9:15 pm. Prices for the grand opening were 50 cents for unreserved seats, and 75 cents with a reservation. In February 1935 the World Theater was sold and the new management renamed it the Omaha Theater. It closed on February 26, 1978. When plans for redevelopment of the theater failed, the building was razed in 1980 and a parking garage built at the location.

The enterprise began as Flying Foods, a specialty food distributor, and transitioned into retail in 1992. History. Flying Foods was launched in 1981 by college roommates, Andy Arons and Walter Martin, and Paul Moriates, whom Martin met during a brief tenure working at Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Their mission was to import fresh foods that were not available in the United States at the time and sell them to chefs at high end restaurants in New York City, and elsewhere across the country. By 1987, when the business was sold to Kraft Foods, it had grown from one office to four and both imported foreign products and exported American artisan-made food overseas. Gourmet Garage began as a distributor in an actual garage space in Soho. When trucks from commercial clients left, they would open their doors to the general public. In 1992, the store formally opened on Wooster Street in Soho. Arons partnered with Adam Hartman, a CPA who had helped negotiate the sale of Flying Foods, and two food business veterans, John Gottfried and Edwin Visser, to open the retailer, which prided itself on the stark contrast to specialty stores of that period. Gottfried told the New York Daily Press, ‚ÄúThe previous approach was to sell this stuff like jewelry. We sell it like produce.‚Äù In 1994, the business moved to a larger space at the corner of Broome and Mercer in Soho. The following year they opened a new location in a former garage space on the East 64th St., still selling their high quality products at a slightly lower price. Gourmet Garage continued to pursue that audience throughout Manhattan, opening stores on the Upper East Side, in Greenwich Village, and near Lincoln Center. A new store in Tribeca just opened in mid September 2015.

Commissioner, 189 F.2d 107 (5th Cir. 1951), is a 1951 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the area of partnership taxation. It concerned a bid by a Texas Panhandle farmer to convert his farm into a family partnership by transferring some of its assets to his teenaged son. A three-judge panel unanimously affirmed the decision of the United States Tax Court that disallowed this. The Tax Court judge had not found that any of the actions taken to convert the farm into a partnership between father and son were the result of a genuine desire by the young man to be his father's partner. Although he had been doing a fair share of the farm's work, it seemed his father had taken all the steps to make him a partner, against the advice of his banker. The sole reason for the action was found to be a desire by the petitioner to reduce his individual tax liability. Joseph Chappell Hutcheson, Jr., then the circuit's chief judge, wrote for the panel in affirming the Tax Court's holding, although he also left intact some of the refunds it had granted. In a later case, the Tax Court found that a family partnership was formed for some subsequent tax years. While it has not been cited in many later tax cases, its unintentionally humorous title, suggesting a lawsuit between Batman and Commissioner Gordon from the DC Comics franchise, has earned it some notoriety in legal circles. Underlying dispute After spending his teen years working in wheat fields around the country, Ray Batman settled down on his own farm near Perryton, Texas, in 1923. His wife Edith bore a daughter and a son. By 1942 he had done well enough to purchase some of the land he had been renting. Three years later he farmed and ranched 200 head of cattle on over of land near Perryton and in nearby Harper County, Kansas.Batman v. Commissioner, hereafter Batman I, 9 TCM (CCH) 210, 211-12 (Tax Court, 1950) Batman was impressed by his son, Gerald, who worked hard on the farm on his school vacations and expressed interest in becoming a farmer himself. In either late 1943 or early 1944, he approached his accountant about making Gerald a partner in the farm, even though his son was only 14 at the time. The accountant tried to dissuade him from doing so, saying that the Treasury Department did not have a favorable view of such partnerships among family members, seeing them as a potential tax dodge. Over the next two years he distributed some of the farm's assets and profits to Gerald, per an oral agreement he claimed the two had made. He and his wife filed their tax returns reflecting this. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), however, did not consider the partnership between Ray and Gerald to have been legitimately formed and assessed both the Batmans almost $10,000 each in extra income tax for the years 1944 and 1945. Litigation The Batmans filed an appeal of the IRS's determination in United States Tax Court. It was not heard there until 1950. Judge Eugene Black issued a memorandum opinion in March upholding the IRS. While he agreed that some of the facts on the record supported Batman's assertions, he could not find that the partnership between father and son had been formed at the initiative of both parties. \\"The question of whether the partnership here in question is to be recognized for income tax purposes depends upon whether the parties, in good faith and acting with a business purpose, intended to join together as partners in the present conduct of the enterprise,\\" he wrote, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Commissioner v. Culbertson, which had involved a similar division of a family-owned ranch among sons.Commissioner v. Culbertson, \\"It seems to us,\\" he continued, Ray Batman claimed that his son was a silent partner, but Black could not find anything in the record which supported that. Since everything else suggested that the older man had continued to run the farm by himself as before, he agreed with the IRS that no partnership existed. He did, however, allow some of the deductions that the agency had denied Batman for those years.Batman I, 214‚Äì219 The Batmans appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. They claimed the Tax Court had given too much weight to their son's infancy, Ray Batman's status as head of the farm and Gerald's being the silent partner. A three-judge panel composed of Joseph Chappell Hutcheson, Jr., Wayne G. Borah and Robert Lee Russell took the case and rendered a decision over a year later, in 1951. Unanimously, they agreed with Black.Batman v. Commissioner, hereafter Batman II, 189 F.2d 107 (5th Cir., 1951) After briefly reviewing the parties' arguments, Hutcheson stated unequivocally that the court agreed with the IRS. \\"But for the partnership label affixed to it by the father, the inventor, creator, and deus ex machina of the plan for increasing his family's net earnings by decreasing the taxes accruing on them, no one would have any difficulty in seeing the arrangement for what it is, another attempt of the earner of the income to have his cake and eat it too, vicariously, indeed, for the present through his son.\\"Batman II, at 109. He likened it to the scheme before the Supreme Court two decades earlier in Lucas v. Earl, where the justices had disallowed a man's attempt to avoid taxes on half his income through a contract with his wife.Lucas v. Earl, Hutcheson went on to lament the difficulty courts had in seeing through the obfuscatory use of the term \\"partnership\\" in these cases: That August, the Batmans' petition to the Fifth circuit for a rehearing was denied. Later that year the Supreme Court denied their petition for certiorari, ending the case. Subsequent proceedings The Batmans challenged a later IRS finding, relying on the first case, that no partnership had existed in the years 1946 and 1947 either. Again the Batmans challenged it in court. The case went again to the Fifth Circuit, which in 1956 ruled in their favor.Campbell v. Batman, 239 F.2d 283 (5th Cir., 1956) Hutcheson, who again wrote for the panel, distinguished the two cases by one factor: Gerald's testimony. \\"Twenty-five years old on this trial and still an active partner with his father, eleven years after the beginning of their association, he was the chief witness,\\" the judge wrote. \\"His testimony, including cross-examination, occupied thirty-six pages of the record. Clear, direct, positive, and convincing, it fully supported the partnership claim for 1946 and 1947 ... Taking it over all, it presents a clear picture of a true farming partnership of father and son, entered into as a part of a plan, earlier evidenced in the gifts of land and cattle to the son for making his son a successful farmer.\\"Campbell, at 285 References External links * Category:1951 in United States case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit cases Category:United States Tax Court cases Category:United States taxation and revenue case law Category:Ochiltree County, Texas ","title":"Batman v.

Etymology and history During the colonial era, the word affranchi (meaning \\"manumitted\\") referred to free people of color, many of whom were of mixed French-African parentage. After the Haitian Revolution, when all slaves were freed, the term instead came to be used to describe the emerging light-skinned elite (the \\"Mulatto ascendancy\\"). Europeans in Saint- Domingue delighted in the affranchi entertainment. Both Europeans and Affranchis performed the varied line and square configurations and often made slaves dance to entertain colonial guests. Affranchi practices spread throughout Haiti and was accompanied by African-descended Kings and Queens. This highly regarded performance style and regal association was also taken to Cuba, Puerto Rico, the United States and to the rest of the disapora in the late eighteenth century. Description The dance involved a series of straight-backed, held-torso, French style figures and then African-styled improvisation on the final set much like the tumba francesa that later emerged in Cuba by Haitian refugees escaping the Haitian Revolution, but was performed to the string and woodwind instruments, instead of the drums.

Kahn (1916‚Äì1973) was an American attorney and real estate developer who played a major role in the expansion of the City of San Diego in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He received frequent press coverage for his ongoing role in developing Clairemont, University City and Rancho Pe√±asquitos. He is also notable for having built one of the first skyscrapers in downtown San Diego. Early life Born in 1916, Kahn was the son of Abraham J. Kahn, a Russian Jewish immigrant who settled in San Diego in 1922. Abraham operated a bootlegging business during prohibition, which he transitioned into a successful liquor import business after the end of prohibition. Irvin had two younger brothers ‚Äì Julius and Yale. Career Observing his father's frequent run-ins with the courts due to his bootlegging past, Irvin was inspired to pursue a career as a criminal defense attorney. Irvin Kahn began his professional career as a defense attorney representing a number of high- profile clients, including several local labor unions. He also worked as a lobbyist on city affairs, representing the Veterans Cab Company in their bid to increase the number of taxi permits issued by the City of San Diego. In the late 1940s, Kahn became one of the owners of the San Diego Padres, then a minor-league team in the Pacific Coast League. (The sale was delayed by several years due to concerns over his father's bookmaking activities and brother Yale's professional gambling.) Though he had been opportunistically acquiring land throughout the 1940s, Kahn's first major real estate development project was a 312 unit apartment complex in Point Loma, started in 1951 as part of a 9,000 unit military housing initiative in San Diego. =Development Projects= Beginning in the mid-1950s, Irvin Kahn began to receive frequent press coverage due to his high-profile development activities. Between 1952 and his death in 1973, Kahn initiated a series of large and small development projects that by some estimates involved 25% of all developable land in the City of San Diego. Kahn's first major project was the Clairemont Subdivision. The project was initiated by Carlos Tavares and Lou Burgener in 1950, but Kahn took a leadership role in the venture in 1955. He was responsible for the development of the Clairemont Shopping Center as well as hundreds of new housing units built in the late 1950s. He also launched development projects in Chula Vista and La Mesa during that time. In the early 1960s, as the Clairemont subdivision was reaching completion, Kahn turned his attention to nearby University City. He partnered with Carlos Tavares and brought in developer Louis Lesser as a minority partner to develop the approximately 4,400 acres. In 1962, Kahn acquired the approximately 14,000 acre Rancho Pe√±asquitos with financing from Sixty Trust, the employee pension fund of airplane manufacturer Textron, Inc. (Rancho Pe√±asquitos was one of only a handful of large ranches still operating within the city limits.) Kahn planned to develop the land into a massive $1 billion housing development with a golf course, apartments, single-family tract homes, retirement housing, and shopping centers. Kahn's broad vision set in motion a series of additional planning processes that created lengthy delays for the project, with the San Diego City Planning Commission voting to delay consideration of Kahn's subdivision plan for several years until a master plan could be developed for the area. By 1965 the project was in danger of foreclosure and required additional financing. Kahn recruited Louis Lessor's help in obtaining financing from the Teamsters Pension Fund through Lessor's relationship with Morris Shenker, who was the gatekeeper for the Pension Fund's investments. Shenker arrange a $10M mortgage from the Mercantile Trust Company National Association and an additional $3.5M in financing from the Teamsters Pension Fund. In exchange, the Teamsters Pension Fund received a first deed of trust on Rancho Pe√±asquitos, and a 20% share in the Rancho Pe√±asquitos development corporation. By the early 1970s, additional capital was needed to finance the large-scale development that was expected to take place in the 1970s ‚Äì Kahn's plan involved creating homes for more than 150,000 people. Though Kahn was able to refinance the project, his sudden death in 1973 put those plans in jeopardy. The vision for Rancho Pe√±asquitos shifted significantly after Kahn's death, with larger single-family homes taking the place of the apartment complexes and small-lot tract housing that Kahn had envisioned. Today Rancho Pe√±asquitos is home to roughly 55,000 residents, little more than a third of the size of the community originally envisioned. =Bowling Alleys & Other Projects= In addition to Clairemont, University City, and Rancho Pe√±asquitos, Kahn was involved in a number of notable projects in the history of the City of San Diego. In the late 1950s, he participated in smaller development projects in Chula Vista and La Mesa and was a vocal advocate for the \\"Shattuck Plan\\" to convert Horton Plaza to a convention hall. In 1960 he was part of a group of developers who pooled together a $4M loan for low income housing in Mexico. Also in the early 1960s, Kahn erected two 'skyscrapers' in Centre City. At the time they were two of the tallest buildings in San Diego, surpassed only by the El Cortez hotel (1927) and the Executive Complex (1963). Kahn built a bowling alley and nightclub in El Cajon with Louis Lesser, and eventually expanded his bowling holdings to include 11 alleys. He also developed two resort hotel properties on Shelter Island, the first of their kind on the small strip of reclaimed land adjacent to the canneries of Point Loma, and was Chairman & CEO of the Continental Connector Corporation, which held a controlling interest in the iconic Dunes Hotel, Casino & Country Club. In addition to San Diego, Kahn participated in real estate development activities in San Francisco, Arizona & Nevada. Teamsters Pension Fund Controversy Beginning in the mid-1960s, Kahn financed his increasingly ambitious development projects with loans from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, which brought him under scrutiny from the FBI and IRS. Newspapers after his death reported that an IRS trailer had been semi- permanently parked outside his company headquarters, reviewing the accounting books from Kahn's numerous businesses. (Despite the thorough review, the IRS effort turned up little incriminating information aside from Kahn's tendency to wait until the last minute to pay bills.) Similarly, the FBI monitored Kahn's activities for several years and raided a \\"high-stakes gambling ring\\" at his Murrieta Hot Springs resort. (The raid 'nabbed' dozens of elderly female spa guests who had been playing mah-jong and bridge, an outcome that was covered humorously in the contemporary press.) Personal life and death Kahn was married to Eleanor Barlin (1925 - 2011); they had one son, Samuel ‚ÄúSandy‚Äù Kahn.Carmel Valley News: \\"Eleanor B. Kahn 1925 - 2011\\" April 7, 2011 Kahn died suddenly in September 1973 from a heart attack while watching the Ali-Norton fight on closed circuit television. At the time of his death, he owed nearly $180 million to the Teamsters Pension Fund (nearly $1 billion in 2015 dollars), making the Irvin Kahn Organization & subsidiaries the fund's largest investment. Kahn's 19-year-old son Samuel, then a college Freshman, took over the companies and the settlement of the estate, divesting the Kahn family companies from their association with the Teamsters and refocusing on less risky real estate development activities.

Lemon (January 19, 1947 - May 29, 2020) was an American meteorologist bridging research and forecasting with expertise in weather radar, particular regarding severe convective storms. Lemon is, along with Charles A. Doswell III, a seminal contributor to the modern conception of the supercell which was first identified by Keith Browning, and he developed the Lemon technique to estimate updraft strength and thunderstorm organization (in highly sheared environments) also as a continuation of Browning's work.  Early life  Lemon's interest in severe storms was triggered in earnest after he witnessed the F5 Ruskin Heights tornado on May 20, 1957 which caused light damage to his family's home and severe damage very nearby. Lemon studied meteorology at the University of Kansas (KU) and the University of Oklahoma (OU), graduating with a B.S. from the University of Oklahoma in 1970. Career Lemon embarked on graduate school studies but being the Vietnam era he wasn't able to continue and he joined the NOAA Commissioned Corps. Afterward, in addition to developing the Lemon technique at the Techniques Development Unit (TDU) of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) and his work on the supercell thunderstorm, Lemon was a major developer of the WSR-88D or \\"NEXRAD\\". In 1976 NOAA bestowed a Special Achievement Award for his co-discovery of tornado vortex signature (TVS). He has since taught widely on the subjects of radar and severe convective storms throughout the United States and internationally. At Lockheed Martin, Lemon was a key developer of its microburst prediction radar. Lemon also worked at Unisys and other companies during his career and currently operates a forensic and consulting meteorology company. Lemon was president of the National Weather Association (NWA) in 2001 and served on a National Academy of Sciences National Research Council (NAS NRC) committee on \\"Weather Radar Technology Beyond NEXRAD\\" that same year.

In 1989, he began 15 seasons as an assistant coach at the University of North Dakota (UND), where he was part of eight NCAA playoff teams and six North Central Conference (NCC) title squads. In 1997, Schweigert was appointed to defensive coordinator, and in 2000, Schweigert was named the American Football Coaches Association Division II Assistant Coach of the Year. His 2001 defense, led by team captain Travis O'Neel, gave up only 191.4 yards of total offense per game limiting teams to an average of just 50.3 rushing yards and 12.5 points per game on the way to the program‚Äôs first national championship. In 2002, Schweigert was honored with Jamestown's Rollie Greeno Award for outstanding commitment in the field of education and coaching, along with the team finishing second nationally in 2003. Leaving UND after the 2003 season, Schweigert took his first college head coaching job at the University of Minnesota Duluth. The coached the school's NCAA Division II football program from 2004 to 2007. He guided the Bulldogs to a 22‚Äì21 overall record during this time, along with the team's first NCC title in 2005. The NCAA playoff berth that season was the program's second in four seasons. Schweigert was also named both the D2football.com Northwest Region Coach of the Year and the AFCA Division II Coach of the Year for Region 5 in 2005, as well. Coaching career at SIU Throughout his coaching history at Southern Illinois University, Schweigert‚Äôs coaching style has led the Salukis to defensive success, being ranked near the top of many aspects of defensive play. In 2013, he coached the Salukis defense to an average of 5.9 tackles for loss per game, ranking third in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), a defense ranking second in the MVC and tied for 18th in the nation in rush defense that held opponents to an average of 122.8 rushing yards per game, holding six of 12 opponents to fewer than 100 yards rushing and other teams to 50 rushing yards or fewer at least four times. In 2012, Schweigert's Saluki defense ranked third in the MVC with 15 fumbles, tied for 10th most in the nation. Schweigert's 2011 defense ranked third in the Missouri Valley Football Conference in total yardage, interceptions and sacks, as well as led the conference in total defense in 2010, giving up an average of 332.1 yards per game with the absence of four secondary-defensive starters. His 2009 defense ranked second nationally with 23 interceptions, and tied for fourth nationwide with 33 forced turnovers. In the same year, his group also ranked eighth nationally in scoring defense, allowing 15.92 points per game and led the MVC with 36 sacks. In 2008, Schweigert‚Äôs defense was tied for 12th nationally in forced turnovers (29) and in five seasons his teams had forced an average of 2.2 turnovers per game (a total of 127). Coaching philosophy Defensively, Schweigert follows a very aggressive style of football. He features a blitzing 3-4 scheme that emphasizes putting pressure on the offense and forcing short gains and high amounts of turnovers, believing these to be the pinnacles of a successful football team. A hallmark of Schweigert's defenses is to stop the run and attack the quarterback. He famously noted in the press conference announcing his hiring as head coach at North Dakota that, \\"We want the opposing quarterback and the quarterback's mother to be the two most uncomfortable people in the building\\". Conversely, Schwiegert's North Dakota teams have been extremely conservative on the offensive side of the ball. They focus on establishing the run and controlling the time of possession, which hopes to limit the number of possessions for opposing offenses. It also allows his aggressive defense to stay rested. This style is a sharp contrast to the offense that was run in his earlier head coaching days at Minnesota Duluth. During his tenure there, the Bulldogs featured a high flying aerial attack capable of scoring points in bunches.

Early life and family Born in South Witham near Grantham, Lincolnshire, Lyonel was the eldest son of the Reverend Ralph Tollemache and his first wife and cousin, Caroline Tollemache. Ralph was noted for the increasingly eccentric names given to his numerous offspring. Lyonel graduated from Jesus College, Cambridge.

Sir Humphrey Thomas Tollemache, 6th Baronet (10 August 1897 ‚Äì 1990) Baronetage On the death of his second cousin, William Tollemache, 9th Earl of Dysart, 3rd Baronet, Lyonel succeeded to the Baronetage in 1935 at the age of 81. He inherited Dysart's holding in Buckminster estate and the entirety of Ham House with the surrounding land and property in Petersham, Ham and Canbury and the gravel works at Ham. Lyonel and his middle-aged bachelor son, Cecil, moved into Ham House. The Dysart title and other estates were passed to Dysart's niece, Wenefryde Scott. World War II The father and son duo increasingly struggled to maintain Ham House, especially as the outbreak of war reduced the availability of labour. The nearby Leyland military vehicle and munitions factory was a local target and bombs fell near the house. Tollemache moved most of the valuable furniture and art works from the house to the country for safe keeping. The family deeds and papers, some dating back to the 14th- century, were placed in deep vaults in Chancery Lane. Although they survived the Blitz, they were damaged by flooding from fire-hoses and were thought to have been destroyed. Many were recovered from the Ham House Stables in 1953 and transferred to The National Archives.

Lyonel and his son moved to Langham House on Ham Common, one of the many Tollemache properties in the area. In 1949, Buckminster Estates Ltd, the Tollemache's company established in 1936, sold the remaining Tollemache interests in the area by auction in 124 lots comprising land, 41 residences, 99 cottages, a farm, 4 shops, 2 licensed premises, freehold ground rents and building plots and the sand and gravel works.

Commonly known as Flacco, this liceo classico welcomes students from 14 to 19 years of age. The scholastic environments (classrooms and offices) are still located in the original building, which was built along a stretch of Bari‚Äôs Lungomare in 1933. Education A liceo classico is the oldest type of secondary school in Italy. The educational curriculum lasts for five years and it is particularly focused on the study of humanities. Today, the Flacco is commonly considered a highly formative school, also due to its singular characteristic of a broad teaching of ancient languages and traditional subjects as history and philosophy. In fact, the study of Latin and ancient Greek, along with their literature, is peculiar of this kind of institution.Scotto di Luzio, Adolfo. Il Liceo Classico. Bologna: Il Mulino, 1999. Print. However, in the past thirty years the Flacco has witnessed multiple changes in its didactics. Progressively, mathematics, informatics and sciences became an important part of the curriculum. Then, the study of the English language became mandatory for all the five years and a program specifically destined to history of art and archaeology became part of the school‚Äôs offerings. Audio and video materials were also integrated in the learning experience.Carofiglio, Gianrico. Il Bordo Vertiginoso delle Cose. Rome: Rizzoli, 2013. Print. The course of studies is divided in two years of ginnasio (4th ginnasio and 5th ginnasio, which are technically a continuation of middle school) and three years of liceo (1st, 2nd and 3rd liceo). This denomination of the classes is different from any other type of school in Italy and it comes directly from the Gentile Reform, approved during the fascist regime. At the end of the five years, students must complete and pass the esame di maturit√† (Italian for ‚Äúexam of maturity‚Äù) to obtain their certificate and go on to university.Scotto di Luzio, Adolfo. Il Liceo Classico. Bologna: Il Mulino, 1999. Print. Quintus Horatius Flaccus The Flacco is dedicated to the Latin author Quintus Horatius Flaccus, native of the Apulian city of Venosa. Usually known in the English-speaking world as Horace, he was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus. His works were composed in elegant and serious hexameter verses and caustic iambic poetry.La Penna, Antonio. Saggi e Studi su Orazio. Firenze: Sansoni, 1993. Print. According to Quintilian, he was at times lofty, yet also full of charm and grace, and daring in his choice of words. He was politically active as a spokesman of Augustus‚Äôs regime. This was arguably the reason of his relative independence in his literary work, even though some think that all his arguments were in favor of the emperor and he was less more than a court slave.Rostagni, Augusto. Orazio. Potenza: Osanna Venosa, 1991. Print. History =Origins= The Flacco finds its origins in the Regio Liceo delle Puglie, a scholastic institution founded in 1774 at the time of the Bourbon domination in Bari. In 1865, however, after the reunification of Italy into a kingdom and after the approval of a law that secularized education, the school changed name into Regio Liceo-Convitto ‚ÄúDomenico Cirillo‚Äù, a physician and a patriot during the revolution happened in Naples in 1799.‚ÄúStoria.‚Äù Orazio Flacco: Liceo Classico Statale: Bari. No publisher. No date. Web. 5 Mar. 2014. From 1885 until 1933 the liceo was located on the first floor of the building which hosts today the Ateneo (the University of Bari), with the exception of the years of World War I, when the building was used as hospital and the school moved to the Provincial Deputation in Via Melo da Bari.‚ÄúStoria.‚Äù Orazio Flacco: Liceo Classico Statale: Bari. No publisher. No date. Web. 5 Mar. 2014. =Fascist Era and World War II= In 1933 the building that hosts today the liceo was built according to the project of architect Concezio Petrucci. A particular characteristic of this building is that it is shaped as an M, which was a direct reference to Benito Mussolini, dictator of fascist Italy. In fact, he financed the construction of brand new buildings on the Lungomare (Italian for ‚Äúwater front‚Äù) of Bari, including the Flacco, which has its monumental main entrance on Corso Vittorio Veneto, a street that runs along the coastline.Colonna, Angela. I Lungomari del Ventennio. Bari: Laterza, 2001. Print. The first floor was occupied by the offices of secretariat, the presidency, the aula magna decorated with valuable bas-reliefs by sculptors Francesco Nagni and Amedeo Vecchi, the teacher‚Äôs library, the departments of physics, chemistry and natural sciences and a little amphitheater. The second floor instead hosted the classrooms and the students‚Äô library. This composition is conserved nowadays, but a third floor was built during the 60s, along with a new wing which hides a little bit the original attempt of giving the building the shape of an M.Colonna, Angela. I Lungomari del Ventennio. Bari: Laterza, 2001. Print. In 1935, after the reunion of the school‚Äôs board of directors, the name of the institution was changed from Domenico Cirillo to Quinto Orazio Flacco, the most famous Latin poet of Apulia. From 1943 until 1945, the original building was occupied by the Allied troops because of its strategic position with a view over the sea, and the school population was obligated to gather in spaces luckily found and available to the usage as meeting point for over 1200 students.‚ÄúStoria.‚Äù Orazio Flacco: Liceo Classico Statale: Bari. No publisher. No date. Web. 5 Mar. 2014. =Modern Days= From the 1970s until present day, the liceo has experienced many variations from its traditional nature of humanistic high school in order to keep up with the national directives that gave more importance to sciences and foreign languages, particularly English. Today‚Äôs school‚Äôs motto is ‚Äúinnovation and tradition‚Äù, precisely because the liceo is interested in both educating students to be citizens of the modern, globalized, English-speaking, technology-oriented world, and maintaining the focus on those classical values that history, philosophy and ancient literature can teach.‚ÄúStoria.‚Äù Orazio Flacco: Liceo Classico Statale: Bari. No publisher. No date. Web. 5 Mar. 2014. Notable alumni In Bari, the Flacco carries the reputation of the school that shapes the minds of tomorrow‚Äôs leaders. And if a look at the ruling class of the city is taken (consisting of successful entrepreneurs, freelancers like lawyers and doctors, and politicians), this statement is actually found to be true. Many of these individuals come from a Flacco secondary education. One of the Flacco‚Äôs most famous alumni is Michele Emiliano, president of Apulia and former mayor of Bari, important member of the Italian Democratic Party, and nationally known judge. Another is Luciano Canfora, classical philologist, historian and essayist with a particular interest in law and in the preservation of the Italian constitution. His parents were both teachers at the Flacco for a long time. Today the teacher‚Äôs hall of the liceo is named after his father Fabrizio Canfora, historian of philosophy. Luciano Canfora‚Äôs books have an international audience and they are translated in more than ten languages. Finally, there is Gianrico Carofiglio, former anti-mafia judge and successful novelist. In his books N√© qui n√© altrove. Una notte a Bari (Italian for ‚ÄúNeither here nor anywhere else. A night in Bari‚Äù) and Il bordo vertiginoso delle cose (Italian for ‚ÄúThe dizzy edge of things‚Äù) he mentions the Flacco as a city landmark of Bari. The second of these novels has actually the liceo as its setting.Carofiglio, Gianrico. N√© Qui N√© Altrove. Una Notte a Bari. Bari: Laterza, 2008. Print.Carofiglio, Gianrico.

The project is detailed on its website, Build the Enterprise, and is spearheaded by an engineer who goes by the name BTE Dan. He cites himself as a systems engineer and electrical engineer who has worked at a Fortune 500 company for the past 30 years. The ship would be able to carry the personnel, supplies and equipment needed for a long journey or colonization of another planet. History The website was launched in May 2012. It gained widespread recognition after the story was covered by the major news corporations NBCNews, and Huffington Post. On December 22, 2012, BTE Dan created a petition on the White House's We the People website. The petition stated that NASA should do a feasibility study of the project. A petition on the website requires 25,000 signatures in 30 days to merit the attention of the White House1. However, the petition only received 7,200 signatures. Propulsion According to the original proposal, still found on the site's home page, the Gen1 Enterprise will have 3 main engines. They will be ion thrusters that give constant acceleration. This acceleration will be slow, but over time it will allow the ship to travel at great speeds. The engines will be nuclear powered. The nuclear power system will also be used to power the ship's lighting, controls, and all other equipment on board. In addition to the main engines, there will be impulse engines for short bursts of thrust. They will be used to help the ship exit from orbit around a planet or moon quickly. They will also be used when emergency short bursts of power are needed to avoid obstacles. Unlike the main engines, the impulse engines must be much more powerful. Therefore, they will be powered by liquid propellant made of liquid Hydrogen and liquid Oxygen. Subsequent ongoing activity in the site's forums pages have since offered numerous alternatives to this original proposal. Among these, rather than one of the variants of traditional ion engines, the use of VASIMR engines is currently being strongly considered, although this would still be powered by the 2.5 GigaWatt (output) nuclear power plants. Other possible alternatives for the main propulsion and power sources are being considered as new technologies are steadily coming into existence and being tested. Likewise, plans for the \\"impulse\\" engines are being modified, as conventional thrusters are considered too weak to be of any practical use. One option proposed would be to tap the nuclear generators directly as nuclearthermal rockets similar to the NERVA concept. Chemical rockets might still be useful as part of a reaction control thruster system, for very fine maneuvers. Warp drive In Houston, Texas, at the Johnson Space Center, Harold White is working to create a warp drive that could be used for propulsion. Although this project is not related to the project proposed by BTE Dan, it could still possibly be used in a future version of the Enterprise. The project is based on Miguel Alcubierre's spacetime metric. The warp drive would allow the ship to travel faster than the speed of light by compressing space around it to create a moving bubble. As of yet however, there still remain many problems with the theory. Funding The Gen1 Enterprise is slated to cost $706 billion USD. This doesn't include costs to launch the needed parts into space, however. The total cost for the project is estimated at US$983 billion. It is proposed that NASA will create a program to build the spacecraft. The ship will take about 20 years to build, and Congress will allocate 0.27% of the United States' Gross Domestic Product each year to the program. Comparison to the Television Show Note: For more information on the original starship, see Starship Enterprise The spaceship that is proposed to be built is named the Gen1 Enterprise. Unlike the original Enterprise, the hangar deck will be at the underside of the saucer hull instead of the lower hull section. This is because the lower hull will be reserved for the main engine and main nuclear reactor. In addition, the bridge will be moved lower so that it is within range of the gravity wheel.

The band broke up in 1991 but reunited for a concert in 1999 and got back together again in 2007. To date, Blood Feast has released three studio albums, four compilation albums, two EPs and one demo cassette. History =Initial career (1985‚Äì1991)= The band was formed in 1985 by drummer Kevin Kuzma, bassist Louis Starita, vocalist Gary Markovitch, and guitarist Adam Tranquilli under the name Bloodlust. In February 1986, the band recorded their first demo, The Suicidal Missions. In the same month, Michael Basden joined as second guitarist. Shortly after, the band changed its name to Blood Feast. In June 1986, the band signed to a contract. The recordings for the first album were financed by the band itself. In February 1987, the band released their debut album Kill for Pleasure, and followed the release with some live performances, finishing each concert with a cover version of \\"Into Crypts of Rays\\" by Celtic Frost. In December 1987, the band recorded an EP (Face Fate). In June 1988 the band recorded a ten-song demo. Guitarist Adam Tranquili was no longer active by this time. Although initially titled The Last Remains, it was released as an album in 1989 under the name Chopping Block Blues. The band broke up in 1991. =Reunions (1999‚Äì2013)= In 1999, the band reformed for a single appearance at the March Metal Meltdown in Asbury Park, New Jersey. In 2002, Kevin Kuzma founded his own label, Militia Records, and released the compilation, Remnants: The Last Remains. On this were demo and live recordings, as well as certain unreleased songs. In 2007, the band rejoined. This line-up featured founding members Kevin Kuzma and Adam Tranquili, along with guitarist John Blicharz, bassist Karl Odenwalder, and singer Tony Stanziano; all of whom were from Kevin Kuzma's death metal band, Annunaki. Current bass player, Tom Lorenzo (who replaced Odenwalder), and vocalist, Chris Natalini (who replaced Stanziano) were added in 2010, just a few months ahead of the band's performance at the Headbangers Open Air Festival in Germany. Blood Feast returned for a 2nd appearance at H.O.A. in 2013. This incarnation of the band remained intact until March 2014, at which point Kuzma and Blicharz were replaced by Joe Moore (formerly of DTA and Nemesis) and CJ Scioscia (of Insaniac and Skullshifter), respectively. =The Future State of Wicked (2014‚Äìpresent)= A pre-production demo of the first new Blood Feast song in nearly 25 years, entitled \\"Off With Their Heads\\", was made available for streaming via YouTube in August 2014. The new line-up then had its debut performance at Empire in West Springfield, VA on 13 September 2014, and has been active ever since. Two performances at the True Thrash Fest in Osaka, Japan occurred on 21‚Äì22 February 2015. On September 25, 2015, Blood Feast announced that they had signed with Hells Headbangers Records, and by the next year, they had been recording their first studio album since 1989 at LCBW Recording in Watchung, New Jersey. The album, titled, The Future State of Wicked, was released on 14 April 2017.

Early years Alexandre Pierre Freslon was born in La Fl√®che, Sarthe, on 11 May 1808 to a family of farmers. He studied law at the Faculty of Paris and entered the Bar in Angers in 1829. He held Liberal views, and on 17 July 1830 was prosecuted for participating in a demonstration against the government. He defended himself and was acquitted. After the July Revolution Freslon entered the judiciary as a crown prosecutor. However, he did not approve of the new government and in 1832 resigned and resumed has career as a lawyer. In 1839 he founded the Pr√©curseur de l'Ouest, a Republican newspaper. He became a member of the council of Angers. He fought the mayor of Angers, denouncing him in his paper for corruption in 1846 and earning a fine of 100 francs. Second Republic On 2 March 1848 the Provisional Government appointed Freslon Attorney General of the Angers Court of Appeals. On 23 April 1848 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly as representative for Maine-et-Loire. He was a member of the legislative committee. He aligned himself with the moderate Republicans and General Louis- Eug√®ne Cavaignac. On 13 October 1848 Cavaignac appointed Freslon Minister for Public Education and Religious Affairs.

United States, 487 U.S. 533 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court decision that created the modern \\"independent source doctrine\\" exception to the exclusionary rule. The exclusionary rule makes most evidence gathered through violations of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution inadmissible in criminal trials as \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\". In Murray, the Court ruled that when officers conduct two searches, the first unlawful and the second lawful, evidence seized during the second search is admissible if the second search \\"is genuinely independent of [the] earlier one.\\".  Background  The case arose out of the conviction of Michael F. Murray for conspiracy to possess and distribute illegal drugs. Based on information received from informants, federal law enforcement agents had been surveilling Murray. They observed Murray drive a truck into a warehouse. The agents saw the truck leave with another driver, and lawfully seized it. The agents found marijuana in the vehicle. After making this discovery, several agents illegally entered the warehouse. They found burlap bales in the warehouse. They did not reenter the warehouse until they received a warrant. In applying for the warrant, the agents did not mention their prior illegal entry.Murray, 487 U.S. at 535.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court in a 4-3 decision. The majority opinion agreed with the government that \\"the independent source doctrine applies to evidence initially discovered during, or as a consequence of, an unlawful search but later obtained independently from activities untainted by the initial illegality.\\"Murray, 487 U.S. at 537. The Court found that a search pursuant to a warrant is not genuinely independent of evidence if (1) the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial [illegal] entry or (2) if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1845 using designs by the architect Eiler Hagerup Holtermann who based his designs on plans drawn by Hans Linstow. The church seats about 370 people. History There has been a church on this site for many centuries. The first church was probably a stave church from the middle ages. It is not known when the first church was built, but the baptismal font in the church is dated to the 1100s. The old church was eventually torn down (probably during the 1600s) and it was replaced with a timber-framed church. This new church had a nave and a choir.

This occurs in the phase of early development when a child is completely dependent, and both physically and emotionally closely bonded with their mother. Emotional symbiosis is a very common occurrence as it originates from the early childhood treatment of babies. People who have emotional symbiosis tend to put others down in order to make themselves feel as if they have all of the right answers. Emotional symbiosis is usually handed down through generations and can have a negative impact on one's family life.  Average psychological stages of life  = Infant ‚Äì Basic Trust vs. Mistrust = In Erik Erikson's psychosocial theory, he believes that once babies are born, the first phase that they have to go through is figuring out whether the people that they are around are trustworthy or untrustworthy. Babies begin to trust the people that are around them by giving them their basic needs ‚Äì care, food, and attention. Once infants have a bond with a person that has fulfilled their needs, they begin to put their trust into that individual. = Toddler ‚Äì Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt = Once infants begin to form into toddlers, they begin to test out their freedoms and the extent that they should go with their freedoms. For example, a baby may want to play with the scissors on the ground, but once a parent snatches those scissors away from them, they begin to realize what they are expected to touch and not to touch. Also, they feel shameful because they notice the unhappy expressions that are on their parent's faces. = Preschool/Early Childhood ‚Äì Initiative and Guilt = As children began to grow into their early childhood phase, they begin to take charge of their actions and see how far they can go until someone stops these actions. A child may shred paper on the ground and laugh, but once they get caught, they will feel guilty because they know that they were not supposed to do that certain action. Again, in this phase, children try to find out the extent that they can go until someone stops them. = School Age/Play ‚Äì Industry vs. Inferiority = As a child begins to grow, they fully realize that they are children are expected to act in a certain type of manner. A question that children may ask themselves in this phase is, \\"Can I make it in the world of people and things?\\". Children typically began to realize how small they are in the world during this phase, and how much they are able to achieve on their own. = Adolescence ‚Äì Identity vs. Role Confusion = In this phase, peer influence really begins to take control of an adolescent's mind. Children began to wonder, \\"where do I truly belong?\\", and the way that most children find out who they really are is through peer influences, which can be positive influences or negative. = Young Adulthood ‚Äì Intimacy vs. Isolation = When an individual is transforming into a young adult, a common question in their mind is, essentially, \\"can I love?\\". In this phase, an individual begins to wonder if there is someone for them in the world, if they will ever find love, or if love just isn't for them. Also, they wonder if it's better to be in a relationship, single, or just completely be alone. = Adulthood ‚Äì Generativity vs. Stagnation = In this stage, an individual wonders whether or not they want to contribute to the society. In Generativity, the individual would want to set an example for the generations to come, and leave their mark on society. On the other hand, a person who chooses Stagnation would care less for the society and the generations who are coming. People who are in favor of Stagnation are usually self-absorbed and would rather focus on their own well being. = Old Age ‚Äì Ego Integrity vs. Despair = In this final stage of life, people began to figure out whether they are mentally prepared to move onto the next stage of life, whatever they choose to believe in. The other alternative is to stay as strong as they possibly can to remain on Earth and make these last moments of life count. When an individual is in Despair, they focus on death more than the last moments that they have on Earth. On the other hand, a person who chooses to have ego integrity chooses to make the best of their life, and they have more confidence for what's ahead of them in the future. = Separation- individuation theory of child development = This theory, created by Margaret Mahler, explains how infants begin to get self-absorbed in 3 phases. These phases are the normal autistic phase, normal symbiotic phase, and the separation-individuation phase.  Normal autistic phase  This phase shows that infants are usually self-absorbed, because they spend most of them time sleeping and crying, and spending less time actually trying to figure out the world that they are living in and the people they are around.  Normal symbiotic phase  In the normal symbiotic phase, infants grow a very close connection with themselves and their mother. This relationship is very essential to them, and they focus on this relationship more than they focus on the outside world. During this phase, the infant realizes that it is living in order to please its mother.  Separation-individuation phase  This is the phase where an infant begins to separate from its mother in order to find out its purpose in the world. This phase is divided into 3 subcategories that go further in depth into how infants begin to grow into an individual. = Hatching (first months) = In this phase, infants begin to have a certain alertness about the outside world, and they're wanting to look at the world in a more enthusiastic way. = Practicing (9‚Äì16 months) = In this phase, usually, infants begin to crawl and look for ways to explore their surroundings. = Rapprochement (15‚Äì24 months) = In this phase, the infant wants to further explore the world, but wants to have the mother's attention throughout their exploration. If the mother doesn't pay attention to the child's enthusiasm to observe their surroundings, the infant may feel abandoned or anxious. References * Human Development. Joy Brewster, n.d.

Her parents were both Polish-born and British-educated; her father was a civil engineer, and her mother was a nurse. Sandra graduated from Hillel Academy in 1975, as valedictorian and a National Merit Scholar. Welner enrolled in an accelerated medical education program, where she completed undergraduate work at Lehigh University, and earned her medical degree from the Medical College of Pennsylvania, in 1981 (at age 22).

Career  Welner began her career as a surgeon and an infertility specialist, directing a women's clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1987, she experienced a cardiac arrest while at a hospital in the Netherlands. Complications afterwards led to neurological impairments, particularly affecting mobility, vision, and fine-motor skills. After bleak initial prognosis and five years of rehabilitation, she was eventually able to resume a career in medicine, if not as a surgeon. (She continued to use a cane and other supports.)Adam Davidson, \\"Court Says Dollar Design Discriminates Against Blind,\\" All Things Considered (National Public Radio)(May 20, 2008). Welner's practice after her injury focused on primary care for disabled women.

It tells the story of a young girl whose foster mother has a premonition that her unstable biological mother is coming to claim her and take her away. The premonition comes true and thus the film unfolds. Plot The film focuses on a young girl who is terrified that her insane mother will take her away from her beloved foster mother. One day, the crazed real mother attempts to contact the girl at school, but her foster mother has a premonition and gets there in time to protect the girl. Eventually though, the real mother and her boy friend, a carnival clown, succeed and takes her away, leaving the bereaved foster parents to enlist the assistance of a parapsychologist to help them interpret the foster mother's terrifying dreams and psychic connection to the girl and find her before it is too late.

Complete articulated specimens show that the armored section of the body had an average length of 2-4 cm. Species of Microbrachius are characterized by having large heads with short thoracic armor. Specimens of Microbrachius have been found in Scotland, Belarus, Estonia, and China. Specimens range in age from the Lower Devonian Late Emsian Stage (393.3 Ma) to the Middle Devonian Upper Givetian Stage (382.7 Ma). Although two of the four described species are known from Late Emsian-aged strata of Early Devonian China, the type and youngest species, M. dicki, is known from upper Givetian freshwater strata of Scotland. The various species have short thoracic armor, and large heads. There are patterns of small, but noticeable tubercles on the armor, with the arrangement varying from species to species. Anatomy The bony armor of placoderms surrounds the head and trunk of the animal, and is divided into several interlocking plates that fused together. Microbrachids are recognized for their large armor plates around the head and shorter thoracic plates. Species =M. dicki= The type species is from Upper Givetian freshwater strata of Scotland and Estonia, including the John O'Groats sandstone of Caithness, and the Eday beds of the Orkney islands. It is named after its discoverer, Robert Dick. Total armor length is an average of 3 centimeters. It lived about 385 million years ago and is the earliest gnathostome in which internal fertilization has been identified. Newly discovered fossils of M. dicki found in Estonia in 2013 demonstrate clear evidence of unique male and female sexual organs, with males possessing claspers, and females developing fixed plates to lock the claspers in for mating. Separate male and female organs indicate these fish would have been capable of internal fertilization similar to sharks and other cartilaginous fishes, rather than broadcasting gametes externally into the water column like most modern bony fishes. The finding also served to reveal the unusual mating strategy used by this ancient group, which involved a sideways position with their bony arms locked together.

It was discovered in Gavrilchitsy Core 45 (rock core sample) taken by A. Gursenko in 1954 located near village of Gavrilchitsy, Belarus along with unidentifiable osteolepid remains. The specimen was recently described in March 2018 as a new species of Microbrachius closely related to M. dicki. The specimen was from a single siltstone sample located at a depth of 225.25-228.95m. This siltstone correlates to the Moroch Beds of the Polotsk Region Stage. Dating of the Moroch Beds puts M. kedoae in the Late Middle Devonian during the late Givetian stage approximately 385 Ma. M. kedoae is currently recognized as the youngest member of the genus along with M. dicki that occurs in laterally correlative beds.

Most modern fish and amphibians fertilize externally by releasing their gametes into the water, where fertilize. M. dicki is the earliest placoderm and vertebrate that shows evidence of internal fertilization. This has been observed in several new specimens that clearly display sexual dimorphism between males and females in the species. These specimens have been found to either have bone claspers for the males or plates for the females, at the end of their armor plates. Reinterpretation of several more derived placoderms have shown similar structures to the condition in M. dicki.Long, J. A., Mark-Kurik, E., Johanson, Z., Lee, M. S. Y., Young, G. C., Zhu, M., Ahlberg, P. E., Newman, M., Jones, R., den Blaauwen, J., Choo, B. & Trinajstic, K. 2015. Copulation in antiarch placoderms and the origin of gnathostome internal fertilization. Nature, 517, 196-199. =Male claspers anatomy= The clasper of M. dicki is a deeply grooved dermal bone that curves laterally at almost a 90 degree angle to the side of the animal. The clasper extends in length laterally from the mid line past the width of the trunk shield. These claspers are fused with the posterior ventrolateral plate and to each other. This would suggest that these claspers were incapable of moving. Additionally' there is a groove located on the ventral surface of the clasper. Current hypotheses suggested that the groove was used for sperm delivery either in the form of a transport channel for the sperm or was used for an encased structure that carried the sperm canal. The male clasper having a width wider than the trunk shield would allow males and females to enter coatis from the side as apposed from other angles. Other placoderms such as ptyctodontid placoderms have similarly-shaped claspers. For example, the clasper of Austroptyctodus gardineri is a dermal bone that curves laterally to the side of the animal and resembles a hook. =Female genital plate anatomy= Female specimens of M. dicki show paired blade-like structures in the same region of the animal that the claspers are in the males. These blades are ornamented with curving ridges and marginal tubercles on their dorsal (internal) surfaces facing the cloacal chamber and are fused to each other and posterior ventral lateral plate as well. The plates are flat and taper to the lateral ends of the transverse ventral ridge inside the lateral lamina of the posterior ventrolateral plate. These blade like structures have been interpreted as female genital plates. These genital plates suggest that they were used as a grip surface for the male clasper to attach to during copulation. Other placoderms such as the antiarch Pterichthyodes milleri, have identical ornamentation on the dorsal surfaces of the genital plate. Additional, the antiarch Bothriolepis sp. display semicircular plates located in the same anatomical area suggesting that these specimens are females and structures used for mating. =Differences from other groups= Microbrachichiidae is identified as earliest branching placoderm lineage with claspers. Other placoderm groups such as ptyctodonts and arthrodires display evidence of similar innovations. The clasper structure in Microbrachius is clearly different from the pelvic girdle and pelvic fin. In other more derived antiarchs such as asteolepidoids and bothriolepioids, there is a complete lack of pelvic girdle and fins. In ptyctodont and arthrodire placoderms, the clasper is immediately posterior to the pelvic fin. Arthrodire claspers do not articulate directly with the pelvic girdle or fin. In ptyctodonts, the endoskeleton of the clasper was unossified (unknown affinity to other structures) but away from pelvis. Placoderms differ from chondrichtyans by having their claspers independent from the pelvis and pelvic fin. =Mating behavior= One such specimen shows two individuals preserved next to each other in what has been inferred to be side by side mating. As the male and female engaged in coitis, the animals have interlocked claspers to genital plate in a side by side position. Additionally the specimens show the use of interlocked pectoral appendages, possibly to additional help copulation. =Implications= New specimens of M. dicki have started the conversation of which is the primitive state for reproduction in vertebrates, internal or external fertilization? The traditional model is that external fertilization is the primitive state with internal fertilization evolving at different times in different clades. The discovery of mating specimens M. dicki gives the oldest proof of internal fertilization in jawed vertebrates. This lends credence to the possibility that internal fertilization evolved first and that actinopterygian fish and most lissamphibians (living amphibians) modified or lost these claspers and plates into forms for external fertilization.

One way of understanding this is that if we know what is right, we will do what is right.The Moral Intellectualism of Plato's Socrates The Case of the Hippias Minor However, it can also be interpreted as the understanding that a rationally consistent worldview and theoretical way of life, as exemplified by Socrates, is superior to the life devoted to a moral (but merely practical) life. Ancient moral intellectualism For Socrates (469‚Äì399 BC), intellectualism is the view that \\"one will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best\\"; that virtue is a purely intellectual matter, since virtue and knowledge are cerebral relatives, which a person accrues and improves with dedication to reason. (Definition and note on Socrates) So defined, Socratic intellectualism became a key philosophic doctrine of Stoicism.Ancient Ethical Theory The Stoics are well known for their teaching that the good is to be identified with virtue. The apparent, problematic consequences of this view are \\"Socratic paradoxes\\", such as the view that there is no weakness of will (that no one knowingly does, or knowingly seeks to do, what is morally wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that since virtue is knowledge, there cannot be many different virtues such as those defended by Aristotle, and instead, all virtues must be one. The following are among the so-called Socratic paradoxes:p. 14, Terence Irwin, The Development of Ethics, vol. 1, Oxford University Press 2007; p. 147, Gerasimos Santas, \\"The Socratic Paradoxes\\", Philosophical Review 73 (1964), pp. 147‚Äì64. * No one desires evil. * No one errs or does wrong willingly or knowingly. * Virtue‚Äîall virtue‚Äîis knowledge. * Virtue is sufficient for happiness. Contemporary philosophers dispute that Socrates's conceptions of knowing truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post‚ÄìCartesian conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism. Typically, Stoic accounts of care for the self required specific ascetic exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a good person. Therefore, to understand truth meant \\"intellectual knowledge\\", requiring one's integration to the (universal) truth, and authentically living it in one's speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the Classical-era rhetorical device of parrhesia: \\"to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking\\"; and, by extension, practice the moral obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject, Lectures at the College de France 1981‚Äì1982. Picador: New York This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as rational undertakings.

The flag's legal basis is Muslim Autonomy Act No. 12, in which it is legally referred to as the ARMM's Official Regional Emblem. This law was passed by the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly on 15 June 1992 and signed into law by Regional Governor Zacaria Candao on 16 July 1992. The law identifies the flag as \\"reflective of [the Region's] legend, historical aspirations, and cultural heritage.\\" Design and Specifications The flag is a horizontal triband of blue, white and red, each of equal width. On the blue stripe is a big yellow star, fixed 8 inches (0.66 feet) from the hoist edge. On the red stripe is a silver kris, fixed 8 inches (0.66 feet) from the hoist edge with the handle on the hoist side of the stripe. Centered within the white stripe is a green circle, contained within which is a yellow crescent moon. The moon is positioned at \\"an acute angle...towards the big star,\\" and embracing four smaller yellow stars. According to Section 3 of MMAA No. 12 the official dimensions of the flag are 3 feet by 5.5 feet, giving it a width:length proportion of 6:11; per Section 4 of the same law the flag may also be reproduced in smaller sizes for \\"ceremonial and symbolic functions and activities.\\" The flag is described in Section 3 of MMAA No. 12 as if it were vertically displayed: the colors are listed from \\"left\\" to \\"right\\" instead of top to bottom; the kris handle and the big star are distanced 8 inches from the \\"top\\" (i.e. the hoist); and the tip of the kris blade is identified as pointing \\"downwards.\\" The flag is explicitly identified as containing six distinct colors: blue, white red, yellow, green and silver. However the 1992 ARMM flag law does not define the exact shade of these colors. The lack of specifications on other elements ‚Äî the exact length, shape/form and blade orientation of the kris; the exact size and shape of the big star and which direction its apex points towards; the exact size of the circular emblem; the exact sizes, shapes and orientations of the small stars and the crescent moon, as well as their arrangements ‚Äî has also resulted in the proliferation of many flag variations. Variants which incorrectly orient the crescent moon toward the fly, instead of positioning it at an angle facing the big star at the upper hoist, also exist and continue to be in use. =Number of small stars= Unofficial variant with five small stars After the accession of Basilan into the Autonomous Region in 2001 the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly enacted Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 138 in November 2002 to legally amend the design of the Official Seal of the Autonomous Region by increasing the number of stars from four to five. However the Regional Legislative Assembly has not yet made any amendment to the original ARMM flag law (MMAA No. 12), making the design with four smaller stars the de jure official version. At present versions with five or six smaller stars are also in prevalent use around the Autonomous Region. The version with five smaller stars reflect the current number of the Autonomous Region's constituent provinces and is thus the most symbolically accurate version of the regional flag. Those with six smaller stars were only symbolically accurate from 2006 to 2008, when the province of Shariff Kabunsuan briefly existed. Symbolism Per Section 3 of MMAA No. 12, the elements within the regional flag are officially interpreted as follows: Colors: *Blue ‚Äî \\"peace and tranquility\\" *White ‚Äî \\"purity and righteousness\\" *Red ‚Äî \\"the bloody struggle of [the region's] people for self-identity and self-determination\\" *Green and yellow within the central emblem ‚Äî \\"the abundance of vegetation in, and the culture of the inhabitants of, the Autonomous Region\\" Other elements: *Big star ‚Äî \\"the Sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines over the Autonomous Region and its constituent Provinces\\" *Crescent moon ‚Äî \\"the predominance of the Muslim inhabitants in the Autonomous Region\\" *Four smaller stars ‚Äî the region's original constituent Provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi *Kris ‚Äî \\"a symbol of authority used by the major tribes in the Autonomous Region,\\" as well as \\"the valor and perseverance of the Bangsamoro people in their quest for self- rule.\\" Use The ARMM regional flag is to be raised in mast to the left of the Philippine flag, at a distance of at least 2 meters apart from each other. The ARMM flag's mast is always to be one foot (0.3 meters) lower in height. It is mandatory for the flag to be displayed in all educational institutions (public and private schools, colleges and universities), public offices, government institutions and government-owned or -controlled corporations within the Autonomous Region. The flag may also be used ‚Äî \\"where necessary\\" ‚Äî in \\"ceremonial and symbolic functions and activities,\\" using smaller reproductions of the flag. The flag was adopted as provisional by the successor region of the ARMM, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Under the new region's charter, the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro region is entitled to have its own flag and coat of arms to be legally referred to as the \\"Bangsamoro symbol\\".

The purpose was to obtain control of local air strips, which could be used as forward bases by fighter aircraft for operations further south. The first invasion was at Batan Island on 8 December 1941. This was followed by Vigan, Legaspi, Davao, and Jolo Island over the next few days Disposition of forces Prior to World War II, Aparri was considered a substantial port city, with a population of 26,500. However, although located at the mouth of the Cagayan River, it is isolated from the rest of Luzon by mountain ranges to the east, west, and south. Manila and the central plains of Luzon were connected to Aparri by Route 5 through the narrow Balete Pass to the south, or by a long coastal route. The Cagayan Valley was not regarded by the Americans as a route of invasion. The area of Aparri was in theory defended by General Wainwright's North Luzon Force. However, with only a few men and a large territory to cover, Wainwright could spare only one partially trained and equipped Philippine Army division, the 11th Division, commanded by Colonel William E. Brougher, for all of northern Luzon. A reserve division, the 11th had begun to mobilize only in September and was at only two-thirds of its authorized strength of 1500 men per regiment. It also suffered from a serious shortage of equipment, including almost all of its artillery and transports. This division maintained only one battalion in the entire Cagayan Valley, with only one company actually at Aparri. On the Japanese side, General Homma had organized a detachment from the IJA 48th Division‚Äôs 2nd Infantry Regiment under Colonel Toru Tanaka. This numbered approximately 2000 men of the 2nd Battalion, half the 1st Battalion and the regimental headquarters. The invasion force was supported by a flotilla of the Imperial Japanese Navy led by Vice Admiral Kenzaburo Hara, consisting of the light cruiser , destroyers , , , , , , three minesweepers, six anti-submarine craft and six transports. The fleet deployed from Mako in the Pescadores and arrived at Aparri before dawn on 10 December. The landing operation was covered by aircraft of the IJAAF 24th and 50th Fighter Regiments launched from the airfield at Batan island captured the day before. Landing and aftermath The landing operation at Aparri faced no opposition from American forces; however, after two companies had landed rough seas and winds forced a shift in location to Gonzaga, some 20 miles to the east. Reports of the landing soon reached General MacArthur‚Äôs headquarters in Manila, where it was correctly assumed that the objective was to seize airfields from which fighters could deploy for operations further south. However, General Wainwright considered the landing at Aparri to be a feint to divide his already weak defenses, and decided not to offer resistance aside from destroying bridges on the route from Balete Pass. As the Japanese were unloading at Gonzaga, two B-17 Flying Fortress bombers from Clark Field attacked the transports. One of the aircraft was piloted by Captain Colin Kelly, who reported that he had attacked and severely damaged a Japanese battleship before he was shot down. Kelly was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and was extensively portrayed in Allied propaganda as the first war hero for flying his damaged aircraft into the smokestack of the battleship as the first kamikaze; however, there were no Japanese battleships in the area, and the only losses suffered by the Japanese in this attack was slight damage to the light cruiser Natori, and the loss of minesweeper W-19,which was holed and beached. The Tanaka Detachment reported capture of Aparri airfield by 1300, and the airfield at Camalaniugan by evening. Construction troops began work immediately on expanding the runways and establishing depot facilities. The IJAAF 50th Sentai with 36 Nakajima Ki-27 fighters was operational at Aparri from the following day. By 12 December, the Tanaka Detachment has also secured Tuguegarao airfield, fifty miles to the south. With the Americans on the run, Homma decided to leave only a small garrison at Aparri, and to move the bulk of his combat forces to south to assist the invasion force at Lingayen Gulf.  Consequences In retrospect, the advance landings by the Japanese in northern Luzon, including at Aparri, accomplished little of strategic or tactical value. The air fields seized were small, and with the rapid advance of the Japanese into central Luzon, were soon unnecessary for further operations.

It is in length. Named tributaries of the creek include South Branch Newport Creek. The entire watershed of Newport Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. Course Newport Creek begins in the community of Glen Lyon. It flows in an east-northeast direction into Luzerne County, not far from some strip mines. The creek parallels the Delaware and Hudson Railroad for some distance before turning north and then northeast to follow the railroad. The creek gets much closer to the strip mines at this point. It continues east, out of Newport Township and into the community of Nanticoke, where the tributary South Branch Newport Creek flows into Newport Creek. Newport Creek then flows through Nanticoke, passing a mountain known as Honey Pot. At this point, the creek turns north and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. =Tributaries= There are several major tributaries of Newport Creek, including South Branch Newport Creek. South Branch Newport Creek's headwaters are in an area of wetland between Penobscot Mountain and Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain. Other tributaries include UNTUnnamed tributary 28347, UNT 64681, UNT 28345, and UNT 28346. South Branch Newport Creek also has a tributary known as Reservoir Creek. Middle Branch Newport Creek is also a tributary of Newport Creek, as is North Branch Newport Creek, which has no tributaries.

Newport Creek was described as \\"a stream of moderate volume\\" in 1913. Geology, geography, and climate The watershed of Newport Creek is in the Allegheny Mountain section of the ridge and valley geological region. The creek's headwaters are or higher in elevation than the mouth. The lowest elevation in the watershed is at the creek's confluence with the Susquehanna River and the highest elevation is on Penobscot Mountain. Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain is found in the southern part of the watershed. Most of the Newport Creek watershed is in the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. There are glaciofluvial deposits from the pleistocene epoch in parts of the watershed. Nearly all (approximately 90%) of the Newport Creek watershed is occupied by interbedded sedimentary rock. The remaining 10% is occupied by sandstone. There are at least 12 coal seams in the watershed, which are all in the Llwellyn Formation. Their thickness ranges from under to . The coal has a lower-than-average sulfur content of 0.6 to 0.8 percent. Some areas of quicksand have been observed in the Newport Creek watershed. The main rock formations in the Newport Creek watershed are the Llwellyn Formation, the Pottsville Formation, the Pocono Formation, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Duncannon Member. The Llwellyn Formation occupies much of the northern part of the watershed, including much of Newport Creek itself and some of the South Branch Newport Creek watershed, except for the southern part. South of the Llwellyn Formation is a band of the Pottsville Formation. South of the Pottsville Formation are larger areas of the Mauch Chunk Formation and the Pocono Formation. On the southern edge of the watershed is an area of the Duncannon Member. The Pottsville Formation is unusually thin (less than in the watershed, but is the lowest rock formation in the watershed in terms of distance below ground. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil association and the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil association together occupy 95% of the watershed. The remaining 5% is occupied by the Wellsboro-Oquaga-Morris and the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil associations. There are five major sources of acid mine drainage in the Newport Creek watershed. One of these is the Glen Lyon Borehole, which is located at the creek's headwaters. The Susquehanna #7 Mine Discharge, the largest source of pollution in the watershed, is from the mouth of the creek. It has a discharge of 4.7 to 19 cubic feet per second. The temperature in the area of the Newport Creek watershed ranges from in January to in July. As of 1974, the average snowfall in the watershed is per year. On average, of rainfall in the Newport Creek watershed per year. In the watershed of South Branch Newport Creek, there is an average annual runoff of . Watershed The Newport Creek watershed has an area of . There are of streams in the watershed. The watershed is bounded by the community of Nanticoke on the eastern side and the watershed of Black Creek. It is up to long from east to west and up to long from north to south. Communities in the Newport Creek watershed include Alden, Glen Lyon, Nanticoke, Newport Center, Sheatown, and Wanamie. Wilkes-Barre is northeast of the watershed and Hazleton is south of the watershed. Pennsylvania State Route 3002 and a number of township roads are found in the watershed. The creek drains much of a coal sheet known as Sheet No. 2. Its tributaries drain part of the coal sheet Mine Sheet No. 1. Much of the Newport Creek watershed is forested. However, there are significant areas of developed land in the eastern part of the watershed. Other land uses in the watershed area agricultural and disturbed land. The headwaters of the Newport Creek watershed are on Penobscot Mountain and Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain. Newport Lake, a lake of mine drainage, is in the creek's watershed. Fairchild Pond and the Wanamie Reservoir are also present in the sub-watershed of South Branch Newport Creek. Najaka Pond and Kielar Lake used to drain into Newport Creek or its tributaries, but mining in the watershed has intercepted their discharge. History The Bloomery Forge was built on Newport Creek some time before January 1777 by Nathaniel Chapman, Joseph Beach, and Chris Alden. A stone bridge was once built over Newport Creek near the location of an old mill. A person named Chapman constructed a mill on the creek, which was eventually replaced one built by William Jackson. For a number of years, Jackson's mill was the only mill in Newport Township. Coal mining began in the Newport Creek watershed in the middle of the 1800s, with deep mines being established in this period. A mine disaster occurred on the creek near Nanticoke on November 18, 1885. The mines were most active in the 1920s and in 1924, 35 million tons were produced. The production rate dropped slightly after the 1920s and entered a steady decline in the 1950s. Strip mines were established in the watershed in the middle of the 1900s. Deep mining in the watershed ended in the 1950s, but strip mining continues in the 21st century. Much of the watershed has been mined.

On the Japanese side, General Homma had organized a detachment from the IJA 48th Division‚Äôs 2nd Infantry Regiment under Colonel Kanno. This numbered approximately 2000 men of the 3rd Battalion, and half the 1st Battalion. The invasion force was supported by a flotilla of the Imperial Japanese Navy led by Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura, consisting of the light cruiser , the destroyers , , , , , , , six minesweepers, nine anti-submarine craft and six transports The fleet deployed from Mako in the Pescadores and arrived at Vigan before dawn on 10 December. The landing operation was covered by aircraft of the IJAAF 24th and 50th Fighter Regiments launched from the airfield at Batan Island captured the day before. Landing and aftermath At the same time as the landing operation at Aparri, the Kanno Detachment disembarked at Vigan faced no opposition from American forces; however, reports of the landing was conveyed to General MacArthur‚Äôs headquarters in Manila by a reconnaissance Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, and the Far East Air Force launched a response consisting of five Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and escorting P-40 and Seversky P-35 fighters of the 34th Pursuit Squadron. The initial detachment from the Kanno Detachment quickly secured the city of Vigan by 1030 in the morning; however as at Aparri, the Japanese landing operation was hampered by heavy seas and strong winds. The American aircraft attacked the Japanese fleet with bombs and strafing attacks, and one of the Japanese transports, the Oigawa Maru was forced to beach to prevent sinking. A second transport, the Takao Maru was also beached in a subsequent attack, and one minesweeper, was sunk. The Japanese also had casualties on the destroyer Murasame and light cruiser Naka (which suffered 3 crewmen killed) and 30 men in the transport Hawaii Maru were wounded, despite air cover by eighteen fighters of the IJAAF 24th Fighter Regiment. Due to continuing bad weather, the Vigan Landing Force was shifted four miles to the south, where it was finally able to land the remainder of the Kanno Detachment on 11 December. A small detachment was quickly sent north to capture Laoag, capital of Ilocos Norte Province, fifty miles away, along with its airfield. With the Americans on the run, Homma decided to leave only a small garrison at Vigan, and to move the bulk of his combat forces to south to assist the Japanese landing force at Lingayen Gulf. By 1300 on 20 December the Tanaka Detachment from Aparri and Kanno Detachments had joined together as a single regiment, and marched out of Vigan south along coastal Route 3. Repairing destroyed bridges along the way, the Japanese reached the town of reached Bacnotan by the evening of 21 December. Bacnotan was defended by elements of the Philippine 11th Division, but the Japanese made a flanking movement to the east and forced part of the defenders back, while cutting off reinforcements from the mountains to the east. The Japanese reached San Fernando, La Union, on the morning of the 22 December, only a few hours after the main elements of the IJA 14th Army began the Japanese invasion of Lingayen Gulf, just to the south.  Consequences In retrospect, the advance landings by the Japanese in northern Luzon, including at Vigan, accomplished little of strategic or tactical value. The air fields seized were small, and with the rapid advance of the Japanese into central Luzon, were soon unnecessary for further operations.

Early years The family of Tenaille de Vaulabelle originated in Clamecy, Ni√®vre, and became one of the main families of Ch√¢tel-Censoir. Jean-Baptiste Tenaille de Vaulabelle was killed by the crowd while defending the queen Marie-Antoinette in Versailles. Achille de Vaulabelle was his nephew. and √âl√©onore Tenaille de Vaulabelle his brother. Achille Tenaille de Vaulabelle was born in Ch√¢tel-Censoir, Yonne, on 28 October 1799. He joined the administration under the Bourbon Restoration as an attach√© to the cabinet of the office of the Prefect of the Yonne. He then went to Paris and became a journalist. In 1824 he published Le Nain jaune (Yellow Dwarf) and founded the liberal newspaper Pour et le Contre (Pro and Con). After the July Revolution this became the R√©volution de 1830. He was chief editor of the Messager. He worked at the National in 1838. He published the Modern history of Egypt (1835) and History of the Restorations (1844). The eight volumes of his Histoire des deux Restaurations (1844-1874), covering the Bourbon restoration in France 1814-1830, met with immediate and permanent success. His large history has been the most widely read study of the Restoration, and provided the facts used by most textbooks and popular accounts. His style is elegant, lively, with anecdotes, dialogues, and quotations. Long passages from key documents are included. His hatred of the monarchy shapes every chapter. Second Republic After the February Revolution, Alphonse de Lamartine offered Vaulabelle the embassy in London, then that in Berlin, which he refused. On 23 April 1848 he was elected to represent Yonne in the Constituent Assembly. He was a member of the Constitution Committee and chair of the Committee of Public Instruction. On 6 July 1848 he was appointed Minister of Public Instruction. Vaulabelle reorganized the inspections service and gave more importance to the study of history and modern languages. Vaulabelle resigned on 13 October 1848. After the presidential election of 10 December 1848 he joined the opposition. He was not re-elected to the Legislative Assembly and left politics. He devoted the rest of his life to his historical works. He died in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, on 27 March 1879. Works * 1815, Ligny-Waterloo, par A. de Vaulabelle,... 40 gravures par J.

The goal of the tail risk parity approach is to protect investment portfolios at the times of economic crises and reduce the cost of such protection during normal market conditions. In the tail risk parity framework risk is defined as expected tail loss. The tail risk parity concept is similar to drawdown parity Traditional portfolio diversification relies on the correlations among assets and among asset classes, but these correlations are not constant. Because correlations among assets and asset classes increase during tail risk events and can go to 100%, TRP divides asset classes into buckets that behave differently under market stress conditions, while assets in each bucket behave similarly. During tail risk events asset prices can fall significantly creating deep portfolio drawdowns. Asset classes in each tail risk bucket fall simultaneously during tail risk events and diversification of capital within buckets does not work because periods of negative performance of portfolio components are overlapped. Diversification across tail risk buckets can provide benefits in the form of smaller portfolio drawdowns and reduce the need for tail risk protection.

History The first fair in Blenheim Township, Oxford County, was held in 1850Tapley, John. (2013). \\"'Udderly amazing': Drumbo Fall Fair brings back memories\\", Woodstock Sentinel Review as a community event on John Spiers Farm, just outside of Drumbo. It started as an opportunity for local farmers to showcase their crops and livestock. The cattle show was one of the original activities when the fair started, and it has continued on today. The second year the Drumbo Fall Fair, which was still known as a local picnic for local farming families, was held on William Dicksons‚Äô farm. for the next few years a picnic was held on a different farm each year. On October 7, 1856, the first official Drumbo Fall Fair was held. The Muma farm north of Drumbo was chosen because of their new barn. People officially registered their products, in hopes of gaining a prize. Some of the categories were crops, produce, handcrafts, and more to show off as well as having the new barn for the horse show. The fair continued to move around the three local towns of Drumbo, Princeton, and Plattsville until 1891, when the Blenheim Agricultural Society set up permanent buildings in the town of Drumbo. These buildings were used until 1905, after which the exhibits were shown on the premises of the Drumbo Curling Club. On January 9, 1907, the Blenheim Agricultural Society changed its name to the Drumbo Agricultural Society. In 1967, a new Agricultural Hall was built and a new Exhibit Hall followed in the 1980s. The hall is used for various community functions during the remainder of the year. In 2006, the Drumbo Agricultural Hall underwent renovation. Fair activities The fair begins with the official Friday Night Opening, which includes a pie auction, the announcement of the top prizewinners of the exhibits, and homemade pies. Following intermission the featured entertainment performs on a stage that resembles the Grand Ole Opry. The entertainment has included the locally and regionally known musicians who sing tributes to country legends such as Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline. The Drumbo Fall Fair has engaged children and adults throughout the years with foot races, games, livestock shows, and the baking competition. In the 1940s to the 1950s, the Drumbo Fall Fair incorporated the Blenheim Township School Fair, and since then the schools in the township contribute to a children‚Äôs art display. There are many different activities that the fair has created and elaborated throughout the years. It has remained close to its original roots, with the small competitions between neighbours. Now there are over 100 different class sections for competition. These include the horse shows, 4-H, crops, arts and crafts, flowers, baking and more. Many events at the Fair celebrate and provide experiences with agriculture and family-farm traditions. Saturday and Sunday include horse shows, a beef show, Old McDonald‚Äôs Farm featuring an exhibit of local farm animals, exhibition buildings and tents filled with hundreds of entries featuring home baking competitions, quilt and handicrafts, flowers, garden vegetables, grain and corn, antiques, photo contest and the largest exhibition is the children‚Äôs tent, with ribbon winning entries from craft and baking creations, to junior farmers displaying their fruits and vegetables.Old fashioned county fair a hit for 162 years\\".

It is implanted via a tri-axial transcatheter technique and involves suturing together the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets. Medical use and Indications MitraClip is used for patients with severe secondary mitral valve regurgitation that is refractory to medical therapy. Primary mitral regurgitation is usually due to an organic cause whereas secondary mitral regurgitation is due to a secondary ischemia or cardiomyopathy. Open-heart surgery remains the preferred treatment option when possible for primary mitral regurgitation, due to the effectiveness and long-term record of the procedure in reducing mitral valve regurgitation. Secondary Mitral regurgitation however can have different options in management as surgery has not been proven in clinical trials to be superior The indications for using MitraClip are as follows: # Those with symptomatic 3+ or 4+ Chronic Moderate to severe or severe Mitral Regurgitation are not candidates for surgery # New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV # Favorable Anatomy: Mitral Valve area greater than 4.0 centimeter squared, Minimal Calcification/no cleft in grasping area, Flail width less than 15mm, flail gap less than 10mm # At least 1+ year of life expectancy Advantages Compared to patients who need open heart surgery, patients who received mitral clip have less need for a blood transfusion and have fewer ventilation days. When compared to the patient who has had open heart surgery, MitraClip was cheaper - approximately $2200 less per person - and the median stay in the hospital post mitral clip is 2.4 days. Contraindications 1\\\\. Patients who are unable to receive anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy 2\\\\. Active Mitral Valve Endocarditis 3\\\\. Mitral Valve Rheumatic Disease 4\\\\. Patient that has femoral venous, IVC, Intracardiac Thrombus Adverse Effects/Complications  The most common complication of transcatheter mitral valve repair is access site bleeding, although transfusion is generally required less often than with surgical mitral valve repair. Rare but serious complications can include infective endocarditis, mitral stenosis, and device embolization. In general, major adverse events in a 30-day post-procedural time period are significantly lower with a transcatheter versus surgical approach. In the EVEREST 2 Clinical Trial, new onset Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Kidney Failure is higher in MitraClip group when compared to the surgical group Barriers and Disadvantages Major obstacles of mitral clip include the novelty of the technology. As of 2016, there were only 75 centers in the US that were able to offer this technology. Each hospital needs skilled technicians and operators who know 2D and 3D Echo-cardiogram criteria for selecting mitral clip candidates, and who can assist with intraprocedural guidance when the mitral clip is installed. In addition, as of 2016, there is a lack of coverage of health insurance by Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services. According to the EVEREST 2 Trial, 20% of patients who received MitraClip required surgical repair vs 2% who received open heart surgery. Overall surgical repair has more of a pronounced effect in reducing mitral regurgitation Post Procedure Patients will need dual anti-platelet therapy for 6 months or more. Within the next 6 months, patients will need antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis for dental and urological procedures. History In 1996, Ottavio Alfieri proposed to Dr Mehmet Oz that the mitral valve only needed one suture to close a leak. Oz developed the idea to use a catheter to put one staple in and submitted the patent for MitraClip in 1997. He helped to create a start-up called Evalve Inc. in 1999, which later became a division of Abbott Laboratories. The company's first chief executive officer was Ferolyn Powell. She grew Evalve Inc. until the Abbott acquisition in 2009, and led a trial of 600 patients that revealed those using MitraClip reduced their hospitalizations in half and deaths by 38 percent. MitraClip was first implanted in 2003, obtained CE marking in Europe in 2008, and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013. The FDA obligated the company to run post-marketing studies to confirm the safety and efficacy of the device. Two industry-funded RCTs of the MitraClip in patients with mitral regurgitation and heart failure demonstrated mixed results. Abbott expanded its MitraClip training process in 2016, after several instances of surgical complications.

These highways were constructed, maintained, or funded by the Maryland State Roads Commission or Maryland State Highway Administration and assigned a unique or temporally unique number. Some time after the highway was assigned, the highway was transferred to county or municipal maintenance and the number designation was removed from the particular stretch of road. In some cases, a highway was renumbered in whole or in part. This list contains all or most of the state-numbered highways between 2 and 199 that have existed since highways were first numbered in 1927 but are no longer part of the state highway system or are state highways of a different number. Most former state highways have not had their numbers reused. However, many state highway numbers were used for a former highway and are currently in use. Some numbers have been used three times. The former highways below whose numbers are used presently, those that were taken over in whole or in part by another highway, or have enough information to warrant a separate article contain links to those separate highway articles. Highway numbers that have two or more former uses are differentiated below by year ranges. This list does not include former Interstate or U.S. Highways, which are linked from their respective lists. MD 17 Maryland Route 17 was the designation for most of what is now MD 33 between Claiborne and Easton in western Talbot County. The state highway was one of the original state-numbered highways marked in 1927. MD 17 was replaced with MD 33 when the two highways swapped numbers in 1940. MD 20 Maryland Route 20 was the designation for North Point Road, which originally ran from the tracks of an interurban near Fort Howard north through Edgemere and Dundalk in southeastern Baltimore County to US 40 in Baltimore. MD 20 was the main highway between Baltimore and Sparrows Point, which was accessed by MD 151 (Sparrows Point Road) from Edgemere. The interurban line connected Baltimore with Bay Shore Park, an amusement park that operated between 1906 and 1947 within what is now North Point State Park. As early as 1923 and late as 1928, a ferry connected Bay Shore Park with Rock Hall, thus briefly and indirectly connecting this MD 20 with the extant MD 20 in Kent County. The first section of MD 20 was constructed as a concrete road from Sparrows Point Road in Edgemere to Trappe Road at the hamlet of North Point in what is now Dundalk by 1921. The concrete road was extended from North Point to Baltimore in 1922 and 1923; those same years, a macadam road was built from Sparrows Point Road to the interurban tracks near Bay Shore Park. MD 20 was widened and resurfaced with bituminous concrete north of Edgemere by 1926. By 1934, MD 20 was proposed to be expanded from a width of to from Baltimore to MD 151 in Edgemere to serve the Sparrows Point industrial complex. In addition, MD 20 from MD 151 to the interurban near Bay Shore Park was proposed to be widened from to . The Edgemere portion of MD 20 was bypassed when a new four-lane divided highway--Sparrows Point Boulevard and North Point Boulevard --was completed from Sparrows Point to Wise Avenue in Dundalk in 1940 and 1941. Between 1942 and 1944, the remainder of North Point Boulevard was constructed from Wise Avenue to Baltimore as a wartime access project, including a cloverleaf interchange at MD 150. In addition, Erdman Avenue was extended as a four-lane divided highway to connect with North Point Boulevard, bypassing the segment of North Point Road between the boulevard and US 40 in the city of Baltimore. By 1946, MD 151 was applied to the four-lane divided highway connecting Baltimore with Sparrows Point, and MD 20 was assigned to four mainline segments and a spur of the old North Point Road: *MD 20A was the designation for the section of North Point Road from the ramp from southbound MD 151 to westbound MD 150 northwest to a dead end at the Canton Railroad near the Baltimore city limit. *MD 20B was the designation for the section of North Point Road from MD 151 and Cove Road in Dundalk northwest to a right-in/right- out interchange with eastbound MD 150 at the MD 150-MD 151 cloverleaf. *MD 20C was the designation for the section of North Point Road from MD 151 near Wise Avenue north to MD 151 near Cove Road in Dundalk. *MD 20D was the designation for the section of North Point Road from the former interurban track intersection at Penwood Avenue near Fort Howard north to MD 151 north of Edgemere. The portion of MD 20 from near Fort Howard to Sparrows Point Road in Edgemere was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1969. *MD 20E was an unnamed spur from MD 20C to a dead end near MD 20C's northern end near Cove Road. The portion of MD 20D from near Fort Howard to Sparrows Point Road in Edgemere, then MD 718, was transferred from state to county maintenance through a December 12, 1985, road transfer agreement. The remainder of MD 20D and all of MD 20A, MD 20B, MD 20C, and MD 20E were transferred to Baltimore County control through an October 1, 1998, road transfer agreement. One segment of MD 20 was constructed later and was not part of North Point Road. MD 20F was an unnamed connector from southbound MD 151 to MD 20D. The highway began as a loop ramp from southbound MD 151, crossed east over both directions of MD 151, and ended at MD 20D. What became MD 20F was constructed as one of several ramps built to connect MD 151 and MD 20 with the new Bethlehem Boulevard in 1957 and 1958. However, the road did not receive the MD 20F designation until 1976. MD 20F was replaced by an eastward extension of newly designated MD 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard) when Bethlehem Boulevard was transferred from Bethlehem Steel control to state maintenance through an October 17, 1989, road transfer agreement. Former MD 20F was destroyed by the reconstruction of I-695 and its junction with MD 151 and MD 158 completed in 1999. =References= MD 27 Maryland Route 27 was the designation for what became the original alignment of US 29 in Montgomery and Howard counties when the U.S. Highway was extended into Maryland in 1934. MD 27 roughly followed modern US 29 from the District of Columbia to White Oak, MD 650 from White Oak to Ashton, MD 108 from Ashton to the original village of Columbia, US 29 again and then Old Columbia Pike into Ellicott City. After US 29 was extended into Maryland, MD 27 was placed on most of its modern course from Germantown to Westminster, which had previously been MD 29. MD 29 Maryland Route 29 was the original designation for modern MD 27 from US 240 (now MD 355) in Germantown north to US 140 (now Main Street) in Westminster in Montgomery County, Howard, Frederick, and Carroll counties. MD 29 was redesignated MD 27 after US 29 entered Maryland in 1934, replacing the original MD 27 from Silver Spring to Ellicott City. MD 33 Maryland Route 33 was the designation for what is now MD 17 between Brunswick and Wolfsville in western Frederick County. The state highway was one of the original state- numbered highways marked in 1927. MD 33 was replaced with MD 17 when the two highways swapped numbers in 1940. MD 37 (1927-1935) Maryland Route 37 was the designation for what is now US 219 from the West Virginia state line near Redhouse north through Oakland to US 40 (now US 40 Alternate) at Keyser's Ridge in Garrett County. The state highway was one of the original state- numbered highways marked in 1927. MD 37 was replaced with a southern extension of US 219, which formerly ended at US 40 east of Grantsville, in 1935. MD 37 (1963-1998) Maryland Route 37 was the designation for a short stretch of McDonogh Road around its overpasses of Gwynns Falls, CSX's Hanover Subdivision, I-795, and the Baltimore Metro Subway near Garrison in western Baltimore County. The Maryland State Roads Commission relocated the road and built new bridges over Gwynns Falls and what was then the Western Maryland Railway between 1940 and 1942. The road was brought into the state highway system and designated MD 37 in 1963 and removed from the state highway system in 1998. MD 41 Maryland Route 41 was the designation for the highway between US 219 in Oakland and MD 38 in Deer Park in southern Garrett County. The first segment of the highway was completed from Oakland to Mountain Lake Park by 1927. The final portion of MD 41 was completed in 1938. The state highway was replaced by MD 135 in 1956. MD 44 Maryland Route 44 was the designation for the access road from MD 56 south to Fort Frederick State Park near Big Pool in western Washington County. The access road was designated MD 44 between 1946 and 1969. MD 45 Maryland Route 45 ran along Water St. in Frostburg. MD 46 Maryland Route 46 is the former designation of the segment of I-195 between MD 295 and BWI Airport in Linthicum in northwestern Anne Arundel County. MD 46 was assigned when the connector between the Baltimore-Washington Expressway and the new Friendship International Airport opened in 1950. The designation was replaced by I-195 when the Interstate fully opened in 1990. MD 48 Maryland Route 48 was the designation for Pine Ridge Road from US 220 northeast to the Pennsylvania state line near Dickens in central Allegany County. The highway was constructed as a concrete road by 1927. MD 48 was removed from the state highway system in 1950. MD 52 Maryland Route 52 was the designation for Williams Street and Williams Road from MD 51 in Cumberland east to Christie Road near Evitts Creek in central Allegany County. MD 52 began at MD 51, which followed Williams Street northwest toward downtown Cumberland and Louisiana Avenue south toward Oldtown. The highway was paved a concrete road from Cumberland to near Evitts Creek in 1923. MD 52 was extended east across Evitts Creek to Brashier Hollow Road by 1939. The highway was extended to Christie Road when the state rebuilt Williams Road between Brashier Hollow Road and Christie Road in 1952. MD 52 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. Part of MD 52's old course was brought back into the state highway system when MD 639 was extended south in 2008. MD 54 Maryland Route 54 was the designation for the portion of Main Street north of MD 17 in the town of Myersville and Canada Hill Road from the Myersville town limit to the road's intersection with Easterday Road in western Frederick County. MD 54 was constructed as a concrete road in Myersville in 1933. The highway was extended north to Easterday Road by 1946. MD 54 was removed from the state highway system in 1956 immediately after the state resurfaced the route. MD 59 Maryland Route 59 was the designation for Holter Road from US 340 in Jefferson north to MD 17 in Middletown in western Frederick County. Construction on the concrete highway began from the Middletown end and the first section was completed in 1929. A second segment of MD 59 was started in 1929 and completed in 1930. The third portion of the highway was started in 1930. MD 59 was extended south to Teen Barnes Road near Jefferson in 1933. The highway was proposed to extend to US 340 in 1933. However, MD 59 was not completed until the final stretch from Teen Barnes Road to US 340 was completed as a concrete road in 1938. MD 59 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 61 Maryland Route 61 was the designation for a section of Old Forge Road from Antietam Drive eastward near Hagerstown in northern Washington County. The highway was constructed by Washington County with state aid in 1916. MD 61 was removed from the state highway system in 1956; part of the route's former path is now occupied by a quarry. MD 69 Maryland Route 69 was the designation for Jefferson Boulevard and Maryland Avenue from Mount Zion Road north to US 40 Alternate in Braddock Heights in western Frederick County. MD 69 was paved by Frederick County with state aid by 1911. The highway was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 70 Maryland Route 70 was the designation for Knoxville Road from US 340 in Knoxville east to Brunswick in western Frederick County. MD 70 was constructed by 1927. The highway was replaced with a westward extension of MD 464 in 1950. MD 478 was assigned to Knoxville Road by 1971. MD 71 (1927-1956) Maryland Route 71 was the designation for what is now MD 194 from MD 26 in Ceresville to the Pennsylvania state line near Taneytown in Frederick and Carroll counties. Much of the highway was constructed in Frederick County by 1927. MD 71 was changed to MD 194 in 1956 to match Pennsylvania Route 194, taking its number from the original MD 194 and handing the number to much of what is now US 301. MD 71 (1956-1959) Maryland Route 71 was the designation for the Blue Star Memorial Highway from US 50 in Queenstown to the Delaware state line near Warwick. MD 71 was assigned to the highway when it was completed in 1956. US 301 replaced the highway when the U.S. Highway was extended into Delaware in 1959. MD 71 connected to Delaware Route 71 at the state line during its short existence. MD 72 Maryland Route 72 was the designation for Lewistown Road, Old Frederick Road, and Creagerstown Road from US 15 in Lewistown east and then north through Creagerstown to a point south of MD 77 near Loys Station between Thurmont and Rocky Ridge in northern Frederick County. MD 72 was constructed as a concrete road by Frederick County with state aid from Lewistown to Links Bridge Road south of Creagerstown between 1919 and 1921. The highway was extended as a concrete road to the south end of Creagerstown in 1925 and 1926 and through Creagerstown in 1926 and 1927. MD 72 was extended to its northern terminus south of Loys Station in 1932. All of MD 72 except the portion through Creagerstown that is now MD 550 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 73 Maryland Route 73 was the designation for Yellow Springs Road from the old Frederick city limits on what is now 7th Street south of the US 15 freeway north to Yellow Springs. The first section of MD 73 was constructed as a macadam road for about north of the city limits in 1928. The highway was extended northwest to what is now Clover Hill by 1930 and to Tuscarora Creek by 1933. MD 73 was completed to Yellow Springs in 1935. MD 73 between Military Road and Clover Hill passed along the edge of and then directly through Fort Detrick until 1957, when the road through the military base was closed to the public. Yellow Springs Road was relocated around Fort Detrick from Clover Hill southeast to connect with Rosemont Avenue in Frederick. By 1961, the southern end of MD 73 was at Clover Hill. The remainder of MD 73 was removed from the state highway system in 1969. MD 74 Maryland Route 74 was the designation for Oppossumtown Pike from the old Frederick city limits on what is now Motter Avenue south of the US 15 freeway north to Poole Jones Road. MD 74 was paved as a macadam road north about from the city limits between 1926 and 1928. The highway was extended north to its northern terminus by 1939. MD 74 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 78 Maryland Route 78 was the designation for Ballenger Creek Pike from what was the southern terminus of MD 351 near Adamstown north to US 340 near Frederick in southern Frederick County. The first portion of MD 78 was completed by 1927; the remainder of the highway was completed by 1938. MD 78 was replaced by an extension of MD 180 in 1970. All of former MD 78 became MD 351 in 1989. MD 81 Maryland Route 81 was the designation for Sabillasville Road and Military Road from MD 806 (former US 15) in Thurmont north to Fort Ritchie in northernwestern Frederick County and far northeastern Washington County. MD 81 was completed from Thurmont to Sabillasville by 1927. The highway was replaced by a northern extension of MD 550 in 1977. MD 82 Maryland Route 82 was the designation for Leland Avenue and Maple Avenue from MD 191 in Bethesda east to MD 410 in Chevy Chase in southern Montgomery County. MD 82 constructed in three sections. Leland Avenue from MD 191 through the intersection with US 240 (now MD 355) to 46th Street in Bethesda and Maple Avenue in Chevy Chase were paved in concrete in 1929. The middle segment along Leland Avenue in the town of Chevy Chase was constructed by the town; the macadam street was brought into the state highway system in 1933. The portion of MD 82 through the town was transferred to municipal maintenance by 1985. The portion of MD 82 in Bethesda was transferred to Montgomery County in 1997. MD 85 Maryland Route 85 was the designation for an L-shaped highway through Middleburg in western Carroll County. MD 85 began at the Western Maryland Railway along Johnsville Road south of Middleburg, then turned east on Middleburg Road to its end east of Bucher John Road near the hamlet of Feesersburg. The highway was constructed by Carroll County with state aid as a macadam road between 1911 and 1915. MD 85 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 87 Maryland Route 87 was the designation for the portion of Leisters Church Road from a point near Dufrow Road and Neudecker Road near Carrollton north to MD 31 in Mexico in eastern Carroll County. MD 87 was paved as a concrete road from MD 31 (now MD 852) in Mexico southeast to Gorsuch Road in 1925. The highway was extended to its southern end in 1933. MD 87 south of MD 482 was transferred to county control in 1956; the portion in Mexico became a western extension of MD 482. Around 1960, MD 482 was relocated on its current course west to a relocation of MD 31, which later became MD 27. The portion of Leisters Church Road between MD 852 and MD 482 is now MD 849. MD 89 Maryland Route 89 was the designation for Lower Beckleysville Road from MD 88 in Hampstead east to the Carroll-Baltimore county line. The highway was constructed by Carroll County with state aid as a concrete road between 1919 and 1921. MD 89 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 90 Maryland Route 90 was the designation for the portion of Houcksville Road from a point near Hoffman Mill Road near Houcksville north to MD 30 (now MD 30 Business) in Hampstead in eastern Carroll County. The highway was paved by Carroll County with state aid as a macadam road between 1911 and 1915. MD 90 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 92 Maryland Route 92 was the designation for Water Street and Fruit Tree Drive from MD 64 (now MD 66) in Smithsburg to east of Greensburg Road east of Smithsburg in northeastern Washington County. The highway was constructed as a macadam road in 1934. MD 92 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. The following year, MD 491 was completed parallel to old MD 92 near Smithsburg. There may have been another segment of MD 92 from the Western Maryland Railway crossing at Edgemont north to Mong Road northeast of Smithsburg built by 1939. Note that Google Maps shows another MD 92 from MD 64 via Rowe Road to Unger Road (probably decommissioned much more recently). MD 93 Maryland Route 93 was the designation for Oakland Mills Road and Oakland Road from MD 26 at Shervettes Corner north and east to the Carroll-Baltimore county line at the North Branch of the Patapsco River. The highway was constructed by Carroll County with state aid as a concrete road between 1919 and 1921. MD 93 connected with Oakland Road on the Baltimore County side of the river, but that connection was severed when Liberty Reservoir filled in 1954. The state highway was transferred to county maintenance in 1956. MD 95 Maryland Route 95 was the designation of the portion of Comus Road west from MD 109 at Comus in northern Montgomery County. The highway was constructed as a concrete road in 1929 and 1930.

MD 100 Maryland Route 100 was the designation for the portion of Old Frederick Road from MD 99 at St. Johns Lane near Ellicott City east to the Howard-Baltimore county line at the Patapsco River. Much of the highway was constructed as a macadam road from the river west to approximately the modern intersection of US 29 and MD 99 in 1923. The gap from there to MD 99 was filled with a concrete road between 1930 and 1933. In 1956, the portion of MD 100 from MD 99 at St. Johns Lane to Rogers Avenue was replaced with an extension of MD 99 east along Old Frederick Road and south along Rogers Avenue; the portion of MD 100 east of Rogers Avenue was transferred to county maintenance. MD 101 Maryland Route 101 was the designation for Henryton Road from MD 99 near West Friendship north to the Howard-Carroll county line at the South Branch of the Patapsco River at Henryton.

Based in Breckenridge, Colorado since 1993, its members, who range in age from 18 to 29, are selected from auditions held each year throughout the United States. NRO presents an eight-week series including two orchestral programs per week conducted by its Music Director Carl Topilow (conductor and director of the orchestral program at the Cleveland Institute of Music) as well as guest conductors. The orchestra was founded in 1960 by cellist and conductor Walter Charles. The orchestra was formerly known as the Blue Jeans Symphony based in Estes Park, Colorado, and later as the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra based in Evergreen, Colorado. History =Blue Jeans Symphony, 1960-1966= The National Repertory Orchestra was founded as the Blue Jeans Symphony in 1960 by cellist and conductor Walter Charles. It was originally based in the summer resort town of Estes Park, Colorado. Charles had conceived the idea for an intensive summer training camp for aspiring orchestral musicians in the 1950s when he was the conductor of the Wichita Falls Symphony Orchestra and chose Estes Park after vacationing there with his wife. The program was launched with 55 musicians and a $2000 grant from the town's chamber of commerce. In its early days, the young musicians worked all day in jobs at the resort and rehearsed from 10p.m. to midnight. This was a requirement for all the musicians, regardless of their ability to pay for their room and board, and one which Charles described at the time as \\"part of the philosophical training of the Blue Jeans program.\\" The orchestra performed their concerts in blue jeans, and Charles conducted in a denim white tie and tails especially made for him by Levi-Strauss.Bakemeier, Alice Millett (2006). \\"Music in the Mountains, The Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra\\". Historically Jeffco, Vol. 19, Issue 27, pp. 2‚Äì6. Jefferson County Historical Commission. Retrieved 15 January 2017. =Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra, 1966-1986= The program became increasingly successful in attracting students and looked to attracting a wider audience. In 1966, it changed its name to the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra and moved to Evergreen, Colorado. At the end of the 1977 season, a disagreement between Charles and the orchestra's board of directors led to his dismissal. The board had disagreed with his emphasis on classical music and wanted to broaden the repertoire to include lighter music. After a restructuring in 1978, the conductor and clarinettist Carl Topilow was appointed Music Director and Conductor. The orchestra hired its first business manager and placed an emphasis on stipends and scholarships which allowed the students twelve-hour days devoted to practising, rehearsing and performing in concerts. In addition to the classical concerts, they also began giving concerts which depended heavily on pops programming in open meadows, city streets, shopping centers and parks. In 1985, the orchestra performed at the Kennedy Center in a concert celebrating the 20th anniversary of the National Endowment for the Arts in a varied program of 20th-century music that included Billy Taylor playing his own Jazz Suite for Piano and Orchestra, Joel Hoffman's serial piece Between Ten, and Aaron Copland's A Lincoln Portrait.Tuck, Lon (30 September 1985). \\"Rocky Mountain High\\". Washington Post. Retrieved 15 January 2017. =National Repertory Orchestra, 1986-1993= By the mid-1980s, the orchestra's ambitions had grown beyond the point where it could be sustained by the small town of Evergreen. The increasingly peripatetic performances at Evergreen led to the Denver Post calling them \\"the guerilla orchestra\\" because they never knew where they would be playing next. According to Richard Zellner who served as the orchestra's Executive Director from 1982 until 2000, \\"we were a festival looking for a place to happen.\\"Kiefer, Michael (May 1989). \\"Blue Jeans Symphony\\". Snow Country, pp. 40‚Äì41 In 1986, the orchestra changed its name to the National Repertory Orchestra, drew up new articles of incorporation, and accepted an offer by Keystone Resort, in Keystone, Colorado to take up residency there. The orchestra provided an entertainment draw for the resort and the resort provided room and board for the musicians, a performing tent, and marketing services, all of which allowed the orchestra to halve its expenses. In 1988, the NRO was the only American orchestra invited to perform at the Seoul Olympics and then extended its tour to Taiwan and Japan. The Riverwalk Center in Breckenridge, Colorado, the NRO's performance base since 1993 =National Repertory Orchestra, 1993-present= The orchestra, conducted by Gilbert Levine, performed in Denver to mark Pope John Paul II's visit for World Youth Day in 1993.Brozan, Nadine (7 August 1993). \\"Chronicle\\".

Since that time, the Riverwalk Center, a 750-seat facility on the shores of the Blue River, has been the NRO's main performance base. Program The NRO is a non-profit organization supported by private and corporate sponsorships as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Each year the orchestra's 88 members, who all attend on fellowships, are chosen from auditions by approximately 900 young musicians between the ages of 18 and 29 who must have completed at least one year of college, university, or conservatory. The program lasts eight weeks during which the members learn and perform an entire season's orchestral repertoire. The orchestra gives two full orchestral concerts a week at the Riverwalk Center in Breckenridge and performs at events and concerts in various other towns in Colorado. The NRO musicians also attend masterclasses with visiting musicians, participate in the orchestra's education and community outreach programs, and take career development classes which include mock auditions, contract negotiations, finance for musicians, and training in music therapy.Row, Caitlin (15 September 2010). \\"Helping Hands: NRO provides musical opportunities for young people\\".

He was the British Chess Champion in 2015, having outscored David Howell, with whom he shared the title in 2014. Hawkins's chess career is unusual for the modern era in that he showed only modest ability as a child; his improvement from club player to International Master took place after he left full-time education, and while living in County Durham, far from traditional centres of chess activity. About this sudden rise through the rankings, in his 2012 endgame book Amateur to IM, he notes that \\"a careful study of the endgame sparked the biggest leap forward in my own game\\". As well as his double British championship titles, tournament wins by Hawkins include the British Rapidplay Chess Championships in 2012 and 2014, making him the British champion at both standard and rapid time limits. In 2013 he tied for first place in the 18th Vienna Open with Stanislav Novikov, Batuhan Dastan, Hagen Poetsch, Alexey Kim, Ralf √Ökesson and Kacper Drozdowski. Hawkins was part of the English contingent at the rapidplay tournament of the 2014 London Chess Classic. His game against former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik at that event was notable for its simultaneous attacks against both castled kings, and for the \\"exquisite Zugzwang\\" to which Hawkins succumbed. Hawkins attained the FIDE titles of FIDE Master (FM) in 2008, International Master (IM) in 2010 and Grandmaster (GM) in 2014. His ascent from IM to GM was delayed two years by a lack of results against non-English players. This meant he became one of the highest-rated IMs in the world, outranking the majority of English GMs, and was the first winner of the British Championship since Michael Hennigan in 1993 who had not earned the GM title by the end of the tournament. Hawkins is now a full-time chess player and coach, based in London.

Bilsky was also a philanthropist and founder of Ottawa's first synagogue, Adath Jeshuran.Bilsky (2009), p. 7‚Äì8.

He is credited with being the first Puerto Rican muralist whose work received international recognition.  Early years  R√≠os Rey was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on 28 July 1911 in a family of artists. His father was Octavio R√≠os De Jes√∫s (1886‚Äì1933) who was a scenographer for Russian dancer Anna Pavlova from 1918 to 1921. R√≠os Rey studied art under Miguel Pou with such other disciples as Olga Albizu, Horacio Castaign, and Luis Quero Chiesa.  Career  In 1934 Rios Rey studied mural painting under the migrant Spanish mural artist Ismael D'Alzina. In 1936 Rios Rey traveled to New York City where he was exposed to the American muralist movement and the main expositors of Mexican muralism such as Rufino Tamayo, Jos√© Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Sequeiros. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1937 where he established his painting studio. In 1950, Rios Rey traveled to Mexico where he studied metal engraving with Carlos Alvarado Lang, scenography with Antonio L√≥pez Mancera, mosaic with Jorge Best Benganzo and mural painting with Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado.  Style and characteristics  R√≠os Rey works the subject of the farm worker, the landscape of the island of Puerto Rico and the many industries and infrastructure building projects that embodied the life of the Puerto Rican people in the first half of the twentieth century. R√≠os Rey is the one Puerto Rican muralist that produced the largest number of murals in Puerto Rico ‚Äì over eighty. His murals can be seen today at the Banco Cr√©dito y Ahorro Ponce√±o, Cervecer√≠a India, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport, Little Rock School of Medicine, Ponce YMCA Building, and Puerto Rico Iron Works, in addition to many private residential locations. He also designed theatrical and operatic scenes in Puerto Rico and New York City. He painted numerous murals for hotels, banks, and public buildings. In addition he did art work for books. His works embodied the life of the poor jibaro countrymen on one end and the industrialization that took place in Puerto Rico in the 1950s at the other end.  Murals  Outstanding murals by Rios Rey are: * Tradiciones ponce√±as. [Ponce Traditions] (1953) at Plaza del Caribe, Ponce * La Fundici√≥n. [The Foundry] (1953) at Empresas Ferre.

He has worked in the field of chronic back pain and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In 1982, he designed the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring- wound catheter with a small fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, sometimes referred to as percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low- back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. Racz was born in Hungary and, as a young man, had aspirations to become a medical doctor. He was a second-year medical student in November 1956 when he was forced to flee Hungary after the Soviets invaded Budapest in response to the Hungarian Revolution. He eventually arrived in England and resumed his education. He graduated from the University of Liverpool School of Medicine, and worked in the UK until 1963 at which time he moved to the United States. He completed his anesthesiology residency at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He also worked as an associate attending anesthesiologist and respiratory consultant for other hospitals including the Veterans Administration Hospital, and the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York before moving to Lubbock, Texas where he became the first Chairman of Anesthesiology for the then-new Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC). Racz is also one of the founders of the World Institute of Pain. Early life and education Racz (circled) during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution Racz was born in Hungary to parents with a financially meager background which he attributed in part to his family's resistance to join the Communist party. He attended Semmelweis University Medical School, and it was during his second year there that the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 had begun. After seeing hundreds of injured people, he volunteered to help at the hospital. He said he received a signed directive to drive a truck and deliver sugar to the medical school clinics which he believed motivated the Hungarian Secret Police to seek him out for questioning. He also recalled a shooting incident where a bullet missed his head by \\"a few inches\\". On November 27, 1956, he fled from Budapest to Austria with his future wife Enid, his sister, brother-in-law, and a few others after the Soviets invaded the city. He had no prior intention to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said if they found him, \\"That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. Not that I had done anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime.\\" He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands. In 1957, as a former Hungarian medical student, Racz received a scholarship to attend second-year medical school in Liverpool, England. In 1962, he graduated from the University of Liverpool School of Medicine with Bachelor of Medicine (M.B.) and Bachelor of Surgery (Ch.B) degrees. Ian McWhinney and his wife helped Racz get his start as a doctor by providing him with rent-free lodging so he could finish his education. He said their generosity became a lifelong example in that \\"one must study and pass on knowledge and help the next generation.\\" Racz later served as house surgeon and physician at the Royal Southern Hospital in Liverpool. Career in the United States Racz (center) in a procedural lecture in 2012 In 1963, Racz moved to the United States for an anesthesiology residency at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. Upon completion, he worked in several positions at SUNY, including associate attending anesthesiologist and respiratory consultant in the neurological head injury unit as well as a consultant for the Veterans Administration Hospital, and the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital in Norwich, New York. In 1977, Racz joined the then-new Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) and was designated as the Center's first Chairman of Anesthesiology. He held that position until March 1, 1999. His work from 1977 to 2006 not only included treating patients, he also served as acting director of pain services at TTUHSC, and oversaw the expansion of operations and future development of the Messer-Racz International Pain Center named in recognition of Racz's work and the Messer family's financial contributions. In 2015, Racz held the designation of Professor and Chairman Emeritus, Director of Pain Services for Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Throughout his career, Racz has also conducted research and co-authored articles with other experts in pain management to improve diagnosis and treatment of complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS), a long-term disorder of the nervous system which is a challenging pain problem that is often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. Racz catheter and Racz procedure Racz's work with nerve stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and a wide range of other pain management procedures is being used in interventional pain practices throughout the world. He developed new designs in medical equipment and devices. In 1982, Racz designed the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter with a small fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, a minimally invasive, percutaneous procedure also known as the \\"Racz procedure\\", which is somewhat similar to an epidural. It is used to treat patients with chronic low back pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, which involves scar tissue that has formed around the nerve root. It is also used to treat protruding or herniated disks, fractures, degeneration, or radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The Racz procedure employs a wire-bound or spring loaded catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibroids, that have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. This procedure was assigned a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in 2000. Recognition and awards In 1996, Racz was the first recipient of the Grover E. Murray Professorship, TTUHSC's highest award. In December 1998, the University Medical Center named him to a $1 million endowed chair in recognition of his work at TTUHSC and the University Medical Center. In 2004, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. In October 2012, the New York/New Jersey Societies of Interventional Pain Physicians awarded Racz a lifetime achievement award. Selected works Racz has published in many forms.

The Ozette Indian Village, which was buried and preserved in a mudslide in the 1700s, has been called \\"the most significant archaeological dig of the 20th century\\" in the Pacific Northwest. Daugherty collaborated closely with the Makah during the dig, which uncovered more than 55,000 artifacts. Early Life and Education \\"Doc\\" Daugherty was born in Aberdeen, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula, on March 31, 1922. He developed an interest in archaeology as a child when he found buried objects around Grays Harbor. He enlisted during World War IIRichard D. Daugherty: A Faculty Biography (1991). Washington State University Anthro News. . Daugherty was based at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst in Lakehurst, New Jersey, where he flew blimps over the Atlantic to watch for potential German attacks. He enrolled at the University of Washington after the war, where he completed his bachelor‚Äôs degree in anthropology in 1946. He began work toward a doctorate in ethnography shortly thereafter. His dissertation studies were ultimately completed in 1953 but were at first delayed after he and several other graduate students oversaw salvage archaeological field work prior to dam construction at sites in the Columbia Plateau during the Columbia River Basin Surveys of 1946-1947. These were projects were enormous in scale--Daugherty, along with other young students, were tasked with surveying numerous reservoir sites throughout Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Reflecting years later, Daugherty stated that they had \\"little knowledge, almost no time, and they [the surveys] were extremely inadequate.\\" Still, this early work led to important discoveries at sites including Lind Coulee, which was the subject of his 1953 Ph.D. dissertation, Early Man in the Columbia Intermontane Province. Daugherty, R.D. (1953). Early Man in the Columbia Intermontane Province, Doctoral Dissertation. Seattle: University of Washington (unpublished).  Pacific Northwest Archaeology at Washington State University  Daugherty joined Washington State University (WSU)‚Äîthen Washington State College‚Äîas an instructor in anthropology in 1950 until the completion of his Ph.D., after which he was appointed an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology.. Daugherty's early experiences growing up in the Olympic Peninsula as well as his survey and Ph.D studies set the stage for later field studies and his career, which had an enormous impact on archaeological research in the Pacific Northwest region. At WSU, Daugherty oversaw numerous projects throughout the Columbia Plateau and Pacific Northwest Coast through contract archaeology and archaeological field schools. While at WSU, Daugherty led the establishment of a Quaternary research studies option in 1968 and recruited a skilled team of interdisciplinary scholars, including zooarchaeologist Carl \\"Gus\\" Gustafson, geologist Roald H. Fryxell, palynologist Peter J. Mehringer, and Frank C. Leonhardy. Other prominent colleagues include William Andrefsky, Vaughn Bryant, Donald Collier, William Lipe, Charles M. Nelson, David G. Rice, Harvey \\"Pete\\" Rice, and Roderick Sprague. \\"Doc\\" Daugherty also mentored or served on the committee of numerous students at WSU who became important archaeologists in their own right, including Kenneth Ames, Fumi Arakawa, Corey Breternitz, Mary Collins, Dale Croes, Judith Bense, Amy Gilreath, Leslie E. Wildesen, Janet Friedman, Paul Gleeson, Steve Hackenberger, Bennie Keel, David Kirkpatrick, Ruthann Knudson, Anan Raymond, Lee Sappington, Alston Thoms, Gary Wessen, Miranda Warburton, among many others. Today, there are two scholarships in Daugherty's honor at WSU, the Phyllis and Richard Daugherty Scholarship for Undergraduate Student Excellence, and the Phyllis and Richard Daugherty Scholarship for Graduate Student Excellence. Collections associated with Daugherty's archaeological excavations include those housed at curation facilities at the WSU Museum of Anthropology, the Makah Museum, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation History and Archaeology Division, and the University of Idaho Bowers Laboratory. Additionally, the Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC) at WSU houses the Richard D. Daugherty Papers, which include professional papers such as \\"correspondence, files related to his contracting business (Western Heritage Inc.), project files, papers related to his research and writing, and collected reference material.\\" Contributions to Cultural Resource Management Daugherty played a central role in shaping the role of archaeology in documenting and preserving archaeological heritage threatened by large-scale civic engineering projects. Before and after joining Washington State University as a faculty member, Daugherty took part in the Smithsonian Institution River Basin Surveys that preceded dam construction on the Columbia River. Through these surveys Daugherty, his colleagues, and students documented many important archaeological sites at Lind Coulee, Potholes Reservoir, Moses Lake, and elsewhere. . In connection with this work Daugherty founded and directed the Washington Archaeological Research center at Washington State University, which became assumed an important role in early contract archaeology in the Pacific Northwest United States. Daugherty also directed the excavation of the Marmes Rockshelter, in which 10,000-year- old human remains were discovered, before the area was submerged by water due to the construction of the Lower Monumental Dam on the Snake River in 1969. In 1966, Daugherty joined with both Washington state U.S. senators, Sen. Henry M. Jackson and Warren Magnuson, to successfully pass the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Subsequently, he was appointed by Lyndon Johnson as one of the original four expert members of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Many of \\"Doc's\\" students went on to have major careers in cultural resource management and public archaeology, including Judith Bense, Leslie E. Wildesen, Janet Friedman, Paul Gleeson, Bennie Keel, Ruthann Knudson, Gary Wessen, to name a few. Ozette Indian Village Archaeological Site and Tribal Collaboration In 1970, a winter storm uncovered the remains of a pre-European village at Cape Alava, now known as the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site, which had been buried by a mudslide in the 1700s. Edward Eugene Claplanhoo, who was chairman of the Makah at the time, immediately recognized the significance of the discovery. Claplanhoo contacted Richard Daugherty at Washington State University. Daugherty and Claplanhoo had known each other since the 1950s. In the early 1950s, Daugherty has served as the WCU freshman class adviser when Claplanhoo held office as the freshman class treasurer. Daugherty sought the advice of Claplanhoo and other Makah leaders during the excavation. While it is common today to consult with local and indigenous communities, Daugherty's manner of working with Makah officials was considered revolutionary at the time. According to Janine Bowechop, a historic preservation officer for the Makah, \\"He was so progressive at a time when it was so uncommon...Dr. Daugherty taught people how tribes and scientists can work together.\\" Claplanhoo lobbied on behalf of the Makah to keep the Ozette artifacts in local hands. The artifacts are now housed and displayed at the Makah Museum, which opened in 1979. In 2010, Ruth Kirk, an author of books on Ozette (and Daugherty's wife since 2007), spoke of Daugherty's and Claplanhoo close partnership on Ozette dig saying, \\"Ed and Dick were really instrumental in getting the museum set up. Usually, back then, artifacts were taken back to the university, but here Dick always wanted them, and Ed worked with him because the Makah wanted them to stay in Neah Bay...Now it is common to do that, but back then it was a new idea.\\" Daugherty and Ruth Kirk, a nature writer, co-authored Hunters of the Whale, which explored the early years of the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site through 1974. Kirk and Daugherty often collaborated, publishing, among other works another book, Archaeology in Washington, released in 2007. Later life and death Daugherty retired from Washington State University in 1983 after chairing dozens of graduate student committees and serving as chair of the Anthropology department. Daugherty continued his work in cultural resource management over the next decades through his private consulting firm Western Heritage, publishing numerous professional reports. Ruth Kirk and Daugherty, who were both widowed and longtime friends, married in 2007 in a wedding held in a historic replica of an Ozette-era longhouse. Richard Daugherty died in Pullman, Washington, on February 22, 2014, at the age of 91. He was a resident of the Panorama retirement community in Lacey, Washington, at the time. His wife, Ruth Kirk, had just completed a draft of a new book on the Ozette Indian Village a few days before his death. Bibliography =Authored and Co- Authored Books= * Daugherty, Richard D. (1956).

The purpose was to obtain control of local air strips, which could be used as forward bases by fighter aircraft for operations in central Luzon. Control of Legazpi was an important point in the Japanese strategy, as it would also give them control of San Bernardino Strait, between the islands Luzon and Samar, which would prevent the Americans from bringing in reinforcements from the south. The first invasion was at Batan Island on 8 December 1941. This was followed by Vigan, Aparri, Legazpi, Davao, and Jolo Island over the next few days Disposition of forces Legazpi, Albay is the capital of Albay Province, in far southern Luzon at the southern end of the Bicol Peninsula. The city of Legazpi was an important seaport, and the southern terminus of the Manila Railway. The area of Legazpi was in theory defended by General Wainwright's South Luzon Force with two infantry divisions, the 41st Division to the west and the 51st Division to the east. With these two divisions, Parker was expected to cover a very large geographic area with five large bays suitable for amphibious operations, and over of coastline suitable for landings. Moreover, both divisions were undermanned, poorly trained, and suffered from a serious shortage of equipment. In addition, the situation was complicated further in that the enlisted troops spoke only the local Bicol languages, whereas the officers spoke only Tagalog and English. On the Japanese side, General Homma had organized a detachment of 2500 men from the IJA 16th Division, led by Major General Naoki Kimura, with the Infantry Group HQ, 33rd Infantry Regiment and a battery from the 22nr Field Artillery Regiment. He also had a detachment of 575 men from the Kure 1st SNLF. The invasion force was supported by a large fleet from the Imperial Japanese Navy led by Rear Admiral Kyuji Kubo, consisting of the light cruiser , the destroyers , , , , , , the seaplane tenders and , two minesweepers, two patrol vessels and seven transports. Distant cover was provided by Vice Admiral Ib≈ç Takahashi with the aircraft carrier , heavy cruisers , and and the destroyer . In addition, the covering fleet was accompanied by Destroyer Squadron 2 with the light cruiser and destroyers , , , , , and , which was tasked with minelaying operations in San Bernardino Straits. Landing and aftermath The Kimura Detachment landed at Legazpi on the morning of 12 December without opposition, as the nearest American forces were over away. By 09:00 they were in control of both the airfield and the railroad. The following day, the Japanese naval covering force withdrew to Palau. The Philippine 51st Division sent an engineering battalion south into the Bicol Peninsula to destroy bridges and to prevent railroad equipment from falling into the hands of the Japanese. The first American counterattack was a strafing attack on 12 December by two fighter aircraft of the Far East Air Force on the newly captured airstrip at Legazpi, killing three Japanese. This was followed by an attack by three Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, which destroyed nine Japanese aircraft on legazpi runway. However, only one of the B-17s made it back to its base at Del Monte Airfield. Once the city of Legazpi was secure, Kimura sent his forces north on Highway 1 to capture the city of Naga, the capital of Camarines Sur Province on 18 December. Continuing north from Naga and repairing bridges as they advanced, the Japanese reached the town of Sipocot on 19 December and Daet, capital of Camarines Norte Province on 21 December. General Parker ordered two companies of the 52nd Infantry to make a stand north of Sipocot, as the Bicol Peninsula is very narrow in that area, enabling a small force to considerably delay the Japanese advance. In the early morning of 22 December, a company from the Kimura Detachment engaged the Americans. However, the 52nd Infantry had a good geographic position, and was able to push the Japanese south. However, on 23 December, the Japanese made a landing at Atimonan, the capital of Quezon Province to the north of the American positions. Although thus encircled, a portion of the 52nd Infantry managed to make its way back to American lines.  Consequences In retrospect, the advance landings by the Japanese in southern Luzon, including at Legazpi, largely accomplished its strategic objective of encircling the American forces in central Luzon, preventing both escape and reinforcement. Tactically, the air fields seized were small, and with the rapid advance of the Japanese into both central and southern Luzon, were soon unnecessary for further operations.

Preparations had already been made by the Attack on Clark Field and the landings of Japanese forces at five points in northern and southern Luzon and Mindanao in early/mid December 1941, with the IJAAF seizing air fields and basing aircraft for ground support, and the Imperial Japanese Navy establishing seaplane bases at the Camiguin Island, Legaspi, and Davao. The main landing of Japanese forces targeted Lingayen Gulf, with its proximity to the Philippine capital of Manila, and Lamon Bay on the opposite coast to the south. The Japanese order of battle The Japanese invasion force of 43,110 men was under the overall command of the IJA 14th Area Army under General Masaharu Homma. The force contained the IJA 48th Division (less the Tanaka and Kanno Detachments which had already landed in the invasions of Aparri and Vigan) under Lt General Yuitsu Tsuchihashi. A newly formed division from Taiwan, it lacked combat experience, but it was the best equipped and motorized division in the Japanese Army. It also contained elements of the IJA 16th Division including the 4th and 7th Tank Regiments with a total of between 80 and 100 tanks, and by three field artillery regiments. The invasion force sailed in three convoys, each of which constituted a separate task force with a separate landing point and objective. The Japanese maintained strict internal secrecy and only senior commanders were aware of the targets. The first task force, known as the Kamijama Detachment, consisted of the IJA 9th Infantry Regiment in 21 transports. It departed Keelung in northern Taiwan on the morning of 17 December escorted by the same fleet used in the Japanese invasion of Batan Island. The second task force with the 1st Formosa Regiment of the IJA 48th Division and 7th Tank Regiment in with 28 transports departed at noon 18 December from Mako in the Pescadores Islands. It was escorted by the same ships which previously escorted by the Vigan invasion force. The third task force had the 47th Infantry Regiment of the 48th Division and 4th Tank Regiment, departed Takao on Taiwan the evening of 18 December. It was escorted by the same ships which had previously escorted the Aparri invasion force. Distant cover was provided by the IJN 3rd Fleet under Vice Admiral Ibo Takahashi and units of Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondo‚Äôs 2nd Fleet. All three convoys arrived together at Lingayen Gulf on the night of 21 December. The landings The Takao convoy was scheduled to land at Agoo, a small village in La Union Province on the eastern shore of Lingayen Gulf beginning 0500 on 22 December. The Mako convoy was intended to start landing at 0550 hours at Caba, seven miles north of Agoo, and the Kamijima Detachment was to land at Bauang, seven miles north of Caba from 0730 hours. This was intended to give the IJA 14th Army a fifteen mile wide landing zone along the narrow coastal plain just north of the central plains of Luzon and protected from flanking counterattack from the east by the Cordillera Mountains. Once ashore, the troops were to move inland without consolidating the landing zone. The Kamijima Detachment in particular was to strike north to occupy San Fernando, and Baguio and to consolidate with the Vigan invasion force under Colonel Tanaka which was moving south along the coast. The remaining two forces were to press south past Rosario to secure the bank of the Agno River, the first major geographic obstacle on the road to Manila. However, the landing operations did not proceed smoothly as planned. Hampered by bad weather, the convoy overshot its target and anchored four miles further south than intended. Heavy seas made landing difficult and a number of landing craft were destroyed. Rather than the pinpoint landings planned, the Japanese forces found themselves spread apart over a wide area of the landing zone and unable to land the tanks and heavy equipment as planned. The American response Withdrawal in the North, December 25‚Äì31, 1941 Despite considerable advance warning of the impending invasion, American forces in the Philippines were ill-prepared. Lingayen Gulf was the most logical site for a large invasion force to land, but the entire 120 mile coast of was protected by only two Philippine Commonwealth Army divisions, of which only one had any artillery. The Americans anticipated that a landing would occur at the southern end of the gulf, which is where the Philippine 21st Division placed its artillery batteries. The northern sector was held by the Philippine 11th Division, supplemented by the 71st Division, a training division with only ten weeks of training, and the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts), which was stationed on Route 3, twelve miles to the south of Rosario. Aside from the poor weather conditions, resistance to the Japanese landing was minimal. One American submarine, S-38, managed to sink the Army transport Hayo Maru on the morning of 22 December, and sank Hayataka Maru the following day. Coastal artillery slightly damaged the auxiliary seaplane tender Sanuki Maru. Despite the fighter cover provided by the IJAAF 24th and 50th Fighter Regiments, four Boeing B-17s managed inflict some strafing damage. The only location where the Japanese faced ground opposition was at Bauang, where the Philippine 12 Infantry HQ Battalion opened fire with its one 50-caliber machine gun on the Kamijima Detachment as it landed. The Japanese advance north The Kamijima Detachment immediately moved north on Route 3 upon landing and by 1700 hours had secured the town of Bauang, with its 3rd Battalion continuing on the road toward Baguio to secure the Naguilian airfield. It was opposed by the Philippine 71st Infantry under Lt Col Donald Van N. Bonnett, who had orders to stop the Japanese advance at San Fernando. Bonnett positioned on battalion with a battery of 75-mm guns on the coastal road, and sent a second battalion on a flanking maneuver along a secondary road to the east. However, the Japanese advance was too quick for the inexperienced and poor-trained Philippine troops to get into position, and Bonnett subsequently gave orders for the division to withdraw to beyond Baguio by midnight. The Japanese advance south In the southern sector of the front, the Japanese 1st Formosa and a portion of the 48th Mountain Artillery battalions under the command of Colonel Hifumi Imai landed at Aringay by 1030 and advanced south towards Rosario along the coastal road. They were joined by 1600 by the 48th Reconnaissance and 4th Tank Regiments, which had landed at 0730 just north of Damortis. Also in the southern sector, the 47th Infantry with a battalion from the 48th Mountain Artillery under the command of Col Isamu Yanagi was also advancing towards Rosario. Their movement was opposed by a battalion of infantry of the Philippine 11th Division under Brig General William E Brougher, but after a minor skirmish, they Philippine forces were routed. Homma at this point was still unable to land his artillery and heavy equipment due to heavy seas, and therefore decided to shift his anchorage and landing points to the south. The 48th Division was ordered to take the town of San Fabian, which had two 155-mm coastal artillery guns, and the Japanese drive along the Lingayen coastline was accordingly extended further south than originally planned. The Battle of Rosario To oppose the Japanese advance on Manila, General Wainwright stationed the Philippine 26th Cavalry along the coastal road north of Rosario at the hamlet of Damortis. Receiving reports that the Japanese were advancing on bicycles and by light motor vehicles, Wainwright also dispatched a platoon of five tanks. When the 26th Cavalry encountered forward elements of the Japanese 48th Reconnaissance and 4th Tank Regiments, it fell back to the hamlet of Damoritis, where defensive positions had been established. However, with its command tank destroyed and the remaining four were damaged by Japanese 47-mm anti-tank guns, the outnumbered and outgunned 26th Cavalry withdrew, leaving Damortis under complete control of the Japanese by 1900. Rosario then became the center of American resistance. Earlier in the afternoon, Wainwright had ordered Brig General Clyde A Selleck to take the Philippine 71st Division to Damortis to hold the junction of the Rosario-Baguio road east of Rosario. However, by the time Selleck arrived at Rosario, he learned that the Japanese were advancing from both Damortis and Agoo. By evening, the survivors of the 26th Cavalry reached Rosario with the Japanese in close pursuit. At 2000, the Japanese tanks penetrated the 26th Cavalry rear guard, causing considerable casualties and it was only by blocking a bridge a few miles west of Rosario by a burning tank that the Americans managed to slow the Japanese attack and prevent a panicked rout. The center of Rosario was the scene of a pitched battle between troops of the Philippine 71st Division and a part of Colonel Yanagi‚Äôs 47th Infantry. However, fortunately for the Americans, much of Yanagi‚Äôs force had been ordered back for the capture of San Fabian, enabling the Philippine forces to escape. Thus, within one day of landing, the Japanese had secured a large section of the Lingayen Gulf coastline, and advanced north, south and east. To the north, they had joined with Colonel Tanaka‚Äôs forces from northern Luzon and to the south had occupied Rosario. The only opposition had come from the Philippine 26th Cavalry, whose poorly equipped troops and outnumbered were unable to slow the Japanese advance. The Japanese advance to the Agno River On the morning of 23 December, the Philippine 71st Division set up defensive positions along Route 3 south of Sison, with the remnants of the 26th Cavalry falling back to Pozorrubio to reorganize. The advance of the Japanese 47th Infantry was slowed until noon by the Philippine artillery, by which time the Japanese 47th had been joined by the 48th Reconnaissance and 4th Tank Regiments. Aided by aircraft, the Japanese began a concerted attack, and the Philippine 71st Division broke and fled, abandoning its artillery. At 1900 hours, the Japanese entered Sison, with the American line moved back to just north of Pozorrubio, and the 26th Cavalry continuing its retreat to Binalonan. However, the Japanese continued their attack into the night, driving the Philippine 91st Division from Pozorrubuio and ending American hopes of making a stand there. Even before the fall of Sison, Wainwright had received permission from General MacArthur to withdraw behind the Agno River as he believed that further defense of the Lingayen area was impossible. Wainwright hoped to launch a counterattack with the Philippine Division and other units being held in reserve. In the early morning of 24 December, the Japanese 4th Tank Regiment encountered the Philippine 26th Cavalry northwest of Binalonan. Although lacking anti-tank guns, the 26th Cavalry made a strong stand, inflicting considerable casualties on the Japanese, but with the arrival of the Japanese 2nd Formosa later that morning, the 26th Cavalry found itself outnumbered and almost encircled. For more than four hours, the 26th Cavalry held its ground, until the remaining 450 men began to withdraw at 1530 hours. By dusk, the survivors reached Tayung on the far side of the Agno River, and the Japanese entered Binalonan. At this point, the Japanese were in position to enter the central plain of Luzon for the final drive to Manila.  Consequences Despite adverse weather, General Homma was able to land the bulk of his forces at Lingayen Gulf with little opposition, and in a matter of a few days had secured the northern approaches to the Philippine capital of Manila.

Set in early nineteenth century England, it addresses the themes of social reform and freedom of speech in a time of war. Hester Burton received the 1963 Carnegie Medal for this novel.Carnegie Winner 1963. Carnegie Living Archive. Retrieved 27 February 2018 Setting The novel opens in 1801, when Great Britain is still at war with France. The long war has caused poverty and starvation among the lower classes in England, and the governing classes are anxious about social unrest. The book's two principal locations are Holly Lane, London, where the Pargeters have a bookshop, and Herringsby on the Suffolk coast, a seaside resort and fishing village. Plot summary The novel is a third person narrative, mainly centring on the thoughts and experiences of Margaret Pargeter. The Pargeters live on Holly Lane, near St Paul's Cathedral, where they have a bookshop. Robert Kerridge lodges with them while studying medicine. Though poor for gentlefolk, they have a comfortable life compared to many of their neighbours. The bookseller has somewhat radical views and stocks such controversial works as The Rights of Man, which Margaret often feels impelled to hide from customers. Her brother John, who does not share his father's principles, loathes the bookshop and hopes to join the army. The crisis of the novel is precipitated by a neglected tenement's collapse, which kills all the families who lived there. Inspired by the tragedy, Mr. Pargeter writes and distributes a pamphlet called The New Jerusalem in which he describes his vision of an ideal society. The rich object to his plan to hand over all property to the parishes to be administered for the good of all. He is arrested and found guilty of libelling the landlords and preaching sedition. The poor, on the other hand, object to his plan to prevent children under 14 from working, which they see as likely to make poor families poorer. While he is awaiting trial, a mob attacks his shop and burns it to the ground. Through the intercession of Robert's father and uncle, Mr. Pargeter's sentence is fairly moderate: six months in the model prison at Ipswich. Dr. Kerridge offers Margaret free lodging in the seaside resort of Herringsbury in Suffolk so that she will be able to visit her father. His hidden agenda is to separate Margaret and his son, as he believes she would be an unsuitable wife for an ambitious doctor. However, despite his family's disapproval, Robert marries Margaret as soon as he is financially independent. Drama comes to Herringsby when a riding-officer (a customs official) is found murdered. A regiment descends on the village with the intention of routing the smugglers. One of the officers of the regiment is John Pargeter, who had left London after the arrest. He makes peace with his sister and father. Mr. Pargeter plans to open a new bookshop and start a school, now believing that only through literacy and education can his dreams be realized.

The purpose was to cut off the possibility of reinforcements reaching Luzon from the south and to complete the encirclement of American forces there, with the secondary purpose of establishing a base from which the IJA 16th Army could launch an invasion of British North Borneo and the Netherlands Indies . The first invasion of the Philippines was at Batan Island on 8 December 1941. This was followed by Vigan, Aparri, Legaspi, Davao, and Jolo over the next few days Disposition of forces Davao City is the economic center of southern Mindanao, and before the start of the war was the hub of Japanese settlement and economic activity in the Philippines. For the invasion of Davao, Major General Shizuo Sakaguchi IJA 56th Division organized two detachments totaling 5000 men. The Miura Detachment, led by Lt Col Toshio Miura consisted of the 1st Battalion of the 33rd Infantry Regiment, and the Sakaguchi Detachment, led by Sakaguchi himself, consisted of the 146th Infantry Regiment, as well as an armored and an artillery battalion. Whereas the IJA 14th Army was in charge of the invasion of the Philippines, Sakaguchi‚Äôs forces were under the IJA 16th Army and were scheduled to continue to advance south to Tarakan in the Netherlands Indies via Jolo in the Sulu islands after Davao was secured. For the Jolo portion of the mission, Sakaguchi was to be assisted by the Kure SNLF, who has just completed their mission to secure Legaspi. The area of Davao was in theory defended by 2000 men of the Philippine Commonwealth Army‚Äôs 101st Infantry Regiment, let by Lt Col Roger B Hilsman. As with other units in the Philippine Army, the force was only partially trained, and suffered from a serious shortage of equipment. Davao was of concern to the Imperial Japanese Navy, as it had an American naval base and was only 500 miles from the major Japanese military center in the western Pacific, Palau. However, at the start of the war, only the seaplane tender , with three operational Consolidated PBYs was in the harbor. Unaware of this, on 8 December the Japanese launched an attack on Davao, with 13 dive bombers and 9 fighters launched from the aircraft carrier , with the destroyers , , and making a high speed run for the entrance to Davao harbor to catch any escaping vessels. The raid was somewhat of a fiasco, as the Japanese pilots did not even recognize William B. Preston as a warship and only managed to destroy two of her PBYs (the other was away on a mission at the time). Landing and aftermath The fight for Mindanao 29 April ‚Äì 9 May 1942 The Japanese invasion force under the overall command of admiral Raizo Tanaka departed Palau on 17 December in 5 transports, escorted by the light cruiser and six destroyers (, , , , and ), with the aircraft carrier Ry≈´j≈ç and the seaplane carrier , and the cruisers , and providing distant cover. On the afternoon of 19 December, Ry≈´j≈ç launched aircraft to destroy the radio station at Cape San Augustin, and the Chitose launched reconnaissance aircraft, which flew over Davao. The Japanese transports arrived at Davao by midnight, and landing commenced from 0400 hours, with the Miura Detachment landing to the north, and the Sakaguchi Detachment landing to the southwest of the city. The only opposition was a single machine gun squad, which attacked the Miura Detachment before it was destroyed by a direct hit by a shell fired from a Japanese destroyer. However, since the Miura Detachment suffered casualties, Sakaguchi was forced to commit reserve forces he was holding back for the Jolo portion of the operation. By 1030, Col Hilsmen pulled his men out of the city northwest into the hills. By 1500 hours, the city and airfield were in Japanese hands, and by evening a seaplane base was established to the south of the urban area. On 20 December, as Sakaguchi was reorganizing his forces into nine transports for the landing on Jolo Island, he was attacked by a force of nine USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers which had launched from Darwin, Australia. Visibility was poor, and the bombers caused little damage. The Jolo invasion force departed Davao of 23 December, reaching its destination on the afternoon 24 December. Jolo, the capital of the former Sultanate of Sulu, was defended by only 300 members of the Philippine Constabulary. The Japanese landed on the morning of 25 December with no resistance.  Consequences The advance landings by the Japanese in southern Mindanao and the Sulu island has little to no impact on the overall campaign in the Philippines, but placed the Japanese in a good position for the planned invasion of Borneo and the Netherlands East Indies in early 1942.

Meaning Chanchala (Sanskrit: ‡§ö‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§≤) means - 'inconsiderate', 'nimble', 'shaking', 'inconstant', 'moveable', 'flickering', 'moving', 'unsteady', 'fortune', 'wind', 'long pepper', In literature Chanchala is the good word for 'vacillation' in Sanskrit language; in Sanskrit literature Sanskritpoetry the girl with the dancing eyes is called chanchalakshi, which is considered to be rare attribute. However, as part of the literary evidence of Kusana period, the word Chanchala, like Dhavani and Rodini, indicates the nature or action of Mother goddess. In the Bhagavad Gita(Sloka VI.26): :‡§Ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§≤‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§§‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§§‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ ‡§µ‡§Ç‡§∂ ‡§®‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡•ç  the word Chanchala used in the first line refers to the restless and the unsteady mind that wanders away. Dasam Granth, which like the Guru Granth Sahib is an important book of Sikhism, it is not composed in ragas (its first composition dates 1684 A.D.) tells us that Chanchala is the name a chhand or metre of sixteen syllables having ragan, jagan, ragan, jagan and laghu consecutively in each quarter, this metre is also known as Chitra, Biraj and Brahmrupak, and has been used twice in Choubis Autar. In theology Chanchala, meaning, 'the fickle-fortune', is one of the many names of Lakshmi. There is no mention of Lakshmi in the Rig Veda. Sri of the Rig Veda is deified as a personified being in the Yajurveda, and in the Atharvaveda (I.18) she is prayed to secure prosperity. Jatavedas Agni is repeatedly asked to make the goddess come to the votary; the epithet anapagamini reflects the chanchala i.e. fleet or fickle aspect of the goddess. Lakshmi or Chanchala as the mobile one associates only with the rich and the dynamic, no matter what their caste, creed or colour. Because Lakshmi is chanchala i.e. quick on her feet, to make her achala i.e. 'immobile', she needs to be worshipped quietly so that she does not get distracted. In yoga In Yoga, vritti indicates the contents of mental awareness that are disturbances in the medium of consciousness. The vrittis of the gunas are ever-active and swift, the gunas serve as parts of buddhi, their habitual conduct is fickle, restless, tremulous (chanchala) activity, which activity can be controlled through Abhyasa, Vairagya and Ishvarapranidhana. Sri Narada Pancharatnam (Sloka VIII.15) tells us that Chanchala is the nadi which along with Medhya resides in the Visuddha Chakra on the throat.

Plans and studies have been in the works for high-speed rail (HSR) in Indonesia around for many years. However, it was not until 2008 that it was contemplated seriously. The new plan to finally start HSR construction was announced by Indonesian Government in July 2015, after President of China and world leaders visited Bandung Conference. Plans were also mentioned for a possible extension of the HSR to Surabaya in East Java . Indonesia already has a conventional railway network. History and development Japan International Cooperation Agency's proposal initiated the idea to build high-speed rail for the Indonesian island of Java, linking up the capital Jakarta to Surabaya city (covering 730 km) in East Java. Both Japan and China had expressed their interest in the high speed rail projects in Indonesia. Previously, both countries had carried out comprehensive studies for a project for the Jakarta‚ÄìBandung section (142.3 km). Only the Japanese agency, JICA, had issued a study for a project extending to Surabaya (730 km). The Indonesian HSR bid marked rivalry between Japan and China in their competition for Asian infrastructure projects. On late September 2015, Indonesia awarded the rail project to China, much to Japan's disappointment. It was said that China's offer to build the Jakarta‚ÄìBandung line without requiring an official loan guarantee nor funding from Indonesia was the tipping point of Jakarta's decision. In January 2016, Transportation Minister released a route permitKeputusan Menteri Perhubungan Nomor KP. 25 Tahun 2016 tentang Penetapan Trase Jalur Kereta Api Cepat antara Jakarta dan Bandung Lintas Halim-Tegalluar. for a high speed railway between Jakarta and Bandung (142.3 kilometers) with stations located at Halim (Jakarta end), Karawang, Walini, and Tegalluar (Bandung end) and also Tegalluar depot. 71.63 km of the track will be at ground level, 53.54 km will be elevated, and 15.63 km will be underground. The better departure point at the Jakarta end would be the inner city railway station of Gambir but because construction of the Gambir-Halim leg was seen as adding complications, the link will only be from Halim (Jakarta) to Tegalluar (Bandung) with a cost of $5.135 million. Concession period is 50 years from May 31, 2019 and cannot be prolonged, except in a force majeure situation. Groundbreaking has been done on January 21, 2016. The HSR is project of 60 percent of Indonesian consortium and 40 percent of China Railway International. The Jakarta‚ÄìBandung high-speed rail is planned to begin its operations to public in 2019 The Japanese proposal can start operation only by 2023. The section Bandung-Surabaya, though a priority section due to heavy congestion, has been officially shelved for budget reasons since early 2015. In October 2016, the Indonesian government announced its intention to build a 600 km medium-high speed railway between Jakarta and Surabaya, and invited Japan to participate in this project. =Japan's proposal= Shinkansen E5 series proposed by Japan Since 2008, Japan has been long-nurtured the plan to export their Shinkansen high-speed railway technology to Indonesia. During Indonesia-Japan Friendship Festival in November 2008, Japan has showcased their Shinkansen technology to impress Indonesian audiences. In 2009, a Japanese government-sponsored feasibility study was conducted for the planning of project ‚Äì a high speed (300 km/hr) rail line extending 730 kilometers across the island of Java from Jakarta to Surabaya. The idea of high-speed rail backed by funding (soft loans) has been proposed by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the Indonesian island of Java, linking up the densely populated corridor from the capital Jakarta to Surabaya (730 km). The island, similar in many respects to pre-HSR Honshu, suffers greatly from both freight and passenger congestion. The idea has been around for some years, however, a new proposal to divide the project into stages has emerged, with the first stage from Jakarta to Bandung, 150 km to 35 minutes, from current conventional train time of 3 hours at a price of 50 trillion rupiah. The JICA detailed feasibility study was finished in 2014, following up on an initial study in 2012. By 2013 Indonesia has been undergoing a revival in railway expansion and upgrades in recent years. High- speed corridors have been proposed but not implemented. Japan ‚Äì with its reputation as a world-class train-maker ‚Äì seemed destined to win the contract. However, in 2014 Indonesian government changes, as Joko Widodo swore as a new president in October 2014. In January 2015 the Joko administration essentially stopped preparations for the high-speed rail project, citing that the high- speed rail project is too costly and there are more pressing infrastructure needs in outlying underdeveloped islands outside of Java. Japanese domination in high-speed rail project seemed to be unchallenged. However, that was until April 2015 when China had entered the race with a counter-offer. In March 2015, Joko Widodo traveled to Tokyo and Beijing. In Tokyo March 22‚Äì25 Joko Widodo met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Widodo got a commitment for Japanese loan support for improving Jakarta's municipal rail network, but no progress was made on resolving issues with the Jakarta‚ÄìBandung high-speed rail project. =China's bid= CR400AF proposed by China. In April 2015, China submitted a bid for the Indonesian high-speed rail project ‚Äì much to Japan's dismay. On March 26, 2015, Joko Widodo visited Beijing and met China's paramount leader Xi Jinping. Xi publicly announced support for the Indonesian high-speed project and the two governments signed a memorandum specifying China's interest in the Jakarta‚ÄìBandung line. In July 2015, Indonesian government exposed their plan to build the high-speed rail connecting Jakarta and Bandung, and arranged a contest between Japan and China train-makers as potential bidders. China responded by launching a Chinese High-speed Rail Technology exhibition in Senayan City shopping mall in Jakarta in August 2015. Both China and Japan have engaged in a fierce competition through intense lobbying. It was said that the fundamental reason for the high level of assertiveness demonstrated by both Japan and China goes well beyond just economics ‚Äì this contest is part of a much larger chess game the two Asian powerhouses are playing in pursuit of greater strategic influence within the Asia Pacific. =Short cancellation= President Joko Widodo was expected to announce the winning bid of Indonesia's first high-speed rail project in early September 2015. However, to everyone's surprise, on 3 September 2015 the Indonesian government announced that they had cancelled the high-speed rail project, citing that they are now looking to the slower and cheaper rail alternative. It was said that the government turns to semi-high-speed rail. President Joko Widodo is wishing for a \\"business-to-business\\" approach, as opposed to \\"government-to-government\\" approach. Which signify government unwillingness to partially fund nor financially guarantee this costly project. After the cancellation, it seems that China secretly reapproaches Indonesia with a new offer, while Japan failed to do so. =Bid winner= In mid- September 2015, China said they would fully meet the Indonesian government's demands and offering new proposal that does not require Indonesia to assume any fiscal burden or debt guarantee in proceeding with the project. After months of bids, revisions and talks among presidents and prime ministers ‚Äì even a short-lived cancellation of the project ‚Äì in late September 2015 Indonesia picked China for the $5 billion project. It seems that Beijing has outmanoeuvred Tokyo on this bid as a result of a competitive financing package for Indonesia. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga termed the Indonesian move \\"difficult to understand\\" and \\"extremely regrettable\\". The situation \\"can only be described as extremely deplorable,\\" Suga also said. According to Indonesia's State-Owned Enterprises Minister Rini Soemarno, Chinese bid was picked due to its financial structure ‚Äì because the Chinese had not required any Indonesian government financing or a government guarantee, unlike the Japanese plan. China's victory over Japan in this bid seems to owe mainly to Chinese willingness to accept the financial risk of the project. Which is to forego an Indonesian government guarantee and also, thereby, possibly to finesse international ODA norms, in contrast of Japan's inability or unwillingness to do so. China has also sweetened its deal in other ways, including committing to establish a joint venture with Indonesian firms to produce rolling stock for high-speed rail, electric rail, light rail systems, not only for Indonesia, but also for export to other Asian countries ‚Äì to transfer related technology ‚Äì and to renovate and rebuild train stations. It seems that Indonesia has benefitted from Japan-China competition. =Controversy= On April 2016, five Chinese high-speed rail project workers were arrested in Halim Perdanakusuma Airbase. This incident highlighted the refusal of Indonesian Air Force to give up lands belonging to the Halim Perdanakusuma airbase in East Jakarta. It was reported that one of the railway stations would be located on land currently within Halim airbase. In February 2018, Onan Hiroshi, a Japanese cartoonist described Indonesian President Joko Widodo as a \\"High-speed rail beggar\\" in relation with the stagnant Chinese high-speed rail project in Indonesia, and accused Indonesia to have requested Japan's assistance in completing the project. The cartoon quickly drew protest from Indonesian internet users, and by 25 February, the cartoonist tweeted an apology, removed the drawings and closed the page.

On Friday, 16 October 2015, Chinese and Indonesian state-owned companies officially signed the deal to build the first high-speed railway in Indonesia. The project cost was estimated to be US$5.5 billion (80 trillion rupiah). The deal was signed by China Railway International Co. Ltd. Chairman Yang Zhongmin and Dwi Windarto, the president director of a consortium of Indonesian state companies, PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN Indonesia. China Development Bank has given a commitment to fund 75 percent of the project costs with loan terms of 40 years for the loan‚Äîwith an initial grace period of 10 years‚Äîwith fixed loan rate. CRCC will hold majority shares in the planned JV company, while WIKA holds 30 percent and small portions for local toll operator PT Jasa Marga Tbk (IDX: JSMR), train operator PT Kereta Api Indonesia and plantation company PT Perkebunan Nusantara VIII. In late August 2016, it was reported that the China Development Bank had not yet disbursed funds for the loan and that PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia-China, the consortium executing the project, was not sure when funds would become available.\\"High-Speed Train Held Up by Chinese Credit\\",Tempo, 4 September 2016. =Progress= 2016 * January Indonesian president Joko Widodo attended a ground breaking ceremony near Jakarta and announced that the project had commenced. * May Continual delays in acquiring land were being reported. The president of the Indonesian joint venture firm managing the project, PT KCIC (Kereta Cepat Indonesia China), Hanggoro Budi Wiryawan, expressed frustration at the Dept of Transport requirement that all of the land needed for the project (estimated to be 600 ha) be acquired before final construction permits could be issued. Hanggoro argued that it was more usual for construction permits to be issued when just 10% of the required land for a project had been acquired. He said that the delays in the Dept of Transport were unreasonable. Issues surrounding acquisition of land were complicated by the fact that the main station at the Jakarta end was planned to be on land occupied by the Indonesian Air Force at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport. It was not clear whether the Air Force was prepared to release the land. * August The Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, Rini Soemarno, said that the process of issuing permits for the project was running smoothly after earlier delays. She said that she believed that construction on the railway could start within a week. * November 82 percent of land needed has been acquired, but bank funding will only be attainable after 100 percent land is acquired. 2017 * March The project is stalled due to land, finance and security issues. Among others is the Indonesian Air Force reluctance to release 49 hectares of the lands surrounding Halim Perdanakusuma Airbase on the southeastern outskirts of Jakarta for the construction of the station. * April PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia Cina (KCIC) and High-Speed Railway Contractor Consortium (KSRCC) signed an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract on the Jakarta ‚Äì Bandung bullet train on April 4, 2017. Contractors will proceed with construction following the contract signing. 2018 *January The Jakarta Post referred to the project as \\"stagnant\\" and Maritime Affairs Coordinating Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan announced that a review would be conducted to consider whether a high-speed rail system really was needed between Jakarta and Bandung because \\"the cities are only 140 kilometers apart.\\"'Indonesia to review Jakarta-Bandung railway project', The Jakarta Post, 10 January 2018. *March It was reported that government agencies (the National Land Agency and the Agrarian and Spatial Planning Ministry) suspected that there had been maladministration in the acquisition of over 1,800 plots of land for the project. As a result, approval of permits for the use of land for the project had been delayed.'Jakarta-Bandung railway project stuck in land acquisition stage', The Jakarta Post, 16 March 2018. *April State-owned enterprises minister Rini Soemarno, on a visit to Beijing, said that project construction would start in the coming month, May, and that she hoped that perhaps construction could start even sooner. She also said that she hoped land acquisition could be completed by the end of May.'Construction of high-speed railway starts in May: Minister', The Jakarta Post, 5 April 2018. *July Three lawsuits received legal approval from the courts to proceed with claims seeking compensation for their properties affected by the project. Meanwhile, the developer of the project PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia-China said that the progress of the project would not be affected by the lawsuits.

Ridwan Kamil hoped to commence the high speed rail operation in 2021. *September The construction progress reached 32.8% and land acquisition progress reached 99.0%. *October Construction progress 38.2%. 2020 In mid-February 2020, construction progress reached 44 percent and land acquisitions reach 99.96 percent. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work of the project has been halted temporarily, resulting in the delay of the targeted finish of construction and start of the operation. Three months later, construction progress reached 48.3 percent and the construction works resumed, which follow government's health and safety measures, such as social/physical distancing in response to the pandemic. In September, Director of KCIC Xin Xuezhong stated that construction progress reached 60 percent and land acquisitions reached 100 percent. Jakarta‚ÄìSurabaya In March 2017, Indonesian Government selected Japan as the partner for the revitalization of the railway connecting Jakarta and Surabaya. The project aims to upgrade the speed of trains between two major Indonesian cities to higher-speed rail with operating speeds of between 140 and 160 kilometers per hour (km/h). Construction will eradicate level grade crossings and/or constructing elevated railways. Currently, there are around 988 level grade crossings between Jakarta and Surabaya, which hinder the security, intensity and the speed of trains. The project phase-1 will run on a new railtrack from Jakarta to Semarang, whereas the phase-2 will run on upgrade the existing railtrack from Semarang to Surabaya. Japan, which previously lost to China to be associated with the high-speed railway connecting Jakarta and Bandung is the partner in this project. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had joined the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology in conducting a feasibility study of the project.

In February 1929, the church was consecrated by the Archbishop of Winnipeg, Arthur Sinnott. In 1946, the population within the parish had grown to such an extent, that Our Lady of Victory Memorial parish was created from St Ignatius'. In 1957, another parish, St John Brebeuf was also created from St Ignatius'. Masses were originally held in the gymnasium of St John Brebeuf School until the church was built in 1965. Parish The church hosts six Sunday Masses. From October to June 30 they are at 5:00pm on Saturday evening; 8:00am, 9:30am and 11:00am on Sunday morning; at 3:40pm on Sunday afternoon for a Spanish language Mass and at 8:30 pm on Sunday evening. From July 1 to September 30 there are only two Sunday morning Masses 9:00am and 11:00am, the rest of the Masses remaining at the same times except for Sunday evening Mass which is at 9:00pm. There is a weekday Mass at 7:15 am on Monday (and an 11:00am Lay Service) and 11:00am Masses from Tuesday to Saturday.Parishes from Archdiocese of Winnipeg retrieved 18 March 2014 The church has a relationship with St Ignatius School. The school was continually expanded in the 20th-century and after a fire in 2007, was rebuilt. It was staffed by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary from their main school in Winnipeg St. Mary's Academy until the early 1990s.  Music ministry  Between 1969 and June 2013 folk- rock-jazz music group Discernment performed at the 9 pm Sunday Mass. The group was formed by Rita Doerr (vocals) at the age of 14 in 1969 while attending St. Mary's Academy. Jeff Doerr (keyboard), Eileen Grant-MacLeod (vocals), Dan Leonhardt (drums), Daryl Torchia (bass guitar) and Keith Macpherson (vocals, guitar) as well as others, joined the group. The music was so well done that it attracted young people from all over metro Winnipeg.

She received the Carnegie Medal for her 1963 novel Time of Trial, which like many of her books was illustrated by Victor Ambrus.Time of Trial at WorldCat. Early life Flood waters at Erith, 1953 which killed 41 people in Suffolk and inspired Burton's novel The Great Gale. She was born Hester Wood-Hill on 6 December 1913, in Beccles, Suffolk, where her father was elected town Mayor three times. From 1925 to 1936, she attended Headington School, Oxford and then St Anne's College, Oxford, where she received an honours degree in English. In 1937, she married Reginald W. B. Burton, a Classics don at Oriel College. They had three daughters. Non-fiction In 1949, Burton published a biography of Barbara Bodichon, the 19th-century feminist, artist and educationalist. She worked for Oxford University Press from 1956 to 1964, contributing two volumes to the Oxford Sheldonian English Series for secondary schoolchildren: Coleridge and the Wordsworths, 1953,Coleridge and the Wordsworths at WorldCat. and Tennyson in 1954.Tennyson at WorldCat. She worked as an assistant editor for the revised Oxford Junior Encyclopaedia, and edited two 1959 anthologies: A Book of Modern StoriesA Book of Modern Stories at WorldCat. and Her First Ball.Her First Ball at WorldCat. In addition, Burton edited works by friends and colleagues, including Thomas Hardy: Distracted Preacher? Hardy's Religious Biography and its Influence on his Novels by Timothy R. Hands and Mike Esbester. Fiction Her first children's novel was The Great Gale, published in 1960 and inspired by the devastation inflicted by the North Sea flood of 1953 on her home county of Suffolk. Her subject matter often reflected a radical approach first popularised by Geoffrey Trease. It included the slave trade in To Ravensrigg and the Captain Swing riots of the 1830s in No Beat of Drum and Otmoor for Ever. She sometimes covered similar themes for different age groups; Beyond the Weir Bridge was written for teens, while the same issues and events appear in Through the Fire, aimed at six-to-nine year olds. Several of her books are set in Suffolk, with many also having a maritime or naval setting.\\"Hester Burton\\" at Fantastic Fiction. Rather than seeking to balance diverging views, Burton presented her stories from the perspectives of an individual or group of individuals, which she viewed as more authentic. In a 1973 interview, she explained this as follows: \\"I am not all-wise or all- knowing... but neither were the people actually taking part.... It is a wise precaution for a writer of historical fiction to limit this range of vision... [and] also much better art.\\" Many of her books, including No Beat of Drum and A Time of Trial, reflect the impact of inequalities in society on her protagonists, their willingness to challenge these and the importance of education in that process. As shown by her biography of Victorian feminist Barbara Bodichon, Burton had an abiding interest in women's issues; her novels portrayed strong and independent heroines, with many of Ambrus' cover illustrations emphasising the female character. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature summarises her novels as \\"featuring heroines with strong opinions; class tensions and social justice are recurring themes. Her writing is unsentimental... and her books accounts of ordinary young people affected by national events.\\" In a letter written in February, 2006, one of Burton's daughters wrote; \\"I could always tell when Mum had another book on her mind, she would start to cook the meal while still wearing her overcoat and hat. Death Hester Burton died on 17 September 2000 in Oxford, after a stroke suffered at the age of 86.

History  Trolley with Braugold advertising in Erfurt The history of Braugold Brewery goes back to two breweries formed in the 19th century. Originally, two farm breweries were bought on the downtown street Gro√üe Arche in the years 1822 and 1827 by Volkmar D√∂ppleb . These were middle- class houses with agricultural land ownership right to brew beer . The consolidated brewery later went to a Baumann family, which also bought the brewery Schedel in 1848. The second line was founded by Christian Buchner in 1823 by buying the brewery Lauenburg. Under his leadership, the brewery moved in 1888 to its new location in L√∂bervorstadt near Erfurt's city parks. In 1920 the brewery acquired Baumann Buchner AG. At the same time the brewery merged with Leipzig Riebeck Brauerei AG, founded by Carl Adolf Riebeck. In 1921 the reorganized brewery produced 2.5 million gallons of beer. After the end of World War II, the brewery was transferred to public ownership in 1948. With the entry of the trademark Braugold the brewery in 1956 received its current name. In 1967, the production of today's best-selling beer brewing Pilsner special gold began. 1969 was formed by the merger of nine breweries in the district of Erfurt VEB Kombinat drinks Erfurt. The Braugold brewery was the parent company and seat of the line of the combine . After the turn and the associated end of the beverages combine the Braugold brewery was first adopted by the Lich private brewery in 1990. In 1996 it was taken over by the successor to the former owner, the Riebeck group, which included at that time the brewery in Eisenach and the Wernesgr√ºner brewery. On 1 January 2011 took over the beverage group Forest Hoff Braugold Brewery.Meldung auf der Homepage der OTZ vom 22.

The controversy around his sole possession after his death led to the establishment of A. Riebeck‚Äôsche Montanwerke by his heirs.  Personal life  Riebeck was born into a mining family from Clausthal. In 1827, his father, Steiger, a mine surveyor's assistant, moved with his family to Harzgerode to work in the Lower Harz ironstone mines in Anhalt. In 1847, Riebeck married Maria Renk ( 1825-1873 ). From this marriage 7 children were born, of which three survived to adulthood. Of these 7 children, only two were sons, Emil Riebeck and Paul Riebeck. His daughter Margaret (1864-1904) married General Reinhard Gottlob Georg Heinrich Freiherr von Scheffer-Boyadel, who was knighted in 1890. His daughter Maria married geoscientist Herbert Credner in 1872. In 1877, Riebeck married his second wife, Emilie Balthasar, producing two children. His grave is located on the Halle Stadtgottesacker.  Career  Riebeck eventually left school to begin working in 1835 as a pit boy and later as Lehrh√§uer in Harzgerode's Albertine ironstone mine. At the age of 18, he left the Harz mountains to work in the brown coal mines of Zeitz and Weissenfels. He attended a mining school in Eisleben and qualified to become a mining foreman. After an accident, Riebeck was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for criminal breach of duty, which he served between 1848 and 1849. After his release, he found a job at S√§chsisch-Th√ºringischen Aktiengesellschaft, that excavated brown coal. In 1856 he was promoted to the post of mining inspector. He resigned in 1858 after realizing that he would not be considered for a higher position. He bought brown coal mines in the area of Bitterfeld und Wei√üenfels and soon began mining operations. Riebeck borrowed money to invest in the upgrade of coal technology as well as distillation units for the production of paraffin, mineral oil and tar. The petroleum factories of Gosserau, Webau, Reu√üen bei Thei√üen and Oberr√∂blingen became the foundation of Riebeck's empire. Within a few years, Riebeck acquired refining plants and briquette factories in Hall, Schwelereien, Whiterock and Bitterfeld. He developed brown coal mining into a large scale industry within Saxony and Thuringia. Riebeck later became the wealthiest citizen of Halle, operating the Riebecksche brewery, Leipziger Brauhaus zu Reudnitz, in the Saxon Reudnitz and some manors. Even before social legislation was created, he provided social security measures for his workers. =References= * Hermann Krey: Carl Adolph Riebeck. In: Mitteldeutsche Lebensbilder, 1.

Dazley was suspected, but not tried, in the poisoning of her first husband Simeon Mead and their son Jonah Mead in 1840. The murder of William Dazley took place in Wrestlingworth, England. Early life Born in 1819 in the town of Potton, Bedfordshire, Sarah Reynolds was the daughter of the town barber Philip Reynolds and his wife Ann Reynolds.Glimpses into the 19th Century Broadside Ballad Trade At the age of 7, Dazley's father died and her mother went on to court a series of men. Dazley, who was tall with long auburn hair and big brown eyes, married at the age of 19 to Simeon Mead. They lived in the town of Potton for two years before moving to Tadlow in 1840. Shortly after the move, she gave birth to their son Jonah. Jonah became ill and died at the age of seven months. In October 1840, Simeon Mead died unexpectedly as well. Murders Soon after the death of her first husband, Dazley married her second, and final, husband William Dazley in 1841. Once married they moved to the village of Wrestlingworth. Dazley invited teenage Ann Mead, Simeon Mead's daughter, to live with her and her new husband. William Dazley was opposed to the idea of Mead living with them, so in retaliation he became an avid drinker and beat Dazley. She went on to tell one of her friends, William Waldock, that she would kill a man who ever hit her. William Dazley grew ill and his wife along with Ann Mead began taking care of him. The local doctor, Dr. Sandell, gave William prescriptions that helped him show signs of recovery while under the care of Ann Mead.Sarah Dazley ‚Äì a Victorian poisoner After seeing this, Dazley started making pills of her own for her husband. Mead didn't notice this as a problem at first. When William refused to take the new pills, Ann took one herself to show him there was nothing wrong. She was not aware that these pills contained arsenic trioxide that Sarah had intentionally added. Once Sarah saw Mead take the pill she scolded her for it. After taking it, Mead became ill and shared similar symptoms with William, vomiting and stomach pains. William eventually decided to take his wife's lethal drugs and died on 30 October 1842. After his death, suspicion rose against Dazley and the deaths of her two husbands and son. William Dazley's body was exhumed and found to contain traces of arsenic. An arrest warrant was then issued for Dazley, who fled to London. Conviction After being discovered in London by the Superintendent of Blunden Biggleswade Police, Dazley insisted she was innocent of any crimes. She claimed she had no idea about any poisonings and never got a hold of poisons or anything of that nature. She was arrested and returned to Bedford. Since the news of William Dazley's death had caused suspicion regarding the deaths of Jonah and Simeon Mead as well, their bodies were also exhumed. Traces of arsenic were found in Jonah, but Simeon's body was too decomposed to test. Sarah Dazley was committed to Bedford Gaol on 24 March 1843 and awaited her trial. Meanwhile, she used this time to provide defenses such as William poisoned himself, or he poisoned Jonah and Simeon, so she poisoned William as revenge for murdering her family out of his desires for Dazley herself. On 22 July 1843 Sarah Dazley was tried for the murder of William Dazley at Bedfordshire Summer Assizes. She was not tried for the murder of her son Jonah, but the case was kept if the first case against her were to fail. The chemists she bought arsenic from were able to testify against her, as well as Ann Mead and neighbor Mrs. Carver. They told the court what they had seen, including the pill making. William Waldock testified against Dazley about her statement that she would kill any man that hit her, after making claims that William Dazley had hit her. The Marsh test was used to detect the arsenic in William Dazley's body and the result was used as forensic evidence against Dazley. It only took 30 minutes for the jury to convict Dazley for the murder of her second husband. Death Judge Baron Alderson sentenced Sarah Dazley to hanging. She was executed on Saturday, 5 August 1843, at Bedford Gaol. She was the only woman to be publicly hanged at Bedford Gaol, as well as the last person to be hanged there overall. Thousands of people came to watch the execution, and she became known as the Potton Poisoner.

Nanny Lambrecht attended a workshop for teachers in Xanten on the Lower Rhine, and completed her training in Belgium in order to learn French. In 1889, she was hired at the bilingual school in Malmedy in the former Prussian Rhine province, where she practiced for 13 years. She began to write and publish her stories. In Malmedy she met her Walloon life companion, Fanny Bierens. From some remarks in letters that suggest a romantic relationship, folklorist Susanne Hose concludes that it \\"was more than just one of convenience between unmarried women.\\" They left Malmedy in 1904 and lived in Aachen. Lambrecht established herself as a freelance writer on the growing Catholic book and magazine market. After World War I, Lambrecht moved from occupied Aachen to Bad Honnef, where she founded a literary and musical society. She published many novels and short stories, the last a 1936 novel which contained some concessions to Nazi ideology. She died in 1942, the year she retired. Works and reception After the release of her collection of short stories \\"What Happened in the Fens ...\\" (1904) and the Eifel novel The House in the Moor (1906), literature reviews described Lambrecht as the \\"Catholic Viebig\\", after German author Clara Viebig. Lambrecht considered this label inappropriate and offensive. False rumors had claimed that Clara Viebig's novel Das Weiberdorf, also situated in the Eifel region, had been banned by the Catholic Church.Lange, Sophie: \\"Clara Viebig stand nicht auf dem Index: 'Die katholische Kirche ist sehr b√∂se auf mich'\\"; in: Eifel-Jahrbuch 2008, pp. 108‚Äì113; quoted from Clara Viebig Gesellschaft, Sekund√§rliteratur Lambrecht's novel The Statue Lady (1908) takes place in Malmedy and the surrounding villages of the former Prussian Wallonia. In this work, she addresses the German government's actions to Germanize the Walloon minority. At the same time, it deals with issues of women's emancipation. The focus of Lambrecht's novel Arms√ºnderin (1909), set in the Hunsr√ºck settlement of Scheidbach, is a young woman from a family of tinkers who is pregnant by the son of a wealthy farmer and, rejected by all the villagers, brings her illegitimate child into the world in a quarry. The topic of single motherhood, as well as issues of birth control and abortion addressed in Notwehr, the Novel of the Unborn (1911), were continually discussed at the beginning of the 20th century. Following the publication of Arms√ºnderin the latent \\"Catholic literature dispute\\", part of a larger controversy surrounding the position of Catholics in the Protestant-dominated German Empire, flared up again. A reprint of the novel in the reform-oriented Catholic magazine Hochland by the publisher Karl Muth angered the conservative Ultramontanes. As a result, Lambrecht was excluded from the Catholic book market. The themes of commitment for the socially weak and advocacy for the emancipation of women run through all of Lambrecht's works. With a strong regional focus and long dialect passages, she was closely related to the literary folk art movement. During World War I, she published several novels about war. In the 1920s she focused on historical novels and entertainment. Bibliography * What Happened in the Fens ...

Signing the pledge, created in early July, was a requirement to receive any support from the organization. Signing the pledge entailed supporting a monogamous heterosexual definition of marriage, as well as backing a ban on pornography, abortion, and Sharia Law. Notable signees include Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum, while the pledge drew notable criticism from libertarian candidate Gary Johnson.  Contents  The vow begins with a series of preambles, each designed to show the \\"great crisis\\" in the institution of marriage. Later, the first preamble, one that claimed that children of slaves were more likely to live in 2 parent households than children are today, was redacted due to the criticism it received. The following are the vows the candidates pledged to by signing. * Personal fidelity to their spouse * Respect for the marital bonds of others * Fidelity to the US constitution * Support for \\"faithful constitutionalists\\" as judges * Opposition to any redefinition of marriage that falls outside of heterosexual monogamous relationships * \\"Recognition of the overwhelming statistical evidence that married people enjoy better health, better sex, longer lives, greater financial stability, and that children raised by a mother and a father together experience better learning, less addiction, less legal trouble, and less extramarital pregnancy\\" * Reform of anti marriage portions of welfare policy * Extended \\"cooling off\\" periods for those seeking a divorce * Legal advocacy for the Defense of Marriage Act * Support for a federal marriage amendment to the US constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman * Opposition to human trafficking, sexual slavery, prostitution, * Prevention of seduction into promiscuity * Opposition to pornography. Although Plaats later clarified that the pledge just intended to prevent women from being coerced into pornography. * Opposition to abortion and infanticide * Supporting safeguards to prevent sexual abuse in the military * Opposition to women serving in active combat roles in the military * Rejection of Sharia Islam * Rejection of all forms of anti-women totalitarian control * Recognition that childbearing is beneficial to \\"U.S. demographic, economic, strategic and actuarial health and security.\\" * Commitment to downsizing the government * Defense of religious liberty and freedom of speech.  Response  = Criticism =  Claims of racism  One of the preambles to the pledge, drew massive amounts of criticism for claiming that children of slaves were more likely to live in a 2 parent household. \\"Slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American President.\\" Several days later, Plaats sent out an email clarifying that \\"Our critics are distorting the facts and misrepresenting The Marriage Vow. The preamble to the vow references relevant and sobering data which points to marriages and families being in crisis. The FAMiLY LEADER has never made the claim, nor ever will, that slavery was better for families.\\" The preamble was later removed from the pledge.  Gary Johnson  On July 19, Gary Johnson published an article in the Huffington Post criticizing The Marriage Vow. He claimed that the pledge endorsed government intervention into the personal lives of citizens, while criticizing the discriminatory language of the pledge. He went on to state that Pledge's focus on social issues redirected attention from areas like the economy.  Other criticisms  House Speaker Pro-Tem Jeff Kaufmann said the pledge had \\"ridiculous implications\\", refused to sign, and told Plaats that his \\"integrity is in question\\" and \\"political credibility is waning to the point of no impact.\\" Former Iowa State Senator Jeff Angelo said \\"This pledge is an attempt to shut down dialogue between voters and the people vying to represent them.\\". Presidential candidate Mitt Romney called the pledge \\"undignified and inappropriate.\\" Romney's campaign later clarified that he would not sign because preamble suggesting children of slaves were better off than today. = Notable signatures = The 2 most notable signatures came from Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann. Rick Santorum was the first presidential candidate to contact The Family Leader after the organization publicly announced the pledge. Michele Bachmann also contacted The Family Leader to sign the pledge, and became the first Candidate to send her signed document to the organization. Although Newt Gingrich did not sign the pledge, he wrote a lengthy letter in which he upheld many of the principles of the pledge including personal fidelity to his wife, respecting the marital bonds of others, enforcing the defense of marriage act, to support a federal marriage amendment, and to oppose any definition of marriage outside of \\"one man and one woman.\\" The pledge was also signed by former Texas governor Rick Perry.

Z-ring fluorescence is followed using a ZipA-GFP construct (green), while the chromosomal terminus is labeled with MatP-mCherry (red). A phase contrast image (gray) is overlaid to visualize the cell contour. The scale bar is 2 Œºm. The Min System is a mechanism composed of three proteins MinC, MinD, and MinE used by E. coli as a means of properly localizing the septum prior to cell division. Each component participates in generating a dynamic oscillation of FtsZ protein inhibition between the two bacterial poles to precisely specify the mid-zone of the cell, allowing the cell to accurately divide in two. This system is known to function in conjunction with a second negative regulatory system, the nucleoid occlusion system (NO), to ensure proper spatial and temporal regulation of chromosomal segregation and division.  History  The initial discovery of this family of proteins is attributed to Adler et al. (1967). First identified as E. coli mutants that could not produce a properly localized septum, resulting in the generation of minicells due to mislocalized cell division occurring near the bacterial poles. This caused miniature vesicles to pinch off, void of essential molecular constituents permitting it to exist as a viable bacterial cell. Minicells are achromosomal cells that are products of aberrant cell division, and contain RNA and protein, but little or no chromosomal DNA. This finding led to the identification of three interacting proteins involved in a dynamic system of localizing the mid-zone of the cell for properly controlled cell division.  Function  The Min proteins prevent the FtsZ ring from being placed anywhere but near the mid cell and are hypothesized to be involved in a spatial regulatory mechanism that links size increases prior to cell division to FtsZ polymerization in the middle of the cell. The MinCDE system. MinD-ATP binds to a cell pole, also binds MinC, which prevents the formation of FtsZ polymers. The MinE ring causes hydrolysis of MinD's bound ATP, turning it into ADP and releasing the complex from the membrane. The system oscillates as each pole builds up a concentration of inhibitor that is periodically dismantled. = Centering the Z-Ring = One model of Z-ring formation permits its formation only after a certain spatial signal that tells the cell that it is big enough to divide. The MinCDE system prevents FtsZ polymerization near certain parts of the plasma membrane. MinD localizes to the membrane only at cell poles and contains an ATPase and an ATP-binding domain. MinD is only able to bind to the membrane when in its ATP-bound conformation. Once anchored, the protein polymerizes, resulting in clusters of MinD. These clusters bind and then activate another protein called MinC, which has activity only when bound by MinD. MinC serves as a FtsZ inhibitor that prevents FtsZ polymerization. The high concentration of a FtsZ polymerization inhibitor at the poles prevents FtsZ from initiating division at anywhere but the mid-cell. MinE is involved in preventing the formation of MinCD complexes in the middle of the cell. MinE forms a ring near each cell pole. This ring is not like the Z-ring. Instead, it catalyzes the release of MinD from the membrane by activating MinD's ATPase. This hydrolyzes the MinD's bound ATP, preventing it from anchoring itself to the membrane. MinE prevents the MinD/C complex from forming in the center but allows it to stay at the poles. Once the MinD/C complex is released, MinC becomes inactivated. This prevents MinC from deactivating FtsZ. As a consequence, this activity imparts regional specificity to Min localization. Thus, FtsZ can form only in the center, where the concentration of the inhibitor MinC is minimal. Mutations that prevent the formation of MinE rings result in the MinCD zone extending well beyond the polar zones, preventing FtsZ to polymerize and to perform cell division. MinD requires a nucleotide exchange step to re-bind to ATP so that it can re-associate with the membrane after MinE release. The time lapse results in a periodicity of Min association that may yield clues to a temporal signal linked to a spatial signal. In vivo observations show that the oscillation of Min proteins between cell poles occurs approximately every 50 seconds. Oscillation of Min proteins, however, is not necessary for all bacterial cell division systems. Bacillus subtilis has been shown to have static concentrations of MinC and MinD at the cell poles. This system still links cell size to the ability to form a septum via FtsZ and divide. = in vitro Reconstitution = MinD (cyan) chased by MinE (magenta) to form spiraling waves on an artificial membrane. The dynamic behavior of Min proteins has been reconstituted in vitro using artificial lipid bilayers, with varying lipid composition and different confinement geometry as mimics for the cell membrane. The first pattern to be reconstituted were spiraling waves of MinD chased by MinE, followed by the reconstitution of waves of all three proteins, MinD, MinE and MinC. Importantly, MinD and MinE can self-organize into a wide variety of patterns depending on the reaction conditions. Additional study is required to elucidate the extent of temporal and spatial signaling permissible by this biological function. These in vitro systems offered unprecedented access to features such as residence times and molecular motility.

These suspension modifications are often placed in a lowrider, i.e., a vehicle modified to lower its ground clearance below that of its original design. With these modifications, the body of the car can be raised by remote control. The amount and kind of hydraulic pumps being used and the different specifications of the subject vehicle will affect the impact of such systems on the height and orientation of the vehicle. With sufficient pumps, an automobile can jump and hop upwards of six feet off the ground. Enthusiasts hold car jumping contestshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfvtNKGX2qo nationwide, which are judged on how high an automobile is able to bounce.  Origin  Lowrider automobiles originated in Mexican American communities in Southern California. Car hydraulics were originally very expensive to have installed, and were only used to be shown at car shows. However, after WWII, more Mexican Americans were able to afford older, less expensive, automobiles. In the early 1960s, these automobiles, many times classics from the 1950s, began to be modified and customized to riding low to the ground. This however, was not favored by many police in Southern California and owners of these cars were ticketed. This is the reason behind why car hydraulics were installed. This enabled these car drivers to adjust these cars to the original height when put in a compromising position. This then began to spiral into a trend that spread to African American communities, as well as White American communities, throughout Southern California and many other western states. Today, lowriders can be found anywhere, worldwide, however the greater percentage is in the Western States in the United States.  International  In 1979, Japan received a shipment of Low rider magazines, which showed on the cover a lowered Chevy in front of Mount Fuji. This magazine, Orlie's Lowriding Magazine, was a profitable magazine that advertised lowriders and hydraulic kits for their consumers. Along with these magazines came mail-order forms to purchase automotive hydraulics kits. By the 1980s, these kits along with cars, made Japan Orlie's top purchaser.  Interior  The original pumps, valves and cylinders used for the modifications to these cars were originally used for operations performed in aircraft. Using these materials required a great deal of engineering ability in order to get these cars back in working condition after being stripped. For many automobile owners, it was too expensive to have an auto shop install the hydraulics in their car for them. In the early 1960s, owners were left to do the mechanics for their own cars because the kits were not sold in stores until the later 1960s. These hydraulic kits were known as \\"trays\\" to many consumers. Many times, since these batteries, pumps and valves were made for such large aircraft originally, extra batteries were needed to assist in the hydraulics. This would run the batteries down more often than the original usage for these batteries, so it was necessary for the owners of these automobiles to charge the automobile's batteries more frequently. After using aircraft materials, trucks' liftgate materials were found to be more manageable on the car as well as easing the maintenance of the car. These cylinders, two or more, are connected to one pipe that is filled with oil, the basic fluid used for a hydraulic system. The cylinders are used to establish compression pressure of the oil, fluid being supplied by the pump, to push the automobile up. The motion of car is defined by the number of cylinder pumps installed in the vehicle. The number and placement of the pumps determines the range of motion the automobile has.  Advertisement  Car Hydraulics are many times shown and advertised in the media. In the 1970s, many movies shot in east Hollywood became known for their lowrider automobiles with fancy hydraulics. Movies such as Up in Smoke and Chong's Classic were some of the few films featuring lowriders. Even in more recent films and media, these automobiles are being displayed. Demonstrated in 1998's Wrongfully Accused, Leslie Nielson's character, Ryan Harrison, steals a car that has installed hydraulics. The movie displays the bounce given by certain hydraulic systems that are equipped in specific cars.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOJHXDgIq9w In 2004, Snoop Dogg's music video, \\"Drop It Like It's Hot\\", featuring Pharrell, a 2004 Rolls Royce Phantom is showing its installation hydraulics by tilting on the two left wheels, behind Snoop Dogg rapping.

M√∂ngke Khan died in 1259 with no declared successor, precipitating infighting between members of the Tolui family line for the title of Great Khan that escalated to a civil war. The Toluid Civil War, and the wars that followed it (such as the Berke‚ÄìHulagu war and the Kaidu‚ÄìKublai war), weakened the authority of the Great Khan over the Mongol Empire and split the empire into autonomous khanates. Background The Tolui family successfully enthroned their candidate for Great Khan, M√∂ngke, in the kurultais of 1250 and 1251. The √ñgedeid candidate for Great Khan, Shiremun, and his cousin Nakhu, were embittered by their loss and plotted a failed assassination of M√∂ngke. M√∂ngke took revenge by purging his opponents in the royal house, and members of both the Chagatai and √ñgedei families. M√∂ngke handed control over the Caucasus region to the Golden Horde in 1252. With the approval of M√∂ngke, Berke succeeded his brother, Batu, as Khan of the Golden Horde in Russia in 1255. Hulagu of the Ilkhanate seized control of the Caucasus from the Golden Horde, and his sacking of Baghdad in 1258 angered Berke, a convert to Islam. M√∂ngke Khan died in 1259 without appointing a successor. He probably favored Ariq B√∂ke, whom M√∂ngke designated in 1258 as commander of Karakorum (then capital of the empire), but he did too little else to secure Ariq B√∂ke's claim to the throne. Civil war Kublai Khan was campaigning against the southern Song in 1260 when he received news that Ariq B√∂ke was challenging him for the succession of the throne. Ariq B√∂ke formed alliances with powerful members of the Mongol nobility to endorse him as a candidate for Great Khan. Most of M√∂ngke's immediate family supported Ariq B√∂ke including the member of √ñgedei, Chagatai and Jochi. Kublai withdrew from the Song and mobilized his troops to fight Ariq B√∂ke. In China, Kublai summoned a kurultai at Kaiping, where he was elected Great Khan. This was the first kurultai to proclaim a Great Khan outside the Mongol homeland or Central Asia. Ariq B√∂ke convened his own kurultai in Karakorum that proclaimed him Great Khan a month later, creating two rival claimants for the throne. Hulagu embarked for Mongolia to attend the kurultai, but the Mamluk defeat of the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut forced him to retreat back to the Middle East. Berke capitalized on the Mamluk victory by invading the Ilkhanate, beginning the Berke‚ÄìHulagu war. Ariq B√∂ke allied with Berke Khan of the Golden Horde and Alghu of the Chagatai Khanate. Hulagu of the Ilkhanate was the sole ally of Kublai Khan. Berke supported Ariq B√∂ke because he was resentful of Hulagu, who had close ties with Kublai. Hulagu and Berke, however, became occupied with their own war and could not intervene in the Toluid Civil War. Kublai had access to supplies from the fertile lands of China, while Ariq B√∂ke had to import resources to Karakorum in the semi-arid steppes. Kublai Khan depended on these supplies from China and therefore needed Chinese popular support to win the civil war. Kublai ingratiated himself to his subjects with the help of his Chinese advisers. He presented himself as a sage emperor capable of uniting the Chinese, Korean and his fellow Mongols. While calling out Ariq B√∂ke as a destructive usurper. Kublai promised to reduce taxes, modeled his government institutions to resemble those of the Chinese dynasties, and adopted the era name of Zhongtong, which means \\"moderate rule\\". His policies were popular in northern China, but had no impact on his relations with the Southern Song. The Song invaded while Kublai was preoccupied with the civil war, and recovered territory previously lost to the Mongols. Kublai dispatched a diplomat, Hao Jing, to discuss the prospects of a peaceful resolution to the war with the Southern Song. The Song, however, rejected Kublai's overtures and imprisoned Hao for the next decade. Kublai now controlled three of the four possible supply lines to Karakorum. Kadan, Kublai's √ñgedeid ally, defended the territories of the former Western Xia from Ariq B√∂ke and commanded the forces stationed in Gansu. Kublai's troops guarded the area surrounding Yan (modern Beijing). The only supply line still open to Ariq B√∂ke was the Yenisei River valley in the northwest. When Kublai's army advanced towards Karakorum in late 1260, Ariq B√∂ke retreated from Karakorum to a tributary of the Yenisei. The oncoming winter then compelled Kublai and Ariq B√∂ke to encamp their armies and wait for spring. Ariq B√∂ke's victory against Alghu In the interim, Kublai acquired more supplies and men. He fortified Yan and the border defenses of northern China. Kadan defeated and executed Alandar, a general sent to secure the vital Central Asian trade routes for Ariq B√∂ke. Lian Xixian, one of Kublai's Confucian advisers, commanded soldiers for the khan in western China. He won a victory against Ariq B√∂ke's ally, Liu Taiping, in northwestern China, seizing food supplies intended for Ariq B√∂ke's army. Lian also drove supporters of Ariq B√∂ke out of the towns of Liangzhou and Ganzhou. In southwestern China, his forces protected Sichuan from Ariq B√∂ke's encroaching troops. Kublai paid Kadan and Lian Xixian handsomely for their military service in gifts and promotions. He rewarded Kadan with 300 packs of silk and 300 taels of silver, and appointed Lian Xixian to the position of Prime Minister of the Right in the Secretariat. Kublai's victories left Alghu as Ariq B√∂ke's only standing ally. Ariq B√∂ke convinced Alghu to take control of the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia. Chagatai's khan, Qara H√ºl√´g√º, had recently died. Alghu fought and killed Abishkha, a rival claimant to the throne endorsed by Kublai as ruler of the khanate. Alghu was one of Ariq B√∂ke's strongest supporters and he appointed him khan of Chagatai. The khanate became an important source of Ariq B√∂ke's provisions. Ariq B√∂ke gave Alghu complete control over tax revenues in the region. In 1261, Kublai and Ariq B√∂ke engaged in battle at Shimultai. Ariq B√∂ke lost the battle and retreated. He returned to the region ten days later to challenge Kublai's forces near the Khingan Mountains of eastern Mongolia. The troops that Ariq B√∂ke attacked were not personally led by Kublai, and made up only a small portion of Kublai's army. Even so, the battle ended in a stalemate. Meanwhile, most of Mongolia was now under the control of Kublai, threatening Ariq B√∂ke's control of the Yenisei Valley supply line. A weakened Ariq B√∂ke entreated Alghu for help. Alghu refused, and executed the envoys sent by Ariq B√∂ke, who had demanded a share of Alghu's tax revenues. At this time, a rebellion in China distracted Kublai from the civil war, and he departed for Kaiping instead of further pursuing Ariq B√∂ke. Ariq B√∂ke went to war with Alghu after the threat of an attack by Kublai receded. Alghu defeated Ariq B√∂ke's commander, Khara Bukha, near the Ili River in Xinjiang, but lost his headquarters at Almalikh to Ariq B√∂ke. He withdrew to the oasis cities of the Tarim Basin. Ariq B√∂ke was now left with few allies, and several of his supporters deserted from his side following his action and atrocities against the Chagatai Khanate. √úr√ºng Tash, son of M√∂ngke, defected, taking his father's tamga seal from Ariq B√∂ke and giving it to Kublai as a symbol of his loyalty. Alghu then returned to the Ili River to remove Ariq B√∂ke from Xinjiang. Ariq B√∂ke lacked the resources or the allies to defend himself. He travel to Shangdu alone and surrendered to Kublai in 1264, ending the civil war. Aftermath Kublai imprisoned Ariq B√∂ke, but did not immediately punish him. Kublai's supporters wanted retribution, so Kublai ignored Ariq B√∂ke for a year as punishment. He conducted a purge to eliminate officials in the Mongol government who sympathized with Ariq B√∂ke. Kublai accused Bolghai, an important Mongol official who served under M√∂ngke, of treachery for conspiring with Ariq B√∂ke. Kublai authorized the execution of Bolghai and other Ariq B√∂ke supporters. Kublai summoned a kurultai to decide a punishment for Ariq B√∂ke and solidify his own claim to the throne. Kublai was reluctant to punish his brother without public support of the Mongol nobility. Ariq B√∂ke died mysteriously in 1266 while still imprisoned, leading to speculation that Kublai had secretly poisoned him. Ariq B√∂ke's defeat by Kublai could not stop the fracturing of the empire. When Kublai convened his kurultai to confirm his status as Great Khan, none of the three other khans attended. Berke and Hulagu continued fighting, until Hulagu died in 1265. The √ñgedei line sought to exploit the disunity to advance the interests of their own family. They held a grudge against the Tolui family for the kurultai of 1251 and the subsequent purge of the √ñgedeids after the assassination plot. Kaidu, from the √ñgedei family, believed that a member of the √ñgedeids deserved the title of Great Khan and started an insurrection in 1269 against Kublai that lasted for decades. Most of the western khanates did not recognize Kublai as Great Khan. Although some of them still asked Kublai to confirm the enthronement of their new regional khans, the four khanates were functionally independent sovereign states. The Ilkhanate based in Persia and the Yuan dynasty based in China had close diplomatic relations, and shared scientific and cultural knowledge, but military cooperation between all four Mongol khanates would never occur again ‚Äî the united Mongol Empire had disintegrated.

Though solar maps are illustrated in many forms, a solar map essentially records where and to what extent a certain location experiences a certain amount of sunlight or radiation. It normally combines topographic, meteorological, and sometimes financial data to help scholars or consumers and investors in promoting awareness of the potential of solar power.  Different Forms of Solar Maps  Solar maps come in a variety of different forms. The form in which they appear mostly depends on the background of the person studying the map. = Scholarly Solar maps = As the name implies, these maps are generally studied by scholars or people that come from an academic background. Solar maps in this form, for the most part, illustrate the extent to which a certain area experiences sunlight through the use of multiple shades and colors such as blue, green, yellow, red, and brown. These maps include quantitative data that shows specifically which regions of the map is experiencing certain specified amounts of solar energy or radiation from the sun. The regions(i.e. countries, towns, continents, cities etc.) that are illustrated in these solar maps may depend on the topic that the scholar studying. Normally, they are simple, and focused to prove a point that a scholar is making. = Interactive Solar Map = Unlike Scholarly Solar Maps, Interactive solar Maps are online and have a lot more detail and miscellaneous information. In most cases, these solar maps are constructed out of satellite images and allow internet users to zoom in and out of the map that they are viewing much in the way that Google Earth and Bing Aerial operates. In addition to this feature of these kinds of websites, the user is allowed to zoom in on a building, click on it, and receive data on the buildings solar potential, the amount of money that could be saved on the buildings electrical bills, the building's footprint, etc. On these websites of solar maps, there is the necessary amount of information so much that the internet user can reflect upon his own consumption and his own actions in deciding in pursuing cleaner and more eco-friendly alternatives of consuming electrical power.  How a Solar Map is made  Making a solar map is a complicated process. It requires sophisticated instruments to measure certain environmental conditions and a big background in computer science in constructing solar maps. = Data Collection = First of all, the type of data collected in making a solar map varies to the type of solar map that is being made. There would be some types of solar maps that would include other types of information than others. As long as the information presented on the solar map pertains to information of measurements of Solar Energy or solar radiation the map can be considered a solar map.  Types of Data measured and collected  In order for a solar map to be made, two main types of data must be collected. Those two types of data include Meteorological Data and Topographical Data. The Meteorological data is used in calculations pertaining to Solar Energy. Such measurements of this type of data include the measurements of the position of the sun, overall atmospheric conditions, latitude, and shading. Topographical data on the other hand, is used in illustrating the amount of area exposed to a certain degree of radiation from the sun or in calculations that present how much area of a physical object is experiencing direct contact with the sun's rays. In some cases, Financial Data may also be collected to be presented on a solar map. When this happens, that means that the solar map would appear online for a certain city. The reasons why financial data is collected and presented on these solar maps is to encourage a certain productive behavior among citizens.  Technologies used  Some of the complex tools or instrument utilized in developing Solar Maps include LiDAR Technologies, the ESRI ArcGIS server, Solar Automated Feature Extraction (SAFE) technologies, and several others instruments. All these technologies are used in either collecting data, processing data, and even in developing the solar map itself.  Roles of Solar Maps  According to policy makers in certain cities, a Solar Map serves multiple roles. According to government officials, solar maps help keep track of progress on sustainability goals for the city or town in which they live. If they prefer to establish a more eco-friendly environment, a solar map, in their minds, would be the right tool to use in measuring this goal. Another idea in why a local city government may want to provide a solar map online is to promote self-awareness of citizens own electrical consumption as well as to educate citizens of the possible rewards of using solar power instead of other conventional sources of power. By reflecting on the potential savings that a homeowner can earn, the thought goes, the idea of a high cost of installing solar power could be diminished. Thus encouraging homeowners to install photovoltaic panels.

The military airfield, commanded by a Group Captain rank IAF officer, lies 40 kilometres southwest of state capital Patna and is spread over an area of around 900 acres. Civilian Operations In 2016, the Airport Authority of India (AAI) proposed to develop a civil enclave at the Bihta airbase to serve as a second airport for Patna. The Indian Air Force gave its consent in April 2016 for commercial flight operations from Bihta as a medium-term measure for development air operations from Patna. The terminal building of the civil enclave will have the capacity to cater up to 2.5 million passengers per annum. It will be two-storied, with the ground floor for arrival and first floor for the departure of passengers. The Khagaul-Shivala-Bihta road, which will be broadened to four lanes, will connect the airport with the city. AAI had earlier estimated a requirement of 600 acres of land for the first Phase and another 790 acres for the second Phase in lieu of the existing Jay Prakash Narayan Airport in Patna. In October 2016, Bihar cabinet approved the Patna master plan 2031 which envisaged development of a new airport at Bihta. The Bihar government identified 126 acres of land at Vishambharpur and Kutlupur for construction of the civil enclave. In November 2016, the Bihar cabinet approved a budget of 260 crore for the acquisition of 126 acres of land for the project. The AAI and State Government approved the civil enclave design in July 2019, with construction expected to begin by the end of 2019. The first phase entails a two-stored building covering an area of 25,000 square metres. The civil enclave is expected to be ready by 2022 and will cost of over 500 crores. In the first phase, the terminal building will be equipped with five aerobridges and parking bays for five aircraft. In the next phase, the terminal area will be doubled to 50,000 square metres with five additional aerobridges and five additional parking bays. Of the 126 acres of land acquired by the State government near Bihta airbase, 108 acres will be used by AAI to build the civil enclave while the remaining 18 acres will be used by the State Government for development of amenities, including a VIP lounge, a hotel and a hangar. Bihar government transferred 108 acre land to the AAI for Bihta civil enclave. The built-up area of the terminal building at Bihta would be approximately 50,000sq metres. Over Rs 350 crore is estimated to be spent on the project. Once completed, Bihta airport will have the capacity to handle 2.5 million passengers per annum (MPA).

It is the first book in a trilogy series consisting of Make Lemonade, True Believer (the second installment), and This Full House (the third installment). These novels are characterized by their free verse style. The trilogy is unified by its protagonist LaVaughn, a fourteen-year-old girl who recounts her experiences and perspective from first-person point of view. All three books have been published as audiobooks read by Heather Alicia Simms. Make Lemonade has been translated into Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish.  Synopsis  = Plot = LaVaughn notices a flyer for a babysitting job for two kids, Jeremy and Jilly. She takes the number and applies for the job. LaVaughn is greeted by Jolly, who is her new employer. She meets the kids and connects with them. In that time, LaVaughn plants some lemon seeds that Jeremy would sit in front of for some time each day. Later at her house, she asks her mom if she can take the job. Reluctantly, she accepts and gives her permission. Jolly shows up late one day with lacerations on her face. LaVaughn has her mom come to help with Jolly, and her mom tells Jolly she needs to take hold of her life and criticizes Jolly. A few weeks later, Jolly comes home and announces that she was fired. LaVaughn learns that it was because Jolly's boss was sexually abusing her and Jolly stabbed his hand with a pencil to make him stop. The boss fired her for the act. Jolly tries several times to file reports of sexual abuse to administration, but they ignore her calls and complaints. Jolly tries unsuccessfully to get a new job and rejects LaVaughn's suggestion that she go back to school so that she can get better jobs, for fear that her children might get taken away from her. Meanwhile, the lemon seeds that LaVaughn planted with Jeremy never grew, so she decides to plant some more and hopes that they will grow this time around. LaVaughn contacts people at her school and finds out that if Jolly can go back to school, she can get free daycare for the kids. Finally, after talking to the school employees herself, Jolly reluctantly joins the program. Jolly's school program notes Jolly's problems with time management, however, and LaVaughn returns to babysit for Jolly again for an hour every day, like before. In an attempt to get some money, Jolly decides that she will write a letter to a billionaire who sometimes helps people who write to him. LaVaughn thinks that it is a crazy idea, but helps Jolly write the letter. LaVaughn notices an improvement in Jolly's self-esteem around this time. Soon afterward, LaVaughn brings in new lemon seeds, because the second round of seeds did not grow either. Later, Jolly gets a letter back from the billionaire with a $5 check to treat her kids but also a promise of some more money if she gives proof of her GED. One afternoon, LaVaughn and Jolly are both watching the kids when Jilly chokes on a toy. Jolly does CPR on Jilly, which was something that she had been studying in her classes recently. Jilly is taken to the hospital. LaVaughn and Jeremy explain to LaVaughn's mom what happened, and she begrudgingly praises Jolly for the first time. = Reception and themes = Make Lemonade generated starred reviews from Publishers Weekly and Booklist and received several awards. Although praised by many, the novel also raised concerns from organizations, such as schools in New York, that some of the content is inappropriate for middle-school students. Some of these controversial topics include teenage pregnancy and discussion of sexual harassment. The book was dedicated \\"for young mothers\\", which many people consider representative of the book's content and central focus on Jolly, the teenaged mother of two children. The novel discusses her encounters and struggles with topics such as poverty, unemployment, teenage pregnancy, parenting, sexual harassment, education, drugs, and isolation from family. The author stated in an interview with The Horn Book Magazine that she kept the format of the novel in free verse partly \\"...because Make Lemonade is dedicated to young mothers. I wanted young girls in Jolly‚Äôs situation, maybe pregnant or with babies, and maybe going back to school, to be able to say, 'I read two chapters!'\\" Many people have also speculated on the ethnicity of the characters, although the author denied any intended character ethnicities and claimed that she was \\"very careful of not having them be any race, any particular ethnicity\\" = Awards and honors = * American Library Association (ALA) Best Book for Young Adults * American Library Association (ALA) Notable Children's Book * Bank Street Child Study Book Award, 1993 * Best Kids' Book of 1993, 1993 * Best YA Novels of All Time, English Journal, November 2005 * Booklist Top of the List winner * Bulletin for the Center for Children's Books Blue Ribbon Book, 1993 * Children's Book of Distinction, 1994 * Golden Kite Award, 1994 * Iowa Teen Award Nominee, 1996-1997 * Michigan Library Association Thumbs Up!

This function is achieved by preventing the formation of the divisome Z-ring around the poles.  History  When initially discovered in E.coli, MinC was believed to form a stable cap by binding with MinD at the bacterial caps in a stable and static manner, thereby specifying the mid-zone of the cell by lower-concentration or lack of this complex in that region, alleviating inhibition of Z-ring formation. However, Raskin & de Boer applied live-cell imaging with GFP fusion proteins to reveal a dynamic interaction of the Min proteins, demonstrating that MinC and MinD, with the essential help of MinE, actually rapidly oscillate between the two poles in a non-static manner. MinC is found in diverse genera, including Neisseria, Bacillus, and Synechocystis, but is absent in an equally wide assortment of genera (e.g. Caulobacter, Mycobacterium). Many bacteria that lack MinC carry alternative proteins that can position their Z-ring.  Function  MinC is known to dimerize and functions as an FtsZ protein inhibitor, antagonizing its structure assembly when in a high enough concentration. The protein has the ability to disassemble the ZapA, ZapB and ZipA proteins which preferentially bind to the FtsZ scaffold protein and which are needed to initiate cell division. Concentrations of MinC are lowest at the mid-zone of bacterial cells, thereby permitting septum formation and scaffold assembly at the cellular mid-zone since the Min System proteins (MinCDE) are lowest in concentration in this region, alleviating the physical inhibition on the proteins required to initiate division.

It is required to generate pole to pole oscillations prior to bacterial cell division as a means of specifying the midzone of the cell. It is a peripheral membrane ATPase involved in plasmid partitioning.  History  When first discovered in E.coli, MinD was thought to associate with MinC and form a stable cap at each bacterial pole, thereby specifying the mid-zone of the cell by alleviating inhibitory pressures in that region. Through the use of live-cell imaging with GFP fusion proteins, Raskin and de Boer revealed a dynamic interaction of the Min proteins, demonstrating that MinC and MinD instead rapidly oscillate between the two poles in a non-static manner.  Function  The ATPase activity of MinD is activated by MinE while in the presence of phospholipids, suggesting that the binding to the membrane induces a conformational change allowing it to become susceptible to MinE activation. MinD activity is dependent on local MinD concentration, suggesting an oligomerization process and cooperativity. = In vitro studies = In vitro studies of the Min system are done on a two dimensional supporting lipid bilayer. Fluorescent labelling of MinD has revealed that it tends to form a membrane-bound carpet in MinE mutants (ATP cannot be limiting). Upon re-addition of MinE, the system becomes unstable and dynamic. Localized foci of increased MinE concentration result in subsequent MinD membrane detachment and through several iterations of this attachment and detachment process, the emergence of standing waves was observed. This process is indicative of the Min system‚Äôs ability to self-organize. Fluorescence studies reveal the formation of a focused wave-front. Single molecule dynamics revealed that MinD dimerizes while membrane-bound, resulting in a stronger membrane association at the rear of the standing wave and giving rise to a diffusivity gradient. This observation explains the presence of focused bands of fluorescence in these standing wave studies. Additional study of this system and its interacting molecular partners is required to fully characterize the min system and to understand the molecular dynamics.

Retrieved 18 March 2014 History Chlo√© made its debut in the Paris Salon in 1875 with great success. With that success, it and Lefebvre won the Gold Medal of Honour in 1875. It was subsequently displayed in art exhibitions such as the French Gallery at the Sydney International Exhibition in 1879 and the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880. Chlo√© was then purchased by Dr. Thomas Fitzgerald of Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, for 850 guineas. Controversy arose when the painting was to be exhibited on Sundays. The Presbyterian Assembly found the painting to be too scandalous to show on Sundays, so it had to eventually be taken down from galleries.\\"Chloe\\", Young and Jackson. 18 March 2014 Upon Fitzgerald's death in 1908, the painting was auctioned off to Norman Figsby Young. Henry Young and Thomas Jackson bought Chlo√© in 1908 from Norman Figsby Young and placed the painting in the bar of their hotel. Influence on soldiers Chlo√© captivated many soldiers who frequented the bar of Young and Jackson's Hotel during World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Letters were addressed to her from the trenches in Turkey, France, and Papua New Guinea, promising to return to her. American soldiers even went as far as coming up with a plan to abduct her.

Art experts said the damage was minor and would not affect the overall value of the painting. It was repaired at the Ian Potter Conservation Centre in the Ian Potter Museum of Art in Melbourne, where it waited for protective German glass to be imported, and was restored to the hotel bar on 13 October 2004.Villarreal, Ignacio, ed. \\"Melbourne's Famous Chloe Painting Restored\\", Art Daily. Retrieved 18 March 2014. The model The model for the painting was named Marie, not Chlo√©. Of Persian descent, she was born to a poor family in 1856. She left home at a young age and started posing for artists to gain some income for herself and her sister. She was 19 when she modelled for Chlo√©. There is controversy about the nature of her relationship with Lefebvre. Some have claimed that she had a sexual relationship with him, while others have said that he rejected her. Another account says that he seduced both Marie and her sister. Whatever the truth, a year after Lefebvre completed the Chlo√© painting, he married her sister. A year after that, Marie hosted a party with close friends, during which she slipped away into the kitchen and made and drank a poisonous substance. The exact reason for her suicide remains unknown but some have speculated that she did it because of her unrequited love for Lefebvre. Young and Jackson Hotel Chlo√© is to remain part of the hotel forever, as decided by the National Trust and Heritage of Victoria in 1988. The hotel holds free information tours and sessions to teach people the history, origins, and the prominence of the painting.

History  MinE was initially thought to assemble as a static ring at the cell center, thereby preventing the MinCD inhibition complex from localizing and binding there and instead influencing the complex to occupy each bacterial pole. Raskin and de Boer later revealed a dynamic interaction of the Min proteins, where the unstable interaction between the proteins resulted in pole to pole oscillations, resulting in lower concentrations of MinCD complex at the cell center.  Function  MinE is a topological specificity factor that counters the activity of MinCD division inhibitor at the mid-cell division site. MinE functions as a dimer and will bind to membrane-bound MinCD complex, altering its binding dynamics. MinE has membrane binding activity and can also interact with MinD only when on the membrane, suggesting a conformational change in MinD upon interacting with phospholipids that makes it vulnerable to MinE activity. MinE both positively and negatively regulates MinD interaction with membrane. Deletion analysis has revealed that there exist two domains of interest in MinE, each with separate function. The N-Terminal domain contains the anti-MinCD domain that is necessary and sufficient to interact with MinD and counteract the MinCD-mediated division inhibition and to stimulate the ATPase activity of MinD, resulting in MinD‚Äôs detachment from the membrane after ATP hydrolysis. MinE is also known to form a ring near each pole. The purpose of this ring structure is to catalyze the release of membrane-bound MinD in turn, imparting regional specificity of Min protein localization. = Structure = Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of truncated MinE revealed a long alpha-helix as well as two anti-parallel beta-strands. These structures are hypothesized to mediate the homodimerization by interaction of alpha/beta structures. These structural studies also support the theory that the MinE ring structure may actually form a multimeric filamentous structure as a function of the interaction of these alpha and beta units. It has also been hypothesized that MinE may potentially form higher order structures, and may not simply be limited to ring formation. Additional structural study and molecular imaging is needed to elucidate the higher order polymerization structures of MinE and to determine their dynamics on the remaining Min system. Recently, computational models have been applied to explore the limits of this system.

It was created by the cellist Jules Delsart. The A major Violin Sonata is one of C√©sar Franck's best-known compositions, and is considered one of the finest sonatas for violin and piano ever written.Music Web International After thorough historical study based on reliable documents, the Jules Delsart arrangement for cello (the piano part remains the same as in the violin sonata) was published by G. Henle Verlag as an Urtext edition. In his biography of Franck, Jo√´l-Marie Fauquet reports on how there came to be a cello version. After a performance of the violin sonata in Paris on 27 December 1887, the cellist Jules Delsart, who was actively participating in this concert as a quartet player, was so enthusiastic that he begged Franck for permission to arrange the violin part for cello. In a letter that Franck wrote his cousin presumably only a little later, we read: ‚ÄòMr Delsart is now working on a cello arrangement of the sonata‚Äô. According to this, the arrangement for cello did not proceed from the publishing house, but from a musician who was a friend of the composer‚Äôs (both taught at the Paris Conservatoire). There is also no doubt about Franck‚Äôs consenting to this arrangement. Since the piano part remained unchanged, the renowned publishing house Hamelle did not publish the arrangement in an edition all its own (c. 1888), but simply enclosed the cello part with its separate plate number in the score. During Franck's lifetime the A major sonata was offered in two (more or less) equal variant settings (piano and violin; piano and cello), with the explicit reference to the arranger (Jules Delsart) of the cello version. C√©sar Franck probably had nothing against the title page in that he gave away appropriate copies to friends and acquaintances, including a dedication to the musicologist Adolf Sandberger. Comparing the two solo parts (violin vs. cello) demonstrates that Delsart kept very closely to the original and generally limited himself to transposing the violin part to the lower register. In only a few passages are there exceptions where Delsart adapted the music to the technical playing conditions of the cello. Delsart's arrangement of Franck's sonata for piano and cello has been one of the beloved sonatas in the instrument's repertoire. With the publication of the Urtext edition by G. Henle Verlag in 2013, the integrity of the cello version is justified. (At the heart of G. Henle Verlag's programme are the so-called Urtext Editions. They are characterized by their correct musical text, drawn up following strict scholarly principles, with an extensive commentary on the sources consulted ‚Äì covering autographs, copies and early printings ‚Äì and details regarding the readings.) On the \\"oral and written history\\" that Cesar Franck first conceived the sonata for cello and piano (before the commission from Eug√®ne Ysa√øe arrived), Pablo Casals wrote in 1968, \\"... what I remember distinctly is that Ysaye told me that Franck had told him that the Sonata was intended for violin or cello. That was the reason for my taking it up and playing it so much during my tours.\\" Antoine Ysa√øe, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe's son, expressed in a letter that there is a version in C√©sar Franck's handwriting for cello.

Titus is a Roman nobleman and a general in the war who distinguished himself in ten years of service against the Goths. Despite his exemplary service the war's toll on him is sufficient that he declined the emperorship. Nonetheless, he begins the play as an exemplary citizen. However faith in the traditions of the Roman system of government eventually leads to his death as others seek revenge. Comparisons Some sources claim that the name Andronicus comes from Andronicus Comnenus, a 12th-century Byzantine emperor, who shared Titus' proclivity for shooting arrows with messages attached. When Anthony Hopkins played a stylized version of the character in the 1999 film Titus, he described the character as a combination of King Lear, Barney and Hannibal Lecter. Although Titus Andronicus is the main character, some productions have adapted the play to be seen through Young Lucius. Role in play The play begins with Titus returning home after many years at war with the Goths, bringing with him the remaining four of his twenty-five sons. Titus is selected by the people of Rome to be the new emperor but refuses this offer due to his already advanced age. In his stead he chooses the former emperor's eldest son Saturninus. By the ceremonial sacrifice of his most noble captive, Alarbus ‚Äì the eldest son of Tamora, Queen of the Goths ‚Äì Titus unknowingly sparks off a series of events that are motivated by the desire for revenge. Throughout the play Titus seeks revenge on Tamora for injustices against his family while simultaneously being the target of Tamora's own quest for revenge. Titus murders five people during the play, including one of his sons and his daughter. Displaying strict adherence to Roman law he murders his son, Mutius, for defying the order he has given for his daughter Lavinia to marry the new emperor Saturninus. The second act of filicide occurs at the end of the play when Titus murders Lavinia so that she will not have to live with the shame of having been raped and mutilated on Tamora's orders by her sons Chiron and Demetrius. In Titus' final act of revenge upon Tamora he kills Chiron and Demetrius and uses their blood and bones as the ingredients of a pie. \\"Let me go grind their bones to powder small, / And with this hateful liquor temper it, / And in that paste let their vile heads be baked\\" (5.3.197‚Äì199). Titus serves this pie to Tamora before killing her. As is customary in a Shakespearean tragedy and as a Senecan hero, Titus Andronicus also dies in the end, killed by Saturninus who is then in turn killed by Titus' last remaining son, Lucius, bringing to an end the cycle of revenge that has prolonged the play.

History The \\"contredanse,\\" the French-renamed country dance as indicated in a 1710 dance book called Recuil de Contredance, began in the English courts and was imported to Haiti via France (Brittany) through colonial rule and had been incorporated with African influences in Saint-Domingue. Contredanse flourished as it took on this creolized form establishing strong traditions in Haiti that would later influence variant forms throughout the Caribbean. Origins The usage of the drums, poetic song, antiphonal song form, and imitations of the colonial elite dance were the elements that had already begun to transform the contredanse. Evolution A broad group of Saint-Domingue planters, along with their slaves that fled the Haitian Revolution resettled in the old Providence of Oriente in eastern Cuba, that began coffee production around the cities of Santiago and Guantanamo. This settlement provided an impetus of musical activities in those eastern areas. So, this creolized version of contredanse imported from Haiti would fuse with and reinforce the criolla over the next couple of decades. Rhythmic styles such as the tango, habanera, and the cinquillo became dominant patterns as new emerging styles and led to the development of the contradanza, and later in 1879, the danz√≥n; a couples dance and is regarded as the first truly national dance genre of Cuba. M√©ringue A five-note musical figure called quintolet (cinquillo in Cuba and the rest of the Spanish speaking Caribbean), became a chief feature to the kontradans and would figure prominently into the Haitian folk dance music called m√©ringue (a whipped egg and sugar confection popular in 18th century France), presumably because it captured the essence of the light nature of the dance where one gracefully shifts their weight between feet in a very fluid movement, animating the final section of the Haitian kontradans.

Personal In 1950, Hine married children's literature author Sesyle Joslin, with whom he often collaborated on writing projects. Writing career During World War II, Hine wrote for Yank Magazine as a staff correspondent from July 1943 to December 1945. He developed a wry, smooth writing style filled with sexual innuendo that later served him well in crafting popular novels. For example, in the July 7, 1944, issue of Yank Hine wrote about a lucky fighting cock in \\"Yanks at Home Abroad\\": :Persian Field Command ‚Äì Army pets range from the auk to the zebra, but a trucking station in northern Iran proudly claims a simple barnyard fowl as its mascot. The rooster, a medium-sized Mediterranean Red, doesn‚Äôt even have a name as yet, but if you believe its owner, T-5 Wallace Grube of New York, N.Y., it is potentially the best fighting cock in the history of the sport. :The Red, a well-fed fowl with an iridescent feathered neck that sparkles like the rainbow, has one of the finest harems in the Moslem Middle East. He struts about the yard daily, the idol of six curvesome hens and the envy of his GI masters. Hine and his wife Sesyle Joslin coauthored the children's book Is There a Mouse in the House? (Macmillan, 1965). Under the name \\"G. B. Kirtland\\" they wrote One Day in Ancient Rome (Harcourt, 1961), One Day in Elizabethan England (Harcourt, 1962), and One Day in Aztec Mexico (Harcourt, 1963). Hine's novel Lord Love a Duck (Atheneum: 1961) told the story of Alan Musgrave, a confident high school student skilled at karate and hypnosis who calls himself 'Mollymauk' after a rare bird. When Musgrave meets attractive Barbara Ann Greene, he uses his talents to help her get what she wants in life. The novel was made into an award-winning comedy film in 1966 starring Tuesday Weld and Roddy McDowell. His novel Bewitched (1965: Dell Publishing) was a spinoff of the popular TV series by the same name. According to the publisher, \\"They were young, married, and doing what comes supernaturally!\\" Hine also wrote an original novel based on I Dream of Jeannie (1966: Pocket Books) under the pseudonym \\"Dennis Brewster\\". According to the back cover's blurb, \\"Viewers who have roared at the astronautical antics of Captain Nelson and his sprightly imp, Jeannie, can now read this madcap, laugh-filled adventure of that wacky twosome from blast-off to landing.\\" Hine was a frequent contributor to magazines such as The Saturday Review, Collier's Weekly, Holiday and the Saturday Evening Post. He also dabbled in film and was listed as an executive producer of the movie Lord of the Flies.

Early life Starobinsky is a former student of Yakov Zeldovich at Moscow State University from where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1972. In 1975, he earned a PhD degree from the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and is now a senior scientist at the Institute. From 1990 to 1997, he headed the department of gravitation and cosmology and, from 1999 to 2003, he was the Institute's deputy director. In the 1970s, Starobinsky worked on the theory of particle creation in the early universe and particle generation and radiation from rotating black holes (1973/74), a precursor of the theory of Hawking radiation. He was also, in 1979, a pioneer in the theory of cosmic inflation in the Russian scientific literature. The phase of inflation postulates that the universe size grew quadrillion times faster that the speed of light. Starobinsky worked on Starobinsky inflation, a modification to general relativity which attempts to explain inflation. In the American and western European physics literature, Alan Guth was considered a pioneer of the theory during the same time period. Starobinsky was a visiting scientist in 1991 at the √âcole Normale Superieure; in 2006, at the Institut Henri Poincar√©; in 1994 and 2007, at the Yukawa Institute of the University of Kyoto; and, in 2000/2001, at the Research Center for the Early Universe at the University of Tokyo. Starobinsky is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 2010 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 1996, he received the A. A. Friedmann Prize of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Since 1991, he has been a co-editor of the JETP Letters; since 1992, the International Journal of Modern Physics D; from 1993 to 1996, Classical and Quantum Gravity; and, from 1989 to 1997, General Relativity and Gravitation. Honors and awards In 2009 Starobinsky and Viatcheslav Mukhanov won the Tomalla Prize, with Starobinsky cited for his contributions to the theory of cosmological inflation and specifically, for the calculation of the gravitational radiation generated in the inflationary phase of the universe.Tomalla Prize In 2010 Starobinsky received the Oskar Klein Medal. Starobinsky and Mukhanov received, in 2012, the Amaldi Medal and, in 2013, the Gruber Prize in Cosmology.

The Nyatamaru Ajima Pyakhan dance at Nyata during Pahan Charhe. PƒÅhƒÅn Charhe (Devanagari: ‡§™‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•á) also known as PƒÅsƒÅ Charhe (‡§™‡§æ‡§∏‡§æ ‡§ö‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•á) is one of the greatest religious festivals of the year in Nepal Mandala. It is celebrated with particular fervor in Kathmandu, and consists of a conglomeration of activities including parades, masked dances, horse racing and religious worship held over three days in different places. Pahan means \\"guest\\" and pasa mean \\"friend\\" in Nepal Bhasa. Charhe means \\"fourteenth day of the lunar fortnight\\" when the festival commences. It starts on the 14th day of the dark fortnight of ChillƒÅ (‡§ö‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ), the fifth month in the lunar Nepal Era calendar. Inviting friends and relatives to one's home and honoring them with a feast is one of the highlights of the festival. Pahan Charhe is held according to the lunar calendar, so the dates are changeable. In 2015, the festival will be marked from 19-21 March. Day one The celebrations start with the worship of the deity Luku Mahadyah (‡§≤‡•Å‡§ï‡•Å ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É) in the evening. He is one of the forms of the Hindu god Shiva. Luku Mahadyah means \\"sunken Mahadyah\\", and his image is enshrined in a hole in the ground, often in a rubbish corner. Householders perform their devotions to the deity by making offerings of a feast including meat and wine. Rape blooms (‡§≤‡•Å‡§Å‡§¨‡•Å‡§Å) and radish blooms (‡§µ‡§π‡§¨‡•Å‡§Å) are special offerings of the festival, and are considered to symbolize gold and silver respectively. At Nyata in Kathmandu, sacred masked dances are shown on the stone platform at the street corner. It is known as Nyatamaru AjimƒÅ PyƒÅkhan or Swetkali Dance. The dance drama is performed by actors wearing masks representing various deities. The dance starts in the evening and lasts throughout the night. The historic neighborhood of Nyata is also known as Naradevi. Day two The main event of the second day, which coincides with Ghode Jatra, the horse festival, is the Dyah LwƒÅkegu (‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§≤‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•á‡§ó‡•Å) ceremony at Tundikhel parade ground in Kathmandu where portable shrines of the AjimƒÅ mother goddesses are brought together. Ghode Jatra consists of horse races and other activities organized by the Nepal Army at Tundikhel. At Bal Kumari in the neighboring city of Lalitpur, a one horse race is held. Images of seven mother goddesses Lumadhi AjimƒÅ, Kanga AjimƒÅ, Mhaypi AjimƒÅ, Takati AjimƒÅ, Mayti AjimƒÅ, Yatamaru AjimƒÅ and BachhalƒÅ AjimƒÅ are installed on portable shrines and paraded in their respective localities of Kathmandu. Late at night, they are carried on the shoulders of their attendants and assembled at Tundikhel accompanied by musical bands. After all the palanquins arrive, the Dyah LwƒÅkegu ceremony is held when the entourages accompanying them exchange flaming torches symbolizing the meeting of the goddesses. The palanquin procession of the AjimƒÅ goddesses was started by King Amar Malla in Nepal Sambat 580 (1460). Day three Dyah Lwakegu festival at Asan. The concluding event is the gathering of the palanquins of three AjimƒÅ mother goddesses Lumadhi AjimƒÅ, Kanga AjimƒÅ and TebƒÅhƒÅ AjimƒÅ at the market square of Asan for another Dyah LwƒÅkegu ceremony. Prior to the event, the portable shrines are paraded through the streets of Kathmandu escorted by musical bands. The palanquin bearers, musicians and followers wear red, blue and yellow caps representing their respective neighborhoods. The processions stop frequently to allow devotees to make offerings to them. When the palanquins reach Asan through various routes, the Dyah LwƒÅkegu ceremony is held. During the Dyah LwƒÅkegu ceremony, participants accompanying the shrines exchange flaming torches as crowds of onlookers fill the market square. Rice flat breads known as chatƒÅnmari (‡§ö‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç‡§Æ‡§∞‡§ø) are scattered on the palanquins from the rooftops of houses around the square. The festival re-enacts the meeting of the three AjimƒÅ mother goddesses who are sisters. A seasonal song with a melancholy tune is the theme music of the Pahan Charhe celebrations. Musical bands play the song when participating in the processions of the mother goddesses. Nepalese residing abroad celebrate the festival by holding get-togethers.

A K≈çk≈´tai () was a term used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) to designate a military aviation unit, similar to the Air Groups in other air arms and services of the time. (Group in the British Royal Air Force, Gruppe in the German Luftwaffe, Groupe in the French Arm√©e de l'Air etc.) A K≈çk≈´tai could be based at land or on board aircraft carriers and could contain up to hundreds of men and aircraft. For example, the famous 343 K≈çk≈´tai was a land based fighter group while the 652nd K≈çk≈´tai was a carrier- based bomber group. K≈çk≈´tai were divided into smaller units called Hik≈çtai, which were the equivalent of a squadron. K≈çk≈´tai were usually divided into three Hik≈çtai. In general, most pilots and aircrew in the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service were non-commissioned officers. The word K≈çk≈´tai is abbreviated with the abbreviation \\"Ku\\" (Á©∫). 343 Ku, for example, stands for 343 K≈çk≈´tai. In the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) the equivalent unit was the Sentai. Organisation K≈çk≈´tai (air group) was equivalent to a US group or a RAF wing. A K≈çk≈´tai in the broadest terms could comprise a flight and base element of either a carrier or land based air group. In terms of the flight element, it was generally composed of 18 to 27 aircraft and took the name of the carrier or air station where it was originally formed. It could also be either homogeneous or composed of different types of aircraft. The land-based units had larger numbers of aircraft, and could number from approximately 24 to a 100 or more aircraft. They were more homogeneous and came under the command of the naval district where their home naval air station was located in, and later were designated either by a number or by the name of that particular station. The air groups and stations outside those ports were placed under the command of the nearest naval base (chinjufu). From the establishment of the IJN's first land based air unit at Yokosuka until the end of the Pacific war, the term K≈çk≈´tai meant both a naval air station and the flying unit that was stationed there. The flying unit (Hik≈çkitai or hik≈çtai) operated the aircraft, and the rest of the personnel of any K≈çk≈´tai operated and maintained the ground facilities of the station at which the unit was stationed. Just as the aircraft and flight crew on board a Japanese carrier or a seaplane tender were made an integral part of a ships complement, when land-based or shore based (seaplane) air units were formed, the bases at which they were stationed were seen as equivalent of the ships of the carrier based hik≈çtai formed a part of. There were over 90 naval air groups at the start of the Pacific War. History The land-based k≈çk≈´tai system was set up in 1916, determined that naval air stations and air groups would be organized as needed, at either naval ports (gunk≈ç) or strategic ports (y≈çk≈ç). Their designations were taken from the names of those places and functioning under the authority of those stations. In 1919, the IJN set out new regulations that in a time of war, emergency or maneuvers provided for the organization of \\"special air groups\\" (t≈çkusetsu k≈çk≈´tai), which could be designated either by a place or by a numerical designation. They could be either land- or carrier- based, but in general they were largely land-based and would be given numerical designations. In most cases the basis of these formations were created from elements drawn from existing air groups. The first such unit was the 11th Air Group, established briefly in 1936. While regulations establishing land-based air groups were set forth in 1916 and 1919, it was not until the early 1930s that a series of regulations and instructions, set forth the specific internal organizations of air groups, their locations, functions, and their training, though these changed from time to time right up to the end of the Pacific War. In November 1936, the IJN arranged for the organization of special combined air groups (t≈çkusetsu reng≈ç k≈çk≈´tai), which were composed of two or more air groups. They were created in order to provide greater air strength under a single command. The 1st and 2nd combined air groups were formed in July 1937, at the beginning of the China War, and were the backbone of the navy's air operations in the first several years of that conflict. Standing combined air groups (j≈çsetsu reng≈ç k≈çkutai) intended to be more permanent, were established in December 1938. Two of these were established before the Pacific War: the 11th was organized in December 1938, and the 12th which was formed in 1939. Until the very end of the 1930s most k≈çkutai were composed of a mix of aircraft types, with seaplanes predominating initially, but with carrier-type fighters, dive bombers, and torpedo bombers increasing in numbers, along with land-based twin engined medium bombers. However, by 1941 the IJN's land-based air groups were almost always composed of one type of aircraft, the exception was the Chitose air group which was based in Micronesia and was composed of both medium bombers and fighters. On November 1, 1942, all land-based identified with base names were given numerical designations. As the war in the Pacific progressed, this structure lacked flexibility and hampered front-line operations, consequently, in March 1944 the IJN's land-based air forces were restructured, and certain hik≈çtai were given independent numerical designations and an identity of their own outside the parent K≈çk≈´tai.

Wagner coined the name Kafralu by combining the name of his wife (Katherine) with the names of his sons (Frank and Louis). Wagner built cottages on the island, which were used by his family and others during the summer months for hunting, fishing, and vacations. Kafralu island was connected to Cedar Point in the 1930s and was sold to the Cedar Point Company after Wagner died in 1941. Today the island can still be seen while traveling the Cedar Point Causeway as the large grassy wooded area on the west side.

The product line was expanded to include speedometer cables, carburetor repair parts, shock-absorber parts, and fuel pumps. In 1950 Standard introduced the Hygrade System, simplified carburetor kits for tune-ups and light overhauls. Standard Motor Products had its Initial public offering in 1960 and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1977. In 1963 it entered the wholesale parts market with a new subsidiary, Marathon Parts. Beginning in the late 1960s under Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Sills, Fife's grandson, Standard acquired several rival businesses. In July 1997 it exchanged its brake business for Cooper Industries' temperature control business. The company funded acquisitions by taking out loans and selling stock; less than 10% remains family-owned. In the financial crisis of the late 2000s, the company had to retrench and sold its headquarters building for $40.6 million. The space was previously a manufacturing site producing items like distributor caps, but because of modern engine designs the workforce there dwindled over the years. The remaining Long Island City manufacturing operations were moved to its plant in Reynosa, Mexico, and Independence, Kansas. On July 29, 2009 Chairman Sills rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the company's 90th anniversary. In January 2014, the company acquired the assets of Pensacola Fuel Injection. Operations and products The company has two operational segments, an Engine Management segment that produces parts for fuel systems, ignition and emissions, ignition wires, and battery cables, and a Temperature Control Segment that manufactures and refurbishes air- conditioning, heating, engine cooling system, and windshield washer parts, air-conditioning compressors, and power window accessories. Its subsidiaries include Four Seasons Europe S.A.R.L. (in France), Marathon Auto Parts and Products, Inc., Motortronics, Inc., SMP Motor Products Limited (in Canada), Standard Motor Products Holdings Limited (in England and Wales), Standard Motor Products (Hong Kong) Limited, and Standard Motor Products de Mexico. The company sells to automotive stores and wholesalers. It manufactures approximately half of the parts it sells; most of the rest it imports from China. Some Standard products are sold under private labels, including CARQUEST, Cold Power, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Import Direct, Master Pro, Mileage Plus, Murray, and NAPA (NAPA Belden, NAPA Echlin, NAPA Temp Products). The company's own brands include Standard, BWD/NIEHOFF, Intermotor, OEM, LockSmart, TechSmart, and GP Sorensen for engine management and Four Seasons, Factory Air, EVERCO, ACi, Imperial, COMPRESSORWORKS, TORQFLO, and Hayden for temperature control. Sales Standard Motor Products was listed as one of Crain's New York Business top 250 publicly held companies for 2012, (fee required) and as number 94 in the Forbes list of America's best small companies in 2013. That year the company's earnings were $969 million with 4% sales growth and 61% earnings per share growth. The company also received a positive review that year for its cash conversion cycle from an analyst at The Motley Fool.

History Plaza del Carmen Mall has been opened to the public since the 1970. During the 1980s, it hosted such stores and establishments as a Gonz√°lez Pad√≠n department store (which anchored the mall), Western Auto, Kay Bee Toys, a video game arcade and a music store. Amigo Supermarkets opened their first location in Caguas at Plaza del Carmen Mall in 1989. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, despite the opening of the Amigo Supermarkets store, the mall looked desolated. This was in part due to Gonzalez Padin's closing of their location at the mall, which was followed by other stores. However, the mall has been able to rebound economically. Plaza del Carmen Mall had at different times hosted some of Puerto Rico's most popular television shows, particularly more so during the early 1980s, when Tommy Muniz broadcast some of his shows on Canal 7 live from the mall. More recently, early in 2014, WAPA-TV's El Tiempo Es Oro was shown live from Plaza del Carmen Mall. Due to the year of its opening Plaza del Carmen Mall was once one of the three largest malls in Puerto Rico, smaller only to Plaza Las Americas in San Juan, Plaza Carolina in Carolina and later to San Patricio Plaza in Guaynabo. Now ranks among the smallest malls in the island. The Subway restaurant at Plaza del Carmen closed after it was destroyed by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, and reopened in August 2018.

During its first term it produced three reports to government on the 'State of Natural Capital'. It has called on the Office for National Statistics to integrate the state of the country's natural assets (also known as natural capital) into mainstream national accounting. Having fulfilled its initial remit, the UK NCC ceased activity in March 2015, but was reformed by the new 2015 conservative government with modified Terms of Reference and a brief to continue for the life of that current parliament (i.e. up to 2020). History The NCC was set up as an independent advisory Committee following a key UK Government Natural Environment White Paper commitment in 2011. It initially had a three-year term and formally reported to the Economic Affairs Committee, which is chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In November 2012, the Secretary of State for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson, described his ambition for the natural environment and how the work of the Committee fits into this. In a speech to the Royal Society he said: ‚ÄúI do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. I want us to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC‚Äôs innovative work is geared towards‚Äù. In 2015 the new UK Government announced that the Natural Capital Committee would be continued at least until the end of the current parliament and that its terms of reference would be reviewed. In December 2015 it reappointed Professor Dieter Helm as its chair, with new members to be appointed early in 2016. Role and Purpose Between 2012 and 2015 the NCC's role was broadly to advise the UK Government on how to ensure England's ‚Äònatural wealth‚Äô is managed efficiently and sustainably, thereby unlocking opportunities for sustained prosperity and well-being. The Committee had three Terms of Reference: # to provide advice on when, where and how natural assets are being used unsustainably; # to advise Government on how it should prioritise action to protect and improve natural capital, so that public and private activity is focused where it will have greatest impact on improving well-being in our society; and, # to advise the Government on research priorities to improve future advice and decisions on protecting and enhancing natural capital. The NCC's main form of advice to Government was in the form of annual reports to Government, containing a series of recommendations on what needs to be done to put the economy on a sustainable footing (as far as the environment is concerned). In addition, the Committee was also involved in developing natural capital accounting, both at the national and corporate levels. It worked with the UK's Office for National Statistics and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help incorporate natural capital into the national accounts. At a corporate level, the Committee developed and tested a new framework for corporate natural capital accounting to go alongside traditional financial accounts. The aim of this project was to work with a small group of organisations to pilot corporate natural capital accounts, then use the lessons learned to produce high level guidance and a template account for other organisations to follow and implement. It would also use the lessons from this work to inform its own advice to Government. The Committee also provided ad hoc advice to Government when requested. As of April 2014, it had given advice on forestry, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and biodiversity offsetting. In line with its third Term of Reference, the UK NCC produced an advice paper to Government on research priorities. This identified what needs to be done in order to fill the gaps in our knowledge and understanding of natural capital. State of Natural Capital Reports Between 2012 and 2015 the NCC's advice mainly took the form of annual reports to Government. It produced its first report in spring 2013 and its second in March 2014. The third State of Natural Capital report was published in January 2015. First State of Natural Capital Report The first report set out a framework for what the NCC thought was needed. This was: to measure and value natural capital in order to better manage it. It highlighted that better management of natural capital can produce economic and wellbeing benefits. Second State of Natural Capital Report The second report contained three key messages: # Some assets are currently not being used sustainably. The benefits we derive from them are at risk, and this has significant economic implications; # There are substantial economic benefits to be gained from maintaining and improving natural assets. The benefits will be maximised if their full value is incorporated into all decision-making; and, # A long-term plan is necessary to maintain and improve natural capital, thereby delivering well-being and economic growth. To arrive at the first key message, the Committee began identifying those assets that are at risk and record them in a risk register. Perhaps the main message of its second report was the recommendation to establish a 25-year plan for restoring the country's key natural assets. Government responded to the recommendations of the second report in October 2014. Third State of Natural Capital Report was published by the Natural Capital Committee in January 2015. It recommended that Government should develop a strategy, action plan and investment programme to protect and improve natural capital within a generation. Government gave its response to the third NCC report in September 2015 and later that month the NCC responded with its final advice to government of its initial three-year term. Second term reports to government The fourth report on the state of natural capital to the Economic Affairs Committee was published in January 2017. It recognised that, despite the UK Government's pledge to be \\"the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than that in which it was found\\", many elements of the environment were still in decline. Key recommendations: *The government's 25 Year Environment Plan should be speedily progressed and put on a statutory footing. *Accountability for and governance of the 25 Year Environment Plan should be assigned to a specific lead organisation, and should contain ambitious, long-term, measurable targets. *Government 'Pioneer' projects are key to the Environment Plan's success. *An investment programme in natural capital is necessary if the 25 Year Environment Plan is to deliver, and levels of investment should be linked to the net benefits they deliver. *The government should promote natural capital valuation and accounting in both the private sector and public sector. *The 25 Year Environment Plan should be a key element of development of British agricultural policy, post Brexit and be consistent with the needs of preserving and enhancing natural capital. *The Environment Plan should create and enhance new wildlife areas and corridors in collaboration with a wide range of landholders. *The National Infrastructure Commission should include maintenance and recovery of natural capital in its own long-term plans. *Local authorities and major infrastructure providers should ensure natural capital is protected and enhanced (a reinforcement of Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006). *Consideration should be given to establishing new National Parks in England; they should have extended powers to measure and value the key natural capital assets in their area. *Natural capital approaches to managing biodiversity within river catchments should be encouraged by OFWAT. *The Office for National Statistics (ONS) should further develop national natural capital accounting procedures, and include renewable assets and maintenance costs in its figures. *There must be consistency between the government's Climate Change Committee recommendations and the 25 Year Environment Plan. The 4th report identified its own work priorities for 2017 as: *Production of a ‚ÄòHow To Do It‚Äô guide, based on best practice; *Production of advice on natural capital valuation under various conditions; *Publish advice on determining targets and outcomes for the 25 Year Environment Plan; *Carry on working with ONS and Defra to develop national natural capital accounting methods for land managers. NCC Members Dieter Helm, chair of the UK Natural Capital Committee The Committee is chaired by Professor Dieter Helmhttp://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/committee-chairman --dieter-helm.html and supported by a small, full-time secretariat. Between 2012-2015 the Committee members were all from academia and business with expertise and experience in ecology and environmental science, economics and business. These were: Giles Atkinson, Ian Bateman, Rosie Hails, Kerry ten Kate, Georgina Mace, Colin Mayer, Robin Smale. In February 2016 the UK Government appointed new members of the NCC. These are: *Ian Bateman, Professor of Environmental Economics, University of Exeter; Director of the Land, Environment, Economics and Policy (LEEP) Institute. *Diane Coyle, Professor of Economics, University of Manchester. *Paul Leinster, Professor of Environmental Assessment, Cranfield University; formerly Chief Executive of the Environment Agency. *Georgina Mace, Professor of Biodiversity and Ecosystems at UCL; Director of the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research (CBER). *Colin Mayer, Professor of Management Studies at Sa√Ød Business School, University of Oxford. *Kathy Willis, Professor of Biodiversity, University of Oxford; Director of Science at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Criticism of Natural Capital Committee Guardian columnist, George Monbiot, has been an outspoken critic of the work of the Natural Capital Committee and of other similar attempts to put a monetary value on natural capital assets and the free ecosystem services they provide. In a speech referring to a recent NCC report which suggested that better protection of the UK's freshwater ecosystems would yield an enhancement in aesthetic value of ¬£700m, he accused the NCC of 'trying to compare things which cannot be directly compared'. He went on to say: Others have defended the efforts of the Natural Capital Committee to integrate the valuation of natural capital into national and local economic decision-making, arguing that it puts the environment on a more equal footing when weighed against other commercial pressures, and that valuation is not the same as monetisation.

In this picture, theories are classified in terms of their \\"chromatic levels\\"; i.e., the heights of the formal groups that define the theories via the Landweber exact functor theorem. Typical theories it studies include: complex K-theory, elliptic cohomology, Morava K-theory and tmf.  Chromatic convergence theorem  In algebraic topology, the chromatic convergence theorem states the homotopy limit of the chromatic tower (defined below) of a finite p-local spectrum X is X itself. The theorem was proved by Hopkins and Ravenel. = Statement = Let L_{E(n)} denotes the Bousfield localization with respect to the Morava E-theory and let X be a finite, p-local spectrum. Then there is a tower associated to the localizations :\\\\cdots \\\\rightarrow L_{E(2)} X \\\\rightarrow L_{E(1)} X \\\\rightarrow L_{E(0)} X called the chromatic tower, such that its homotopy limit it homotopic to the original spectrum X. The stages in the tower above are often simplifications of the original spectrum. For example, L_{E(0)} X is the rational localization and L_{E(1)} X is the localization with respect to p-local K-theory.  Stable homotopy groups  In particular, if the p-local spectrum X is the spectrum of the stable p-local sphere spectrum \\\\mathbb{S}_{(p)}, then the homotopy limit of this sequence is the original p-local sphere spectrum. This is a key observation for studying stable homotopy groups of spheres using chromatic homotopy theory.

He is the co-founder of Headspace, alongside Richard Pierson, a digital health company that provides guided meditation training and mindfulness for its users. Puddicombe is a former Buddhist monk with a degree in Circus Arts. Early life and education Puddicombe was born in London but grew up in Bristol, UK. He attended Wellsway Comprehensive School in Keynsham, and studied Sports Science at De Montfort University. He also achieved a Foundation Degree in Circus Arts. Career =Buddhism= In 1994, Puddicombe gave up his studies in sports science and instead travelled to Asia to train as a Buddhist monk. He has attributed this in part to an effort to cope with the trauma of bereavement. His meditation training took him to India, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Australia and Russia; culminating in full ordination at a Tibetan monastery in India, in the Himalayas. Having completed a one-year cloistered retreat in Scotland, he returned to Russia, where he taught meditation in Moscow for four years before reaching the end of his monastic commitment. In 2004 Puddicombe returned to the UK where he studied Circus Arts in London while simultaneously building his own private meditation practice in the city, wanting to make \\"meditation and mindfulness accessible, relevant and beneficial to as many people as possible\\". =Meditation consultant= Puddicombe set up a private meditation practice in 2006, and spent the next four years working as a mindfulness consultant, while adapting the language and techniques he had previously learned. During this time he met his future business partner and co-founder of Headspace, Rich Pierson. Puddicombe has often attributed the success of Headspace to Pierson's involvement. =Headspace= Headspace launched in 2010, originally as an events company in London. Its first online meditations were uploaded to its website before, in January 2012, the first Headspace app was launched. The shared mission of both Andy Puddicombe and Richard Pierson was straightforward: to demystify meditation and to make it more accessible, more relevant to the modern-day world, and more creatively engaging. Writing Puddicombe has written three books, all published by Hodder & Stoughton, Hachette. * Get Some Headspace (2011) is an in-depth introduction to the Headspace techniques. (also published as Meditation and Mindfulness) * The Headspace Diet (2013) teaches readers how to use mindfulness rather than fad-diets to reach their ideal personal weight. (also published as Mindful Eating) * The Headspace Guide to...a Mindful Pregnancy (2015) sets out to teach couples how to calmly navigate the anxieties and demands of pregnancy. Puddicombe is a regular contributor to The Guardian, The Times, Five Books and Huffington Post, writing about the benefits of mindfulness. Television and radio In 2013, Puddicombe was featured on the BBC science documentary, Horizon 'The Truth About Personality', in which the Headspace app was tested for efficacy. In laboratory experiments carried out over 7 weeks, the BBC Presenter, Dr Michael Mosley, experienced progressively less negative thought, whilst overcoming more than a decade of insomnia. Puddicombe contributes to BBC News and BBC Radio on matters of meditation, mindfulness, mental health and lifestyle. In 2010 he took part in the Pause For Thought series on BBC Radio 2, with weekly appearances on the Chris Evans radio show, with over 9 million listeners. This is alongside other contributions to stations such as NPR (National Public Radio) in the US. Puddicombe's first appearance on US TV came in 2013, taking part in the Dr Oz show. He discussed the rise of meditation, the scientific benefits, as well as his personal journey as a Buddhist monk. He then hosted a separate segment in which he taught the studio audience and television viewers how to meditate. He has also appeared on other network shows, such as ABC and KTLA News, discussing the benefits of meditation. In August 2017, Puddicombe was a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. During his appearance, he guided the show's host, The Roots, and the audience through a two minute meditation. TED Talk In November 2012, Puddicombe gave a TED Talk, entitled 'All It Takes Is 10 Mindful Minutes', outlining the benefits of taking time out each day to practise mindfulness. To date it has accrued 10 million views, and was among the first TED Talks to be featured on Netflix. Personal life Puddicombe lives in Venice, Los Angeles, California with his wife and two sons. In 2013, Puddicombe announced that he was receiving treatment for testicular cancer. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, he revealed how mindfulness had helped him to cope with the physical, emotional and mental impact of the illness. In August 2014, Puddicombe was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.

The activists protested the passing of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) by the ruling party Kuomintang (KMT) at the legislature without clause-by-clause review. The Sunflower protesters perceived the trade pact with the People's Republic of China (China; PRC) would hurt Taiwan's economy and leave it vulnerable to political pressure from Beijing, while advocates of the treaty argued that increased Chinese investment would provide a necessary boost to Taiwan's economy, that the still-unspecified details of the treaty's implementation could be worked out favorably for Taiwan, and that to \\"pull out\\" of the treaty by not ratifying it would damage Taiwan's international credibility. The protesters initially demanded the clause-by-clause review of the agreement be reinstated, later changing their demands toward the rejection of the trade pact, the passing of legislation allowing close monitoring of future agreements with China, and citizen conferences discussing constitutional amendment. While the Kuomintang was open to a line-by-line review at a second reading of the agreement, the party rejected the possibility that the pact be returned for a committee review. The KMT backed down later, saying that a joint review committee could be formed if the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) agreed to participate in the proceedings. This offer was rejected by the DPP, who asked for a review committee on all cross-strait pacts, citing \\"mainstream public opinion.\\" In turn, the DPP proposal was turned down by the KMT. The movement marked the first time that the Legislative Yuan had been occupied by citizens.  Name  The term \\"Sunflower Student Movement\\" referred to the use of sunflowers by the protesters as a symbol of hope as the flower is heliotropic. The movement's name in Chinese is (), a calque of the English word \\"sunflower\\", rather than the native term, () This term was popularized after a florist contributed 1000 sunflowers to the students outside the Legislative Yuan building. \\"Sunflower\\" was also an allusion to the Wild Lily Movement of 1990 which set a milestone in the democratization of Taiwan. The movement is also known as the \\"March 18 Student Movement\\" (318Â≠∏ÈÅã) or \\"Occupy Taiwan Legislature\\" (‰ΩîÈ†òÂúãÊúÉ‰∫ã‰ª∂). The movement's anthem was \\"Island's Sunrise\\" by the indie band Fire EX. from Kaohsiung.  Background  On March 17 2014, Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) attempted a unilateral move in the Legislative Yuan to force the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) to the legislative floor without giving it a clause-by-clause review as previously established in a June 2013 agreement with the opposing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Previously, in September 2013, the two parties had agreed to hold 16 public hearings over the details of the trade agreement with academics, NGOs and representatives of trade sectors impacted by the agreement. The KMT had chaired eight public hearings within a week, and several members of social groups, NGOs, and business representatives from impacted industries were either not invited or were informed at the last minute. When academics and business sector representatives gave their opinions at the hearings, the presiding chair of the legislature's Internal Administrative Committee, KMT legislator , said the agreement had to be adopted in its entirety and could not be amended. Legislative gridlock followed, as the opposing DPP had not completed the eight hearings they had agreed to chair by March 17. Chang, citing Article 61 of the Legislative Yuan Functions Act, announced that the review process had gone beyond the 90 days allotted for review. The agreement, in the KMT's view, should therefore be considered reviewed and should be submitted to a plenary session on March 21 for a final vote.  Occupation  = Legislative chamber's occupation = On March 18 around 9:00 p.m. local time, crowds of students, academics, civic organizations, and other protestors climbed over the fence at the legislature and entered the building. In the melee, one window of the Legislative Yuan was smashed and a police officer suffered serious injuries. A lawyer who was assigned to the protesters stated that six individuals had been arrested over the protest so far. While several hundred protesters remained outside the building, about 300 protesters occupied the legislative floor overnight and succeeded in preventing several attempts by police to expel them. The protesters demanded that the clause-by-clause review of the agreement be reinstated, otherwise they vowed to occupy the legislature until March 21, when the Yuan had scheduled to vote and pass the CSSTA. As night approached, the authorities cut water and electricity to the building. Premier Jiang Yi-huah ordered riot police be sent in to evict the protesters, but that directive was not implemented. Shortly after the movement began, thousands of riot police from the National Police Agency were mobilized across the country to surround the protesters. On March 20, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng promised not to use force on the protesters. On March 21, Speaker Wang refused to meet with President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Jiang Yi-huah to discuss a response, stating that the president should listen to the people and that a compromise was needed between the lawmakers first. Premier Jiang met with demonstrators outside the legislature on March 22 but stated that the executive branch had no intention of dropping the trade pact. At a press conference on March 23, President Ma restated his resolve in passing the trade pact and affirmed he did not act according to orders from Beijing. = Executive bureau occupation and eviction = In response to the press conference, a group of protesters led by Dennis Wei stormed and occupied the Executive Yuan around 7:30 p.m. local time on March 23. The protesters were evicted from the Executive Yuan by 5:00 a.m. on March 24, but some congregated again on Zhongxiao East Road. During the 10-hour eviction process, around 1000 riot police and other law enforcement personnel reportedly used excessive force, including water cannon and baton strikes to the head against the nonviolent protesters, while journalists and medics were ordered to leave. More than 150 people were injured and 61 were arrested. The Association of Taiwan Journalists accused the police of using violence against the media during the eviction process and violating freedom of the press, citing more than 10 cases of attacks on media reporters. = Attempted negotiations = On March 25, President Ma invited representatives of the student protests to his office for a dialog over the controversial trade agreement \\"without any preconditions\\", after the president said earlier he would not hold face-to- face talks. One of the student leaders Lin Fei-fan accepted the invitation initially and agreed no preconditions should be set for the meeting, but he said the students wanted to discuss whether Taiwan needed new legislation to monitor all cross-strait agreements, and whether the CSSTA should be postponed until that legislation was introduced. However, one day later, on March 26, the protest leaders rebuffed the invitation to meet despite earlier calling on President Ma to meet with them to answer their demands, as they feel Ma, who was the Chairman of the Kuomintang, was still controlling the Kuomintang legislators via the party regulations, so that the cross-party negotiations failed once again to reach a consensus on the protests and the pact. On March 26, student protesters called for all legislators to support the establishment of a law for supervising cross-strait agreements before passing the recent trade in services pact. The student activists drafted an undertaking document and asked all lawmakers to sign the document to show their approval. = Rally = Protesters near NTU hospital On March 27, Lin Fei-fan called for a March 30 rally filling the Ketagalan Boulevard leading from the Presidential Office to the legislature to put pressure on President Ma to heed the demonstrators' demands. The organizers behind the demonstration said around 500,000 people massed in the March 30 rally, while the police estimated the figure to be 116,000. Twenty-two NGOs also took part in the rally. Hundreds of people opposing the movement held a concurrent rally in the same area, but left before the students dispersed. On April 1, hundreds of pro-China activists supporting the trade pact rallied against the parliament seizure. The group was organized by Chang An-lo, a prominent Taiwanese gang leader also known as \\"White Wolf\\", who was on bail after being arrested on his return to Taiwan from China, where he had fled 17 years previously. He faced charges relating to organized crime.  Resolution  On April 6, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin- pyng visited the occupied parliament chamber and promised to postpone review of the trade pact until legislation monitoring all cross-strait agreements has been passed. However, Fai Hrong-tai, a deputy secretary of the KMT caucus, said at a news conference that Wang should have consulted with the KMT caucus in advance, rather than keeping them in the dark. DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming dismissed the KMT lawmakers' remarks as being a poor excuse to back down, noting that the KMT lawmakers surrounded Wang when the speaker read his announcement and shouted \\"Go, go Taiwan\\" along with Wang after his announcement. According to Presidential Office spokeswoman Garfie Li, President Ma Ying-jeou had no knowledge beforehand of either Wang's Sunday morning visit to protesters at the Legislative Yuan or his promise that the monitoring rules will be implemented before a review, and the president called again for an early passage of the trade pact with China. Premier Jiang Yi-huah has stated that the concessions are not realistic. In response to the April 6 concessions from Speaker Wang, the protesters held a press conference on April 7 stating they would vacate the Legislative Yuan on April 10 at 6 p.m. local time, which they eventually did, and also continue the movement in the broader Taiwan society. President Ma supported the students' decision to leave the legislature. The legislative chamber was fully cleaned by students before they left.  Aftermath  =Legal= On April 21, Lin Fei-fan, Chen Wei-ting, Huang Kuo-chang and four other key members of the Sunflower Movement attended the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office voluntarily to explain what happened during their occupation of the legislature that began on March 18 and the attempted occupation of the Executive Yuan on March 23. Wellington Koo, one of the lawyers accompanying the group, said that, if charged, the defendants would enter a plea of not guilty. The prosecutors said that several protestors stood accused of a number of offenses, such as obstruction of justice. By June 2014, over four hundred people had been investigated for their role in the protest. On July 30, 23 injured protesters filed suit against premier Jiang Yi-huah, National Police Agency Director-General Wang Cho-chiun, Taipei Police Commissioner Huang Sheng-yung and Zhongzheng First Police Precinct Chief Fang Yang-ning on charges of attempted murder, coercion and causing bodily harm. More than one hundred demonstrators massed outside the court, calling for Jiang to resign. Jiang's cabinet also sued 126 protesters involved with the storming of the Executive Yuan. Soon after taking office on May 20, 2016, the Tsai Ing-wen administration and new premier Lin Chuan dropped the charges. In August 2014, a Taichung police officer was given a suspended 3-month prison sentence and fined for making an expletive-filled Facebook post against the protesting students. In May 2015, 39 protesters were charged with trespassing for their role in the occupation of the Executive Yuan. Three months later, the Taipei District Court found that police actions had violated the Act Governing the Use of Police Weapons, and ordered the Taipei City Government to pay NT$30,000 to a protester, Lin Ming-hui. In September, lawyers representing 30 other protesters petitioned Taipei City Government for NT$10 million in damages. Court proceedings against 21 protesters began in June 2016. First to be charged with various offenses included Chen Wei-ting, Huang Kuo-chang, and Lin Fei-fan. The Taiwan High Court found protesters Chen Wei-ting and Tsay Ting-kuei not guilty of obstruction in August. In a March 2017 Taipei District Court decision, Chen, Huang and Lin were acquitted of incitement charges. The Taiwan High Court upheld the lower court's decision in March 2018. In April 2020, the Taiwan High Court overturned previous rulings in a decision that found protesters guilty of incitement, obstruction, theft, and damage of public property. =Political= In a meeting with Taiwanese politician James Soong on May 7, 2014, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping said that economic integration between China and Taiwan was mutually beneficial, would bring positive results for both sides and should not be disturbed. Xi appeared to address the Sunflower Movement indirectly, saying China wanted to know more about the concerns of people in Taiwan. Soong urged Beijing to be more tolerant of Taiwan's centrist and pluralist views. On May 18, Lin Fei-fan, Chen Wei-ting and Huang Kuo-chang formed a new organization, . The organization aims to reform Taiwan's referendum laws and push for legislative review of the CSSTA, along with other cross-strait pacts and economic bills. On May 21, DPP legislators criticized the Mainland Affairs Council for classifying the disadvantages of the trade accord and releasing only information it considers favorable to the agreement. Responding to the questions, Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi said that the classified information was to be used for reference only within the government. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Cho Shih-chao said that research produced by academics is only used for internal reference for decision making. However, neither official explained why only poll numbers favorable to the government's position have been released to the public, while others were not. On June 9, deputy economics minister Woody Duh confirmed that since April, China had frozen negotiations with Taiwan over the merchandise trade agreement originally projected to be signed at the end of 2014. Some observers attributed the freeze to the services pact logjam. The Legislative Yuan held an extraordinary session on June 13 to review the services trade pact and the draft bill to increase scrutiny of future cross-strait agreements. Duh urged the legislature to quickly approve the services trade pact and the new law to increase scrutiny of future agreements to avoid delaying the follow-up merchandise trade deal talks. President Ma called for progress to be made in the session. In an interview for Business Weekly published on June 25, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the United States does not want see Taiwan's independence being threatened or undermined.Hillary Clinton warns against over-dependence on China Pointing to the crisis in Ukraine, she further warned that the loss of economic independence will affect Taiwan's political independence, and that overreliance on China will leave Taiwan vulnerable. While thanking Clinton for reminding Taiwan to act \\"carefully and smartly\\" when dealing with China, the Mainland Affairs Council said Taiwan's steady promotion of exchanges with China had not led to over-dependence on China, and that Taiwan had not lost economic and political independence. In August 2014, leaders of the student movement visited the United States, meeting with the US Congress, Department of State and the American Institute in Taiwan. The delegation of students led by Lin Fei-fan reiterated their rejection of the one China policy, further commenting that if Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, students would protest again. Lin stressed that the movement was not controlled by either the Kuomintang or Democratic Progressive Party. Chen Wei- ting and Huang Kuo-chang both called the movement a \\"third force\\" in the politics of Taiwan. The KMT suffered heavy setbacks in the 2014 local elections and the 2016 general elections.China's Xi calls for \\"equal\\" political talks with Taiwan On July 23, 2015, a related protest occurred, as the Ministry of Education was stormed by Anti Black Box Movement protesters. New Power Party In 2015, the New Power Party emerged from the Sunflower Movement, advocating universal human rights, civil and political liberties, as well as Taiwan independence.New Power Party Platform(Chinese)Taiwan's newest politicians include a rock star and an aboriginal activist In the 2016 Legislative Yuan election, Freddy Lim, one of the party's founders, defeated incumbent Kuomintang legislator Lin Yu-fang in the Zhongzheng‚ÄìWanhua constituency. =Zhang Zhijun visit= To rebuild cross- strait ties after the Sunflower Movement protests, China's Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun arrived in Taiwan on June 25 for a four-day visit as part of the 2014 Wang-Zhang Meeting. Zhang met with his Taiwanese counterpart, Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi at the Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel, with groups of protesters held back by police cordons. Zhang and Wang agreed to establish a direct communication mechanism heralded as the first of its kind, which allows concerned officials from both sides to cut through the bureaucracy and make direct calls to discuss important matters. During the visit, Zhang mentioned he wanted to hear different voices from the ground, but no meetings had been scheduled with leaders of the Sunflower Movement. Instead, Zhang met with a pre-selected group of students. Before Zhang's arrival on June 25, the Novotel hotel had also been the scene for an incident which was condemned by the Taiwan Association for Human Rights. After members of protest organizations booked a room at the hotel, police and hotel staff reportedly entered the room without authorization and demanded the guests check out immediately. Hotel management said in a statement that the number of people staying in the room did not correspond with the number registered at the reception. The extra guests were seen moving around inside the hotel, and calls for an explanation remained unanswered, the hotel said. The activists later complained they had been unlawfully detained in their room after the forced entry, with no water or food allowed into the room. When Zhang arrived at a casual meeting with Wang Yu-chi at Sizihwan Sunset Beach Resort in Xiziwan, Gushan District on June 27 around 8:10 pm, protesters organized by Taiwan Solidarity Union and Black Island National Youth Front greeted the motorcade by spraying white paint and throwing ghost money, shouting slogans such as \\"One Country on Each Side\\" and \\"Zhang Zhijun get out of here\\". The white paint did not hit Zhang but did hit his body guards. In August 2014, a reporter who covered the Zhang visit sued police over an alleged infringement of press freedom. He claimed to be there covering the protest and did not take part, but was still barred from recording the scene after showing his press credentials.  Reactions  =In Taiwan= Activists representation of CSSTA More than 200 professors and industry experts issued joint statements and held panel discussions warning the national security risks raised in the opening of the type II telecommunication services outlined in the trade pact. The National Communications Commission denies the liberalization of the telecommunication services would pose security threats. On March 21, a group of presidents from the 52-member Associations of national universities of Taiwan issued a joint statement calling on President Ma Ying-jeou to respond to the student-led protesters' demands, and urged Ma to engage in talks with student protest leaders as soon as possible to defuse the situation. 25 of 34 professors at the National Taiwan University Mathematics Department also issued another statement declaring their support for the protesting students and the public, stating that: > We are not against the signing of the service trade agreement per se, since > we do live in a world being swept by globalization, but the signing and > review processes must be transparent and executed with due process. This is > why we support what the students are demanding, which is rejecting any > agreement signed 'in a black box. The statement also criticized remarks made earlier by a high-ranking Ministry of Economic Affairs official, who described the agreement as \\"beneficial to the students because after its implementation, they can work in China and earn NT$52,000 a month, rather than [the] NT$22,000 [they would make in Taiwan].\\" In the statement, the professors also asked if \\"sending [Taiwan's] educated youth to China for work [was] the government's only solution for the nation's low wage and wealth gap problems.\\" The National Alliance of Parents Organization issued a statement on March 22 that supported the students, called for dialog, and praised the students' civic consciousness. Multiple Taiwanese entertainers, including Deserts Chang, Giddens Ko, and Lin Cheng- sheng criticized the government's eviction of students from the Executive Yuan. On March 22, Premier Jiang Yi-huah met with protesters but declined to withdraw the deal or agree to legislation monitoring future cross-strait agreements, saying that the two issues required the involvement of the Executive Yuan and President Ma Ying-jeou. Jiang stated that there is no need to enact new laws monitoring cross-strait agreements since \\"the governing party the Kuomintang has already proposed measures pertaining to the monitoring of such agreements by the legislature and the public that are supported by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng. Therefore, there is no need for new legislation.\\" On March 23, in a speech addressing the students, President Ma Ying-jeou applauded the students but questioned their decision to occupy government offices, asking: > Is this the sort of democracy we want? Must the rule of law be sacrificed in > such a manner? Do we not take pride in our democracy and our respect for > rule of law? The students' association at National Taiwan University called for an education strike, so students could attend protests without disciplinary action from the school. Alumni of the university petitioned for the resignation of Premier Jiang Yi-huah, a former professor there. The sociology departments at National Tsing Hua University and National Taipei University canceled classes in response to the protests. Later, the sociology department of National Sun Yat-Sen University followed suit. In total, 45 student organizations from 18 universities backed the call to strike. The (ROCCOC) held a press conference with representatives from 50 impacted service industries on March 26 to express their support for the trade pact. There are 122 associations covering more than 100,000 businesses within ROCCOC. Approximately 85 percent of ROCCOC's members might be impacted by the cross- strait pact. ROCCOC chairman Lai Chang-yi said Taiwan should not be afraid of competing with global businesses. By establishing bases in China, he stated, Taiwan's businesses have the opportunity to globalize. The Bankers Association of the Republic of China (BAROC) held a supervisors and management meeting on March 27, and the chairman of BAROC Lee Jih-Chu on behalf of all members of BAROC issued three statements to support the trade pact after the meeting. The Ministry of Economic Affairs held presentations explaining the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement at multiple universities across northern Taiwan. Some protesters feared the agreement would eventually result in the absorption of Taiwan by China, mirroring the accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation. In a speech to the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce on June 10, Premier Jiang Yi-huah criticized the movement, saying protestors were people who \\"complain all day long about the government\\" and \\"blame others for their failures.\\" =In China= China's state-run Xinhua News Agency criticized the student-led protests for being violent. =Other countries= Sunflower Movement supporters in Los Angeles, California On March 24, the U.S. State Department commented on the issue, saying that the U.S. hopes discussions on the trade pact can be carried out civilly and peacefully. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, who is a founding member of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, urged Ma to ensure a non-violent, peaceful resolution: > My thoughts are with Taiwanese students and other protesters expressing > opposition to a proposed economic pact with China. The world is watching > these courageous students. The message to President Ma is that when you try > to jam a trade agreement through, people will resist. Amnesty International issued a statement on March 19 urging restraint in the police response. Overseas Taiwanese in the United States and the United Kingdom have demonstrated in support of the student movement. On March 29 and 30, rallies were held in 49 cities in 21 countries to show support for the Sunflower Movement. The BBC commented that this movement could be a further democratization of Taiwan, with additional safeguards to let the people, not any political party, decide the fate of Taiwan. Polish media group Niezalezna ‚Äì which owns several print and online news outlets in Poland, including the daily Gazeta Polska Codziennie, the weekly Gazeta Polska and the monthly Nowe Panstwo ‚Äî received a letter from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Bureau in Poland, protesting its use of an analogy between the occupation of the Executive Yuan compound by protesters and the consequent violent crackdown by police and the occupation of the central square, Maidan, in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, by protesters who were also treated brutally by the police. Hanna Shen, the journalist who wrote the story and other reports about the movement, expressed shock about receiving the letter: > My newspaper has been publishing articles very critical of the governments > of Russia, China and the former Ukrainian government, but we never received > any letter from the representative offices of those countries asking us to > retract anything. I personally think this letter, as an attempt to > influence, to control the way media in free and democratic Poland writes > about Taiwan, is not acceptable. [M]any media outlets around the world ‚Äì > including in Germany and in the US ‚Äì have also made the same analogy in > their reports. Tang Prize recipient Yu Ying-shih expressed support for the movement in a speech on September 20, 2014. He lauded the students' intentions and further commented that all citizens of a democracy should make their concerns known and vote.

It has been identified as Zranka/Zarin, the capital of the satrapy of Zranka/Drangiana. Geography The archeological site known as Dahan-e Gholaman or Dahaneh-e Gholaman (\\"Gateway of the Slaves\\") is located some 30 km southeast of the modern city of Zabol on a neck of land separating two of the modern Chah Nimeh reservoirs, about 8.5 km from the nearest point on the Iran- Afghanistan border.Gnoli (1993); the site's location can be verified on satellite maps at the specified coordinates. Archeology Dahan-e Gholaman is the largest Achaemenid site in all of eastern Iran.Mohammadkhani (2012) 1. Some 27 structures aligned roughly in a straight line running SW to NE along the northern edge of the site were excavated by the Italian archeologist U. Scerrato in 1962-1965 and by the Iranian archeologist S. M. S. Sajjadi in 2000‚Äì2005. Further geophysical and surface exploration in 2007-2011 revealed the outline of another monumental building situated 2 km south of the northern complex of buildings.Mohammadkhani (2012) 1-2, 5-8. Several of the larger structures excavated or detected at Dahan-e Gholaman have regular rectangular or square plans and bear comparison with the palatial buildings and audience halls of the Achaemenid royal residences at Pasargadae and Persepolis, as well as Dasht-e Gohar.Gnoli (1993); Mohammadkhani (2012) 8-16. One of the structures has been identified as a religious building, its three altars possibly dedicated to the leading Persian gods Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra.Gnoli (1993). Identification and History The size of the site, unparalleled in eastern Iran, and the characteristic layout of its public structures indicate that it served as a significant Achaemenid administrative center. Consequently, Dahan-e Gholaman has been identified as the capital of the Achaemenid province of Zranka/Drangiana.Scerrato (1966) 11; Gnoli (1993). As such, the site's ancient name was also probably Zranka or, a variation, Zarin.Gnoli (1993); Talbert (2000) 3 H3. The site's features exhibit parallels to those attested in the reign of Darius I (522-486 BC), which would match the expected overall time-frame for its construction.Gnoli (1993). The absence of stratigraphy at the site suggests a relatively short period of urban habitation,Gnoli (1993). and it probably did not survive much beyond the Achaemenid period (c. 550-330 BC). In particular, if the identification with the capital of Zranka/Drangiana is correct, the site would have been visited by Alexander the Great during his pursuit of the usurper Bessos and his conquest of the region in the winter of 330-329 BC.Schmitt (1995). After the decline and abandonment of Dahan-e Gholaman, the administrative center of the region was transferred 31 km to the northeast, to NƒÅd-i \`Alƒ´ in what is now Afghanistan, which was called Zaranj (or Zarang) in the Middle Ages.Schmitt (1995). The name has since been transferred, yet again, to the modern city of Zaranj in Afghanistan, located 4.4 km south of medieval Zaranj (NƒÅd-i \`Alƒ´) and 28 km northeast of ancient Zranka (Dahan-e Gholaman).

Classified as a historic monument in 1911, restored from 1993 to 1995, the chapel has pinnacles where certain newly created chimeras resemble products of American film culture and Japanese animation.  History  The sacred origins of the place surround a spring, close to which the Druids held Beltane ceremonies in order to celebrate fertility. In the Middle Ages, Christianity replaced the Druids and established Notre-Dame de Bethl√©em (Our Lady of Bethlehem).La chapelle de Bethl√©em, Boistel Council (fr) However, the sculptures on the west opening are directly from the Druidic cult. The chapel has been classified as a historic monument since August 30, 1911.Notice no. PA00108800, Base M√©rim√©e, minist√®re fran√ßais de la Culture(fr) = Restoration of the pinnacles = During the restoration of the chapel from 1993 to 1995, the question arose about how to replace the missing pinnacles at the corners of the building. The only sources available, a drawing and a note from the Archaeological Society of Loire-Atlantique, date from the nineteenth century and details are not allowed to be revealed. The French architect, Gw√©nol√© Congard, asked the sculptor Jean-Louis Boistel to recreate these pinnacles, including the 28 chimeras that adorn the corners.Estuaire, newsletter #19 (fr) Each chimera was created based on the symbolic meaning behind each pinnacle. Jean-Louis Boistel combines ideals of mythology, Christianity and also the modern era to recreate a coherent, iconographic program. The chimeras are as follows: * north-west pinnacle, symbolizing the soul of man: ** a wild boar (tracking the spiritual) ** a centaur (conflicts between instinct and reason) ** Sainte Anne at anchor (firmness, solidity, tranquility, fidelity), ** Adam * Archivolt, showing the tree of life * west pinnacle, symbolizing the soul of woman: ** Eve ** a triad (Alma, Dahud and Malgwen), ** a Siren (lust), ** a snake (the world of fantasy and mystery) * south-west pinnacle, symbolizing the unconscious; ** Goldorak (righteousness, a knight of modern times) ** A Gremlin (evil monster) ** Gizmo (a good monster) ** Irony (arrogance of man) * south pinnacle, symbolizing wisdom: ** the crazy (poetry) ** the druid (science, wisdom and strength), ** the Templar (guardian of the temple, and core values) ** the contractor (knowledge and understanding); * South-east pinnacle, of memory ** The Angel of Saint Matthew ** The Bull of Saint Luke ** The Eagle of Saint John ** The Lion of Saint Mark * North-east pinnacle, of origins ** a skinned man (the resurrection) ** the old man (the ages of man and eternity) ** Ankou (Death) ** Leviathan (absolute nothingness, that which does not wake) depicted as a Xenomorph from the film Alien The proposal to the council of Saint-Jean-de- Boiseau did not win unanimously, but the project was validated through the support of the town's youth. The pinnacles were completed in September 1995. The chapel was the subject of an installation of Gino de Dominicis, D'Lo, in the festival Estuaire 2009.  Architecture  The chapel is made up of a main rectangular body facing west. The archivolt to the west represents the tree of life. To the south an avant-corps is built beside the road.

Especially known for its small, lightweight and robust engines, the engines are mainly used in all kinds of small construction machinery, for generators or pumps Small engines Small engine#HistoryHatz Company Profile on OEM Off-Highway Magazine  History  Historical Hatz tractor model TL13 Founded in 1880 by Mathias Hatz, the company began to build engines in 1904. In 1910, Hatz began to produce hot bulb engines for stationary use. Based on that engine, the first Hatz water-cooled diesel engine, the H-series, was developed (max. power: 6 kW; engine speed: 500 rpm; weight: 430 kg).Gottfried Hatz, Motorenfabrik Hatz GmbH & Co. KG (publisher): Hatz Chronicle, Four Generations of Engine Production, Eberl Medien GmbH & Co. KG, Immenstadt 2008, Three years later, a new plant was built at the present location and Hatz started to export engines to South America. In 1936, a two stroke engine with horizontal cylinder layout, the L2, which was especially intended for the use by the construction industry (max. power: 8 kW; engine speed: 1100 rpm; weight: 360 kg) was developed. In 1950, the first agricultural tractors were presented by Hatz.Traktorenlexikon Wikibooks (German language) Another three years later, the first Hatz air-cooled four-stroke diesel engine was introduced, the E80 (max. power 7.5 kW; engine speed: 2000 rpm: 140 kg) which went on sale worldwide. The first high-revving diesel engine which had a housing made of light alloy, the E75 (max. power 3.5 kW), was produced from 1958 onwards. This engine, which weighed just 50 kg and ran with an engine speed of up to 3000 rpm, was the basis of the worldwide success of Hatz. In 1966, Hatz introduced the world's smallest industrial diesel engine, the E671 (max. power 2.6 kW, engine speed: 3600 rpm; weight: 34 kg). Two years later, the production of more quite small diesel engines was launched. With the ‚ÄúSilentPack‚Äù, a capsuled air-cooled engine which went on sale in 1978, the noise emission was reduced by 90% in comparison to a similar uncapsuled engine. At the time of the 100th anniversary of the company, the Motorenfabrik Hatz had approx. 950 employees. A compact two-cylinder engine, the 2G30 (max. power 15 kW; engine speed: 3000 rpm; weight: 85 kg) was introduced in 1986. Two years later, Hatz began with contract-manufacturing of automotive components like conrods, crankshafts, rocker arms, etc. Today, several million parts are produced for the automotive, agricultural and motorcycle industry. The B-series engines, which are still the engines with the highest production volume today, were developed and introduced in the 1990s. Engines with vertical crankshaft followed shortly later. In the 1990s, the fabrication of newly developed products started, for example the air-cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of the series 1B with vertical shaft. Due to their low weight, Hatz diesel engines are also mounted in motorcycles. The motorbike manufacturer Sommer based in Eppstein uses the one-cylinder four-stroke Hatz diesel engine 1B40 (462 cm¬≥, 8 kW/11 PS) for retrofitting of the Indian motorbike series Royal Enfield.Sommer Diesel - Hatz driven diesel motorcycle Sommer Motorradmanufaktur.  Products  1D42 1B27 The product portfolio of Motorenfabrik Hatz comprises 3 business fields: manufacture of diesel engines, of systems and components for the automotive and commercial vehicle industry. = Diesel engines = The product portfolio of Hatz Diesel currently includes six engine series in a power range from 1.5 to 56 kW. Since 2014 a new water- cooled engine, the H-series, is on sale.  B-series  With the slogan ‚ÄúThe challenger‚Äú, the HATZ 1B-series was presented in 1996, showing a number of technical highlights. In a minimum of space, all the important functional components of the engine such as decompression device, injection pump drive, oil pump with oil pump pressure regulator, valve train system for inlet and outlet valve, governor, speed control lever with governor spring and the multi-functional mechanical control system are integrated in the governor housing. Due to these technical features, the B-series scores with a light- weight and compact design. Depending on their cylinder capacity, the air- cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of B-series are available at power ranges from 1.5 to 7.6 kW and a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. Furthermore, models with vertical or horizontal crankshaft are available. The B-series complies with the strict requirements of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.  D-series  The D-series, also referred to as SUPRA offers an even more robust design than the B-series. Therefore, the air-cooled one- cylinder diesel engines of this series are frequently mounted in compaction machines but are also used for other application fields such as generating sets for example. They have a power range of 3.5 to 15.2 kW at a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. The maximum torque is at 40.7 Nm. The SUPRA series particularly excels in its high running smoothness. This is achieved by a new design of the balance weights as well as the optimum use of two counter-rotating balance shafts and consequently a 100% first-order counterbalance.SAE Paper: SUPRA - The New Single-Cylinder Air-Cooled Diesel from Hatz On demand, the engine may be equipped with the patented SILENT PACK ¬©, which reduces the noise emission by up to 90%. In addition, the engines of the D-series have up to 4 power take-off possibilities at the crank-shaft respectively auxiliary drives. Similar to the B-series, the engine is also available in a horizontal or vertical version. Furthermore, the D-series complies with the strict requirements of the EPA(Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.  G-series  The G-series is notable for its low weight and ease of maintenance. The air-cooled two-cylinder diesel engine has a power range of 9.8 to 17 kW at a maximum speed of 3600 rpm and a maximum torque of 53.6 Nm. The cylinders are vertically located and may be exchanged individually. The crankcase is made of aluminium alloy. The engines of the G-series comply with the requirements of EPA(Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.  M-series  The M-series comprises the Hatz engines with the highest performance. Performance data of the air-cooled two-, three- or four- cylinder engines are available for a power range of 15 to 56 kW at a maximum speed of up to 3000 rpm. The maximum torque of the 4-cylinder version is 219.6 Nm. Due to the air-cooling, the engine may be operated under any climatic conditions and assures high operation reliability. In addition, the system scores with better ease of maintenance and may be easier integrated in existing applications. Since July 2013, a diesel particulate filter and exhaust gas recirculation has been available for the M-series in order to comply with the stricter exhaust gas regulations in the US (EPA Tier IV final) and the EU (Stage IIIB).  L-series  Hatz Diesel 4L43 engine with DPF. The L-series is mostly identical to the M-series in terms of its design except for the patented SILENT PACK ¬© of the L-series, which reduces the noise level by up to 90% compared to the non-capsulated M-series. The power of the engines, available as two-, three- or four-cylinder versions ranges from 15.0 to 54.2 kW at a speed of up to 3000 rpm. The L-series is also available with a separable diesel particulate filter in order to comply with the current exhaust gas regulation in the EU and the US. Thus, engines of the M- and L-series are the only remaining air-cooled engines with air-cooling in this power class which satisfy the exhaust gas regulation.  H-series  bauma 2013 Since beginning of 2014, a new engine series expands the Hatz product portfolio: the H-series. Starting with the water-cooled four-cylinder engine model 4H50TIC, Hatz relies on common rail technology, turbo charger and external exhaust gas recirculation. The turbocharged 2 litre engine achieves a maximum power of 55 kW and sets the benchmark in its power class with a weight of only 173 kg. The engine complies with the strict limit values of EU 97/68 Stage IIIB and EPA Tier 4 final without particulate filter.OEM Off-Highway OEM Off-Highway MagazineSAE - Hatz's next-generation industrial compact engine = Systems = The Hatz business field of Hatz Systems has developed and produced special systems on the basis of industrial diesel engines.

The institute was established in 2010 by advocate Shraga Biran as a community interested company. It aims to promote structural reforms in Israel.About - The Institute for Structural Reforms website right  Missions and aims  The Institute for Structural Reforms' primary mission is to conduct studies in economic-legal fields, which are related to social problems in Israel and especially to questions of poverty and inequality within the Israeli society. Another aim is to create position papers that will contribute to the Israeli public discussion on these issues by influencing on policy makers in the areas of housing poverty, privatization and inequality.  Research and projects  = Housing and urban renewal policy = The research project studies models of national housing and urban renewal policies in Western countries and their potential to be implemented in Israel. The research aims to contribute to the public discourse on the housing problem in Israel, which derives from a rapid shortage of new apartments from the middle class and the lower middle class in the last 20 years. The study offers an alternative to previous government programs and legislations for urban renewal by removing the bureaucratic obstacles and enabling an economic feasibility for the urban renewal of poor and neglected neighborhoods. According to the model of the Institute for Structural Reforms, giving the tenants grand building rights will help them to accumulate capital and will create affordable housing for a population that will empower the neighborhood. The presumption is that urban renewal combined with a heterogeneous population will improve the housing problem in Israel. = The new geopolitics in the Middle East = The study aims to examine the impact of the geo-political changes, the dependency of the Great powers and the activity of the U.S. and China in the energy market in the Middle East on the chance to reach a regional stability. The project offers possible trends and scenarios that might result from the geo-political changes in order to contribute to the public contemporary discourse on Israel-China relationships.The New Geo- Politics in the Middle East - United States and China's Common Interests in Regional Peace = Social privatization = Until the end of the 1970s, economists and political scientists considered Israel's the economic and social policies to be social democratic. In the 1980s, this opinion shifted as Israel's economic and social policy gradually moved towards neo-liberalism. The research on Social Privatization aims to develop the concept of 'Social Privatization' and its implementation in the State of Israel as an alternative to privatizations' policy of the last decades in the country. The study defines Social Privatization as the distribution of state property to the general public in a way that will reduce poverty and social inequality. = Structural reform in planning = Global trends in the field of national planning are characterized for having two levels: the national level and the regional level. The national level secures the strategic interests of the state alongside the local planning, which addresses immediate needs and challenges on the regional level in cities and neighborhoods.Structural Reforms in Planning In Israel, the national planning is centralistic and has not changed since the 1920s. The development of a structural reform in planning ought to replace the centralistic planning in Israel.

Online available at http://ejournal.communicatio- socialis.de/index.php/cc/article/view/64, S. 281 The media ethical orientation of the periodical stands in keeping with a world-view characterized by the Christian faith. Media ethics is understood as a Christianly motivated contemporaneous service to society. The subject area ‚ÄúReligion, Church and Communication‚Äù, respectively Roman Catholic-related journalism, is the second thematic priority of the journal upon which, until 2013, the primary focus lay.  History  In 1968 Franz-Josef Eilers, in connection with Michael Schmolke and Karl R. H√∂ller founded the professional journal for communication in religion, Church and society ‚ÄúCommunicatio Socialis‚Äù. The title of the publication is derived from the title of the conciliar decree Decretum de instrumentis Communicationis socialis ‚ÄûInter mirifica‚Äú. This was the first decree of the Catholic Church concerning means of communication.Cf. Schmolke, Michael: Franz-Josef Eilers wurde 75. Eine Collage als Hommage f√ºr den Gr√ºnder von ‚ÄûCommunicatio Socialis‚Äú. In: Communicatio Socialis. Internationale Zeitschrift f√ºr Kommunikation in Religion, Kirche und Gesellschaft. 40/2007, issue #3. From its theological orientation, the journal stands for the spirit of this Council and feels committed to its declarations and ecumenical perspective.Eilers, Franz-Josef: Publizistik als Aufgabe. In: Communicatio Socialis 1/1968, issue #1, p. 1‚Äì5, especially p. 3. The founder, Franz-Josef Eilers SVD, saw a special task for the journal in the collection and summarization of news concerning events in the sphere of church-related journalism throughout the world. Communicatio Socialis should serve all those, who feel committed towards the journalistic tasks and responsibilities as a source of information and to stimulate discussion. Recently, Communicatio Socialis has developed in the direction of a general communications and media science publication with a media-ethical and ecclesiastic-religious focus. From 1968 until 1993 the journal bore the subtitle ‚ÄúPublication for Journalism in the Church and World‚Äù. In the issue 26/1993 this changed to ‚ÄúInternational Publication for Communication in Religion, Church and Society‚Äù. With the double-issue 3/4 (2013) the journal underwent a media-ethical realignment and now bears the subtitle ‚ÄúPublication for Media Ethics and Communication in the Church and Society‚Äù.

The process is known as MVH because the microwaves penetrate uniformly throughout the volume of the product being heated, thus delivering energy evenly into the body of the material. This is in contrast to traditional thermal processing, which relies on conduction and convection from hot surfaces to deliver energy into the product. Liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids heated by MVH do not come into contact with hot surfaces; this minimizes thermal damage to functional components, and allows thick and viscous products to be heated without fouling.Queen Margaret University. 2012. http://www.qmu.ac.uk/marketing/press_releases/microwave_technology.htm. experts revolutionise global food processing. Processing temperatures can be very accurately controlled by varying the flow rate of the product through the MVH treatment chamber. The slower the flow, the higher the final product temperature.

The main mechanism of microbial inactivation by microwaves is due to thermal effect; the phenomenon of lethality due to 'non-thermal effect' is controversial, and the mechanisms suggested include selective heating of micro-organisms, electroporation, cell membrane rupture, and cell lysis due to electromagnetic energy coupling. Because microwaves transfer electromagnetic energy at a molecular level, and the vibration of the molecules creates heat through friction, it is difficult to properly check for this highly localized 'micro'-thermal effect or create conditions where study of the putative 'athermal' effect is possible.

He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Detroit Tigers in 2014. Amateur career Collins graduated from Northwest High School in Justin, Texas. He began his college baseball career at Baylor University, playing for the Baylor Bears baseball team. After his freshman year, he transferred to Howard College, where he played for the Howard Hawks. He was named the 2011 National Junior College Athletic Association Division I Baseball Player of the Year award, after he led the NJCAA Division I with 19 home runs and finished second with a .488 batting average and 82 runs batted in (RBIs). Collins with the Lakeland Flying Tigers in 2012 Following the 2011 season, Collins committed to transfer to Texas Christian University (TCU) to play for the TCU Horned Frogs. Professional career = Detroit Tigers = Collins was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the sixth round of the 2011 MLB draft. Collins signed with the Tigers, rather than transfer to TCU. Following the regular season, he played for the Sydney Blue Sox of the Australian Baseball League, and was named to the 2011 Australian Baseball League All-Star Game where he earned the game MVP award. After the 2013 season, the Tigers assigned him to the Arizona Fall League. =2014 season= On March 29, 2014, the Detroit Tigers purchased Collins' contract from Double-A Erie, and added him to the 25-man roster. The Tigers intended for Collins to serve as a backup and platoon partner with Rajai Davis. He made his Major League debut March 31, 2014, as a pinch runner for Alex Avila in the bottom of the ninth and scored the winning run to end the game. After batting 2-for-14 in sporadic playing time, the Tigers optioned Collins to the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League on April 18. On September 1, 2014, Collins was called up by the Tigers. Following being called up, Collins entered the game as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning of a game against the Cleveland Indians, where he hit his first career home run. =2015 season= Collins saw more extensive major league playing time in 2015 after the Tigers traded away outfielder Yoenis C√©spedes in late July. In 60 games, Collins hit .266 with four home runs and 25 RBIs. =2016 season= On April 25, 2016, during a home game against the Oakland Athletics, Collins gave the Detroit crowd the finger after he lost a flyball in the lights and the home crowd began booing him. This play allowed Marcus Semien to advance to third base and put Jordan Zimmermann's scoreless streak on the line. Collins apologized after the game, saying that he was \\"embarrassed in himself\\" by his behavior. He was not suspended, but was optioned to the Toledo Mud Hens on April 27. Collins returned to Detroit on July 15 after Justin Upton was placed on the bereavement list. He remained with the Tigers following the return of Upton, as the team chose to option Steven Moya to AAA instead. He would finish 2016 with a .235 batting average and 4 home runs in 56 games. =2017 season= On April 6, 2017, Collins hit his first home run of the season, a solo blast in the second inning against the Chicago White Sox.

According to the president of Ecuador Rafael Correa, the law's purpose is to democratize the media ‚Äústrengthen freedom of expression and promote 'a good press'‚Äù in the country. The communication law consists of 109 articles. These articles are organized under five different categories. Titles/Categories Title I has all the articles that deal with the general dispositions or guidelines that communication mediums must follow. Title II deals with the normative rules for audiovisual communication. Title III includes the basic norms for regulating the audio visual communication market. Title IV is concerned with services from public audiovisual lenders. Title V addresses the state council of audiovisual communication. Title VI is the basic sanctioning regiment. Background In September 2010, a crisis arising from pay disputes with the police resulted in president Rafael Correa being held captive at a police hospital. Correa was freed following clashes occurred between rebellious police forces and loyal army and police forces at the hospital. The following February, Emilio Palacio, a journalist for El Universo, wrote a column about the events that called Correa a dictator and said the president should be criminally charged for ordering soldiers to fire on a hospital full of civilians. As a result, Correa sued Palacio along with the owners of the newspaper El Universo for libel. Correa sued the independent newspaper for defamation and demanded 80 million dollars in reparation, with a three-year jail sentence to be issued to Palacio and owners. Correa ended withdrawing his lawsuit against these individuals; however, he did want to change the law for the future. Law Passed In order to avoid a repetition of the El Universo case, Correa passed a communication law on June 14, 2013. Article 26 of the law limits periodical information gathering if the intent is to defame someone of political standing, or a citizen. Communicators' rights are also altered; sources used for claims do not guarantee the safety of journalists if they conflict with the law. Private communication channels and radio now have to dedicate approximately a third of their airing time towards public transmission. The other two thirds of transmission is for the private and public sector communities. Criticism The communication law has received much criticism, with claims that the law is inefficient and limiting in regards to freedom of speech. The Colombian Association of Newspapers and Informative Media (Andiarios) called the document \\"the final stab‚Äù against freedom of expression in the country. Frank La Rue, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, said that the law needs to be re- analyzed further and sent back to the Republic's Congress so it can be discussed more broadly before its approval.

(2009) 2D Verses 3D Tactical Supremacy in Urban Operations. Journal of Information Warfare. (8)2: 13-24.  Developing the tactical concept  In developing the tactical concept of Rhizome Manoeuvre, the Rhizome observed in nature, such as the complex movement of plant root structures, where these work their way through soil, has been seen as analogous to the movement of a combat unit though complex urban built-up environments; and used as a way to explain the key tactical ideas of a Rhizome Manoeuvre.Flaherty, C. (2010) Command, Influence and Information in 3D Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. (9)1: 18-31.  Historical origin  Infiltration tactics, used in World War I, by assault parties have been identified as an early development of Rhizome manoeuvre.Flaherty, C. (2010) Command, Influence and Information in 3D Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. (9)1: 18-31. As this involved small units of troops moving toward, and through opposing trenches, through infiltration of various weak points, in order to launch surprise attacks overwhelming the defenders. During the Battle of Ortona, the Canadian Army developed a tactic known as mouse-holing, which involved using anti-tank weapons to blast holes through walls of adjacent buildings, allowing the assaulting forces to advance through the hole into the adjacent space. In 1997, the US Army began to identify future warfare concepts, such as Rhizome manoeuvre, describing: \\"Future land combat units will exploit terrain by maneuvering for tactical advantage within the folds and undulations of the earth's surface without suffering the restrictions imposed on mobility by contact with the ground.\\"The Annual Report on The Army After Next (AAN) Project, July 1997 (August 1, 1997). = Use by the Israel Defense Forces = Various application of Rhizome Manoeuvre, have been developed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), during its operations; these have been the subject of critical analysis by Eyal Weizman, in particular his essay on Lethal Theory, which appeared as a chapter in his 2007 book Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation, as \\"Urban Warfare: Walking Through Walls\\" (pp 185‚Äì221).Eyal Weizman.

Poklonskaya was a Ukrainian prosecutor from 2002 to February 2014, working in various Prosecutor's Offices or as an assistant district attorney. During the 2014 Crimean crisis, she resigned from Ukrainian service and was appointed Prosecutor General of Crimea on 11 March 2014; a press conference given by Poklonskaya on that day resulted in her becoming an Internet phenomenon. After Crimea was annexed by Russia during the 2014 Crimean crisis, Poklonskaya's appointment was confirmed by Russian authorities on 25 March, around the same time Ukrainian judicial authorities declared her a wanted criminal. Poklonskaya resigned as Prosecutor General on 6 October 2016 due to her election to the State Duma during the 2016 Russian legislative election. Poklonska resigned, Ukrayinska Pravda (27 September 2016)  Early life  Poklonskaya was born 18 March 1980 in the village of Mikhailovka, Voroshilovgrad Oblast, Ukrainian SSR; later in 1990, her family moved to Yevpatoria in Crimea. She graduated from the University of Internal Affairs in Yevpatoria in 2002. Her parents are both retired, living in Crimea, and both her grandfathers died during the Second World War, with only her grandmother surviving the German occupation. On 1 May 2018, Poklonskaya stated in an interview to the news agency Sputnik that her grandmother is of Serbian ethnicity, from Serbian settlers who settled in territory of Imperial Russia between 1753‚Äì64, in the Slavo-Serbia military frontier of Imperial Russia, located in the territory of present-day Luhansk Oblast and Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine.  Career  = Ukrainian service = After her graduation, Poklonskaya worked in the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office, initially serving as an assistant prosecutor to the Acting Prosecutor of the Republic of Crimea. She was the assistant attorney of Krasnogvardeisky district in Crimea from 2002 to 2006, and the assistant attorney of Yevpatoria from 2006 to 2010. Between 2010 and 2011, she was the deputy chief of a surveillance law enforcement unit of the Prosecutor's Office of Crimea which was responsible for dealing with organized crime. In 2011 in Simferopol, she acted as the state prosecutor in the high-profile trial of Ruvim Aronov, a former deputy of the Supreme Council of Crimea and a former manager of the Saki soccer club. Aronov was prosecuted for his leadership role in the Bashmaki gang, an organized crime group that emerged in Crimea, Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, and Kyiv after the 1990 dissolution of the USSR. The gang had been \\"known for its cruelty\\" and had been implicated in racketeering, robberies, eight abductions, and 50 murders. In December of the same year, Poklonskaya was assaulted in the stairwell of her home in Yalta. As a result, she suffered partial facial paralysis. The attack is widely believed to have been a revenge of the Bashmaki gang. In the same year, she was appointed the inter-district environmental prosecutor of Simferopol. Following that, she was transferred to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office in Kyiv, where she served as a senior prosecutor. From October to December 2012, Poklonskaya worked as head of the prosecutors with the proceedings of the Court of Appeal of Crimea. Later, from December 2012 up until March 2014, she was a senior attorney of the 2nd division of the General Directorate of Internal Affairs involved in pre-trial investigation and public prosecution management supervision with oversight of law enforcement in criminal proceedings. On 25 February 2014, Poklonskaya handed in her resignation, in which she stated that she was \\"ashamed to live in the country where neo-fascists freely walk about the streets\\" (a reference to radical Euromaidan activists). The resignation was not accepted. Instead, she was given a vacation and left Kyiv for Crimea where her parents lived. In Simferopol, Poklonskaya offered her help to the Crimean government. = Prosecutor of Crimea = Poklonskaya in uniform as Prosecutor General, March 2015 On 11 March 2014, when Crimea was not controlled by Ukraine, Poklonskaya was appointed Prosecutor of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Poklonskaya was appointed to the position by Sergei Aksyonov after the position had been reportedly rejected by four others, including the former Vice-Prosecutor of Crimea, Vyacheslav Pavlov.4 March 2014, –ü—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–æ—Ä –ö—Ä—ã–º–∞ –ø–æ–¥–∞–ª –≤ –æ—Ç—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫—É. –í—ã–±—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ , –ö—Ä—ã–º—Å–∫–∏–π –í–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä.

For her part, Poklonskaya refers to the change of power in Ukraine as an \\"unconstitutional coup and armed seizure of power\\", and called Ukraine's new parliamentarians \\"devils from the ashes.\\" Immediately following her appointment as Prosecutor, she was involved in an investigation into the violent attacks committed against Crimean Berkut members. On 19 March 2014, Poklonskaya confirmed that investigations were ongoing into a shooting in Simferopol which killed two while denying reports that the shooter had been detained. She compared the shooting to the \\"sniper attacks on Independence Square in Kyiv\\" from 18 to 21 February, and stated her belief that the shooting was meant to \\"provoke violence between the military forces\\" of Ukraine and Crimea. Crimea, which in the meantime had come under Russian control and become a federal subject of Russia (since then Crimea is under dispute by Russia and Ukraine), saw the creation of its new Prosecutor's Office, now subordinated to Russia's Prosecutor General Yury Chaika. On 25 March, Chaika appointed Poklonskaya as acting Prosecutor of the Republic of Crimea for this new office. Around the same time, Poklonskaya was listed as a wanted criminal on the website of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, due to alleged involvement in conspiracy to overthrow constitutional order or seize state power. The Federation Council of Russia declared the charges against Poklonskaya a \\"bluff\\". On 27 March, Russian Prosecutor General Yury Chaika granted Poklonskaya the rank of Senior Counsellor of Justice. On 4 April, Poklonskaya gave the approval for the Russian FSB to begin an operation to arrest Yevgeniy Pomelov, the assistant attorney of Yalta, as part of a larger bribery case.4 April 2014, –ü–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–æ—Ä–∞ –Ø–ª—Ç—ã –∑–∞–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–∏ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤–∑—è—Ç–∫–∏, –õ–µ–Ω—Ç–∞.—Ä—É4 April 2014,–ü–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫ —è–ª—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–æ—Ä–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–ª —Ñ–∏–≥—É—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–∞ –æ –≤–∑—è—Ç–∫–µ, –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä—Ñ–∞–∫—Å On 11 April, the Prosecutor General of Russia personally presented Poklonskaya with her official papers as a Russian legal officer. On 2 May, Russian president Vladimir Putin appointed Poklonskaya Chief Prosecutor of Crimea. On 4 May, Poklonskaya accused the Crimean Tatars' self-governmental body (the Mejlis) of extremist activity, warning that the Mejlis could be dissolved and outlawed across Russia. On 12 May, the European Union added Poklonskaya to its sanctions list. This barred her from entering EU countries and any of her assets there, if existent, were to be frozen. Canada imposed similar sanctions on Poklonskaya a month later, followed by Japan on 4 August. Australia followed soon after, sanctioning the Russian prosecutor on 2 September. On 19 December, the United States introduced its individual sanctions against several Ukrainian separatists and Russians, of which Poklonskaya was the only woman. In June, Poklonskaya was appointed as a judge to \\"guarantee impartiality in the selection of winners\\" for Russia's Five Stars singing competition, which would select Russia's entrant for the Intervision Song Contest. In September, Poklonskaya declared that those who did not recognize the annexation of Crimea by Russia, as well as those who incited ethnic strife, would be deported. Also in November 2014, Poklonskaya was rated as the sixteenth out of the hundred most promising politicians in Russia by the Institute for Social-Economic and Political Studies. In March 2015, Poklonskaya was appointed as the head of the Japanese- Russian Friendship Society. On 11 June 2015, Russian president Vladimir Putin granted Poklonskaya the rank of 3rd Class State Counsellor of Justice which corresponds with the military rank of Major General. Poklonskaya resigned as Prosecutor General on 27 September 2016 due to her election as MP in the State Duma during the 2016 Russian legislative election. Prior to her resignation, she was the youngest female general in Russia, at age 36. = Political career = In 2015, Poklonskaya announced that she would be running as an MP in the State Duma for the United Russia party. Poklonskaya was elected during the 2016 Russian legislative election. Throughout Russia, she was sometimes considered a potential candidate at the early stages of the presidential elections in 2018. Duma member Poklonskaya (right) with Head of the Republic of Crimea Sergei Aksyonov In office, Poklonskaya became notable for her defense of early 20th century Tsar Nicholas II. Considered a Saint by the Russian Orthodox Church, Nicholas II was accused in the film Matilda of having an affair with Mathilde Kschessinska. Poklonskaya defended the Tsar and called on local prosecutors to determine whether the film was religiously insensitive. Poklonskaya was accused of being the head of an unofficial \\"Orthodox Taliban\\" by Deutsche Welle. Poklonskaya has argued that Nicholas II's abdication in 1917 was legally null and void. Poklonskaya called on U.S. President Donald Trump to visit Crimea so he could \\"personally testify\\" that his words at the 2018 G7 summit, saying that Crimea is a part of Russia, were correct. In 2018, Poklonskaya was the only United Russia MP to vote against a government bill to raise the retirement age.  Internet popularity  After a video of Poklonskaya at a press conference on 11 March 2014 was uploaded to YouTube, her attractiveness and youth went viral among mainly Japanese and Chinese internet users and also became the focus of attention of Internet communities such as Reddit, 4chan and Vkontakte, which was reported by international news outlets. Within a month, the press conference was viewed over 1.7 million times. Many fan-created anime-style moe images of her uploaded to the Internet also attracted international media attention. A music video by Enjoykin based on Poklonskaya's press conferences and interviews has had 43 million views on YouTube. In 2014, Poklonskaya was among the most searched-for celebrities on the Internet in both Russia and Ukraine. According to Google, she was the year's 7th most searched-for person in Russia and the 8th in Ukraine, and according to the Russian search engine Yandex ‚Äì the 2nd most searched-for female in Ukraine and the 4th in Russia. She was described as a sex symbol by the New York Observer and Die Welt.  Personal life  = Family = Due to the international media coverage she received in 2014, Poklonskaya has been intentionally reticent about her personal life. Although Russian media reported her as being married, when Poklonskaya failed to disclose her husband's name in her financial declarations, she was forced to admit that she had broken up with her fianc√©, and had only stated she was married to prevent unwanted attention from male fans who may have wanted to date her. Poklonskaya has a daughter named Anastasiya. On 13 August 2018, a number of media reported that Poklonskaya married 47-year-old Ivan Nikolaevich Soloviev, a veteran of law enforcement agencies, honoured lawyer of Russia, and head of the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia. The wedding took place in Crimea. A year later, in September 2019, Soloviev revealed that he and Poklonskaya had separated. =Other details= Poklonskaya stated in March 2014 that she intends to apply for Russian citizenship. She plays the piano. On her visit to the summer residence of Tsar Nicholas II, she played such classical music pieces as Masquerade, a waltz by Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian. She views her beauty as an asset: \\"My looks have never been an obstacle ‚Äì I hope they deceive my enemies.\\" Poklonskaya is deeply religious, and is a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church. In February 2017, she led a campaign to block the release of the film Matilda for its allegedly blasphemous portrayal of the affair between Tsar Nicholas II (who has been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church) and the ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. In March, she claimed that a bronze bust of the Tsar in Simferopol was seeping fragrant myrrh. Her claims were denied by the Russian Orthodox Church and prompted ridicule from Russian netizens. In April, she released a 39-page report denouncing the film and alleging, among other claims, that the well-documented affair could not have happened as Kshesinskaya was, in the opinion of the report's authors, too ugly to have attracted the attention of the Tsar.
