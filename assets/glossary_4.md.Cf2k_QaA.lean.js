She graduated from Mount Vernon High School in 1971. After a year at the Manhattan School of Music, she participated in flute master classes with Jean-Pierre Rampal at the International Summer School, Nice, France. She earned a Bachelor of Music Degree in 1975 from the Manhattan School of Music where she majored in flute performance. She continued to work as a professional musician until 1980. In the summers of 1975 and 1976, she took printmaking courses at the Lake Placid School of ArtLake Placid Center for the Arts: Lake Placid Center for the Arts , accessed January 19, 2012 and then studied from 1976 to 1982 at the Pratt Graphics Center in New York City where she made lithographs and was introduced to mezzotint engraving. She had her first solo museum exhibition at the Wichita Art Museum in 1986‚Äì1987. Research Beginning in the mid-1980s, Wax responded to the limitations of current technical knowledge of mezzotint engraving and printing by conducting her own research into historical techniques while continuing to work as a printmaker. Though mezzotint was developed mainly as a method for copying oil paintings, her research uncovered techniques long out of use that had promising applications for use in contemporary art. She held a residency at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, in 1986 and received an Artist's Fellowship Grant from the New York Foundation for the Arts in 1987.New York Foundation for the Arts: \\"Carol Wax\\" , accessed January 18, 2012 Wax conducted technical experiments based on her historical research and for a few years she devoted more of her time to research and writing than her own artistic production. In 1990, Harry N. Abrams (in the U.S.) and Thames & Hudson (in the U.K.) published the results of her research as The Mezzotint: History and Technique, reissued by Abrams in a soft-cover edition in 1996.Carol Wax, The Mezzotint: History and Technique (US: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.; UK: Thames and Hudson, Ltd., 1990 Wax photographed all of the technical illustrations for that volume, as well as much of the flatwork, and produced the line drawings. In its two sections, Wax reviewed the history of mezzotint techniques and then detailed their use as a guide for contemporary artists in the craft. A lengthy review in Winterthur Portfolio noted it was the \\"first comprehensive study of mezzotint...and the most significant discussion of the subject\\" since a more narrowly focused 1884 study. It said that Wax brought \\"a technician's attention to detail, an artist's sensitivity to the nuances of process, and a historian's interest in cause and effect\\" to her work. It praised her exploitation of little-known German publications dating from 1771 and 1889 to expand on familiar historical accounts and her investigation of the impact of such technological developments as steel plates on the artist's technique, types of paper and ink, and the characteristics of the resulting images.E. McSherry Fowble, review of Carol Wax, The Mezzotint:History and Technique in Winterthur Portfolio, vol. 26, no. 2/3 (Summer - Autumn, 1991), 184-6 Writing in Print Quarterly, Ellen D'Oench said that: \\"the appearance of Carol Wax's book is an important event...not before now have we had access to an exhaustive treatment of mezzotint's history and process, enriched by copious and superb reproductions....Wax, a mezzotint artist herself, handles with skill a vast amount of information....She excels in her observations about individual prints...and in her selection of reproductions....Wax has a keen eye for the particulars and a broad knowledge of the subject....This is a triumph of word and image in the service of explication.\\"Ellen D'Oench, Print Quarterly, June, 1991, pp. ?? Printmaking, exhibiting, and teaching Wax found that her increased technical confidence expanded the scale and complexity of her imagery. Influenced in part by the work of Philip Pearlstein, she produced more refined and intricate treatments of light and shadow, more sophisticated explorations of the ways that light and shadow create the illusions of volume and depth, and more complex layering of pictorial elements. In the years that followed, she received over thirty-five prizes in national and international exhibitions. In 1994 she received the Louise Nevelson Award for Excellence in Printmaking from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Wax has executed several commissions for mezzotint editions from Cradle Oak Press at Bradley University, in Peoria, Illinois (1994), Stone and Press Gallery (1994), the Albany Print Club (2002), the Matrix Program at the University of Dallas in Irving, Texas (2003), Indiana University Southeast in New Albany, Indiana (2005), and the Print Club of Rochester, New York (2008). The Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation's Space Program provided Wax with studio space in 1996-1997.Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation: Space Program , accessed January 19, 2012 That allowed Wax to work with pastels and oil paints for the first time, which in turn affected her engravings even as she determined to work in several mediums. Impatient with the time-consuming requirements of mezzotint's grounding process, Wax developed ways to prepare mezzotint grounds more efficiently and in 1996 designed a system for attaching adjustable weights to the rocker, the mezzotint engraver's most important tool. This invention, the first improvement to rocker design in over three hundred years, is now manufactured by the toolmakers Edward C. Lyons.The modified rockers and weights are now manufactured by the toolmaker Edward C. Lyons, Bronx, New York.

She has also taught intaglio and woodcut courses for several years at the State University of New York at New Paltz and, in winter 2002 term, a course on Print Connoisseurship in New York University's School of Continuing Education. In 2002, Wax moved to Peekskill, New York, to take advantage of the city's downtown revitalization program that gave artists the chance to purchase live/work spaces, known as \\"The Art Lofts,\\" with minimal down payments.Peekskill Art Lofts: Peekskill Art Lofts, accessed January 19, 2012 An Artist's Fellowship Grant in 2003 from the New York Foundation for the Arts and a Concordia Career Advancement Award the following year enabled Wax to acquire and refurbish a secondhand etching press that was large enough and powerful enough to accommodate her bigger plates. This equipment allowed Wax to free herself of dependence on contract printers and to create large-scale color mezzotint engravings using multiple plates and incorporating a host of related techniques such as stipple, drypoint, and burin engraving.

Raffles Davison, was an English architect, architectural illustrator and journalist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work featured in The British Architect and Northern Engineer for over 40 years from 1874, and he became editor of the publication in 1878 until it merged with The Builder in 1919.Architectural Journals, British Association for Local History -  Early life  He was born in Stockton-on-Tees in 1853, the second son of a Congregational minister. Educated privately at Shrewsbury, he showed a rare talent for drawing from an early age and it was partly for this reason that he was articled to the architect W H Spaull in Oswestry. On completion of his articles he worked for a time as architectural assistant in offices in Nottingham and in the office of H J Paull of Manchester. Career Although he subsequently carried out some minor architectural commissions on his own account, it was his drawing skills that would lead him to become the leading architectural illustrator of his generation.  The British Architect  His arrival in Manchester coincided with a move by several local architects to set up an architectural magazine to rival the London-based Builder. Davison became a major contributor to The British Architect and Northern Engineer and was appointed editor in 1878. In 1896, by which date the magazine had relocated to London, Davison became an Honorary Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects; he was later active in the work of the London Society.http://www.londonsocietyjournal.org.uk/  Architectural illustration  Sketch of the south end of Bramall Hall Some of his sketches - published in the magazine as Rambling Sketches (also the title of a book published in 1883) - were exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibitions, and at the Modern Gallery in 1907, in New York City after 1919 and in the RIBA Galleries in 1924. His presentation of architects' designs made him popular with many of the country‚Äôs leading architects, some of whom supported a book Record of Life and Work from 1870 to 1926 marking his retirement in 1927, with an introduction by Sir Reginald Blomfield RA. Then Sir Aston Webb wrote: :\\"To architects he has been known for nearly half a century for his peculiar power in transferring their elevations and sections into perspective form, not only understandable by the layman but truthfully portraying the design of the architect.\\"  Death  Raffles Davidson died on 5 May 1937, aged 84. at his home, ‚ÄúWhistler‚Äôs Hollow,‚Äù Woldingham, Surrey. This house had been designed by W Rupert Davison, although has also been credited to T. Raffles Davison himself. Davison had himself commented, \\"It would be idle to deny that to an architect the allurement of the art of drawing is sometimes divergent from his architecture.

John Topham went to London while still young with a minor appointment under Philip Carteret Webb, solicitor to the Treasury. By influence he obtained a place in the State Paper office with Sir Joseph Ayloffe and Thomas Astle. On 5 February 1771 Topham was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, and on 5 April 1779 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In May 1781 he was appointed a deputy-keeper of the state papers, and in April 1783 a commissioner in bankruptcy. On 19 March 1787 he became a bencher of Gray's Inn, and on 29 Nov. was elected treasurer of the Society of Antiquaries of London, to which he had been admitted a Fellow in 1767. About 1790 he became librarian to the Archbishop of Canterbury, in succession to Michael Lort. He also filled the offices of registrar to the charity for the relief of poor widows and children of clergymen (now known as the Corporation of the Sons and Friends of the Clergy) and of treasurer to the orphan charity school.

After graduating high school, Olt was not selected in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. Olt enrolled at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, where he played college baseball for the Connecticut Huskies. He was named a freshman All-American. Olt played for the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Danbury Westerners in 2008. In 2008 and 2009, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Professional career =Texas Rangers= Olt batting during spring training in 2012 The Rangers drafted Olt in the supplemental first round, with the 49th overall selection, of the 2010 MLB Draft. After he signed, Olt played for the Spokane Indians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League.

These simulations have known inputs and they result in a unique set of outputs. Contrast stochastic (probability) simulation, which includes random variables. Deterministic simulation models are usually designed to capture some underlying mechanism or natural process. They are different from statistical models (for example linear regression) whose aim is to empirically estimate the relationships between variables. The deterministic model is viewed as a useful approximation of reality that is easier to build and interpret than a stochastic model. However, such models can be extremely complicated with large numbers of inputs and outputs, and therefore are often noninvertible; a fixed single set of outputs can be generated by multiple sets of inputs. Thus taking reliable account of parameter and model uncertainty is crucial, perhaps even more so than for standard statistical models, yet this is an area that has received little attention from statisticians. Use of simulations Deterministic simulations in scientific research are used in various studies about population fields, climate development, and pollution, engineering, chemistry and policy-making. Deterministic simulations have received attention in statistical literature under the general topic of computer experiments. Computer experiments simulate complex system which requires a number of inputs.

A stochastic battlefield model, as provided in computer simulation applications like JANUS and ModSAF, produces results that can be made strictly reproducible if the same random number seed can be employed. However, such a model will not provide full human control over scenario composition and event sequencing. A deterministic battlefield model offers clear advantages for the test bed studies.

The Toronto Blue Jays drafted Marisnick in the third round of the 2009 MLB draft. He debuted in the major leagues with the Miami Marlins in 2013, but has played the majority of his career for the Houston Astros (2014-2019). Early career Marisnick attended Riverside Polytechnic High School in Riverside, California. He excelled for the school's baseball team, and was initially expected to be a first-round choice in the upcoming Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. However, he struggled during showcase events, and had a .406 batting average as a senior, lower than his batting average in his sophomore and junior years. He committed to attend the University of Oregon on a college baseball scholarship. Marisnick batting for the Jacksonville Suns (2013) The Toronto Blue Jays drafted Marisnick in the third round of the 2009 MLB draft. Rather than attend Oregon, Marisnick signed with the Blue Jays, receiving a $1 million signing bonus, more than double the suggested bonus for a player drafted at that position. Before the 2012 season, MLB.com rated Marisnick as the 58th-best prospect in baseball. On November 19, 2012, Marisnick was traded to the Miami Marlins along with Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson √Ålvarez, Yunel Escobar, Jeff Mathis, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino, in exchange for Mark Buehrle, Josh Johnson, Jos√© Reyes, John Buck, and Emilio Bonifacio. On January 29, 2013, Marisnick was named number 70 on MLB's Top 100 Prospects list. Major league career =Miami Marlins= On July 23, 2013, the Marlins promoted Marisnick and Christian Yelich to the major leagues from the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. Marisnick recorded his first major league hit on July 26, 2013, off Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Jeff Locke. Marisnick hit his first career home run in a game against the New York Mets on July 31, 2013. The Marlins optioned Marisnick to the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League on March 27, 2014. He was recalled on June 16 when Christian Yelich was added to the disabled list. =Houston Astros= On July 31, 2014, the Marlins traded Marisnick, Colin Moran, Francis Martes, and a compensatory draft pick to the Houston Astros for Jarred Cosart, Enrique Hern√°ndez, and Austin Wates. Marisnick played in 51 games for the Astros in 2014, compiling a batting average of .272 with 3 home runs, 19 RBI, and 6 stolen bases. He also displayed strong defense while playing the outfield, with a fielding percentage of .984 and a range factor of 2.57. He made his first opening day MLB start for the Astros on April 6, 2015. He finished the 2015 season with an average of .236 and OPS of .665 over 133 games and 339 at bats. After a slow start to the 2016 season he was optioned to the Triple-A affiliate of the Astros, the Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League, on April 25, 2016. Marisnick was recalled by the Houston Astros on May 5, 2016. After former Astros center fielder Carlos G√≥mez was designated for assignment, Marisnick and Tony Kemp began sharing center field duties in his place. In 106 games of 2017, Marisnick finished with a .243 batting average, 16 home runs, and 35 RBIs. With the Astros finishing the year 101‚Äì61, the team clinched the AL West pennant, and eventually won the 2017 World Series, their first ever. Marisnick did not participate in any postseason action due to injury, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time, and won his first championship title. On July 7, 2018, he was sent down to AAA for the second time in the season, after struggling at the plate. In 2018 with Houston he batted .211/.275/.399. On July 7, 2019, while trying to score on a fly out, Marisnick collided with catcher Jonathan Lucroy of the Los Angeles Angels at home plate and was called out for violating Official Baseball Rule 6.01(i). Lucroy had a concussion and a broken nose as a result of the collision, and Marisnick was suspended for two games for the violation (pending appeal), although the collision was deemed unintentional. On July 18, 2019, at an away game against the Angels, Marisnick was hit by a pitch by Angels reliever No√© Ramirez in the high back, though the pitch was going for his head. Marisnick did not charge the mound or retaliate but went to 1st base. At first base first baseman Albert Pujols had an argument with the angered Astros dugout. Ramirez and Angels manager Brad Ausmus were suspended, Ramirez for three games and Ausmus for one. On July 29 it was announced that Marisnick had lost his appeal for his two-game suspension. In 2019 he batted .233/.289/.411 with 10 home runs and 34 RBIs in 292 at bats. =New York Mets= On December 5, 2019, Marisnick was traded to the New York Mets in exchange for left-handed pitcher Blake Taylor and outfielder Kenedy Corona.

As might be expected it is cold-resistant and able to tolerate occasional light frost, slowly growing to a tall branched tree - about 17 m at maturity - and perched on stilt-like aerial roots. The crown is made up of 5 m long, pale-green leaves, with finely toothed margins, while its fruits are sweet-tasting and edible. The leathery flower spathes are golden-yellow, the lowermost are largest and about 1m in length. These give rise to cone-like fruits, 15‚Äì25 cm long, that are bright orange to red when mature and consist of 5-6 angled drupes. This species was first described by William Roxburgh in 1814 in Hortus Bengalensis, from a specimen growing in the East India Company's Botanical Garden at Calcutta. Some two centuries later it has become a popular plant in cold climate gardens, though it is also cultivated throughout the tropics and subtropics. The tree from which the colour plate was made by Matilda Smith, was acquired in 1888 by Kew from a Ghent nurseryman, who believed it to have originated from Madagascar. Besides the Himalayan region, the species also occurs naturally in China in Guangxi, Xizang and Yunnan, also in Myanmar and in Java, Sumatra and Malaysia. Pandanus leaves are used for weaving pandan mats, ropes, house-building materials, hats and carrying bags. Extracts from the leaves, stems and roots are used in India to treat dysentery. The fragrant leaves of P. amaryllifolius, P. tectorius and P. odorifer are all used in Southeast Asian cooking to flavour rice and curry dishes, drinks and desserts. The male flowers of some species release an attractive and subtle perfume, the distilled essence of which is called kewra, and is used in cosmetics and cooking. Folklore believes the flowers may lure snakes.

The Latin title is a quotation from the Vulgate text of the first chapter of the Gospel of Saint Luke, describing the Annunciation,Luke 1:38: \\"\\". where Mary accepts the message brought to her by the Angel Gabriel that she would give birth to a child (Jesus) by God. History Rossetti deliberately used a limited colour range for this oil painting. The predominance of white, symbolic of virginity, is complemented by vibrant blue (a colour associated with Mary, though notably not used in his The Girlhood of Mary Virgin in 1849 and shown below) and red, for Christ's blood. Lilies are traditionally the symbol of Mary in Italian Renaissance art, but they are also considered funereal flowers, indicative of Christ's death.V. Surtees. Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Vol.I, Oxford: Clarendon Press (1971). Christina Rossetti posed for Mary but, as with her previous year's modelling, her brother altered her hair colour: in this instance making it auburn to continue the red palette. William Rossetti posed for Gabriel. This painting received mixed reviews. The most obvious break with tradition was Rossetti's choice of placing Mary in bed - her long nightgown suggestive of a newly-wed bride - woken by the angel, who is normally depicted appearing as Mary prays. Also controversial were Gabriel's lack of wings (the flames at his feet suggest a Classical influence) and his obvious nakedness, glimpsed through the side of his robe. Note also the dove's halo, and the differences between Mary's and Gabriel's haloes, which may have arisen because Mary's was painted in 1850, whereas Gabriel's was not added until 1853.J.

Francis McCracken, a well known Pre-Raphaelite patron, bought it in 1853 for ¬£50 and the Tate Gallery purchased it in 1886. In February 2013 it was not on display.

CSLDF also provides litigation support and files amicus briefs in related cases; promotes awareness among scientists of their legal rights and responsibilities, and makes public the legal actions taken against scientists. CSLDF claims that many legal challenges faced by scientists are intended to silence them for political reasons or stifle their research. According to CSLDF, litigation has intensified against climate scientists in recent years, and salaries earned by academics and researchers are often inadequate to pay for litigation defending against \\"corporate-funded law firms and institutes.\\" Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, CSLDF reported an increase in the need for their services from scientists concerned that they could be targeted by the Trump administration.  History  CSLDF was co-founded by Joshua Wolfe and Scott Mandia, a physical sciences professor at Suffolk County Community College, to help defray the legal costs of a lawsuit against the University of Virginia and Dr. Michael Mann. The organization hired its first executive director, attorney Lauren Kurtz, in 2014 and received 501(c)3 status in 2015.  Work  = Litigation = In 2011, CSLDF provided support and funding to Michael Mann when the American Tradition Institute (ATI) served a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on the University of Virginia regarding Mann's climate research. UVA and Mann engaged in litigation with ATI to prove that Virginia law protected Mann's emails and other documents. CSLDF raised more than $100,000 for Mann's litigation. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled in Dr. Mann's favor in spring 2014. = Amicus briefs = In addition to direct involvement in select litigations, CSLDF provides litigation support and files amicus briefs in related cases. In October 2015, CSLDF filed an amicus brief urging the Arizona Court of Appeals to protect climate scientists' files from open records requests made by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E; Legal). In March 2016, CSLDF filed an amicus brief before the Pima County Superior Court in Arizona, also arguing for protection of climate scientists' private files against open records requests by E&E; Legal. In February 2017, CSLDF filed an amicus brief in a FOIA litigation, urging the District of Columbia court to protect roughly 8,000 emails written and received by federal climate scientists. In July 2017, CSLDF filed an amicus brief asking the Arizona Court of Appeals to protect scientists from intrusive open record requests. = Legal education = CSLDF educates scientists about their legal rights and responsibilities and increases awareness of how FOIA and state open record law equivalents are used to harass and intimidate climate scientists. In early 2017, CSLDF began building a national legal network to help scientists at public and private universities in the United States.  Publications  In November 2016, after the U.S. presidential election, CSLDF published Handling Political Harassment and Legal Intimidation: A Pocket Guide for Scientists, which contains basic legal advice for scientists. In 2017, CSLDF partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on a pamphlet, \\"March for Science: Know Your Rights,\\" for those participating in the April 22, 2017 March for Science.

Dawes Hicks (from a group photograph taken in Cambridge in 1915) George Dawes Hicks FBA (14 September 1862 ‚Äì 16 February 1941) was a British philosopher who was the first Professor of Moral Philosophy at University College, London from 1904 until 1928 and professor emeritus thereafter until his death.  Biography  Hicks, eldest son of solicitor Christopher Hicks, was born in Shrewsbury on 14 September 1862 and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford He initially went on to study law within his father's legal practice. Hicks won a scholarship and went, in 1884, to Owens College Manchester to study philosophy (and gain some knowledge of the natural sciences). He did so under Robert Adamson \\"whose philosophical scholarship and acuteness exercised the most radical and lasting effect upon his. pupil's life and teaching\\". Hicks graduated in 1888 with first class honours. Hicks then went to Manchester College, Oxford and followed the lectures of Wallace, Nettleship. and Cook Wilson. Elected a Hibbert Scholar 1891‚Äì96, Hicks did further research at the University of Leipzig under Wundt, Heinze, and Volelt and assisted Meumann in his experimental investigations on apprehension of time. Hicks also advanced his earlier studies in physiology but concentrated his greater efforts on a detailed textual study of Kant (and mastering the relevant literature). He gained his PhD at Leipzig in 1896 with a thesis on Kant which was to be published the following year. On his return from Germany in 1897 Hicks became minister of Unity Church in Islington until 1903, and lectured for the London School of Ethics and Sociology. In 1904 he was made Litt.D. by Manchester University and was appointed to the Chair of Moral Philosophy. at University College, London (UCL). Hicks was the first person to fill the position which had lain vacant since UCL first advertised for two Chairs in philosophy in 1827. Carveth Read then the Grote Professor of Mind and Logic, as Jonathan Wolff reports, persuaded the College to make such an appointment and thus fulfill \\"for the first time the original conception of the Department\\". (Wollf notes that Hicks is sometimes referred to as a Grote Professor, but that he was never given the title and, indeed may not have been entitled to hold it, due to his involvement in religious ministry.) During his time at UCL, Hicks continued to live, at least partly, in Cambridge where he regularly lectured at the university, under the auspices of the Faculty of Moral Science, on Psychology and on the Philosophy of Kant (and examined in the Moral Sciences Tripos on the former). He also \\"as a labour of love\\" gave annual lectures at Carmarthen College (a training college for teachers at religious schools) which were to be published in 1928 under the title \\"Ways towards the Spiritual Life\\". (Hicks was also for thirty years a trustee of Dr. Williams's Library.) S.V. Keeling (whose early studies at UCL were directed under Hick's advisement and who would later return there as an MA student and then as a lecturer during his tenure) describes Hicks as being, as a teacher \\"a man of single-mind, wholly engrossed in philosophy\\". Keeling reports that Hicks believed that philosophy \\"as no other subject, could impart to.. students an influence and a training such as would render them habitually reflective about their existence and destiny\\". Hicks \\"ever saw clearly that the spiritual value of philosophical studies far outweighed their academic importance\\" but denied \\"that philosophy could legitimately serve as a substitute for religion or for religious faith\\". Hick's significant efforts and influence as a teacher at UCL are testified to by Keeling, de Burgh and Stebbing alike and reported on by Wolf. Having already been secretary of the Aristotelian Society for many years, Hicks was made its president in 1913 and was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1927. He retired from UCL the following year and thereafter lived entirely in Cambridge but continued his long serving work as a sub-editor of the Hibbert Journal to his sick bed and, as Stebbing reports, \\"was writing his famous 'Philosophical Survey' for that Journal when death came, rather suddenly at the end\\" on 16 January 1941.

The label is the owned and run by DJ and producer Kasra Mowlavi and releases mostly Drum and bass records. Since it was started back in 2002, Critical Music has grown significantly and become a widely recognized name on the underground music scene. The label has released tracks by a number of artists including Enei, Rockwell, Spectrasoul, Calibre and Break and has a reputation for finding and developing new artists. Resident Advisor has described the label as \\"A wealth of innovation, growth and experimentation abounds at 170 beats per minute right now, and you can't get a much better‚Äîor more comprehensive‚Äîapproximation of it all than through the discography of London's Critical Recordings.\\" History Kasra Mowlavi started Critical Music in 2002. The label's first release was a single by Dphie - Five Faces / Evolve.2 and from there Critical began slowly but surely gathering fans looking for quality, fresh drum n bass releases. Critical's early years were more about a deeper, underground sound, but with the release of Spectrasoul - Alibi (Break remix) / Organiser in 2009, the label began to take a more dancefloor friendly turn and its profile became much more heightened. Despite this, Critical has never given in to the temptation to mass release cheap, high speed adrenaline rush tracks that other labels have in order to bring recognition and cash. Instead, it has gone for a more sophisticated version of the dancefloor smash with releases like Enei‚Äôs Cracker in 2011. In 2010 the label began running Critical Sound nights at venues around the UK and Europe. Critical now has a residency at Fabric London, and there are Critical Sound nights at clubs in other cities in the UK like Life in Brighton and Basement 45 in Bristol. The label has gained considerable profile for its releases, a number of which have won recognition within the industry. Mob Justice by Foreign Concept was included in KMag‚Äôs Best Singles of 2011 and the magazine said Critical ‚Äòcould do no wrong this year.‚Äô FACT Magazine listed the Rockwell Aria EP as one of the 50 Best Tracks of 2011. In 2011, the label signed the first of its exclusive artists, Russian DJ and producer Enei (Aleksei Egorchenkov). Enei won the Best Newcomer Producer award at the Drum n Bass Arena awards 2011, where Critical was also nominated for Best Label. The label has also been integral in the careers of Rockwell and Sabre. In April 2020, Critical Music were named 'Label of the Month' by Beatport.

He was known in the years 2010‚Äì2012 as David's Lyre, but is now using the musical project name Fyfe. He picked the name David's Lyre during his university studies in Manchester, in reference to the musical skills of the biblical King David with the lyre. He was featured by The Guardian as 'New band of the day' in 2010, by which time he had received attention for cover versions (of Ellie Goulding among others), remixes of other artists ‚Äì notably, Marina and the Diamonds and Everything Everything ‚Äì and had himself been remixed by producers The Last Skeptik and JaKwob. His debut EP release in 2011, In Arms, was described as \\"promising\\" by BBC reviewer Mike Diver, and drew comparisons with Patrick Wolf for its blend of folk and electronic instruments. A music video was released for \\"In Arms\\", using a short film animation which fitted the song. Dixon had signed a record contract with a major label in 2010, but the relationship ended in 2011, before releasing an album. Instead, his first full album Picture of Our Youth was self-released through Bandcamp in February 2012. Dixon announced in January 2012 that Picture of Our Youth would be his last album issued under the project name David's Lyre. Dixon now records and performs under the alias Fyfe. Having signed with Believe Recordings, Fyfe released his debut album Control on 9 March 2015.Fyfe announces debut record Control, shares video for ‚ÄúHolding On‚Äù, Line of Best Fit, 12 November 2014 The album includes the singles, \\"For You\\", \\"Holding On\\" and \\"Solace\\", and followed the self-released four-song EP titled Solace EP released in April 2013. As of 2016, Paul releases music through his own label Benvolio Music. The Space Between was released on 9 June 2017. It featured the single 'Belong', a collaboration with Kimbra. A collaborative project with Iskra Strings, Extended Play, was released 17 November 2018. He composed his first track for the BBC documentary Odd One Out which was released 12 September 2019.

She was the daughter of a coal merchant, and as a sickly child was advised to take dance classes for her health. She studied under Dorothea Halliwell, Olga Preobrajenska in Paris and Kathleen Crofton in London, and won awards for young dancers including the Anna Pavlova Cup and the Dancing Times Cup. Wright began working with Ballet Rambert in 1946. After further studies, she joined the London Festival Ballet, where she danced as prima ballerina and became best known for her work in ballets including Harlequinade and Giselle. She also danced for Roland Petit's Ballet de Paris, Le Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, and the Royal Ballet. Her farewell performance took place in 1977 in Tokyo, and afterward she worked as a dance teacher. Wright had two children. She was married to Swiss dancer Wolfgang Brunner but divorced in 1960.

He made his MLB debut in 2016. Drafted in the second round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft out of Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Bell received a $5 million signing bonus, a record for a player outside of the first round, to bypass his college baseball scholarship to the University of Texas at Austin. Amateur career Josh Bell attended Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas in Dallas, Texas. In his senior season at Jesuit, he had a .548 batting average and 1.054 slugging percentage with 13 home runs, 54 runs batted in and 54 runs scored. He was named to the USA Today All-USA high school baseball team and was also named the Gatorade/ESPN Rise Texas Player of the Year. Bell committed to attend the University of Texas at Austin on a scholarship that would allow him to play college baseball for the Texas Longhorns baseball team in the Big 12 Conference. Baseball America rated Bell as the nation's top corner outfielder available in the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. However, Bell sent a letter to the Commissioner of Baseball's office, indicating that teams should not select him, because he would follow through with his commitment to Texas, and would not sign a professional contract if drafted. The Pirates drafted Bell in the second round (61st overall) of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. Bell took twelve credits at the University of Texas and worked out with the team's strength and conditioning coach during the summer. Bell and the Pirates agreed to a contract with a $5 million signing bonus shortly before the August 2011 signing deadline. The signing bonus was a record for a player drafted in the second round. The Pirates gave out a record $17 million in signing bonuses to their 2011 draft class, surpassing the $11.93 million the Washington Nationals spent on their 2010 draft class. Professional career =Minor leagues= The Pirates assigned Bell to work out with the State College Spikes, but as the season was ending, he did not appear in a game with the Spikes in 2011. Bell participated in the Pirates' fall instructional league. Bell was ranked the 69th best prospect in baseball by MLB.com before the 2012 season. He made his professional debut in 2012 with the West Virginia Power of the Class A South Atlantic League. However, on April 24, 2012, Bell hit what would have been a double, but pulled up limping rounding first base, and was tagged out standing between first and second with an injury. Bell ended up having a partial tear of his meniscus, on the lateral part of the meniscus in his knee. Bell missed almost all of the 2012 minor league season, and was out longer than expected due to swelling in the injured knee. Bell again played for the West Virginia Power in 2013. He batted .279 with 13 home runs, 76 RBIs, and 37 doubles in 119 games. Bell opened the 2014 season with the Bradenton Marauders of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL), and appeared in the 2014 All-Star Futures Game. After hitting .335 with nine home runs and 35 RBIs for Bradenton in 84 games, the Pirates promoted Bell to the Altoona Curve of the Class AA Eastern League on July 17. In 24 games for Altoona, he batted .287/.343/.309. After the season, he was named the FSL Player of the Year. The Pirates assigned Bell to the Arizona Fall League after the 2014 season, where he played exclusively as a first baseman, due to the Pirates carrying Andrew McCutchen, Starling Marte, and Gregory Polanco in their major league outfield. The Pirates assigned Bell to Altoona to start the 2015 season. He was chosen to represent the Pirates at the 2015 All-Star Futures Game. At the end of July, the Pirates promoted Bell to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA International League. In 96 games for Altoona, he batted .307 with five home runs and 60 RBIs. He batted .347 with two home runs, 18 RBIs, and a .441 on- base percentage in 145 plate appearances with Indianapolis, and the Pirates added Bell to their 40-man roster after the season. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Bell began the 2016 season with Indianapolis. After batting .324 with a .407 on-base percentage in 83 games for the Indians, the Pirates promoted Bell to the major leagues on July 8. He made his MLB debut that night as a pinch hitter, and hit a grand slam in his second MLB at-bat on July 9. He was optioned back to Indianapolis on July 16, and recalled once again on August 20. In 128 at-bats for Pittsburgh, Bell batted .273 with three home runs and 19 RBIs. On February 1, 2017, Bell underwent left knee surgery, but did not go on the disabled list or miss any games. On September 4, 2017 Bell broke the National League record for most home runs by a rookie switch hitter, hitting his 24th of the season off of Jake Arrieta, in a 12‚Äì0 Pirates' rout of the Chicago Cubs He was one of three finalists for the 2017 Rookie of the Year award along with Cody Bellinger and Paul DeJong, and finished in third place in the balloting. Bell played 159 games, finishing with a .255 batting average, 26 home runs and 90 RBIs. On May 8, 2019, Bell became the fourth player in PNC Park history to hit a ball directly into the Allegheny River; the ball traveled 470+ feet with an exit velocity of 114+ MPH. Bell was elected to his first MLB All-Star Game on June 30, 2019. Bell also participated in the 2019 Home Run Derby where he was eliminated in the first round after hitting 18 home runs. On defense, in 2019 he had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league first basemen (.988).

It was formed at the start of World War I and served in overseas garrisons in Malta and Egypt. Although it never saw action as a formation, its constituent battalions fought at Gallipoli and served against the Senussi tribesmen. The brigade was then sent to the Western Front where it was broken up to provide drafts for 1st Line units. Origin When the Territorial Force (TF) was created in 1908, the 1st London Brigade in 1st London Division comprised the first four battalions of the new London Regiment, each of which had previously been a Volunteer battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (the City of London Regiment). When World War I broke out in 1914, the 1st London Brigade was the first complete TF formation to go overseas on service, relieving the Regular Army garrison of Malta in September. Each battalion left behind a cadre of officers and men (mainly those who were unfit or who had not volunteered for overseas service) to organise a 2nd Line battalion from the mass of volunteers who were coming forward. These units were distinguished from the 1st line by a '2/' prefix, so that the 2/1st London Brigade consisting of the 2/1st, 2/2nd etc battalions of the London Regiment was created in the 2/1st London Division. Initially, the 2nd Line was regarded as a reserve for the TF overseas, but its units were soon being prepared for overseas service themselves.Becke, p. 6.Becke, pp. 9‚Äì15.London Rgt at Long, Long Trail.London Rgt at Regimental Warpath.58th Div at Long, Long Trail.58th Div at Regimental Warpath.Grimwade, p. 14.Grey, p. 14. Order of battle The brigade was constituted as follows: * 2/1st (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) ‚Äì formed at Handel Street, Bloomsbury * 2/2nd (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) ‚Äì formed at Tufton Street, WestminsterGrey, p. ???. * 2/3rd (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) ‚Äì formed at Edward Street, Hampstead Road, St Pancras * 2/4th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) ‚Äì formed at Shaftesbury Street, City Road, HoxtonGrimwade, pp. 14‚Äì6.Anon, pp. 5‚Äì6. Basic training A serious shortage of equipment hampered the training of the 2nd Line TF units and formations ‚Äì at first 'wooden equivalents' had to be employed in place of rifles, later some .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles became available. 2/2nd Londons trained in Vincent Square, close to its Tufton St HQ, but this was too cramped and it soon moved to Tattenham Corner railway station to train on Epsom Downs. 2/3rd Londons also went to Epsom Downs, while 2/4th Bn moved from Hoxton to New Barnet. Despite the difficulties, the battalions were quickly recruited up to full strength, and in mid-December the whole of 2/1st London Brigade assembled around Maidstone.Grey, p. 15. Malta From Maidstone the brigade was ordered to Malta at short notice to relieve the 1/1st London Bde for service on the Western Front. The 2/2nd, 2/3rd and 2/4th battalions disembarked on 31 December, and their 1st Line equivalents departed on 2 January 1915, leaving behind for the newcomers their obsolete Long Lee-Enfield rifles and Vickers- Maxim machine guns and the unfit personnel.Overseas Garrisons at Regimental WarpathGrey, pp. 15‚Äì7, 55‚Äì6.Grimwade, pp. 14‚Äì7, 86. The 2/1st Londons only reached Malta on 11 February 1915. While on Malta the Brigade continued training, maintained coastal patrols, guarded Prisoners of war, caught possible spies, and performed public duties.Grey, pp. 55‚Äì60Grimwade, pp. 86‚Äì7. In April 1915, the 2/3rd Londons left Malta for Egypt, landing at Port Said and going to garrison Khartoum in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The battalions in Malta were still regarded as draft-finding units for the 1/1st Brigade, but in July they were ordered to prepare to go to Egypt as Service Battalions. The Brigade HQ and battalions arrived at Alexandria aboard various ships between 25 and 31 August.Grey, pp. 60‚Äì1.Grimwade, pp. 88‚Äì9.Martin, p. 29. Gallipoli Trench warfare at Cape Helles The brigade, including 2/3rd Londons returned from Khartoum, assembled at Abbassia Camp in Cairo and prepared to reinforce the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force fighting at Gallipoli. However, the brigade did not proceed as a complete formation, the battalions proceeding individually. The 2/1st and 2/3rd Battalions were the first to go, in September, being sent via Mudros to reinforce the Regulars of the 29th Division. The 2/3rd Londons landed at Suvla Bay on 23 September and were attached to 88th Bde in the 'Dublin Castle' Sector for training, with A Company attached to the 2nd Bn Royal Fusiliers.Becke, Pt 1, p. 119.Westlake, pp. 237‚Äì8. 2/1st Londons landed at W Beach, Suvla, about midnight on 24 September, and were attached to 88th Brigade. On arrival they were re-armed with modern Short Lee-Enfield rifles (other battalions of the brigade retained their obsolete Long Lee-Enfields) and then moved forward to the Brigade Reserve Area. The battalion was attached to the 1st Bn Essex Regiment for training.Westlake, pp. 233‚Äì4. After training in trench warfare the two battalions began tours of duty in the front line; the 2/1st Bn alternated with the Newfoundland Regiment on a weekly rotation at Essex Ravine. The rest of the brigade remained in Egypt until October, when they were sent to Gallipoli to reinforce the Royal Naval Division. 2/2nd Londons sailed on 5 October, then remained in Mudros harbour until 13 October when they transhipped to HMT Sarnia and landed at W Beach at Cape Helles.Westlake, pp. 235‚Äì7. They were followed by the 2/4th Battalion, which embarked on 9 October, transhipped at Mudros to the Sarnia and landed on 16 October.Westlake, pp. 238‚Äì40.Grimwade, p. 90.Martin, p. 30. 2/2nd Battalion was attached to the 2nd Royal Naval Brigade, and Officers and NCOs went up to the line for instruction by 1st and 2nd Royal Marine Light Iinfantry. Two companies then went into the front line and two into the reserve positions (the Eski Line) on 17 October. The 2/2nd were relieved by the 2/4th Londons on 20 October, after which the two battalions began a rotation with one week in the line alternating with a week's 'rest' in flooded camps in the rear as part of 1st Royal Naval Brigade.Grey, pp. 65‚Äì7.Grimwade, p. 95. The battalions took no part in offensive operations, but on 15 November the machine gun section of the 2/2nd Londons (four old Vickers-Maxims and two even older Nordenfelt guns), together with rifle fire and bombs, provided flanking fire in support of a limited attack by 52nd (Lowland) Division.Grey, pp. 67‚Äì8. W Beach at Cape Helles, just prior to the evacuation By the end of November the four battalions had each suffered heavy casualties, some from enemy action, but the greater number from sickness and frostbite.Grey, pp. 70, 75.Grimwade, pp. 98‚Äì9. In December the Gallipoli operation began to be shut down. The 29th Division was relocated from Suvla Bay to Cape Helles. The 2/3rd Bn was pulled out of the line on 12 December and after a short rest at Mudros landed at Helles on 16 December. It was followed by 2/1st Bn, which was withdrawn to Mudros on 18 December and landed at V Beach on 26 December. Both battalions provided working parties for Gully Beach and the Eski Line. All four battalions were then evacuated from Helles in detachments between 31 December and 8 January 1916. They were then shipped from Mudros to AlexandriaGrey, pp. 71‚Äì4.Grimwade, pp. 103‚Äì7.Martin, pp. 30‚Äì3. Senussi campaign On return to Egypt, the 2/1st London Bde was attached to the 53rd (Welsh) Division, the two battalions from the 29th Division on 15 January, the two from the RN Division on 22 February.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 119. The 2/4th Bn and two companies of the 2/2nd Bn were then sent to join a force at Minia guarding the Nile against a potential attack by Senussi rebels. The 2/4th Londons' CO (Acting-Lt-Col V.H. Seyd, then Col Vickers Dunfee) commanded a force consisting of the Londons with detachments of Lovat's Scouts, Australian Light Horse, Royal Engineers and an armoured train. The remainder of 2/2nd Londons acted as HQ companies for 'Southern Force' protecting the southern Nile Valley.Grimwade, pp. 107‚Äì12.Grey, pp. 79‚Äì82. The detachments were withdrawn in April 1916 and returned to Alexandria, where the 2/1st London Brigade concentrated under the command of Col Dunfee. Here the 2/2nd finally received Short Lee-Enfields to replace their old long pattern rifles. On 17 April the whole brigade embarked on HMT Transylvania and sailed to Marseilles, disembarking on 24 April.Grimwade, p. 112.Grey, p. 84. Disbandment Once in France, the 2/1st London Brigade moved to Rouen, where it was disbanded and the four battalions broken up for drafting as reinforcements to other units For example, from 5 May the 2/2nd sent large drafts to the 1/2nd, and also to the 1/12th Londons (The Rangers) and the 1/16th Londons (Queen's Westminsters). By 20 June all of the 2/4th Bn had been drafted to the 1/4th Bn. All of these battalions were in the 56th (1/1st London) Division preparing for the Attack on the Gommecourt Salient that opened the Battle of the Somme.Grey, p. 85.Grimwade, pp. 113‚Äì4.MacDonald, pp. 91, 95. Meanwhile, the units of the 173rd (3/1st London) Brigade, training in the UK, were renumbered as the 'New' 2/1st, 2/2nd etc Bns. The brigade had already taken 2/1st London Bde's place in 58th (2/1st London) Division. At the time, the 58th Division was carrying out coast defence duties in East Anglia, but in July 1916 it began battle training on Salisbury Plain and in January 1917 it landed in France, where it fought on the Western Front until the Armistice with Germany in November 1918.Martin, p. 33. Commanders Among the brigade's commander were the following officers:Grimwade, pp. 112‚Äì3. * Col E. FitzG. M.

In the 1950s they continued to travel to South Africa.UK and Ireland, Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878-1960  Buckmaster and Moore  In 1895 Moore was a founding partner of the London firm of stockbrokers, Buckmaster and Moore, with his partner Walter Buckmaster, also educated at Repton. Buckmaster was a keen sportsman and later at Cambridge became Captain of the polo team. He developed into one of the country's leading players, taking part in the 1900 Olympic Games, and a member of the winning team in the International Polo Cup, in 1902. In 1904 Armytage- Moore played for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Hertfordshire at Clarence Park St Albans. As stockbrokers they had developed a good private client business, and were very well connected. They had offices at 64 Cornhill, EC3 and later 52, Bishopsgate, EC2A. One of their partners, Oswald Toynbee ‚Äòfoxy‚Äô Falk, (born 1879), attended Rugby School, then Balliol College Oxford (as an exhibitioner), where his uncle the social philosopher and historian, Arnold Toynbee, once taught. Joining the firm after leaving the Treasury, he began to develop a new view on economics. John Maynard Keynes one of the firm's clients (also Burser of King's College Cambridge), joined with Falk to form a syndicate to speculate in currency movements.Business School Paper on O.T. Falk (Buckmaster & Moore) http://www.ballarat.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/23363/001-2011.pdf Keynes lost his fortune in 1920 with money borrowed from both his father and Falk.

Another partner, Maurice Bonham Carter (born in 1880) was also a Balliol graduate, and sportsman. In addition, he served as the Principal Private Secretary to the politician H. H. Asquith and became a leading figure in the Liberal Party. At one time in the late 1920s the firm employed the young Francis Pakenham, later Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, as well as the young Oxford mathematician J. H. C. Whitehead. Both of which, for different reasons decided the City was not the life for them. Buckmaster died in 1942 and Moore in 1960 and the firm eventually taken over by Credit Suisse Group in 1987. Buckmaster & Moore was renamed and reorganised into broking and fund management operations. The company was dissolved in November 1996.

Originally built in 1886 by Richard Webster QC, (later Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone), he set about improving the estate. He acquired additional land in 1925 and reconstructed the main facade in Queen Anne style. He enhanced the gardens with rare rhododendrons, camellias, azaleas and magnolias.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It became a contributing property of the Civic Center Historic District when it was established in 1988. It now houses administrative offices for Polk County. U. S. Courthouse and Post Office, Des Moines, Iowa, built- 1871, demolished- 1968 History Prior to the opening of this building the post office was located in the old Federal Building at Fifth and Court Avenues, beginning in 1870. A $150,000 appropriation was approved by the United States Congress in legislation passed in 1902 for property for a new post office. A further appropriation was passed in 1904 and in 1906 the first of three appropriations for constructing the building was passed. The building was designed by James Knox Taylor of the United States Treasury Department staff in 1908 and construction began the following year. The building was completed in 1910 for $488,016.67. The post offices was the second building constructed in the Civic Center district and the first structure the federal government provided as part of the City Beautiful Movement project in the city of Des Moines. The post office moved their operations into the building in the spring of 1910. By 1925 the building was becoming too small to house postal operations. The Des Moines architectural firm of Wetherell & Harrison drew up plans in the early 1930s for a large addition to the south, but no money was appropriated for it. Plans for a smaller addition were approved in 1934 and completed the following year. There were plans for another addition to the south, but it was never built. However, a smaller addition, which was torn down in the 1970s, was subsequently built. The post office moved their operations from this building to a larger facility at Second and University Avenues in 1971. The building sat empty until the late 1970s when it was acquired by Polk County. They in turn renovated the building for their use as an office building, which was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Woodburn & O'Neil. The north lobby of the building is preserved and used as a public place for art and historical exhibits. It is known as the Polk County Heritage Gallery. Architecture The former post office building is similar in design to the Municipal Court Building across the Des Moines River, which was designed and built at the same time. Both the original building and the 1935 addition are steel frame structures faced with limestone and built on a granite base. It features large semi-circular arched windows, tall smooth columns, simple entablature, massing, materials, and classical detail. The addition continues the massing and restrained design of the original building in a simplified manner that was more popular in the 1930s. The county created a promenade entranceway on the south side of the building when they renovated the structure in the late 1970s.

Many routers come with this option as a standard feature in the setup menu accessed via a web browser. Although network cloaking may stop some inexperienced users from gaining access to your AP, for this class of users, network cloaking is less effective than using static WEP (which itself is vulnerable, see Wired Equivalent Privacy). If the goal is to secure the wireless network, it is recommended to use WPA or preferably WPA2.. WEP, WPA, WPA2, and other encryption technologies can be used in conjunction with hiding the SSID if so desired. Advantages =Sense of security= Hiding the network name may prevent less technically inclined people from connecting to the network, but will not deter a determined adversary. Use of WPA or WPA2 is recommended instead. Hiding the SSID removes it from beacon frames, but this is only one of several ways an SSID can be discovered. When one chooses to hide the network name from the router's setup page, that only sets the SSID in the beacon frame to null, but there remain four other ways that the SSID is transmitted. In fact, hiding broadcast of the SSID on the router may cause the Network interface controller (NIC) to constantly disclose the SSID, even when out of range. =Usability improvement= Hiding the network name improves the experience users connecting to wireless networks in dense areas. When network is not intended for public use and does not broadcast its SSID, it will not appear in a list of available networks on clients. This simplifies the choice for users. Organizations may choose to cloak the WiFi SSID intended to be used by employees and pre-configured on corporate devices while keep networks intended for visitors (i.e., \\"Guest networks\\") broadcasting SSID. This way, authorized users will connect to the corporate network as pre-configured while visitors will only see the \\"Guest network\\" and will be less confused about what SSID to use. Disadvantages =False sense of security= Although network cloaking may add a small sense of security, it is common for people not to realize just how easy it is to discover hidden networks. Because of the various ways an SSID is broadcast, network cloaking is not considered a security measure. Using encryption, preferably WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA2, is more secure. Even WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), while weak and vulnerable, provides more security than hiding the SSID. There are many programs that are able to scan for wireless networks, including hidden ones, and display their information such as IP addresses, SSIDs, and encryption types. These programs are capable of \\"sniffing\\" out any wireless networks in range by essentially eavesdropping and analyzing network traffic and packets to gather information about those specific networks. The reason these programs can sniff out the hidden networks is because when the SSID is transmitted in the various frames, it is displayed in cleartext (unencrypted format), and therefore able to be read by anyone who has found it. An eavesdropper can passively sniff the wireless traffic on that network undetected (with software like Kismet), and wait for someone to connect, revealing the SSID. Alternatively, there are faster (albeit detectable) methods where a cracker spoofs a \\"disassociate frame\\" as if it came from the wireless bridge, and sends it to one of the clients connected; the client immediately re-connects, revealing the SSID. Video demo of active and passive SSID uncloaking. Some examples of these sniffing programs include the following: Passive: * KisMAC * Kismet * Prads * ESSID-Jack Active: * NetStumbler * inSSIDer The downside of passive scanning is that in order to gather any information, a client already connected to that specific network needs to be generating and therefore providing network traffic to be analyzed. These programs are then able to discover the cloaked networks and their SSIDs through picking through frames of information such as: * Probe request frames. Probe request frames are sent unencrypted by the client computer when trying to connect to a network. This unprotected frame of information, which can easily be intercepted and read by someone willing, will contain the SSID. * Probe response frames. In response to the probe request, the requested station will send back a frame of information also containing the SSID as well as other details about the network. * Association request frames. An association request frame is what begins the process of initializing a relationship between the computer and the access point. Once associated properly, the AP will be able to assign some of its resources to the network interface controller (NIC). Once again, through this process, the SSID is transmitted. * Re-association request frames. Re- association request frames are transmitted when a NIC notices a stronger signal from another access point and switches over from the previous one. This new access point will then \\"take over\\" and handle the data that may still be caught up in the previous session. The request of a new connection to a new beacon signal will of course require the transmission of a new SSID. Because of these multiple ways the network name is still being broadcast while the network is \\"cloaked,\\" it is not completely hidden from persistent hackers. Worse still, because a station must probe for a hidden SSID, a fake access point can offer a connection. Note: Here the term \\"non-broadcast\\" means a network that does not broadcast its SSID or broadcasts a null-SSID instead of the actual SSID. Programs that act as fake access points are freely available; e.g. airbase-ng Demonstrates the use of \\"airbase-ng\\" to respond to any probe request beacons. and Karma. Demonstrates the use of \\"Karma\\" to respond to any probe request beacons.

The movement started in July 2011 to prevent rolling blackouts during the summer due to electricity shortages in eastern Japan. Specifically, setsuden was largely in reaction to the aftermath of March 2011 when the Fukushima nuclear plant faced a meltdown after it was damaged by the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. Following the shutdown of the Fukushima power plant, other nuclear plants were also decommissioned indefinitely for maintenance checks, further reducing the nation's nuclear power supply.Rubin, Jeffrey \\"Setsuden Poised to Replace Nuclear Power in Japan \\"\\"The Huffington Post\\", 4 August 2011. Retrieved 6 February 2011 In response to this energy shortage, media campaigns promoted Japanese households and businesses to cut back on electrical usage. While the movement started as an unofficial one, on July 1, 2011, the government passed energy-restriction policies for large companies and target reductions for households and smaller businesses. Although these restrictions were repealed in September 2011, the movement has been successful in preventing blackouts for its span. Origin Nuclear power plants originally supplied around 30% of energy around Japan before the March 11 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and prompted safety checks of other power plants. Including the Fukushima plant, most of the nuclear reactors shut down were owned by Tokyo Electric Power Company(TEPCO), one of Japan's major energy suppliers and leading sources of nuclear power Obe, Mitsuru \\"Japan Girds for Summer Power Cuts\\"\\"Wall Street Journal\\", 20 January 2012. \\"Business\\" Retrieved on 213 February 2012. The March earthquake, combined with a meltdown of the Fukushima plant caused the initial widespread blackouts in affected parts of Japan; since then, TEPCO has not recovered and estimated it would be unable to provide enough electricity to meet the peak demand of the 2011 summer. The damage from the earthquake to the Fukushima Daiichi reactor prompted stress tests of the nation's other fifty-four nuclear reactors; the tests were meant to inspect the resilience of the other reactors in case of another earthquake or tsunami. All of the reactors decommissioned for stress tests and safety checks were yet to be reactivated for usage;\\"Bright ideas needed\\"\\"The Economist\\", \\"Business\\", 17 September 2012.

She taught at Bedford College in the University of London from 1897 to 1933. She was the first British woman to earn a PhD in psychology and the first British woman to be named a professor of psychology. She was also the first female president of the British Psychological Society, the Aristotelian Society, the Mind Association and the Psychological Division of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.  Early life and education  Edgell was born in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England, in 1871, the youngest of six children of Edward Higginson Edgell and his wife, the former Sarah Ann Buckle. Edward Edgell was a bank manager in Tewkesbury. Beatrice Edgell's mother died when her youngest daughter was 11 years old. She attended Tewkesbury High School for Girls between the ages of 10 to 14. In 1886 she went to Notting Hill High School for Girls, leaving in 1891 to enter University College Wales, Aberystwyth, where she studied mainly philosophy. She earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mental and Moral sciences from the University of London in 1894. From 1894 to 1897 Edgell taught high school in Sunderland and Blackburn, earning a teaching diploma from the University of London in 1896. In 1897 she returned to study in Aberystwyth, where her alma mater had become part of the University of Wales. In 1898 she earned a BA in philosophy from the University of Wales, followed in 1899 by a Master of Arts degree from the same university. Edgell spent the 1900‚Äì01 winter semester and the 1901 summer semester at the University of W√ºrzburg, supported by a travelling research fellowship from the University of Wales. Under the supervision of Oswald K√ºlpe, she wrote a doctoral dissertation entitled Die Grenzen des Experiments als einer psychologischen Methode, which was \\"a theoretical discussion of the limits of the experiment as a method in psychology\\". She defended her dissertation successfully on 30 July 1901, thereby becoming the first woman to earn a doctoral degree from the University of W√ºrzburg and the first British woman to be awarded a PhD in psychology by any university.  Career  In January 1898 Edgell had begun her university teaching career at Bedford College in London as lecturer in philosophy and head of the department of mental and moral science, which became the department of philosophy and psychology in 1906. When she returned in 1901 from her year's leave of absence at the University of W√ºrzburg, she set up one of Britain's first psychological laboratories at the college. Beatrice Edgell was named professor of psychology in 1927 by the University of London. She was the first female professor of psychology in Britain. Edgell's early research projects included collaborating with the physiologist William Legge Symes to calibrate the Wheatstone-Hipp chronoscope, a piece of equipment used in experimental psychology to measure reaction time. She later undertook a large-scale empirical study of memory with 1,200 children between the ages of 8 and 12 as the primary subjects. Among her publications were an article on memory in the 1929 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and her 1924 book Theories of Memory. She wrote two textbooks, Mental Life and Ethical Problems, introducing applied psychology to social studies and nursing students respectively. Edgell was one of the earliest members of the British Psychological Society, and presented a paper on time judgement at the association's fifth meeting in 1903. She was the first woman president of the British Psychological Society, a position she held from 1930 to 1932. In 1932 she became the first woman president of the Psychological Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Edgell retained her connection with philosophy, becoming a member of the Aristotelian Society in 1910. In 1930 she became the society's first woman president. Her presidential address presented an analysis of the concept of the \\"image\\" from both a philosophical and psychological point of view. She also became the first woman president of the Mind Association in 1927. Edgell taught at Bedford College for 35 years, retiring in 1933. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes her as a \\"standard-bearer for psychology\\" and a \\"conscientious and painstaking teacher who cared deeply about the education, welfare, and future careers of her students.\\" In 1924 the University of Wales awarded her the degree of Doctor of Letters. On her retirement she was named emeritus professor of psychology.  Later years  Edgell retired to Bishop's Cleeve in Gloucestershire, where she lived with her unmarried brother and sister. She worked in a local child guidance clinic and acted as an examiner in psychology for the Royal College of Nursing, as well as remaining active in professional associations including the British Psychological Society. Edgell died of cancer, in Cheltenham, on 10 August 1948.  Legacy  Edgell's obituary in the British Journal of Psychology stated that \\"the success of her work is demonstrated by the success of her students in many widely differing fields.\\" Among her students who became notable psychologists were Molly Harrower, Winifred Raphael, and Olive Wheeler. The University of W√ºrzburg Faculty of Human Sciences's annual award for the best dissertation by a female PhD student is named the Beatrice Edgell Award in honour of the first woman to receive a doctoral degree from the university.

It was formed by the marriage of Mieszko I (prince of Poland) and Dobrawa of Bohemia (princess of Bohemia). The alliance contributed to the Christianization of Poland and subsequently provided many advantages, such as offering an escape from the control of Germans and giving the Polish more land and influence. However, the pact did not last long and it broke shortly after the death of Dobrawa of Bohemia.  Background  Mieszko I, prince of Poland, wanted to expand the land and gain more influence in Europe. However, the task was hard to achieve at the time since Poland was still Pagan and surrounded by Christian nations such as Germany and Bohemia. The German emperor Otto I had intentions of converting Pagan lands to Christianity and to control them. Mieszko I wanted to avoid being controlled by the emperor and so he sought help from the Bohemians and they formed an alliance. The Bohemians joined the alliance because at the time it was very advantageous to them as it provided them more security.  Conditions of alliance  Bohemia was already Christian when the alliance was formed and so Dobrawa of Bohemia, who married Mieszko I as a part of the alliance, saw it as one of her main goals to Christianize her husband and his nation. Christianization of Poland was a condition of the alliance. Mieszko I got baptized in 966 and the nation soon followed his footsteps. Christianization of Poland is marked as the nation's birth and is considered one of the most important dates in Polish history.  Effects of alliance  The alliance helped Poland and Bohemia escape from the potential control of the Germans as well as to get away from the possible aggressions coming from other states. It also contributed to Christianization of Poland, which helped Mieszko I gain more foreign cultural experience and adopt certain elements of state organization. The alliance improved external and internal affairs. The country was more united and organized. The alliance also helped Mieszko I obtained Western Pomerania, a country at the mouth of the river Odra which played an extremely important role in commerce and economy in the ninth and tenth centuries. The alliance gave advantages to the Bohemians as well. It safeguarded their land beyond the Carpathians and also gave them an opportunity to extend their political and religious influence to the Slavic states. Aftermath Polish-Bohemian cooperation started to fall after Dobrawa's death in 977, and turned into an all out war in a decade (the Polish-Bohemian War of 990).

It is part of the Civic Center Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History The United States District Court for the District of Iowa was established on March 3, 1845. It was divided into the Northern and Southern Districts on July 20, 1882. Des Moines became the headquarters for the Southern District and in 1902 there were discussions that the riverfront would be a suitable location for a new Federal Courthouse. While other sites were considered in 1913 when funds were allocated for a new courthouse, the riverfront was still the desired location. Property was purchased in 1918, but there was a desire for more land so construction was delayed until it was purchased in 1926. The building was designed by and constructed under the direction of the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. The courthouse joined other buildings in a Civic Center district that flanks the Des Moines River. Their placement reflects the City Beautiful Movement, which upheld the notions of civic patriotism, urban economics and beauty. The building opened in 1929. Not only did it house space for the court, but also War, Justice, Navy, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Treasury and the United States Post Office departments. The building has subsequently been turned over to the courts and the other departments have moved to another office building downtown. An annex building was constructed to the south of the courthouse in 1995. A landmark legal decision was made in the courthouse in 1979. Judge William Stuart held that the federal government has the right to legislate travel by long trucks on interstate highways that are maintained by federal funding. The decision was upheld by the United States Supreme Court. By 2015 the Southern District of Iowa had determined that the courthouse does not have adequate space, there are not enough courtrooms, and there are security concerns. A spending bill approved by President Barack Obama in December 2015 provided money for a new federal courthouse in Des Moines, but its location, cost and schedule to open have not been determined. Architecture The courthouse complex occupies an entire city block with its main fa√ßade on Walnut Street. The building is four stories tall and built on a raised basement. While it appears to be rectangular in shape, it is actually E-shaped. The Classical Revival style building is a steel-framed structure covered in Indiana limestone. The raised basement is ashlar limestone and features flat-arched window openings. The piano nobile is finished with rusticated limestone and has semi-circular arched window openings that are ornamented with keystones. The top two stories feature two-story Corinthian columns and pilasters. The top floor has paneled pilasters and a banded cornice. The main fa√ßade is 19-bays wide with slightly projecting pavilions on both corners. Like the exterior, the interior also reflects the Classical Revival style. The main entrance was relocated to the basement level to accommodate everyone regardless of disability. The entrance opens into the main foyer, which contains the original gold, black, and white speckled terrazzo flooring framed by a base of red Verona marble. The grand staircase is composed of Napoleon gray marble treads and buff-colored marble risers. The balustrade is made of cast iron and features vine-like curved scrolls with floral accents, fitted between bands of floral discs and squares. A mural is located above the lower stairs and portrays pioneers and a blacksmith. It is possibly a Works Project Administration commission. A plaster coffered ceiling completes the entrance hall. The main courtroom on the second floor was restored in 1988. It still maintains its original floor bordered in pink Tennessee marble and a coffered ceiling. The walls are plastered to look like travertine ashlar masonry. The judge's bench sits on top of a platform of pink Tennessee marble. It sits in front of an alcove flanked by two Corinthian columns. Above the bench are the words, Justitia Omnibus (Justice for All).

Biography The family name was originally spelled \\"Peijster,\\" \\"Peister,\\" or \\"Pester.\\" De Peyster came of a French Huguenot family that took refuge in the United Provinces about the time of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. He emigrated to New Amsterdam on account of religious persecution. During the brief period in 1673-74 in which the Dutch regained possession of New Netherland, he took a prominent part in the conduct of public affairs, and he was one of the last to take the oath of allegiance to the British crown on the final cession of the province to that power. Notwithstanding his tardiness in taking an oath of allegiance, he still continued active in municipal affairs under English rule. At different times, he served as alderman and deputy mayor, but he refused the mayoralty on account of his ignorance of English. At the time of his death, he was one of the wealthiest citizens of the province. Family Johannes married Cornelia \\"Neeltje\\" Lubberts (aka de Peijster, de Peyster, van Elburch) in 1651 in New York City.

It was created by the U.S. Congress in 1984 and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Topography The Hellsgate Wilderness is on the edge of the Mogollon Rim. The elevation change in the wilderness is , with the highest point being Horse Mountain in the northeast corner. Tonto Creek is a perennial creek that cuts a canyon through the wilderness. The terrain is subject to steep elevation changes throughout the entire wilderness area. Wildlife Due to available water, the Hellsgate Wilderness is home to myriad animal life, including black bears, mountain lions, mule deer, coyotes, gray foxes, javelinas, and, beavers. Trout, catfish, and smallmouth bass live in the perennial creeks. History The southern part of the Hellsgate Wilderness was home to the native American group known as the Salado. This civilization flourished along the banks of the Salt River in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the later part of the 14th century, the Salado went into decline and by 1400 the Hellgate Wilderness area was largely abandoned. Sometime in the 16th century, the Apache began using this area for a hunting ground and continued to do so until they were driven out by ranchers and miners of European descent. In 1927, a Ryan Brougham airplane flown by Martin Jensen, carrying MGM's Leo the Lion, was forced to make an emergency landing in a box canyon in the Hellsgate Wilderness. Both pilot and lion survived with no injuries, and the canyon was named Leo Canyon after the incident. The wreckage of the plane was left in the canyon until 1991, when historic-airplane enthusiast Scott Gifford found it and removed it from the canyon via helicopter. He plans to restore the plane to airworthiness. Recreation The Hellgsate Wilderness contains many trails for hiking as well as camping spots. However, usage of this area is light as trailheads are difficult to reach without 4-wheel-drive capability, and most trails are rated as challenging. During the summer months, the wilderness's perennial creeks attract a small number of anglers.

It had an estimated population of 18,676 as of 2012. The city of Kinzau-Mvuete is in the Bundi sector of Seke-Banza Territory. It is at a crossroads, and is a center of trade for the territory with large urban centers such as Muanda, Boma, Matadi and Kinshasa. In June 2007 it was reported that the road running north from Kinzao to Seke-Banza was in an advanced state of deterioration following torrential rains. The authorities were planning to raise money to fill the potholes through tolls. The area around the town has been illegally deforested, with the wood used to make charcoal or as lumber for construction. In 2009 it was reported that poaching was widespread in the nearby Mayumbe forest, with villagers killing any animal they could catch and smoking the meat for sale. Some species such as wild boar and porcupine were at risk of being wiped out in the region. The Higher Institute of Rural Development (ISDR) in Kinzau Mvuete was founded in 1993 and opened in February 1994. It provides training in practical agricultural techniques. As of February 2009 there were recurrent shortages of drinking water due to lack of supply pumps. Education on family planning is lacking, and sexual violence is common.

History This painting illustrates the Song of Solomon. Two passages from the Song of Solomon are inscribed on the picture's gilded frame: > My beloved is mine and I am his (2:16) and > Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than > wine (1:2) The bride, caught in the action of moving back her veil, is attended by four virginal bridesmaids and an African page boy. All contrast strikingly with the red hair and pale skin of the bride: not just the African skin and features, but also the varying shades of brunette hair and dark caucasian skin tones of all four bridesmaids. It has been suggested that this colour contrast, carefully painted as a frame to the bride's features, was influenced by a controversial painting by √âdouard Manet, entitled Olympia (first exhibited in 1865). Rossetti made a visit to Manet while working on The Beloved, and the painting also owes much to the works of Titian.J. Treuherz, E. Prettejohn, and E. Becker. Dante Gabriel Rossetti. London: Thames & Hudson (2003). Rossetti arranged the bride in a head-dress which is distinctly recognisable as Peruvian, and in a Japanese gown. Again, this abundance of exotic fabric frames the face of the bride, dominant in the centre of the canvas, with its western-European features. Rossetti ostensibly finished this oil in 1866, but continued to make changes to it throughout his life.V. Surtees. Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Vol.I, Oxford: Clarendon Press (1971).

LAWG and its sister organization, the Latin America Working Group Education Fund, work with over 60 major religious, humanitarian, grassroots and policy organizations to influence decision makers in Washington, D.C. History In 1983, seeking to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Central America and to U.S. policies that backed armies that slaughtered civilians, U.S. churches, grassroots and policy groups sought a coordinated way to respond. Working out of borrowed office space, with one or two paid staff, the Central America Working Group, as it was then called, served to organize, educate, and inspire activists advocating peace and justice in Central America. CAWG developed allies in Congress, the media and the public to end military assistance to the Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments and the Nicaraguan Contras.http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG176-200/dg184lawg.htm After the wars ended, CAWG coordinated efforts to encourage implementation of historic peace agreements and support the search for truth by helping to spur the declassification of thousands of U.S. documents for Central American truth commissions. In the early 1990s, the groups participating in CAWG coalition decided, rather than to disband, to expand their issues, becoming the Latin America Working Group. The LAWG has worked since then to call for disaster relief and development aid to the region, successfully lift the embargo on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, lift the restrictions on Cuban-American travel and advocate for an end to the full travel ban,http://informacioncivica.info/case-study/case-study-end-the-travel-ban-on- cuba/ cut military aid and increase humanitarian aid to Colombia,http://lawg.org/our-campaigns/stand-by-colombias-victims-of-violence/ Colombia's Victims of Violence support the struggle for fair elections in Mexico,http://lawg.org/our-campaigns/promote-justice-for-mexico-and-the- borderlands/ Justice for Mexico and the Borderlands and advocate for just border policies that recognize the human rights of migrants and border communities. LAWG is organized as a 501 (c) 4 nonprofit, which carries out advocacy, while its affiliated organization, the Latin America Working Group Education Fund, a 501 (c) 3 nonprofit, carries out educational activities. Achievements LAWG was involved in opposing the U.S. role in Central American wars during the 1980s and in supporting the negotiated peace settlements that took hold in the region by the 1990s. Since then, LAWG gained U.S. support to implement Central American peace accords and to declassify documents that shed light on human rights abuses in Latin America and U.S. policies. LAWG helped secure several billion dollars in U.S. disaster relief in the wake of earthquakes and hurricanes that devastated Central America and Haiti.

Life and career Hilda Oakeley was born in 1867 in Durham, UK. She was from a privileged upper- middle-class background. Her father, Sir Evelyn Oakeley was a member of a Shropshire gentry family. He and his wife Caroline (n√©e Turner) had five children. In 1878 her father was promoted and the family moved to Manchester. Hilda attended the private Ellerslie Ladies' College. After finishing school she moved to London and independently studied philosophy and psychology. She attended some of the lectures of the philosopher Bernard Bosanquet and after winning a prize for an essay on Aristotle, the examiners persuaded her to apply to go to Oxford University. In 1894 at the comparatively late age of 27, Hilda Oakeley went to Somerville College, Oxford to read Greats. She received a first class degree in 1898, although it was not until 1920 when women were admitted as full members of Oxford University, that she was awarded it. After leaving Oxford, she became the first Warden of the new Royal Victoria College at McGill University, Canada. This was a Canada's first residential college for women. She taught philosophy in the faculty of arts and in 1900 she was the first woman to deliver McGill's annual university lecture on ‚ÄòHistory and progress‚Äô. In 1905 Oakeley returned to England and was appointed lecturer in philosophy to women students at Manchester University. Two years later she moved back to London, where her parents lived and took a post as Warden of King's College for Women, University of London, and as lecturer in philosophy. When in 1915, the college turned coeducational and the women's department closed, she retained a part-time lecturership in philosophy at King's. In 1921 she returned to King's as a university reader in philosophy. In 1928 she was awarded the London degree of DLitt. She was subsequently Acting Head of the philosophy department there from 1925 to 1930 and head of the department in 1931. She retired in 1931. Oakeley wrote more than forty articles in philosophical journals on a wide variety of topics including time, history, ethics, political philosophy, and idealism. She published six books of philosophy. She also published her memoirs, My Adventures in Education (1939); and a volume of poetry, A Philosopher‚Äôs Rhyme and other Stray Verses (1937). She was president of the Aristotelian Society for 1940‚Äì1941 and was vice- president of the British Federation of University Women from 1909 until her death. She died in London on 7 October 1950.

After being signed as an amateur free agent by the Red Sox in 2009, Bogaerts made his MLB debut in 2013, appearing in 30 games between the regular season and postseason, and helping the Red Sox to the World Series championship. He became the Red Sox' starting shortstop in 2014, and was awarded the American League's Silver Slugger Award at the position in back to back years, 2015 and 2016, and again in 2019. Professional career =Minor leagues= Mike Lord, a scout for the Boston Red Sox, discovered Bogaerts at the age of 16, in 2009. After not playing baseball for two weeks due to the chicken pox, Bogaerts played for Lord, who recommended him to Craig Shipley, the Red Sox' vice president of international scouting. Shipley flew to Aruba to watch Bogaerts play. The Red Sox signed him to a contract with a $410,000 signing bonus. Bogaerts made his professional debut in 2010 in the Dominican Summer League (DSL), where he had a .314 batting average, .396 on-base percentage, and .423 slugging percentage. He led the DSL Red Sox in each of those categories, along with hits (75), home runs (3), RBIs (42), and total bases (101). He was fifth in the DSL in RBIs and tenth in total bases, and he had a .929 fielding percentage. The next year, at age 18, Bogaerts played for the Greenville Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League, where he had a slash line of .260/.324/.509, fielded .924, and hit 16 home runs in 72 games. During the 2012 season, Bogaerts started out in Class A and ended up playing with the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League. He was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game. Heading into the 2013 season, Bogaerts ranked sixth in the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects list, eighth in the Baseball America Top 100 Prospects list, and was ranked the fifth-best prospect by ESPN's Keith Law, who described him as \\"Still just 20 years old, Bogaerts has been playing solid shortstop for Portland with a solid walk rate but isn't yet generating the power expected from his explosive swing.\\"\\"Bogaerts, Cecchini in Law's Top 25\\", ESPN (ESPNBoston.com), May 28, 2013 =Boston Red Sox= 2013‚Äì2015 Bogaerts celebrating the 2013 World Series championship Bogaerts started the season with Portland and was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Triple-A International League in mid-June.

He got his first major league hit five days later against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 7, Bogaerts hit his first MLB home run against New York Yankees pitcher Jim Miller.\\"Profile: Xander Bogaerts\\", ESPN At the end of the 2013 Minor League season, Bogaerts gained USA Today Minor League Player of the Year honors and was named to the 2013 Baseball America Minor League All-Star Team. During his brief stint in the majors in 2013, Bogaerts appeared in 18 games batting .250 with a home run, five RBIs, and a stolen base. Despite debuting late in the season, Bogaerts was part of the 25-man active roster during the postseason run. Bogaerts had a strong performance in the postseason as he batted .296 with two RBIs in 12 postseason games, eventually leading to the Red Sox winning their eighth World Series in franchise history. Bogaerts also became the youngest player to hit a triple in World Series history. Bogaerts began the 2014 season as the starting shortstop for Boston. On May 29, Bogaerts had his first walk- off plate appearance on a throwing error by Atlanta Braves third baseman Chris Johnson, allowing Red Sox outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. to score. On June 2, the Red Sox re-signed Stephen Drew and Bogaerts was moved back to third base. Bogaerts returned to shortstop once again when the Red Sox sent Drew to the rival New York Yankees at the trading deadline on July 31. For the season, Bogaerts played 99 games at shortstop and 44 games at third base, while batting .240 with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs. In 2015, Bogaerts led the Red Sox with a career-high .320 average (along with seven home runs and 81 RBIs), finishing second only to Miguel Cabrera for the American League batting title. From late July, Bogaerts began to bat second or third exclusively. He had 10 hits with the bases loaded, the most in MLB for 2015. He received the American League's Silver Slugger Award for shortstop. On top of his breakout offense, Bogaerts was also a finalist for the Rawlings Gold Glove Award at shortstop. 2016‚Äìpresent Bogaerts with the Red Sox in 2016 In 2016, Bogaerts again began the season as the Red Sox' starting shortstop, primarily batting third. Between May 6 and June 2, Bogaerts hit safely in 26 consecutive games. His hitting streak came to an end in a loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on June 3. He was chosen to play in the 2016 MLB All-Star Game, the first of his career; he started at shortstop and was 1-for-2 at the plate.

On April 1, 2019, the Red Sox announced that they signed Bogaerts to a six-year contract extension worth $132 million. On July 3, MLB announced that Bogaerts had been selected for the 2019 All-Star Game. On September 7, Bogaerts registered his 1,000th MLB career hit, in a game against the New York Yankees.

Rock classics... the whole history of rock music‚Äîblues, rock and roll, Latin jazz, surf music\\". The song credits acknowledge some of the writers of the original songs. According to biographer Stephen Davis, the song began as a jam in the studio after a night out dining and drinking at a local Mexican restaurant: \\"the band played free-form R&B;, improvising about the death of rock and roll\\". He added the song was: A heavily edited version lasting 16:30 was released on The Doors: Box Set in 1997 and the 50th Anniversary Edition of The Soft Parade contains the complete 64:03 version. Critical reception In an AllMusic review of The Doors Box Set, critic Bruce Eder commented: \\"the 16-and-half-minute jam/rap (including a reference to 'Mystery Train') from the Morrison Hotel sessions, entitled 'Rock Is Dead,' where, fueled on wine and good food, they let the tape roll on this astonishing extended musical moment.

The group is based around a wiki, which enables people to register their own tree planting events, to find like-minded friends in their region, and to network with foresters and other tree experts. , events have taken place in Berlin, Brandenburg, G√∂ttingen, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany as well as in H√ÆrbovƒÉ»õ in Moldova. It is hoped that the idea will spread, with further volunteers getting involved in organising tree planting events using the WikiWoods software as a coordinating platform. WikiWoods plants according to a set of sustainability guidelines that were specially developed for the group. The events that have been carried out so far include afforestation, the conversion of monoculture coniferous forests into mixed woodland, the planting of hedges and forest edges, as well as the planting, harvesting, and pruning of fruit trees. In order to ensure the future protection of the trees that are planted, WikiWoods works with environmental partners who provide the land and take responsibility for their ongoing care. Partner organizations include WWF, BUND, NABU National Heritage Foundation (), and the Lower Oder Valley National Park. WikiWoods is supported by sponsor organization Active Commonse.V., which provides funds for planting projects and the operation of the Internet platform. WikiWoods is a member of the Climate-Alliance Germany.  Selected activities  In 2009, WikiWoods started a new area of activity, namely the planting of fruit trees. In May 2009, the mayor of the Berlin district of Kreuzberg Franz Schulz and member of the German Parliament Hans-Christian Str√∂bele (Green Party) helped WikiWoods plant 10fruit trees at , Berlin. 2010 saw WikiWoods campaigning against the controversial carbon capture and storage (CCS) pilot projects planned for Beeskow, Neutrebbin, and Letschin. The 'Trees instead of store' () campaign was attended by politicians including Dagmar Enkelmann (Die Linke) and Hans- Georg von der Marwitz (CDU/CSU). In 2011, several WikiWoods projects were undertaken through the Youth in Action (Jugend in Aktion) program, funded by the European Union. WikiWoods reacted to the devastating sandstorm of 9April 2011 in the German federal state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania by planting wind protection hedges. These newly planted hedges should help to alleviate soil erosion in the future.  Awards  WikiWoods has been awarded several prizes.

After minor success as an actor, Stange made his career as a writer in the musical theatre, moving towards more varied theatrical work before his death. Early career He was born in Liverpool, England. He emigrated to America in 1881 and attempted to establish himself as an actor and elocution teacher, teaching the Delsarte technique of acting. One of his pupils was Alice Nielsen, for whom he later wrote shows.Dall Wilson, Alice Nielsen and the Gayety of Nations, 2008, p.144. He worked with a drama club in Kansas City, where he acted in and directed The Bells and Richard III. He later toured with George C. Milne, Stuart Robson and William H.

He finally moved to New York, where he had more success as a writer.Gerald Bordman, \\"Stange, Stanislaus\\", The Oxford companion to American theatre, Oxford University Press, 1984. He teamed up with composer Julian Edwards to create a string of musicals, beginning with Madeline, or the Magic Kiss (1895), a romantic fantasy in which an old man magically gets younger every time he is kissed.Julian Edwards, \\"A Composer of Light Opera who has recently become famous\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, October 30, 1896, p. 23.

However, her \\"kiss of love\\" breaks the spell.Bordman, Gerald Martin. American musical theatre: a chronicle, Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 132; 281 The show was a big success. With Edwards, Stange later created Brian Boru (1896), The Wedding Day (1897), The Jolly Musketeer (1898), and When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1902), which produced a popular patriotic song, \\"My Own United States\\". Stange also worked with other composers, including Victor Herbert, for whom he wrote the book of the musical The Singing Girl, the plot of which borrows from Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado.Gould, Neil (2008). Victor Herbert: A Theatrical Life. Fordham University Press, p. 302 This was a vehicle for Stange's old pupil Alice Nielsen. In 1904 he wrote The Two Roses, for music by Ludwig Engl√§nder. Louise Le Baron starred in the main role. The libretto was adapted from Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer. Later work His biggest success was his dramatization of the novel Quo Vadis? (1900). He also translated and adapted Oscar Straus's operetta, The Chocolate Soldier (1909), which he also directed. This achieved the longest run of all his works. In 1910 Stange's play The Girl with the Whooping Cough caused controversy because of its allegedly salacious content. After intervention from the mayor of New York all performances on Broadway were stopped. Drama critic George Jean Nathan called the play \\"nauseating and ... disgusting in its futile efforts to be risqu√©\\". In 1912 Stange suffered a stroke when working on a production of The Chocolate Soldier. His health and productivity declined from that point. He died at the age of 54 on January 2, 1917.Stanislaus Stange is Dead, The Spokesman Review, 3 January 1917, p.2. His son, Hugh Stanislaus Stange was also a successful playwright and screenwriter.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1987 through Enigma Records. It marked a stylistic shift for the band, who departed from their earlier gothic rock and hard rock efforts in favor of a glam metal persona and sound. Hit and Run was T.S.O.L.'s only release to chart, reaching no. 184 on the Billboard 200, but the band's new direction alienated their fans in vast numbers and was criticized by reviewers. Enigma found the album difficult to market due to the group's change in musical style and image. It failed to be the commercial breakthrough the members had hoped for, and T.S.O.L. left Enigma as a result. Background and recording On their 1986 album Revenge, T.S.O.L. had begun to move away from the punk- and gothic rock-influenced sound of their past in favor of simpler rock numbers influenced by the growing hard rock scene in their native Southern California. Hit and Run was an even further departure, as they adopted a look and sound reflecting the popular glam metal of the era. The album was recorded at Music Grinder Studios and Preferred Sound Studios in Hollywood with recording engineer Jim Faraci and Revenge producer Howard Benson. It includes a cover version of \\"Good Mornin' Blues', originally performed by the 1930s/1940s blues artist Lead Belly, which features additional instrumentation in the form of saxophone, congas, and harmonica. The song \\"You Can Try\\" was dedicated to guitarist Ron Emory's brother William, who died of a heroin overdose in 1986 at age 29. Hit and Run was released July 11, 1987 through Enigma Records (catalog number 73263), and T.S.O.L. supported it by touring with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Guns N' Roses. They became friends with Guns N' Roses, whose were rising to stardom on the success of their platinum-selling debut album Appetite for Destruction, released ten days after Hit and Run. T.S.O.L.'s opening spot on their tour dates, coupled with Guns N' Roses drummer Steven Adler wearing a T.S.O.L. T-shirt in the music video for \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\", brought T.S.O.L. increased attention: \\"I hear more people telling me about seeing our T-shirt every day than anything else we've ever done\\", said bassist Mike Roche in 1988. Reception Hit and Run became T.S.O.L.'s only release to chart, reaching no. 184 on the Billboard 200. In the album's liner notes, the band members called it \\"the best record we have done to date. It is in keeping with our ideal of complete freedom in music, as in life itself.\\" Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times wrote in 1988 that it \\"served final notice that the band no longer was playing punk rock. It was a polished, accessible record that consisted mostly of the sort of mainstream, melodic heavy rock that has brought big-time success to bands such as Guns N' Roses and the resurgent Aerosmith.\\" In the fall of 1987 T.S.O.L. travelled to New York City for a showcase concert for representatives from major record labels, hoping to land a major-label deal. No deal came through, a setback that singer/guitarist Joe Wood attributed partly to his problems with drugs and alcohol. The band's shift to glam metal alienated their fans in vast numbers. Enigma Records found Hit and Run difficult to market because T.S.O.L.'s past image as a punk band conflicted with their attempt to break into the heavy rock mainstream: Their core audience was confused, while heavy metal audiences failed to pick up on the album. \\"The people who make rock bands happen see us as that punk band of yesterday\\", said Roche, \\"Our problem now is educating them that we're not a hard-core band or any kind of punk band.\\" Hit and Run failed to be the commercial breakthrough the band hoped for: \\"I thought we'd done it,\\" Roche bemoaned, \\"It was diverse, it was powerful, and it could be played on the radio and sound good. When it didn't [succeed]... I'm used to that kind of thing. It was time to reassess and move on.\\" As a result, T.S.O.L. left Enigma in \\"an amicable split\\", feeling the label viewed them as a band with a cult following but without chart-topping potential. Bradley Torreano and Victor Valdivia of Allmusic were both critical of the album. Torreano called it \\"a sudden departure for the group, seeing them adopt a persona that was in tune with bands such as Poison and Faster Pussycat. This was not only evident in the forced and awkward pictures adorning the album, but more unfortunately in their sound as well.\\" He cited Hit and Run as evidence of creative divisions within the band, remarking that founding members Emory and Roche \\"were clearly uncomfortable with this new direction and their contributions began to suffer because of it.\\" On the other side of the divide were Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, who had joined in 1984. Torreano commented that the album's supporting tours \\"only emphasized the dual personalities the band had developed during this period.\\" Valdivia gave the album two stars out of five, saying \\"Musically, Hit and Run would fit in comfortably with The Cult's Electric (which is fitting since The Cult underwent a similar transformation) or Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction, a rather odd fit from a band that was earlier compared to Bad Religion and even the Dead Kennedys. Unfortunately, T.S.O.L. lacks the clever songwriting, outstanding personality, and superior production that those two albums had.\\" Though he noted some standout moments, he found them \\"few and far between. Too much of this is generic, run-of-the-mill hard rock, without any distinction.\\" Track listing Personnel ;Band *Joe Wood ‚Äì vocals, guitar *Ron Emory ‚Äì guitar *Mike Roche ‚Äì bass guitar *Mitch Dean ‚Äì drums ;Additional musicians *Jamie Segel ‚Äì backing vocals *Andy Landis ‚Äì backing vocals *Bill Bergman ‚Äì saxophone on \\"Good Mornin' Blues\\" *Andrea Carol ‚Äì congas on \\"Good Mornin' Blues\\" ;Production *Howard Benson ‚Äì producer, mix engineer, keyboards *Jim Faraci ‚Äì recording engineer, mix engineer, backing vocals *Matt Freeman ‚Äì assistant engineer *Scott Campbell ‚Äì assistant engineer *Jeff DeMorris ‚Äì assistant engineer *Brian Ayuso ‚Äì art direction, design *Neil Zlozower ‚Äì photography References Category:T.S.O.L. albums Category:1987 albums Category:Enigma Records albums ","title":"Hit and Run (T.S.O.L. album)"},{"id":"34506695","text":"Housewives on the Job () is a 1972 German erotic comedy film directed by Ernst Hofbauer and starring Ingrid Steeger, Marie-Georges Pascal, and Elisabeth Volkmann.Cf.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2000. The historic significance of the district is based on the concentration of bungalows and square houses as well as a mix of subtypes. History The Des Moines Life Insurance Company officially created the Ingersoll Place Plat on September 27, 1906. with At the same time the Ingersoll Run sewer line was put under contract. The of main sewer line brought sewer service to the northwest side of Des Moines. Early residential development began near Ingersoll Park, an amusement park that was located at 42nd Street and Ingersoll until 1911. Housing construction then moved east from there, which is contrary to the city's general east to west movement of development. Ingersoll Avenue also had a streetcar line since 1897, which made the area attractive for development. The Financial Panic of 1905-1906, however, delayed construction. Fifty of the lots were foreclosed on and had to be resold. Architecture A majority of the houses in the district, twenty- four, are square house plans. Front gabled houses number thirteen, eight have hipped roofs and three have side gables. The houses with hip roofs are found in the east end and the front-gables houses are found in the west. The district has five bungalows with front gables; all but one is on Linden Street. Two houses are part of a subtype of bungalows with a hip roof and two have a double gable on the front of the house. Two more houses follow the subtype of a gable front with a gabled side porch. Five more bungalows have side gables. Three are on Linden Street, and there is one each on High and 28th Streets. Three houses feature a subtype of this style has a single roof pitch and full-width front porch. Two more houses have a single roof pitch, offset with a less than full-width front porch. There is also one house that has a double main roof pitch. It also has a combination of American Craftsman and Classical Revival ornamentation. Seven houses are neither bungalows nor square houses. Two houses are a vernacular side gable, story-and-a-half, square house that is popular in Des Moines.

It is notable for being the first aircraft to exceed in level flight.Hallion, Kenneth, Taking Flight, New York: Oxford University Press, 2003, p320 Design and development The 1912 Deperdussin Racer was a high-wing monoplane with unusual wings, being tapered so that their chord was greater at the tips than at the root, possibly to increase the effect of the wing-warping used for lateral control. The fuselage consisted of a wooden box-girder entirely skinned with plywood, with the rounded top and bottom built up from laminations of wood. This type of stressed skin construction, pioneered by the Swiss engineer Eugene Ruchonnet, was extremely advanced for its time, and was followed to its logical conclusion in the Deperdussin Monocoque which appeared later in the year. Great attention was paid to producing an aerodynamically clean design: the tailskid was arranged so that its bungee cord springing was inside the fuselage, the wheels had disks covering the spokes to reduce drag, and the wing-warping control wires were carried inside the inverted-v cabane struts. It was initially powered by a Gnome double Omega 14-cylinder twin-row rotary engine and had an undercarriage with twin skids as well as a pair of wheels, similar to earlier Deperdussin aircraft, and a triangular tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage, together with a triangular fin with an unbalanced rectangular rudder hinged to its trailing edge. It was first flown late in 1911 or early in 1912; Jules V√©drines is recorded as making \\"fast flights\\" in the aircraft on 2 January 1912.

Career H√∂jer was born on 12 August 1890 in Visby, Sweden, the son of Professor Nils H√∂jer and Emmy H√∂jer. He began to study medicine at the Karolinska Institute in 1908 and became a Licentiate of Medicine in 1916. He went to Paris in 1919, where he became acquainted with the nurse Signe Dahl and they later married in 1920. In addition to his work and social commitment, Hojer in the early 1920s researched on vitamin C and its role in connective tissue cell maturation. He submitted his thesis in Stockholm in 1924 for PhD degree as Studies in scurvy, and then became the Associate Professor of Hygiene in the Physiological Institute at Lund University. In 1930, he was appointed as the city physician of Malm√∂ and subsequently, in 1935, became Director General of the National Swedish Board of Health, a post he left in 1952. During his time in the Medical Board, he made several reforms in terms of preventive care, including family planning, maternal assistance and care of infants as well as the dental services. Hojer was appointed in the UN's expert commission for economic affairs and in its housing commission. He was sent as a special officer for improving medical education in India on the request of Travancore-Cochin state (present day Kerala state). Hojer was appointed as the Principal of the Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, a position that he served till 1954. After retirement, he worked on international issues, including the effects of the Vietnam War.  The Hojer Investigation  Axel J. Hojer led Board of Health study in 1948 on the health care reorganization. The study suggested a focus on preventive care and strengthening of provincial medical offices. The proposal was motivated in particular by the fact that the proportion of primary care physicians had declined because of the sharp increase in hospital doctors. The study polemicized Medical Board and Medical Association's view with regard to primary care. Inquiry advocated a polyclinic form, where the reception for outpatient health care would be free and operated by the community. The H√∂jer study was the first and comprehensive attempt to analyze the problems in outpatient care. It suggested establishment of centers of various kinds. The larger centers would include both specialists and general practitioners and was located in hospitals. The minor ones would have two or more GPs and located in provincial stations. Hojer encountered considerable resistance from the medical professionals. He was exposed to virulent press campaign from colleagues calling for his resignation. As a result of complaints the commission's proposals could not be realized.  Controversies  Hojer the combination of pacifism, socialism, anti clericalism, anti-Nazism and temperance led to political persecution in Sydsvenska Dagbladet and Aftonbladet (Swedish newspapers). He was dismissed from a job as the teacher in the South Sweden Nursing School on the ground that he held a lecture on sexual health. As city physician in Malm√∂, he tried to address air pollution from Scanian Cement factory at Limhamn in Malm√∂. Company director threatened Malm√∂ municipality to shift to another location if they followed the town doctor's recommendations. Concerning the Jewish refugees, he met stiff resistance from the management of Swedish medical establishment. When an ophthalmologist named Daniels, after the German occupation of Danzig had to leave his home and searched for a living in Sweden, the medical professionals in the country sued to ban it citing various reasons. An affront campaign with a hint of anti-Semitism was taken up by the medical establishments. When the Medical Board in 1939 planned to invite 12 Jewish specialty physicians to Sweden, the doctors associations protested suggesting it would lead to unemployment. Bollhusmotet, a protest arranged by the student body at Uppsala University also voiced against accepting Jewish refugees. The royal family intervened, and Hojer was called to the ruler, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, with the proposal that Sweden should accept only a small number of Jewish doctors who ran away from Hitler's persecution. \\"He asked me pleadingly to refrain from proposals and actions, which could bring the unity of the Swedish people in danger. I answered respectfully but firmly - in the background listening Marshal of the Court - that I obviously did not want to increase the problems of government, but I found that the request is primarily aimed to appease the anti-Semitic circles. It would be ignominious if Sweden were to disappoint people in danger. The Crown Prince reiterated his warning. I explained I have in mind the future, and would do it if my conscience asks to do so. We parted without further discussion \\". Hojer also asked to increase the number of doctors in the country, by importing Austrian physician in 1950, which again was opposed by the Medical Association.

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals and for the Yokohama DeNA BayStars of the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Career =High school and college= Sol√≠s attended Agua Fria High School in Avondale, Arizona. Playing for the school's baseball team, he had a 7‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record and a 1.77 earned run average (ERA) with 117 strikeouts and 29 walks with 25 hits allowed in innings pitched in his sophomore year. He shared West Valley High School Baseball Player of the Year honors with Kole Calhoun. In his junior year, he had a 4‚Äì4 record and a 1.93 ERA, and recorded 87 strikeouts with 23 walks and 45 hits in innings. While in his junior year, he competed in the American Amateur Baseball Congress and won the 2006 Connie Mack World Series. As a senior, Sol√≠s had an 8‚Äì2 record, a 2.40 ERA, and 98 strikeouts to 43 hits and 23 walks in innings. He was again named West Valley's High School Baseball Co-Player of the Year, along with Cody Cress. Sol√≠s finished his high school career with a 25‚Äì8 win‚Äìloss record and 398 strikeouts, the second-most in Arizona Class 4A history. Solis was also a dual sport athlete playing the varsity football team alongside Minnesota Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen. Baseball America ranked Sol√≠s as the 53rd-best prospect available in the 2007 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Sol√≠s in the 18th round of the draft, but he did not sign in order to play college baseball. Sol√≠s attended the University of San Diego, where he played for the San Diego Toreros baseball team. As a freshman, Sol√≠s had a 3‚Äì1 record and a 3.83 earned run average (ERA) in 17 games pitched, which included seven games started. He pitched for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League in the summer of 2008, pitching largely out of the rotation. Expected to pitch more in 2009 due to San Diego teammate Brian Matusz signing a professional contract, Sol√≠s instead injured his back while weightlifting. He returned as a redshirt sophomore in 2010, and had a 9‚Äì2 record and a 3.42 ERA with 92 strikeouts and 82 hits allowed in 92 innings pitched. He was named All-West Coast Conference. =Washington Nationals= The Washington Nationals selected Sol√≠s in the second round, with the 51st overall selection of the 2010 MLB Draft, and Sol√≠s received a $1 million signing bonus to sign with Washington. Pitching for the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL) after the 2010 regular season, Sol√≠s won the AFL championship. He again pitched in the AFL after the 2011 regular season, when he damaged the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his elbow. Before the 2012 season, MLB.com rated Sol√≠s as the 86th-best prospect in baseball. He had Tommy John surgery to repair the UCL in March 2012 and missed the 2012 season. He returned to Potomac in 2013, and was assigned to the AFL after the 2013 season. After the 2013 season, the Nationals added Sol√≠s to their 40-man roster. He was shut down in June 2014 with discomfort in his elbow after making one start for the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League. Sol√≠s began the 2015 season with Harrisburg. He was promoted to the major leagues on April 29, and made his major league debut the next day. Sol√≠s started the 2016 season at Triple-A Syracuse, but he was called up April 27 after reliever Matt Belisle was injured and placed on the disabled list. Sol√≠s himself spent time on the disabled list in 2016, briefly being listed with knee soreness on July 17 and then being sidelined with left shoulder inflammation from August 17 to September 26. Sol√≠s was regarded as having what an SB Nation writer called \\"something of a breakout season\\" in 2016, pitching to a 2.41 ERA in 41 innings and proving equally effective against hitters on both sides of the plate. He appeared in all five games of the 2016 National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Injuries once again plagued Sol√≠s in the Nationals' 2017 season. Although he started the year in the major league bullpen, he landed on the disabled list on April 19 with left elbow inflammation and struggled after being activated July 1 after an extended rehabilitation stint in the minor leagues. Sol√≠s was optioned back to Syracuse over the All-Star Break after several poor performances in relief. During the 2018 season, Sol√≠s appeared in a career-high 56 games for the Nationals, primarily as a situational left-handed pitcher against left-handed batters. He had difficulty against left-handed batters during the year; they had a .993 on-base plus slugging percentage in 88 match-ups against him, hitting five home runs, two doubles, and two triples. He allowed 28 runs in 39 innings pitched with 18 walks and 44 strikeouts and finished the season with a record of 1‚Äì2 and a career-worst 6.41 ERA. Sol√≠s was scheduled to reach non-tender free agency on November 30, 2018, but the Nationals avoided that by signing him to a one-year deal that day, partly because his success against left-handed batters prior to 2018 suggested that he might again succeed against them in the future. He made four appearances for the Nationals during spring training in 2019, but the Nationals concluded that he would not make the 2019 team and unconditionally released him on March 9, 2019. At the time of his release he had a career ERA of 4.51 with 136 strikeouts and 56 walks in innings pitched, a .701 OPS against right-handed hitters, and a .759 OPS against left-handed batters. =San Diego Padres= On March 11, 2019, Solis signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres.

It is found in the northwest Atlantic and the northeast Pacific Oceans. Description Gersemia rubiformis is a colonial coral that grows in the form of knobbly clumps. The colonies are erect and branch from one main stalk. The polyps are concentrated near the ends of the narrower terminal branches and are non-retractile in their calyces. The branches are not rigid but are stiffened by the presence of sclerites, and can sway gently in the current. The sclerites are red, some being irregular and shaped like miniature capstans. Gersemia rubiformis does not contain the symbiotic alga zooxanthella. Distribution Gersemia rubiformis is found in polar to temperate regions of the Arctic Ocean and the north west Atlantic Ocean from the coasts of Canada south to Cape Hatteras in North Carolina. A separate population is found in the Pacific Ocean off the coasts of British Columbia and south to California. It occurs on both sandy and muddy substrates, on rocks and on the hard parts of other benthic invertebrates such as shells. Ecology Many other marine invertebrates share the habitat of Gersemia rubiformis. Juvenile basket stars (Gorgonocephalus eucnemis) are often found clinging to the coral and hiding in the interstices. The white sea anemone Metridium senile often grows nearby and the rock scallop (Crassadoma gigantea) shares the same habitat in California.Sea strawberry, Gersemia rubiformis Cold Water Images. Retrieved 2012-01-25. In Puget Sound, juvenile basket stars (Gorgonocephalus eucnemis) have been found to be living, growing and feeding inside the pharynges of Gersemia rubiformis polyps, only becoming free-living when they have grown large enough to catch food for themselves.Gorgonocephalus eucnemis Muller and Troschel, 1842 Walla Walla University. Retrieved 2012-01-25. Research Researchers in British Columbia found that extracts of Gersemia rubiformis showed antimicrobial activity when tested in vitro. They identified three novel diterpenoids which they named gersemolide, rubifolide and epilophodione.

He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres, and in the KBO League for the NC Dinos. Early life Bethancourt was born and raised in Panama City, Panama where he began playing baseball at the age of five. As a third baseman, Bethancourt had a tendency to abandon his position in favor of wherever the ball was hit. His parents convinced him to move behind the plate, saying that if Bethancourt left his position as a catcher during a game, his team would lose, as the other team would find it easy to score. Career =Minor leagues= Bethancourt was signed as a non-drafted international free agent and began his minor league career at the age of 16 in 2008. He was named the seventh-most- promising catching prospect in baseball by MLB.com prior to the 2012 season. Bethancourt played for the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern League in 2012. He was named to the All-Star Futures Game. On August 9, 2012, Bethancourt broke his left hand when he was hit with a pitch. The Braves added him to their 40-man roster after the 2012 season. Carlos Correa (left) and Christian Bethancourt at the 2013 All-Star Futures Game Bethancourt again played for Mississippi in 2013 and made his second All Star Futures Game roster. Following the end of the minor league season, he was promoted and joined the Atlanta Braves on September 9, 2013. Bethancourt made his major league debut against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 29, 2013. He struck out in his only at bat. =Atlanta Braves= Atlanta Braves in 2014 In 2014, Bethancourt began the year with the Gwinnett Braves of the Class AAA International League, and made his third consecutive All Star Futures Game on June 24. He was promoted to the major leagues when Evan Gattis went on the disabled list on June 28. He recorded his first major league RBI on July 1, against Daisuke Matsuzaka. Bethancourt batted .240 with the Braves in 13 games, and was demoted to the minor leagues on July 21, when Gattis was activated from the disabled list. He was to be promoted back to the Braves on September 2. In spring training in 2015, the Braves said Bethancourt would have to be assessed before he would be given the position of primary catcher. On June 6, Bethancourt hit his first career home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, off of Vance Worley, to give the Braves a 5‚Äì4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bethancourt appeared in 29 games for the Braves in early 2015, batting .208/.231/.297 with a .528 OPS and six passed balls, before being sent to back down to AAA Gwinnett on June 15 after he made a series of defensive mistakes and failed to hit. At the time, according to ESPN Stats he was ranked 66th out of 82 qualifiers in catcher's ERA (4.50). He also was ranked third among National League catchers in most passed balls and tied for fourth in errors (3) while playing in only 29 games. He was recalled on August 24. On October 5, Bethancourt underwent knee surgery for a torn meniscus. =San Diego Padres= On December 10, 2015, Bethancourt was traded to the San Diego Padres for right hander Casey Kelly and Ricardo Rodriguez. After spring training ended in April 2016, Bethancourt was named the backup to starting catcher Derek Norris. Bethancourt made his first career pitching appearance on May 31, a blowout loss against the Seattle Mariners, recording two outs, two walks, and a hit batsmen. He took the mound again on June 14, against the Miami Marlins, picking up his first strikeout as a pitcher, while yielding one hit and one walk in one inning. At the end of the season, Bethancourt returned to his home country to play in the Panamanian Professional Baseball League, where he saw playing time as a pitcher and position player. On April 1, 2017, the Padres announced that Bethancourt would work primarily as a reliever, while also seeing duties as a catcher, outfielder, and pinch hitter. Bethancourt struggled in four relief appearances, and the Padres outrighted him off of their 40-man roster to the El Paso Chihuahuas of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, where he continued pitching. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. =Milwaukee Brewers= On January 8, 2018, Bethancourt signed a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. He was assigned to the team‚Äôs Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, for the 2018 season. On July 11, 2018, he played in the Triple-A All-Star Game. Bethancourt elected free agency on November 2, 2018. =NC Dinos= On December 12, 2018, Bethancourt signed a one-year, $1 million deal with the NC Dinos of the KBO League. He was waived on July 3, 2019. =Philadelphia Phillies= On January 7, 2020, Bethancourt signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.

It consists of the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan. It is recommended for use as a replacement for an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Potential side effects include angioedema, kidney problems, and low blood pressure. The combination is sometimes described as an \\"angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor\\" (ARNi). It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 2015. It was approved for medical use in Australia in 2016. Medical uses Sacubitril/valsartan can be used instead of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in people with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), alongside other standard therapies (e.g. beta- blockers) for heart failure. To investigate its use for heart failure in those with a preserved LVEF (HFpEF), Novartis funded the PARAGON-HF trial which was designed to investigate the use of sacubatril/valsartan in the treatment of HFpEF patients with a LVEF of 45% or more. Concluding in 2019, it failed to show significance for reducing hospitalisation related to heart failure or reducing death from cardiovascular causes, and therefore appearing to show limited benefit to those with HFpEF. A Cochrane systematic review of data from 37 trials investigating treatments for HFpEF suggested that evidence is also lacking to support the use of ACE Inhibitors, ARBs or ARNIs in patients with HFpEF at this time, and that the mainstay pharmacological therapy for HFpEF still remains the treatment of co-morbidities such as hypertension or other triggers for decompensation.Martin N, Manoharan K, Thomas J, Davies C, Lumbers RT. Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2018, Issue 6. Art. No.: CD012721. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012721.pub2. https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012721.pub2/epdf/full Patients who exhibit symptoms of NYHA Class II or III heart failure and are still symptomatic despite maximally tolerated dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB alone, may be considered for sacubitril/valsartan dual therapy to decrease the risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality. Mortality benefits have only been observed to date in those with LVEF less than 35%. Changing 100 people from an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist to sacubitril/valsartan for 2.3 years would prevent three deaths, five hospitalizations for heart failure, and eleven hospitalizations overall. Adverse effects Common adverse effects [>1%] include hyperkalaemia [high potassium levels in the blood, a known side effect of Valsartan], hypotension [low blood pressure, common in vasodilators and extracellular fluid volume reducers], a persistent dry cough and renal impairment [reduced kidney function]. Angioedema, a rare but more serious reaction, can occur in some patients [<1%] and involves swelling of the face and lips. Angioedema is more common in black patients. Sacubitril/Valsartan should not be taken within 36 hours of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor to reduce the risk of developing Angioedema. The side effect profile in trials of sacubitril/valsartan compared to valsartan alone or enalapril [an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor] is very similar, with the incidence of hypotension slightly higher in sacubitril/valsartan, the risk comparable for angioedema, and the chance of hyperkalaemia, renal impairment and cough slightly lower. Sacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated in pregnancy because it contains valsartan, a known risk for birth defects. Pharmacology Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). This receptor is found on both vascular smooth muscle cells, and on the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal gland which are responsible for aldosterone secretion. In the absence of AT1 blockade, angiotensin causes both direct vasoconstriction and adrenal aldosterone secretion, the aldosterone then acting on the distal tubular cells of the kidney to promote sodium reabsorption which expands extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. Blockade of (AT1) thus causes blood vessel dilation and reduction of ECF volume. Sacubitril is a prodrug that is activated to sacubitrilat (LBQ657) by de-ethylation via esterases. Sacubitrilat inhibits the enzyme neprilysin, a neutral endopeptidase that degrades vasoactive peptides, including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and adrenomedullin. Thus, sacubitril increases the levels of these peptides, causing blood vessel dilation and reduction of ECF volume via sodium excretion. Despite these actions, neprilysin inhibitors have been found to have limited efficacy in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure when taken on their own. This is attributed to a reduction in enzymatic breakdown of angiotensin II by the reduction of neprilysin activity, which results in an increase in systemic angiotensin II levels and the negation of the positive effects of this drug family in cardiovascular disease treatment. Combined treatment with a neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been shown to be effective in reducing angiotensin II levels, and demonstrated superiority in lowering blood pressure compared to ACE inhibition alone. However, due to an increase in bradykinins from the inhibition of both ACE and neprilysin, there was a threefold increase in relative risk of angioedema compared with ACE inhibition alone following this combination treatment. The combination of a neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker instead of the ACE inhibitor has been shown to have a comparable risk of angioedema, whilst also demonstrating superiority in treating moderate-severe heart failure to ACE inhibitor treatment. Neprilysin also has a role in clearing the protein amyloid beta from the cerebrospinal fluid, and its inhibition by sacubitril has shown increased levels of AB1-38 in healthy subjects (Entresto 194/206 for two weeks). Amyloid beta is considered to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, and there exist concerns that sacubitril may promote the development of Alzheimer's disease. Chemistry Sacubitril/valsartan is co-crystallized sacubitril and valsartan, in a one-to-one molar ratio. One sacubitril/valsartan complex consists of six sacubitril anions, six valsartan anions, 18 sodium cations, and 15 molecules of water, resulting in the molecular formula C288H330N36Na18O48¬∑15H2O and a molecular mass of 5748.03 g/mol. The substance is a white powder consisting of thin hexagonal plates. It is stable in solid form as well as in aqueous (water) solution with a pH of 5 to 7, and has a melting point of about . History During its development by Novartis, Entresto was known as LCZ696. It was approved under the FDA's priority review process on 7 July 2015. It was also approved in Europe in 2015. Society and culture =Trial design= There was controversy over the PARADIGM-HF trial‚Äîthe Phase III trial on the basis of which the drug was approved by the FDA. For example, both Richard Lehman, a physician who writes a weekly review of key medical articles for the BMJ Blog and a December 2015, report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) found that the risk‚Äìbenefit ratio was not adequately determined because the design of the clinical trial was too artificial and did not reflect people with heart failure that doctors usually encounter.Richard Lehman's journal review‚Äî8 September 2014. NEJM 4 Sep 2014. Vol 371. The BMJ, 8 September 2014. In 2019, the PIONEER-HF and PARAGON- HF trials studied the effect of sacubitril/valsartan in 800 patients recently hospitalised with severe heart failure and 4800 patients with less severe symptoms of heart failure respectively. The medication consistently demonstrated similar levels of safety, with higher rates of very low blood pressure, compared to current treatments across all three trials in a variety of patients, however it has only shown effectiveness in those with more advanced heart failure. In December 2015, Steven Nissen and other thought leaders in cardiology said that the approval of sacubitril/valsartan had the greatest impact on clinical practice in cardiology in 2015, and Nissen called the drug \\"a truly a breakthrough approach.\\"Roger Sergel for Medpage Today. 5 Game-Changers in Cardiology in 2015: Entresto One 2015 review stated that sacubitril/valsartan represents \\"an advancement in the chronic treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction\\" but that widespread clinical success with the drug will require taking care to use it in appropriate patients, specifically those with characteristics similar to those in the clinical trial population. Another 2015 review called the reductions in mortality and hospitalization conferred by sacubitril/valsartan \\"striking\\", but noted that its effects in heart failure people with hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and the elderly needed to be evaluated further. =Economics= The wholesale cost to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is approximately per person per year as of 2017. The wholesale cost in the United States is per year . Similar class generic drugs without sacubitril, such as valsartan alone, cost approximately a year. One industry- funded analysis found a cost of per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Research The PARADIGM-HF trial (in which Milton Packer was one of the principal investigators) compared treatment with sacubitril/valsartan to treatment with enalapril. People with heart failure and reduced LVEF (10,513) were sequentially treated on a short-term basis with enalapril and then with sacubitril/valsartan. Those that were able to tolerate both regimens (8442, 80%) were randomly assigned to long-term treatment with either enalapril or sacubitril/valsartan. Participants were mainly white (66%), male (78%), middle aged (median 63.8 +/- 11 years) with NYHA stage II (71.6%) or stage III (23.1%) heart failure. The trial was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis revealed a reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure in the sacubitril/valsartan group relative to those treated with enalapril. Taken individually, the reductions in cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations retained statistical significance. Relative to enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan provided reductions in * the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (incidence 21.8% vs 26.5%) * cardiovascular death (incidence 13.3% vs 16.5%) * first hospitalization for worsening heart failure (incidence 12.8% vs 15.6%), and * all-cause mortality (incidence 17.0% vs 19.8%) Limitations of the trial include scarce experience with initiation of therapy in hospitalized patients and in those with NYHA heart failure class IV symptoms. Additionally the trial compared a maximal dose of valsartan (plus sacubitril) with a sub-maximal dose of enalapril, and was thus not directly comparable with current gold-standard use of ACE inhibitors in heart failure, diminishing the validity of the trial results.

Cake crumbs are mixed with icing or chocolate, and formed into small spheres or cubes in the same way as cake balls, before being given a coating of icing, chocolate or other decorations and attached to lollipop sticks. Cake pops can be a way of using up leftover cake or cake crumbs. The cake pop increased in popularity between 2009 and 2011.  Preparation  A video demonstration of the making of cake pops with a melted chocolate coating. Cake pops use many of the ingredients used in baking a traditional cake and can be made from cakes of any flavor. Many recipes found online use a cake mix instead of a cake batter from scratch. While more convenient, it doesn't necessarily deliver the same result. The from scratch cake recipes yield cake that tends to be denser than store-bought mixes, performing better especially after mixed with homemade frosting. The denser cake is stiffer, making it easier to shape the balls and attach the sticks. Store bought mix yields a lighter cake that doesn't harden as much, and the sticks tend to slip out after attached. Once the cake has been baked, or when leftovers from an existing cake have been collected, it is crumbled into pieces. These crumbs are mixed into a bowl of frosting and the resulting mixture is shaped into balls, cubes or other shapes. Each ball is attached to a lollipop stick dipped in melted chocolate, and put in the fridge to chill. Once the mixture solidifies, it is dipped in melted chocolate to form a hard shell, and decorated with sprinkles or decorative sugars. The cake balls can be frozen to speed the solidification process. Most of the time making a cake pop is spent on shaping the cake into a desirable form and decorating it. Simple shapes such as spheres can be molded by hands, but complex shapes require tools. Silicone molding pan and cookie cutters are popular tools used in shaping cake pops.

Biography As with most monks of the Tang Dynasty, there are conflicting lines of evidence concerning Yaoshan's life. The earliest biographical information comes from Tang Shen, who wrote Yaoshan's epitaph in 834, seven years after his death. While he is traditionally regarded as a student of Shitou Xiqian, Tang Shen's inscription mentions that he stayed with Mazu Daoyi for nearly twenty years. It also mentions Shitou as his teacher, however. Some scholars consider the epitaph to be a later forgery, although many elements of it agree with other sources. A story dating to the middle of the eleventh century relates an encounter between Yaoshan and Shitou in which Yaoshan failed to awaken, but a later visit to Mazu results in his enlightenment. This is almost certainly a fanciful jibe at Shitou and praise for Mazu, however. Nonthinking A story involving Yaoshan is frequently referenced in the writing of D≈çgen, the founder of the S≈çt≈ç school in Japan. The story is as follows: According to Carl Bielefeldt, a religious studies professor at Stanford University, this passage encapsulates the essence of D≈çgen's teaching on zazen. Because of this, it is referenced frequently in his works, such as in the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, Eihei K≈çroku, and most prominently his early work the Fukan zazengi.

The area includes parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola (Cabinda Province), the Republic of the Congo and Gabon. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mayombe is part of the north-western province of Kongo Central on the right bank of the River Congo, and contains the cities and towns of Lukula, Seke Banza, Kangu and Tshela. Physical geography Umbrella tree (Musanga cecropioides) in the Mayombe forest Mayumbe is located in the west of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It lies on the right bank of the Congo River (the world's second largest) just before it empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Banana. It extends north from Boma into the Angolan enclave of Cabinda to the west and extends north to the Republic of Congo and Gabon. Mayumbe is watered by many rivers with swift currents in its hilly and mountainous regions. The three largest are the Shiloango River and two of its main tributaries, the Lukula River and the Lubuzi River. The main peaks are: *Mount Foungouti, 930 m *Mount Bamba, 810 m *Kinoumbou Mountains, 784 m *Ngouedi Mountains, 780 m *Kanga Mountains, 764 m *Mount Bombo, 751 m *Pic Kiama, 747 m Climate and ecology Mayumbe is south of the equator in the equatorial zone with oceanic influence and has two main seasons. The long dry season from June to September in the Mayumbe is not as intense as in the rest of the Lower Congo because of the altitude and the influence of the forest. Temperatures range from 17 to 22, but can drop to 8 ¬∞ at night. Nights can be quite cool. The long rainy season lasts from October to May, with temperatures of 28-33¬∞. The climate is hot and humid, especially during the rainy season when the humidity is near to 100%. This feeling of constant humidity is further increased by the condensation of the vapors of the trade winds that cool the cliffs of the Coastal Range. Flora vary from dense forest to savannah dotted with forest trees. The forests of Mayumbe are old. Some of the trees are valuable, especially the Limba. Palm trees are plentiful in the Elais Mayumbe and are found in forests and in the savanna. They form one of the great resources of this region for its inhabitants. The area's forests were estimated in 1950 to cover . More recently they have declined to , of which Limba account for over 40%. People Among the ethnic groups that inhabit this region the Yombe, a subset of the Kongo people, are the most numerous. Railway The Mayumbe railway, August 1930 The Mayombe Railway linked Boma to Tshela, with a planned extension to the Republic of Congo. It was dismantled under President Mobutu Sese Seko and the tracks were reused near Gbadolite. The Mayombe in Congo is covered by the Congo-Ocean Railway. People from Mayombe Mayombe is famous in Senegal because it is an important stage in the exile of the founder of mouridism, Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba, during the French colonial administration. He remained there five years.

Designed by sculptor Randolph Rogers, it consists of a tapering granite Corinthian column crowned by a bronze goddess of Victory, a three-tiered granite pedestal adorned with bronze plaques, buttresses surmounted by four bronze statues representing branches of the military - Artillery, Cavalry, Infantry, Navy - with the whole resting upon a rough granite base flanked by four buried cannons barrels. The pedestal's top tier is adorned with four relief plaques: the City of Worcester seal, the Massachusetts state seal, the United States seal, and a pair of crossed swords encircled by a laurel wreath. The middle tier features relief busts of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew, a battle scene of a dying soldier supported by a comrade, and the monument's dedication plaque. The bottom tier features four inscription plaques listing the names of the 398 Worcester soldiers who died in the war. In 1871, the Soldiers' Monument Committee commissioned Rogers to design the memorial. The City of Worcester appropriated $35,000, and an addition $15,000 was raised by subscription. The monument was dedicated on July 15, 1874. When built, the monument was approximately tall, and the base was approximately square. The ground level was raised in 1969, burying the rough-granite base, so the monument is now approximately shorter. Dedication Plaque: File:CivilWarMemorialWorcester.JPGSoldiers' Monument in 2009.

He would later head up both the newly created Atlanta Housing Authority and the Chamber of Commerce.Biographical note, \\"Palmer, Charles F.\\", Emory Library EmoryFindingAid Biography =Early career in Atlanta= Palmer began his real estate and housing career by establishing the C.F. Palmer Company, a realty firm, in Santa Barbara, California. He met Judge John S. Candler, brother to Coca-Cola owner Asa Griggs Candler, who in 1920 persuaded Palmer to move to Atlanta to exploit the commercial investment opportunities there. Palmer opened a real estate firm there, Palmer. Inc., specializing in downtown office properties. As of 1930 Palmer was president of the National Association of Building Owners and Managers, shuttling back and forth between Atlanta and Washington, D.C. =Public housing in Atlanta= =Inspiration= In the first 100 days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's new administration in 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act was passed, which created the federal Public Works Administration (PWA). Of the PWA's more than $3 billion budget, $100 million was targeted towards slum clearance and low- cost housing. At that time, already for half a century in Europe, philanthropists, industrialists, and governments had been building homes and communities aimed at improving the health and welfare of low and middle income workers. The United States remained the only developed Western country without a national legislative and financial commitment to housing.Carol A. Flores, US public housing in the 1930s: The first projects in Atlanta, Georgia] Palmer wrote in his autobiographical book, Adventures of a Slum Fighter that he had visited London and been told that slum clearance was helping to increase and stabilize real estate values there. Palmer stated repeatedly in his book that he was a Republican and that his primary motivation was benefit to his real estate investments, although slum clearance might well \\"benefit humanity...as well\\".Charles Forrest Palmer, Adventures of a Slum Fighter =Organization of the Techwood project= Palmer selected Tech Flats as the first slum to clear and rebuild. Tech Flats was a slum housing both white and black families, and it was also known as Tanyard Bottom, as Tanyard Creek flowed through it. Palmer states that he selected Tech Flats was because his commute downtown from his Brookwood Hills home took him along the edge of it every day. He set up a Board of Trustees including Clark Howell, publisher of the Atlanta Constitution, builder Thorne Flagler, architect Flip Surge, Georgia Tech president Marion L. Brittain, mayor James Key, president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and Herbert Choate, and general manager of the Hearst paper the Atlanta Georgian and Sunday American Herbert Porter, and J. Sid Tiller \\"from labor\\". Palmer added a sister project, University Homes, which would be built to house blacks (Techwood was for whites only) and would replace the black Beaver Slide slum. For that project Palmer worked together with Atlanta University president John Hope, O.I. Freeman, civil engineer, and W.J. Sayward, architect. Palmer spent several years lobbying Washington for funds to start the project and countering local business interests opposed to the project. In his book, Palmer wrote that delivery of a letter from Howell in person to President Roosevelt did the trick to finally secure funding. While the two projects were under construction, Palmer returned to Europe in both 1934 and 1936 to research public housing programs there. He used materials and knowledge gathered there to lobby for permanent housing legislation in the United States. President Roosevelt dedicated Techwood Homes in person in late 1935 and the first families moved in during 1936. Palmer's private-sector but Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-supported Oak Knoll development was noted in a 1937 meeting by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr.. Roosevelt was delighted that private enterprise could provide good homes at moderate rentals. The conversation about Oak Knoll drew the conclusion that private projects were in fact strengthened by public housing projects serving as a \\"pace setter\\", and helped support arguments for a more proactive nationwide public housing policy. The house at 1099 Oak Knoll Drive was featured in a 1938 issue of Life magazine, as it was a Life \\"model house\\"; the model kits were available for purchase from retailers around the country.Life magazine, December 26, 1938 In 1938, Palmer served as President of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, and also organized the new Atlanta Housing Authority, of which he served as the first Chairman, until 1940. =Later career= In 1940 President Roosevelt appointed him as Defense Housing Coordinator (United States Office for Emergency Management, Division of Defense Housing Coordination), a position that he held through 1941. In 1942, he directed the Special Housing Mission to the U.K., researching British plans for post-war urban and economic recovery. In subsequent years he served in many roles advising on housing improvement, lecturing, and writing. Besides his book, Palmer published many articles and speeches on building management, public housing, and urban renewal. References  External Links  * Stuart A.

The church building itself was built in 1888. On October 28, 1983, the complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance. St. Joseph's Parish was organized in 1842, the first Roman Catholic church in Waukesha. Solomon Juneau donated the first church building, which was a log cabin on the site of the current complex. In 1844 the parish built a stone church building, With which has since served as a parish hall, school, and medical clinic. This 1844 building has been remodeled enough that it is not part of the NRHP nomination. In 1888 the parish began building a larger church building. Adolphus Druiding of Chicago designed it in High Victorian Gothic style, with its emphasis on the vertical. The exterior is rock-faced, randomly-coursed limestone, with multiple rose windows, lancet windows, and multiple gables and spires. Each gable is topped with a cross. The layout is asymmetric, with a large tower on one side of the main entrance, rising to a tall steeple topped with a cross. The Brown House is the other part of the complex that is part of the NRHP nomination. It was built around 1878, a two-story brick house with Greek Revival massing and Italianate details. It was originally the home of Martin Brown, a harness maker. The church later used the house as a convent. Both the church building and the Brown house were nominated to the NRHP for their architectural significance. They are some of the best surviving examples of their styles in Waukesha.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. This willow is quite variable in appearance, depending on environmental conditions. It grows to in dense clumps. The branches are yellowish or reddish-brown, mottled with green. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval and are up to long. They have smooth, wavy, or toothed edges. The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive parts occurring on separate plants. The flowers are often pollinated by bees. The seeds are viable for a short time, but germinate immediately on landing on an appropriate moist substrate. This plant is common on the riverbanks of Arctic Alaska and Yukon. It forms thickets on floodplains where recent deposits of soil have been washed down by floodwaters. In western Colorado, it may be a dominant or codominant species in riparian zones. It often forms thickets along waterways. This plant is an important food source for many types of animals, such as moose and ptarmigan. Honey bees use the pollen and nectar.

Alongside the law faculties in Copenhagen, Lund and Uppsala, it is one of Scandinavia's leading institutions of legal education and research.Bertnes, P√•l A. (1991). Sources to legal information in Norway. Det juridiske bibliotekfond. . Prior to 1811, the University of Copenhagen was the only university of Denmark- Norway, and the curriculum of the new law faculty in Christiania (renamed Oslo in 1925) was based on that of the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Law and long retained strong similarities, even after the dissolution of the Dano- Norwegian union in 1814. As the only faculty of law in Norway until 1980, it traditionally educated all lawyers of Norway and remains the country's most important law faculty, educating around 75% of all new legal candidates in Norway. Its law programme is one of the most competitive programmes to get into at any Norwegian university, with an acceptance rate of 12%. The faculty offers education and conducts research in both law and in related areas such as criminology and sociology of law, and historically also in economics (its former Dean, Ragnar Frisch, was awarded the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences). The faculty occupies the old university campus in the centre of Oslo, near the National Theatre, the Royal Palace, and the Parliament, constructed 1841‚Äì1851 by Christian Heinrich Grosch with the assistance of world-famous Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel in Schinkel's neoclassical style, with strong similarities to Schinkel's famous museums on the Museum Island in Berlin. The old campus includes three main buildings, called Domus Academica, Domus Media and Domus Bibliotheca, centered on the University Square and facing Karl Johans gate. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the atrium of the central building of the old campus, Domus Media, 1947‚Äì1989, and since 2003, the Abel Prize is also awarded in this building. The Parliament of Norway convened in the Old Ceremonial Hall in Domus Academica 1854‚Äì1866. The faculty publishes several academic journals, including the English-language journal Oslo Law Review.Tar publiseringsmakta tilbake, Uniforum History The University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479. As there was no university in Norway itself, the University of Copenhagen served both Denmark and Norway during the countries' personal union, and the University of Copenhagen had both Norwegian students and teachers. With the rise of absolute monarchy and a more professional civil service, legal education became of central importance by the early 18th century. During the Napoleonic Wars, and after years of discussion, The Royal Frederick University in Norway was established in 1811 and named in honour of Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway, and the Faculty of Law was one of the four original faculties, ranking second after the Faculty of Theology and before the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Arts. In 1816, its first lecturers were appointed by the government: Lorents Lange (born 1781) was appointed Professor of Jurisprudence, and Henrik Lauritz Nicolai Steenbuch (born 1774) was appointed Lecturer in Jurisprudence. As a sovereign kingdom, Norway always had its own laws, but in 1687, Norway received its Norwegian Code, which was nearly identical to the Danish Code, and parts of which remain in effect until this day. Norway and Denmark hence shared a common legal tradition and in fact many of the same laws. The curriculum of the Faculty of Law in Christiania was hence to a large degree a direct continuation of the curriculum and traditions of the University of Copenhagen. Similarities exist until this day, although they have gradually been weakened. The field of economics as an academic discipline in Norway evolved at the Faculty of Law. In 1840, a chair in \\"Jurisprudence, Economics, and Statistics\\" was created by the King; it was first held by Anton Martin Schweigaard. Programmes and degrees =Principal law programme= The most important programme of the Faculty of Law is the 5-year legal education leading to a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree, known in Norwegian as master i rettsvitenskap (literally, \\"master of jurisprudence\\"), which is a protected title under Norwegian law. The programme replaced (2004‚Äì2007) the former six-year programme leading to a Candidate of Law (cand.jur.) degree, which was created in 1736 at the University of Copenhagen and retained at the Royal Frederick University from 1811 (the degree is still awarded in Copenhagen). The Master or Laws or the former Candidate of Law are the only degrees qualifying for legal work in Norway. The graduates have a monopoly on a number of occupations, such as advocate (barrister), judge and, traditionally, all the high ranks of the Norwegian Police Service and a number of senior civil servant positions. Norway has a united legal profession and all persons working in legal occupations have the same education. Alongside the programme in medicine, the programme in law in Oslo is one of the most competitive to get into at any Norwegian university with an acceptance rate of 12%. Although students do not receive a formal degree before they have completed the five-year programme, the first four years correspond to an American J.D. degree. In the fifth year, students usually write a thesis corresponding to one semester and take advanced courses of their choice also corresponding to one semester. Alternatively, they may choose to write a longer thesis, corresponding to a full year. Parts of the fifth year, or even the full year, may also be taken abroad. The fifth year leads to the Master of Laws degree. =Other degrees= From 1840 to 1966, the field of economics was part of the Faculty of Law, and most of the professors of economics until the mid 20th century had a background in law. Prior to 1966, the Faculty of Law conferred the degree cand.oecon., created in 1905, which was originally a 2-year supplementary degree in economics intended for those already holding a cand.jur. degree, and which in 1934 evolved into an independent five-year degree in economics. The Faculty of Law also offers degrees at all levels in criminology and a master's degree in sociology of law. In recent years, a number of specialized master's degree programmes in law, so-called LL.M. degrees, have been established. The Faculty of Law offers 1,5-year master's degrees in international public law, international criminal and humanitarian law, international economic law, international environmental and energy law and human rights. These degrees are intended for those already holding a law degree, whether foreign or Norwegian. They do not qualify for legal work in Norway, however, and very few Norwegian students obtain such degrees, as the basic legal education in Norway already leads to a degree at the LL.M. level. These programmes are hence mostly attracting foreign students. =Doctoral, licentiate and PhD degrees= The former doctorate in law, doctor juris (dr. jur.), created with the establishment of the University of Copenhagen in 1479 and retained by The Royal Frederick University from 1811, was gradually replaced (2004‚Äì2008) by the new degree philosophiae doctor (ph.d.), created in 2003. The faculty also confers the doctoral degree doctor philosophiae (dr.philos.), created in 1824, traditionally to doctoral candidates who are not legal professionals (for example to those with degrees in humanities or social sciences) or to scholars with a background in law who write a dissertation in a different field than law, and today to doctoral candidates who are not enrolled in the structured doctoral programme, but hand in their dissertation following independent research only (as was the case also for the dr.jur. degree until the 1990s). Traditionally, a doctoral degree was not a prerequisite for employment as a researcher, and was usually obtained after many years of research (ten or more), often by researchers at the associate professor level. The Faculty of Law confers doctorates in law and in other relevant disciplines such as criminology, sociology of law, philosophy of law, and formerly in economics. Prior to 1845, the licentiate degree also existed at The Royal Frederick University, as a degree below the doctorate but above the professional degrees. The licentiate degree was reintroduced in 1955 at the Faculty of Law (lic.jur.) and was awarded until 2003. It corresponds to a PhD degree. Prior to the Bologna Process, the degree system at the University of Oslo Faculty of Law mirrored that of the University of Copenhagen, and Denmark in general. In Denmark, both the dr.jur. degree and the ph.d. degree exist today. The ph.d. degree, conferred following a 3-year programme by those already holding a (5-year) cand.jur. degree, is considered equivalent to and a direct continuation of the licentiate degree, whereas the dr.jur. degree is considered a doctorate in the proper sense, also referred to as a higher doctorate. Often the dr.jur. degree is obtained by those already holding a cand.jur. and a ph.d. degree. Research The faculty's two departments of Sociology of Law and Criminology, which are now merged to form a single department, are famous internationally for their contributions to the fields of sociology of law and criminology since the 1950s. Eminent academics in this field include Nils Christie, Vilhelm Aubert, and Thomas Mathiesen. Ragnar Frisch, who was professor of economics and statistics at the Faculty of Law from 1931 and also served as its dean, founded the discipline of econometrics and coined the terms macroeconomics/microeconomics, and was awarded the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969. The faculty is also recognized internationally for its research on maritime law, petroleum and energy law, human rights, feminist jurisprudence, and the emerging field of information/communication technology law. The Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law is the second-oldest institution in the world in this field. Feminist jurisprudence became a recognised discipline at the faculty in 1975, and the faculty established a department of feminist jurisprudence, headed by Tove Stang Dahl, in 1978. A number of academic journals are published by or edited at the Faculty of Law, including the Nordic Journal of Human Rights and Tidsskrift for Rettsvitenskap (Scandinavia's leading law journal, established in 1888). Buildings The faculty's main, neoclassicist buildings, centered on the University Square and facing Karl Johans gate, constructed by Christian Heinrich Grosch and Karl Friedrich Schinkel 1841‚Äì1851, are *Domus Bibliotheca (to the left, seen from Karl Johans gate), which includes the Law Library, IT rooms, lecture halls and offices for professors *Domus Media (in the centre), which includes reading rooms, lecture halls, offices for professors, and in the centre, the Atrium *Domus Academica (to the right, seen from Karl Johans gate), which includes the Old Ceremonial Hall, lecture halls, offices for the administration, and IT rooms These buildings are strongly influenced by Schinkel's monumental buildings in Berlin, in particular the Museumsinsel. The impressive stair hall of Domus Media is closely inspired by the stair hall of Altes Museum in Berlin (completed in 1830). The Atrium of Domus Media was built as an extension of Domus Media on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the university in 1911. It was decorated by Edvard Munch 1909‚Äì16. In front of Domus Media, statues of Peter Andreas Munch and Anton Martin Schweigaard are displayed. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the Atrium of Domus Media 1947‚Äì1989. Among those who received the prize in Domus Media are Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa, Desmond Tutu, and the 14th Dalai Lama. Before 1947, the prize was awarded in the Norwegian Nobel Institute, and since 1990, it has been awarded in Oslo City Hall two minutes walk from the Faculty of Law. Since 2003, the Abel Prize has been awarded in the Atrium. The Atrium is also used for concerts and cultural events, and for the Faculty of Law's own events. The Parliament of Norway convened in the Old Ceremonial Hall of Domus Academica from 1854 to 1866, when the Parliament of Norway Building was completed. In addition to the three main buildings of the old campus, the faculty uses several other newer buildings in the immediate vicinity of the old campus in central Oslo. The Faculty of Law has occupied the old campus continuously since 1851. Until the mid-1980s, the Faculty of Law shared the old campus with the Faculty of Medicine, which was also partially based at the university hospitals in the Oslo area. The Faculty of Medicine has since completely relocated to the university hospitals (mainly Rikshospitalet), leaving the Faculty of Law as the only faculty occupying the old campus. The Atrium in Domus Media and the Old Ceremonial Hall in Domus Academica are still used for ceremonial purposes by other parts of the university. The faculties of theology, humanities and mathematics-natural sciences relocated to Blindern in the suburban West End in the 1930s, where the newer faculties of social sciences and education are also found. Departments For the first one and a half century of its existence, the Faculty of Law was not organised into departments, but rather centered on each chair. From the 1950s, a number of departments have been established. All academics are now affiliated with one of the departments. The establishment of the departments was supported by generous grants from shipping magnate (and lawyer) Anders Jahre. For the first decades, the departments had a fairly weak position organisationally. The boundaries between departments in the three traditional higher faculties, i.e. the faculties of theology, law and medicine, are significantly weaker than in the other faculties, and the faculty identity stronger, due to the fact that most employees share the same profession. Historically, all Professors of Law at the Faculty of Law were expected to teach all areas of law. Law students (i.e. students enrolled in the Master of Laws programme) are not affiliated with any specific department, only with the faculty. Students of criminology, sociology of law or some specialized fields are affiliated with a department, however. =Department of Criminology and Sociology of Law= The Department of Criminology and Sociology of Law is the largest academic institution in the fields of criminology and sociology of law in the Nordic countries. The department was established in 2000 by the merger of the Department of Criminology (established in 1954 as the Department of Criminology and Criminal Law) and the Department of Sociology of Law (established in 1961). Criminology and criminal law split in the early 1990s, when criminal law became part of the Department of Public and International Law. =Department of Public and International Law= The Department of Public and International Law was established in 1957. It covers a number of fields in public and international law, including constitutional law, administrative law, public international law, criminal law and criminal procedure, civil procedure, environmental law, labour law, legal history, legal theory, refugee and asylum law, social law, tax law and women's law. =Department of Private Law= The Department of Private Law was established in 1955. =Scandinavian Institute of Maritime Law= The Scandinavian Institute of Maritime Law was established in 1955, as the Department of Maritime Law. It includes the Department of Maritime Law and the Department of Petroleum and Energy Law. =Norwegian Centre for Human Rights= The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights has the status of national human rights institution in Norway, and is internationally recognised as a leading research institution in the field of human rights. The centre is cross-disciplinary, and its staff includes lawyers, social scientists, and philosophers. The centre was established in 1987, and was originally an independent research institution that arose from a cooperation between the University of Oslo and the Peace Research Institute Oslo. It was completely integrated into the University of Oslo Faculty of Law in 2003. =Centre of European Law= The Centre of European Law is a research centre focusing on European Union law and EEA law. It was established in 1989. =Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law= The Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law is the second oldest institution in this field in the world. It includes the Section for eGovernment Studies. =Former departments= The faculty formerly had a Department of Economics, which became part of the new Faculty of Social Sciences in 1966. =Cooperation= The Faculty of Law cooperates with other entities of the University of Oslo which are not formally part of the Faculty of Law, for example the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies. Deans Fredrik Stang, Dean 1921‚Äì1927. He simultaneously held the position of Rector of The Royal Frederick University and Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Historically, the rector of the university, elected among all the professors, was ex officio also dean of his own faculty. Otherwise the dean was elected among the professors at the faculty. Readers became eligible to vote in 1939 and other academics and students in 1955. From 1975, even the administrative staff were granted the right to vote. *Torkel Halvorsen Aschehoug ca. 1879 *Frederik Peter Brandt *Marcus Pl√∏en Ingstad *Oskar J√¶ger 1909‚Äì1911 *Absalon Taranger *Bredo Henrik von Munthe af Morgenstierne 1912‚Äì1918 (ex officio) *Fredrik Stang 1921‚Äì1927 (ex officio) *Ingvar Wedervang 1933‚Äì1935 *Frede Castberg ca. 1940 *Theodor Grundt 1940 *Ragnar Frisch 1942‚Äì1943 *Carl Jacob Arnholm 1945‚Äì1951 *Johannes Anden√¶s 1959‚Äì1960 *Johan Einarsen ‚Äì1963 *Sjur Br√¶khus 1963‚Äì1967 *Johannes Anden√¶s 1968‚Äì1969 *Anders Bratholm 1974‚Äì1976 *Carsten Smith 1977‚Äì1979 *Peter L√∏drup 1980‚Äì1985 *Erling Selvig 1989‚Äì1994 *Frederik Zimmer 1995‚Äì2000 *Knut Kaasen 2001‚Äì2003 *Jon T.

Jon Bing, Professor of Law at the Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law, and who is also a science fiction writer, is internationally recognised as a pioneer of information/communication technology law Prior to 1990, all professors (i.e. full professors, the only ones who are called \\"professors\\" in Norway) were appointed by the King-in- Council to their chairs, but today, new Professors are appointed directly by the Faculty of Law. The positions below that of professor are called dosent (reader, abolished in 1985), f√∏rsteamanuensis (associate professor), and universitetslektor or amanuensis (lecturer or assistant professor). Temporary, qualifying positions are postdoktor (senior research fellow) and stipendiat (a research fellow enrolled in a doctoral programme). A small number of employees hold the title forsker (researcher) and usually have no teaching obligations; their formal qualifications may vary from the assistant professor level to the full professor level. Full professors with part-time positions (20% or less) are called professor II, but otherwise hold the same status as other professors; usually such professors hold a chair or main position at a different university or research institution.

Built like a small Tudor castle, it is situated about back from the clifftops of the Bristol Channel between Llantwit Major and St Donats. The main house was demolished after a fire in 1948,http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/18555/details/dimlands-dimland-castle but its lodge, in a similar castellated style, survives and became a Grade II listed building on 9 October 1982. History The site was previously occupied by the fortress of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, lord of Glamorgan and the last ruler of the Welsh kingdom of Morgannwg; its fields are still known as Caer Wrgan (\\"Wrganstown\\"). The property was held by the Nicholl family since the time of King Henry VII. Dimlands was built by Rev. Robert Nicholl Carne at the end of the 18th century upon land left him by his father, Whitlock Nicholl, of The Ham, High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1746. Upon Robert's death in 1849, his younger son, John Whitlock Nicholl Carne of the University of Oxford, inherited Dimlands, and the 1850 improvements are attributed to him Dimlands was leased to the architect Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt (1820‚Äì1877) in 1875, he being the husband of Mary Nicholl of The Ham, a great niece of Robert. Wyatt died at Dimlands two years later. It is possible that John involved Wyatt (designer of The Ham mansion) in the Dimlands' 1850 renovation. In the early 20th century, from 1900 to 1921, the Crawshays were Dimlands' tenants; Tudor Crawshay was Deputy Lieutenant of Glamorgan, and vicar‚Äôs warden of St Illtyd's Church, Llantwit Major. Tudor Crawshay's son Owen was a tenant of the nearby Tresilian House at Tresilian Bay. The main house was destroyed by fire in 1948. Architecture and fittings Dimlands, c.1850 ;Exterior The dwelling was of castellated Tudor architecture with blue lias limestone exterior, and Coombedown stone windows and cornices. The south facing main front was more than in length. The western coast of Cornwall and Lundy Island were visible from the south turrets. ;Interior The interior was described in 1853 as follows: \\"The carved chimney in the dining room is made of Caen stone; the old Carne motto of \\"+FY ;+NGOBAITH+SY DD+YN. + NUW.+.\\" (My hope is in God) is inscribed on its chief panel. Other features are Mintons tile flooring, the large Tudor style staircase, two sitting rooms, and the library, a newer addition. The drawing room is remarkable for the peculiar shape of its chimney piece; it has features similar to those found in some church arches. It is constructed of Caen stone, and has a label over it, ending in two supporters, with the monogram I:N:C. On this label is the ancient motto \\"-4-HEB.-fDHYW.+HEB.-TDHYM.+DUW+A+DIGON+\\". There are several large oil paintings of St. Donat's Castle, Lanrihangle, Llantwit Major, and other residences connected with this family. A later built library features a large fireplace, which is fitted with a dog grate and decorated with white glazed bricks. There are two other sitting rooms, which contain some paintings, including one of Miss Elinor Carne (afterwards Mrs. Thomas Markham) by Sir Thomas Lawrence, done at Bath, when she was only fourteen, and the painter sixteen years of age.\\" Grounds The Dimlands stables were built on a small scale. Burke, in 1853, described them as consisting of sharp, pointed gables, which are finished off at the top with the Carne crest, cut in freestone, incorporating a split pelican issuing out of a ducal coronet. On the southern front of the stables, there is an odd carved stone containing the Carne arms, the date of the original grant in A.D. 1336, and the confirmation in A.D. 1842, together with an account of the assumption of the Carne surname and estates through marriage by the Rev. Robert Nicholl. References This article incorporates public domain text from John Bernard Burke's A visitation of the seats and arms of the noblemen and gentlemen of Great Britain (1853).

The son of Jack Henry Whatford and Emily Rose Whatford, he was born at Eastbourne, Sussex, and educated at Harrow School. By 1900, Whatford was serving in the British Army as a Second Lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment. He was still serving in the South Staffordshire Regiment as a 2nd Lieutenant in February 1902, when he transferred to the Indian Staff Corps in the British Indian Army. The following year he was serving in the 6 Madras Infantry, where he was promoted to lieutenant in that year. In 1904, Whatford made his first-class debut in cricket for Sussex against Somerset at the Recreation Ground, Bath, in the 1904 County Championship, though in a match affected by the elements, Whatford wasn't required to bat. He made a second first-class appearance in that same season against Gloucestershire at the Ashley Down Ground, Bristol. Whatford scored 8 runs in Sussex's first-innings, before he was dismissed by Henry Huggins, while in their second-innings he was run out for 13 runs. By 1909, he was serving in the British Raj with the 66th Punjabis. It was in this year that he was promoted to the rank of Captain. His service continued in to World War I, during which he was killed in action in the Mesopotamian campaign at the Battle of Ctesiphon on 22 November 1915. Prior to his death he was due to be promoted to the rank of Major. No known grave exists for Whatford, though his name is commemorated on The Basra Memorial.

History This work was painted at the start of Rossetti's affair with Jane Morris, who modelled for the picture. As he was to do with Beata Beatrix (1870), Rossetti chose a tale by Dante Aligheri (from Purgatorio) to illustrate his love for his model. The story tells of a woman whose husband imprisoned and later poisoned her:Cf. Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy, \\"Purgatorio\\", Canto V, vv.130‚Äì136 \\"Pia de' Tolomei\\". Rossetti wanted the world to believe the fantasy with which he was deluding himself ‚Äì that William Morris kept Jane against her will. He continued this theme, as shown in Proserpine.J. Treuherz, E. Prettejohn, and E. Becker. Dante Gabriel Rossetti. London: Thames & Hudson (2003). Rossetti not only drew Jane exhaustively, he also choreographed photographic sessions of her and used the photographs as preliminary sketches for drawings. Amongst other representations of her, Rossetti depicts Jane as Proserpine, Queen Guinevere and Desdemona ‚Äì all of whom were at the mercy of men.V. Surtees. Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Vol.I, Oxford: Clarendon Press (1971). Jane appears disproportionately large in most of Rossetti's pictures. The background is immaterial as long as the viewer focuses on the beauty of her face. In Pia de' Tolomei her elongated neck seems almost dislocated, and the whiteness of her skin shines out, defying the viewer to pay attention to any other aspects of the painting. Miller's hair colour is misrepresented in the painting. Her natural colour was dark brown, yet Rossetti paints it with an auburn tinge ‚Äì closer to Lizzie Siddal's hair colour than Miller's. Also, her hands are twisted and intertwined in a peculiar way.O. Doughty, A Victorian Romantic: Dante Gabriel Rossetti London: Frederick Muller (1949).

On November 10, 1980, they were added together to the National Register of Historic Places. With Oconto has a long history of French involvement, going back to the Jesuit missionary Allouez and fur-trading days. In 1857 the Catholic church established its first parish in Oconto, St Peter's, building a small wooden church. Initially the congregation was heavily French-American, and the French language was used in services. But there were also non-French Catholics. Over time their numbers grew and they weren't satisfied with the French dominance at St Peter's. In 1869 100 families split off under Father Mathias Schwebach and formed St. Joseph's parish. Most of these families had German, Dutch or Irish roots. To hold the more diverse congregation together, services rotated between English, Dutch, German and Bohemian. Like St. Peter's, St. Joseph's initially built a small wooden church building. St. Peter's Catholic Church But the parishes grew. In 1895 St. Joseph's replaced the wooden building with the brick church that stands today. Carlos Buck of Green Bay designed the new building in High Victorian Gothic style. From the rough stone foundation rise cream brick walls highlighted with red brick trim. Brick buttresses brace the walls. The main entrances on the front are three double doors. Above the central door is a stout tower braced by trompe-l'≈ìil flying buttresses. The tower rises to a pyramidal spire with four smaller spires on the corners. The large central spire is topped with a cross. Behind the tower, an octagonal roof lantern perches where the gables cross. Inside, the ceiling is decorated with ornamental plaster work. When the church was built, various national groups donated stained glass windows depicting their favored saints. In 1899, four years after St. Joseph's built, St. Peter's replaced their wooden church with a brick one. This one was designed by Henry Foeller of Green Bay, done in Romanesque Revival style. Typical of that style, the foundation is rusticated stone and the arches are round-topped. It is all in red brick, with arcades and emphasis on the vertical. Above the one main front entrance is a tall central tower, with a conical spire topped with a cross. The apse at the back of the building is lit by oculi windows.

In 1917, the company acquired the first of the Elstree Studios in Borehamwood from the Neptune Film Company. During the silent era, the Ideal Film Company became one of the leading British production companies, benefiting from the post-First World War boom in films. However the company was badly hit by the Slump of 1924, and stopped its production, while the distribution arm continued. In 1927 the company was merged into the Gaumont British empire, where it continued to distribute under its own name until 1934. During its 23 years, the company distributed almost 400 films and produced more than 80. Most of the films produced by the company are now considered lost, but a number still survive.

Life The grave of William Home Lizars, St Cuthberts, Edinburgh The son of Daniel Lizars, and brother of the surgeon John Lizars, he was born at Edinburgh in 1788, and was educated at the high school there. His sister Jean (Jane) Home married Sir William Jardine. His father was a publisher and an engraver who had been a pupil of Andrew Bell, and engraved portraits as book illustrations. Lizars was first apprenticed to his father, from whom he learnt engraving, and then entered as a student under John Graham in the Trustees' Academy at Edinburgh, where he was a fellow-student with Sir David Wilkie. In 1812, on the death of his father, Lizars had to carry on the business of engraving and copperplate printing in order to support his mother and family. He employed the artists Horatio McCulloch and Daniel Macnee. Another employee was William Howison, mainly on small plates. George Aikman, father of George Aikman the painter, also worked for Lizars before setting up on his own. Lizars encountered J. J. Audubon in Edinburgh in October 1826, introduced (on Audubon's account) with his portfolio by the naturalists Patrick Neill and Prideaux John Selby. So began an intense period when Lizars helped Audubon meet Edinburgh luminaries likely to be useful to him: Robert Jameson, David Brewster and James Wilson in particular. Lizars had a celebrated portrait of Audubon painted (it is now in the White House), by John Syme, in his wolfskin coat, in late November; and the following day took him to meet George Combe and other phrenologists.s:Audubon and His Journals/The European Journals. 1826-1829 Lizars had agreed to publish Audubon's Birds of America. After a promising start, the business did not go well, and Audubon moved the production to London. The work was completed by the Havell family.s:John James Audubon/III. In the early 1830s he is listed as operating from 3 St James Square, in Edinburgh, the centre for printers at that time. He was still living there at the end of his life.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1855 Lizars perfected a method of etching which performed the functions of wood-engraving, for illustration of books. He died in Edinburgh on 30 March 1859, leaving a widow and family. He is buried in St Cuthbert's Churchyard at the west end of Princes Street. His brother John Lizars, surgeon (d.1860) lies with him.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 The grave lies on the small mound, south-west of the church.

From 1808 to 1815, Lizars was a frequent exhibitor of portraits, and of sacred and domestic subjects, at exhibitions in Edinburgh. In 1812 he sent two pictures to the Royal Academy in London, Reading the Will and A Scotch Wedding. They were admired, were hung on the line, and were engraved. They went to the National Gallery of Scotland at Edinburgh. He engraved The Ommeganck at Antwerp, after Gustave Wappers, for the Royal Gallery of Art, and Puck and the Fairies, after Richard Dadd. He also engraved plates of Scottish scenery for publications, and the Anatomical Plates of 1822 for his brother John. Two pictures of churches by Lizars were in the Royal Scottish Academy's collection. There was a pencil drawing by him, done in 1815, of John Flaxman, in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

The insurgency was a direct continuation of events following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Sunni militant groups stepped up attacks targeting the country's majority Shia population to undermine confidence in the Shia-led government and its efforts to protect people without coalition assistance. Armed groups inside Iraq were increasingly galvanized by the Syrian Civil War, with which it merged in 2014. Many Sunni factions stood against the Syrian government, which Shia groups moved to support, and numerous members of both sects also crossed the border to fight in Syria. In 2014, the insurgency escalated dramatically following the conquest of Mosul and major areas in northern Iraq by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a Salafi jihadist militant group and unrecognised proto-state that follows a fundamentalist, Wahhabi doctrine of Sunni Islam. ISIL gained global prominence in early 2014 when it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in its Western Iraq offensive, followed by its capture of Mosul and the Sinjar massacre, thereby merging the new conflict with the Syrian Civil War, into a new, far deadlier conflict. Background The Iraq WarThe conflict is also known as the War in Iraq, the Occupation of Iraq, the Second Gulf War, Gulf War II, and Gulf War 2. The period of the war lasting from 2003 to 2010 was referred to as Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States military. was a protracted armed conflict that began with the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which toppled the government of Saddam Hussein. However, the war continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. The United States officially withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2011, but the insurgency and various dimensions of the civil armed conflict have continued. The invasion began in 2003 when the United States, joined by the United Kingdom and several coalition allies, launched a \\"shock and awe\\" surprise attack without declaring war. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S. forces swept throughout the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam was captured, and he was executed by a military court three years later. However, the power vacuum following Saddam's fall, the mismanagement of the occupation and the sectarian policies of various militias led to a lengthy insurgency against U.S., coalition forces and Iraqi government forces as well as widespread sectarian violence between Shias and Sunnis. The United States responded with a troop surge in 2007; the heavy American security presence and deals made between the occupying forces and Sunni militias reduced the level of violence. The U.S. began withdrawing its troops in the winter of 2007‚Äì2008. The winding down of U.S. involvement in Iraq accelerated under President Barack Obama. The U.S. withdrew all combat troops from Iraq by 2011. The Bush administration based its rationale for war principally on the assertion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and that Saddam's government posed an immediate threat to the United States and its coalition allies.Center for American Progress (29 January 2004) \\"In Their Own Words: Iraq's 'Imminent' Threat\\" americanprogress.orgSenator Bill Nelson (28 January 2004) \\"New Information on Iraq's Possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction\\", Congressional Record Some U.S. officials accused Saddam of harboring and supporting al-Qaeda, while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq.\\"President Discusses the Future of Iraq\\" The White House, 26 February 2003\\"Bush Sought ‚ÄòWay‚Äô To Invade Iraq?\\" 60 Minutes After the invasion, however, no evidence was found to verify the initial claims about WMDs. The rationale and misrepresentation of pre-war intelligence faced heavy criticism within the U.S. and internationally. As a result of the war, Iraq held its multi-party elections in 2005, and Nouri al-Maliki later became Prime Minister the following year. The Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as having the effect of alienating the country's Sunni minority, which worsened sectarian tensions. In 2014, ISIS launched a military offensive in Northern Iraq and later declared a worldwide Islamic caliphate, eliciting another military response from the United States and its allies. The Iraq War caused hundreds of thousands of civilian and military casualties (see estimates). The majority of the casualties occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007. Timeline =2011= As previously planned, the last US combat troops were withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, with security responsibility in the hands of the Iraqi Armed Forces. On 15 December, martial closing ceremony was held in Baghdad putting a formal end to the U.S. mission in Iraq. This ceased direct U.S. combat involvement in the war. The last 500 soldiers left Iraq under cover of darkness and under strict secrecy early on the morning of 18 December 2011, ending the U.S. military presence in Iraq after nearly nine years. On 22 December 2011 at least 72 civilians were killed and more than 170 wounded in a series of bombings across Baghdad, while nine others died in various attacks in Baqubah, Mosul and Kirkuk. =2012= A number of bombings took place in Baghdad and Nasiriyah, killing 73 and leaving 149 injured. The bombing in the southern Iraqi city was targeted at crowds of Shi'ite Muslims and killed at least 44, injuring more than 80 others. It was the first major attack in Nasiriyah since a suicide attack against an Italian army base killed 28 in November 2003, including 19 Italians. ISIS claimed responsibility. A suicide bomber detonated his explosives amid a crowd of Shi'ite pilgrims in Basra, killing 53 and injuring 141. This was the deadliest attack in the city since car bombs in April 2004 killed at least 74. On January 27 ‚Äì A suicide bomber attacked a funeral procession in Baghdad's Zaafaraniyah district, killing 32 and injuring more than 70 others. On February 23 ‚Äì A series of attacks across 15 Iraqi cities left 83 killed and more than 250 injured. ISIS claimed responsibility two days later. On March 5 ‚Äì A gang of gunmen disguised in military-style uniforms and carrying forged arrest warrants killed 27 police and then hoisted the battle flag of al-Qaeda in a carefully planned early morning attack in Anbar Governorate. On March 20 ‚Äì A wave of attacks centered on Baghdad and Kerbala killed at least 52 and left more than 250 injured. ISIS claimed responsibility. On April 19 ‚Äì More than 20 bombs exploded across Iraq, killing at least 36 people and wounding almost 170. ISIS claimed responsibility. On June 4, A suicide bomber killed 26 people and wounded almost 200 at the offices of a Shiite foundation in Baghdad, sparking fears of sectarian strife at a time of political crisis. The attack in the center of the capital was followed later by an explosion near a Sunni religious foundation, causing no casualties. On June 13, At least 93 people were killed and over 300 wounded in a series of highly coordinated attacks across Iraq. ISIS claimed responsibility. 300px On July 3, Explosions in Diwaniyah, Karbala, Taji and Tuz Khormato killed 40 and injured 122 others. On July 22, Car bombs killed 23 and wounded 74 in Baghdad, Mahmoudiyah and Najaf. On July 23, Coordinated attacks across Iraq killed 116 and left 299 injured. ISIS claimed responsibility. On July 31, Attacks across Iraq killed 24 and injured 61, most of them in twin car bombings in Baghdad. On August 13, at least 128 people were killed and more than 400 wounded in coordinated attacks across Iraq, making them the deadliest attacks in the country since October 2009, when 155 were killed in twin bombings near the Justice Ministry in Baghdad. On September 9, A wave of attacks across the country killed at least 108 and left more than 370 others injured. On September 30, A string of attacks occur in at least 10 Iraqi cities, killing 37 and injuring more than 90 others, most of them civilians. On October 27, a wave of attacks during the Eid al-Adha holiday across Iraq killed at least 46 and left 123 injured. Most incidents occurred in Baghdad, Taji, Mosul and Muqdadiya. On October 28, a Car bombings during the last day of Eid left 15 people dead and 33 injured in Baghdad. On November 6, a car bombing outside an army base in Taji killed 31 people and injured at least 50 others, most of them soldiers. The blast struck as troops were leaving the base and potential recruits were lining up for job interviews. On November 14, Insurgents staged a number of attacks on the eve of the Islamic New Year, killing 29 and injuring at least 194 others. The deadliest incidents took place in Kirkuk and Hilla, where at least seven bombings killed 19 and left 129 wounded. Other attacks took place in Baghdad, Mosul, Kut, Fallujah and Baqubah. On November 27, At least 29 people are killed and 126 wounded in eight car bombings across Iraq. Two days of consecutive attacks across northern and central Iraq on December 16 and 17 killed at least 111 and injured 299 others. A significant part of the casualties were from a series of blasts in Kirkuk, Baghdad and Tuz Khormato, where at least 34 died and 154 others were injured. Other incidents took place in Mosul, Tarmiyah, Diwaniyah, Dujail, Tikrit and Baqubah, among others. Most of the attacks appeared to target police officers and members of the Iraqi Army. Sunni protests (2012) After a period of calm, renewed political tension within Iraq led to renewed protests, this time mostly centered around the country's Sunni minority. The main cause for upheaval was the ongoing standoff between Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi and Prime Minister al-Maliki, but strained relationships with the Kurdish autonomous regions added to the scene. On December 23, 2012, several thousand Iraqis marched against al- Maliki, responding to his moves against al-Hashemi and other influential Sunni leaders. =2013= On 4 January, a car bombing in Musayyib killed 28 Shi'ite pilgrims and injured 60 others as they were returning from Karbala. In mid- January, a suicide bomber killed a prominent Sunni MP and six others in Fallujah, two days after Finance Minister Rafi al-Issawi survived an assassination attempt in the same city. The parliamentarian, Ayfan Sadoun al- Essawi, was an important member of the Sons of Iraq committee in Fallujah and part of the opposition to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. A suicide truck- bomber also attacked the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party in Kirkuk, killing 26 and leaving 204 injured. A similar attack against another Kurdish office in Tuz Khormato killed 5 and wounded 40. Later that month, a suicide bomber blew himself up during a funeral for a politician's relative in the city of Tuz Khormato, killing 42 and leaving 75 others wounded. In addition, protests by Sunni Muslims in Iraq against the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki turned deadly in Fallujah, as soldiers opened fire on a crowd of rock-throwing demonstrators, killing 7 and injuring more than 70 others. Three soldiers were later shot to death in retaliation for the incident, and clashes erupted in Askari, on the eastern outskirts of Fallujah. Security forces were placed on high alert as a curfew and vehicle ban were brought into effect. In a statement, Maliki urged both sides to show restraint and blamed the incident on unruly protesters. He also warned that it could lead to a \\"rise in tension that al-Qaida and terrorist groups are trying to take advantage of\\". In February, a suicide car-bomber detonated his vehicle near the provincial police headquarters in Kirkuk, killing at least 36 and injuring 105 others. Among the wounded was Major General Jamal Tahir, the city's chief of police, who had survived a previous attack at almost the same spot two years earlier. Three additional attackers were killed after the initial blast, as they attempted to throw grenades at security forces. Several officers who survived the attack reported that the first bomber was driving a police car and wearing a uniform. When guards at the gate stopped him to check his credentials, he detonated his explosives. In early March, unidentified gunmen ambushed a Syrian Army convoy escorted by Iraqi soldiers in the Battle of Akashat, killing 48 Syrians and 13 Iraqis. The assault took place near the desert border between the two nations in Iraq's Al Anbar Governorate. Authorities suspected the Free Iraqi Army, Jabhat al-Nusra, or al-Qaeda in Iraq of being behind the attack. A week later, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they had \\"annihilated\\" a \\"column of the Safavid army,\\" a reference to the Shia Persian dynasty that ruled Iran from 1501 to 1736. The group also claimed that the presence of Syrian soldiers in Iraq showed \\"firm co-operation\\" between the Syrian and Iraqi governments. In mid- March, a series of coordinated attacks across the capital Baghdad and several major cities in the north and central parts of the country killed at least 98 people and left 240 others injured. The wave of violence was directed mostly at Shia civilians and took place on the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq War. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the attacks. In April, a tanker bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Tikrit, killing at least 42 people and injuring 67 others. Insurgents attacked an oil field near Akaz in a remote part of Al Anbar Governorate, killing 2 engineers and kidnapping a third one. Other attacks across the country left a prison warden in Mosul dead and 11 others injured, including the mayor of Tuz Khormato and at least four journalists, who were stabbed by unknown assailants in a series of attacks on media offices in the capital Baghdad. Five days later, a suicide bomber killed 22 and injured 55 at a political rally for a local Sunni candidate in Baqubah. On April 23, Iraqi Army units moved against an encampment set up by protesters in Hawija, west of the city of Kirkuk, sparking deadly clashes and reprisal attacks across the country. According to army officers, the operation was aimed at Sunni militants from the Naqshbandi Army, who were reportedly involved in the protests. A total of 42 people were killed and 153 others injured, with most of them being protesters - only 3 soldiers were confirmed dead and 7 others wounded. The incident sparked a number of revenge attacks, that soon spread out across much of the country. Minister of Education Mohammed Tamim resigned from his post in response to the Army's operation, and was followed later by Science and Technology Minister Abd al-Karim al- Samarrai. Insurgents from the Naqshbandi Army completely captured the town of Sulaiman Bek, about 170 km north of Baghdad, after heavy fighting with security forces on April 25, only to relinquish control of it a day later, while escaping with weapons and vehicles. More than 340 were killed and 600 others injured in the four days of heaviest violence, while attacks continued after that at a pace higher than earlier in the year. In late May, the Iraqi government launches Operation al-Shabah (Phantom), with the stated aim of severing contact between Al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Syrian al-Nusra Front by clearing militants from the border area with Syria and Jordan. Aftermath From January 2014 onwards, the rise of The Islamic State , a major belligerent in the Syrian Civil War, has transformed the insurgency into a regional war that includes Syria, Iran and a large coalition of Western and Arab forces led by the United States.

The city is built upon a precipitous hilltop, walled from the north and fortified naturally from the other directions. It was the capital of the Yu øfirids Muslim dynasty (847-997) and it was a capital of Bani Sharaf Al-Deen in the 9th 15th century. It was also home to a Jewish community, until its demise in the mid-20th century. The city affords a good prospect of the surrounding countryside. The meaning of the word kawkaban in Arabic means \\"two planets\\". The city features several old mosques: al Madrasa, al Mansoor, al Sharefa and Harabat. The old market is located in the middle of the city. Old rainwater reservoirs can also be seen in the fortified town, named Meseda, Alasdad, and Sedalhamam.  History  Kawkaban Gate The town is known as Shibam Kawkaban because it is located on a mountain called Kawkaban. It was also known as Shibam Ya·∏•bis, Shibam ·∏§imyar and Shibam Aqyan. The Yu øfirids Muslim dynasty (847-997) that emerged in the Yemen is originally from Shibam Kawkaban. Shibam Kawkaban became their capital. In the early 20th century, the mountain village was visited by German explorer and photographer, Hermann Burchardt, who wrote in May 1902: \\"Kawkaban, a now completely deserted town that still 40 years ago counted 30,000 inhabitants, but now hardly holds a few hundred; [it] also has its Jewish quarter, where still some families live.\\"Hermann Burchardt, Die Juden in Yemen, in: \\"Ost und West\\", Berlin 1902, p. 340. Of the city's more popular citizens was the renowned Jewish poet, Zechariah Dhahiri. On February 2016 as part of the Yemeni Civil War fighter jets from U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition struck the town citadel killing seven residents and destroying the historic gateway as well as the 700-year-old houses.‚ÄòWhy is the world so quiet?‚Äô Yemen suffers its own cruel losses, far from Aleppo.  Climate  highest mountain in the Arabian Peninsula, Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb of the Haraz- Sarat Mountains, as viewed from Kawkaban Kawkaban has a distinct moderate semi-arid climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification (BSh). Due to its outstanding elevation that nears , the town receives larger diurnal ranges and more precipitation compared to the capital nearby Sanaa. The plentiful rainfall is a direct result to its exposed location (not shielded by any natural barriers) being on top of a mountain and its rugged terrain; both factors leading to occasional orographic lifts rising from nearby slopes.

The House of Al-Arqam The harassment and persecution of Muslims by Quraysh polytheists (mushriks) in Mecca was increasing, and the Muslims could not worship comfortably. Al-Arqam's house was selected as a safe place to meet, pray and learn about the faith because it was located on the east of As-Safa Hill, where Muhammad was living at the commencement of his prophetic mission. The house could be entered and exited secretly because it was in a narrow street, and the street could be surveyed from within. In the fifth year of the mission Arqam‚Äôs house, which became known as the House of Islam, can be regarded as the first Islamic school, with Muhammad as the teacher and the first Muslims as its students. New converts were brought to Al-Arqam's house. In the sixth year of the mission (615-616 CE), two powerful citizens of the Quraysh tribe, Muhammad‚Äôs uncle Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib and Umar ibn Al-Khattab, entered to announce their adoption of Islam.Ibn Saad/Bewley, pp. 3, 206. Umar's conversion brought the total to forty men, after which the members of the group embarked on a mission to spread Islam to the world. Al-Arqam bequeathed his house to his son on the condition that it would not be sold. However, in the time of Abu Jaafar al- Mansur, one of Al-Arqam's grandsons was persuaded to sell his share in the house for 17,000 dinars in exchange for being released from prison; and his relatives were then bribed into selling their own shares.Ibn Saad/Bewley, p. 186.

It was mentioned first in 1432 as Olbersdorff and is part of the town of Hohnstein since 1994.  Geography  Ulbersdorf has the form of a Reihendorf (row village) and is located in the eastern part of the municipality on a plateau and its neighbouring side valley of the Sebnitz. The village is situated about 10 km southeast of the town centre of Hohnstein and about 5 km of the centre of the neighbouring town Sebnitz. Surrounding villages are Krumhermsdorf (N), Sch√∂nbach (NE), Hainersdorf (E), Lichtenhain (SE), Mittelndorf (S), Altendorf (SW), Go√üdorf and Lohsdorf (W). Ulbersdorf railway station lies on the Bautzen‚ÄìBad Schandau railway.  History  Ulbersdorf church Ulbersdorf has been founded as a Waldhufendorf during the second phase of the German eastward expansion. It was first mentioned in 1432, in 1433 the church from the 12th/13th century was first mentioned, too. A 1433 mentioned vorwerk became a manor in the 16th century and even a second manor was built. For the most of the time both manors belonged to the same families. Wolf Adolf August von L√ºttichau (1786‚Äì1863) was born in Ulbersdorf. He became later intendant of the Saxon State Theatre in Dresden. He and his wife Ida von L√ºttichau (1798‚Äì1856) used Ulbersdorf manor as a second residence. In 1877 the Bautzen‚ÄìBad Schandau railway line was built between the Upper Lusatian town Bautzen and Schandau at the river Elbe. Ulbersdorf railway station was located outside the village. A World War I memorial was built in 1923. Additions were made to it after World War II. In 1947 a land reform happened in Ulbersdorf like in most municipalities within the Soviet occupation zone. On 1 January 1994 the municipalities Ehrenberg, Go√üdorf, Lohsdorf, Rathewalde and Ulbersdorf were incorporated into the town of Hohnstein.  Literature  * Ulbersdorf, Krs.

The reason The cause of the controversy was an article published in the Sydney based The Sun-Herald newspaper on 25 June 1972. Written by motoring journalist, Channel 7 television commentator and successful race and rally driver Evan Green and entitled \\"160 MPH 'Super Cars' Soon\\", it claimed that Australia's three major car manufacturers, General Motors-Holden's, Ford Australia and Chrysler Australia (commonly called \\"The Big Three\\"), were each about to produce new models, based on family saloons but with top speeds of up to . Although some rural roads at the time had no speed limits, the maximum limit on most roads in Australia was . The intent by each manufacturer was to sell at least 200 units of their respective models to the public, thus making the cars eligible for the Hardie-Ferodo 500, a major motor race held on the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, New South Wales. At the time, the race was run under Group E Series Production regulations, meaning that the cars that raced had to be available for sale to the general public, although cars used in the race had safety features such as roll cages and racing seat belts. (the Hardie- Ferodo 500 mile race was a forerunner to the current \\"Bathurst 1000\\" event) Prior to the article being published, a magazine had shown a Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III being driven at over on a public highway. The cars The proposed models were a , 5.0 L V8-engined version of the Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1, the Ford Falcon GTHO Phase IV powered by a 5.8 L V8 engine, and an upgraded version of the Chrysler Valiant Charger fitted with a 4.3 L Hemi-6 engine. The Ford Falcon GTHO Phase IV was a casualty of the \\"Supercar scare\\" While testing the prototype Torana V8 in a Sports Sedan race at Bathurst during the Easter weekend in 1972, Holden Dealer Team (HDT) boss Harry Firth calculated that the car, driven by regular HDT driver Colin Bond, reached on the 2km long Conrod Straight. He also noted that the V8 was a regular road car engine (with minimal modifications) and not a blueprinted race engine. Firth ran the car in Sports Sedans (fitted with front and rear spoilers) in a successful attempt to disguise that the V8 Torana was intended to be raced in the Bathurst 500 later in the year. Firth also had team mechanic/driver Larry Perkins drive the Torana from Melbourne to Bathurst with instructions to \\"Go as fast as you can\\", with Firth in his hotted up Holden Monaro secretly following Perkins the entire way, and noting that the Torana was getting away from Firth while he was doing . The entire journey to Bathurst was completed in a mere 4 hours and 33 minutes, a record that stands to this day. The team also ran their regular six-cylinder car in the Series Production races that weekend, giving Firth a valuable guide in how much faster the V8 engined car was compared to the six (the V8 lapped over 5 seconds faster), and how it would compare to the V8 powered Ford XY Falcon GTHO Phase 3's. The V8 Torana was not only faster than the Phase 3's, but around 5 seconds per lap faster than the team's 6cyl XU-1 Torana driven by Peter Brock. Chrysler Australia tested V8-powered Valiants that \\"went like Hell\\" according to Ian (Pete) Geoghegan. Similarly powered vehicles in the United States were winning many races in the Trans-Am series. Two VH Valiant Chargers with 340ci engines, 4-speed manual transmissions, and heavy duty Chrysler-built rear axles were sighted briefly in a Melbourne dealership only days prior to the publishing of Evan Green's article; this pair had \\"disappeared\\" by the very next morning (Monday 26th). Government reaction The article quoted New South Wales Transport Minister Milton Morris as saying that he was appalled at these cars - which he labelled \\"bullets on wheels\\" \\\\- being sold to ordinary motorists and that \\"if manufacturers are making these supercars available to the general public because this is a condition of eligibility for the Bathurst 500, then I think it is imperative that race organisers closely examine their rules.\\" Green went on to say that the models would introduce new standards of handling and control in Australian high performance cars and he quoted HDT boss Harry Firth as saying that the proposed Torana V8 model would be \\"the best handling, safest car on the road.\\" While Firth was insistent that the V8 XU-1 handled better than the six- cylinder version, HDT driver Peter Brock, who also raced the car in Sports Sedans, later claimed that while the V8 was a lot faster in a straight line, its handling was terrible and he reported that in testing, the first time both he and Colin Bond gave the car full acceleration it broke the windscreen due to the V8's much greater torque. On the following Wednesday, Morris said he would \\"seek a national ban on such cars\\"Qld joins bid to ban fast cars, The Sydney Morning Herald, Friday, 30 June 1972, page 3/ and the following day the Queensland Minister of Transport, Mr Hooper joined in calling for a \\"national ban on the registration of popular make high-performance cars capable of speeds in excess of 130 mph\\". In another announcement on that Thursday, Mr D Thomson, secretary of the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport, stated that regulations would be changed to discontinue all \\"series production car\\" races and allow manufacturers to race specially modified race vehicles derived from a production vehicle.'Super-car' era to end soon, The Sydney Morning Herald, Friday, 30 June 1972 Thomson also said that the Bathurst 500 \\"had created large problems, one of the greatest of which was the marketing of the 'super- cars'\\". The Backdown On Friday, 30 June 1972, a spokesman for General Motors-Holden's announced that the company had abandoned its plans to build and race a V8 powered Torana \\"because of concern expressed by government leaders\\".GM-H quits power race, The Sydney Morning Herald, 1 July 1972, page 1. On the same day a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company stated that \\"We are considering the situation\\" and a spokesman for Chrysler Australia Ltd claimed that \\"The Charger R/T is not a super-car\\". The following day Ford announced that it would not continue with production of its new GTHO and that the company would seek government guidelines for the production of performance cars.Evan Green and Peter Allen, 'Big Three' all drop high-speed supercar plans, The Sun-Herald, July 2, 1972, page 3 & 27. On the same day, Chrysler said that it had abandoned development of a V8 competition version of the Charger R/T and that it would \\"withdraw from \\"direct participation\\" in series production racing, including the Bathurst 500\\". Chrysler also reported that the V8 Charger was not intended for the 1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500, though Chrysler factory backed racing brothers Leo and Ian Geoghegan did test a ute fitted with a 5.6 liter (340 cui) V8 engine and with the R/T Charger's wheelbase at the Mallala circuit in South Australia. The Geoghegan's reported that while faster on the straights, the extra weight of the V8 gave the car severe understeer and required earlier brake points due to the brakes being the same size as those on the six-cylinder Hemi Chargers (the Geoghegan's reports on the V8 Chrysler mirrored Peter Brock's later comments about the V8 Torana). As a result, lap times in testing were around two to three seconds slower than when the car was fitted with the lighter Hemi six, though it was expected that the long straights and more open nature of the Mount Panorama Circuit would better suit the more powerful V8 engine car. Pete Geoghegan also road tested the V8 ute on the country roads surrounding the town of Mallala and reported that while the top speed was a vast improvement over the Hemi-6, the extra weight of the V8 did not stop the front of the car feeling 'light' at high speeds. While there was government outrage that the \\"Big Three\\" were to produce such supercars for public sale in Australia, it was pointed out that those who could afford to do so could still buy high powered imported sports cars such as those made by Ferrari, Porsche and Jaguar that came with performance capabilities that rivaled or surpassed the proposed Australian cars. While these cars were somewhat more expensive to buy in Australia, it was argued that drivers had as much chance of having a fatal accident in a high powered import as they did in an Australian-made car. The aftermath Following the shelving of the so-called \\"Supercars\\", the 1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500 went ahead under Series Production rules. The race was won by Peter Brock in a six cylinder LJ Torana GTR XU-1 for Firth's Holden Dealer Team. The following year, CAMS introduced the Group C touring car rules which would last until the end of 1984. The Bathurst 500 was also increased from 500 miles to 1000 kilometres from 1973. Evan Green, the journalist/racer who started the Supercar Scare, was also a television motorsport commentator for Channel 7 in Sydney, which broadcast Bathurst 1000. For many years after 1972, Green was shunned or given short answers by HDT boss Harry Firth, whose team had carried out all the development of the V8 Torana. Firth also claimed that he personally lost some A$55,000 of his own money on the cars, with all four prototypes meeting their end on the crash pad at Holden's Lang Lang proving ground. This was also true of factory Ford driver Allan Moffat who had been heavily involved in the testing and development of the Phase IV Falcon (four were built and three are known to survive as of 2020). While Firth later claimed that Green was \\"No friend of mine\\" following the Supercar scare, Moffat softened his stance over the years and allowed Green to interview him both in the pits and also in his Melbourne workshop. Unlike Ford and Holden, Chrysler Australia chose to pull out of racing after 1972 (Ford also did after 1973, but returned in 1976). Chrysler introduced both the 5.3L and 5.6L V8 engines to its luxury sedans, though both were heavily de-tuned. Ford continued to produce its V8 powered Ford Falcon GT range until the GT was discontinued after the Ford XB Falcon, though the Falcon continued with the V8 until Ford pulled the plug on it in 1983. Although the 5.0L V8 was already part of the larger Monaro and Kingswood range, Holden introduced the V8 to the Torana range in 1974 with the Holden LH Torana SLR/5000.

It was built by St. Matthias parish of the Episcopal Church, now in the Diocese of Milwaukee, and is the oldest church building in Waukesha that survives basically intact. The Waukesha congregation began in 1839 or 1840 when Rev. Lemuel B. Hull of St. Paul's in Milwaukee walked out into the wilds to conduct the first Episcopal services there. In 1843 those early Episcopalians built a little chapel on Barstow Street. In 1844 the parish was formally organized, and in 1848 Rev. James Abercrombie became rector. With In 1851 the parish began constructing the large limestone-clad building that still stands today. The cornerstone was laid that year with initial pledges of $1,000, but that proved insufficient, and Rev. Abercrombie had to go back east for $4,000 more for the building. The building's style is Gothic Revival, with its emphasis on the vertical clear in the spire and the pointed arches topping the windows and doorways. The walls are of local limestone, dressed, and randomly coursed. The main entrance is through the corner tower. The tower is square, with the lower parts flanked by diagonal buttresses, and the top capped with a spire that rises to a cross.

In several occasions, the buildings were considered for demolition as part of a beautification plan for Oslo Cathedral.

In the later project, panels of dark green stone replaced terracotta pilasters, and cast concrete panels replaced terracotta window surrounds on the second floor and glass transoms on the first floor. The building was connected to the Des Moines skywalk system in 2002.

The NunatuKavut people (also called Inuit-Metis or Labrador Metis) are the direct descendants of the Inuit that lived south of the Churchill or Grand River prior to European contact, with European influence from Basque and French whalers. Nunatuƒ∏avut or NunatuKavut means \\"Our ancient land\\" in the ancestral Inuttut dialect of the NunatuKavummuit people. The Nunatuƒ∏avut region encompasses Southern Labrador, from the Grand River south to Lodge Bay and west to the extent of the official border between Quebec and Labrador. However, the land use area is much more extensive. History =Early European contact= The area was known as Markland in Greenlandic Norse and its inhabitants were known as skr√¶lingjar. In 1652, an Inuit community was recorded in what is now the C√¥te-Nord region of Quebec. In 1659, Jacques Fremin described an Inuit community at Cape St. Charles. Louis Fornel named the area from Alexis Bay to Hamilton Inlet the \\"Coste des Eskimaux\\" in 1743 and claimed there was Inuit living around St. Michael's Bay (\\"Baye des Meniques\\"), Hawke Bay, Martin Bay and Hamilton Inlet. =Post-1763: Creation of Labrador and European contact= St. John's River (now Rivi√®re-Saint-Jean, Quebec)Labrador's boundary according to the Canadian government before 1927. In 1763 Labrador was ceded to the Colony of Newfoundland. It included coastal area between the St. John's River and Cape Chidley and was meant as extra fishing grounds for Newfoundland fishermen. Labrador has been created using territory from the French colony of New France and the British colony of Rupert's Land. The inland boundary of Labrador was undefined until 1927 so Canada claimed the interior of Labrador as part of Quebec and the Northwest Territories while Newfoundland claimed that Labrador extended far inland. Labrador was ceded back to New France (now Lower Canada) and Rupert's Land in 1791 but then in 1809 it rejoined Newfoundland. In 1825 Blanc-Sablon and territory to the west was ceded to Lower Canada however this region (Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality) remains culturally close to NunatuKavut. In 1764, Jens Haven arrived at Quirpon, Newfoundland and to Chateau Bay. He was a missionary from the Moravian Church. Haven learned the Inuit language and explained to them that the Colony of Newfoundland wished to enter a peaceful relationship with them. Haven had previously worked in Greenland which is where he learnt the Greenlandic language (which is a similar language to the Inuttitut language spoken by Labradorian Inuit). In 1765, Governor Sir Hugh Palliser signed the \\"Labrador Treaty\\" with Inuit leaders at Chateau Bay. The British would protect Labrador from French and American influence while the Inuit would have the right to self-government, harvest of wildlife and natural resources. The Inuit had sided with the British during the Seven Years' War and fought a battle against the French and Innu at Battle Harbour. The Inuit had previously had a poor relationship with the French. In 1741, the Inuit revolted against the French at Cape St. Charles. The Inuit were also known to attack Basque fishermen around the Strait of Belle Isle. The 1765 treaty ensured a peaceful relationship between the Inuit and the fishermen from England and Newfoundland. The Moravian Church set up missionary posts in northern Labrador since the British hoped to colonize the south. They restricted access by Europeans to territory between Cape Chidley and Cape Harrison which created a cultural divide between the Inuit of the north and the Inuit of the south. The Moravians established one post south of Cape Harrison which was at Makkovik however a large number of the Inuit in Makkovik were mixed race similar to the ones in the south. European influence in the southern part of Nunatsiavut is still notable today as common surnames in Postville, Makkovik and Rigolet are mostly European names such as \\"Anderson\\", \\"Baikie\\", \\"Broomfield\\", \\"Jacque\\", \\"Michelin\\" and \\"Williams\\" while common surnames in Nain and Hopedale (both north of Cape Harrison) include \\"Aggek\\", \\"Ikkusek\\", \\"Karpik\\", \\"Okkuatsiak\\" and \\"Pamak\\". =1800s: Intermarriage between the Inuit and Europeans= A former Newfoundland Ranger Force detachment in Port Hope Simpson.Birchy Cove, Labrador in 1908.North West River in 1894. In 1810, an Englishman named William Phippard married an Inuk woman named \\"Sarah\\" and they had a son. Some other English fishermen started marrying Inuit woman as well during this time. They were later joined by large numbers of fishermen from Conception Bay and Trinity Bay (who were mostly of English and Irish descent). Many Inuit in southern Labrador took European names. Some of them used anglicised surnames such as \\"Paulo\\", \\"Kippenhuck\\", \\"Shuglo\\", \\"Tuccolk\\", \\"Elishoc\\", \\"Alliswack\\", \\"Penneyhook\\", \\"Tooktusheena\\" and \\"Maggo\\" (\\"Kippenhuck\\" and \\"Toomashie\\" are the only remaining Inuit surnames (excluding names of people that have moved to NunatuKavut from other places), (\\"Penneyhook\\" has become \\"Penney\\"). In 1824, it was recorded that the population around Lake Melville consisted of 160 Inuit, 90 European settlers and 60 \\"half-breeds\\" (people of European and Inuit descent). Of marriages recorded between 1773 and 1891 in southern and central Labrador, it was shown that 152 married people were Inuit, 27 were European, 14 were mixed and 1 was Mi'kmaq while the ethnic origin of 26 people could not be identified. The racial composition of southern Labrador during the 1800s was a mix of the Inuit and English settlers while the north remained Inuit dominant. The culture of southern Labrador was (and remains) a unique blend of Newfoundland's Celtic-influenced culture and the native Inuit culture. The 1935 census showed that almost every resident of Labrador between Cape St. Charles and Cape Harrison had some Aboriginal background. Newfoundland exerted significantly more control over Labrador than Canada did over its northern regions. The Newfoundland Ranger Force enforced colonial laws in Labrador like it also did in rural Newfoundland. =Post-confederation= Battle Harbour, a resettled community near Mary's Harbour. In 1946, the Dominion of Newfoundland conducted an election to choose delegates for the Newfoundland National Convention. This was the first time that an election was held in Labrador and Lester Burry of Bonavista Bay was elected to represent Labrador. Burry wanted the Dominion of Newfoundland to become a province of Canada and in 1949, Newfoundland became Canada's 10th province. Before confederation, most Inuit lived in small settlements of a few families in isolated harbours and on islands off the coast of Labrador. During the 1950s and 1960s many communities across the province were resettled to larger population centres as part of a provincial government-sponsored program. The collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery also had a huge impact on NunatuKavut like it had on the province as a whole and many people left the province to find work elsewhere. In 1996, the then-Labrador Metis Association vigorously protested the KGY Group's proposed Eagle River fishing camp. The issue came up as a result of a decision by the provincial government in 1996 to call for proposals for the development of a quality sports fishing camp on the Eagle River in Labrador. Corner Brook based KGY Group (a non-aboriginal application) was selected over a Labrador company. The Labrador Metis Association claimed Eagle River as a traditional salmon fishing area of NunatuKavut. For about nine days in 1996, hundreds of residents from Cartwright and nearby communities in the Sandwich Bay area kept a supply vessel and helicopter from delivering materials to the construction site. A joint RCMP and Coast Guard operation arrested at least 47 residents involved in the protests and charged most of them with mischief. In June 1999 the Crown entered a stay of proceedings on all charges laid against members of the Labrador Metis Nation during the Eagle River protests. In 2002, a gravel road opened between Red Bay and Cartwright. This road was later extended to reach Happy Valley-Goose Bay. If NunatuKavut was recognized as one of Canada's Inuit regions by the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, then it would be the only one with a highway network reaching most of its communities (the town of Inuvik is connected to Yukon by road and is the only recognized Inuit community that is accessible by road). In the mid-2010s, Labrador Inuit-Metis began calling themselves the Southern Inuit of NunatuKavut. NunatuKavut claims to represent 6,000 Inuit covering a third of Labrador's landmass. It is more densely populated than Nunatsiavut or any other Inuit region. Many residents of anglophone communities in northeastern Quebec (between the Natashquan River and the Strait of Belle Isle, sometimes called the \\"forgotten Labrador\\") claim a similar Inuit and European heritage as the people of NunatuKavut. Lower Churchill Project The NunatuKavut have been vocal in their opposition to the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project. Flag In 2016, the NunatuKavut Community Council unveiled a proposal for its flag. The flag was designed by Barry Pardy of Cartwright.

Little was known about the history of the \\"Inuit-Metis\\" of the time. In 2006, the Labrador Metis Association initiated a project with Memorial University to better understand their past through the Community-University Research Association (CURA). Following research by CURA, the \\"Labrador Metis\\" were understood to be a continuation of the Inuit people of southern Labrador. In 2010, the Labrador Metis Association changed its name to reflect their newly discovered heritage, and became the NunatuKavut Community Council. In an effort to enforce the treaty of 1765, NunatuKavut launched a land claim with the federal government that is currently being negotiated. As a part of this land claim, the NunatuKavut Community Council asserts that the Muskrat Falls and Lower Churchill hydroelectric project fall on their territory.

Now his luck has changed. His two daughters are out of control: Ten-year-old Scottie is a disrespectful troublemaker with a desperate need for attention, and seventeen- year-old Alex, a former model, is a recovering drug addict. Matt's wife, Joanie, lies in a coma after a boat-racing accident and will soon be taken off life support. The Kings can hardly picture life without her, but as they come to terms with this tragedy, their sadness is mixed with a sense of freedom that shames them--and spurs them into surprising actions. Before honoring Joanie's living will, Matt must gather her friends and family to say their final goodbyes, a difficult situation made worse by the sudden discovery that there is one person who has not been told: the man with whom Joanie had been having an extramarital affair, quite possibly the one man she ever truly loved. Forced to examine what he owes not only to the living but to the dead, Matt takes to the road with his daughters to find his wife's lover, a memorable journey that leads to both painful revelations and unforeseen humor and growth.

In 1987 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its significance in architecture and social history. Mukwonago was founded in 1836 by three Yankees from New England. Forty years later, two of those founders were still alive and helped to found this church. Sewell Andrews was a Universalist and Martin Field was a Unitarian. These were two separate denominations at the time, which would not formally merge for eighty years, but in Mukwonago they decided to form a joint congregation, chartering the town's Unitarian and Universalist church society in 1877. The following year the society started building its church right in the middle of Mukwonago, a block south of the main intersection and across the street from the homes of Andrews and Field. They chose an unusual but practical model for their building, with a public meeting hall on the first floor and worship space above. The style of the building is a pretty standard white frame church like what the founders probably knew from New England. The styling is Victorian Gothic, characterized by strict symmetry and the pointed arches in all the upper openings, all pointing to heaven. With The steeple was originally topped with a spire, but that was removed after it was struck by lightning around 1906. The windows of the first floor public meeting hall are less \\"churchy,\\" with round-topped arches. The new building was dedicated in August 1879, with a dedication sermon from Olympia Brown, the first woman ordained as a minister in the U.S. and a women's suffragette. Brown preached part-time at the church for years after. Some other early women ministers included Carrie Rice, Nellie Opdahl, and Florence Pollack, attesting to the congregation's liberal leaning for the time. The public hall downstairs hosted many other organizations, including the local Good Templars, the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Territorial Badgers, the Modern Woodmen, the Royal Neighbors, the village's creamery company, the Farmer's Mutual Insurance Company, along with town meetings. The building was shared with other denominations before they could build their own churches, including the German Lutheran Church, the Catholic Advancement Association, the Methodist Episcopal Society, and the United Church of Christ. Mukwonago had two other early churches from the same era - the 1872 Congregational church and the 1879 Baptist church - but both were demolished in the 1970s or 80s, leaving the Unitarian Universalist church as the only survivor from that Yankee era. The UU church is very little changed from when it was built, other than the missing spire. In 2007 the Unitarian Universalist congregation moved from this building into Waukesha and this building was bought by the Episcopal Church of the Resurrection.

The state's attorney in L√ºneburg delayed the trial until the end of the 1960s, when it was dropped. From 1951 to 1953, Weisenborn was chief dramaturge at the Hamburg Kammerspiele. In 1953, he published his book, Der lautlose Aufstand (The Silent Rebellion), the first comprehensive report documenting the German Resistance. Lecture tours took him to Asia (Burma, the People's Republic of China, India and the Soviet Union), as well as to London, Paris, Prague and Warsaw. Weisenborn became ever more involved as a pacifist against rearming West Germany and warned of the atomic threat it posed. In 1955, he wrote the screenplay for Falk Harnack's film, Der 20. Juli (The Plot to Assassinate Hitler), for which he received the German Film Prize in silver. In 1955, Weisenborn also created the \\"Silver Leaf\\", one of the two prizes awarded by the Dramatiker Union. Given exclusively to non-members, the honorary award is bestowed on individuals who have especially supported and nurtured contemporary dramatic works.Auszeichnungen Die Dramatiker Union. Retrieved January 28, 2012 His later film work included documentaries about the German Resistance to the Third Reich and the screenplay for Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera. Weisenborn moved to West Berlin in 1964.  Awards and recognition  Weisenborn was chairman of the Schutzverbandes deutscher Autoren (\\"Association of German Authors\\"), a member of the Free Academy of the Arts in Hamburg, the German Academy of the Performing Arts, then with offices in Frankfurt am Main, corresponding member of the Akademie der K√ºnste in Berlin, then located in East Berlin, the P.E.N.

Brevard County is a county in the U.S. state of Florida, along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic boundaries of the county have changed significantly since its founding. The county is named for Judge Theodore W. Brevard, an early setter, and state comptroller. The official county seat has been located in Titusville since 1894, although most of the county's administration is performed from Viera. History =Precolumbian= The first Paleoindians arrived in the area near Brevard county between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. The Paleoindians were semi-nomadic people who lived in smaller groups. At that time, the earth was warming from its most recent ice age. The climate of the area then was very different from now; it was similar to that of Great Britain today. The area which today is Brevard County was probably not coastal at this period in time. The coast of Florida was about wider and the Indian River was simply a lower point on dry land. After a few thousand years, perhaps by around 3000 B.C. peninsular Florida resembled the land of today; in shape, climate, fauna, and flora. The ocean had risen enough to flood the Indian River with salt water. About this time, a new group of settlers appeared known as \\"the archaic people.\\" These people were primarily fishermen, as opposed to the hunting and gathering way of life which characterized the Paleoindians. It is believed that these were the ancestors of the Native Americans who would come in contact with the Europeans when they arrived. =From Spanish rule to statehood= The Ais and the Jaega were the dominant tribes in the area when it is thought that Ponce De Leon landed on the shores near Melbourne Beach in 1513. There were about 10,000 of these natives in the area. In 1565, French survivors from Jean Ribault's Fort Caroline whose ship the Trinite wrecked on the shores of Cape Canaveral and from whose timbers, a fort was built. Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s gave an early account of the Ais Indians in 1570 when he was shipwrecked off of Cape Canaveral. He faced hostile natives but though the use of a bluff was able to escape from them and get back to St. Augustine. In 1605, Alvero Mexia was dispatched from St. Augustine to the Indian River area on a diplomatic mission to the Ais Indian Nation. He helped establish a \\"Period of Friendship\\" with the Ais Caciques(Chiefs) and made a color map of the area. Heavy mosquito infestation and the threat of Indian attacks kept the area from having any permanent white settlements. The Spanish quickly left the area, but left a deadly reminder of their visit: European diseases. In 1763, the Spanish took the last 80 natives to Cuba. Within 200 years, almost the entire precolumbian population of Florida had died out. Creek Indians from the north quickly swept down from Georgia and the Carolinas to fill the void. These Indians became known as the Seminole. Their activity in Brevard County was intermittent and usually not permanent. Between 1650 and 1720 the area that is today Brevard County was very remote and inaccessible to Europeans. As a result of this the only Europeans in this time period to visit what has since become Brevard County and Indian River County were pirates, the vast and overwhelming majority of whom were British. Spanish ships laden with gold would travel via the gulf stream, and British pirates would hide in the then-remote waters off of the coast of Florida. Throughout the 18th century, the great European powers Spain, Great Britain and France vied for power in Florida. Their interest in the peninsula was more strategic than for building any real settlements. In contrast to today, where living in Florida means comfort and the \\"good life\\" to many people, Florida in the 18th century was seen as a hostile place with dangerous fauna such as venomous snakes, alligators and panthers. Death by malaria was a possibility and death at the hands of angry Indians seemed even more likely. After being under Spanish, French, British, and then Spanish rule again, Florida finally became a United States territory. In 1837, Fort Ann was established on the eastern shore of the Indian River on a narrow strip of land on Merritt Island. During the construction of the Hern√°ndez‚ÄìCapron Trail, General Joseph Hernandez and his militiamen encamped near present-day Mims. These settlements were short lived and were abandoned shortly thereafter. =Statehood to 1900= St. Lucie County In 1845, Florida became the 27th state of the Union. During the 19th century, the state of Florida was constantly changing the names and borders of counties. St. Lucie County was split off from Mosquito County in 1844. St. Lucie County was renamed Brevard County in 1855 after Theodore Washington Brevard, who served as Florida Comptroller from 1854 to 1860. This \\"Brevard County\\" contained very little of present-day Brevard County. Most of present-day Brevard north of Melbourne was part of either Volusia or Orange counties. Brevard County in 1856 extended as far west as Polk County and as far south as coastal Dade County. Complicating the discussion of Brevard County in the 19th century is that the boundaries have shifted such that the southernmost parts of present- day Brevard, were originally the northernmost parts.Shofner, Jerrell H., History of Brevard County Volume 1 The original county seat was located at Susannah, an early name for present day Fort Pierce. Later the southern part of Brevard split off to form a new county, St. Lucie County in 1905. Gradually, the borders of Brevard County were shifted northward while the county got \\"pinched\\" eastward. The portions of Brevard County in present-day Broward and Palm Beach counties were given to Dade County, western areas of the county were given to Polk and Osceola County, and parts of Volusia and Orange Counties were given to Brevard including the eventual county seat of Titusville. Later, the southern portion of the county was cut off to form St. Lucie County, which in turn spawned Martin and Indian River County. The first permanent settlement in present-day Brevard was established near Cape Canaveral in 1848. After the establishment of a lighthouse, a few families moved in and a small, but stable settlement was born. Gradually, as the threat of Seminole Indian attacks became increasingly unlikely, European Americans began to move into the area around the Indian River. In the 1850s a small community developed at Sand Point, which eventually became the city of Titusville. Unlike other areas of Florida, the American Civil War had little effect on Brevard County, other than perhaps to slow the movement of settlers to the area. In 1864, the county seat was moved to Bassvile, an area presently in Osceola County on the southeast shore of Lake Tohopekaliga. In 1874, the county seat was moved to Eau Gallie. Then in 1875 the seat was moved to Lake View. In 1870, the Barber‚ÄìMizell feud erupted due to resentment over Reconstruction, a boundary dispute with Orange County, and cattle taxation. Boathouse, Titusville, Florida 1885. By the 1880s, the cities along the Indian River included Melbourne, Eau Gallie, Titusville, Rockledge, and Cocoa. Unlike cities further inland in Florida, these cities did not have to rely as heavily on roads. The primary way of transversing the county was by water. In 1877 commercial steamboat transportation became a reality as the steamboat Pioneer was brought to the area. The first real boom to the area occurred with the extension of Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad into the area. The railroad reached Titusville in 1886 and Melbourne in 1894. With the railroad came increased settlement and the first tourists. In 1895, the first library in Brevard County was established in Cocoa as a community effort undertaken by the women of Cocoa. In 1959, after five libraries had been established in Brevard County, Florida Statute 150 was put into effect to provide public funding to these libraries in recognition that they would serve all residents in Brevard County. In the 1960s, the number of libraries in the county increased to 9. Further funding was secured for the Brevard County Library System in 1972 through a public vote establishing a Library Tax District. As the area's population grew, the number of libraries in the county nearly doubled in the following 50 years. =20th century to present= Crane Creek, Melbourne circa 1900 The advent of the automobile age brought accelerated growth to Brevard County as resorts and hotels were developed all around the county. As the automobile became increasingly important as a means of transportation, roads were built connecting Brevard County to the rest of Florida, and ultimately the rest of the nation. Ferries provided the first connections across the rivers, and were replaced by wooden bridges in the early 20th century. They had gates to allow the passage of boats through the waterways. The first major land boom began in the 1920s after the end of World War I. People flooded into the state of Florida, both tourists from northern winters and new full-time residents, and land prices soared. The Great Depression temporarily stopped growth in Florida. Before the start of World War II, the largest industries in Brevard were commercial fishing, citrus, and tourism. In 1940, the government built Naval Air Station Banana River (now Patrick Air Force Base). This military installation was the first of major federal investment in projects to aid the development of Brevard County. The federal government also funded construction of what is now Florida State Road A1A, paralleling the ocean and providing vehicle access to the NAS. It funded the replacement of the three wooden bridges connecting the mainland to the barrier island with concrete ones. The wooden bridges had still accommodated both horses and wagons, and automobiles. The Melbourne-Eau Gallie airport was given $5 million in upgrades to become a major regional airport. As in the rest of the state and most of the South, African Americans in the county were largely disenfranchised and oppressed by Jim Crow conditions, but beginning to organize to restore their constitutional rights. Beginning in the 1930s, Harry T. Moore was a civil rights leader, teacher, and founder of the Brevard County NAACP. After the war he became president of the state NAACP. After the Supreme Court had ruled in 1944 that white primaries were unconstitutional, he conducted voter registration drives and succeeded in registering 31% of black voters in Florida, a higher percentage than in any other southern state. The white establishment resisted, firing both him and his wife Harriette in 1946 from their teaching positions as economic blackmail against them because of their activism. On Christmas night, 1951, a bomb exploded under their home, fatally injuring both of them. The murders were racially motivated and believed committed by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Four separate investigations were conducted, including the first by the FBI in 1951‚Äì1952, and the last in 2005 by the state. No one was ever prosecuted.\\"Crist Announces Results of Harry T. Moore Murder Investigation\\", 16 Aug 2006 , accessed 6 May 2008 In the late 1950s, the government opened the Long Range Proving Ground. This later became the Kennedy Space Center. This helped stimulate development in the county; where Brevard had once been considered a \\"backwoods\\" area of Florida, it attracted more educated workers and scientists associated with the program. What had once been a primarily low-tech farmer/fisherman economy was transformed into a high-tech engineering and computer economy. New residents in the 1960s found local retailing unappealing and drove to nearby Orlando to shop. Locals were concerned that the construction of malls would draw off business and lead to the disintegration of the Cocoa, Melbourne and Titusville downtowns. This did happen, but the downtown areas have been revived in the 21st century based on their historic assets and pedestrian scale. While the county was technically habitable, it was overrun by mosquitoes much of the year in the wet areas covering a great portion of its territory. Mosquitoes were controlled in 1950 by widespread use of the insecticide, DDT, which was banned in the late 20th century because of its adverse environmental effects. Reducing mosquitoes resulted in more residents being attracted to the county. When DDT became illegal, more environmentally-friendly insecticides and other mosquito-control methods were used. Beginning in the 1960s, new bridges constructed across the waterways were designed as high-rise steel, designed to be high enough to allow passage of boats underneath. In 1982, Windover Archaeological Site was discovered. As the county was long, people in the southern, more populous side of the county complained about being so distant from the county seat. The county seat of Titusville was from Palm Bay, the most populous city in the county. Residents in the southern end of the county talked of creating a new county to serve them. The county decided to build a new county administration complex at Viera, near the geographical center of the county. This complex was started in 1989. Residents in the north also threatened secession. Their proposal to form a new county, to be called Playalinda, had some momentum in the early 90s. The county made a few concessions to the people in the northern part of the county, and agreed not to officially move the county seat. Since construction of the new center, Viera has been for all intents and purposes the de facto seat of Brevard County. During the summer of 1998, some of the worst brush fires on record broke out and could not be controlled. were burned. Prior to property managers instituting controlled burns, the county forests and pastures had burned for months during the dry season. But from the 1940s to the 1970s, the state assumed control of burning in order to prevent uncontrolled fires. It also developed a policy of controlled burns based on more understanding of fire's role in the state's environment.Pyne, Florida: A Fire Survey, pp. 51-58 In 2006, the state burned a record in the county. Because of Florida's dry winters and lush vegetation, the fire threat is always high. Only California surpassed Florida in the number of fires fought by the state Forest Service, and none set so many controlled fires.Stephen J. Pyne, Florida: A Fire Survey, Series: To the Last Smoke, University of Arizona Press, 2016, pp. 15-19 =Job growth= In 2004, Brevard County ranked 13th out of 318 largest counties in the US for increase in the number of jobs. The county moved from 70 to 31 out of the top 200 metropolitan areas \\"Best Performing\\". This improvement was driven mainly by job growth. The 2004 hurricane recovery helped the area achieve high employment. In 2004, Brevard had its best October and November tourism season until then, despite widespread hurricane damage and the loss of five beachside hotels. Four of these hotels were restored by 2006. The Milken Institute ranked Brevard number one, out of 200 largest metropolitan areas, in overall job growth for 2005. Real estate data The National Association of Realtors reported in the third quarter of 2005 that existing homes prices in Brevard rose 33% annually, making it the metropolitan area in the nation (out of 147) with the sixth-highest rate of increase. There was a slight decrease in existing home prices during the last quarter of 2005. In January 2005, CNN/Money ranked the homes in \\"Palm Bay\\", perhaps referring to all of the Space Coast, as \\"49% overvalued\\", and within 10% of the most overvalued homes in the United States. In 2005, the Sunrise Bank of Cocoa Beach became the first bank in the state to have a mobile branch. In early 2005, Forbes ranked the area as 27th in job growth out of 150 metropolitan areas in the country. The county ranked 18th in the nation for mid-sized areas in 2006. Manpower Employment Outlook Survey said the hiring outlook in Brevard for the last quarter of 2005 was the 19th-best in the nation among the 470 communities participating in the survey. Nearly 44,943 new houses were built from 2000 through 2009. This was enough to house 112,000 people. However, only 60,000 people moved into the county, leaving the remaining homes vacant and helping to precipitate bursting of the United States housing bubble. In 2000, there were 198,195 households in the county and 222,072 units for an occupancy rate of 89.1%. Between 2000 and 2009, more than twice as many houses were built than were needed. Nearly 47,000 houses were built, but the number of households increased by 22,000, dropping the occupancy rate to 81.9%. In 2005, Inc. magazine voted the Space Coast as the best place to do business in Florida and sixth in the country. The county's median home price reached a high in August 2005 at $248,700.Florida Today, March 22, 2007, page 7A New home permits fell in 2007 to 1,894, the lowest since 1982. Sales of existing homes fell 19% in 2007 from the prior year to 373 monthly. The median drop in home prices was 50% from 2005 to 2008, from $248,700 to $125,200. However, when choices for smaller homes was eliminated, prices on individual homes fell 25%; down 33% for individual condos. In 2000, the median sale price of homes in Brevard was $100,000. With the collapse of the housing bubble, homes now are often about the same price, with median homes in 2009 selling for $89,400. In November 2010, the number of sales and prices of existing homes rose from the previous year. This was the first rise in 4¬Ω years. The average house sold for $87,700 in February 2011. In a separate study, a consulting firm determined that house prices in the county were 46.1% overvalued in 2005 at $212,000 average. The same firm determined that prices were 19.3% undervalued in 2008 at $129,400. The average price in December 2009, fell to a new recent low of $104,100. In January 2010, sales dropped to 434 monthly, also a recent low. The housing vacancy rate hit a high of 18.8% in 2007. The number of households renting hit a low of 48,528 in 2005. Median monthly rent hit a high of $907 in 2008. In 2009, 73% of Brevard households owned the house they lived in. The national rate was 65.9%. In 2008, a number of mortgage insurers blackmarked Brevard, along with a quarter of the total nations zip codes. This was intended to thwart potential buyers who wish to pay less than 20% down on a home. In 2009 an economist said that the Brevard housing market would not recover until at least 2011.Orlando economist Hank Fishkind. See next footnote A later analysis in 2009 seemed to agree, saying that the market would fall 41.4% to bottom out by the end of 2010. Annual foreclosures rose from a low of 1,144 in 2005 to 9,228 in 2008. From 2007 to March 2010, there were 25,600 foreclosure filings. In 2010, it was found that 1/3 or more of real estate sales were due to foreclosures. Effects of hurricanes Hurricane Matthew, which passed east of Brevard in 2016, caused about $38 million in damage. In 2017, nearly all county residents were left without power as the result of the effect of Hurricane Irma, which struck the county with tropical storm force on September 10‚Äì11, 2017. This was largely rectified by September 19. Irma resulted in $157 million in damage. Most residents were left without potable water after the storm passed, when electric power failed to maintain the necessary pressure to keep out potential contaminants, plus water main breaks, and stress on the system from the extra water from subsequent heavy rainfall. Demographics In 1966, the population was 200,700. There were 73,624 licensed drivers, 16,612 registered Republicans, 49,261 registered Democrats, 1,545 independents. There were 4,291 births, 1,018 deaths, 94,500 in the civilian labor force, and 1,800 unemployed. In 2016, the population was 561,716. There were 470,993 licensed drivers, 164,663 registered Republicans, 127,430 registered Democrats, 101,721 independents. There were 5,299 births, 6,693 deaths, 255,465 in the civilian labor force, and 12,981 unemployed. Economy In 1966, the county produced 2,880,000 boxes of oranges; in 2016, 382,000 boxes. Orange production dropped 87% from the 2008‚Äì9 season to the 2016‚Äì7 season. The decline was mostly due to canker, citrus greening disease, and hurricane damage. Unless a cure can be found for greening, the outlook is dim for improved production.

The Arab army invaded Byzantine territory and laid siege to the city in summer 707 or 708. The date is uncertain, as virtually each of the extant Greek, Arabic, and Syriac parallel sources has in this respect a different date. Tyana initially withstood the siege with success, and the Arab army faced great hardship during the ensuing winter and was on the point of abandoning the siege in spring, when a relief army sent by Emperor Justinian II arrived. Quarrels among the Byzantine generals, as well as the inexperience of a large part of their army, contributed to a crushing Umayyad victory. Thereupon the inhabitants of the city were forced to surrender. Despite the agreement of terms, the city was plundered and largely destroyed, and according to Byzantine sources its people were made captive and deported, leaving the city deserted. Background In 692/693, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II () and the Umayyad caliph Abd al- Malik () broke the truce that had existed between Byzantium and the Umayyad Caliphate since 679, following the failed Muslim attack on the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from the truce, which they extended further by exploiting the Umayyad government's involvement in the Second Muslim Civil War (680‚Äì692). However, by 692 the Umayyads were clearly emerging as the victors in the conflict, and Abd al-Malik consciously began a series of provocations to bring about a resumption of warfare. Justinian, confident in his own strength based on his previous successes, responded in kind. Finally, the Umayyads claimed that the Byzantines had broken the treaty and invaded Byzantine territory, defeating the imperial army at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 693.Haldon (1997), pp. 69‚Äì72; Howard-Johnston (2010), pp. 499‚Äì500; Lilie (1976), pp. 99‚Äì112; Stratos (1980), pp. 19‚Äì34 In its aftermath, the Arabs quickly regained control over Armenia and resumed their attacks into the border zone of eastern Asia Minor, that would culminate in the second attempt to conquer Constantinople in 716‚Äì718.Haldon (1997), pp. 72, 76, 80‚Äì83; Howard- Johnston (2010), pp. 507‚Äì510; Lilie (1976), pp. 110, 112‚Äì122 Furthermore, Justinian was deposed in 695, beginning a twenty-year period of internal instability that almost brought the Byzantine state to its knees.Lilie (1976), p. 140; Treadgold (1997), pp. 345, 346 Arab campaign against Tyana As part of these Arab raids, an invasion under a certain Maimun al-Gurgunami (\\"Maimun the Mardaite\\") took place, which raided Cilicia and was defeated by a Byzantine army under a general named Marianus near Tyana. The dating of this expedition is unclear; although the primary account, by al-Baladhuri, places it under Abd al-Malik (who died in 705), it is commonly dated to 706 by modern scholars. According to Baladhuri, this Maimun had been a slave of Caliph Muawiyah's sister, who had fled to the Mardaites, a group of Christian rebels in northern Syria. After the Mardaites had been subdued, the general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, who had heard of his valour, liberated him and entrusted him with a military command, and later swore to avenge his death.Brooks (1898), p. 203; Lilie (1976), p. 116; Stratos (1980), pp. 144‚Äì145 As a result, Maslama launched another attack aimed at Tyana, with his nephew al-Abbas ibn al-Walid as co-commander.Lilie (1976), p. 116; Mango & Scott (1997), p. 525; Stratos (1980), p. 145 The chronology of the expedition is again unclear: the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor puts it in A.M. 6201 (708/709 AD, and possibly even 709/710), but Arab sources date it to A.H. 88 and 89 (706/707 AD and 707/708 AD respectively). As a result, the siege has been variously dated to 707‚Äì708 AD and 708‚Äì709 AD.Brooks (1898), p. 192; Lilie (1976), p. 117 (Note #40); Mango & Scott (1997), p. 525; Stratos (1980), p. 147 The Arabs besieged the city, employing siege engines to bombard its fortifications. They managed to destroy part of the wall, but were unable to enter the city. Despite launching several assaults, the defenders successfully drove them back. The siege continued into winter, and the Arabs began to suffer greatly from shortage of food, so that they began contemplating abandoning the siege altogether.Lilie (1976), pp. 116‚Äì117; Mango & Scott (1997), p. 526; Stratos (1980), p. 145 In the spring, however, Justinian II, who had been restored to the Byzantine throne in 705, assembled a relief army under the generals Theodore Karteroukas and Theophylact Salibas and sent it towards Tyana. The Byzantine chroniclers record that the regular troops were complemented by armed peasants, numerous but lacking in any military experience.Lilie (1976), p. 117; Mango & Scott (1997), p. 526; Stratos (1980), pp. 145‚Äì146 Modern historians consider this an indication of the dire situation of the regular Byzantine army, partly as a result of Justinian's purge of the officer corps after his restoration, and partly due to the losses suffered in the war with the Bulgars.Lilie (1976), p. 117 (Note #41) As the relief army approached Tyana, it was confronted by the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege.Lilie (1976), p. 117; Mango & Scott (1997), p. 526; Stratos (1980), p. 146 The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised to allow them to depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May‚ÄìJune according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, the Arabs razed it to the ground.Lilie (1976), p. 117; Mango & Scott (1997), p. 526; Stratos (1980), pp. 146‚Äì147 Aftermath The chroniclers report that after sacking Tyana, Abbas and Maslama divided their forces and campaigned in Byzantine territory. Again the chronology, as well as the identity of the targets, is uncertain. The primary sources give 709 or 710 as the dates, which could mean that these raids happened in the immediate aftermath of Tyana or in the year after. Abbas raided Cilicia and from there turned west as far as Dorylaion, while Maslama seized the fortresses of Kamouliana and Heraclea Cybistra near Tyana, or, according to another interpretation of the Arabic sources, marched also west and took Heraclea Pontica and Nicomedia, while some of his troops raided Chrysopolis across from Constantinople itself.Lilie (1976), p. 118; Mango & Scott (1997), p. 526; Stratos (1980), pp. 147‚Äì148 Arab raids continued for the next years, and were carried out even while a huge army under Maslama was besieging Constantinople in 717‚Äì718. After the failure of this undertaking, Arab attacks continued, but they were now concerned with plunder and prestige, rather than outright conquest. Although the Umayyad attacks of the early 8th century were successful in gaining control of the border districts of Cilicia and the region around Melitene, and despite their destruction of Byzantine strongholds like Tyana in the following decades, the Arabs were never able to permanently establish a presence west of the Taurus Mountains, which thus came to delineate the Arab-Byzantine frontier for the next two centuries.Lilie (1976), pp. 139‚Äì142, 187‚Äì190 References Sources  * * External links * Category:700s conflicts Category:700s in the Byzantine Empire Tyana Tyana Tyana Tyana Category:707 Category:708 Category:709 Category:700s in the Umayyad Caliphate Category:Byzantine Cappadocia ","title":"Siege of Tyana"},{"id":"34508122","text":"Kaui Hart Hemmings is an American writer who was born and raised in Hawaii.

College Wilson received a BA degree in Telecommunications from the University of Southern California in 1955.UCLA Oral History Project ‚Äì Interview of Burt Wilson : oral history transcript, Dec. 5, 2005 While at USC, Wilson served as the writer and announcer for the pre-game and halftime activities, in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, for the Spirit of Troy, the USC Trojan Marching Band, under the direction of Tommy Walker. On October 30, 1954, Wilson was involved in an accident where a steel tower collapsed at USC's Bovard Field during a morning rehearsal for Band Day featuring a musical tribute on the 100th birthday of Bandmaster John Philip Sousa. There were about 20 people on the platform. Wilson was taken to the Georgia Street Hospital with injuries to his head, abdomen, and legs. After receiving treatment, Wilson asked the police to drive him to the USC-Oregon State game, at the coliseum, where he announced the pre-game and half-time band activities from memory. In his Junior year, Wilson produced the annual inter-fraternity variety show \\"Trolios\\" which was staged at the huge Shrine Auditorium, near the USC campus. In his Senior year, Wilson wrote and staged his fraternity's (Theta Chi) Trolios entry, \\"Social Probation Blues\\" which won third place in the show. 25 fraternities had entered. Wilson was also a founding member of Tau Alpha Sigma (TAS), USC's professional communications fraternity. Career and Public Service =Army= Wilson served in the U.S. Army, in Germany, as a radio announcer and soldier show producer from 1955 to 1958. While he was with Special Services, he produced the Broadway musical, Kiss Me, Kate, and toured it to many army bases around Europe. Wilson was cast as a captain in the Citizen Soldier TV Series' episode, \\"The Defense of St. Vith\\", produced by Charles Marquis Warren, who would later go on to produce the well known Rawhide TV series.The Classic TV Archive, US Military Series, Citizen Soldier, 1956‚Äì57 Wilson also served as army talent scout for producer Warren, supplying actors for the Citizen Soldier series. One of Wilson's \\"finds\\" was John Erwin who did five leads in the series and later starred as Teddy on Rawhide. Erwin would later become famous as the voice of Morris the Cat, as well as the voice of various cartoon characters, and starring in movie roles. =Advertising= Wilson's advertising career runs concurrently with his public service projects. After his return from Germany, Wilson worked as a commercial copywriter at KXOA radio and commercial writer/producer at KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California. He then launched his own advertising agency, MediaScope Advertising, Ltd. Among his many clients was Shakey's Pizza Parlors, where he formed his lifelong friendship with its co-founder, Sherwood \\"Shakey\\" Johnson and led to his eventual authoring of the book Shakey and Me. In 1965, wanting the \\"Los Angeles experience\\", Wilson moved South and went to work for Boylhart, Lovett and Dean as an account executive. In 1968, Wilson was nominated as \\"Advertising Man of the Year\\" by the Western States Advertising Association because of his volunteerism in Watts after the riots. He was beat out by H. R. \\"Bob\\" Haldeman who later became Chief of Staff for President Richard Nixon and was later sent to jail because of his involvement in Watergate. In 1969, Wilson made the leap to Creative Director at Needham, Harper, and Steers, a national agency. From NH&S;, Wilson moved to the Goodman Organization, an entertainment agency. This provided him with an entr√©e to American International Pictures where he worked freelance for a number of years creating their broadcast campaigns for such movies as Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster, Frogs, and Dr. Phibes Rises Again. Wilson moved to New York City in 1979 and managed an in-house ad agency for April-Marcus, a national clothing merchandiser. Wilson returned to California in 1981 to act as free media director for the Campaign against the Peripheral Canal. The canal was defeated by a 2/3 vote statewide. In 1983, Wilson was named Director of Advertising for Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays where he managed a 10-person Advertising Department. In 1989, he opened his own television production company in Simi Valley where he wrote and produced industrial videos and cable TV commercials. =Public service= In 1966, after the notorious Watts riots, Wilson formed the Watts Revitalization Corps, a non-funded, all-volunteer organization that worked with Watts Community members to improve conditions in the riot-torn area. His six years of work attracted national attention and was praised by then Senator Robert F. Kennedy as an outstanding example of volunteer community involvement. In 1968 Wilson began producing and hosting a public service radio program \\"What You Can Do For Your Country\\" on KMET-FM in Los Angeles. He used the program to attract young people to his Revitalization Corps work in Watts. Thousands of high school students came to Watts over the four-year run of the show. Wilson received a prestigious Columbia University Edwin Howard Armstrong award, also known as the \\"Major Armstrong award\\", for the program. In 1970, Wilson was asked by the Taos, New Mexico Indian Pueblo (who had heard him on the radio) to help in their struggle to gain title to their sacred Blue Lake religious lands and prevent a government take-over of this sanctuary. Wilson organized a media tour in and around Los Angeles for the tribal leadership. It was the first time the tribal leadership had left the pueblo in 5,000 years! For his successful efforts, Wilson was awarded a ceremonial blanket and made a brother of the pueblo. In 1973, Wilson worked in Coachella, California with C√©sar Ch√°vez during the Delano grape strike. Wilson helped organize farm workers and did publicity and PR for the Union, while working out of the UFW Union Hall in Coachella's grapefruit-growing area. He was a frequent guest on the local radio station and held media conferences for the press. In the mid-1970s, Wilson became a co-coordinator of the Los Angeles-based organization CAUSE (Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation) a coalition of 29 different consumer and activist groups which was successful in fighting an advance payments plan by ARCO and the Southern California Gas Company. He gained national attention when CAUSE secured a $1-billion victory and forced the gas company to make restitution to its users. Following this victory, CAUSE exposed the phone company's giving out of unlisted numbers to unapproved agencies and led the fight to keep natural gas tankers out of Los Angeles harbor. In 1977, Wilson ran for State Assemblyman from the 46th District, in Los Angeles County. He came in third in a 17-candidate race. Later that year, Wilson was overwhelmingly voted to the Los Angeles County Democratic Committee. That year he was also elected as the Southern Vice-President of the CDC, the California Democratic Council. In 1981‚Äì2, as a political campaign activist, Wilson played a major role as Media Director in the defeat of the Peripheral Canal proposition, a measure which would have diverted Northern California water South by means of the construction of a huge, cement canal that was considered to be environmentally adverse. The proposition was defeated by a 2/3 vote statewide. In 1982, after the Peripheral Canal campaign, Wilson signed on as Press Secretary to Dr. Wilson Riles' try at a fourth term as State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Riles lost. In 1984, Wilson was among 108 community activists in a successful ACLU lawsuit against the Public Disorder and Intelligence Division of the Los Angeles Police Department for illegal surveillance. The suit was successfully prosecuted and was settled by the LAPD for $1.3 million. In 1999, Wilson moved to Binghamton, New York, to work with the Citizen Action organization under the leadership of Mary Clark. While there, Wilson exposed the actions of State Senator Tom Libous (R-Binghamton) who was selling sport clothing out of his senate office and using his free senate frank to send out brochures. Wilson brought this to the attention of local media and thus forced Libous to give up this little side show shopping effort. The senate ethics committee chose not to prosecute. Since 2006, Wilson has been fighting against a plan to build twin tunnels in the Sacramento Delta which could drain and ruin the Delta. He established a blog titled the \\"Public Water New Service\\" in order to correct misconceptions the water agencies are using to influence the public. His blog is read by thousands throughout California. Along with his continuing activism, Wilson has written for the Los Angeles FREE PRESS, had Op-Ed pieces published in the LOS ANGELES TIMES, the SAN DIEGO UNION, the SACRAMENTO BEE, the SACRAMENTO NEWS AND REVIEW and a letter published in THE NEW YORKER. He has conducted activist-oriented radio talk shows on KPFK and co-hosted a TV program The Citizen Intelligencer on KVST-TV in Los Angeles. =Dixieland Jazz= Wilson has appeared as a guest artist in many Sacramento Dixieland Jazz Jubilees over the past 40 years. He plays piano, trombone, ukulele, and sings. Wilson is mentioned in the jazz musician's reference book, \\"Jazz West 1945‚Äì1985: The A-Z Guide to West Coast Jazz Music\\", authored by K. O. Eckland, for leading the first traditional Jazz Band (The Silver Dollar Jazz Band) ever to be hired to play at the very first Shakey's Pizza Parlor at 57th and J Streets in Sacramento, California, in 1955. Eckland wrote \\"This large, [Lu] Watters-type jazz band led the jazz revival in Sacramento.\\"Jazz West 1945‚Äì1985: The A-Z Guide to West Coast Jazz Music, by K. O. Eckland =Philosophy= In 1966, Wilson was introduced to the teaching of Agni Yoga through a friend. He met his guru, Ralph Harris Houston, in October of that same year and became his disciple in 1968. He credits Houston as inspiring him to fight injustice and serve the community as a consumer and political activist. In 1990, after the death of renowned American philosopher Manly Palmer Hall, a long-time friend of his guru, Wilson was invited to fulfill some of Hall's speaking engagements at the Philosophical Research Society (PRS) in Los Angeles. Wilson became a prominent lecturer on esoteric metaphysics at PRS and was elected to the board of trustees of the society the following year. =Projects= Wilson moved back to his home town of Sacramento in 2000. For the past 12 years, Wilson has written and produced a weekly television program called \\"Ancient Wisdom for the 21st Century\\" in which he covers esoteric subjects, explaining the many different tenets of the Ancient (Pre-Christian) Wisdom. His program is the most-watched program on the Access Channel in Sacramento and can be watched at 9:00 PM PST on Thursday nights at www.accesssacramento.org‚Äîclick on \\"Watch Ch. 17.\\" In 2004, Wilson's video production of \\"The Roots of Sacramento Jazz\\" was featured in the \\"A Place Called Sacramento\\" film festival. In 2005, Wilson was asked to participate in the UCLA Oral History Project concerning his consumer and political activism. In 2007, Wilson was featured nationally in the Ken Burns documentary film, The War. His role was to explain how a 10-year old viewed the war and tell of his experiences on the home front.Burt Wilson ‚Äì \\"THE WAR\\" (Ken Burns' Documentary, 2007) In 2011, another of Wilson's video productions, \\"CSI: Sacramento\\", a spoof of the TV series, was featured in the \\"A Place Called Sacramento\\" film festival. From 2011 to 2015, Wilson continued to write books and was well known for his op-ed editorials against the state water agencies' desire to once more divert more water from the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta to Southern California by building twin tunnels under the Delta.Water Grab, Sacramento News and Review, Aug 19, 2010 Wilson moved back to Binghamton, New York in 2015 to teach an Agni Yoga class there and work with Citizen Action, a volunteer organization that works for economic justice. Shortly thereafter, he finished his first novel and completed another book with an ancient wisdom religious theme. Both books are yet to be published.

It was built in the 13th century, mostly in the 1270s. History The site was initially occupied in the twelfth century by a hospice and chapel of the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of Malta, under the jurisdiction of the priory of Saint-Gilles in Provence. The thirteenth-century church formed part of a priory of the same order situated in olive groves outside the city walls of Aix. From the thirteenth century it served as a burial place for the Counts of Provence. In the 17th century the parish was incorporated within the city of Aix when the ramparts were extended to the south and the adjoining lands of the priory sold off to help create the quartier Mazarin. In the aftermath of the French revolution most of the internal furnishings, treasures and statuary of the church were removed or plundered and the church itself converted into a military storehouse. In the 19th century it was eventually restored to religious use as a parish church. The church is currently under the ministry of a brotherhood of apostolic monks. The nineteenth century organ in Saint-Jean-de-Malte was replaced in 2006 by a baroque-style organ built by Daniel Kern. The interior of the church may be seen in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1995 film Beyond the Clouds. Windows and stained glass Interior of Saint-Jean-de-Malte The reopening in 1858 of the large window in the apse, blocked by Jean-Claude Viany for the installation of a large altarpiece in the seventeenth century, revealed traces of polychrome stained glass indicating that in the seventeenth century the church not only had monochrome grisailles but also coloured windows, with at least some of them depicting Saint-Jean-de-Malte himself. The windows in the church today date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The new window in the apse was completed in 1858 and was designed by several artists from Aix. In the upper quatrefoils are God the Father, crowned with a globe in his left hand as he delivers a blessing with his right hand. He is flanked by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence and Beatrice of Provence. In three smaller quatrefoils below are three knights hospitaller of Malta: Berenger Monachi (l.), Gerard Thom (c., founder of the order) and H√©lion de Villeneuve (r.). The three pairs of windows below represent scenes from the life of John the Baptist: his meeting with the Virgin Mary; the baptism of Christ; and with Christ in a diptych. In the six panels below are Old Testament figures (from l. to r.): Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel. At the base of the window are six thirteenth century coats of arms connected with the Order, including those of Provence, Malta, Aragon and Aix. Other notable windows include the large rose window above the entrance to the church installed in 1896: the original rose window was blocked by Viany in the seventeenth century to make room for an organ. In 1984 an abstract window by Henri Gu√©rin was installed in the southern transept. Its coloured blocks were designed to take advantage of the changing quality of sunlight at different times of day and liturgical season. Paintings Although in the seventeenth century the prior Jean-Claude Viany commissioned paintings from Gilles Garcin and sculpture from Christophe Veyrier and his nephew Thomas, some of which can be still be seen in the church, the lack of funds when the parish was re-established after the French revolution limited the further acquisition of paintings. A number of paintings, however, have come from disestablished churches or have been donated privately, including most recently the Crucifixion by Delacroix. *St Henry pleading with the Virgin for the souls in purgatory (1687), Jean Armelin :Commissioned for the Chapel of the Souls in Purgatory in Saint-Jean-de-Malte, it was the gift of Henry de Simiane de Lacoste, a knight of Malta, who is depicted as the donor. *The Annunciation and Death of the Virgin (1678), Andr√© Boisson :These are two of a series of six paintings of scenes from the life of the Virgin, commissioned for the chapel of the former Palace of the Counts of Provence.

He was active in Aix between 1612 and 1634. This painting was probably originally in a Franciscan chapel in Aix. *St Bruno at the feet of the Virgin (1663), Reynaud Levieux :Levieux was born in Nimes; he worked in Aix between 1663 and 1670. This painting, sometimes considered his best work, was part of the main altarpiece of a Carthusian chapel in Aix before the revolution. *The Descent from the Cross (1611), Martin Guillaume :A copy of a well-known Descent by Federico Barocci, this painting was originally in the chapel of the Black Friars (P√©nitents Noirs) in Aix. It was purchased for the church in 1771 by Joseph-F√©lix Alph√©ran, who subsequently became prior of Saint-Jean-de-Malte. *Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Nicolas Mignard (1606-1668) :This painting by the Avignon-based artist Nicolas Mignard, elder brother of the court portraitist Pierre Mignard, was originally in the Carmelite chapel of the fourteenth century √âglise des Grandes-Carmes, formerly one of the main churches in Aix and burial place of Ren√© of Anjou's entrails. Following the destruction of the Grandes-Carmes during the revolution, the painting was moved to the Church of Saint-Esprit on rue Espariat and then to Saint-Jean-de- Malte. *Christ on the Cross with the Virgin and St John, The Judgement of Solomon and The woman taken in adultery (1673), Nicolas Pinson :These three paintings come from the main parliamentary chamber in the former Palace of the Counts of Provence. *The Apotheosis of St Augustin, Michel Serre (1658-1733) :Born in Catalonia, Serre lived in Marseille from the age of 17. He became a prolific painter as well as a designer for the royal fleet. During the plague of 1720, he showed great devotion to those afflicted and distributed his fortune to the poor, later to die a pauper himself. This painting was originally in the Augustinian chapel off rue Espariat. *The risen Christ appearing to St Thomas (1614), Jacques Macadr√© :This painting was originally commissioned for the √âglise des Grandes-Carmes by Alexandre de Michaelis, a squire in Aix.Official record of painting, French government website *St Roch, St Antony and St Sebastian, anonymous :This fourteenth century Florentine triptych is a recent acquisition. *The Apotheosis of St John of God, Jean- Baptiste Jouvenet :This early eighteenth-century painting of the Portuguese saint was recently restored by the art historian Marie-Christine Gloton.The restored painting is reproduced as the cover illustration of . *The Crucifixion (1820), Eug√®ne Delacroix, donated in 1998 :This early painting by Delacroix is based on a Crucifixion by Anthony van Dyck.

Established in 1992, the Archives are located in Washington, D.C., United States, and are maintained by Smithsonian Gardens, a unit of the Smithsonian Institution. As a research center, the Archives of American Gardens houses around 80,000 photographic images and records which pertain to over 6,350 gardens throughout the United States. Photographs and images date from the 1870s to the present and showcase garden features such as fountains, sculptures, fences and gates, parterres, and garden structures. The Archives also documents garden styles, such as large Italianate estates, herb and rose gardens, cottage and patio gardens, xeriscapes, and community gardens. Mission Collection The AAG maintains photographs, images, drawings, written documentation, business files, garden plans and related material, of over 6,350 gardens in the United States. It also collects documentation related to landscape architects, including the collections of Thomas Warren Sears, Robert M. Fletcher, and Perry Wheeler. The Garden Club of America Collection, which was donated in 1992, includes documentation of landscape architects such as Marian Coffin, Lawrence Halprin, Beatrix Farrand, Hare & Hare, Gertrude Jekyll, Umberto Innocenti, Jens Jensen, Charles Platt, Ellen Biddle Shipman, and Fletcher Steele. Also present are the collections of J. Horace McFarland, Katharine Lane Weems's estate, The Chimneys, postcard collections, and documentation about the Smithsonian's own gardens. The Archives has a collection of over 37,000 35mm slides of gardens, and a collection of over 3,000 hand-colored glass lantern slides from the 1920s and 1930s. The lantern slides had been created by Garden Club of America members in the early 20th century for use in lectures and presentations, and are a valuable record of hundreds of early 20th century American gardens. They had been stored in the offices of the GCA and were nearly disposed of and lost in the 1960s, before GCA Bulletin photographic editor Harriet Jackson Phelps realised their historical value. After many failed attempts to get them housed in museums or institutions at the time, they were divided and stored by members until the Archives agreed to house them. Much of their importance lies in the documenting of many gardens that no longer exist or have fallen into disrepair. Other gardens, such as the Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, have gone through several incarnations, and important information on early plantings has been preserved. Local garden clubs affiliated with the Garden Club of America, such as the Litchfield Garden Club in Litchfield County, Connecticut, are documenting their local gardens and submitting to the archives. In order to encourage the study of garden history and garden design and aid in cataloguing The Garden Club of America Collection at the Archives, the Garden Club of America has a scholarship program for undergraduate and graduate students to intern at the Archives of American Gardens. \\"Community of Gardens\\" is a website and a free mobile app where people can view some of the digital archives of AAG, and share their own personal stories, photos, video and audio of gardens around the world.

The test is based on the method proposed by Rolla Edward Park for estimating linear regression parameters in the presence of heteroscedastic error terms. Background In regression analysis, heteroscedasticity refers to unequal variances of the random error terms \\\\epsilon_i, such that :\\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\epsilon_i)=E(\\\\epsilon_i^2)-E(\\\\epsilon_i)^2=E(\\\\epsilon_i^2)=\\\\sigma_i^2. It is assumed that \\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\epsilon_i)=0. The above variance varies with i, or the i^{th} trial in an experiment or the i^{th}case or observation in a dataset. Equivalently, heteroscedasticity refers to unequal conditional variances in the response variables Y_i, such that :\\\\operatorname{Var}(Y_iX_i)=\\\\sigma_i^2, again a value that depends on i ‚Äì or, more specifically, a value that is conditional on the values of one or more of the regressors X. Homoscedasticity, one of the basic Gauss‚ÄìMarkov assumptions of ordinary least squares linear regression modeling, refers to equal variance in the random error terms regardless of the trial or observation, such that :\\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\epsilon_i)=\\\\sigma^2, a constant. =Test description= Park, on noting a standard recommendation of assuming proportionality between error term variance and the square of the regressor, suggested instead that analysts 'assume a structure for the variance of the error term' and suggested one such structure: :\\\\operatorname{ln}(\\\\sigma_{\\\\epsilon i}^2)=\\\\operatorname{ln}(\\\\sigma^2)=\\\\gamma\\\\operatorname{ln}(X_i)+v_i in which the error terms v_i are considered well behaved. This relationship is used as the basis for this test. The modeler first runs the unadjusted regression :Y_i=\\\\beta_0+\\\\beta_1X_{i1}+...+\\\\beta_{p-1}X_{i,p-1}+\\\\epsilon_i where the latter contains p ‚àí 1 regressors, and then squares and takes the natural logarithm of each of the residuals (\\\\hat{\\\\epsilon_i}), which serve as estimators of the \\\\epsilon_i. The squared residuals \\\\hat{\\\\epsilon_i}^2 in turn estimate \\\\sigma_{\\\\epsilon i}^2. If, then, in a regression of \\\\ln{(\\\\epsilon_i^2)} on the natural logarithm of one or more of the regressors X_i, we arrive at statistical significance for non-zero values on one or more of the \\\\hat\\\\gamma_i, we reveal a connection between the residuals and the regressors. We reject the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity and conclude that heteroscedasticity is present. Notes The test has been discussed in econometrics textbooks. Stephen Goldfeld and Richard E. Quandt raise concerns about the assumed structure, cautioning that the vi may be heteroscedastic and otherwise violate assumptions of ordinary least squares regression.Goldfeld, Stephen M.; Quandt, Richard E.

Along with the remains of the city walls, it covers a surface of three hectares. It is nicknamed the \\"second castle of Anjou\\" because of its size, which is just less that of the castle of Angers. It belongs to the Breton march, facing the Breton castle of Ch√¢teaubriant. Situated in a location which was fortified in the 11th century, the castle was built between the 12th and 15th centuries. Besieged several times during the Hundred Years' War, it became a strategic fortress at the end of the 15th century, during the Mad War. Ruined during the 16th century and completely abandoned since the 18th, it was saved from destruction when Louis Bessi√®re, a inhabitant of Pouanc√©, decided to restore the building in the 1960s. The castle is now owned by the town of Pouanc√© and is open to visitors during the summer months. The castle has been listed as a monument historique since 7 July 1926. Despite volunteers and amateur excavations over 40 years, little is known about the structure of the castle, due to a lack of deep archaeological surveys. History =The early history of the castle= At the end of the early middle ages, the town of Pouanc√©, at the boundaries of the Breton march and the province of Anjou, was most likely fortified to oppose the Breton castle at Ch√¢teaubriant. The first mention of the castle dates back to 1049-1060, inside the cartulary of Carbay, which recounts the count of Anjou maintained troops and a vicarius named Landri or Landry. Fragments of Merovingian sarcophagus were found in the walls of the nearby church at Saint-Aubin, proving the existence of a human settlement in Pouanc√© before the construction of the castle.Peuplement, pouvoir et paysage sur la marche Anjou-Bretagne, Jean-Claude Meuret ; soci√©t√© d‚Äôarch√©ologie et d‚Äôhistoire de la Mayenne, 1993 After the death of Landri, the castle was given by the count of Anjou to a close relation of Landri, Herv√© de Martign√©, vassal of the count of Rennes. Herv√© already possessed the deed to Lourzais, a territory close to Pouanc√©. In 1066, the Duke of Brittany, Conan II took the castle, possibly with the help of Herv√©. Following Herv√©'s death, around 1084, his son Gautier Hay succeed him. Emma, Gautier's heir, married Guillaume Ist of La Guerche in around 1130, uniting the seigneury of Pouanc√©-Martign√© with La Guerche.Cornet (2000), p. 19Neau (2010), p. 31 The lords of Pouanc√© then entered a rebellion against the Plantagenet. Geoffroy Ist, the grandson of Emma, took part in the revolt of 1173‚Äì74 with other Breton lords against Henry Plantagenet. They were defeated, and their castles destroyed.Cornet (2000), p. 21 Geoffroy's son revolted against the Count of Anjou with Breton lords in 1196, and defeated the army of the seneschal of Anjou.Neau (2010), p. 33 At the beginning of the 13th century, the castle was the center of a vast seigneury located in Anjou and Brittany, consisting of the seigneuries of Pouanc√©, Martign√©, La Guerche and Segr√©. It was around this time that the actual castle was erected, with the first towers and ramparts. Guillaume III, lord of Pouanc√©, established a levee on the Verz√©e river, thus forming a lake alongside the castle, protecting the western front of the fortification, the side that faced Brittany.Neau (2010), p. 34 The 13th century saw the beginning of the decline of the Pouanc√© family.Halbert (2000), p. 25 Geoffroy II, the son of Guillaume III, died around 1244. His own son, Geoffroy III, died in 1263, leaving his daughter Jeanne the only heir. She married Jean of Beaumont. Their grandson, Jean II of Beaumont, failed to produce an heir with his first wife Isabeau of Harcourt, and subsequently married Marguerite of Poitiers. Louis of Beaumont, their only son, died in 1364 during the battle of Cocherel.Racineux (1983), p. 41 Marie Chamaillard, the granddaughter of Isabeau (the first wife of Jean II) regained the seigneury of Pouanc√©, adding it to the fiefs already owned by her husband, Pierre II of Alen√ßon. =The Hundred Years' War= Between 1371 and 1379, Pierre II built the Main Tower and the machicolation on the castle.Neau (2010), p. 47 Some towers were altered by adding spiral staircases, notably in the Saint-Antoine tower. Between the 14th and 15th centuries, the main keep and the ice-house were built. A 19th century reproduction of the castle of Pouanc√©. The castle was attacked by a Breton army led by John V, Duke of Brittany in 1379. The castle may have been taken by betrayal.Cornet (2000), p. 17 Pierre II then exchanged the seigneury with Bertrand du Guesclin for lands in Normandy. John V gave the fortress back to Bertrand's brother Olivier du Guesclin in 1381. Olivier sold back Pouanc√© to John V in 1389. When John V married his daughter Marie to Jean I, Duke of Alen√ßon, Jean I was given the seigneury of Pouanc√© as her dowry.Racineux (1983), p. 49-50 The son of Jean I, Jean II of Alen√ßon, was captured by the English during the battle of Verneuil. After his release, financially ruined by the ransom, he decided to put pressure on his uncle John VI, Duke of Brittany to pay the remaining part of his mother's dowry.Odolant-Desnos (1787), p. 35 He kidnapped Jean of Malestroit, Bishop of Nantes and Chancellor of Brittany, to force the Duke of Brittany to pay. Refusing to be blackmailed, John VI gathered his army and launched a siege of the castle on January 6, 1432. The castle of Pouanc√© was besieged for 5 weeks by 6000 men of the Duke's army and his English allies, and bombed by 7 cannons.Racineux 1983, p.54 After 5 weeks under siege, despite the ongoing resistance of the castle, Jean II decided to negotiate and the siege was lifted on February 19.Revue de l'Anjou et de Maine et Loire, tome 2, 1853, p. 372 Eleven years after this siege, in 1443, an English army, led by John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, besieged the castle. Despite a warning from Arthur III of Brittany, Jean II of Alen√ßon counter-attacked with his men without waiting for reinforcements. His army was surprised by the English at night, and the counter-attack failed. The castle and the town managed to resist the 7000 men strong army of the English who lifted the siege after two or three weeks, leaving the faubourgs of the town destroyed.Racineux (1983), p. 59-60 =The Breton War= In 1467, Jean II of Alen√ßon plotted with Francis II, Duke of Brittany against the King of France, Louis XI of France. The Breton army attacked in October 1467Cintr√© (1992), p. 140 and besieged the castle, which was defended by Sir de Villier in the name of the King of France, without Jean's consent. After three days, the castle was taken and the Breton army looted and sacked the town, burning the town and the castle.Odolant-Desnos (1787), p. 153 In July 1468, a French counter-attack drive the Breton out of Pouanc√©. Following this, the Angevin fortress became an essential part of the French system of defense and attack against Brittany. In 1472, Louis XI spent time in the fortress with more than 5,000 men when he learn Breton troops were gathering in La Guerche.Racineux (1983), p. 62 In 1488, Louis II de la Tr√©moille assembled 12,000 men in Pouanc√© before launching the siege of Ch√¢teaubriant, starting a military campaign against Brittany that defeated the independent duchy. =Wars of Religion= In 1562, the seigneury fell into the hands of the Coss√©-Brissac family, more precisely to Charles II de Coss√©, Duke of Brissac. A fervent catholic, he entered the Catholic League in 1590 and opposed the King of France Henry IV. In 1592, Madam of Brissac sent Chanjus, commander of Pouanc√©'s castle, to pay homage to the King in Angers.Racineux (1983), p. 67 Despite a desire for neutrality, the town and the castle were occupied in 1593 by 50 soldiers of Charles, Duke of Mayenne, a member of the Catholic League. He joined the King in 1596, but Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc≈ìur, Governor of Brittany, continued the combat. In September 1597, Chanjus, commander of Pouanc√©, handed over the castle to Merc≈ìur who is believed to have established a garrison.Cornet (2000), p.24 He finally surrendered in March 1598, bringing an end to the eightieth war of religion in France. =Abandonment of the castle= Inside of the fortress, pre-1916. Dwellings and workshops are visible along the ramparts. On the right: the Mill Tower before its collapse in 1915. On the left, the Custodial Tower, which collapsed in 1936. For a long time, the castle lost its residential function, with only the family of Coss√©-Brissac using it on rare occasions. However, Fran√ßois de Coss√© died in the castle in 1651 and his body was buried within the grounds.Cornet (2000) ,p.62 During the 17th and the 18th centuries, some rooms were still inhabitable, since several people were mentioned as residing inside: a gardener in 1620, a lieutenant of bailliage died there in 1671, and an officer dwelled there between 1756 and 1767.Cornet (2000), p.63 A tax office was situated in a lower room of the castle at the beginning of the 17th century.Halbert (2000), p.180 However, many of the officers in charge of the administration of the seigneury were living outside of the walled city of Pouanc√©, inside their own residences.Halbert (2000), p.181 As early as 1541, the ancient ramparts were partially in disrepair and largely abandoned. During the 18th century, inhabitants of Pouanc√© were allowed to use the stone for their houses if they owned them.Neau (2010) During the second half of the 18th century, inhabitants of the town decided to partially deconstruct the gatehouse, as well as fill in the moat and build several dwellings and workshops inside the bailey, along the curtain wall, thus commencing a long period of degradation. Yet during the archaeological congress of France in 1871 in Angers, the fortress was judged to be \\"a beautiful feudal ruin, one of the most beautiful doubtlessly possessed by Anjou\\".Galicca.bnf.fr Congr√®s arch√©ologique de France, 38e sessions, juin 1871 In 1880, in a speech given during the graduation ceremony at an Angers lyc√©e, Paul Lehugeur mentioned the castle of Pouanc√©: \\"All corners of Anjou have feudal ruins, but it is to Pouanc√© we look for its great fortress, with its double wall and powerful defenses\\".Paul Lehugeur, Excursions historiques en Anjou, discours prononc√© √† la distribution des prix du lyc√©e d'Angers, 1880 Read online In 1911, a Catholic private school, the Christ Child School, was built between the bastion and the northern postern. The upper part of the northern curtain wall was destroyed. In 1915, one of the towers, the Mill Tower, collapsed along with a part of the curtain wall, opening a breach into the outside walls which were formerly preserved. The castle was listed as a Monument historique in 1926. In 1929, the inspector- general of historical monuments carried out a plan of the ruins, in order to \\"at least preserve the memory\\" of the castle. After surveys showed the risk of collapse, the Marquis of Montault, owner of the castle, evacuated the remaining residents.G√©han (1992), p.41 In 1934, the Beaux-arts destroyed the now abandoned houses inside the bailey.G√©han (1992), p.42 The upper part of a second tower, the Criminal tower, collapsed in 1936. The top of the remaining towers and ramparts were restored to prevent further degradation.

Design and development The Aristocraft II was a redesigned aircraft built off the prototype airframe of the WACO Aristocraft. The Franklin-powered Aristocraft pusher was rebuilt using the wings and most of the internal structure of the original. The layout was drastically changed from a twin-tailed, mid-engined, pusher to a conventional tractor arrangement. The intent was to develop a homebuilt aircraft from the design with the flexibility to carry six passengers, or fewer people with extended range. An effort was made to certify the design, under the name Model W Winner but money ran out before completion, with only two orders. The Aristocraft II was a strut-braced, high-wing, tricycle gear, six-passenger aircraft designed for Franklin or Lycoming engines. The fuselage was made of welded steel tubing with aluminum skin. The cowling was split vertically, and could hinge open for maintenance. Variants The standard engine was a six-cylinder Lycoming, however plans were drawn for a Jacobs L-4MB radial engine installation and also for a Continental R-670 radial installation.

Biography Cooper was born in Greenwich and studied and for a short while practised medicine. Finding the life of general practitioner stressful and tiring, he turned instead to chemistry, to which he applied himself with zeal. Until 1842 he lectured in chemistry at a number of establishments, including the Russell Institution, the Aldersgate School of Medicine, and the Webb Street School of Anatomy and Medicine in Southwark. Cooper acted as a manufacturer and supplier of chemicals - \\"at one time the sole supplier of iodine in Britain\\" according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. He devised or collaborated to produce a number of tools and techniques for which he won repute, including a hydrometer, an oxy-hydrogen microscope (the gasses providing a bright light- source), a baroscope, a refractometer; improvements in electroplating, electric cell design, and microscope mountings. He was employed as a chemical analyst and appeared at court as an expert witness on a number of occasions. He provided expert services to a Royal Society and Board of Longitude initiative to improve the optical qualities of glass; and testimonials of the purity of a new line of brandy to its manufacturers for use in its advertising. He discovered iodoform but did not publish, that honour falling to Georges-Simon Serullas. Cooper was vice-president of the London Chemical Society during its short incarnation. One of Cooper's students, Robert Warington founded the Chemical Society of London, and Cooper was an \\"energetic early Fellow\\". Cooper's name and excellent reputation is not entirely free from controversy, however. He is implicated in the support of a patent for the use of hyposulphite of soda to fix daguerreotype images, despite clear indications that he was aware of prior art demonstrated and published by Sir John Herschel.

Life Maria Alekseyevna was born in Moscow and was named in honor of her mother, Maria Miloslavskaya. Maria Alekseyevna did not actively participate in the political plots of the Kremlin, but her open passive sympathy for Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna, Eudoxia Lopukhina and Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia made her relationship to Tsar Peter tense. She maintained a contact with Eudoxia Lopukhina after Lopukhina had been placed in a convent, and passed messages and money between Lopukhina and her son Alexei Petrovich. When Alexei Petrovich left Russia, she met him on the way and brought a letter from him to his mother. After the arrest of Alexei, Maria was taken in custody accused of having assisted his escape. She was imprisoned, first in prison and then in house arrest in Saint Petersburg. She was released in 1721. Maria Alexeyevna outlived all of her sisters and died in 1723, two years before the death of her brother. She was buried in the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg.

Using the pumped-storage hydroelectric method, the power plant has an installed capacity of . To accomplish power generation, the power station shifts water between two reservoirs, the lower Asahi Reservoir and the upper Seto Reservoir. Construction on both the Asahi and Seto Dams began in 1971 and was complete in 1978. The power station was commissioned in 1980. Due to heavy sediment and turbidity in the Seto Reservoir, caused by logging and landslides upstream, a sediment bypass tunnel was constructed between 1992 and 1998. Design and operation Intake and outflow structure for the power station, located on the northern edge of Asahi Reservoir =Asahi Dam= The lower reservoir is created by the Asahi Dam which is a tall and long arch dam on the Asahi River of the Shingu River system. Its catchment area covers an area of and the surface of the reservoir covers . The lower reservoir's storage capacity is of which is active (or usable) for pumping up to the lower reservoir. =Seto Dam= Creating the upper reservoir in a valley above the lower is the Seto Dam. It is a tall and long rock-fill embankment dam with of fill. Its catchment area covers a much smaller area of and its surface covers . The upper reservoir has a storage capacity of of which is useful for power generation down at the power station. During periods of low demand when electricity is cheap, the power station pumps water from the lower reservoir to the upper. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the power station through the same tunnels to generate electricity. Additionally, the six Francis pump-turbine-generators are reversible and serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The pumping and generation process is repeated as needed and although the power station consumes more electricity pumping than it does generating, pumping occurs when electricity is cheap and generating when it is expensive; making the power station economical. The difference in elevation between the two reservoirs affords a hydraulic head of . =Sediment bypass tunnel= To allow sediment to pass the lower Seto Reservoir, a bypass tunnel was constructed. The tunnel itself is hood-shaped and long. It passes through rock on the north side of the reservoir. The intake for the tunnel is controlled by a tall and long weir located upstream of the dam. The weir is used to divert sediment- laden river water into the tunnel or to let it flow into the reservoir. The tunnel can divert a maximum of of water and discharges downstream of the Seto Dam.

Left unclear, however, is whether a state's legislature which has applied to Congress for such a convention may later change its sentiment and rescind such application. If the purpose of Article V is to give state legislators power over a recalcitrant Congress--and if state lawmakers may indeed limit their applications by specific subject matter--it is possible that, if the question were ever put before them, federal courts would hold that a rescission of a previous application is likewise valid, in order to give more meaningful effect to the power which Article V confers upon state legislators. Recent activities The legislatures of some states which, at various times, have made application to Congress for the calling of an Article V amendatory convention, have later rescinded such petitions. During the period between 1988 and 2019, it is known that lawmakers in 22 states adopted legislation to rescind previous legislative measures to apply for such a convention. Perhaps there were others in addition to the 22 which are confirmed. Remaining unclear from the language of Article V--and subject to debate--is whether an application, once made by a state legislature, may be subsequently revoked by that state's legislature. From 2008 to 2019 in 12 of those very same 22 states, lawmakers changed their minds yet again--back in the direction of favoring that an Article V amendatory convention in fact be called. List of state legislative rescissions (1988‚Äì2019) What follows is a listing of states whose legislatures are confirmed to have approved resolutions and memorials rescinding previous resolutions and memorials applying for an Article V amendatory convention. These known 22 rescissions have been officially received by at least one of the two houses of Congress and were, at a minimum, summarized in the Congressional Record and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in either house of Congress. Again, the list below, covering 1988 to present, might not be all-inclusive: *Alabama rescinding in 1988 (both House Joint Resolution No. 26 [POM-311, Volume 135 Congressional Record, page 20052 and POM-434, Volume 136 Congressional Record, page 4663] as well as House Joint Resolution No. 182 [POM-433, Volume 136 Congressional Record, page 4663]); but in 2011, Alabama legislators approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 100, reprising Alabama's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution --thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Alabama's 1975 and 1976 applications for the same thing had been repealed by Alabama's two rescissions in 1988; and in 2015, Alabama lawmakers further applied for a convention relative to fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limiting the terms of office of federal officials--including members of Congress (House Joint Resolution No. 112); *Florida rescinding in 1988 (Senate Memorial No. 302 [POM-549, Volume 134 Congressional Record, page 15363]); but in 2010, Florida legislators approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10, reprising Florida's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Florida's 1976 application for the same thing had been repealed by Florida's 1988 rescission; four years later in 2014, Florida lawmakers again applied for a convention relative to an amendment requiring that the federal budget be balanced (Senate Memorial No. 658); not stopping there, 2014 Florida legislators also applied for a convention relative to amendments that would place fiscal restraints upon the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office of federal officials--including members of Congress (Senate Memorial No. 476); as well as applying, likewise in 2014, for a convention for an amendment to require that legislation in Congress contain only one subject and that the one subject must be clearly expressed in the measure's title (House Memorial No. 261); and in 2016, Florida lawmakers further applied for a convention relative to term limits on Members of Congress (House Memorial No. 417); *Nevada Assembly members attempted a structurally-flawed, one-house rescission in 1989 with their adoption of Assembly Resolution No. 20 (\\"FILE NUMBER 157\\") [POM-181, Volume 135 Congressional Record, page 14573] issuing the unusual instruction to the Nevada Assembly's Chief Clerk to \\"...draw a black border around the portion of the 1979 Assembly Journal whereby the Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution No. 8 and write across the face thereof: 'Expunged by order of the Assembly this 24th day of June, 1989...'\\"; but, in 2017, Nevada lawmakers succeeded in a proper, two-house, umbrella-style rescission with their adoption of Senate Joint Resolution No. 10 (see below); *Louisiana rescinding in 1990 (House Concurrent Resolution No. 218 [POM-288, Volume 138 Congressional Record, page 669]); but in 2008, Louisiana lawmakers again applied for a convention--to place into the Constitution the statutory Posse Comitatus Act originally enacted by Congress in 1878 (House Concurrent Resolution No. 38); and a separate entreat three years later, in 2011, for a convention relative to an amendment requiring that a majority of state legislatures approve any increase in the federal government's debt (House Concurrent Resolution No. 87); and three years after that, in 2014, Louisiana legislators approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 70, reprising Louisiana's plural applications for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Louisiana's plural applications during the 1970s for the same thing had been among the casualties of Louisiana's umbrella-rescission in 1990; most recently, in 2016, the Louisiana Legislature applied for a convention \\"...for the purpose of proposing amendments to limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, impose fiscal restraints upon its activities, and limit the terms of office that may be served by its officials and by members of Congress\\" (Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 52); *Idaho rescinding in 1999 (Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 129 [POM-410, Volume 146 Congressional Record, pages 1449‚Äì1450]); *Oregon rescinding in 1999 (Senate Joint Memorial No. 9 [POM-393, Volume 146 Congressional Record, page 95]); *North Dakota rescinding in 2001 (Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4028 [POM-8, Volume 147 Congressional Record, page 5905]); but a decade later, in 2011, North Dakota lawmakers submitted to Congress two applications‚Äîone asking for a convention relative to an amendment requiring that a majority of the state legislatures approve any increase in the federal government's debt (Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4007); and a separate request for a convention relative to an amendment which would negate concerns about a \\"runaway\\" Article V Convention (House Concurrent Resolution No. 3048); in 2013, during North Dakota's 63rd Legislative Assembly, Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4016 was offered (\\"A concurrent resolution to rescind an application made by the Sixty‚Äësecond Legislative Assembly to the Congress of the United States to call a convention pursuant to the terms of Article V of the United States Constitution for proposing an amendment to the Constitution\\") which--had it passed--would have rescinded the aforementioned House Concurrent Resolution No. 3048 from 2011; on February 27, 2013, S.C.R. No. 4016 \\"was declared lost\\" on a voice vote; and in 2015, North Dakota legislators approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 3015, reprising North Dakota's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after North Dakota's 1975 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of North Dakota's umbrella-rescission in 2001; and in 2017, North Dakota lawmakers approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 3006, applying for a convention for an amendment that would place fiscal restraints upon the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office of federal officials, including members of Congress; *Utah rescinding in 2001 (House Joint Resolution No. 15 [POM-197, Volume 147 Congressional Record, page 19025]); but in 2015, Utah lawmakers approved House Joint Resolution No. 7, reprising Utah's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Utah's 1979 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of Utah's umbrella-rescission in 2001; *Arizona rescinding in 2003 (Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1022 [POM-125, Volume 149 Congressional Record, page 12844]); but in 2017, Arizona legislators approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 2013, reprising Arizona's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Arizona's 1977 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of Arizona's umbrella-rescission in 2003; and, likewise in 2017, Arizona lawmakers further applied for a convention relative to an amendment placing fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limiting the terms of office of federal officials--including members of Congress (House Concurrent Resolution No. 2010); *Georgia rescinding in 2004 (House Resolution No. 1343 [Memorial 349, Volume 150 Congressional Record, page 11124]); but in 2014, Georgia legislators approved Senate Resolution No. 371, reprising Georgia's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Georgia's 1976 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of Georgia's umbrella-rescission in 2004; and, likewise in 2014, Georgia lawmakers further applied for a convention to propose amendments that would impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office for federal officials--including members of Congress (Senate Resolution No. 736); *South Carolina rescinding in 2004 (\\"H. 3400\\" [POM-187, Volume 160 Congressional Record, page S367, soft-cover preliminary edition]) Note: It took nearly a full decade for South Carolina's 2004 rescission to officially find its way onto the pages of the Congressional Record, together with referral to committee in each body; *Virginia rescinding in 2004 (House Joint Resolution No. 194 [POM-218, Volume 160 Congressional Record, page S2238, soft-cover preliminary edition]) Note: It took a full decade for Virginia's 2004 rescission to officially find its verbatim text on the pages of the Congressional Record, together with referral to the Judiciary Committee in the United States Senate; *Montana rescinding in 2007 (House Joint Resolution No. 38 [POM-146, Volume 153 Congressional Record, page 17881]); *Oklahoma rescinding in 2009 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 11 [POM-253, Volume 160 Congressional Record, page S3667, soft-cover preliminary edition]) Note: It took five years for Oklahoma's 2009 rescission to officially find its verbatim text on the pages of the Congressional Record, together with referral to the Judiciary Committee in the United States Senate; furthermore, in 2016, Oklahoma lawmakers again applied for a convention relative to a combination of: (1) Balanced Budget Amendment; and (2) Fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limiting the terms of office of federal officials, including members of Congress (Senate Joint Resolution No. 4); thus, Oklahoma lawmakers went on record once again on the topic of a balanced budget amendment after Oklahoma's 1976 application for a balanced budget amendment had been among the casualties of Oklahoma's umbrella-rescission in 2009; *Wyoming rescinding in 2009 (Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 3, previously designated as House Joint Resolution No. 0007 [Memorial 33, Volume 155 Congressional Record, page 10426]); but in 2017, Wyoming lawmakers approved House Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 2, reprising Wyoming's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution --thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Wyoming's 1977 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of Wyoming's umbrella-rescission in 2009; *New Hampshire rescinding in 2010 (House Concurrent Resolution No. 28 [Memorial 357, Volume 156 Congressional Record, page 14480]); but in 2012, New Hampshire lawmakers approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 40, reprising New Hampshire's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after New Hampshire's 1979 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of New Hampshire's umbrella-rescission in 2010; *South Dakota rescinding in 2010 (House Bill No. 1135 [POM-252, Volume 160 Congressional Record, page S3667, soft-cover preliminary edition]) Note: It took four years for South Dakota's 2010 rescission to officially find its verbatim text on the pages of the Congressional Record, together with referral to the Judiciary Committee in the United States Senate; furthermore, in 2015, South Dakota lawmakers approved House Joint Resolution No. 1001, reprising South Dakota's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution --thus going on record once again on that specific topic after South Dakota's 1979 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of South Dakota's umbrella-rescission in 2010; *Tennessee rescinding in 2010 (House Joint Resolution No. 30 [Memorial 405 and Memorial 406, Volume 156 Congressional Record, page 19370]); but, in 2014, Tennessee legislators approved House Joint Resolution No. 548, reprising Tennessee's application for a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment to the federal Constitution--thus going on record once again on that specific topic after Tennessee's 1977 application for the same thing had been among the casualties of Tennessee's 2010 umbrella-rescission; and in 2016, Tennessee lawmakers further applied for a convention relative to fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limiting the terms of office of federal officials, including members of Congress (Senate Joint Resolution No. 67); *Delaware rescinding in 2016 (House Concurrent Resolution No. 60 [POM-200, Volume 162 Congressional Record, page S5277, soft-cover preliminary edition]); *Maryland rescinding in 2017 (both House Joint Resolution No. 2 and Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 [POM-102 as well as POM-103, Volume 163 Congressional Record, pages S5112 and S5113, soft- cover preliminary edition]); *Nevada rescinding in 2017 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 10--\\"FILE NUMBER 22\\") [POM-64, Volume 163 Congressional Record, pages S4055-S4056, soft-cover preliminary edition]; *New Mexico rescinding in 2017 (House Joint Resolution No. 10 [POM-96, POM-99 and POM-100, Volume 163 Congressional Record, pages S5110, S5111 and S5112, soft-cover preliminary edition]); *Texas rescinding in 2017 (Senate Joint Resolution No. 38) all Article V Convention applications adopted prior to the year 2017--with the singular exception of that convention application approved by Texas lawmakers during the year 1977 on the topic of a federal Balanced Budget Amendment [POM-130, Volume 163 Congressional Record, pages S6847-S6848, soft-cover preliminary edition and POM-131, Volume 163 Congressional Record, pages S6922-S6923, soft-cover preliminary edition]; and *South Dakota rescinding in 2019 (House Joint Resolution No. 1004) three prior Article V Convention applications (from years 1907, 1909 and 1971) which were overlooked in South Dakota's 2010 umbrella rescission (House Bill No. 1135), referenced above [2019 H.J.R. No. 1004 was designated as POM-45, Volume 165 Congressional Record, page S2610, soft-cover preliminary edition and as POM-56, Volume 165 Congressional Record, page S2813, soft-cover preliminary edition]. Unsuccessful efforts to rescind prior Article V Convention applications (2009‚Äì2017) From 2011 to 2017, unsuccessful measures to rescind previous convention calls were known to have been introduced in 10 states as follows: =2009= *Arkansas \\\\- House Concurrent Resolution No. 1022 (\\"to rescind the previous application by the General Assembly to the Congress of the United States that it call a Constitutional Convention to Propose an Amendment to the Constitution to balance the public debt\\") which went down to defeat in the Arkansas House of Representatives on April 3, 2009, with a record vote of 35 yeas, 52 nays and 13 not voting. =2011= *Kansas ‚Äì Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1601 (\\"rescinding the action of the legislature of the state of Kansas petitioning congress to call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to the constitution of the United States\\");

Federal Elections Commission]\\"). The Vermont Senate adopted \\"J.R.S. 17\\" on April 6, 2017; it was then referred to the Committee on Government Operations in the Vermont House of Representatives. Incomplete state legislative actions for an Article V Convention (2010‚Äì2019) =2010= During the 2010 state legislative season, there was at least one state in which it is known that Article V amendatory convention applications were approved by one chamber of that state's bicameral legislature. On June 9, 2010, the Louisiana House of Representatives approved ten concurrent resolutions requesting that Congress call separate Article V conventions on various subject matters. Aside from referring all ten of them to its Finance Committee--where they all died--the Louisiana Senate did not take further action on these concurrent resolutions: *House Concurrent Resolution No. 57 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding a presidential line item veto for appropriation bills\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 59 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding a requirement that bills be confined to a single object and a prohibition on amendments that are not germane to the bill as introduced\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 62 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding a requirement for a supermajority vote to levy a new tax, increase an existing tax, or repeal an existing tax exemption\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 63 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding term limits for members of congress\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 64 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding a limitation on the authority of congress to pass legislation pursuant to the general welfare clause in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 65 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding a requirement to reduce the federal debt through annual appropriations\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 66 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding an overall spending limitation on the federal budget\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 67 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding a limitation on the authority of congress to pass legislation pursuant to the necessary and proper clause in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution\\"); *House Concurrent Resolution No. 68 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose a balanced budget amendment\\") (refer, however, to House Concurrent Resolution No. 70, which was adopted by both chambers of the Louisiana Legislature, during its 2014 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); and *House Concurrent Resolution No. 69 (\\"Applies to congress to call a convention pursuant to Article V of the U.S. Constitution to propose an amendment regarding a limitation on the authority of congress to pass legislation pursuant to the commerce clause in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution\\"). =2011= During the 2011 state legislative season, there were at least five states in which it is known that Article V amendatory convention applications were approved by one chamber of bicameral legislatures. While there may be other examples, the known five are: *Florida whose Senate on April 28, 2011, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4 (\\"urging Congress to call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States to achieve and maintain a balanced federal budget\\"); the concurrent resolution then died in the Florida House of Representatives; but during the previous year of 2010, Florida lawmakers had already approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10 doing virtually the same thing as 2011's S.C.R. No. 4; *Kentucky whose Senate on February 22, 2011, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 134 (\\"urge Congress to call an Article V Convention for the purpose of proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States requiring a balanced federal budget\\"); the concurrent resolution then died in the Committee on Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Kentucky House of Representatives; *South Carolina whose House of Representatives on February 3, 2011, approved a Joint Resolution designated as \\"H. 3074\\" (\\"to request appropriate action by the Congress of the United States, on its own action by consent of two-thirds of both houses or on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states, to propose an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to require that the total of all federal appropriations may not exceed the total of all estimated federal revenues in any fiscal year, with certain exceptions\\"); this joint resolution then died in the Judiciary Committee of the South Carolina Senate. On February 16, 2011, South Carolina's House of Representatives likewise approved a Concurrent Resolution designated as \\"H. 3507\\" (\\"to make application to the Congress of the United States to call a constitutional convention pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution for the purpose of proposing a constitutional amendment that permits the repeal of any federal law or regulation by vote of two-thirds of the state legislatures\\"); this concurrent resolution likewise died in the Judiciary Committee of the South Carolina Senate; *Texas whose Senate on February 23, 2011, approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 1 (\\"urging the Congress of the United States to propose and submit to the states for ratification a federal balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States and, in the event that Congress does not submit such an amendment on or before December 31, 2011, applying to Congress to call a convention for the specific and exclusive purpose of proposing an amendment to that constitution to provide, in the absence of a national emergency and on a two-thirds vote of Congress, for a federal balanced budget and requesting that the legislatures of each of the several states that compose the United States apply to Congress to call a convention to propose such an amendment\\"); the joint resolution then died in the Select Committee on State Sovereignty of the Texas House of Representatives; but during their 1977 Regular Session, Texas lawmakers had already approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 31 doing virtually the same thing as 2011's S.J.R. No. 1; and *Virginia whose House of Delegates on January 25, 2011, approved House Joint Resolution No. 542 (\\"making application to the Congress of the United States to call an amendment convention pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution for the purpose of proposing a constitutional amendment that permits the repeal of any federal law or regulation by vote of two-thirds of the state legislatures\\"); H.J.R. No. 542 then died in the Committee on Privileges and Elections of the Virginia Senate. On February 23, 2011, Virginia's House of Delegates likewise approved House Joint Resolution No. 852 (\\"memorializing the Congress of the United States to adopt legislation requiring a balanced federal budget and to call a convention for the purpose of amending the Constitution to provide a balanced budget requirement\\") and H.J.R. No. 852 then died in the Committee on Rules of the Virginia Senate. =2012= During the 2012 state legislative season, it is known that in five states Article V amendatory convention applications were approved by one chamber of a bicameral legislature. While it is possible that there were others, the five known examples are: *Arizona whose Senate on February 27, 2012, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1005 (\\"applying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention for proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to provide that an increase in the Federal debt requires approval from a majority of the legislatures of the separate states\\"); the concurrent resolution then died in the Committee on Appropriations of the Arizona House of Representatives; *Georgia whose Senate on March 7, 2012, approved Senate Resolution No. 673 (\\"making renewed application to the Congress of the United States to call for a convention for the purpose of proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and for other purposes\\"); the resolution then died in the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Georgia House of Representatives (refer, however, to Senate Resolution No. 371, which was adopted by both chambers of the Georgia General Assembly, during its 2014 session, which accomplishes basically the same thing); *Hawaii whose House of Representatives on April 5, 2012, approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 114 (\\"Applying to Congress to call a National Constitutional Convention pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution\\"); the concurrent resolution then died in the Committee on Public Safety, Government Operations, and Military Affairs as well as in the Committee on Judiciary and Labor of the Hawaii Senate; had it also been approved by the Hawaii Senate, H.C.R. No. 114 would have constituted the very first time in the entire history of Hawaii statehood that Hawaii would have made application for an Article V convention; as approved by the Hawaii House of Representatives, H.C.R. No. 114 contained four suggested distinct amendments to the Federal Constitution for Article V amendatory convention delegates to consider: (1) \\"A declaration of the constitutionality of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate requiring the purchase of health insurance\\"; (2) \\"An amendment to Article I, Section 5, to prohibit the supermajority cloture requirement under Rule 22 of the United States Senate for ending floor debates and filibusters, to facilitate a more reasonable voting standard for cloture\\"; (3) \\"An amendment abolishing the electoral college established under Article II, Section 1, and providing for the direct election of the United States President and Vice President by voters\\"; and (4) \\"An amendment to Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, to require that Senate confirmations of appointments of officers of the United States be made by a simple majority vote within sixty days of the nomination\\"; *New Hampshire whose Senate on February 8, 2012, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1 (\\"urging Congress to call a convention for the sole purpose of proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States\\"); S.C.R. No. 1 was relative to altering the present means of proposing amendments to the Federal Constitution; this concurrent resolution then died in the Committee on State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs of the New Hampshire House of Representatives; and *Oklahoma whose Senate on March 12, 2012, approved Senate Bill No. 1903 (\\"An Act relating to the United States Constitution; stating legislative findings; setting forth application for amendments convention for specific purpose; limiting convention to proposal for amendment to United States Constitution to require state legislative approval for increase in federal debt; providing that application continue for certain period; and directing distribution by Secretary of State\\"); the bill then died in the Judiciary Committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Likewise during the 2012 state legislative season, there was one state in which an alleged Article V Convention so-called \\"application\\" was approved by only one chamber of a bicameral legislature. That was: *Colorado whose House of Representatives on January 19, 2012, approved House Resolution No. 12-1003 (\\"concerning an Application under Article V of the United States Constitution to the Congress of the United States to call a Convention for Proposing an Amendment to the United States Constitution to Repeal the 'Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'.\\" [Congressional Public Law No. 111-148]). Colorado's H.R. No. 12-1003, upon closer inspection, is structurally flawed inasmuch as that resolution resolves only that the \\"...House of Representatives of the Sixty-eighth General Assembly...\\" applies for an Article V Convention. Validity as an actual Article V application requires that both chambers of the bicameral Colorado General Assembly so resolve. On its face a strictly unicameral instrument, H.R. No. 12-1003 was never even transmitted to the Colorado Senate for that body's consideration. On July 18, 2012, the Colorado House of Representatives' H.R. No. 12-1003 was officially received by the United States House of Representatives, was designated by the U.S. House as Memorial No. 252, and was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in that body (See 158 Congressional Record, page H5009, soft-cover preliminary edition). =2013= During the 2013 state legislative season, Article V amendatory convention applications received the approval of one chamber of bicameral state legislatures. While it is possible that there were others, the three known examples are: *Indiana whose Senate on February 26, 2013, approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 18 (\\"requesting Congress to call a constitutional convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States concerning limitation of the commerce and taxing powers of Congress\\"); the joint resolution was then referred to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Indiana House of Representatives and died in that Committee; *Minnesota whose Senate on May 2, 2013, approved Senate File No. 17 (\\"resolution requesting Congress to propose a constitutional amendment and, if Congress does not propose an amendment, applying to Congress to call a constitutional convention to propose an amendment clarifying the rights protected under the Constitution are the rights of natural persons and not the rights of artificial entities and that spending money to influence elections is not speech under the First Amendment\\"); the resolution was then transmitted to the Minnesota House of Representatives where, supposedly, it was to be placed on the House's Calendar for May 10, 2013; but nothing happened; on March 4, 2014, S.F. No. 17 was reported from committee back to the full Minnesota House of Representatives and briefly occupied the status of \\"second reading\\"; S.F. No. 17 was then placed on the House's calendar for April 30, 2014, but, again, nothing happened; it was then placed on the House's calendar for May 15, 2014--again, nothing happened--and S.F. No. 17 was then \\"returned to General Register\\" with no further progress having occurred; and *South Carolina whose House of Representatives on April 17, 2013, approved \\"H. 3862\\" (\\"To make Application by the State of South Carolina under Article V of the United States Constitution for a Balanced Budget Amendment Convention of the several States of the United States\\"); the concurrent resolution was then referred to the Committee on Finance in the South Carolina Senate with no further progress having occurred. =2014= During the 2014 state legislative season, Article V Convention applications received the approval of one chamber of bicameral state legislatures. While it is possible that there were others, the seven known examples are: *Alabama whose House of Representatives on February 13, 2014, approved House Joint Resolution No. 49 (\\"Making Application for a Convention of the States under Article V of the United States Constitution to propose certain amendments relating to the Federal Government\\"); H.J.R. No. 49, which pertains to \\"...proposing amendments that impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office for its officials\\", was referred to the Rules Committee in the Alabama Senate where it died; (refer, however, to House Joint Resolution No. 112, which was approved by both chambers of the Alabama Legislature, during its 2015 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); and whose House of Representatives on April 2, 2014, likewise approved House Joint Resolution No. 192 (\\"Urging Congress to call a Convention for the purpose of proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\\"); H.J.R. No. 192, relative to defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman, likewise died in the Alabama Senate's Committee on Rules; *Arizona whose House of Representatives on February 25, 2014, approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 2017 (\\"Applying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention for proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to require that the Congress adopt a Balanced Federal Budget\\"); H.C.R. No. 2017 then died in the Committee on Government and Environment, in the Committee on the Judiciary, and in the Committee on Rules of the Arizona Senate (refer, however, to House Concurrent Resolution No. 2013, which was adopted by both chambers of the Arizona Legislature, during its 2017 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); and whose House of Representatives on March 12, 2014, likewise approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 2027 (\\"Applying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States\\") which called for a federal constitutional amendment to impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office for officials of the federal government; H.C.R. No. 2027 likewise died in the same three committees of the Arizona Senate (refer, however, to House Concurrent Resolution No. 2010, which was adopted by both chambers of the Arizona Legislature, during its 2017 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); *Florida whose House of Representatives on March 26, 2014, approved House Memorial No. 81 (\\"A memorial to the Congress of the United States, applying to Congress to call a convention for the sole purpose of proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that would limit the consecutive terms of office which a member of the United States Senate or the United States House of Representatives may serve\\"); the House Memorial then died in the Committee on the Judiciary of the Florida Senate; (refer, however, to House Memorial No. 417, which was adopted by both chambers of the Florida Legislature, during its 2016 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); *Georgia whose House of Representatives on February 20, 2014, approved House Resolution No. 1215 (\\"Applying for a convention of the states under Article V of the United States Constitution; and for other purposes\\"); the House Resolution was then referred to the Committee on Rules in the Georgia Senate where it died (refer, however, to Senate Resolution No. 736, which was likewise adopted by both chambers of the Georgia General Assembly in 2014, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); *Maryland whose Senate on April 7, 2014, the final day of the 2014 legislative session, approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 6 (\\"FOR the purpose of applying to the U.S. Congress for an amendments convention called under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, on the application of the legislatures of two‚Äìthirds of the several states, to propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that affirms every citizen‚Äôs freedom to vote and restores free and fair elections in America; and generally relating to an application to Congress for a convention to propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution\\"); the joint resolution made no further progress--not even to be transmitted to the Maryland House of Delegates for possible concurrence; *Tennessee whose Senate on March 6, 2014, approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 493 (\\"A RESOLUTION to make application to the Congress of the United States pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution to call a constitutional convention for the sole purpose of proposing a balanced budget amendment\\"); the joint resolution then died in the Committee on State Government of the Tennessee House of Representatives (refer, however, to House Joint Resolution No. 548, which was likewise approved by both chambers of the Tennessee General Assembly in 2014, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); and *Wisconsin whose \\"lower\\" chamber, the Assembly, on February 18, 2014, approved Assembly Joint Resolution No. 81 (\\"Relating to: application to Congress under the provisions of Article V of the Constitution of the United States for a convention for proposing amendments relating to a balanced budget\\"); the joint resolution was referred to the Committee on Government Operations, Public Works, and Telecommunications in the Wisconsin Senate, where it died. =2015= During the 2015 state legislative season, it is known that Article V Convention applications received the approval of one chamber of the following 16 bicameral state legislatures: *Arizona whose House of Representatives on February 12, 2015, approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 2003 (\\"applying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States\\") \\"limited to proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States that impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government and limit the terms of office for its officials and for members of Congress\\";

No. 2 by the Maryland House of Delegates and requested the appointment of a conference committee to adjust the differences between the two legislative chambers; a conference committee was appointed, but appears to have not taken action; the 2015 session of the Maryland General Assembly concluded on that same date and the joint resolution thusly died; *Missouri whose Senate on April 22, 2015, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 21 (\\"applies to Congress for the calling of a convention to propose certain amendments to the United States Constitution which place limits on the federal government\\") which had been combined with S.C.R. No. 19 and with S.C.R. No. 23; one floor amendment to S.C.R. No. 21 was adopted in the full Senate; S.C.R. No. 21 then went to the Missouri House of Representatives for consideration, where it was favorably discharged from both the Committee on Government Efficiency as well as the Select Committee on General Laws; S.C.R. No. 21 was placed on the House's calendar for May 15, 2015, but nothing happened with it (refer, however, Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4, which was adopted by both chambers of the Missouri General Assembly, during its 2017 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); and whose Senate on April 22, 2015, likewise approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 24 (\\"urges Congress to call an Article V Convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to the United States Constitution\\") relative to over-turning the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 2010 case of Citizens United v.

No. 24 then went to the Missouri House of Representatives for consideration, where it was favorably discharged from both the Committee on Energy and the Environment as well as the Select Committee on Utilities; and while favorably discharged from both of those committees, S.C.R. No. 24 was never placed upon the calendar of the Missouri House of Representatives; *New Hampshire whose House of Representatives on March 4, 2015, approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 2 (\\"A Resolution applying to Congress to hold a convention for amendments\\") which \\"...address concerns raised by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United v.

No. 77 then died in the Committee on State Affairs of the Texas Senate (refer, however, to Senate Joint Resolution No. 2, which was adopted by both chambers of the Texas Legislature, during its 2017 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); and whose House of Representatives on May 8, 2015, likewise approved House Joint Resolution No. 79 (\\"applying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention under Article V of the United States Constitution for the limited purpose of proposing an amendment to the constitution to provide for a federal balanced budget\\"); H.J.R. No. 79 then likewise died in the Committee on State Affairs of the Texas Senate (refer, however, to House Concurrent Resolution No. 31, which was adopted by both chambers of the Texas Legislature, during its 1977 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); *West Virginia whose Senate on March 12, 2015, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 13 (\\"urging the Congress of the United States to propose a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution and applying to the Congress, pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, to call a convention for proposing a balanced budget amendment\\"); the concurrent resolution then died in the Judiciary Committee of the West Virginia House of Delegates; (refer, however, to House Concurrent Resolution No. 36, which was approved by both chambers of the West Virginia Legislature, during its 2016 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); and *Wyoming whose House of Representatives on January 28, 2015, approved House Joint Resolution No. \\"HJ0004\\" (\\"petitioning Congress to call a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced federal budget\\"); the joint resolution then went down to defeat in the Wyoming Senate on March 3, 2015, with only 7 yeas and 22 nays (refer, however, to House Joint Resolution No. 2, which was adopted by both chambers of the Wyoming Legislature, during its 2017 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing). =2016= During the 2016 state legislative season, it is known that Article V Convention applications received the approval of one chamber of the following 10 bicameral state legislatures: *Arizona whose House of Representatives on February 18, 2016, approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 2010 (\\"applying to the Congress of the United States to call a Convention for proposing Amendments to the Constitution of the United States [limited to proposing amendments that impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government and limit the terms of office for its officials and for members of Congress]\\"); H.C.R.

No. 2014, with amendments, was approved by the Arizona Senate, thus necessitating concurrence by the Arizona House of Representatives; on May 4, 2016, according to the Arizona Legislature's website, the following action in the House, by a vote of only 6 ayes and a whopping 50 nays, failed: \\"VAC EMER RFE 2/3 VOTE\\"; the website goes on to declare: \\"FINAL DISPOSITION: Failed in House on Final Passage\\" (refer, however, to House Concurrent Resolution No. 2013, which was adopted by both chambers of the Arizona Legislature, during its 2017 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); *Missouri whose House of Representatives on April 21, 2016, approved House Concurrent Resolution No. 57 (\\"an application to Congress for the calling of an Article V convention of states to propose certain amendments to the United States Constitution which places limits on the federal government\\"); the concurrent resolution then went to the Missouri Senate where--after being favorably discharged from the Committee on Senate Rules, Joint Rules, Resolutions, and Ethics--it was \\"taken up\\" on May 11, 2016, but, according to the Missouri General Assembly's website, fell victim to \\"Motion withdrawn - Motion to adopt HCR withdrawn\\" (refer, however, to Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4, which was adopted by both chambers of the Missouri General Assembly, during its 2017 session, and which accomplishes basically the same thing); *New Hampshire whose Senate on March 24, 2016, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 3 (\\"applying to the United States Congress to convene a limited convention for the exclusive purpose of proposing amendments to the federal Constitution concerning election reform that do not abrogate or amend the first amendment to the federal Constitution\\"); S.C.R. No. 3 then went to the New Hampshire House of Representatives for consideration; there, after having been favorably discharged from the Committee on State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs, a motion was made on May 11, 2016, in the full House, to \\"Lay on Table\\" which motion carried with 148 yeas and 129 nays; S.C.R. No. 3 was declared to have \\"Died on Table\\" as of July 27, 2016, according to the New Hampshire General Court's website; and whose Senate likewise on March 24, 2016, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4 (\\"applying for an Article V convention to propose an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that imposes fiscal restraints on the federal government\\"); S.C.R.

No. 3 was then referred to the Committee on Rules of the Virginia Senate; and whose House of Delegates likewise on February 16, 2016, approved House Joint Resolution No. 90 (\\"applying to the Congress of the United States to call an amendment convention pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution for the purpose of proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution that pertains to the subject of balancing the federal budget\\"); H.J.R. No. 90 was likewise referred to the Committee on Rules of the Virginia Senate; *Washington whose House of Representatives on February 17, 2016, approved House Joint Memorial No. 4000 (\\"petition[ing] the United States Congress to call a Convention for the purpose of proposing Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America as soon as two-thirds of the several states have applied for a Convention\\") \\"to address concerns such as those raised by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010)\\"; the joint memorial then went to the Senate of the State of Washington for consideration; there, it was referred on February 19, 2016, to the Committee on Government Operations and Security; on the State of Washington Legislature's website, it next shows the curious entry for March 10, 2016: \\"By resolution, returned to House Rules Committee for third reading\\"; and *West Virginia whose Senate on February 23, 2016, approved Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10 (\\"urging Congress [to] call a convention of the states, under the authority reserved to the states in Article V of the United States Constitution, limited to proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States that impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government and limit the terms of office for its officials and for members of Congress\\"); the concurrent resolution then died in the Judiciary Committee of the West Virginia House of Delegates. =2017= During the 2017 state legislative season, it is known that Article V Convention applications received the approval of one chamber of the following four bicameral state legislatures: *Iowa whose House of Representatives on March 15, 2017, approved House Joint Resolution No. 12 (\\"A joint resolution calling for an Article V convention in order to propose amendments to the Constitution of the United States that impose fiscal restraints, and limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and requesting Congress to similarly propose such amendments\\"); the joint resolution was then referred to the Committee on State Government in the Iowa Senate; *North Carolina whose Senate on April 26, 2017, approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 36 (\\"A Joint Resolution applying to Congress for an Article V Convention of the states with the purpose of proposing amendments to the United States Constitution\\"); the joint resolution was then referred to the Committee on Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House of the North Carolina House of Representatives; *Utah whose House of Representatives on February 27, 2017, approved House Joint Resolution No. 12 (\\"applies to Congress to call a convention for proposing amendments to the United States Constitution in accordance with Article V of the Constitution and limits the scope of the convention to establishing a limit on the number of terms that a person may be elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate\\"); the joint resolution then died in the Utah Senate; and *Wyoming whose House of Representatives on January 19, 2017, approved House Joint Resolution No. \\"0003\\" (\\"requesting Congress to call a convention for the purpose of proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to require that every law enacted by Congress shall embrace only one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title\\"); the joint resolution then died in the Wyoming Senate. Likewise during the 2017 state legislative season, there was one state in which an alleged Article V Convention so-called \\"application\\" was approved by only one chamber of a bicameral legislature. That was: *Hawaii whose House of Representatives on April 6, 2017, approved House Resolution No. 25 (\\"Urging the United States Congress to Restore Free and Fair Elections by Applying for a Convention to Propose Amendments to the United States Constitution.\\") Hawaii's H.R. No. 25, upon closer inspection, is structurally flawed inasmuch as that resolution is strictly unicameral. As such, it was never even transmitted to the Hawaii Senate for that body's consideration, despite H.R. No. 25's laughable and presumptuous inclusion--in its first \\"resolving clause\\"--of the wording \\"...the Senate concurring...\\" as the Hawaii House of Representatives, claiming to be the full Legislature, supposedly \\"...submit[ed] an application to the United States Congress to restore free and fair elections as described herein...\\". Adding further hilarity, H.R. No. 25, in its second \\"resolving clause\\", self-identifies as a \\"Concurrent Resolution\\" when, of course, it is a strictly unicameral--NOT bicameral--resolution. Of course, validity as an actual Article V application requires that both chambers of the bicameral Hawaii Legislature so resolve. On August 2, 2017, the Hawaii House of Representatives' H.R. No. 25 was officially received by the United States Senate, was designated by the U.S. Senate as \\"POM-79\\", and was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in that body (See 163 Congressional Record, page S4764, soft-cover preliminary edition). =2018= During the 2018 state legislative season, it is known that there were four Article V Convention applications which received the approval of just one chamber of the following bicameral state legislatures: *Arizona whose House of Representatives, on February 26, 2018, adopted House Concurrent Resolution No. 2024 (\\"applying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention for proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to set term limits for United States Representatives and United States Senators\\") which then died in the Arizona Senate; *Hawaii whose Senate on April 5, 2018, adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 76 (\\"requesting Congress to convene a limited national convention under Article V for the exclusive purpose of proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution that will limit the influence of money in our electoral process\\"); the concurrent resolution was then jointly referred to the Judiciary Committee as well as to the Finance Committee of the Hawaii House of Representatives; *Maryland whose House of Delegates, on March 13, 2018, adopted House Joint Resolution No. 11 (\\"applying to the U.S. Congress for an amendments convention called under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states, to propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that authorizes regulation of contributions and expenditures intended to influence elections; and generally relating to an application to Congress for a convention to propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution\\") which then died in the Maryland Senate; and *Mississippi whose House of Representatives on March 22, 2018, adopted House Concurrent Resolution No. 56 (\\"A Concurrent Resolution applying to the United States Congress to call a Convention of the States under the provisions of Article V of the United States Constitution\\") which received no further consideration in the Mississippi Senate than to be referred to that body's Rules Committee, whereupon it died. =2019= During the 2019 state legislative season, it is known that there were three Article V Convention applications which received the approval of just one chamber of the following bicameral state legislatures: *Georgia whose Senate, on March 7, 2019, adopted Senate Resolution No. 237 (\\"Requesting that the United States Congress call a convention under Article V of the Constitution of the United States limited to proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to set a limit on the number of terms that a person may be elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives and to set a limit on the number of terms that a person may be elected as a member of the United States Senate; and for other purposes\\") which has been referred to the Committee on Rules in the House of Representatives; *Hawaii whose Senate, on April 1, 2019, adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 131 (\\"REQUESTING CONGRESS TO CONVENE A LIMITED NATIONAL CONVENTION UNDER ARTICLE V OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION FOR THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THAT WILL LIMIT THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS\\") which was referred both to the Committee on Finance and to the Committee on the Judiciary in the Hawaii House of Representatives; and *West Virginia whose House of Delegates on March 8, 2019, adopted House Concurrent Resolution No. 61 (\\"Applying to and urging Congress to call a convention of the states, under the authority reserved to the states in Article V of the United States Constitution, limited to proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States and to limit the terms of office that a person may be elected as a Member of the United States House of Representatives and to set a limit on the number of terms that a person may be elected as a Member of the United States Senate\\") which ran out of time for consideration in the Senate. Attempts to limit or restrict delegates attending an Article V Convention The last time that a proposed Federal law was introduced in Congress to establish procedures for--and to impose limitations and restrictions upon--delegates attending an Article V amendatory convention was in 1991 when United States Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah offered the bill S. 214 (\\"Constitutional Convention Implementation Act of 1991\\") during the 102nd Congress. Senator Hatch's proposed Federal legislation received no further consideration than to be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in the United States Senate on January 15, 1991. Noting that, for more than two decades, Congress has demonstrated no interest in clarifying, via Federal statute, the limitations and restrictions of an Article V amendatory convention--and deeming it proper to take matters into their own hands--lawmakers in exactly half of the 50 states have offered legislation in recent years to impose, in state law, limitations and restrictions upon delegates (from those specific states) who would be participating in a national Article V Convention. While there might be others, the following are known examples from 25 states: =2011= *Hawaii in which Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 86 was introduced (\\"Providing for the appointment of convention delegates to the convention to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution\\") and which--had it been approved--would have resolved that Hawaii's delegates \\"...consider themselves an extension of the [Hawaii] Legislature.\\"; the concurrent resolution died in the Hawaii Senate's Committee on Judiciary and Labor as well as in its Committee on Ways and Means; *Illinois in which Senate Bill No. 2204 was introduced (\\"Creates the No Runaway Convention and Single Amendment Limitation Act. Provides that no delegate from Illinois to a Convention has the authority to vote to consider or approve any proposed amendment to the United States Constitution other than the amendment authorized in the Madison Amendment (an Amendment concerning fiscal discipline, legislative transparency, and unfunded mandates.) Sets forth the provisions of the Madison Amendment. Sets forth the oath and duties of an Illinois delegate\\"); on February 10, 2011, the bill was referred to the Illinois Senate's Committee on Assignments; on March 2, 2011, it was re- referred to the Committee on Executive; on March 17, 2011, the Committee on Executive postponed the bill; on March 18, 2011, the bill was re-referred to the Committee on Assignments; the bill made no further progress; *New Mexico in which House Bill No. 121 was introduced (\\"Relating to the United States Constitution; Providing for Participation in a Constitutional Convention to Consider only one Subject; Providing a Penalty\\"); the bill was referred to-- and died in--the Consumer and Public Affairs Committee of the New Mexico House of Representatives; and *Tennessee in which both House Bill No. 1704 and Senate Bill No. 1473 were introduced (\\"An Act amend[ing] Tennessee Code Annotated, relative to limiting the authority of delegates to Article V Amendment Conventions\\"); H.B. No. 1704 died in the Committee on State and Local Government in the Tennessee House of Representatives; while S.B. No. 1473 died in the Committee on State and Local Government of the Tennessee Senate. =2012= *Idaho in which Senate Bill No. 1362 was introduced (\\"relating to an application of the State of Idaho under Article V of the United States Constitution for a convention for proposing amendments to the United States Constitution; providing legislative intent; amending Title 67, Idaho Code, by the addition of a new Chapter 93, Title 67, Idaho Code, to define terms, to provide for the instruction to, scope and limitation of authority of, and compensation of said delegates, to provide duties of the Secretary of State and to provide a citation\\"); this bill was defeated, on a roll-call vote, on the floor of the Idaho Senate on March 14, 2012, with a vote of 13 yeas and 21 nays; *New Hampshire in which Senate Bill No. 356 was introduced (\\"An Act limiting the authority of delegates to Article V amendment conventions\\"); this bill was approved by the New Hampshire Senate on February 8, 2012; the bill was subsequently approved, with amendment, by the New Hampshire House of Representatives on May 15, 2012; on June 6, 2012, both bodies adopted the conference committee report adjusting the differences between the two chambers. However, the bill was then vetoed by the Governor; on June 27, 2012, the New Hampshire Senate voted to override the Governor's veto, but--on that same day--the House of Representatives was not able to muster the super-majority vote necessary for overriding that veto; *South Dakota in which House Bill No. 1222 was introduced (\\"An Act to limit the authority of South Dakota delegates to an Article V convention to amend the United States Constitution, to prohibit any delegate from exceeding such authority, and to provide certain penalties therefor\\"); the bill died in the Committee on Local Government in the South Dakota House of Representatives; *Tennessee in which both House Bill No. 3707 and Senate Bill No. 3695 were introduced (\\"An Act to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 3, relative to limiting the authority of delegates to an Article V Amendment Convention\\"); H.B.

Legislation offered in Congress to call an Article V Convention In January 1975, during the 94th Congress, U.S. Congressman Jerry Pettis, a Republican from California, introduced House Concurrent Resolution No. 28, calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution. In H.Con.Res. 28, Pettis proposed that each state would be entitled to send as many delegates to the convention as it had Senators and Representatives in Congress and that such delegates would be selected in the manner designated by the legislature of each state. With Pettis' death, his colleague, Representative Norman F. Lent, a Republican from New York, introduced similar legislation, House Concurrent Resolution No. 340, during August 1977, for the consideration of the 95th Congress. Both the Pettis and Lent concurrent resolutions received no further consideration than to be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in the U.S. House of Representatives. Other proposals for a Convention of the States Employing a slightly different strategy not attempted previously, there was, in the years 2013 through 2016, a movement afoot within the legislatures of some states to invoke that provision of the United States Constitution which allows for interstate compacts (namely Article I, Section 10) to be utilized for setting uniform ground rules on the applying process for the calling of an Article V convention to propose an amendment to the Constitution which, if such an amendment were to be ratified, would require that the Federal budget be balanced.

Taking yet another approach is the concept of a \\"management study\\" offered during 2013 in North Dakota (House Bill No. 1446) which a management study would be \\"...related to the calling of a convention under article V of the United States Constitution, including concerns associated with a 'runaway' convention and methods through which states have addressed those concerns...\\".

H.Con.Res. 26 has received no further consideration than to be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in the U.S. House of Representatives on March 19, 2015. Congressional maintenance of Article V applications and rescissions One issue of concern over the years has been official receipt by Congress of the applications, and of the rescissions, approved by state lawmakers. In some instances, the process went very smoothly with Congress--particularly the Senate--expeditiously providing readers of the Congressional Record with the full verbatim texts of such applications, or rescissions, which were then referred to committee. But in other cases, retransmitting to Congress the state legislative documents--in some instances multiple times--was necessary for those state documents to finally be entered word-for-word into the Congressional Record. South Carolina's above-mentioned H. 3400--approved in 2004--would be a prime example. It took nearly a full decade for that resolution of rescission to be entered into the Congressional Record and to be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Virginia's 2004 House Joint Resolution No. 194 was similarly situated. As an outgrowth of that frustration, on March 18, 2014, Senate Joint Memorial No. 104 was approved by the Idaho Legislature calling upon Congress to \\"...maintain a record of the Article V applications of the states in a form that is open and accessible to the people of the United States.\\" On May 15, 2014, Idaho's S.J.M. No. 104 was designated as \\"POM-231\\"; was referred to the U.S. Senate's Committee on the Judiciary; and was published verbatim in the U.S. Senate's portion of the Congressional Record.

Early career  Karl Str√∂lin was born in 1890 into a religious family in Berlin, Germany. As the son of an Army General, he first pursued a career as an officer and took part in the First World War. In 1920, he was forced to leave the military along with thousands of other officers per the disarmament provisions of the Versailles Treaty. He received his doctorate with a thesis on the situation of workers and the middle class before and after the First World War. In 1923 he joined the newly founded National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi Party), and after it was banned in the mid-1920s, joined again in 1931.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, , p. 609.  Nazi politician  In 1931, Str√∂lin stood as the NSDAP candidate in Stuttgart‚Äôs mayoral election against the incumbent Karl Lautenschlager. Str√∂lin had to accept significant defeat, receiving only 26,000 votes to Lautenschlager‚Äôs 115,000. Nevertheless, Str√∂lin won in subsequent local elections for Stuttgart City Council and became Chairman of the Nazi faction. After the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933, he deposed Lautenschlager and took over the post of Lord Mayor of Stuttgart. Supported by Wilhelm Murr, Gauleiter of W√ºrttemberg, Str√∂lin removed not only mayor Lautenschlager, but also all the SPD deputies from the City Council. Within weeks, he also dismissed hundreds of employees in the entire city government and replaced them with Nazi party members. In 1933, among many other appointments, Str√∂lin became Chairman of the Deutsches Ausland-Institut (DAI). This organisation, originally designed in 1917 for the care and documentation of ethnic Germans abroad, became deeply involved in Nazi Volkstum racial policies. During his tenure as mayor, Str√∂lin travelled repeatedly to Berlin to promote his city to those in power. As a result, Stuttgart received the honorary title \\"City of the Volksdeutsche\\" from Adolf Hitler. Str√∂lin rose up into the senior leadership of the Nazi Party.  Second World War  Between 1941 and 1945, Str√∂lin was at least partly responsible for the deportation of more than 2,000 Jews from Stuttgart Nordbahnhof to the concentration camps. With few exceptions, all were murdered in the Holocaust. They are commemorated today by a memorial entitled \\"Zeichen der Erinnerung\\" (Signs of Memory) on the former goods railway premises. As the war turned against Germany, Str√∂lin had contact with Leipzig Mayor Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who was involved in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. Following the failure of the plot, Str√∂lin's home was searched but nothing incriminating was found. Nevertheless, he was discharged from the leadership of the Nazi Party and remained Lord Mayor of Stuttgart in name only. In April 1945, as French and American troops were advancing on Stuttgart, Gauleiter Wilhelm Murr called for the city to be defended at all costs. As a former army officer Str√∂lin knew the city could not possibly be defended in its valley location. The city centre had already been heavily damaged by Allied bombing raids, and ground combat would not only destroy remaining intact buildings and utilities but also kill thousands more inhabitants. Through his personal intervention he prevented demolition of the bridge over the River Neckar, over which the main water supply lines ran into Stuttgart. Str√∂lin then secretly contacted the French Army and offered the peaceful surrender of his hometown. When Str√∂lin‚Äôs contacts with the enemy were discovered, an arrest warrant was issued against him. However, the radio operator who received the transmission refused to pass on the message. Thus not only was Str√∂lin saved from the firing squad, but also the city escaped total destruction. On 21 April 1945, the French 5th Armoured Division occupied areas of Stuttgart on the left bank of the Neckar largely without a fight. American troops advanced into the districts on the right bank of the Neckar up to Bad Cannstatt.Shelby Stanton, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939‚Äì1946 Revised Edition, Stackpole Books, 2006 The next day Str√∂lin surrendered the city to a French General and suggested the non-Nazi affiliated and unencumbered lawyer Arnulf Klett as the new mayor. Post-war  Because Str√∂lin was a prominent Nazi, he was imprisoned by the Allies and spent time in an internment camp at Bad Mondorf, Luxembourg. He was later released after denazification and classified as \\"less incriminated\\". However, he never expressed regret about his Nazi past. Rather, until his death Str√∂lin saw Nazism as a good political idea in principle which had only been betrayed by Hitler and his entourage. In 1950, he published a book \\"Stuttgart in the Final Stages of the War\\". In the early 1950s he obtained a pension before the Court of the City of Stuttgart. In later life he was attacked not only by the left for his political past, but also by far right circles because he \\"betrayed Germany with his contacts with the resistance\\". Str√∂lin was also the author of a lengthy and tightly reasoned pamphlet entitled ‚ÄûVerr√§ter oder Patrioten‚Äú in which he submitted that although they had pledged allegiance to Hitler those involved in the Putsch of July 20, 1944 were not traitors but patriots. Str√∂lin is buried at the Waldfriedhof in Stuttgart.

It was announced on the Llamasoft blog on January 12, 2012. Its biggest influence is Caverns of Mars from 1981, but includes elements of Lunar Lander and Oids. It is the Minotaur Project game representing the Atari 8-bit family. Gameplay The gameplay resembles that of Caverns of Mars in that the player is required to descend to the bottom of a cavern, avoiding enemies along the way, and then to escape. Rather than blowing the cavern up, in Caverns of Minos the player's objective is to collect an object from the bottom of the cavern and deliver it to the \\"Mothersheep\\" that waits at the top of the cavern. Unlike the original Caverns of Mars, the ship in Caverns of Minos does not descend at a fixed rate: it is sped up gradually by gravity and the player can choose to fire thrusters to slow it down or move it upwards. As the ship moves down through the cavern, it encounters numerous enemies, some of which can be destroyed by firing at them. The ship fires continuously but the bullets fired can be steered by tilting the mobile device. The ship also encounters minotaurs which can be rescued by landing the ship on the ground near them. Landing without damage requires careful use of the thruster and smoother landings are rewarded with bonus points. The game supports four play modes, with a different ship provided to the player in each: * Novice: the player's ship moves side-to-side and thrusts as normal, fires upwards and downwards, and has a strong shield. * Pilot: the player's ship is more maneuverable and has a more effective thruster, but has a lower shield. * Warrior: the player's ship fires from side to side as well as upwards and downwards, but has a lower shield. * Commander: the player's ship does not move side-to-side but rather rotates and thrusts directionally.  Reception  Caverns of Minos received positive reviews from London's Metro Magazine and G4TV. Arcade Life described it as \\"As close to perfect as an iOS arcade game can get.\\" Pocket Gamer published a generally positive review, but criticized the game's surreal graphics and sound, describing it as \\"An accomplished shooter... but Minos is just plain weird and some won't be able to look past the madness.\\" References Category:IOS games Category:IOS-only games Category:2012 video games Category:Llamasoft games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Caverns of Minos"},{"id":"34508941","text":"Joseph Kemp (1778‚Äì1824) was an English musical composer, organist and teacher. He is noted as an early proponent of teaching music in classes and the playing of exercises by students. Biography Joseph Kemp was born in Exeter in 1778 and was a chorister of the cathedral, and a pupil of William Jackson. In 1802 he was appointed organist of Bristol Cathedral; in 1807 he settled in London until 1813, taking a Bachelor of Music degree at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1808 and a Doctor of Music degree in 1809. In 1810, at the Russell Institution Kemp began a series of lectures on musical education in which he advocated the teaching of music in classes and the playing of exercises by pupils in concert. On account of failing health he returned with his wife and family to his native city, and resided there until 1824, with the interruption of a visit to France in 1818‚Äì21. He had founded a musical college at Exeter in 1814. A journey to London in April 1824 proved too fatiguing for Kemp, then in a weak state of health, and he died in his lodgings on 22 May. He had married in 1805, and left at his death his widow, two sons, and one daughter. Works Kemp published two pedagogical works: # Upwards of 100 cards, containing more than 500 points in music, connected with the new system of musical education (1810‚Äì19) # The new system of musical education, being a self instructor and serviceable companion to music masters (c. 1821) His compositions include: # Op.

Ince and starring Anderson. The film's plot has Jennie Lee and her father heading to California in a prairie schooner. Jennie Lee's father becomes intoxicated before Indians attack them for trespassing on the land. Unable to convince her father to get in the carriage, Jennie Lee flees and races the Indians and is led to a deserted shack by a cowboy as his partner heads off for aid. The two are saved as the ranchmen return and disperse the Indians. The film was not released with a cast of credits as typical of its production era. The production took place on the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch and was released under the Essany label. The completed film was approximately 990 feet in length and was met with mixed reviews. The film's status is unknown, but likely lost. Plot summary A summary of the plot was provided in The Nickelodeon states, \\"Jennie Lee and her father are on their way to Golden California, from a little Kansas farm, traveling in a prairie schooner. At the last settlement, visited by the two, the old man, who has a weakness for drink, purchases several bottles of [whiskey], which he begins drinking when they have made camp for the night. A lone cowboy calls upon them and finds the old man in a jovial mood and cautions him to beware: of a hostile tribe of Indians, through whose country they are now traveling. Unmindful of the warning, Lee continues to drink until thoroughly intoxicated, despite the pleadings of his daughter. Suddenly, over the brow of a hill a scouting Indian is seen to appear, sees the wagon and the drunken white, and slipping cautiously away, goes to his Indian village where he informs the other braves of the trespassing settlers. The Indians leap astride their shaggy ponies and with war whoops ride off to make short work of the whites. The girl sees them coming and implores her father to get into the wagon, but he refuses and the girl, knowing that she must act quickly if she would save her own life, springs into the wagon, seizes the reins and urges the horses to their utmost speed. After a long and thrilling ride in which the Indians gradually gain on her, she is joined by the friendly cowboy, who sends a crony who was with him, to a neighboring ranch for help. The girl and cowboy race the Indians and pull up at a deserted shack in which they protect themselves against the Indians until the arrival of the ranchmen, who disperse the Indians. The girl expresses her great joy at being rescued and upon proposal of her cowboy protector that she marry him, she readily agrees.\\" Cast Film credits were almost universally unheard of in 1910 and 1911, because the film's actors were unidentified fans would often come up with their own names for prominent actors. Film studios were reluctant to credit the actors because other studios might hire or the actors could demand a higher wage. Due to public demand and interest, studios began adding credits to their film lists in later productions. *Broncho Billy Anderson as The Cowboy *Gladys Field as Jennie Lee *Arthur Mackley as Jennie's Father *John B. O'Brien as The Cowboy's Friend *Fred Church *Harry Todd *Brinsley Shaw *Victor Potel  Production  In the book Father Goose, a passage notes that Ince was allowed to lease an 8,000 acre ranch \\"on the shores of the Pacific beyond Santa Monica\\". The land became known as Inceville and became a famous production site. Across the Plains was the first of the Bison Company at the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch. The film had an approximate length of 990 feet and was released on April 1, 1911. The film was released under the Essany label. A musical accompaniment of the film was preserved in a comment by an unidentified columnist titled \\"Our Western Correspondent\\" that stated, \\"I was in one of the theaters here the other evening and witnessed the Essanay reel, \\"Across the Plains,\\" and the scene in the cabin where the man and woman are pumping bullets into the Indians making an attack on the place was beautifully illustrated by the genius at the piano, who thumped out \\"Every Little Bit Added to What You've Got, Makes Just a Little Bit More...\\" This song was composed by William and Laurence Dillon.  Reception  A review in The Nickelodeon stated, \\"Here is a dramatic photoplay of the old West which has in it a thrill and sensational race between a prairie schooner, driven by a lone girl, and a band of hostile Indians ‚Äî a picture that will thrill.\\" The dramatic nature of the fictional picture was noted to those who take films as a depiction of actuality and those within the realm of plausibility. The Moving Picture World noted this in its review of the film by stating, \\"A question will be raised upon seeing this film ‚Äî whether it is quite the thing to accept the fact as here set forth that a girl driving a prairie schooner can hold her against Indians on horseback. If the photoplay is looked upon as an accurate description of life of course this scene must be considered too unreal to be included. If, however, the story of the picture is to be considered as the principal feature, then this incident assists in holding interest. It must be admitted that the average audience will enjoy the thrill which this scene affords without analyzing the possibilities of it too closely. The fight at the shack is not improbable. In fact, the same thing has been done a good many times before, while the appearance of the ranchmen and the beating off of the Indians are but incidents which have been many times repeated. That an audience will be pleased with this picture is certain. The improbability of the thrilling race in the first scenes will not mar the enjoyment of the story excepting in a few people.\\" Newspaper ads and critical reviews of the film were scant with known ads in The Daily Missoulian from Missoula, Montana and The Daily News from Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania.

Built in 1969, she is the last manually operated turntable ferry in the world. History Glenachulish was built at Ailsa Shipbuilding Company in Troon in 1969. She is named after Glenachulish, a glen and hamlet near South Ballachulish. In 2006, Murdo Mackenzie, the owner of the ferry, was planning to retire. A community interest company was formed by local residents to buy the ferry and run the service. In 2008, the ferry was featured in the film Made of Honour. In January 2012, following a landslide blocking the A890 road, Glenachulish began a service at Stromeferry. The service crossed Loch Carron to North Strome, avoiding a diversion by road. Service Glenachulish approaching Kylerhea From 1969 to 1975, Glenachulish operated at Ballachulish. After the opening of the Ballachulish Bridge, she became the relief ferry at Corran, Kessock, and Kylesku. The latter two routes have since been replaced with bridges. Since 1982, Glenachulish has operated the Glenelg ferry across Kylerhea narrows between Easter and October each year. The crossing takes only 5 minutes and is the shortest sea crossing to Skye.

It has been given the recommended English name of oily waxcap in the UK. The species has a European distribution and typically occurs in grassland where it produces basidiocarps (fruit bodies) in the autumn. In several countries, H. quieta is of conservation concern, appearing on national red lists of threatened fungi. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1951 by the French mycologist Robert K√ºhner as Hygrophorus quietus and was later moved to the genus Hygrocybe. The specific epithet refers to Lactarius quietus, an unrelated agaric which has the same distinctive smell as Hygrocybe quieta. Arnolds (1986) considered Hygrocybe obrussea (Fr.) W√ºnsche to be an older name for the oily waxcap, but the application of this name is disputed. Arnold's interpretation has been accepted by some modern authorities, but not by others. Recent molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, suggests that Hygrocybe quieta belongs within the concept of Hygrocybe sensu stricto. Description Basidiocarps are agaricoid, up to 100 mm (4 in) tall, the cap convex at first (never conical), becoming shallowly convex to flat when expanded, up to 75 mm (3 in) across. The cap surface is smooth, dry to slightly greasy when damp, bright yellow to orange-yellow becoming duller with age and sometimes developing a greyish sheen. The lamellae (gills) are waxy, yellow-orange to orange, rather widely spaced and broadly attached to the stipe. The stipe (stem) is smooth, cylindrical, often compressed and grooved, and cap-coloured. The spore print is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, inamyloid, ellipsoid to oblong, often constricted in the middle, about 7.5 to 9.0 by 4.0 to 5 Œºm. When fruitbodies are cut or rubbed, they release a distinctive, oily smell, said to resemble that of pentatomid bugs. =Similar species= Several other waxcaps are similarly coloured, but the widely spaced, orange gills of Hygrocybe quieta are distinctive and the oily smell is diagnostic. Distribution and habitat The oily waxcap is widespread throughout Europe, where it typically grows in old, unimproved, short-sward grassland (pastures and lawns). Recent research suggests waxcaps are neither mycorrhizal nor saprotrophic but may be associated with mosses. Conservation Hygrocybe quieta is typical of waxcap grasslands, a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices. The oily waxcap appears on the official or provisional national red lists of threatened fungi in several European countries, including Denmark, Germany (Bavaria), Poland, and Switzerland.

Salix pulchra. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. It is native to northern North America, where it occurs in Alaska, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The species is also found in northern British Columbia, and occurs in Russia.Salix pulchra. Flora of North America. This willow is an erect, deciduous shrub growing up to tall, but usually remaining smaller, especially in the Arctic and in alpine climates. Along with S. richardsonii and S. alaxensis, it is one of the tallest growing willows in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive parts occurring on separate individuals. The inflorescence is a catkin. The catkins grow before the leaves appear in the spring. The leaves are green above and whitish underneath, and hairless. This plant is a dominant species on the tundra in many areas. It commonly grows with sedges. It may form thickets with other species of willow along waterways and on floodplains. It grows in spruce woodlands and muskegs. It grows above the timberline in interior Alaska, and at the timberline in northern Alaska. It often sprouts and grows after wildfire, and it persists in open habitat. This species was formerly known as S. planifolia subsp. pulchra, a subspecies of S. planifolia, but has since been treated as a distinct species. The two willow species have overlapping distribution and similar appearance, but can be distinguished by the longer stipules in S. pulchra. In areas where both willows occur, S. pulchra is often found at high elevations. S. pulchra and S. planifolia also form natural hybrids. Salix pulchra is one of the least bitter-tasting willows in Alaska, and in the springtime, young leaves may be harvested for human consumption. The leaves and shoots were eaten by the Eskimo raw and dried, or stored in seal oil for future use. The leaves were also used to brew tea and make soup.Salix pulchra. University of Michigan Ethnobotany. At Nunivak Island, parts of this plant were chewed to treat ailments such as mouth sores and pain. This willow also provides a good source of vitamin C.

He had a long association with the Linnaean Society of New York (LSNY) as well as with the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). He was an expert on Neotropical birds. Biography Eisenmann was born in Panama and, though he was based throughout his adult life in New York City, he returned to Panama almost annually in order to study the birdlife and visit his family. He was bilingual in English and Spanish. He received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1930 and was a partner in the New York law firm of Proskauer Rose until 1956. Ornithology Eisenmann served as President of the LSNY from 1947 to 1949, and was later elected a Fellow. In 1956, he resigned from the legal profession to pursue his interest in studying the birds of Central America and the adjacent region. The following year, he became a Research Associate of the AMNH, a position he held until his death. He was editor of the AOU's journal The Auk in 1958‚Äì59, vice president of the AOU in 1967‚Äì69, and chairman of the AOU's Check-list Committee from 1966 until his death. He was a member of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. He published over 150 papers on ornithology, and his The Species of Middle American Birds is Volume 7 of the Transactions of the LSNY. He also co-wrote The Species of Birds of South America with Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee. Legacy Following Eisenmann's death from a heart attack in 1981, the LSNY established the Eisenmann Medal, an award to recognise ornithological excellence and encourage amateur ornithologists, with the inaugural award being made to Ernst Mayr in 1983. In 2000 the Fundaci√≥n Avifauna Eugene Eisenmann (Eugene Eisenmann Bird Foundation) was established in Panama by a group of Panamanian and American bird lovers with the mission of protecting Panama's birds and their habitats. In 2003 it obtained a 20 ha concession at Pipeline Road in central Panama for the construction of the Panama Rainforest Discovery Center in the Soberan√≠a National Park.

FPIES presents in two different forms: an acute form and a chronic form. In its acute form, FPIES presents with vomiting that usually beings 1 to 4 hours after trigger food ingestion (can be 30 minutes to 6 or more hours). Vomiting is often followed by a paleness to the skin, lethargy, and potentially watery, perhaps blood-tinged diarrhea. In the severe form of acute FPIES, a person will vomit until dehydration and until a shock-like state, which can occurs in 15% of patients.Nowak-Wegrzyn A, Muraro A. Food protein- induced enterocolitis syndrome. Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology 2009; 9:371-7. In its chronic form, which can be difficult to diagnose until a person has already met diagnostic criteria for acute FPIES, after repeated or regular ingestion of the trigger food, the person presents with chronic or episodic vomiting, failure to thrive, and watery, perhaps blood-tinged diarrhea. FPIES can potentially develop at any age but seems most commonly to develop within the first few years of life. FPIES has mainly been documented in young infants, but can exist in older children and adults. Some people develop both FPIES and an IgE-mediated type of reaction to the same food, and having FPIES can increase a person's risk of also developing IgE- mediated food allergies. Signs and symptoms In the severe form, symptoms include abdominal pain, profuse vomiting, lethargy, potentially diarrhea, and even shock. Additional symptoms could potentially include - but are not limited to - headache, pallor, lethargy, constipation, and abdominal swelling (distension). Laboratory studies might reveal hypoalbuminemia, anemia, eosinophilia, and an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift. Over half of patients experiencing an acute FPIES reaction may develop thrombocytosis (platelets >500 x109/L). In both chronic and acute FPIES, both methemoglobinemia and metabolic acidosis (mean pH around 7.03 in one study) have been reported. Anand RK, Appachi E. Case report of methemoglobinemia in two patients with food protein-induced enterocolitis. Clinical pediatrics 2006; 45:679-82. Endoscopy may reveal a gastric erythema, edema, mucosal friability, and gastric antral erosions. The exact mechanism is unclear, but it is hypothesized to be a T cell driven disorder. Upon re-exposure to the offending food after a period of elimination, a subacute syndrome can present with repetitive emesis and dehydration. Diagnosis Diagnosis is primarily based on history as specific IgE and skin prick tests are typically negative and the exclusion of other disorders that present similar clinical features, such as infectious gastroenteritis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, food protein-induced enteropathy, food protein-induced proctocolitis, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis, among others. Treatment Avoid feeding affected individuals the foods known to trigger an allergic response. Cow's milk, soy, and cereal grains are the most common trigger foods, but other foods have been reported including eggs, meats (poultry, beef, pork), seafood (fish, shrimp, mollusks), peanut, potatoes, nuts, and fruits (apple, pear, banana, peach, watermelon). The list of potential food triggers is varied and can be somewhat region specific. There are also cases of FPIES being transmitted through foods in breast milk in rare occasions.Monti G, Castagno E, Liguori SA, Lupica MM, Tarasco V, Viola S, et al. Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome by cow's milk proteins passed through breast milk. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 2011; 127:679-80. During an acute FPIES episode, ondansetron is often used to control symptoms in children over 6 months of age. Many breastfeeding mothers either eliminate the food from their diet although this is not always necessary or switch to an extensively hydrolyzed or elemental formula if there is a concern about cow's milk being an offending culprit. Some children tolerate soy based formulas if they have FPIES to cow's milk but many do not. Most infants diagnosed with FPIES outgrow it by the time they reach school age or sometime within their school-aged years.

It is the largest Catholic cemetery in Istanbul. The cemetery is at Ferik√∂y neighborhood in ≈ûi≈üli district of Istanbul, nearly north of Taksim Square. The main Protestant burial ground of the city; Ferik√∂y Protestant Cemetery, Istanbul lies just across the Catholic cemetery. Two neighboring cemeteries are divided by a road; Abide-i H√ºrriyet avenue. History and description The origins of the cemetery date back to 1853, when the Ottoman government declared that the graveyard of the Franks at Pera was no longer suitable as a burial ground. A new site was granted near the Imperial War Academy in Pangaltƒ± as a cemetery for Istanbul's Protestant and Catholic communities. This initiative aimed at clearing ground for urban development in the Taksim area. Four years later, the allotted space was deemed insufficient for the dead of both communities, and a second grant - issued by order of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I in 1857. Between 1840 and 1910, the area of Istanbul stretching northward from Taksim to ≈ûi≈üli was transformed from open countryside to densely inhabited residential settlement. Early 19th century maps of Istanbul show much of the area in this direction taken up by the non-Muslim burial grounds of the Grand Champs des Morts, with the Frankish section directly in the path of the main route of expansion, including the widening of the main road running from Taksim to Pangaltƒ±. Due to this reason, the human remains were exhumed from the old Frankish burial ground in the Grand Champs des Morts and they were transferred, along with their grave markers, to its current location in 1863-1864 in Ferik√∂y - created by order of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I in the 1850s - for re-interment. The burial ground is separated by six squares and alleys with names of saints, extending from east to west. The ornate mausoleums of the great Levantine families are located in the west (Corpi, Botter, Tubini, Glavany). Several monuments have been erected in honour of the French and Italian soldiers died during the Crimean War (1853-1856). The ossuary is made from reclaimed gravestones in old cemeteries of the Petits-Champs and Grand Champs at Pera in the 1850s. The cemetery is used by various Catholic communities. The tombstones of the Levantines are the most numerous, but there are also monuments of Greek Catholics, Armenian Catholics, Syrian, Chaldean and Melkite communities. There are other Catholic cemeteries in Istanbul, especially in the city districts of Kadƒ±k√∂y, Prinkipos and .

History =Vanbrugh years= The castle was designed and built after Vanbrugh had been the architect of the baroque houses at Castle Howard and Blenheim Palace, and shortly after Vanbrugh succeeded his architectural mentor Christopher Wren as Surveyor to the Royal Naval Hospital in 1716. Vanbrugh took a lease of a 12-acre triangular site of the Westcombe estate from Sir Michael Biddulph, 2nd Baronet in 1718, now known as Vanbrugh Fields. In contrast to the baroque style used for his professional commissions, he chose a more medieval, almost gothic, style for his own house. Built on the southwestern corner of the triangular site, it predates the first clearly Gothic Revival house at Strawberry Hill by 30 years. The main structure was finished in 1719, a three-storey square keep with basement built in brick with tall narrow windows, augmented on the south side square by three four-storey towers: two square flanking towers with battlements and a central projecting circular tower enclosing stairs capped by a conical copper roof. An arched corbel table below the moulded parapet is a feature unique to Vanbrugh at this date, also found at Kings Weston House (1710‚Äì1725). The building's narrow sash windows echo medieval arrowslits or lancets. A garden on the building's lead roof makes the most of the views over the Thames and London. Aged 55, Vanbrugh married the 26-year-old Henrietta Maria Yarborough in York in January 1719, and he soon added a wing to the east side of the house in a similar style, creating a lopsided, asymmetric construction ‚Äì said to be the first asymmetric house built in Europe since the Renaissance.Visual Planning and the Picturesque, Nikolaus Pevsner and Mathew Aitchison, Getty Publications, 2010, , p.141-2 It has the \\"castle air\\" adopted in Vanbrugh's remodelling of Kimbolton Castle (1708‚Äì1719), and also used at Shirburn Castle,Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300‚Äì1500: Southern England, Anthony Emery, Cambridge University Press, 2006, , p.156 both early revivals of a medieval style of architecture. It has been claimed that the design was based on the Bastille, where Vanbrugh had been imprisoned for over four years in his youth, and the building may have been referred to as Bastille House before it became better known as Vanbrugh Castle. Visitors from Greenwich would pass by other structures in the grounds designed and built by Vanbrugh ‚Äì the Nunnery, a second smaller single-story house occupied by Vanbrugh's brother Philip;Design of the Nunnery, Victoria & Albert Museum Mince-pie House or Vanbrugh House, occupied by his brother Charles;Design of Mince-pie House, Victoria & Albert MuseumMince-pie House and later added two white towers made from patented white bricks, perhaps for his two sonsSketch of a white tower, Victoria & Albert Museum ‚Äì before reaching a crenelated gateway, with a second gatehouse on the Dover road to the south. =Later history= The house passed through various owners after Vanbrugh's death in 1726. The next owner was Robert Holford (1686-1753) with his wife Sarah (n√©e Vanderput). The novelist Mary Anna Needell, n√©e Lupton, was born there in 1830. Further extensions to the main house were added in the late 19th and early 20th century, but Mince-Pie House was demolished in 1902 and the Nunnery was demolished in 1911. The house was occupied by engineer Dr Laurence Holker Potts from 1838, where he set up a laboratory creating equipment to treat spinal injuries. He left the house before his death in 1850.The Mining manual and almanack for 1851, Henry English, Simpkin Marshall & Co, 1851, p.203-4 Oil merchant Alexander Duckham, who bought the castle in 1907 as his London home, added a prominent weathervane shaped like a duck in flight. He donated the house (and Rooks Hill House in Sevenoaks) to the RAF Benevolent Fund in 1920 to be used as a school for the children of RAF personnel killed in service. Surprisingly, perhaps, the RAF school provided the choir for the Royal Naval College chapel, on the further side of Greenwich park. The boys were initially taught by Captain Slimming, in the only school room, before moving up to the nearby The John Roan School. The Wakefield Wing was added in 1938, but at the outbreak of war in 1939 the boys were evacuated to Rye and Bexhill. Once it was realised that any German invasion would most probably occur in that area, the school moved again to Wales. The building became Grade I listed property in October 1951. The choral conductor James William Webb-Jones was Headmaster of the school from 1951 to 1955. The choral musician Peter Stanley Lyons, who was simultaneously Director of Music at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, was Director of Music at Vanbrugh Castle School from 1950 to 1954. The school moved to Duke of Kent School in Ewhurst, Surrey in 1976. The house was then acquired by a group of four people for ¬£100,000 and converted to four private flats.Property: The living quarters which earned this castle's keep: Sir John Vanbrugh's last home was built in the early 18th century on the lines of the Bastille prison, The Independent, 25 July 1992 In the 1980s, scenes from the film Mona Lisa were performed on location on the front circular driveway of Vanbrugh Castle.

The elections were largely a contest between the governing People's National Party (PNP) and the opposition Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The result was a narrow victory for the JLP, which won 32 of the 63 seats. One political commentator described the poll as \\"the closest election Jamaica has ever had\\". The JLP's share of the vote was the lowest for a winning party since 1962, when the JLP won 50.0% of the vote, and its resulting majority in the House of Representatives was the narrowest since the 1949 elections. A similarly close election occurred in 2007, in which two seats changed hands on recounts. Background Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller announced the date of the general election on 31 January 2016. The nomination date of 9 February 2016 was also announced. The election can be considered as having been called early, as it was constitutionally due between 29 December 2016 (the date in 2011 of the previous general election) and 16 April 2017 (within five years and three months of the date in 2012 of the first sitting of the new Parliament, on 17 January). There is no fixed election date in effect in Jamaica at this time; hence, the choice of election date is the prerogative of the Prime Minister. Electoral system The 63 members of the House of Representatives are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. The Representation of the People Act permits the candidacy of voters above the age of 21. Any Commonwealth citizen residing in Jamaica can vote in the election if they are older than 18 years. To be included on the ballot, a nomination must include the signatures of at least ten eligible voters from the same constituency. The nomination form must then be submitted during a four-hour period on nomination day. Campaign A total of 152 candidates registered to contest the elections, with both the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the People's National Party (PNP) nominating a candidate in every constituency. Minor parties put forward a small number of candidates, with seven from the National Democratic Movement, six from the Marcus Garvey People's Progressive Party and two from the People's Progressive Party. Results Preliminary results saw the opposition JLP gaining a total of twelve seats, taking a slender three-seat majority over the governing PNP in the House of Representatives. No other parties were elected. Among those elected were Robert Montague, Chairman of the JLP, and Juliet Holness. The voter turnout of 47.7% was the lowest since 1983, the year when the PNP boycotted the election. JLP leader Andrew Holness became Prime Minister-designate, regaining the position he lost to Simpson-Miller after the previous election in 2011. Subsequently, however, a recount in the St. Mary South East constituency led to a 127-vote margin in favour of the JLP being overturned and the result being called for the PNP by 9 votes, narrowing the margin in the House to 32‚Äì31. The recount in St. Mary South East had also called into question results in St. Ann South West, St. James South, St. Catherine North Eastern, and St. Andrew Eastern, which were decided by similarly narrow margins. After recounts, the JLP was declared to have 32 seats to the PNP's 31, a bare majority of one. The JLP planned to contest the St. Mary South East recount that saw its margin narrow. The final count, as authorised by the Electoral Commission, was announced on 2 March. Aftermath The new parliament was convened on 10 March 2016,Prime Minister‚Äôs Address at Opening of the New Session of Parliament Office of the Prime Minister meaning that constitutionally the next general elections will be due between 25 February 2021 (five years after the date of this election) and 10 June 2021 (within five years and three months of the date of the first sitting of the new Parliament), unless elections are called earlier by the Prime Minister. A by- election in St. Mary South-East was held on 30 October 2017 following the death of PNP incumbent Winston Green.

The Dutch increased her length by almost a quarter in 1787, gave her six more guns, and made a brig-sloop out of her. The British captured her in 1799 when they captured Suriname. She then served briefly in the Royal Navy as HMS Camphaan before she was broken up in early 1802. Dutch service and capture There are accounts of Kemphaans service in the 1780s (in Dutch). In August 1781 she was at the battle of Dogger Bank. In 1782 she was under the command of Lieutenant Johannes Janse Eye (Jean Jantzen Eye). In 1787 the Dutch extended Kemphaan and converted her to a brig-sloop. Between October 1793 and 31 August 1794, Captain Frans Smeer escorted a convoy of merchantmen to the West Indies. On 20 August 1799, a British force under the command of Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge and Vice Admiral the Right Honourable Lord Hugh Seymour captured the Dutch colony of Suriname.

Writing about Writing approaches to first-year composition take a variety of forms,Downs, Doug & Wardle, Elizabeth. (2012). Reimagining the nature of FYC: Trends in writing-about- writing pedagogies. 10.2307/j.ctt4cgjsj.11. typically based on the rationale that students benefit when engaging the \\"declarative and procedural knowledge\\" associated with writing studies research. History Composition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia. =\\"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions\\"= In 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled \\"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions\\" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed. This course sought \\"to improve students' understanding of writing, rhetoric, language, and literacy\\" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging \\"more realistic conceptions of writing.\\" The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it is frequently cited by those who have continued the work in developing WAW approaches. In the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that \\"writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits.\\" The article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about \\"writing studies\\", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues. The authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write \\"rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study.\\" Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works. =\\"Continuing the Dialogue\\"= After its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled \\"Continuing the Dialogue: Follow- up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.'\\" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first- year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being \\"that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit.\\" She goes on to write, \\"Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand.\\" Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing major and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, Writing about Writing: A College Reader, which was published in 2011. Benefits In \\"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\\" Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including: *an increased self-awareness about writing *improved reading abilities *improved confidence as a student *raised awareness of research writing as conversation WAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article \\"Writing about Writing in Basic Writing,\\" Shannon Carter explains \\"a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves.\\" She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines. Many instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled \\"Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students,\\" Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis‚Äîtwo goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, \\"Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products.\\" Criticism and responses As WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and \\"often in fundamental ways.\\" In his response to Downs and Wardle's \\"Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions,\\" Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues. Kutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend \\"the nuances of the composing process.\\" He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, \\"While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more.\\" In their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's \\"dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge\\", most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their \\"research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once.\\" Downs published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out: > My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to \\"FYC as Intro to Writing > Studies\\" is about as magnanimous as their response itself ‚Äì that is, not > remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of > scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds > ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is > to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the > construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is > bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories ‚Äì for me, > Schwegler and Shamoon ‚Äì planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable. He writes Miles et al. \\"seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner.\\" His main contentions are: *Miles et al. seem only to respond to arguments Downs and Wardle didn't make rather than focusing on the ones they did. *There is a major difference between the type of course he and Wardle advocate from first-year writing and a course that serves as in introduction to a writing major. *Miles et al. grossly misinterpreted the types of readings that are purposed to be involved in WAW, as they are not all of an academic nature and nowhere in Downs' and Wardle's article do they say that it is. *In regards to the criticism that first-year writing students will have a difficult time comprehending readings that are also taught to graduate students, Downs states that it's an \\"admirable goal\\" of writing programs to support this kind of learning, and cutting first-year students off from this type of learning is \\"unnecessarily limiting.\\" He concludes by writing \\"I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities.\\" A response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be \\"lone pioneers\\" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference Peter Elbow as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published \\"Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions.\\" Shannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be \\"off-putting\\" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style. As previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in \\"recruiting\\" more students to become majors in the field. Writing about Writing: A College Reader Published in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as \\"encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy.\\" Bedford St. Martin's, Writing about Writing 10 February 2012. In the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing. They list several reasons as to why WAW is a \\"smart choice\\" in terms of an approach to teaching first-year composition: *WAW engages students in a relevant subject *WAW engages students' own area of expertise *WAW helps students transfer what they learn *WAW has been extensively class tested‚Äîand it works. The book addresses several questions geared towards helping the student understand multiple components of writing: Why study writing? How do readers read and writers write? How do you write? How have you become the readers and writer you are today? How do communities shape writing? How do you make yourself heard as college writer? A mixture of selected readings from both scholars, authors, and students are provided, as well as various activities and discussion questions associated with the readings. =Selected readings= Below are some of the readings included in Writing about Writing: A College Reader: *Stuart Greene, Argument as Conversation: The Role of Inquiry in Writing a Researched Argument *Joseph M.

In a career that lasted from April 1811 to April 1813 he ran ten times and won seven races. In the summer of 1811 he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, winning the Derby on his second racecourse appearance. He continued to race with considerable success for two more years, mainly in match races. He was retired to stud in 1814 and became a successful sire of winners before being exported to Mecklenburg in 1832. Background Phantom was a bay horse bred at Maresfield in Sussex by his owner Sir John Shelley, a distant relative of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Walton, a stallion bought by Shelley in 1804 and based at Boroughbridge in Yorkshire at the time of Phantom's conception. Walton won several King's Plates in his racing career and was successful as a sire of winners. Apart from Phantom, he sired the classic winners St Patrick (St. Leger Stakes) and Nectar (2000 Guineas). Phantom's dam Julia was a sister of the 1801 Derby winner Eleanor. Racing career =1811: three-year-old season= Phantom did not run as a two-year-old and made his first appearance in a Produce Sweepstakes on 15 April at Newmarket. He started favourite at odds of 1/3 but was beaten, finishing second to the filly Barrosa. Two weeks later, Barrosa finished second to the colt Trophonius in the 2000 Guineas. On 30 May Phantom, ridden by Frank Buckle started at odds of 5/1 for the Derby in a field of sixteen runners, with the 2000 Guineas winner Trophonius being made 3/1 favourite. The early leaders were Wellington and an unnamed \\"Bangtail colt\\" who set a \\"very severe\\" pace from the start until half way up the straight. Inside the last two furlongs Magic, the 7/1 third favourite ridden by Tom Carr, took the lead and Buckle produced Phantom with his challenge. In a \\"desperate\\" finish, Phantom caught Magic in the \\"very last stride\\" to win by a head, with Buckle riding \\"in his usual style of excellence.\\" Shelley took a reported ¬£9,000 in winning bets, a \\"marvellous\\" sum for the time. At Ascot on 11 June Phantom ran in a one-mile Sweepstakes. He conceded five pounds in weight to two opponents and won by a neck from Wellington at odds of 4/7. Three days later at the same meeting, Shelley claimed 200 guineas when a colt by Giles was withdrawn from a scheduled match race against Phantom. At the autumn meetings at Newmarket, Phantom was entered in a series of match races. At the Second October meeting Phantom was withdrawn from a match against Tumbler but raced against Truffle on 19 October. Starting 2/5 favourite, Phantom defeated Truffle very easily at level weights in a race \\"across the flat\\" (one and a quarter miles) to win a prize of 200 guineas. At the Newmarket Houghton meeting, Phantom had four engagements and ran twice, after being withdrawn from the Garden Stakes on the opening day. On 30 October he received ten pounds in weight from the six-year-old mare Morel, the 1808 Epsom Oaks winner, and defeated her \\"quite easy\\" in a 200 guinea match over the Abingdon Mile course. Later the same afternoon, Jolter, Phantom's scheduled opponent for a second match race was withdrawn, enabling Shelley to collect a further 200 guineas without running his colt. On the last day of the meeting, Phantom raced in a match for 500 guineas across the flat against the four- year-old Oporto. Phantom started the 1/3 favourite and successfully conceded ten pounds to his older rival. Phantom's earnings for the season totalled ¬£3,000. =1812: four-year-old season= On 2 April, Shelley collected 80 guineas from Sir Charles Bunbury when a match race between Phantom and Bunbury's Sorceror colt was cancelled. On his first competitive race of 1812, Phantom finished second to Rainbow (also known as \\"General Gower's colt\\") at level weights in the Claret Stakes at Newmarket on 14 April, a race for which he started 2/5 favourite. Two weeks later at the same course, he won a 200 guineas match race against the five-year-old Crispin who attempted to concede eight pounds to the Derby winner. Four days later, a match between Phantom and Beverley did not take place, with Shelley claiming 300 guineas in forfeit money. Phantom failed to appear for a match races against Graymalkin on 28 September, Sorcery on 12 October and Elizabeth on 26 October so that by the time of his only other race of the year he had been off the racecourse for six months. At the Newmarket Houghton meeting on 31 October he conceded seven pounds to the five-year-old Eccleston and won a match race for 300 guineas. =1813: five-year-old season= Phantom ran only once as a five-year-old. On 19 April, the opening day of the Newmarket Craven meeting, he was beaten at level weights by Soothsayer in a 500 guinea match race. A scheduled match against Lady of the Lake at Newmarket in October did not take place, with Shelley paying 90 guineas forfeit. In the summer of 1813 a painting of Phantom by James Ward R. A. was part of an exhibition of sporting subjects at the Royal Academy, and was considered one of the artist's more successful equine portraits. Stud career Phantom was retired to stand at the Royal Stud at Hampton Court, at an initial fee of 10 guineas and a guinea for the groom. By 1821 he was standing at Newmarket at a fee of 12 guineas. His last appearance in the list of British-based stallions was at the end of 1831, when he was advertised as covering for the following season at 5 guineas. In 1832, at the advanced age of twenty-four, Phantom was sold and exported to Mecklenburg. Phantom's progeny included the Derby winners Cedric and Middleton and the 2000 Guineas winners Enamel and Pindarrie. His most influential offspring was the filly Cobweb who won the 1824 Epsom Oaks and went on to produce the Derby and St Leger winner Bay Middleton. She was also the direct female ancestor of the Derby winners Humorist and Royal Palace and the Kentucky Derby winner Spend A Buck. Phantom was Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1820 and 1824. Phantom died in 1834 before the breeding season. Pedigree * Phantom was inbred 4 √ó 4 to the stallions Herod and Eclipse and to the mare Virago, meaning that these three horses all appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Furber's group had hits with \\"Just a Poor Boy\\", \\"You Stole My Love\\" and \\"That's When Happiness Began\\" (all in 1966). In the Go Set Pop Poll, Furber was voted in the top 5 as most popular Male Vocalist in both 1966 and 1967 respectively. Furber's subsequent solo singing career was less successful and in the early 1970s he turned to stage musicals: including Godspell and Nuclear. Furber committed suicide on 10 May 1973, by hanging in the garage of his mother's Melbourne home. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, \\"Reputedly in the depths of depression, he hanged himself ... It has been suggested, however, that Furber was actually murdered because he had befriended a King's Cross, New South Wales prostitute\\". Biography Mike Furber was born on 28 September 1948 in London, England. His father was Ed Furber and Furber was raised with a sister Marian. When he was 10, his family emigrated to Brisbane, Australia.McFarlane . Retrieved 25 January 2012. In mid-1965, Furber as lead vocalist joined local pop band The Bowery Boys, which consisted of Robbie van Delft on lead guitar and vocals, Neville Peard on drums, Paul Wade on bass guitar and vocals, and Greg Walker on rhythm guitar. The group signed with Sunshine Records and were managed by label boss Ivan Dayman. Dayman promoted the group as Mike Furber and the Bowery Boys. In late 1965, their debut single, \\"Just a Poor Boy\\", was released and in early 1966 it became a top 5 hit in Adelaide and top 30 in both Melbourne and Sydney. The song was written by Wade, van Delft and Peard. In February 1966, their second single, \\"You Stole My Love\\", was released ‚Äì it is a cover version of The Mockingbirds (who would later become 10cc) 1965 song and was written by Graham Gouldman. Furber's version was a top 10 hit in Melbourne and peaked at No. 12 in Adelaide. The Kommotion label released the group's debut album, Just a Poor Boy. In July, a third single, \\"That's When Happiness Began\\", was issued but the group disbanded in August. Dayman was keen to promote Furber as a solo artist and organised appearances on local television shows: The Go!! Show and Kommotion. Furber released three solo singles in 1967, \\"Where Were You?\\" (January), \\"I'm So Glad\\" (August) and \\"Bring Your Love Back Home\\" (October) but none of them charted. National teen pop music newspaper Go-Set praised \\"Bring Your Love Back Home\\" as \\"the best disc he has ever had. It could be the break he has been waiting for to put him right back on top\\". Furber was one of a number of popular artists who wrote in Go-Set against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, \\"you can't find an excuse for forcing a man to give up his chosen career to go into the army and fight a war in what would be one of the most dubious conflicts of all times\\". In Go-Sets Pop Poll, Furber was voted in the top 5 as most popular Male Vocalist in both 1966 and 1967. Note: This PDF is 282 pages. Furber's label, Sunshine, collapsed in 1967 and Furber had a nervous breakdown at about that time. In 1969, Furber signed with Columbia Records and released \\"There's No Love Left\\" in June. That was followed in November by \\"I'm on Fire\\" / \\"Watch Me Burn\\", which were both written by Vanda & Young (ex-The Easybeats) as a two-part pop suite. According to Iain McIntyre's Tomorrow Is Today (2006), \\"'I'm on Fire' is scintillating pop track underscored by a ripping lead fuzz guitar line and a solid rhythm section\\" however \\"'Watch Me Burn' is even wilder, with TWIN lead guitars (one fuzz and one wah-wah) wailing away beneath Furber's excellent vocal performance\\". Nevertheless, neither of the singles charted and Furber was dropped by Columbia. In June 1970, Furber toured Australia with The Sect, and Doug Parkinson in Focus as support acts to United States group The Four Tops. In the early 1970s, he was conscripted for National Service in the Australian Army during the Vietnam War. At the time of his service, Furber had been involved in stage musicals: Godspell and Nuclear (1973). He was fired from Nuclear. According to music historian Ian McFarlane, he was \\"[n]ever a strong- willed person to begin with, Furber continued to suffer bouts of depression\\". Furber committed suicide on 10 May 1973; he was found hanged in the garage of his Sydney home. According to McFarlane, \\"[r]eputedly in the depths of depression, he hanged himself ... It has been suggested, however, that Furber was actually murdered because he had befriended a King's Cross prostitute\\". In 1999, Festival Records issued a compilation album, Diddy Wah Diddy, featuring his work with The Bowery Boys and solo. In 2005, Radioactive Records re-issued Just a Poor Boy, which Allmusic's Richie Unterberger found \\"Furber was an okay but uneven singer, and in fact sounds rather horribly off-pitch on 'Stop!' He also seemed to favor fairly tough R&B; material that was actually a little too tough for his ordinary range\\" but he preferred \\"You're Back Again\\" and \\"Love Talk\\" as \\"the standouts, both because they're not overly familiar songs and because they're more suited toward Furber's voice\\".

Domestication is the strategy of making text closely conform to the culture of the language being translated to, which may involve the loss of information from the source text. Foreignization is the strategy of retaining information from the source text, and involves deliberately breaking the conventions of the target language to preserve its meaning. These strategies have been debated for hundreds of years, but the first person to formulate them in their modern sense was Lawrence Venuti, who introduced them to the field of translation studies in 1995 with his book The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation. Venuti's innovation to the field was his view that the dichotomy between domestication and foreignization was an ideological one; he views foreignization as the ethical choice for translators to make.  Theory  In his 1998 book The Scandals of Translation: Towards an Ethics of Difference, Venuti states that \\"Domestication and foreignization deal with 'the question of how much a translation assimilates a foreign text to the translating language and culture, and how much it rather signals the differences of that text'\\". According to Lawrence Venuti, every translator should look at the translation process through the prism of culture which refracts the source language cultural norms and it is the translator‚Äôs task to convey them, preserving their meaning and their foreignness, to the target- language text. Every step in the translation process‚Äîfrom the selection of foreign texts to the implementation of translation strategies to the editing, reviewing, and reading of translations‚Äîis mediated by the diverse cultural values that circulate in the target language. He estimates that the theory and practice of English-language translation had been dominated by submission, by fluent domestication. He strictly criticized the translators who in order to minimize the foreignness of the target text reduce the foreign cultural norms to target-language cultural values. According to Venuti, the domesticating strategy ‚Äúviolently‚Äù erases the cultural values and thus creates a text which as if had been written in the target language and which follows the cultural norms of the target reader. He strongly advocates the foreignization strategy, considering it to be ‚Äúan ethnodeviant pressure on [target-language cultural] values to register the linguistic and cultural difference of the foreign text, sending the reader abroad.‚Äù Thus an adequate translation would be the one that would highlight the foreignness of the source text and instead of allowing the dominant target culture to assimilate the differences of the source culture, it should rather signal these differences.https://www.scribd.com/doc/79525793/Translating-Cultures- Translating-Iran-Domestication-and-Foreignization  See also  * Antoine Berman * Friedrich Schleiermacher  References  Category:Translation studies ","title":"Domestication and foreignization"},{"id":"34510170","text":"The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser.

It was released in the United States on November 16, 2012. The documentary includes scenes from a glacier calving event that took place at Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland, lasting 75 minutes, the longest such event ever captured on film. Two EIS videographers waited several weeks in a small tent overlooking the glacier, and were finally able to witness of ice crashing off the glacier. \\"The calving of a massive glacier believed to have produced the ice that sank the Titanic is like watching a city break apart.\\" Synopsis Environmental photographer James Balog heads to Greenland, Iceland and Alaska in order to capture images that will help to convey the effects of global warming. Balog was initially skeptical about climate change when the issue entered scientific discussion, but after his first trip north, he becomes convinced of the impact that humans have on the planet and becomes committed to bringing the story to the public. Within months of the first trip to Iceland, Balog initiates The Extreme Ice Survey - an expedition to collect data on the seasonal changes of glaciers. Balog and his team deploy cameras that utilize time-lapse photography across various places in the Arctic to capture a multi-year record of the world‚Äôs glaciers. The expedition starts off poorly as the team is plagued by numerous technical problems and camera malfunctions. Meanwhile, due to the extreme physical nature of the expeditions, Balog's personal health suffers in the form of knee complications. After making improvements to the equipment, Balog and his team are finally able to collect time-lapse photos that depict the drastic erosion and disappearance of enormous, ancient glaciers. Reception , this film has a rating of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 72 reviews and an average score of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Chasing Ice captures the urgency of climate change while prevailing as entertainment, thanks the awe-inspiring scenery and James Balog's charisma\\".

The monster movie format features two kinds of insects, arachnids, myriapods, and other invertebrates in gladiator style combat in a simulated natural environment. In intermittent breaks, entomologists educate the viewer about the strengths and weaknesses of the dueling arthropods. The opening narration is \\"In nature's fight pit, a host of ruthless bugs as bizarre as they are lethal slug it out in real-life battles to the death. Witness epic encounters between swarms of marauding assassins, and vicious one-on-one clashes where only one bug survives. The world of monster bugs is a jungle, where there's just one law: eat or be eaten.\\"  Premise  The program highlights The Law of the Jungle involving two arthropods of different species, both usually being carnivorous. They are shown fighting to the death with the victor devouring the victim in graphic detail. The program is noted for its use of dramatic theme music and unusual sound editing‚Äîduring combat, the sounds of growling, screaming, war cries, and shrieks of agony, to name but a few, are heard. In addition, other military and ringside sound effects such as bells, bugles, whistles and alarms are occasionally added. Of course, none of these sounds are natural and are only added to enhance the dramatic effect. However, some viewers have stated these sound effects are silly and do nothing but make a good documentary program into something rather comical.community.discovery.com It has been noted that season two has much less sound effects than season one. Despite the odd sound effects, the invertebrate specialists managing the animals for the series took great care to ensure all the interactions were those between species that naturally interact and prey upon one another in the wild. This was the result of hundreds of hours of field observation and years of experience with the various species. Like the vast majority of macro productions, this was filmed in a studio situation to allow for controlled lighting and camera operation. It utilized large natural sets which enabled the animals to behave as they would in nature. Between shots of the fight, the two entomologist hosts of the program narrate the action. Dr. Linda Rayor of Cornell University and Associate Professor Dr. Bryan Grieg Fry of University of Queensland describe each arthropod's abilities that give it an advantage over the other. The entomologists often try to predict the winner of the two. The program is narrated by Henry Strozier. In Australia, the program began airing on SBS on November 14, 2012. It features re-voiced narration by Dr. Paul Willis of RIAUS, as well as a longer running time due to additional narrated footage. Eden began airing the series on February 29, 2016 in the United Kingdom.  Production  The series premiered in 2009. The first season started in 2011 and had a run of six episodes.

Bungarribee is located 33 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.  History  Bungarribee estate was established in 1822 by Colonel John Campbell (1770‚Äì1827) for the purpose of breeding horses for the East India Company. Campbell's Bungarribee Homestead was listed in 2000 on the NSW Heritage Register. One of his sons was Charles James Fox Campbell, a pioneer pastoralist in South Australia, after whom the Adelaide suburb of Campbelltown is named. Following the death of Campbell in 1827 the estate was sold. A subsequent owner, Charles Smith, established Bungarribee stud shortly after 1830, which only had pure-bred English horses. Bungarribee was a major rural employer and breeding area for Australia‚Äôs horse racing industry. Bungarribee‚Äôs horses dominated the emerging racing scene in NSW in the 1820s and 1830s , and many of Australia's most prominent race horses trace their bloodlines to Bungarribee. Steeltrap Drive is named after one of the most successful horses of this era and runs through the middle of the site. Many of today‚Äôs most prominent race horses can trace their history along Steeltrap‚Äôs blood line. Manto Street is named after Manto, one of the greatest horses that was one of the main breeding mares at Bungarribee. Sir Hercules Parade is named after Sir Hercules, who was the sire of the 1866 Melbourne Cup winner The Barb. Additional names include Velocity Parade, Gipsy Street, Emigrant Parade, Emancipation Street and Bet Hyatt Avenue ‚Äì all named after successful thoroughbreds bred at Bungarribee.  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 2,638 people in Bungarribee. 36.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 26.4%, Philippines 8.5%, Fiji 5.3% and Sri Lanka 3.8%. 24.9% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Hindi 13.4%, Gujarati 13.4%, Tamil 4.8% and Tagalog 4.4%. The most common responses for religion were Hinduism 37.2%, Catholic 19.3% and Islam 8.5%.  Transport  Approximately 500 metres from the northern end of the suburb is Doonside railway station, which is on the Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. It provides direct links east to Blacktown, Parramatta and Sydney CBD and west to Mount Druitt and Penrith. Due to the new developments there is a new bus stop on Steeltrap Drive. The Great Western Highway is nearby and provides access to the M4 and M7 motorways.  Recreation  Bungarribee contains Bungarribee Nature Reserve, which provides areas for dog-walking and casual recreation. A cage-free zoo, Sydney Zoo opened in 2019 is to the North West of the suburb (adjacent to the Western Sydney Parklands).

Swasthani Brata Katha A page of Swasthani Brata Katha in Nepali language (ca. 1917). Swasthani Brata Katha is a Hindu tale recited every day for a month, which mostly falls in January and February. The book has 31 chapters which tell the story of life of various gods and goddesses. The story of goddess Swasthani and Shiva is mainly focussed, Swasthani is the Hindu deity known for miraculously granting wishes made in a solemn state by the pure. The sacred book was originated in Ancient civilizations of Nepal. The Brahmins were the first to have read this. It is read mostly by Nepali Hindus in comparison with those from India. This book's story was derived from Skanda Purana. Festival The festival usually begins from the full moon day in the Pohela month of Nepal Era which is Poush month of Bikram Sambat, normally from January to February, and will end on the next full moon day. Every night family members gather around, recite one chapter of the story each day till the 31st day in almost every Nepali family. This month-long festival is marked by fasting especially by women including few men the entire month for the sake of family welfare or getting a good husband or wife.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2012-01/10/c_131352690.htm The festival conclude with an Ashwamegha Yagya, devotees worship god Shiva for whole night. When the festival concludes next month, various types of food are prepared to mark the end of the day and it is believed that every thing has to be 108 pieces even the flowers. Of the 108 pieces, eight are to be given to the husbands, if there is no husband then to son, and if no son then to the son of a friend, and if no friend then the fasting lady has to formally release it on the nearby river. The festival is in fact not a festival. It is a ritual of fasting for 30 days. It is called 'apsan chonegu' in the local Newa language and 'brata' in Nepali. Fasting is voluntary for those interested undertake this month-long brata. Traditionally, the locals of Swaniga - Kathmandu Valley - observed this brata. Swaniga refers to the local villages, towns and cities like Sakwo(Sankhu), Khwopa (Bhaktapur), Yala, (Patan),Yen (Kathmandu), Bhondesh -Bhotan (Banepa), Palanti (Panauti), Phampi (Pharpin), and other Newar localities. Especially people from certain castes of Newars took this brata. In the present day context, the devotees are not limited to Newar community only. There are devotees from all over the country and all the Hindu castes. The devotees from Brahmin and Chhetri communities are increasing year by year. During the Brata, God Madhavnarayan is worshipped. It seems that the brata is a blend of Shaiva and Vaishnav culture.

Toxik Ephex live in 2005 at the Lemon Tree, Aberdeen. History The Abductors were formed by Gary 'Wee Eck' Dawson on vocals, Keith Thomson on drums, Steve 'Steppe' Dempster on bass and Fred 'Inspector Blake' Wilkinson on guitar. Members came and went, such as Jimmy Sim on Drums and 'Trouper' on bass. By September 1980, the bands noxious reputation, combined with tragic, unconnected events elsewhere in Aberdeen, precipitated a change of name. Blakey found the name in a medical book whilst working as a pharmacy technician. Toxik's first recording was a live recording made at the 62 Club in Aberdeen. They cut the track \\"Police Brutality\\" to tape which was later included on the compilation record Bullshit Detector Vol.2 on Crass Records. The line up changed again in 1982 with Mikey \\"Gloo Pimp\\" Smith joining on bass guitar and \\"Chiz the Whizz\\" joining on drums. In September 1985, Dod Copland replaced Dawson on vocals with Frank Benzie joining on guitar soon after, thus forming the classic (and most familiar) Toxik Ephex line-up. In 1987, the band recorded their first single, \\"Punk As Fuck\\", at Pier House studios in Edinburgh, after the recommendation from fellow punk rockers Oi Polloi. Wilkinson started his own record label Green Vomit Records to distribute the record. The first press, released with hand made covers sold out very quickly, and a repress was made with properly printed covers. In 1988, the band joined forces with Oi Polloi to release a split album. Toxik's side (titled Mad as Fuck) started with their punk rock take of \\"Wild Side of Life\\". In 1989, they released another split record, this time with Welsh punk band Shrapnel. A full-length release followed in 1991, funded by 1-up Records from Aberdeen. The full length would be their \\"final epitaph\\" as the band would split up soon after with the members going in different directions. Toxik's sound is unique and has inspired many other Scottish punk bands such as Ex-Cathedra. Wilkinson is interested and involved in folk music, and Copland (an accomplished piper in his own right) often started gigs playing his bagpipes which won over the crowds in Europe. This fusion of Scottish folk and bagpipes combined with punk can now be heard in various bands such as Dropkick Murphys and The Real McKenzies. Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys rates Toxik Ephex as the best ever Scottish punk band. Reformation The band reformed originally in 1999 with Frank Benzie being replaced on guitar. The band embarked on a mini tour on Scotland with The Men They Couldn't Hang as well as returning to their second home, Shetland. This reformation soon fizzled out with Wilkinson leaving. A completely new line-up was put together with only Copland, Chiz and Benzie remaining from the earlier line-up. This incarnation played their comeback gig with the Dead Kennedys in Aberdeen. The band soon split again, but were to reform with Wilkinson and Smith again for their 25th anniversary. The band now regularly host one off gigs. In 2006, Runnin Feart fanzine released Toxik Ephex's first new recording in over 15 years, the 7\\" single \\"Civilised\\". Topplers Records from Scotland have gone on to reissue most of their back catalogue, with plans afoot to re-released everything on a double CD set.

Illustration by Louis R√©my Sabattier for l'Illustration Jules Cr√©pieux-Jamin (1859 - 1940) was a French graphologist born in Arras. From 1889 Cr√©pieux- Jamin worked as a dentist in Rouen. He was deeply interested in the works of Jean-Hippolyte Michon (1806-1881), who is considered to be the founder of modern graphology (science of handwriting analysis). For much of his career Cr√©pieux-Jamin analyzed and revised Michon's work, which included reclassification and re-grouping the system of \\"handwriting signs\\", and developing new rules on their classification. In his 1929 book ABC de la graphologie he laid out a classification system of seven categories in which 175 graphological signs are grouped. The seven categories he used are titled: Dimension, Form, Pressure, Speed, Direction, Layout and Continuity. As an example the category \\"Form\\" would contain various graphological signs such as: \\"rounded\\", \\"ornate\\", \\"harmonious\\", \\"confused\\", et al. Crepieux-Jamin took a \\"holistic approach\\" to handwriting analysis, and to every element in the handwriting he applied a range of hypothetical meanings, maintaining that the value of a particular sign is not fixed, and its importance and interpretation are variable depending on other aspects in the writing being analyzed.

The revolutions of the propeller per time interval are counted electronically. A current meter is oceanographic device for flow measurement by mechanical, tilt, acoustical or electrical means. Different reference frames In physics, one distinguishes different reference frames depending on where the observer is located, this is the basics for the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field in fluid dynamics: The observer can be either in the Moving frame (as for a Lagrangian drifter) or in a resting frame. * Lagrangian current meters measure the displacement of an oceanographic drifter, an unmoored buoy or a non- anchored ship's actual position to the position predicted by dead reckoning. * Eulerian current meters measure current passing a resting current meter. Types A buoy deploying a Roberts radio current meter, c. 1960 = Mechanical = Mechanical current meters are mostly based on counting the rotations of a propeller and are thus rotor current meters. A mid-20th-century realization is the Ekman current meter which drops balls into a container to count the number of rotations. The Roberts radio current meter is a device mounted on a moored buoy and transmits its findings via radio to a servicing vessel. Savonius current meters rotate around a vertical axis in order to minimize error introduced by vertical motion.C. Reid Nichols, Robert G. Williams, Encyclopedia of Marine Science (2008), Infobase Publishing, . relevant passages online at Google Books, accessed online . =Acoustic = There are two basic types of acoustic current meters: Doppler and Travel Time. Both methods use a ceramic transducer to emit a sound into the water. Doppler instruments are more common. An instrument of this type is the Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), which measures the water current velocities over a depth range using the Doppler effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within the water column. The ADCPs use the traveling time of the sound to determine the position of the moving particles. Single-point devices use again the Doppler shift, but ignoring the traveling times. Such a single- point Doppler Current Sensor (DCS) has a typical velocity range of 0 to 300 cm/s. The devices are usually equipped with additional optional sensors. Travel time instruments determine water velocity by at least two acoustic signals, one up stream and one down stream. By precisely measuring the time to travel from the emitter to the receiver, in both directions, the average water speed can be determined between the two points. By using multiple paths, the water velocity can be determined in three dimensions. Travel time meters are generally more accurate than Doppler meters, but only record the velocity between the transducers. Doppler meters have the advantage that they can determine the water velocity at a considerable range, and in the case of an ADCP, at multiple ranges. =Electromagnetic induction= This novel approach is for instance employed in the Florida Strait where electromagnetic induction in submerged telephone cable is used to estimate the through-flow through the gateway and the complete setup can be seen as one huge current meter. The physics behind: Charged particles (the ions in seawater) are moving with the ocean currents in the magnetic field of the Earth which is perpendicular to the movement. Using Faraday's law of induction (the third of Maxwell's equations), it is possible to evaluate the variability of the averaged horizontal flow by measuring the induced electric currents. The method has a minor vertical weighting effect due to small conductivity changes at different depths. Tilt Current Meter Operating Principle = Tilt = Tilt current meters operate under the drag-tilt principle and are designed to either float or sink depending on the type. A floating tilt current meter typically consists of a sub-surface buoyant housing that is anchored to the sea floor with a flexible line or tether. A sinking tilt current is similar, but the housing is designed such that the meter hangs from the attachment point. In either case, the housing tilts as a function of its shape, buoyancy (negative or positive) and the water velocity. Once the characteristics of a housing is known, the velocity can be determined by measuring the angle of the housing and direction of tilt.http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/epd/ocean/MainPage/tilt/shtcm.html The housing contains a data logger that records the orientation (angle from vertical and compass bearing) of the Tilt Current Meter. Floating tilt current meters are typically deployed on the bottom with a lead or concrete anchor but may be deployed on lobster traps or other convenient anchors of opportunity.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100914102112.htm Sinking tilt current meters may be attached to an oceanographic mooring, floating dock or fish pen. Tilt current meters have the advantage over other methods of measuring current in that they are generally relatively low-cost instruments and the design and operation is relatively simple. The low-cost of the instrument may allow researchers to use the meters in greater numbers (thereby increasing spatial density) and/or in locations where there is a risk of instrument loss. Depth correction Current meters are usually deployed within an oceanographic mooring consisting of an anchor weight on the ground, a mooring line with the instrument(s) connected to it and a floating device to keep the mooring line more or less vertical. Like a kite in the wind, the actual shape of the mooring line will not be completely straight, but following a so-called (half-)catenary. Under the influence of water currents (and wind if the top buoy is above the sea surface) the shape of the mooring line can be determined and by this the actual depth of the instruments. If the currents are strong (above 0.1 m/s) and the mooring lines are long (more than 1 km), the instrument position may vary up to 50 m.

Early life McEwen was born in Stonehaven, Scotland, south of Aberdeen, to Agnes and Alex McEwen. His father fought and died in the Boer War, several years after his mother died of tuberculosis. McEwen was raised by a guardian, Annie Wishart, until he was nine when he went to live with his aunt and uncle in the fishing village of Catterline. When he was 13, he left the village for Aberdeen to find work, first as a baggageman on the Great North of Scotland Railway, then working with horses as a hostler and variously as a farmhand before apprenticing as a blacksmith. At 19, McEwen married Isobel Taylor and, following the birth of their first child, emigrated to Canada in May 1912 where he began his career as a blacksmith in Moren, Manitoba. The family moved to Winnipeg the next year where McEwen joined the Blacksmiths and Horseshoers union and then to Swift Current, Saskatchewan in 1914. The family grew to include two daughters and two sons by 1920 when Isabel died in the Spanish Flu epidemic. Career in left politics McEwen joined the Socialist Party of Canada in 1920. In the fall of that year the family moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan where McEwen joined the Saskatoon Workers Party which subsequently became a branch of the newly formed Communist Party of Canada. McEwen was branch secretary and leader until 1927 when he moved to Winnipeg to work full-time as the party's organizer for Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In 1929, he moved to Toronto to become the party's industrial director. He helped form the Workers' Unity League and became its general secretary. The WUL was the Communist Party's \\"red union\\" centre and focussed on organizing and building revolutionary industrial unions. At its height the WUL consisted of 40,000 workers organized in the mining, lumber, fishery, textile and hotel industries amongst others. In 1930, McEwen led a WUL delegation to Ottawa where he met Prime Minister R.B. Bennett to demand the institution of a system of Unemployment Insurance. Bennett refused, saying \\"Never will I or any government which I am a part, put a premium on idleness or put our people on the dole.\\" In 1935, McEwen was a lead organizer of the On-to-Ottawa Trek of unemployed people which was violently broken up in Regina, Saskatchewan. In 1931, McEwen and seven other leading Communists were arrested following a raid of the national offices of the Communist Party of Canada and the WUL were raided. The eight, including Communist Party leader Tim Buck were sentenced to five years in Kingston Penitentiary for being members of an organization declared illegal under Section 98 of the Criminal Code. They were freed in 1934 following a campaign for their release. McEwen was chosen by the Communist Party in 1938 to go to Moscow and work for the Communist International for a two-year term. Upon his return to Canada in 1940 he was arrested under the Defence of Canada Regulations and charged for ‚Äúcontinuing to be a member of the Communist Party\\", which had again been declared illegal as a result of World War II. He was sentenced to two years less a day of hard labour in the Manitoba provincial jail at Headley, Manitoba. He was ordered released in 1941 but was then detained under the orders of the federal government and interned with other Communists at a detention camp in Hull, Quebec. Internments ended by 1943 after the Soviet Union became an ally as a result of Germany's invasion of the USSR. The banned Communist Party was permitted to reorganize itself as the Labor-Progressive Party. For the 1945 federal election, the party sent McEwen to the Yukon to be its candidate. The Liberal riding association was concerned that McEwen could win and opted not to run a candidate in Yukon riding and instead supported Conservative George Black. The local unions supported McEwen and the LPP's platform of support for collective bargaining, family allowance, old age pensions, workers‚Äô compensation and equality for ‚ÄúIndians and Eskimos.‚Äù McEwen won 32% of the vote, coming within 162 votes of being elected.History of Federal Ridings ‚Äì YUKON (1945/06/11) Subsequently, McEwen moved to Vancouver, British Columbia where he was appointed editor of the party's west coast newspaper, the Pacific Tribune, which he edited until his retirement in 1970. In 1974, he published his autobiography, The Forge Glows Red.

Description Grass Valley trends north-northwest and is nestled between two mountain ranges on the Humboldt River's south. The East Range is southwest, the Sonoma Range is north-northeast. The valley narrows at its south-southeast with the north terminus hills of the Tobin Range meeting the Sonoma Range. The valley is widest at its center, about .Nevada DeLorme Atlas, pp. 28-29. Clear Creek enters from the northeast just north of center, and it drains from the central massif of the Sonoma Range, Sonoma Peak, at .Nevada DeLorme Atlas, p. 29. The valley narrows north and south to about , but widens at the floodplain of the Humboldt River. The center of the valleyNevada DeLorme Atlas, pp. 28-29. is approximately just southwest of Clear Creek Ranch at the west foothills of the Sonoma Range. Access The north of Grass Valley is traversed by Nevada State Route 294; for into the valley it is paved. It becomes the unimproved road, Grass Valley Road, and goes through the valley center-east near the mountain foothills; Nevada DeLorme Atlas, p. 29. further it reaches Goldbanks (site) at the south terminus of Grass Valley, the northwest region of the Tobin Range. Grass Valley Road continues south through Paradise Valley, and then enters the north of Dixie Valley, (and Churchill County).

Cardinal Beaufort raced until he was six-years-old, winning eight races before his death in late 1808. Cardinal Beaufort was bred by the Earl of Egremont who raced him during his early career. Cardinal Beaufort was sold frequently in his later racing career, changing hands seven times in the last two years of his life. Background Cardinal Beaufort was foaled in 1802 at Lord Egremont's estate Petworth House. Cardinal Beaufort's sire, Gohanna, was also owned by Egremont and was second to Waxy in the 1793 Epsom Derby. In addition to Cardinal Beaufort, Gohanna also sired Election, the winner of the 1807 Derby. Cardinal Beaufort's dam, Colibri (foaled in 1793), was a full sister to the mare Young Camilla, the grandam of St. Leger winner Altisidora and Epsom Oaks winner Manuella. Colibri was bred by Lord Egremont and was sired by the successful stallion Woodpecker. Cardinal Beaufort was Colibri's third foal and one of two sired by Gohanna, the other being Canopus. She produced four foals, dying at ten-years of age in 1803 two weeks after foaling Canopus. Canopus later sired an unnamed mare (the Canopus Mare) that produced the Derby winners Lap-dog and Spaniel. Cardinal Beaufort was painted by Henry Bernard Chalon during his racing career, and from Chalon's depiction, he was a large bay horse with a white star on his forehead and one white sock on his left hind foot. Racing career Cardinal Beaufort did not race as a two-year-old and his most important race win was in the Epsom Derby. He had several owners over his three-year racing career and died at the end of his six-year-old year in 1808. Cardinal Beaufort was trained by Frank Neale at Newmarket. =1805: three-year-old season= Cardinal Beaufort's first career start was in The Derby held on 30 May. Fifteen horses started in the race won by Cardinal Beaufort, ridden by Dennis Fitzpatrick, with Lord Grosvenor's colts Plantagenet second and Goth third. Lord Egremont won the Derby for the third time with Cardinal Beaufort, having won the year previously with Hannibal and in 1782 with Assassin. He won the Derby twice more, with Election in 1807 and with Lap-dog in 1826. The running was also notable for a collision between Mr. Best's colt by Dungannon and a group of spectators on horseback that had crossed the racetrack before all of the Derby horses had finished the race. The colt's jockey, B. Norton, was \\"much bruised by the fall.\\" At Brighton on 26 July, Cardinal Beaufort won the Pavilion Stakes beating Charles Bunbury's filly Lydia (a full-sister to the 1801 Derby winner Eleanor) and the colt Jasper while carrying seven more pounds than the other runners as a handicap for his win in the Derby. A few days later, Cardinal Beaufort beat Lord Barrymore's colt Merryman in a match race. At Lewes on 1 August, Cardinal Beaufort was second in a 130-guinea sweepstakes race, losing to Lord Darlington's unnamed colt by Sir Peter Teazle. A few days later at the same meeting, Cardinal Beaufort was beaten by the colt Walton for the 60-guinea Ladies' Plate in his last start of the season. =1806: four- year-old season= Lord Egremont sold Cardinal Beaufort at the beginning of his four-year-old season to William Ladbroke. He first ran for his new owner at the Newmarket First Spring Meeting on 24 April, losing a match race to Colonel Mellish's colt Staveley. In May at the second Newmarket meeting Ladbroke received an unspecified amount forfeiture from Sir Shelley's colt Sir Launcelot. A few days later at the same meeting, Cardinal Beaufort forfeited a match race with Staveley, paying Colonel Mellish 400 guineas. At Ascot, Cardinal Beaufort finished second in the 150-guinea Swinley Stakes to the colt Hippomenes. Ladbroke sold Cardinal Beaufort to Mr. Arthur before the Newmarket October Meeting, where Cardinal Beaufort won a match race against the 1806 Derby winner Paris. At the same meeting on 2 October, Cardinal Beaufort ran a dead heat with Lord Foley's colt Little Peter in a 200-guinea match race and on 15 October lost a match race to the filly Parasol. At the Newmarket- Houghton meeting on 27 October, Cardinal Beaufort beat the colt Dreadnought in a mile-long match race. =1807: five-year-old season= Mr. S. Arthur sold Cardinal Beaufort after the 1806 racing season to Mr. Arthur Shakespear. In April at Newmarket, Cardinal Beaufort received an unspecified amount forfeiture from Lord Darlington's horse Zodiac. Arthur Shakespear sold Cardinal Beaufort to Colonel Mellish at the spring meeting. In his first race under Mellish's ownership, Cardinal Beaufort lost a match race against General Gower's colt Swinley but won a match race against Charles Bunbury's colt Snug a few days later. At the Second Spring Meeting at Newmarket on 27 April, Cardinal Beaufort lost a match race to the mare Meteora and was second in the 50-guinea Jockey-Club Plate to Lord Darlington's colt Pavilion. At Brighton in August, Cardinal Beaufort forfeited a match race against the colt Musician and was second \\"by about a head\\" to Sir David in a 200-guina, four-mile match race. Mellish sold Cardinal Beaufort to Francis Lloyd sometime between August and October 1807, with Cardinal Beaufort forfeiting a match race with Ipswich and the Oatlands Stakes under Lloyd's name. At the Houghton Meeting, Cardinal Beaufort received 75 guineas from Mr. Payne after his colt Tudor forfeited a match race and was beaten in a match race by the filly Epsom Lass. =1808: six-year-old season and death= At the beginning of the 1808 racing season, Cardinal Beaufort ran in William Shakespear's name for two races. Cardinal Beaufort was fourth in the first class of the Oatlands Stakes at the Craven meeting in April, losing to the filly Nymphina and the horses Hawk and Cerberus. For the last two races of his career, Cardinal Beaufort ran in General H. F. Gower's name. At Newmarket on 10 May, Cardinal Beaufort won a 100-guinea sweepstakes race against Meteora and Captain Absolute. At Brighton on 2 August, Cardinal Beaufort received a 100-guinea forfeiture from Mr. Daly's colt Sasenagh. Cardinal Beaufort was listed as \\"dead\\" in the index of the 1808 edition of The Racing Calendar, having died in late January before the start of the 1809 season in April. At Newmarket on 17 April, General Gower paid a forfeiture to Lord Sackville's horse Bustard due to Cardinal Beaufort's death.

Conrad Arcturus Zodiac Conrad (1855-1937) was a Christian author, theologian, and pastor of Park Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts from 1905 to 1937. He was born in 1855 on a farm in Shiloh, Indiana to a father who was a Presbyterian minister on the frontier. Conrad was primarily of German and English ancestry. In 1882 Conrad graduated from Carleton College, a Congregationalist school in Minnesota. In 1885 he received a B.D. from Union Theological Seminary; during his years at Union his roommate was Arthur Cushman McGiffert, later a noted church historian. Conrad went on to study at New York University, receiving a Ph.D. from that institution in 1885; in 1893 Carleton College awarded him a D.D. In 1885 he married Harriet Narcissa Adams from Portland, Maine. From 1885 to 1890 he served as pastor of Ainslie Street Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York. He served as pastor of First Congregational Church in Worcester, Massachusetts, for twelve years. He then went west for a period to recover his health. Later he preached at a Congregational church in London, England, before being offered the pastorship of Park Street Church in Boston in 1905 by Pastor John L. Withrow. Withrow and Conrad served together until Withrow's death in 1909. Conrad served as pastor at Park Street until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Harold Ockenga.

Petroleum News, 5 January 2014. In the investigation report published by the United States Coast Guard on 2 April 2014, the initiating event to the casualty was identified as the failure of a 120-ton apex shackle which was considered undersized for towing Kulluk in such environmental conditions. The 90-feet catenary surge chain used to damp shock loads in the towing line was also deemed insufficient. According to the Coast Guard, the \\"numerous and compounding preconditions\\" that led to the casualty also included various operational issues such as the towing plans that were not adequate for the winter towing operation crossing the Gulf of Alaska and the crew's lack of towing experience in the Gulf of Alaska waters particularly during the wintertime.Report of Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Multiple Related Marine Casualties and Grounding of the MODU KULLUK on December 31, 2012. United States Coast Guard, 2 April 2014. In the same report, it was also concluded that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of main engine power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the casualty, sea water contamination was found in settling tanks, day tanks, main engine primary filters and main engine injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil tanks through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq. Kulluk's movement south for the winter was at least in part motivated by an effort to avoid State of Alaska property taxes on oil and gas extraction equipment. =Proposed sale to US Coast Guard= On 14 May 2015, US Congressman Duncan Hunter of California, began advocating for the acquisition of Aiviq by the US Coast Guard (USCG) due to an availability gap caused by USCG's deactivation of the icebreaker USCGC Polar Sea. USCG repeatedly turned down Hunter's continued proposals, citing the vessel's unsuitability for military operations and being less-capable than USCGC Healy, with Coast Guard Admiral Charles Michel stating Aiviq is \\"Not suitable for military service without substantial refit. [...] We have very specific requirements for our vessels, including international law requirements for assertion of things like navigation rights. This vessel does not just break ice.\\" Controversy arose after it was published that Congressman Hunter had received campaign funding from Aiviq's owner, Edison Chouest Offshore, and contributors connected to the owner, six days before initially advocating the vessel's sale to USCG. Edison Chouest's contributions to Hunter have made them the congressman's second largest donor. The company's donations came as Congressman Hunter was under investigation for misuse of campaign funds. On 12 July 2016, Hunter's advocacy for the vessel's acquisition was joined by US Congressman Don Young of Alaska. Aiviq's owner was Congressman Young's largest campaign donor at that time. Congressman Hunter's office estimated it would cost US$33 million a year to lease, or US$150 million to buy Aiviq outright. = Proposed sale to Canada = Since 2016, Davie Shipbuilding has offered Aiviq together with other out-of-work offshore icebreakers to the Canadian Coast Guard as a replacement for .Aiviq - Polar Icebreaker.

In 1850, Norwegian Moravian missionary Nils Otto Tank purchased the cottage and large tract of land along the Fox River.

He probably came from Freising near Munich, and worked in both towns, as well as Landshut.Shestack Twenty-five of his prints are known: three woodcuts and 22 engravings, most signed \\"MAIR\\".

He is most unusual in adding colour to some prints, apparently by his own hand. Many 15th-century prints were coloured (often removed by 19th- century collectors or dealers) but this is normally regarded as something done later by other hands. He aimed to achieve the effect of drawings heightened with colour, and like many of these, he used \\"prepared\\" coloured paper. Later, the chiaroscuro woodcut would achieve very similar effects by using multiple blocks.Shestack; Hutchison, 27 No paintings by him can be documented, but a small number (about 13) are attributed to him based on similarities with the style of the prints.

In 1497 he is referred to in city records in Augsburg as a painter and citizen of Freising.Shestack; BM Anna Holbein, the mother of Hans Holbein the Elder (born around 1460), was Mair's sister.Hutchison, 26; NDB; RKD entry One of the engravings dated 1499 includes the coat of arms of Landshut, as does the watermark on the paper of another. He also seems to have collaborated with Hans Wurm, a printer and blockcutter there, who probably cut the woodcuts.Shestack; BM His last datable work is a drawing of 1504.Getty George the Rich, the last Duke of Bavaria-Landshut, maintained a famously lavish court at Landshut, until his death without a male heir in 1503 brought disaster to the area, with the Imperial armies of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor devastating it in the War of the Succession of Landshut (1503‚Äì05). It is thought that the majority of his prints were produced over a few years Mair spent in around Landshut around 1499.Hutchison, 26 Samson and Delilah; Samson lies while Delilah cuts his hair off. Engraving on light-green prepared paper, British Museum. There is a painter documented in Landshut in 1492, 1499 and 1514 called \\"Nicolaus Alexander Mair\\", but while some scholars see him as the same person as Mair von Landshut, others do not.Shestack German-language sources often call him \\"Nikolaus Alexander Mair von Landshut\\", as the Albertina does. He is also sometimes given the first name Hans, for no very good reason. Modern sources give a number of death dates, on no good evidence, from 1504 (his last dated work), to 1514 (last record of Nicolaus Alexander Mair) to 1520.Summary on his ULAN page His prints are mostly very rare, with nine of them surviving only in a single impression, but some of his plates survived to be reprinted in the late sixteenth century, and perhaps still more recently.Hutchison, 26 Style Mair favours complicated and \\"fantastic architectural spaces, with walls joining at the most unlikely angles. The scenes resemble whimsical stage sets, and are endowed with an unreal character, like something from a fairy tale.\\"Shestack Apart from conventional religious scenes, which often also have the fanciful architectural settings, there are engravings of couples and some unusual and original images, combining glamorous figures with a moralizing theme. His Annunciation, surviving in a unique impression in Washington, \\"is remarkable for its ambitious but confused perspective, apparently the result of a desire to reference a number of rather complex theological issues\\". The composition attempts to combine the architecture of a church with that of a bedroom, and \\"the foreground of the composition is further complicated by several ill- foreshortened sets of steps that distort the bed-altar area, giving it the elevation of a shrine.\\" Its \\"spatial clumsiness\\" has suggested it is his earliest print.Hutchison, 26 Some engravings survive in conventional black on white examples, and ones printed on paper \\"prepared\\", or tinted with watercolour (as in the Sampson and Delilah illustrated), and sometimes painted highlights as well (as in the St Catherine at top). The colours added by brush include white, yellow and red.Hutchison, 27 Another impression of the Sampson and Delilah, in Vienna, is printed on brown prepared paper with brushed-in highlights in white and yellow.Stijn Alsteens, Freyda Spira, Maryan Wynn Ainsworth, D√ºrer and Beyond: Central European Drawings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1400‚Äì1700, p. 43, 2012, Metropolitan Museum of Art, , 9781588394514; image and details at the Albertina The same treatment is given to impressions of a Nativity dated 1499, in the National Gallery of Art,Shestack, 142; Image at NGA and also the British Museum.British Museum The same print is illustrated here in a conventional black on whte impression in New York (with others in Vienna and the British Museum).British Museum Altogether, impressions of fourteen of his prints on prepared coloured paper have survived.BM Wolfgang Stechow, who first set out the history and depiction of the story, describes his print of The Dead King and his Three Sons as the \\"most subtle and moving interpretation of the story in art, despite its many awkward details\\".Stechow, Wolfgang, \\"Shooting at Father's Corpse\\", The Art Bulletin, vol. 24, no. 3, 1942, p. 223, JSTOR File:AN00146421 001 l Mair.jpgDrawing of Saint John the Evangelist, 1498 File:1943.114 v01 o4 Mair.jpgAnnunciation, see text File:Adoration of the Magi Mair von Landshut.jpgAdoration of the Magi, signed engraving File:The King's Sons Mair von Landshut.jpgThe Dead King and his Three Sons, signed engraving File:The Nativity MET DP847959.jpgNativity, engraving, signed and dated 1499 File:Simpson mit den Toren von Gaza Mair von Landshut.jpgSamson with the doors of Gaza, signed engraving File:AN00045339 001 l Mair BM bridge.jpgThe Balcony; a young man is surrounded by three courtesans and a jester.

A short branch ran from Micaville to Bowditch, North Carolina, . Total mileage was . Rail was 60‚Äì65 pounds and the maximum load limit was 75 tons. Traffic was feldspar, mica, fertilizer, building materials, livestock feed and steel spring wire. History of the Black Mountain Railway The line was built in 1907 as the Black Mountain Railway, an standard-gauge line running from Kona, where it connected with the South and Western Railroad (a predecessor of the Clinchfield), to Bowditch, where a band mill was built to process lumber. The Black Mountain Ry. was extended from Micaville to Burnsville by 1912 and on to Pensacola, Murchison, and Eskota, with a short logging spur built from near Burnsville to Athlone in 1913 to tap the area's lumber reserves. The Micaville-Eskota line was envisioned as part of a longer through route to Asheville, North Carolina, south of Eskota, which would allow the Black Mountain Railway to break the monopoly held by the Southern Railway in that area. Financing for part of the construction came from the Scutte-Lambert Lumber Company for $40,000 in notes, which had pledged the notes to the Holston Corporation (which later acquired control of the South and Western, renaming it the Carolina, Clinchfield and Ohio Railway). When the notes defaulted in 1913, Holston took over the railroad's notes, passing control of it to the Clinchfield, but retaining the Black Mountain Railway name as a subsidiary. While the line was never extended to Asheville, the railroad became profitable for the Clinchfield during World War I into the mid 1920s. Two other short spurs were built off the Burnsville-Micaville section of the Black Mountain Ry. during the 1920s. One, following George's Fork Creek just east of the community of Windom southward for into the Black Mountains, was built by the Tennessee Eastman Corporation in 1923 and was used to haul timber for 2 years, until 1925, when it was removed. The other line, at in length, followed Cane Branch Creek from a point just west of Micaville south to a feldspar crusher on the eastern slope of the Black Mountains. This was removed by the early 1930s. By 1926, the timber reserves west of Burnsville began to be played out, causing the decision by the Black Mountain Ry. to abandon all trackage west of Burnsville to Eskota. The former railroad's grade between those points was then used to construct part of North Carolina Highway 197. From Burnsville east, as well as from Bowditch to Micaville, the Black Mountain Railway continued to haul feldspar, lumber, and general commodities. History of the Yancey Railroad Although the Black Mountain Railway had managed to limp through the Great Depression and World War II, traffic had declined to the point that, by 1951 the railroad's parent, the Clinchfield, had wished itself to cease paying the interest on the original $40,000.00 in notes. The Black Mountain Railway applied for abandonment of all of its remaining trackage through the Interstate Commerce Commission. The ICC granted the request in 1954 on the provision that the line was offered for sale to an individual or a group of locals from Yancey County. As the news of the potential abandonment was made known, citizens begin a fundraising drive to sell common stock in order to raise $70,000 for the purchase of the railroad as well as a new diesel locomotive to operate over the line. The group was successful, and in 1954, paid $22,000 to the Clinchfield for the remaining trackage of the Black Mountain Railway. The railroad was renamed the Yancey Railroad and began operations on April 1, 1955, using a GE 45-ton switcher diesel locomotive built new for the Yancey in March 1955 at GE's locomotive plant in Erie, Pennsylvania as builder number 32344 at a cost of $44,000. The locomotive was numbered 1 and was given the nicknamed \\"Blackie\\" by the crews of the railroad due to her factory black paint job. Number 1 was driven by a sprocket and chain drive and produced 300 horsepower. When not in use, Yancey number 1 was stored at Burnsville in a small insulated engine shed that was built on a section of the former right of way toward Eskota, near the line's depot which served as the railroad's headquarters. Included with the purchase of the railroad was a former wooden boxcar that was remodeled to serve as a caboose/mail/baggage car for the Black Mountain Railway. After it was acquired by the Yancey, the car was turned into a work flat for maintenance of way service. Traffic begin to grow to the point that in 1964, the Yancey had acquired a second diesel locomotive, a GE 50-ton switcher built new in March 1941 at GE's Schenectady, New York locomotive plant for the US Navy as 65-0098, carrying the builder's number 12984. This locomotive was propelled by side rods (rods mounted on the side of the locomotive's trucks in order to turn the wheels so that the locomotive can gain traction) and produced as well. The Yancey numbered the locomotive 2 and nicknamed it \\"Puddles\\" as, according to former Yancey president Bill Cannon, \\"it had a tendency to waddle along the tracks without falling into a puddle\\". Number 2 was usually stored in an identical small enginehouse to the one at Burnsville at the end of the line to Bowditch. For a brief time in 1968, the Yancey Railroad offered steam trips between Micaville and Kona using a former Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal Railroad 0-6-0T oil-fired steam engine #15 and two steel coaches lettered \\"Southern Appalachian Railway\\". This operation was not successful and the equipment was stored in Burnsville for several years before being sold. The 0-6-0T operates today as a Thomas The Tank engine after being cosmetically altered by the Strasburg Rail Road. The Yancey Railroad continued to show a modest profit each year, until 1971 when the Feldspar Corporation closed its plant at Bowditch, resulting in the loss of 36,000 tons of feldspar shipped annually. The following year, heavy rains caused by Hurricane Agnes washed several small bridges and culverts along the line. Both locomotives were stored at different points on the railroad, which made it easier to restore service in seven weeks. The Yancey continued to operate on a shoestring. In August 1976, The Yancey purchased a secondhand GE 65-ton switcher, numbered 3. Number 1 was then sold to the Sigri Great Lakes Carbon facility in Morganton, North Carolina as an industrial switcher. To increase revenue, the railroad began storing boxcars (mostly National Railway Utilization cars lettered for the Pickens Railroad) on the line from Micaville to Bowditch. More flooding in 1977 damaged sections of the track in spots as well as weakened the piers and pilings on the bridge over the North Toe River. This resulted in the loss of much of the Yancey's remaining freight customers. The number 3 was sold off by 1980 to Centex (now PulteGroup) and a former Narragansett Pier Railroad Vulcan Iron Works 65-ton locomotive was purchased. This unit was built for the US Navy in 1943 and was sold to the Narragansett Pier in 1963 as their number 40. This unit was acquired by the Yancey in 1981 shortly after the Narragansett Pier ceased operations and was used for a brief time before all operations on the Yancey shut down in late 1982. Most of the remaining equipment was taken off the railroad by the summer of 1984 (which included the scrapping of GE 45-ton locomotive #2), while the remaining assets were auctioned off in May 1985.

Completed in 2009, the building houses classrooms, offices, and laboratories from several disciplines of the school's College of Liberal Arts. The structure cost $16 million and earned Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification upon completion for environmentally friendly features and construction. Ford Hall is named in honor of Hallie Ford, who contributed $8 million towards construction of the building. History Plans for a new academic building on the Willamette campus surfaced as early as January 2006 when the university hoped to build an $8 to $12 million facility. In October 2006, the university received an $8 million donation to go towards building a new academic hall on the campus. Anonymous at the time, the gift was the largest ever gift from a person to the school, and the second largest donation ever after an $11 million donation by Tokyo International University of America in 2003 to help build the Kaneko Commons. It was later revealed that Hallie Ford made the donation, and the building was subsequently named after her. The new building was estimated to cost $16 million total to build and would be a structure designed to add 25 professors to the faculty and be used to house media studies, computer sciences, rhetoric, and mathematics. Expected to be finished by the new school year in 2009, the hall was to be built next to Gatke Hall on the northeast corner of the campus. Work on the project began with the removal of trees from the site in December 2007. Some trees were moved, while other were planned to be re-used in the new building. Hennebery Eddy Architects were hired by Willamette in 2007 to design the new building, with Timothy R. Eddy as the principal architect. The school hired Hoffman Construction as the general contractor and hoped to achieve LEED Gold Certification for the building. Joshua Carlson was the landscape designer on the project. While originally planned to be , by the time construction began the final design called for of space in Ford Hall. During construction, the Pacific Northwest Regional Council of Carpenters picketed the school in a dispute with one of the subcontractors working on Ford Hall. The sustainability aspects of the building helped Willamette land on the Sierra Club‚Äôs Cool Schools list in 2009, as Ford Hall was anticipated to earn a LEED Gold rating, which was earned later that year. Ford Hall also earned recognition in the 2030 Challenge Award as a runner-up for the as built category. Details North side of Ford Hall Designed by Hennebery Eddy Architects, the structure is adjacent to Gatke Hall and across state street from the Oregon State Capitol. Ford was the first new academic hall on campus since 1996 when the Olin Science Center was completed. School officials hoped to use the project to draw more students to that section of the campus, which was previously underutilized, as well as to incorporate many environmentally friendly features into the new building. These green amenities included using brick, copper, stone, and other building materials that have a long lifespan. Brick is used for the exterior and copper for the roof. Other items include a displacement ventilation HVAC system, solar panels, use of recycled materials in the construction, and maximizing the use of natural light throughout the structure. Overall, the energy consumption is 58 percent less than for a similar building built to code. LEED Gold status was awarded on December 10, 2009, by the U.S. Green Building Council. Ford Hall houses a mixture of programs from across departments within the college of liberal arts. The four- story, brick-faced building houses programs from rhetoric, computer science, film studies, mathematics, and digital art, among others. This includes recording studios, a film viewing room, and a space for performances in the below-ground level. The first floor of the three above-ground levels includes an art studio and art gallery, while the other two floors contain laboratories, classrooms, and offices for staff. These upper floors also contain what the school labels as hearths, in which each department in the building has one, and which they are designed to encourage collaboration between students as well as between the faculty and students.

On April 20, 1861, Weisiger took his battalion to the Gosport Navy Yard at Norfolk, Virginia when it was abandoned by the U.S. Navy, occupying the city as well. He became colonel of the 12th Virginia Infantry Regiment on May 9, 1861. The regiment served on the Virginia Peninsula until it was attached to the brigade of then Brigadier General William Mahone in Major General Richard H. Anderson's division of III Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. Weisiger fought at the Battle of Seven Pines and during the Seven Days Battles, taking a prominent part in the Battle of Glendale. He briefly took command of Mahone's brigade when Mahone was wounded at the Battle of Second Bull Run (second Manassas) but in turn was severely wounded at the battle. Weisiger was disabled until July 1863.Sifakis. 1988, p. 702 is the only one of the cited sources which specifically states that Weisiger fought at the Battle of Gettysburg and in the campaigns during the Fall of 1863. He took command of Mahone's brigade at the Battle of the Wilderness on May 7, 1864, after Mahone was wounded on May 6, 1864. Weisiger commanded the brigade at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House and the Battle of Cold Harbor. He was appointed brigadier general with temporary rank on May 31, 1864. This commission was confirmed June 7, 1864, but was canceled for lack of a vacancy.Eicher, 2001, p. 799. Mahone was not seriously wounded but succeeded to division command when Major General Richard H. Anderson was transferred to temporary command of Lieutenant General James Longstreet's corps.Sifakis, 1988, p. 429.

Weisiger was wounded again in this battle. In recognition of his contribution to the Confederate victory at the Battle of the Crater, Weisiger was appointed brigadier general from the date of the battle, July 30, 1864.Boatner, 1988, p. 899 says Weisiger was given an on the spot promotion by Army of Northern Virginia commander General Robert E. Lee and Wert, 1986, p. 812 says Weisiger received a battlefield promotion but Lee had no authority to give such promotions. Eicher, 2001, p. 67; Warner, 1959, p. xv. Although Weisiger exercised brigade command, the promotion was not legally effective until he was nominated to that rank by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the appointment was confirmed by the Confederate Senate. These steps were taken on November 1, 1864, and February 3, 1865. Eicher, 2001, p. 799. Weisiger commanded a brigade in Mahone's division from June 4, 1864, to April 9, 1865. He was paroled at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865. He had been wounded three times and had two horses shot from under him. Aftermath After the Civil War, Weisiger returned to Petersburg, Virginia where he was a bank cashier. Later, he was a businessman at Richmond, Virginia.

A transdisciplinary institute focussing on literature and cultural studies, it is the largest institute for American Studies in Eastern Germany.  Significance  =Academia= American Studies Leipzig is the fastest-growing institute for American Studies in Germany that is not located in Berlin. In 2003, the Fulbright Commission endowed a newly created Distinguished Chair guest professorship, after the CHE research and education thinktank, part of Bertelsmann Foundation, had attested the institute extraordinary quality.http://www.uni-protokolle.de/nachrichten/id/26785/ In September 2005, the DAAD further distinguished the institute by creating the DAAD Distinguished Chair for American and International Studies guest professorship.http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de/faculty/guest_scholars/ This was intended to honor and further facilitate the institute's eagerness to innovation and its dedication to transatlantic studies. In 2006, the institute succeeded in winning its third guest professorship in only four years. The Picador Chair for Literature is the outcome of a series of events by Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group in cooperation with DAAD. Its purpose is to invite young English-speaking authors to live, write and teach in Leipzig. Thus, American Studies Leipzig is the only German institute for American studies supplementing its program of literary studies teaching with the perspective of actual creative artists, regularly.http://americanstudies.uni- leipzig.de/news/36 Furthermore, the institute features the largest research corpus on the New Deal in a German university. =Beyond Academia= Extra to its meaning for the University of Leipzig, the institute is a component of the cultural scenery of the city of Leipzig. Featuring regular public readings by American authors, public events like the HipHop Awareness Week and continuing education of Gymnasium teachers, the institute is a steady component of the general public and educational landscape in Leipzig and its surrounding region. For issues of American culture and politics, the institute is an important counterpart for regional and national media, who regularly ask members of the institute for commentary concerning current proceedings in the US.  Main research  The programs of American Studies Leipzig focus especially on cultural and literary studies of the United States. This emphasis is supplemented by the institute's teaching of American English, regular guest lectures (such as the Fulbright Lecture Series), exchange programs with US universities (among others: Mount Holyoke College, University of Miami and Ohio University) and study trips to the US. Research at the institute focusses on Ethnic group, Gender, Immigration to the United States and Popular culture studies. Established 1997 and supported by donations, Frank Freidel Memorial Library features about 15'000 books and periodicals with a topical focus on the New Deal.

He ruled Fars until 869, when he was defeated and captured by Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, the Saffarid amir of Sistan.  Career prior to 868  A number of Muslim historians, including al-Ya'qubi and al-Tabari, wrote about 'Ali, but their accounts are not identical.Tor, p. 127 n. 40 = According to al-Ya'qubi = 'Ali first came to power in Fars in 863, when the provincial army revolted under his leadership. Fars at the time was one of several provinces that had been assigned to the Tahirid family, who held the important governorships of Khurasan and Baghdad. In response to the revolt, the governor of Baghdad, Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah appointed his fellow Tahirid 'Abdallah ibn Ishaq as governor of Fars and sent him to pacify the province. When 'Abdallah arrived, 'Ali at first submitted to him and was assigned to fight against a group of Kharijites near the border with Kerman. Soon, however, the army became disgruntled with 'Abdallah, who refused to pay their salaries; as a result, 'Ali was able to convince the troops to support him in a new uprising. 'Ali returned and attacked 'Abdallah, forced him to retreat and seized his possessions. The army of Fars then made 'Ali their amir.Tor, p. 126 = According to al-Tabari = Al-Tabari's chronicle notes that, in the year 864, the army of Fars revolted against 'Abdallah ibn Ishaq, looted his residence and forced him to flee; however it does not explicitly name 'Ali as being involved with this event.Al-Tabari, p. 27 It does not mention 'Ali until the events of 868 and 869, at which point he was serving as the caliphal governor of Fars; it also describes 'Ali as having previously been in the service of the Tahirids.Bosworth, pp. 143-4; Al-Tabari, p. 156  War with Ya'qub ibn al- Layth  In 868, war broke out between 'Ali and the amir of Sistan, Ya'qub ibn al-Layth. According to al-Tabari, 'Ali had written to the caliph al-Mu'tazz and requested that the governorship of Kerman be given to him. Kerman, like Fars, had been assigned to the Tahirids, but 'Ali claimed that Tahirid misrule had weakened their control over the province. According to the narrative, the central authorities did not trust him, but agreed to appoint him as governor of Kerman. At the same time, however, they also wrote to Ya'qub and gave him the same appointment, in the hopes that the two amirs would fight against each other and that one of them would be defeated.Tor, p. 127; Bosworth, p. 143-4; Al-Tabari, pp. 156-7. Ibn Khallikan, p. 304, adds that Ya'qub sent the caliph several gifts and in exchange asked for that the governorship of Fars be stripped from 'Ali and given to him Upon receiving his appointment, Ya'qub departed from Sistan to Kerman with the intention of establishing his authority there, when 'Ali learned of Ya'qub's advance, he dispatched an army under the command of Tawq ibn al-Mughallis to Kerman to defend the province. Tawq reached Kerman before Ya'qub, and for a while the two sides avoided engaging each other. Eventually, however, Ya'qub was able to defeat and capture Tawq. His victory allowed him to secure his hold over Kerman and it became another one of his provinces.Bosworth, pp. 143-5; Tor, pp. 127-8; al- Tabari, pp. 156-8; Ibn Khallikan, pp. 304-5 When 'Ali learned about Tawq's defeat, he feared that Ya'qub would press his advantage and invade Fars. He therefore mobilized his troops and set up his camp just outside Shiraz. When Ya'qub entered Fars, he and his army advanced to Shiraz and lined up to face 'Ali's forces. According to the biographer Ibn Khallikan, the resulting battle took place on April 21, 869; during the course of the fighting, Ya'qub's army broke through the enemy's front line, and soon 'Ali's men were abandoning the field in a panic and retreating back into Shiraz. 'Ali was captured and brought before Ya'qub, who ordered him bound and confiscated the possessions in his camp. Ya'qub then entered Shiraz and allowed his troops to plunder the residences of 'Ali and his partisans. After remaining there for a short time, Ya'qub abandoned Fars and returned to Sistan, and took with him 'Ali and a number of his commanders.Bosworth, pp. 145-7; Tor, pp. 128-30; al-Tabari, pp. 158-61; Ibn Khallikan, pp. 305-9 Following Ya'qub's departure, the central authorities sent al-Harith ibn Sima al-Sharabi to govern Fars.Bosworth, p. 147 'Ali's date of death is not mentioned by the sources. Ibn Khallikan, however, states that he was tortured on the orders of Ya'qub to the point that he went insane, and was ultimately imprisoned in a fortress in Kerman.Ibn Khallikan, p. 309  Notes   References  *Bosworth, C.

Plot Army sergeant Bill Cummings (Mark Stevens) is about to be discharged after service in World War II. He was a blue collar worker in civilian life and is seeking employment. As he fills out forms and speaks to personnel at the United States Employment Service, he thinks back on the life events that brought him to this point. Flashbacks show him at various times in his prewar life. He is shown meeting and marrying his wife Susan (Joan Fontaine) in 1938. Other flashbacks describe their hardscrabble life in a poor neighborhood of New York City during the Great Depression. He and various relatives are shown as frequently unemployed and having difficulty making a living. He and Susan's financial ups and downs are depicted, as are the humiliation of being supported by Susan's bookstore clerking job, and unfairly being prosecuted as a pornographer. At the conclusion of the film, he is shown being referred to a badly needed job interview, and that Susan is pregnant.

Director Berry and screenwriter Hugo Butler would both be caught in the Hollywood blacklist, and the uncredited writer Odets appeared as a HUAC friendly witness. Reception The New York Times reviewer called the film \\"a plotless succession of episodes,\\" and said \\"there may be some purpose in all this but we couldn't quite make it out‚Äîunless it is simply to demonstrate that unemployment is a very bad thing.\\" The critic said that Fontaine's performance as a Bronx housewife was unconvincing. Variety said the flashbacks make \\"it sometimes difficult to follow as a whole, but there can be no quarrel with the merit of presentation and acting of the individual sequences.\\" A Cincinnati Enquirer reviewer praised the performances and the film's \\"extraordinarily realistic touches,\\" though he noted a \\"somewhat involved story-telling method.\\" Time Out Film Guide said that \\"such strands as post-war optimism, the impact of neo-realism, the socialist convictions of director and chief writer (Butler), both blacklist-bound, can easily be picked out. But as ever when Hollywood tried to engage with everyday realities, the trade off came in glamourisation - syrupy music, Fontaine (as Stevens' wife) never looking less than a film star, and an idea of poverty that must have irritated many audiences on home ground, never mind in Europe.\\" =Reception= The film made a profit of $362,000.Richard B.

A bomb exploded without warning outside a furniture showroom on the Shankill Road in a predominantly unionist area, killing four civilians, two of them babies. It is widely believed that the bombing was carried out by members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in retaliation for the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) bombing of McGurk's Bar a week earlier, which killed 15 Catholic civilians. The bombing happened on a Saturday when the Shankill was crowded with shoppers, creating bedlam in the area. Hundreds of people rushed to help British Army troops and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) rescue survivors trapped under the rubble of the devastated building. According to journalist Peter Taylor, the bomb site was \\"reminiscent of the London Blitz\\" during World War II. The attack provoked much anger in the tight-knit Ulster Protestant community and many men later cited the bombing as their reason for joining one of the two main Ulster loyalist paramilitary organisations: the illegal UVF or the then-legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Four such men were Tommy Lyttle, Michael Stone, Sammy Duddy, and Billy McQuiston. The bombing was one of the catalysts that sparked the series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists, republicans and the security forces that made the 1970s the bloodiest decade in the 30-year history of the Troubles.Taylor, pp.90‚Äì93 The bombing The bombing took place in the heart of the loyalist Shankill Road At 12.25 on 11 December 1971, when the Shankill Road was packed with Saturday shoppers, a green car pulled up outside the Balmoral Furniture Company at the corner of Carlow Street and Shankill Road. The shop was locally known as \\"Moffat's\\" although Balmoral Furniture Company was its official name.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA‚ÄîInside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 8 One of the occupants got out, leaving a box containing a bomb on the step outside the front door. The person got back into the car and it sped away. The bomb exploded moments later, bringing down most of the building on top of those inside the shop and on passersby outside.The Troubles: A Chronology of the Northern Ireland Conflict magazine. Glenravel publications. Issue #8. pp.36-37, 51 Retrieved 27 January 2012 Four people were killed as a result of the massive blast, including two babies‚ÄîTracey Munn (2) and Colin Nichol (17 months)‚Äîwho both died instantly when part of the wall crashed down upon the pram they were sharing. Two employees working inside the shop were also killed: Hugh Bruce (70) and Harold King (29). Unlike the other three victims, who were Protestant, King was a Catholic.CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths‚Äî1971 Bruce, a former soldier and a Corps of Commissionaires member, was the shop's doorman and was nearest to the bomb when it exploded.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 7‚Äì8 Nineteen people were injured in the bombing, including Tracey's mother. The building, which was built in Victorian times, had load- bearing walls supporting upper floors on joists. It was thus unable to withstand the blast and so collapsed, adding to the devastation and injury count.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 7 The bombing caused bedlam in the crowded street. Hundreds of people rushed to the scene where they formed human chains to help the British Army and RUC free those trapped beneath the rubble by digging with their bare hands. Peter Taylor described the scene as \\"reminiscent of the London Blitz\\" in World War II.Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.90 One witness was Billy McQuiston, who had been walking down the Shankill with a friend when they heard the blast. Rushing to the scene, McQuiston later recounted what he saw and felt upon reaching the wrecked building: > Women were crying. Men were trying to dig out the rubble. Other men were > hitting the walls. One person was crying beside you and the next person was > shouting 'Bastards' and things like that. I didn't actually see the babies' > bodies as they had them wrapped in sheets, but the blood was just coming > right through them. They were just like lumps of meat, you know, small lumps > of meat. All these emotions were going through you and you wanted to help. > There were people shouting at the back, \\"Let's get something done about > this\\". To be perfectly honest with you, I just stood there and cried, just > totally and utterly numb. It wasn't until I got back home that I realised, > this isn't a game. There's a war going on here. These people are trying to > do us all in. They're trying to kill us all and they don't care who we are > or what age we are. Because we're Protestants, they are going to kill us so > we're going to have to do something here. The angry crowd at the scene shared McQuiston's dismay and anger against the IRA, whom they automatically held responsible for the bombing. They also sought to retaliate against any Catholic they happened upon. A Protestant man nearby made a remark about the bombing, and someone who overheard it mistook the speaker for a Catholic and shouted out: \\"He's Catholic!\\" A mob of about one hundred men and women ran towards him and began kicking and punching him until he was left unconscious. It took the RUC and British troops half an hour to rescue him from his attackers.The Troubles: A Chronology of the Northern Ireland Conflict. magazine. Glenravel publications.

Within a month of the bombing, the UDA had restructured, adopting a more military structure and establishing a thirteen-member Security Council under Charles Harding Smith to co-ordinate activity.McDonald & Cusack, p. 22 Michael Stone would go on to perpetrate the Milltown Cemetery attack in 1988, which was caught on camera. Another Protestant man, Eddie Kinner, had been at the scene following the explosion. He lived around the corner from Balmoral. He sought revenge against the IRA and later joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). He later spoke about his reactions to the Balmoral bombing in an interview with Peter Taylor: \\"On that occasion, if somebody had handed me a bomb to plant it anywhere you want in the Falls, I would have done it\\", adding that he had no qualms about taking somebody else's life.Taylor, pp. 91‚Äì92 Within a week of the attack, the UVF retaliated by planting a bomb at Murtagh's Bar on the Irish nationalist Springfield Road in west Belfast. A 16-year-old Catholic barman, James McCallum, was killed.Taylor, p. 93 Plaque commemorating the bombing on the side of Shankill Leisure Centre The building which housed Balmoral's Furniture Company was formerly \\"Wee Joe's Picture House\\", dating from the 1930s. Taking its name from \\"Wee\\" Joe McKibben, one of three owners of the cinema (which was nicknamed the \\"Wee Shank\\"), it was said locally that it cost a jam jar to get in on account of the fact that patrons could go to McKibben's other place of business, a grocery shop, and swap an empty jam jar for a ticket to the cinema.Paul Hamilton, Up the Shankill, Blackstaff Press, 1979, pg. 88 The edifice was demolished after the bombing. Although a youth on the Shankill had seen the green car and person who planted the device, the bombers were never apprehended nor was anyone ever charged in connection with the attack. The McGurk's Bar bombing was the catalyst that sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalist and republican paramilitaries that would help make the 1970s the bloodiest decade in the 30-year history of the Troubles. The Balmoral bombing was not the first paramilitary attack in the Shankill Road area. On 29 September 1971, the Four Steps Inn pub had been bombed by the Provisional IRA, resulting in the deaths of two men.Taylor, p.87 It would not be the last either. In August 1975, the Provisional IRA carried out a shooting and bombing attack against the Bayardo Bar on Aberdeen Street, which killed three men and two women - one aged 17. A deadlier attack took place on 23 October 1993 when a two-man IRA unit from Ardoyne carried a bomb into Frizzell's Fish Shop on the Shankill. The device detonated prematurely, killing one of the bombers and ten of the customers (see Shankill Road bombing).Taylor, p. 224 Balmoral as a company was also established as a target by this attack and in October 1976 its premises in Dunmurry were blown up in another bomb attack. There were no casualties. Three IRA volunteers were arrested not far from the scene of this attack with one, Bobby Sands, imprisoned for possessing a gun as a result.Richard English, Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA, Pan Books, 2004, p. 197 Sands' fellow hunger striker, Joe McDonnell, was also arrested following this incident.English, Armed Struggle, p. 198 Sands and McDonnell had jointly planned the bomb attack.

Born and raised in Corpus Christi, Texas, Layton moved to Austin in 1975 and joined the band Greezy Wheels. He later joined Vaughan's band Double Trouble in 1978. After forming successful partnerships with bandmates Tommy Shannon and Reese Wynans, Double Trouble recorded and performed with Vaughan until his death in 1990. Layton and Shannon later formed supergroups such as the Arc Angels, Storyville, and Grady. Layton is the drummer for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band. Early life and career Layton was born on in Corpus Christi, Texas. During his childhood, he lived in Mathis, Texas, a small community where his father owned a car dealership. After hearing Chubby Checker's version of \\"The Twist\\", Layton became fascinated with playing the drums. He moved back to Corpus Christi and acquired his first drum set at the age of 13. Layton graduated from W. B. Ray High School, where he was part of the school band. After attending Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, Layton moved to Austin on December 18, 1975, joining the band Greezy Wheels. Double Trouble and later career Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble (Layton to the left) in 1983 Layton's roommate, sax player Joe Sublett, recalls how Layton met Stevie Ray Vaughan: On September 10, 1978, Layton joined Vaughan in Double Trouble, taking the name from a song by Otis Rush. After Tommy Shannon replaced Newhouse in 1981, Double Trouble performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1982, where its performance caught the attention of Jackson Browne. The band's debut album, Texas Flood (1983), was recorded in Browne's studio and became a commercial success. The album was produced by John H. Hammond and sold more than half a million copies by the end of the year. Layton would continue to record and perform with Vaughan and Double Trouble until Vaughan's death on August 27, 1990. He said of Vaughan's death: \\"Stevie meant everything to me musically. His death was the worst thing that ever happened to me.\\" Following his death, Layton and Shannon formed the Arc Angels, with guitarists Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton. In 1994, they formed Storyville with David Lee Holt, David Grissom, and singer Malford Milligan. Layton and Shannon played on the 1994 album Something Inside of Me by Little Jimmy King. Layton appeared with Shannon in a tribute to Vaughan broadcast on Austin City Limits in 1995. Layton and Shannon also released their first solo album, Been a Long Time (2001), and featured many special guests such as Dr. John and Willie Nelson. In 2003, Layton formed Grady with leader Gordie (Grady) Johnson, and has worked with many other artists including Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Johnson, and Susan Tedeschi.

Oil on canvas, 117 x 80 cm. Jakob Gr√ºnenwald (30 September 1821, B√ºnzwangen ‚Äî 26 September 1896, Stuttgart) was a German genre painter and illustrator. Life Gr√ºnenwald was the eighth child of a family who worked a small farm. In 1840, he began his studies at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, where he studied history painting under Bernhard von Neher, who steered him towards religious themes. In 1853, he moved to Munich, where he worked with Anton Braith, Albert Kappis and Carl Spitzweg, among others. Gr√ºnenwald received numerous public contracts and, until 1881, participated in many exhibitions in Dresden, Berlin and the Munich Glaspalast. He created most of his best-known works in Munich and concentrated on genre painting. As interest in his work began to wane, he received an appointment to the Stuttgart Academy, through the mediation of his former teacher, Neher. He was head of the drawing department there from 1877 until his death. Among his students were Karl Bauer, Georg Jauss und Hermann Pleuer. As a member of the \\"Society for Christian Art in the Evangelical Church of W√ºrttemberg\\" he had a major influence on contemporary religious art. Unfortunately, Gr√ºnenwald's work later fell into oblivion, although many of his paintings were widely distributed as steel engravings. It wasn't until the 1980s, during a resurgence of interest in genre painting, that his works were rediscovered. Today, his works may be found in the Municipal Museum at G√∂ppingen, the Landesmuseum W√ºrttemberg and at his memorial in B√ºnzwangen.

It is loosely based on the fairy tale \\"The Fisherman and His Wife\\". Themes Grass said, \\"The Flounder is about women and food, but it is also about women and war, including what women have done against warunfortunately, mostly silence.\\" Regarding his view on the human sexes and its influence on the novel, Grass said, \\"Most women who read the book all the way through like it. Those in the women's liberation movement who say there is no difference between men and women don't like it. I like the differenceI hate those who don't like the difference between men and women.\\" The key theme of the book is of woman's historical contributions in both fact and fiction, ranging from the early goddesses of the matriarchial Stone Age society by the Vistula River, to the Grimm Brothers' fairy tale, \\"The Fisherman and His Wife\\", to the novel‚Äôs contemporary \\"women‚Äôs' libbers\\" (as phrased in the English translation). The Flounder plays a central role as agent and provocateur in the cause of one or the other sex throughout. Writing process Grass came up with the idea for the book while campaigning in the late 1960s for the politician Willy Brandt. He said that during the campaign, he was \\"constantly being bombarded by second-hand language.\\" He got an urge to write what would become The Flounder, and took five years to complete the novel. He rewrote the more than 500-page novel three times. Grass has said his structure of nine chapters was deliberate, to \\"pay homage to the nine months of pregnancy.\\" At the same time, he has acknowledged tweaking some aspects of radical feminism.Herbert Mitgang, \\"Grass on Men, Women, and 'Flounder'\\", New York Times, 25 November 1978, accessed 8 September 2014 Publication The novel was published in August 1977 through Luchterhand, with a first edition of 100,000 copies. One of Luchterhand's ways to market the book was to send out 4000 preview copies to selected people. Grass toured extensively with public readings of the book during the eight weeks leading up to the release; upon the publication date, Grass had read extracts for a total of 10,000 people. The book dominated the German bestseller chart for several months. By October 1977, nearly 250,000 copies had been sold. An English translation by Ralph Manheim was published in the United Kingdom and United States in November 1978. Reception William Cloonan of Boston Review wrote that The Flounder marks a new direction in Grass' writing, partially because it is not concerned with World War II like the author's previous books: > But Grass's other concerns, his strengths, and weaknesses, are very much in > evidence. Foremost among them is the tension between his pedagogical and > artistic instincts. The Flounder is Grass's teacher par excellence and with > him the question, hinted at in Local Anaesthetic, 'can one trust one's > teacher,' is explicit.\\" Cloonan also wrote: \\"With the Flounder, Gunter Grass > creates a character whose combination of intelligence, amorality, self- > irony, and curiosity makes him almost the equal of Oskar [in The Tin Drum]. > Indeed, there is much brilliant writing in The Flounder. For a writer justly > famous for extended humorous and grotesque scenes, Grass also has a flair > for one-liners. Herbert Mitgang of the New York Times noted that the novel was about \\"women, men and the state of the world\\" and since all are controversial, so was the reaction to Grass' novel. It defies an easy summary, as the narrator tells of his many lives as a husband, including as a lover to 11 women cooks. A reviewer for Kirkus Reviews argued that ‚Äúthe bulk and density can drown you. To Grass' credit, however, he's thrown himself totally into this novel (as he hasn't done in a while). Ambitious readers can plunge into this Hood-like phantasmagoria of the battle-of-the-sexes; all readers can stand on the shore and admire some of Grass' inventive ripples.‚Äù See also * 1977 in literature * German literature References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Category:1977 German novels Category:German-language novels Category:Novels based on fairy tales Category:Novels by G√ºnter Grass ","title":"The Flounder"},{"id":"34512528","text":"Joshua Beloya McNally (born February 20, 1991) commonly known as Joshua Beloya, is an American-Filipino football player currently playing as a striker for Global and the Philippines national team.

She was convicted of financial fraud and initially sentenced to death, but the sentence was overturned by the Supreme Court of China. On 21 May 2012 her sentence was reduced to death with a two-year reprieve, which was commuted to a life sentence in 2014. On 23 March 2018, her life sentence was further reduced to 25 years. Early life and career The eldest of four sisters, Wu Ying was born in May 1981 to a farmer's family in the village of Tangxia in Dongyang. After graduating from middle school in 1997, she studied accounting at a local vocational school, but dropped out after a year and a half to work at her aunt's beauty salon. Later she opened her own beauty parlour on Dongyang's West Street and claimed to have made huge profits selling sheep placenta extract, a popular anti-aging product in China. She also opened a car rental company in nearby Yiwu. Bense Group In 2005, Wu Ying founded the Bense Group in Dongyang, and in the following year registered 15 separate companies under the group with a total registered capital of 300 million yuan, and made high-profile donations of 6.3 million yuan to charities. Her sudden wealth and fame caused a sensation in the Chinese media and there were wild speculations about the source of her apparent wealth. In 2006, aged only 25, she was ranked by the influential Hurun Report as the sixth-richest woman and the 68th-richest person in China, with a net worth of 3.6 billion yuan (US$567 million). Trials and sentencing Wu Ying was arrested in February 2007 for illegal fundraising and fraud, and was tried in April 2009 at the Intermediate People's Court in Jinhua, a prefecture-level city that administers Dongyang. She was initially charged with illegal fundraising, with a maximum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment, but the charges were later changed to the more serious crime of financial fraud, which in China is punishable by death. The indictment alleged that between May 2005 and February 2007, Wu Ying had illegally raised 770 million yuan from the public by promising them high investment returns, and only 380 million yuan was recovered when she was arrested. Wu Ying's attorney Yang Zhaodong, however, contested that she merely borrowed the money from 11 of her friends and invested the funds in profitable businesses. In December 2009, the court found her guilty and sentenced her to death. Wu Ying appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Court, but on 18 January 2012, the provincial court upheld the conviction and the death penalty. Death penalty debate Wu Ying's death sentence had created an outpouring of sympathy from the public as well as official Chinese media, and ignited an enormous outcry criticizing the Chinese legal system for treating private citizens like Wu far more harshly than corrupt officials. Many have called for leniency and abolition of the capital punishment for economic crimes. In March 2012, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said at a news conference that Wu Ying's case should be carefully handled by the Supreme Court. His statement was interpreted as a call for rejecting Wu's death penalty. Sentence reduced Chinese law requires review and approval by the Supreme Court of all death sentences. On 20 April 2012, the Supreme Court announced its decision. While reaffirming the guilty verdict, the high court overturned the death penalty and sent her case back to the Zhejiang Provincial Court for re- sentencing. The decision was praised by Wu Ying's supporters and opponents of the death penalty. On 21 May 2012, her sentence was reduced to death with a two-year reprieve, which is usually commuted to a life sentence after two years. On 11 July 2014, her death sentence was commuted to a life sentence. „Ää‰∫ø‰∏áÂØåÂßêÂê¥Ëã±Ê≠ªÁºìÂáèÂàë‰∏∫Êó†Êúü„ÄãÔºåÊñ∞ÂçéÁ§æÔºå2014Âπ¥07Êúà11Êó•„ÄÇ On 23 March 2018, her life sentence was reduced to 25 years.

He additionally recorded with former Sons of Champlin bandmember and solo recording artist Tim Cain. Broadcasting career In 1980‚Äì81 Keilman produced radio commercials on the now-defunct Marin County rock station KTIM-FM. After attending Santa Monica College in the early 1980s as a broadcasting student where he was a newscaster on Santa Monica's KCRW, Keilman joined Fred Wallin as a co-host on the Los Angeles afternoon drive KFOX Sports Forum, work which included intensive coverage of the then Los Angeles Raiders football team.

Lynn Woolsey in May, 2016. In late 2003 Keilman challenged multi-term incumbent Al Boro for the mayor's seat in San Rafael, California. Keilman lost the race in which he expressed opposition to the local SMART train and a proposed Marin Municipal Water District desalination plant, and called for \\"making San Rafael a model city for renewable energy\\" as well as enacting a millionaire city tax. Keilman received over 2,000 votes in the election. Community activist After the electoral challenge to Mayor Al Boro, Keilman continued to speak out about the controversial SMART train and Boro's role in support of the project. Writing a 'Marin Voice' column in the Marin Independent Journal in 2006, he charged that Boro was in a \\"conflict of interest\\" regarding the train, as Boro was chairman of the train's board of directors. Keilman joined other activists as he spoke out against the Marin Countywide Plan before the county Planning Commission, saying the plan allowed overdevelopment and noting \\"Option 2 would allow hundreds of houses in the St. Vincent's/Silveira area. That's not what we want.\\" In 2009, Keilman wrote a column in the Marin Independent Journal supporting San Anselmo Councilman Ford Greene's stand against the disputed results of a tax vote in Marin's Ross Valley; the paper had previously noted his comments before the Marin County Board of Supervisors, with reporter Rob Rogers writing \\"This project feels like Florida in 2000,\\" said Keilman, a former mayoral candidate in San Rafael. \\"It feels like somebody tried to pull a fast one on the voters.

Design and development O'Neill intended to modify the Aristocraft II six-place homebuilt with a radial engine. Eventually a clean sheet design was drawn up based on a bush pilot survey in Alaska. The Magnum is a single-engine, strut-braced, high-wing aircraft with an uncommon dual-main, four-wheel landing gear. The fiberglass gear legs support castoring wheels in the front, allowing for conversion to floats and providing support when the tail section is swung open for cargo loading. The fuselage is constructed from welded steel tubing, with aluminum skin. The engine cowl is sourced from a Cessna UC-78. The wings have full-span flaps, and spoilerons and are designed to fold like those of a Fairchild FB-2C. The fuel tank is mounted under the cockpit and can be released to reduce fire risk during emergency landings. Post flight-testing modifications resulted in changes to the landing gear layout, spoileron airflow control and engine cooling. The Magnum was demonstrated at the EAA Airshow in 1984. In 1996, O'Neill folded the O'Neill aircraft company due to low interest and funding for further development. The prototype was sold in 1996 for an intended turboprop conversion.

She was born on November 25, 1700, in Bonyh√°d, Hungary, and died on July 29, 1759, in Fogaras, Hungary (now FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, Romania). Family and marriages Kata Bethlen, as a member of the notable Bethlen family, was active in Hungary's cultural and intellectual life. She was the niece of the Chancellor of the Principality of Transylvania, Mikl√≥s Bethlen, and in her second marriage wed to the son of a later Chancellor, Mih√°ly Teleki. Her first marriage had been politically motivated, her Roman Catholic half-stepbrother being forced on her at the age of 17. The antagonism between her Protestantism and the Catholicism of her husband's family affected her strongly. Her husband's family denied her access to her children and her daughter's malicious teasing was mentioned in her writing. She remarried after the death of her first husband and was happier than with the first, but her husband and their children died early, after which Kata Bethlen assumed the epithet \\"orphaned.\\" Bethlen became mistress of her husband's large estates and active in fostering education in Transylvania. Much of this she described in her writings. As a patron of P√©ter Bod, the Protestant scholar and publisher, she supported printing and scholastic reform. Bod, her chaplain in 1743‚Äì1749, assembled for her one of the most important libraries of that period, which included over 500 manuscripts. However, this library was to be destroyed by fire in 1847. Written works She published her writings as V√©delmez≈ë, er≈ës paizs (Protective, Strong Shield, 1759) and Bujdos√°snak eml√©kezetk√∂ve (The Memoirs of her Exile, 1733). She also collected work that includes her letters: Gr√≥f Bethleni Bethlen Kata √©let√©nek maga √°ltal val√≥ r√∂vid le√≠r√°sa (A Short Description of the Life of Countess Kata Bethlen Written by Herselfm written 1759, published 1762). These mirror her personal troubles, but also reflect political struggles of the day and the duties and tasks of leading families in them. Her letters present her as clever and skillful. She encouraged industrial development on her estates, established gardens and nurseries to propagate better stock, acquired a paper-mill and glassworks, and employed numerous artisans, including embroiderers. She studied natural science to help her counteract the effect of natural disasters and persuade tenants to adopt progressive farming practices. Further, she learned medicine and pharmacology to better minister to the needs of her community and contributed generously to the advance of learning by establishing schools and scholarships, particularly the education of girls, which she felt sadly neglected. Her diary was primarily a personal response to the pressures her first husband's family put on her to convert, as a Protestant unhappily married to a Catholic. Her autobiography can be called a fine example of Baroque literature. Legacy Kata Bethlen is a good representative of Hungarian Baroque, who unites the literature of her day with that of the 19th-century period of Reform. Her works blend in an interesting way traditional meditative lyrics and the popular genres of her time with her strongly Puritanical views. Her style draws on the memoirs of J√°nos Kem√©ny and Mikl√≥s Bethlen, work closely related to Francis R√°k√≥czi. Her letters compare with those of Mme de S√©vign√© and others at the Court of Louis XIV.

Upon retirement, she was appointed Nevada commissioner of consumer affairs and, after two years, in 1992 was named chief of the Las Vegas News Bureau, a post she held for a decade. Early life and education Borders moved with her family from Kentucky to Nevada in 1940 when she was 4 years old. She attended the historic Fifth Street School, and graduated in 1954 from Las Vegas High School (now a performing arts academy) in downtown Las Vegas, where she reported for the school newspaper. On a Harold's Club scholarship, she graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno's school of journalism with a bachelor of arts degree.Las Vegas High School Alumni Association, Myram Borders (Class of 1954) Career During her senior year at UNR, she interned at United Press International in Reno and, upon graduation, went to work for UPI full-time, later transferring to the San Diego bureau, then Los Angeles and, ultimately, to Las Vegas as the bureau manager, from the time it was mob influenced into the large corporate era of the 1990s. Borders was the first female wire service manager in the western United States. After leaving UPI, she opened the first full-time Las Vegas office for Gannet Newspapers before accepting her appointment as Nevada commissioner of Consumer Affairs. After that short stint, Borders headed the Las Vegas News Bureau before retiring in 2002. While with UPI, Borders covered the Beatles' arrival in Las Vegas in 1964 when they performed at the Las Vegas Convention Center. She also broke the news story of Elvis Presley's 1967 wedding to girlfriend Priscilla Beaulieu at the Aladdin hotel-casino wedding chapel after getting a tip. She went to the Aladdin Hotel Casino and waited all night. At 8 o'clock in the morning, Borders noticed a Nevada Supreme Court justice walking into the casino and asked if he was there to marry Elvis, and he confirmed it. She was first reporter to file the story about the wedding. In 1969, she wrote a review of Presley's opening night at the International Hotel in Las Vegas for UPI. In the article titled \\"Elvis Swings Into Action in Vegas,\\" she wrote, \\"During the performance, Presley went through 15 selections including some of his top records, 'Blue Suede Shoes,' 'Love Me Tender,' 'Jailhouse Rock,' and 'Heartbreak Hotel.' He also strummed his guitar and slithered through his recent recording, 'In The Ghetto'.\\"Elvis Collections In 1981, Borders was the first reporter on the scene of the car bombing on Sahara Blvd. involving mob connected bookmaker and casino operator Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal. \\"As I drove by Tony Roma's and Marie Callender's, I heard this huge boom,\\" Borders told the Las Vegas Sun. \\"A guy was getting out of a car, sort of smoky and his hair was standing on end.\\" As she approached, she told the paper, Rosenthal shouted, \\"They're trying to kill me, they're trying to kill me!\\" Rosenthal survived the assassination attempt, while suffering burns, because of a steel plate factory installed under the driver's seat to correct balancing issues in his 1981 Cadillac Eldorado. During her career with UPI, Borders also covered the Watts riots in Los Angeles, the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, the indictment of Sirhan Sirhan, and the Charles Manson murder trial. In 2015, Borders was featured as a \\"Nevada Maker\\" as part of its KLVX Documentaries series. In 2019, upon receiving the Nevada Press Association award in Carson City, Nevada, she told the audience, \\"Nevada was and is an ideal place to be a news reporter. ...

The film pertains to a personal fight between an American and a Serb war veteran. Daugherty's script caught the attention of producers after winning the 2008 Script PipelineScript Pipeline Screenwriting Competition. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box office flop.  Plot  During the Bosnian War, American troops witness atrocities and then shoot Serb soldiers they hold accountable for them. In present-day Belgrade, Serbia, former Scorpions soldier Emil Kovaƒç (Travolta), who survived the shootings, meets his informant to retrieve a file on American military veteran and former NATO operative Colonel Benjamin Ford (De Niro). Meanwhile, Ford has retreated to a cabin somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains, to forget the war. Now a recluse, he meets Kovaƒç, posing as a European tourist, during a hunting trip. The two men become friendly, until Kovaƒç reveals his true identity. Intent on revenge, he initiates a gory game of cat-and-mouse with Ford. The latter is badly injured but is quick to rebound. After a showdown, Kovaƒç is overpowered by Ford. They reach a peaceful compromise, however, after understanding each other's predicament. Kovaƒç quietly returns to Serbia, while Ford visits his son, to make up for missing his grandson's baptism.

It was being considered by John Travolta and Nicolas Cage as a project to follow up on their film Face/Off and by director John McTiernan as a directing vehicle. Subsequently renamed and modified to take place in modern-day Appalachia, and co-financed and co-produced by Corsan, Nu Image and Millennium Films, filming began on January 16, 2012, in the Appalachian Mountains of north Georgia. Major filming was scheduled for Tallulah Gorge State Park and Black Rock Mountain State Park.

His father having died during James's first year, the family moved to Edinburgh, where he was educated. In 1811 he began to study for the law, but his health was poor. Wilson joined the Wernerian Society when just 17. In 1816 Wilson visited the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Paris. He later returned to Paris to purchase Louis Dufresne's collection of birds for the museum of Edinburgh University; and helped to arrange them. In 1819 he visited Sweden, soon after which symptoms of lung disease appeared, and he resided in Italy during 1820‚Äì1821. In 1824 he married Isabella Keith, and settled down at Woodburn, Dalkeith near Edinburgh, where he wrote and worked on scientific pursuits. Losing his wife in 1837, he took a winter residence in George Square, Edinburgh. He purchased Woodville in south Edinburgh in 1838.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1838 In 1827 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Robert Jameson. From 1850 until death he was curator for the society. In 1841, with Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, he made a series of excursions round the coasts of Scotland, at the request of the Fisheries Board, to study the natural history of the herring. Other trips followed at intervals between 1843 and 1850, and fishing excursions inland. In 1854 he was offered but declined the chair of natural history in the Edinburgh University, vacated by the death of Edward Forbes. He died at Woodville HouseEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1856 on Canaan Lane in Morningside, Edinburgh on 18 May 1856. He is buried in Dean Cemetery in west Edinburgh. The grave lies in the small central south section facing onto the main central path. It stands immediately in front of the more distinctive grave of his brother John Wilson. Family In 1824 he married Isabella Keith (d.1837). Their daughter, Marianne (Marion) Rae Wilson married James Alexander Russell FRSE. John Wilson who wrote as \\"Christopher North\\" was his eldest brother; Matthew Leishman was his cousin, and lived nearby; Henrietta Wilson the writer was his niece, daughter of his brother Andrew. His niece, Henrietta Margaret Sym Wilson (1810‚Äì1863) lost her parents and came to live with him at Woodville. She was a novelist of some note.ODNB: James Wilson - Henrietta Wilson She is buried with him in Dean Cemetery. Evolution Wilson was one of the first to have used the term \\"evolution\\" in the context of biological speciation.√ñrstan, Aydin. (2014). Two early nineteenth-century uses of the term \\"evolution\\" to denote biological speciation. Archives of Natural History. Vol. 41, No. 2: pp. 360-362. In 1830, he used this term in a paper on the history of goat and sheep, he wrote: :Whatever dreams the mystical imaginings of some modern philosophers may have given rise to regarding the origin of species, and the gradual evolution of one form of animal life as connected with or consequent upon another, it is not a bad rule, though a tolerably old fashioned one, to believe that in the origin of species nothing was left entirely to such casual intercourses, but rather that every thing was not only divinely planned, but directly performed, by the same simple though Omnipotent fiat which gathered together the waters under the heaven, and made the dry land appear, with all the beautiful, infinitely varied, and most harmoniously adapted inhabitants of either element.Wilson, James. (1830). On the Origin and Natural History of the Sheep and Goat. Quarterly Journal of Agriculture 2: 354-376. Wilson's use of the term predated Charles Lyell in 1832. Wilson had rejected the evolution of species for creationism.

Its aim was to coordinate the actions of the Resistance movement in Greece, including the establishment of a joint headquarters under the aegis of the British GHQ Middle East . The negotiations were begun by the British military mission in March 1943 as an attempt to avoid a repeat of the clashes between the Communist-controlled ELAS, by far the largest armed guerrilla organization, and the other groups. In addition, the British were concerned with presenting the Germans with the real possibility of an Allied invasion of the Balkans, and an increased and coordinated guerrilla effort was vital for this (Operation Animals, cf. also Operation Mincemeat and Operation Barclay). On 6 June, representatives from ELAS (Colonel Stefanos Sarafis and Andreas Tzimas), EDES (Colonel Napoleon Zervas and Komninos Pyromaglou) and the British mission (Eddie Myers and Christopher Woodhouse) assembled in the village of Liaskovo. The negotiations lasted on-and-off for a month, until the agreement was signed on 5 July. EKKA, which at the time did not have any armed force in the field due to its forcible disarmament by ELAS, signed the agreement on 18 July, represented by Colonel Dimitrios Psarros and Georgios Kartalis. The Panhellenic Liberation Organization (PAO), another nationalist group active in Macedonia but also hostile to ELAS, was also considered for later inclusion. In the event, the agreed joint headquarters, where ELAS had the majority, failed to coordinate the guerrillas' movements, best evidenced following the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, when each organization tried to get as much as it could from the spoils of the Italian army of occupation. ELAS seized the majority, and clashes between the groups began again in October 1943 with an attack on EDES by ELAS forces.

Biography Born in Kosovo, Gashi moved to Austria where he studied Communication Sciences and Political Sciences in the University of Vienna. After completing his degree, he went on to begin his career as an election supervisor with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1997, he became the Election Officer, Head of Field Office in Brcko Federation. Later that year, he moved to Croatia, in the capacity of Human Rights Monitor, and spent the next year in various posts as part of OSCE missions in the Balkans. During the Kosovo War, Gashi worked with the Kosovo Verification Mission as a Public Information Liaison Officer, OSCE Secretariat in Vienna. After the war, he resumed his work with OSCE, and contributed to plans for institution-building, media policy and elections and registration. From 2011 until 2014, he was Minister for Environment and Planning. In 2000, he contributed to the International Crisis Group, United Nations Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), European Stability Initiative, etc. From 2005 to 2008, Gashi worked at the office of the Deputy Prime Minister/Ministry of Local Government Administration in Kosovo. Initially, he chaired the working group on decentralization, and participated as a senior adviser at all meetings during the Vienna Negotiations. Meanwhile, Gashi also chaired the WG on Return within the Direct Dialogue process with Belgrade. In June 2010, Gashi became Deputy Minister of European Integration. He held this position until January 2011, when he was proposed to become the Minister of Environment, following the national elections of 2010. From 2011 until 2014, he was Minister for Environment and Spatial Planning. During Dardan Gashi‚Äôs mandate, the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning has managed to approximate the legislation of the Republic of Kosovo with the European Union. Regarding the air pollution, MESP has forced large corporations, also known as the largest polluters (Kosovo Energy Corporation, Ferronikel, Sharrcem, etc.) to install filters to prevent further air pollution. In November, 2011, at the request of the Minister Gashi, the Kosovo Government stopped the illegal sand and gravel exploitation in the rivers basins of Kosovo. This decision was applauded by citizens and NGOs as one of the best decisions necessary for the protection of environment. Since then, the illegal exploitation of inert materials has stalled, resulting in investments by MESP and municipalities for the reconstruction of river banks. In the field of spatial planning, Minister Gashi, in collaboration with USAID, was committed to reforming the Law on Construction. After reforming the application process for a construction permit, Kosovo‚Äôs ranking in Doing Business Report has increased from 177 to 144, in 2012.

It is the largest private sector superannuation fund in PNG. In 2016, NASFUND reported net assets of PGK4.22 billion, representing a 28% growth on 2015. Compulsory superannuation contributions in PNG were introduced in 1982. Employees are required to contribute a minimum of 6% of their salary to a superannuation fund and employers of over 15 persons are required to contribute 8.4%. The Chief Executive Officer of NASFUND is Ian Tarutia OBE. The Fund is supervised by a board of nine directors, which is chaired by Hulala Tokome. Three of the directors are independent and six are representatives of the seven shareholding bodies: * Employers Federation of PNG; * Manufacturers Council of PNG; * Rural Industries Council of PNG; * Chamber of Mining & Petroleum; * PNG Chamber of Commerce; * PNG Banks & Financial Institutions Workers Union; and * PNG Trade Union Congress. The investment functions of NASFUND are outsourced to BSP Capital (BCAP), with fund administration managed by Kina Investments and Superannuation Services (KISS). The National Provident Fund (NPF) The National Provident Fund (NPF) of Papua New Guinea was established in 1980. However, following severe financial losses in the 1990s as a result of fraud, corruption and mismanagement, the NPF was privatised in 2002 and its assets divested to NASFUND. =Financial Concerns and Restructuring= In the late 1990s concerns were raised about NPF's financial liabilities given its exposure to the PNG government, real estate and minerals as well as several allegations of fraud and mis-management. Between 1996 and 1997, the NPF had increased its debt by approving illegal loans from both domestic and foreign commercial banks as well as engaging in two fraudulent projects; the attempted purchase of the Waigani land and the construction of the NPF tower, which further contributed to its losses. Subsequently in early 2000, NPF fund managers announced a write down of 50 percent in all member contributions made before December 1999, equating to almost PGK114 million. However, a special audit report commissioned into the NPF revealed that the total losses were actually in excess of PGK155 million. As a result of these findings the government requested a formal Commission of Inquiry into the financial dealings of the NPF and the allegations of fraud. A number of measures were introduced to curb the NPF's losses through the National Provident Fund (Financial Reconstruction) Act 2000, which included the allocation of a PGK1 million annual grant. Commission of Inquiry into Frauds The Commission of Inquiry into the NPF was established in April 2000, with wide terms of reference, to investigate all the equity investments and purchases of the NPF, as well as the allegations of fraud and mismanagement, after the findings of the special audit report were delivered. The Commission was chaired by former National and Supreme Court Judge, Tos Barnett, who had previously chaired the government inquiry into the Papua New Guinea Forestry Authority. Barnett was assisted by commissioners Donald Manoa and Lady Wilhelmina Siaguru. The Commission, which reported its findings in November 2002, found that a number of NPF's senior officers had been in breach of duty and had, in some instances, committed criminal offences. =Waigani Land Fraud= The Commission of Inquiry reported that in 1999 NPF Chairman, Jimmy Maladina had influenced the NPF to purchase a piece of land in Waigani, which he secretly held an interest in, at an exorbitantly inflated price. Maladina had acquired the lease for the Waigani land in 1997, via his company Waim No.92 Pty Ltd, at a reduced price of PGK1.4 million, instead of the market value of PGK2.87 million. The Commission found that Maladina negotiated this reduction by bribing the chairman of the Lands Board, Ralph Guise, and the Lands Minister, Viviso Seravo. Following his appointment as Chairman of NPF in January 1999, Maladina with NPF's Legal Advisor, Herman Leahy, arranged for NPF to purchase the rights to the Waigani Land, by purchasing a 100 percent shareholding in Waim No.92 for an inflated price of PGK10 million. Maladina had not declared that he held an interest in Waim No.92. However, when news of the proposed acquisition was published in the national media, the ensuing outcry against the exorbitant price led Prime Minister Sir William Skate, to force NPF's withdrawal from the purchase. =NPF Tower Fraud= The Commission of Inquiry also found that Jimmy Maladina, Herman Leahy and Peter O'Neill had profited by PGK2.5 million in a fraudulent scheme involving Japanese construction firm, Kumagai Gumi. Kumagai Gumi was contracted by NPF to build what is now known as the Deloitte Tower in Port Morseby, in 1997. The project was beset by delays and overran its initial schedule, which when coupled with the devaluing of the Kina in 1998 and 1999, reduced the profitability of the project for Kumagai Gumi and led it to register a devaluation claim against NPF. Maladina agreed with Kumagai general manager, Shuichi Taniguchi, that he would ensure that NPF pay out a PGK5.8 devaluation settlement provided that PGK2.5 million of this then be paid to Maladina, by way of commission. The monies were paid as agreed and the PGK2.5 million was shared between Maladina, O'Neill and Leahy. The Deloitte Tower is now owned by NASFUND and was valued at PGK108 million in 2010. =Referrals by the Commission of Inquiry= As a result of the Inquiry, Maladina was referred to the Commissioner of Police, but fled to Australia to avoid arrest. The government of PNG applied for the extradition of Maladina from Australia, but he returned to PNG voluntarily. Maladina was subsequently found guilty of misappropriation and sentenced to 8 years in prison (see State v Maladina [2015] PGNC 146; N6049). This custodial sentence was suspended by the court. The Commission also referred then Treasurer Peter O'Neill to the Commissioner of Police for his involvement in both the NPF Tower fraud and the Waigani land case. O'Neill was brought before the Waigani Committal Court in 2005 and charged with misappropriation, but the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence.

When playing with CR Vasco da Gama, he won the championship of Rio de Janeiro. He also played for FC Barcelona, Sporting CP and SC Corinthians Paulista. The most successful period of his career was in the 1930s with the French club Olympique Marseille. In Brazil, he is also considered to be the person who popularised the use of gloves by goalkeepers. Life = Brazil, Spain and Portugal = Vasco 1929: back: Tinoco, Brilhante, It√°lia, Jaguar√©, Fausto, Mola; front: Pascoal, Oitenta-e-Quatro, Russinho, M√°rio Mattos, Santana Jaguar√©, who had no formal education, worked as a stevedore at the port of Rio. In his leisure time he enjoyed physical exercise and played football on the grounds of his neighbourhood of Sa√∫de, a quarter close to the port, which is still marked today by the simple accommodations of the local labourers. There he impressed Espanhol, a defender with CR Vasco da Gama, who took him to a training session of his club in 1928. He impressed the other club members and established himself immediately as the new goalkeeper, after he had been told how to write his name so that he could register on match sheets. In 1929, he was part of the team that won the championship of Rio de Janeiro. His most prominent teammates were the elegant midfielder Fausto dos Santos, considered the best of his era in Brasil, and Moacir Siqueira de Queir√≥s Russinho, who were both to play for Brazil at the World Cup of 1930. Jaguar√© circa 1930, with typical mariner's cap Jaguar√© was also called up for the national team but, between 1928 and 1929, he played in only three unofficial matches against club teams from Scotland and Argentina.Marcelo Leme de Arruda: Sele√ß√£o Brasileira (Brazilian National Team) 1923‚Äì1932, RSSSF- Brasil (Matches 49 to 51), 28 February 2009. Between June and August 1931, Vasco da Gama, reinforced with several players such as Nilo and Carvalho Leite from Botafogo FC, and also players from Rio, went on a trip to Europe. This was only the second trip to Europe by a Brazilian club, following that of CA Paulistano in 1925. In twelve matches in Portugal and Spain, against teams such as: FC Barcelona, FC Porto, S.L. Benfica and Sporting CP in Lisbon, the team of Vasco, coached by Harry Welfare, won eight times. Jaguar√© and Fausto dos Santos must have made an impression in the two matches against FC Barcelona, as both were given contracts to play for the club as professionals. In Brazil, at that time, football was still an amateur sport. However, Jaguar√©, soon nicknamed Ara√±a Negra (\\"black spider\\"), and dos Santos, could only be used in about a dozen friendly matches, as the rules of the association prevented foreigners from participating in official matches. FC Barcelona attempted to convince both players to naturalize and take up Spanish citizenship, but both refused, despite the excellent financial considerations offered.M√°rio Filho: O negro no futebol brasileiro, 1947, p. 191. Filho used D√©mosthenes Magalh√£es to demonstrate that Brazilian players preferred to abandon their names rather than their nationality for the sake of playing professionally in Europe. Dos Santos moved on to Switzerland and Jaguar√© returned to Brazil. It is reported that, at some point around this time, he turned up to train at his old club Vasco da Gama sporting goalkeeper gloves. This is considered to be the first use of gloves by a goalkeeper in Brazil. After he left Vasco to play professionally in Europe, however, he was no longer well regarded at the club and in Rio de Janeiro in general. To keep afloat financially, he travelled around with so-called \\"combinados\\", ad hoc teams, and allowed himself to be used as a figurehead for the marketing of various festivities and other events.M√°rio Filho: O negro no futebol brasileiro, 1947, p. 193. From 1934 to 1935 he guarded the goal of SC Corinthians Paulista in S√£o Paulo, where he ended up being replaced by Jos√© Hungarez, the first foreigner in the ranks of the Corinthians. Fernando Giudicelli was one of the first Brazilians to opt for a career as a professional player in Europe in an era when football in Brazil was still an amateur sport. He also acted as a player agent helping South American footballers secure engagements at European clubs. In mid-1935, he convinced Jaguar√© to join him playing for a club in Italy alongside the defender Marins Alves de Ara√∫jo Viana (\\"Vianinha\\"), who had probably also played previously for the Corinthians or for CA Paulista. After their voyage across the Atlantic, their first port of call was Lisbon, where they got news of the commencement of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Because of this they decided not to continue the journey to their intended destination. However, they were soon taken on by Sporting CP, the first Brazilians to play in club history.Jaguar√©, ex-meta barcelonista quer√≠a ir a Italia y si e queda en Lisboa, El Mundo Deportivo, 23 October 1935, p. 1. Giudicelli was to play only two matches for the Lisbon side, then moved on to play for Real Madrid and in France. Jaguar√© stayed a bit longer with Sporting, winning the city championship alongside Vianinha. After a total of seven matches for Sporting, Jaguar√© found himself replaced by Jo√£o Azevedo, who was to remain goalkeeper of the club for the next one and a half decades. = Glory days in France = In mid 1936, he joined the French first division club Olympique Marseille, where he replaced Laurent Di Lorto, who moved to FC Sochaux-Montb√©liard, then a major force in French football. After Jaguar√©'s first season with Olympique, then coached by the Hungarian J√≥zsef Eisenhoffer, alongside some exceptional players from three continents, such as: Aznar, Ben Barek, Ben Bouali, Kohut, Weiskopf, and Zatelli, they won the national championship ‚Äì the first such title in club history. In the following season, Marseille could not defend the title, finishing second behind Sochaux. But they won the Cup of France, defeating FC Metz 2-1 in the final. In Jaguar√©'s last season with the club, 1938/39, Marseille once again finished second in the league, this time behind FC S√®te. In 1937/38 he made history, scoring a penalty goal in S√®te, securing the final result of 1‚Äì1. To date, this is the only goal by an Olympique Marseille goalkeeper in an official match. Later on in the same match, he stopped two penalty kicks by opponents, which hit the Marseille goal posts four times. He often vociferously encouraged opposing attackers to shoot, calling \\"chuta, chuta!\\". These and other eccentricities contributed to Jaguar√©, who was nicknamed \\"El Jaguar\\" in Marseille, becoming a lasting part of club folklore. After that season he left France, possibly in expectation of the approaching war. On his way back to Brazil, he stopped over in Porto, where he played for the first division club Acad√©mico FC. However, he did not feel very happy there and had difficulty integrating. Altogether he played nine times for the club, including two matches in the league.Paulo Cezar: O Brincalh√£o Jaguar√©: Primeiro goleiro a marcar um Gol, Liga Borborema de Futsal, 2011. = Back in Brazil = In Rio de Janeiro, he reportedly still played for a brief period for S√£o Crist√≥v√£o FR, a smaller club in the north of the city, which had won a championship in 1926. Jaguar√©'s circumstances were already in a state of decline; his small savings from his time in Europe were soon used up, and his consumption of alcohol had increased. He tried to return to his job as a stevedore. On the job, his fellow workers did not find his stories about his time as a great footballer credible. Jaguar√© soon disappeared.

Life  Julius FrederickJulius Frederick was the third son of the Duke Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg and his wife Sibylla of Anhalt. He grew up with his parents and siblings in Montb√©liard. After his father took up government of W√ºrttemberg in 1593, Julius Frederick lived in Stuttgart. He participated in military operations in the Alsace and in the War of the J√ºlich Succession. He travelled extensively, including journeys to Asia Minor, Malta, and Ephesus, and, in 1615, to Lapland. On 28 May 1617, he was awarded the Lordships of Weiltingen and Brenz an der Brenz and a share of Heidenheim plus an annual allowance of . He chose Weiltingen as his residence. On 24 November 1617, he was engaged to Anna Sabina von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg (1593‚Äì1659, daughter of John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg). He married her on 11 December 1618 in S√∏nderborg. After the marriage, they lived in Brenz for a while, then moved to Weiltingen. In 1631, he led the regency for his nephew Eberhard III. That same year, he joined the League of Leipzig. After the bloodless Cherry War later that year, he had to leave the League under the terms of the Peace of T√ºbingen. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden advanced into southern Germany, he raised troops again and joined Gustavus Adolphus. This led to a dispute with the Government, the Estates, and his co-regent (Barbara Sophie of Brandenburg, the mother of Eberhard III). In 1633, he renounced the regency in W√ºrttemberg.

VFTS 102 is a star located in the Tarantula nebula, a star forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The peculiarity of this star is its projected equatorial velocity of ~ (about ), making it the fastest rotating massive star known alongside VFTS 285 (). The resulting centripetal force tends to flatten the star; material can be lost in the loosely bound equatorial regions, allowing for the formation of a disk. The spectroscopic observations seem to confirm this, and the star is classified as Oe, possibly due to emission from such an equatorial disk of gas. This star was observed by the VLT Flames Tarantula Survey collaboration using the VLT, Very Large Telescope in Chile. One member of this team is Matteo Cantiello, an Italian astrophysicist who emigrated to the United States and is currently working at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at University of California Santa Barbara. In 2007, together with a few collaborators, he predicted the existence of massive stars with properties very similar to VFTS 102. In its theoretical model, the extreme rotational speed is caused by the transfer of material from a companion star in a binary system. After this \\"cosmic dance\\", the donor star is predicted to explode as a supernova. The spun-up companion instead is likely to be launched out of the orbit and move away from its stellar neighbors at high speed. Such a star is called a runaway. VFTS 102 fits this theoretical model very well, being found to be a rapidly rotating runaway star and lying close to a pulsar and a supernova remnant. Other scenarios, like a dynamical ejection from the core of the star cluster R136, are also possible.

The postseason was contested by four of the six teams participating in the regular season, with the teams with the best winning percentages qualifying. In the semi-finals, the Adelaide Bite were the first team eliminated, defeated by the Sydney Blue Sox three games to one in Adelaide in the minor semi-final series. The Perth Heat became the first team to qualify for the championship series, by defeating the Melbourne Aces three games to one in the major semi-final series, held in Perth. The Aces defeated the Blue Sox in Melbourne, winning the preliminary final series three games to two. The Heat defeated the Aces for the second postseason series in a row, winning the championship series two games to one, to become ABL Champions in back‚Äìto‚Äìback seasons.  Format  At the conclusion of the regular season, the postseason involved the teams in a three-round structure. The first- and second-place teams played each other in the major semi-final, the winner of which proceeded directly to the championship series and the loser to the preliminary final. The winner of the minor semi-final between the third- and fourth-place teams also qualified for the preliminary final, while the loser was eliminated. Likewise, the winner of the preliminary final qualified for the championship series, the loser being eliminated. Unlike the previous postseason, where each round consisted of a best-of-three game series, both of the semi-finals and the preliminary final will be played out over best-of-five game series. The championship series once again used a best-of-three game format.  Bracket  = Qualification = The Perth Heat were the first team to clinch a postseason position when they defeated the Brisbane Bandits in Perth on 8 January, and then clinched a first place finish in their next game when they defeated the Canberra Cavalry in Canberra on 12 January. The three remaining positions in the postseason, and the teams that would take them, were not determined until the last game was finished. The Melbourne Aces finished a half-game ahead of a four-way tie between the Adelaide Bite, Brisbane Bandits, Canberra Cavalry and Sydney Blue Sox to secure the remaining spot in the major semi-final. The Bite and the Blue Sox finished third and fourth respectively after the ABL's tiebreakers were applied. Until only a few hours before their final game of the season, Cavalry officials believed that regardless of the result in the game they would progress to the postseason based on their interpretation of the tiebreaking procedures. However they were informed by the League that was not the case. Canberra's interpretation was that once Adelaide were determined as having finished third, a separate tiebreaker would be held between themselves, Brisbane and Sydney and excluding Adelaide, which would have result in Canberra progressing. The actual process used was to continue with the next level of the tiebreaker as Brisbane and Sydney as they were still level after using the head-to-head records between the four teams. As Sydney had won their season series with Brisbane 5-4, Sydney claimed the final postseason position, Brisbane were left in fifth place, and Canberra in sixth.

The show debuted on January 24, 2012, and its first season is scheduled to end on February 23, 2012, with the season championship. The show is hosted by MLB Network anchor Matt Vasgersian. The show's focus is baseball trivia. Format The show features 32 contestants (each of whom works for one of the 30 Major League Baseball teams as well as one from MLB.com and one from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum) in a bracket-style tournament for up to USD 45,000 for their teams' designated charities. Each episode's winner receives USD 5,000 for the charity and the season champion receives USD 25,000 for the charity. The season runner-up's charity receives USD 15,000. Gameplay The gameplay starts with the \\"Lead-off Home Run\\" question. The player who buzzes in gets the chance to answer. If the player is correct, they score the first run and control of a board with 8 categories to be used in the first 8 rounds (\\"innings\\"8 or 9 \\"innings\\" per episode). If the player who buzzes in is incorrect, their opponent gets the first run and control of the board. For the first 8 innings, the player in control picks a category and the subject of a list-based question is given. Players alternate giving answers in the category until one either gives an incorrect answer, repeats a previously given answer, or runs out of time trying to come up with an answer. At that point, the other player wins the inning and is given the option to use their one \\"Big Inning\\" (each player in each episode gets one) and gives four more answers to earn 2 runs. The number of runs for winning the inning outright is determined by how deep the players went in the inning. After 8 innings, if one player is ahead of his opponent by more runs than can be scored in the ninth inning, the \\"mercy rule\\" goes into effect and no ninth inning is played. In the ninth inning, the two players would bid on the number of correct answers they can give in the final category. If the player who wins the bidding gives the number of correct answers that they bid would score the runs and, if they bid enough, would win the game. If the ninth inning ends in a tie, one more buzz-in question is asked. If the player who buzzes in gets the answer correct, they get the run, win the game, and advance in the tournament. The other player scores and wins if the buzz-in player answers incorrectly. The first tournament was won by Shane Demmitt, representing the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, who defeated Ben Baumer, representing the New York Mets, in the final.

Background Yurt√ßu began his journalistic career in 1966 as a reporter at the Ekspres. Over the next twenty-five years, he worked at another half-dozen papers as a reporter or columnist, including ', ', ', ', ', ', ', and '. At ' in 1971, published a series of articles on the torture of political prisoners, bringing him national recognition. In 1975, he was made an honorary member to the National Writers' Union of Turkey. At the time of his imprisonment, was serving as the editor of ' (English: \\"Free Agenda\\"). The paper was particularly known for its extensive coverage of the ongoing conflict between the Turkish Armed Forces and the PKK, a Kurdish guerrilla army, which was being downplayed by mainstream Turkish media. During Yurt√ßu's tenure as editor, the paper's circulation grew to more than 100,000, a record for an independent Turkish paper. 1993 arrest and imprisonment In 1993, the Turkish government arrested Yurt√ßu, stating that the reporting of √ñzg√ºr G√ºndem violated Articles 6, 7, and 8 of its Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of its Penal Code. Yurt√ßu had not personally written the articles in question‚Äîonly served as the paper's editor‚Äîand noted following his imprisonment that \\"Nobody in the world has been sentenced to so many years in prison for articles others have written\\". He was found guilty of the charges and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment, and after his December 1994 appeal was rejected, he began serving his sentence. The court also ordered √ñzg√ºr G√ºndem shut down. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists soon selected Yurt√ßu as an \\"emblematic case\\" for Turkish press freedom, at a time when Turkey had more imprisoned journalists than any other nation. Former journalist hostage Terry A. Anderson led the CPJ's campaign to free Yurt√ßu, hoping to win his freedom first as a \\"concession\\" and then use it as leverage to press for the freedom of other imprisoned Turkish journalists. Reporters Without Borders also campaigned for his release, asking European journalists to adopt Yurt√ßu through their \\"godfather\\" system. One of these, a reporter from the French newspaper Le Figaro, was critical of the reaction of other Turkish media to Yurt√ßu's detention, stating that: > Turkish journalists lag behind their Western counterparts in expressing > their support for Yurtcu‚Ä¶ If it hadn't been for the [Reporters Without > Borders] campaign, no one would be interested in his case.\\" On 14 August 1997, the Turkish parliament unanimously passed a limited amnesty for Yurt√ßu and several other jailed editors. Yurt√ßu was released from Sanjay prison the following day. Upon leaving prison, Yurt√ßu was given a bouquet of flowers by the prison prosecutor. International recognition During Yurt√ßu's imprisonment, Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience. In 1996, The Committee to Protect Journalists awarded him an International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". Reporters Without Borders awarded him the Reporters Without Borders/Fondation de France Prize the same year. In 2000, Yurt√ßu was a finalist to be selected as Turkey's representative for the International Press Institute's 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past half-century. Though the committee eventually selected Milliyet editor Abdi ƒ∞pek√ßi, committee member Raymond Louw later described the choice between ƒ∞pek√ßi and Yurt√ßu as causing \\"much heartburn\\".

Instead of being placed on a stove for the duration of the cooking period, food is instead heated to a hot enough temperature then transferred to the Wonderbag, which uses the principle of thermal insulation to continue cooking, and keeps food warm without needing additional fire or heat. Working on the principle of thermal cooking, the Wonderbag is estimated to save up to 30% of the total fuel costs associated with cooking with Kerosene (\\"paraffin\\") alone. In developing countries there are numerous advantages for the product, as it immediately helps ease deforestation of natural reserves, and it frees up those who would spend their time gathering the extra wood for fire fuel. Designed by Durban, South Africa-based entrepreneur Sarah Collins of Natural Balance, and poverty activist Moshy Mathe, the Wonderbag is aimed at societies where fuel is expensive or time-consuming to gather. As of January 2012, over 150,000 Wonderbags were in use in South Africa, with the manufacturers and partners such as Unilever intending to promote the use of the device worldwide. over 650,000 have been distributed in \\"South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya, and Syrian refugee camps in Jordan.\\"  History  Sarah Collins developed the idea for the Wonderbag during power outages in South Africa in 2008. Anna Pearce describes in her book \\"Simply Living - The Story of the Compassion and the Wonderbox\\" from 1989 how the old idea of the hayboxes turned into polystyrene filled cushions - The Wonderbox - to cook in South Africa () Wonderboxes were also distributed beginning as early as 1976, while not a new invention, the wonderbag is an innovative take on an old design. The original Wonderbox was designed and produced by Shirley Buys (nee' Woodbridge) in Durban in 1976, based upon the Hay Box design used in her childhood in war- time England. Shirley trained as a patternmaker and designed the inverted oversized 'beanbag' containing recycled polystyrene chips in a polyester- cotton fabric bag and lid within a corrugated cardboard box and personally marketed it across Zululand between 1976 and 1980. Compassion of South Africa, a non-sectarian Christian action group opposing Apartheid, and the particular assistance from Brigid Oppenheimer facilitated Shirley's design and marketing and published a comprehensive recipe book https://thermalcooker.wordpress.com/2008/07/26/wonder-box-recipe-booklet/with a lot of graphics to help illiterate users follow the recipes.http://foodstorageandsurvival.com/building-a-wonderbox-style- insulated-cooking-box The design was deliberately not patented and Compassion of South Africa asked to be recognised in the sharing of the recipe book. Shirley manufactured the Wonderbox in her workshop in her Morningside Durban home for over 3 years before Compassion established several other manufacturing facilities across South African, and shared the design freely.  Design  The Wonderbag consists of an inner layer of insulation containing recycled polystyrene balls, with an outer, drawstring covering of polyester- cotton blend textiles. The manufacturers expect that in time the polystyrene (which is non-biodegradeable) will be replaced with a polyurethane blend.  Use  To use the Wonderbag, first a cooking pot is heated as normal on a stove until it reaches the required cooking temperature. At this point, the pot is removed from the stove and placed in the bag, where due to the insulation the receptacle remains near the stovetop temperature for an extended period. Rice, for instance, may be cooked by heating in a pot of water for two minutes until the water boils and then placing in the Wonderbag for another hour, while for a meat dish the stovetop time is twenty minutes and the bag time five hours.  Fuel savings  Due to the reduction in fuel used, the Wonderbag is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to half a ton per year if used three times a week.

In the traditional two‚Äìparty communication game, introduced by ,. two players, P1 and P2 attempt to compute a Boolean function : f(x_1,x_2):\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n\\\\to\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\},\\\\ x_1,x_2\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{n'},\\\\ 2n'=n Player P1 knows the value of x2, P2 knows the value of x1, but Pi does not know the value of xi, for i = 1, 2\\\\. In other words, the players know the other's variables, but not their own. The minimum number of bits that must be communicated by the players to compute f is the communication complexity of f, denoted by Œ∫(f). The multiparty communication game, defined in 1983,. is a powerful generalization of the 2‚Äìparty case: Here the players know all the others' input, except their own. Because of this property, sometimes this model is called \\"numbers on the forehead\\" model, since if the players were seated around a round table, each wearing their own input on the forehead, then every player would see all the others' input, except their own. The formal definition is as follows: k players: P1,P2,...,Pk intend to compute a Boolean function : f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n):\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n \\\\to \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} On set S = {x1,x2,...,xn} of variables there is a fixed partition A of k classes A1,A2,...,Ak, and player P1 knows every variable, except those in Ai, for i = 1,2,...,k. The players have unlimited computational power, and they communicate with the help of a blackboard, viewed by all players. The aim is to compute f(x1,x2,...,xn), such that at the end of the computation, every player knows this value. The cost of the computation is the number of bits written onto the blackboard for the given input x = (x1,x2,...,xn) and partition A = (A1,A2,...,Ak). The cost of a multiparty protocol is the maximum number of bits communicated for any x from the set {0,1}n and the given partition A. The k-party communication complexity, C(k)A(f), of a function f, with respect to partition A, is the minimum of costs of those k-party protocols which compute f. The k-party symmetric communication complexity of f is defined as : C^{(k)}(f)=\\\\max_AC^{(k)}_A(f) where the maximum is taken over all k-partitions of set x = (x1,x2,...,xn).  Upper and lower bounds  For a general upper bound both for two and more players, let us suppose that A1 is one of the smallest classes of the partition A1,A2,...,Ak. Then P1 can compute any Boolean function of S with A1 + 1 bits of communication: P2 writes down the A1 bits of A1 on the blackboard, P1 reads it, and computes and announces the value f(x). So, we can write: : C^{(k)}(f)\\\\leq\\\\bigg\\\\lfloor{n\\\\over k}\\\\bigg\\\\rfloor+1. The Generalized Inner Product function (GIP). is defined as follows: Let y1,y2,...,yk be n-bit vectors, and let Y be the n times k matrix, with k columns as the y1,y2,...,yk vectors. Then GIP(y1,y2,...,yk) is the number of the all-1 rows of matrix Y, taken modulo 2\\\\. In other words, if the vectors y1,y2,...,yk correspond to the characteristic vectors of k subsets of an n element base-set, then GIP corresponds to the parity of the intersection of these k subsets. It was shown that : C^{(k)}(GIP)\\\\geq c {n\\\\over4^k}, with a constant c > 0\\\\. An upper bound on the multiparty communication complexity of GIP shows. that : C^{(k)}(GIP)\\\\leq c {n\\\\over2^k}, with a constant c > 0\\\\. For a general Boolean function f, one can bound the multiparty communication complexity of f by using its L1 norm. as follows:. : C^{(k)}(f) = O\\\\Bigg(k^2\\\\log(n L_1(f))\\\\Bigg\\\\lceil{n L_1^2(f)\\\\over2^k}\\\\Bigg\\\\rceil\\\\Bigg)  Multiparty communication complexity and pseudorandom generators A construction of a pseudorandom number generator was based on the BNS lower bound for the GIP function.

UBC iSchool is an internationally ranked, multi- disciplinary school, ranked first in the world for graduate education in library and information management based on 2019 and 2020 QS ranking.QS Rankings. https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university- subject-rankings/2019/library-information-management https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject- rankings/2020/library-information-management Academic Programs UBC iSchool offers four master's degrees and a doctoral degree. Students can also specialize in the First Nations Curriculum Concentration if they want to work with, or within Indigenous knowledge organizations. UBC iSchool. \\"First Nations Curriculum Concentration.\\" https://slais.ubc.ca/programs/specializations/fncc/. Accessed August 14, 2018. The Master of Archival Studies and Master of Library and Information Studies degrees are 48-credit programs, consisting primarily of coursework, with an optional 12-credit thesis option. The Master of Archival Studies degree program follows the guidelines for archival education published by the Association of Canadian Archivists and the Society of American Archivists. The degree program began in 1981 and was the first stand-alone degree program in archival science in Canada or the United States.Eastwood, Terry. \\"Archival Research: the University of British Columbia Experience.\\" The American Archivist 63 (Fall/Winter 2006): 243-257. The Master of Library and Information Studies degree is accredited by the American Library Association. The degree was first offered in 1995 and superseded the Master of Library Studies, which had been offered since 1971. Prior to that, the school offered a one-year Bachelor of Library Science.About UBC iSchool. https://slais.ubc.ca/about/about-the-ischool/highlights/ \\"Highlights.\\"] Accessed August 14, 2018. The Dual Master of Archival Studies/Master of Library and Information Studies program enables students to earn both the MAS and MLIS degrees within three to five years, following the completion of 81 credits. The Master of Arts in Children's Literature is a 30-credit interdisciplinary program, composed of courses from the departments of English, French, Language and Literacy Education, Theatre and SLAIS. The Doctor of Philosophy in Library, Archival and Information Studies program was introduced in 2003, with Archival Studies and Library and Information Studies streams. Research Research is clustered in three core areas: management and preservation of digital records, creation and use of cultural materials, and digital information systems and information interaction. The International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) Project focuses on the authenticity of born-digital records in records management programs and archives. The Centre for the Investigation of Financial Electronic Records (CiFER) studies issues relevant to the management of financial records, including risk management, security and e-discovery. The Digital Information Interaction Group (DiiG) brings together researchers and students engaged in the study of human interaction with digital information objects, collections of digital media, and digital information systems. = New Media = At the iSchool, a number of faculty do research in the new media space: Internet research, online social networks, e-learning, new media literacy, youth and new media, e-books, social media, open data and government, user engagement, social tagging, researchers on GRAND (Graphics, Animation and New Media), as well as faculty associated with the Faculty of Art's Bachelor of Media Studies. = Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) = HCI is necessarily an interdisciplinary field, engaging researchers who design, build, test, evaluate and examine the impact of new computer implementations for individual, group and community use across levels of skill, ability, and facility with technology. It addresses multiple contexts from work to learning and includes both fixed and mobile technologies and applications.http://hci.ubc.ca/about-hciubc/ = Cultural Heritage = Collection, preservation, access and use in library, archival and museum contexts, as augmented and challenged by digitization, digital production (‚Äòborn digital‚Äô materials), participatory culture, and access through contemporary media. Cultural Heritage Management addresses what in the cultural realm will be retained, by whom, in what manner, and with what access (i.e. whose history will be digitized, retained and made available). Research addresses both traditional and newly emerging contexts. It includes new access protocols and technologies for physical and digitized cultural artifacts held in traditional institutions, documentation, preservation, and sustainability of cultural knowledge and practices. For example, professors and students from the iSchool at UBC work with the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre and others to support the Indigitization program, which provides funding and training for Indigenous communities and organizations to digitize cultural heritage materials. = Records and Information Management = Archival science is concerned broadly with the creation and preservation of representations of transactions (i.e., records and archives) that can provide information and evidence about past activities of individuals and organizations. Archival Science explores the theoretical and practical conditions that lead to, or work against, creation and preservation of persistent and trustworthy records and archives. It also touches on issues of representation, openness, transparency, privacy, security, accountability, internal control, compliance and risk and risk management. = Children and Young Adult Literature and Services = This research depends on a multi-disciplinary approach bringing an understanding of child development, cognition, literacy, and literary analysis to bear on creative and critical evaluation of children's literature and young adult literature in traditional and new media formats.http://macl.arts.ubc.ca/ References External links * UBC iSchool (Library, Archival and Information Studies) * InterPARES Project * DiiG * CiFER Category:University of British Columbia Category:Information schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1961 Category:1961 establishments in British Columbia Category:American Library Association accredited library schools ","title":"UBC School of Library, Archival and Information Studies"},{"id":"34514114","text":"Dream Whip is a powder that is mixed with milk and vanilla to make a whipped dessert topping.

They are said to appear on days of the noon moon such the kaijitsu (29th or 30th day) of the seventh month of the lunisolar calendar when the wind is weak, in the Yatsushiro Sea and the Ariake Sea. Furthermore, they can be seen in modern times, but they have been determined to be an atmospheric optical phenomenon. Summary The phenomenon occurs several kilometers out from the shore in open water. First, one or two flames (called \\"oyabi\\" (Ë¶™ÁÅ´, lit. \\"parent-fire\\")) will appear. These will split off to the left and right and multiply, eventually producing anywhere from several hundred to several thousand flames in a row. They are said to span four to eight kilometers. It is believed that the greatest number of shiranui can be seen at the lowest tide, within two hours of 3:00AM. They are said to be invisible from the water's surface and visible up to ten meters above the surface. If one attempts to approach them, they will appear to get farther away. They were formerly believed to be the lamps of the Dragon God, and nearby fishing villages would prohibit fishing on days when shiranui were seen. According to the Nihon Shoki, the Hizen no Kuni Fudoki, and the \\"Higo no Kuni Fudoki\\", when Emperor Keiko conquered Kumamoto in southern Kyushu, they advanced using the shiranui as a landmark. In his journey to expand the Yamato ≈åken, he saw inexplicable spots of moving fire, shiranui, in the Ariake Sea and the Yatsushiro Sea (also called the Shiranui Sea). When he told local gozoku about these sightings, the gozoku replied that they did not know of this fire. It was thus named \\"shiranu hi\\" (\\"unknown fire,\\" which eventually was slurred into \\"shiranui\\"), and the area was named , now known as Kumamoto Prefecture. History In 1835, Nakashima Hiroashi wrote a book entitled On the Shiranui: From time immemorial, the Gulf of Shimabara, (near Ariake Sea), Japan, has been famed for Shiranui, the unknown fire, which appears from time to time. The phenomenon occurs twice a year, about 30 September and 24 February, from some time after midnight until the approach of dawn. Sometime the light is a large ball of fire rising from the surface of the sea to a height of 60 feet; sometimes it is a line of pale red, fiery globes drifting and down the tide.Collection [1983:148] An unidentified Australian newspaper Hypotheses # Reflection of star lights # Luminous jellyfish # Fire from undersea active volcano # Light of fishing boats In the Taish≈ç era, Shiranui attracted the attention of many people, including scholars and newspapermen, who attempted to explain the phenomenon scientifically, and have been explained as a type of mirage. There was a large scale investigation with two ships and more than 50 people in the Ariake Sea in 1916. However, they reported conflicting data and no scientific clarification was reached.Suisan Jiho 1916 featuring Shiranui,by Nagasaki Prefecture Fishery World. Collection [1983:84-177] According to one theory from the Sh≈çwa era by Machika Miyanishi, professor of Kumamoto Higher Technical School and Hiroshima Higher Technical School, who made extensive scientific studies and wrote eight papers, including two English papers, the time when shiranui appear is the time when the temperature of the sea is the greatest in the year, and the tide would sink about 6 meters, resulting in a mudflat and sudden radiative cooling, and overlapping with the land formation at the Yatsushiro Sea and the Ariake Sea, the lights of the boats that would depart to get the fish of the tidelands would get refracted. This theory is seen as having merit even in the modern era, and Miyanishi Machika, of the high industries of Kumoto and a professor from the Hiroshima Higher Technical School, researched this as his specialty. According to him, the shiranui are fires for luring fish at night (isaribi), their flickering and their alliance and rupture, helped with optical illusions, results in it being seen as mysterious flames.ÂÆÆË•ø[1943:ÊñáÁåÆÈõÜ310] The meteorologist Sakuhei Fujiwhara wrote Atmospheric Light Phenomena in 1933, but in it, he wrote that he did not know the cause of shiranui, and due to some who profited from delighting sightseers, he pointed out the possibility that they are from noctiluca.Ëó§ÂéüÂí≤Âπ≥„ÄéÂ§ßÊ∞ó‰∏≠„ÅÆÂÖâË±°„ÄèÊó•Êú¨Áèæ‰ª£Ê∞óË±°ÂêçËëóÈÅ∏ÈõÜÁ¨¨4Â∑ª 2010 Â§ßÁ©∫Á§æ (ÊóßËëó ÈâÑÂ°îÊõ∏Èô¢ 1933) Tairi Yamashita, Professor at Kumamoto University, made extensive studies of Shiranui using modern instruments with the assistance of students. He concluded that \\"Shiranui is an optical phenomenon resulting from light going through the complicated distributions of clumps of air with different temperatures and getting refracted. Therefore, the source of these lights are fires from private houses and fires used for luring fish, and so on. When these conditions are met, the same kind of phenomenon can be seen in other places and days. For example, road mirages, mirages in general, and heat shimmer are the same type of phenomena.‰∏çÁü•ÁÅ´Ë≥áÊñôÂèéÈõÜÂßîÂì°‰ºö[1993:457] Also, Nobuyuki Marume, in the collection of essays, \\"Shiranui,\\" published many photographs under the title \\"Changes of Shiranui with the Passage of Time from Shiranui Town towards the Direction of Amura.\\"‰∏çÁü•ÁÅ´Ë≥áÊñôÂèéÈõÜÂßîÂì°‰ºö[1993:6ÊûöÁõÆ] Machika Miyanishi, professor of Kumamoto Higher Technical School and Hiroshima Higher Technical School, made extensive scientific studies and wrote eight papers, including two English papers. His conclusion was: the light source of Shiranui was that of fishing boats. Large tideland forms lumps of air of different temperatures on special days, and by the voltex movement of air lumps, the light appears as deformed fluctuation in images of light.A study of Shiranui. Miyanishi Machika. Dainippon Shuppan Kabushiki Kaisha. 1943. Tairi Yamashita, Professor at Kumamoto University, made extensive studies of Shiranui using modern instruments with the assistance of students. He concluded that there is a very complex distribution of heated air lumps and cold air lumps which constantly change. Light from distant sources repeatedly fluctuates, and either increases or decreases or disappears. In some cases, light is split. These changes appear to the observer changing greatly and irregularly. Under the same conditions, Shiranui may appear in other seasons. A study of Shiranui. Tairi Yamashita. 1994. Ashi Shobou.

Div.\\" () is an infantry regiment of the Hellenic Army recently (2013) reduced in size from a brigade. The brigade was formed on 31 March 1998 when the 15th Infantry Division was reduced in size as part of a force restructuring in the Hellenic Army.  History  On 31 March 1998, after a Hellenic Army force restructure, the 15th Infantry Division was reduced to a brigade-level formation and renamed as the 15th Infantry Brigade (). It evolved into a motorized infantry role in 2011 and, as a result, was renamed the 15th Motorized Infantry Brigade \\"PYXOS\\" (). The honorific Pyx√≥s (), a Byzantine settlement on the western peninsula of Lake Prespa (near the town of Vrontero), was given to the brigade in recognition of its historic defense of the area as the 15th Infantry Division. On 6 November 2012, in anticipation of an upcoming defense review and its expected disbandment as a combat formation, the brigade commemorated its 72 years of service with a ceremony in Argos Orestiko. The occasion also included a remembrance ceremony for the 112 officers and 5812 enlisted soldiers who lost their lives in its (and, primarily, the 15th Infantry Division's) service. In April 2013 KYSEA decided the disbandment of the brigade as part of a new force structure for the Hellenic Army. However, within months, it was decided that the brigade would eventually be reduced to the level of a regiment. The brigade was officially reorganized and renamed the 15th Infantry Regiment \\"XV Inf. Div.\\" (), on 13 November 2014 and placed under the command of the NDC-GR. Emblem and Motto The emblem of the original 15th Infantry Division - a labrys- wielding griffin (), symbolizing strength, speed and vigilant guard - was carried-over to the 15th Infantry Brigade in 1998. The brigade's motto is This Number Is Sufficient (). The phrase was attributed to Leonidas when he was in charge of guarding the narrow mountain pass at Thermopylae with just 7,000 Greek men in order to delay the invading Persian army. He was asked why he had come to fight such a huge host with so few men. Leonidas answered, \\"If numbers are what matters, all Greece cannot match a small part of that army; but if courage is what counts, this number is sufficient.\\" ().Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, 225c.8-9.

Established for the first time briefly in 1915‚Äì1916, it was re-established in 1940, during the Greco-Italian War. The division distinguished itself in the war, where it took part in some of the most significant battles of the conflict. It was disbanded after the Battle of Greece, re-established after liberation in 1945 and subsequently fought in the Greek Civil War. It remained active in the Kastoria, Grevena and Florina areas until 1998, when it was reorganized and renamed as the 15th Infantry Brigade. History =World War I= The 15th Infantry Division was formed for the first time in 1915, following the Greek mobilization on 10 September 1915, in response to the mobilization of Bulgaria. The new formation was headquartered at Thessaloniki, while its units were recruited and formed in the Aegean islands: the 43rd Infantry Regiment at Lesbos, the 44th Infantry Regiment at Chios, and the 45th Infantry Regiment at Samos. These units were shipped to the wider Thessaloniki area by the end of September, and the full division became part of the V Army Corps in October. The division was disbanded following the demobilization of the Greek Army in May 1916. =Greco-Italian War= The 15th Infantry Division was reformed on 6 November 1940 when the 4th Infantry Brigade was expanded and augmented by personnel conscripted from the Kastoria and Grevena regions, following the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War. Both the brigade and the newly formed division were commanded by Colonel Agamemnon Metaxas. The newly formed division, now composed of three Infantry Regiments (28th, 33rd, and 90th) with artillery support (XV Mountain Artillery Regiment), was attached to the III Army Corps - which was, in turn, under the operational command of the Western Macedonia Army Section - and tasked with the defence of the northern flank of the Albanian front. On 14 November 1940, the 15th Infantry Division engaged and captured Italian positions on Hill 1480, also known as \\"Ivan's Rampart\\", as part of the Battle of Morava‚ÄìIvan. The capture of the hill gave the 15th Infantry Division a strategic position overlooking the pass at the Devoll river crossing near the village of Cangonj. During the second phase of the battle (17‚Äì20 November 1940), the division secured the crossing. This success allowed Greek forces in the south to concentrate on the expulsion of Italian forces on the Morava heights, and eventually capture the town of Korytsa on 22 November 1940.Military History Magazine (œÄŒµœÅŒπŒøŒ¥.

On 7 December 1940, the 15th Infantry Division moved on towards Pogradec and relieved a reconnaissance force from the 13th Infantry Division, which had secured the village on 30 November 1940. As part of a major push to secure Greek positions (13 December 1940 - 6 January 1941), the division was subsequently placed under the command of the II Army Corps and moved to the P√´rmet District, north of K√´lcyr√´, where it encountered the Italian 7th Infantry Division. On 8 January 1941 Italian forces, who had control of many of the surrounding peaks, attacked units of the 15th Infantry Division that had taken-up positions around Taronine. The 90th Infantry Regiment engaged Italian forces on Mali i Taronit (also known as Mali Taronine) on 10 January 1941, near the K√´lcyr√´-Tepelen√´ road. The success of the attack was strategically significant because it secured the northern flank of the Greek forces engaged in the Capture of Klisura Pass. Under the command of Colonel Christos Gerakinis, the regiment captured the hill with a bayonet charge, suffering 42 killed (including Major Dimitrios Kyriazis, one of its senior officers) and 161 wounded. Between 12 January 1941 and 17 January 1941, the 15th Infantry Division's attacks on positions of the Italian 7th Infantry Division inflicted such heavy casualties that it forced an Italian retreat.John Carr, \\"The Defence and Fall of Greece 1940-1941\\", p. 120 Significantly, the 90th Regiment's repeated attacks during heavy winter storms on the Dras-e-Kais hill, the village of Kaitsa, and Mali Nisitse, saw the capture of most of the Italian 77th Regiment, including its commander Colonel Menigetti and his command staff. On 2 February 1941, elements of the 15th Infantry Division under now-Major General Agamemnon Metaxas captured Height 802 and the nearby town of Bub√´s, northwest of Klisura. During the Battle of Trebeshina, on 13 February 1941, the division supported the 5th Cretan Division during its capture of the 1,805-metre (5,921-ft) northern peak of Mal Sh√´nd√´lli, before advancing their line a further 5 km (3 miles). Subsequent engagements saw the two divisions take heights 1647, 1260, and 1178. The 15th Infantry Division lost 2,000 killed, wounded or missing during the battle. Their advance was eventually stopped by strong Italian resistance at Tepelen√´. By the end of the Greco-Italian War, the division had lost 1,363 soldiers killed, and nearly three times that number wounded or missing. The 15th Infantry Division was disbanded with the Greek capitulation following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941. =Greek Civil War= The 15th Infantry Division was re-established on 15 May 1945, and participated in the Greek Civil War as part of the Royal Hellenic Army's II Army Corps. On 14 June 1948, the division took part in the failed Operation \\"Crown\\" (), a major offensive against Communist forces entrenched in the Grammos mountains. After 40 days of close fighting, the numerically outnumbered DSE forces managed to punch through the II Army Corps' lines and flee towards Vitsi. On 29 January 1949, the 15th Infantry Division, along with the A and B Raider Squadrons and the 39th Infantry Regiment, successfully recaptured the town of Karpenisi after bitter fighting against two DSE divisions, which suffered heavy losses. From 10 August 1949 to 30 August 1949, the division was involved in the second and third phases of Operation \\"Torch\\" (), the campaign to dislodge DSE forces from the Grammos-Vitsi mountains. These operations resulted in the defeat of DSE forces and the end of the Civil War.Patria Magazine (œÄŒµœÅŒπŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ∫œå PATRIA), Vol. 19, \\"ŒìŒ°ŒëŒúŒúŒüŒ£ - ŒíŒôŒ§Œ£Œô 1949 : Œü ŒïŒòŒùŒôŒöŒüŒ£ Œ£Œ§Œ°ŒëŒ§ŒüŒ£ Œ£Œ•ŒùŒ§Œ°ŒôŒíŒïŒô Œ§ŒóŒù ŒöŒüŒúŒúŒüŒ•ŒùŒôŒ£Œ§ŒôŒöŒó ŒëŒ†ŒïŒôŒõŒó\\" (Greek), September 2009 =Cold War and after= From 1962, the division was placed under the command of the I Army Corps, and with its headquarters in Kastoria, the 15th Infantry Division - consisting of five Infantry Battalions, one Armoured Squadron and one Artillery Squadron - was tasked with the defence of the prefectures of Grevena, Florina and Kastoria, manning 24 border outposts from Lake Prespa to Grammos. By 1989, the division consisted of the following units. *51st Infantry Regiment, based at Grevena *53rd Infantry Regiment, based at Kostarazi *90th Infantry Regiment, based at Argos Orestiko *XV Field Artillery Squadron, based at Argos Orestiko The division was reduced to a brigade-level formation on 31 March 1998 and renamed as the 15th Infantry Brigade. Emblem and Motto The emblem of the 15th Infantry Division is a labrys-wielding griffin (), symbolizing strength (lion's body), speed (eagle's wings) and vigilant guard (labrys ready to strike). The division's motto was This Number Is Sufficient (). The phrase was attributed to Leonidas when he was in charge of guarding the narrow mountain pass at Thermopylae with just 7,000 Greek men in order to delay the invading Persian army. He was asked why he had come to fight such a huge host with so few men. Leonidas answered, ‚ÄúIf numbers are what matters, all Greece cannot match a small part of that army; but if courage is what counts, this number is sufficient.‚Äù ().Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, 225c.8-9.

A founding member, and the first secretary, of both the Wernerian Natural History Society (1808‚Äì49) and the Caledonian Horticultural Society (1809‚Äì49), he is mainly remembered today for having endowed the Neill Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Neill' works include A Tour Through Some of the Islands of Orkney and Shetland (1806), which caused much public debate at the time, due to its descriptions of the economic misery of the islanders. He also authored the Gardening article in the seventh edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. This article was subsequently expanded and published as a separate book under the title of The Fruit, Flower, and Kitchen Garden, which was popular and ran through several editions. When the Nor Loch was drained in 1820, Neill was commissioned to plan the scheme of planting of 5 acres of land, which is now West Princes Street Gardens. This included the planting of 77,000 trees and shrubs. The rosaceous genus Neillia is named after Neill. Life He was born in Edinburgh on 25 October 1776, and spent his life there. He became the head of the large printing firm of Neill & Co., of Edinburgh, but during the last 30 years of his life he took little active part in its management. Early in his career he devoted his spare time to natural history, especially botany and horticulture. The Wernerian Natural History Society was established in 1808, and in 1809 the Caledonian Horticultural Society was founded. Neill was the first secretary of both societies, holding the latter post for forty years. View of Canonmills Cottage Garden, near Edinburgh, from Gardener's Magazine, July 1836. Neill's residence at Canonmills Cottage (in Canonmills, then near the city of Edinburgh, now a suburb) was open to visitors; and his garden was noted, with William Brackenridge as head gardener before he moved to Berlin.Gardener's Magazine, July 1836, p. 333‚Äì41; Google Books. He was Fellow of the Linnean Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and honorary LLD of the University of Edinburgh. Plan of Canonmills Cottage Garden, near Edinburgh, from Gardener's Magazine, July 1836. He served as President of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1842‚Äì43. Death and legacy A short time before his death he became enfeebled by a stroke of paralysis, and after several months of suffering he died at Canonmills on 3 September 1851, and was buried in Warriston Cemetery, on the western wall in the extreme south-west corner of the original cemetery, just west of the archway to the southern extension. His tombstone states that he was \\"distinguished for literature, science, patriotism, benevolence, and piety\\". The memorial was restored by the Friends of Warriston Cemetery 2014/2015. He died unmarried, and among his various charitable bequests was one of ¬£500 to the Caledonian Horticultural Society to found a medal for distinguished Scottish botanists or cultivators (now the Dr Patrick Neill Medal), and a similar sum to the Royal Society of Edinburgh for a medal to distinguished Scottish naturalists. He is botanically commemorated by the rosaceous genus Neillia. Neillia thibetica. Edinburgh is indebted to Neill for the scheme of the West Princes Street Gardens. In 1820, that portion of the north loch was drained, and five acres of ground were laid out and planted with seventy-seven thousand trees and shrubs under his direction. He also intervened to preserve several antiquities that were on the point of being demolished. Works In 1806 appeared his Tour through Orkney and Shetland, a work which gave rise to discussion because of its reports of poverty. In 1814 he issued a translation, An Account of the Basalts of Saxony, from the French of Dubuisson, with Notes, Edinburgh. He was the author of the article \\"Gardening\\" in the seventh edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and it was subsequently published as The Flower, Fruit, and Kitchen Garden (several editions). In 1817 Neill, with two other deputies from the Caledonian Society, made a tour through the Netherlands and the north of France, and he wrote an account of it, which was published in 1823.

Silting up and cliff collapses led to towns that had stood by the sea finding themselves landlocked, while others that had been inland found themselves with access to the sea. The city of Winchelsea on Romney Marsh was destroyed (later rebuilt on the cliff top behind). Nearby Broomhill was also destroyed. The course of the nearby river Rother was diverted away from New Romney, which was almost destroyed and left a mile from the coast, ending its role as a port. The Rother ran instead to sea at Rye, prompting its rise as a port. The storm contributed to the collapse of a cliff at Hastings, taking part of Hastings Castle with it, blocking the harbour and ending its role as a trade centre, though it continued as a centre for fishing. Whitstable in Kent is also reported to have been hit by the surge. In all, the storm can be seen to have had a powerful effect on the Cinque Ports, two of which were hit (Hastings and New Romney), along with the supporting \\"Antient Town\\" of Winchelsea. Meanwhile, the other Ancient Town of Rye was advantaged. The storm is one of two huge ones in England in 1287. The other was the one known in the Netherlands as St. Lucia's flood in December, the following winter. Together with a surge in January 1286, they seem to have prompted the decline of one of England's then leading ports, Dunwich in Suffolk.

In 1943, the city's independent institutions were eliminated altogether under the authoritarian T≈çj≈ç cabinet and the administration was absorbed by the appointed government of Tokyo prefecture.  Historical background  As one of the \\"three capitals\\" (santo) of Japan, Tokyo city was initially not allowed to elect its mayor when (albeit limited) local autonomy for Japanese municipalities was introduced in the Meiji era, mostly following a Prussian model. In the prefectures of Tokyo, ≈åsaka and Ky≈çto, the appointed Prefectural governor also took the role of mayor of the prefectural capital under a special imperial ordinance, the shisei tokurei (Â∏ÇÂà∂Áâπ‰æã). Elections for the city council and the prefectural assembly took place as in other parts of the country. When one of the major goals of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, a national-level parliamentary representation had been achieved in form of the Imperial Diet, its constitutional successor parties (mint≈ç, the \\"civil\\" or \\"democratic\\" parties opposed to the parties that supported the Meiji oligarchs in government) in the House of Representatives sought to repeal the Imperial ordinance that barred the three largest cities from having independent mayors; but resistance from the House of Peers kept the regulation alive until 1898 when the upper house passed its abolition. From then on the mayor of Tokyo city was appointed independently from the governor and prefectural and city administration were separated. Finally, beginning in the 1920s, the mayor was elected by the city council from among its members. Tokyo's Politics changed drastically during the 1950s when the U.S. completely redid the Gov. of Japan, turning it into a Democracy and rearranging the entire Edu. system, Government(as it was formerly an Empire), and more.  National representation  Tokyo city was initially represented by nine members in the House of Representatives, the elected lower house of the Imperial Diet: In the initial election of 1890, Tokyo city's wards were distributed over nine single-member electoral districts (Tokyo 1 to 9). In the early 20th century it elected eleven Representatives in the Tokyo city district. During the short return to single-member districts in the elections of 1920 and 1924, the city was covered by eleven single-member districts. After that, Tokyo city (in its pre-1932 borders) elected 18 Representatives in four districts. With the expansion of Tokyo city in 1932, it also extended into the 5th and 6th districts with five representatives each. As in many urban areas, liberal candidates from parties opposed to the dominating Seiy≈´kai were relatively successful in Tokyo city. In the 1930s, Tokyo elected some Socialist Representatives to the House. In the last mostly free, pre-war general election of 1937, candidates from the Socialist Mass Party (Shakai Taish≈´t≈ç) received the highest vote in Tokyo's 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th districts and finished second in the 3rd district, though a majority of votes and seats went to the Minseit≈ç with the Seiy≈´kai taking the second largest share.The Senkyo: 1937 House of Representatives general election results, Tokyo (note: The table of electoral districts uses the pre-1932 administrative divisions) One prominent exception from Minseit≈ç success in Tokyo city was Seiy≈´kai candidate Ichir≈ç Hatoyama (2nd district) who later sided with the \\"orthodox\\" faction (liberal wing led by Kuhara, opposed to the militarist \\"progressive\\" faction) in the Seiy≈´kai split of 1939 and went on to play a major role in occupation and postwar democratic politics.  Prefectural representation  As is the case today in designated cites, Tokyo city's wards served as multi-member electoral districts for the Prefectural Assembly electing up to five assemblymen in every district under the \\"three new regional laws\\" (chih≈ç-san-shinp≈ç) of 1878 that established the prefectural assemblies.  Mayor  Tokyo city's first independent mayor was Hideo Matsuda who was at the same time a Progressive member of the House of Representatives. He served until 1903 and was succeeded by Yukio Ozaki who is remembered in the United States for a gift of cherry trees that line the Potomac River in the District of Columbia. His nine-year administration also brought many improvements in infrastructure to Tokyo city. After that, Tokyo city had seven different mayors until 1926, none of whom served for longer than three years. Elected mayors of Tokyo city include former Bank of Japan governor Otohiko Ichiki, former Takushoku University president and Mie governor Hidejir≈ç Nagata and former Tokyo governor Toratar≈ç Ushizuka. Tokyo city's last mayor was a general of the Imperial Army, Ayao Kishimoto. Elected in August 1942, he oversaw the absorption of Tokyo city's independent institutions by the prefectural administration and in 1943 handed over to governor Shigeo ≈ådachi who was now directly responsible to the central government.  Council  The Tokyo city council (T≈çky≈ç-shikai) was established in 1889 together with the city itself. As in Osaka and Kyoto, it had to face a governor who acted as mayor and the pre-existing ward chiefs (ku-ch≈ç) who were also appointed, not elected. And since there was no independent city administration, the council's authority was very limited until the separation of prefectural and city executive in 1898.

Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295pp. By April 1947, all of the league's players were flown to Havana, Cuba for spring training. At the time, the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in the Cuban capital because Jackie Robinson, who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues, was training with the Dodgers for the first time. By then, city ordinances in Vero Beach, Florida, where the Dodgers normally trained, prevented blacks and whites players from competing on the same field against each other. Notably, newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their exhibition games at Estadio Latinoamericano than did the Dodgers.Cuban Baseball Home In addition to the eight team practices, early 55.000 Cuban fans attended a round-robin tournament which took place at Estadio Latinoamericano at the end of the training. The Racine Belles won the tournament and received a commemorative trophy from Esther Williams, American competitive swimmer and MGM movie star.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book All in all, the rules, strategy and general play were the same in 1947. The sidearm pitching was strictly used, as the league was moving toward full overhand delivery for the next season. The sidearm throwing allowed the hitters more of an advantage than previous seasons. Rockford's Dorothy Kamenshek repeated her batting crown with a .306 batting average in a close race with Audrey Wagner (.305) of Kenosha. Nevertheless, five no-hitters were recorded during the regular season by Racine's Doris Barr, Muskegon Erma Bergmann, Kenosha's Jean Cione, and Rockford's Margaret Holgerson and Betty Luna. The pitching highlight came from Muskegon's Doris Sams, who hurled the third perfect game in league history. In addition, P/OF Sams posted an 11-4 record and a 0.98 earned run average in 19 pitching appearances, while batting a combined average of .280 (97-for-346) in 107 total games. Following the season, Sams was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award.SABR Biography Project ‚Äì Doris Sams article by Jim Sargent At the end, Grand Rapids, Muskegon and Racine battled for the regular season title, until Muskegon got the victory with just two days remaining the schedule. Muskegon lost to Racine in the first round, three games to one, behind a strong pitching effort from Anna Mae Hutchison, who was credited with all three victories for Racine. By the other side, Grand Rapids defeated South Bend in five games guided by Connie Wisniewski, who pitched a win, stole home plate for another win, and collected an average of .318 (7-for-22). The second round was a tight fight, when the first three contests all went to extra innings and Grand Rapids held a 3-1 advantage in the best of seven series. But the defending champion Racine won the next two games to force a decisive game seven. In a pitching duel, Mildred Earp defeated Hutchison and the Belles on a 1‚Äì0, five hit shutout, while driving in the winning run to give Grand Rapids the championship. In 1947 average crowds at AAGPBL games were two to three thousand people, while attendance records were set in Muskegon, Peoria and Racine ballparks .

Its core was provided by the 8th Cretan Regiment and the newly raised 27th Infantry Regiment, formed from the 1st and 2nd Security Battalions of Thessaloniki. The division's third regiment, the 28th Infantry Regiment, was being formed in Thessaloniki, and arrived at Smyrna on 7 July, along with the divisional artillery and support services. The first commander was Colonel Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian. In November 1919, the 8th Cretan Regiment was replaced by the newly raised 30th Infantry Regiment. At about the same time, the Smyrna Division became part of the newly formed Smyrna Army Corps under Lt. General Dimitrios Ioannou, subordinate to the Army of Asia Minor. In 1920, the division participated in the Greek summer offensive, captured Balƒ±kesir and took part in the advance towards Bursa. From there the division were recalled to be used in a landing operation in support of the occupation of Eastern Thrace: the division was ferried from Asia and landed at Ereƒüli and Rodosto, and thence advanced north. After overcoming Turkish resistance at Lule Burgas, Babaeski and √áorlu and capturing the local Turkish commander, Cafer Tayyar, the division reached Adrianople. Returning to Asia, the Smyrna Division occupied positions around Bursa, and launched a series of raids against Turkish territory. Following the Venizelist defeat in the November 1920 elections, the division lost its commander, Mazarakis, who resigned. Shortly after, it was renamed to 10th Infantry Division by the new royalist government.

In January 1912, the brigades were abolished and divisions organized as triangular divisions. The 3rd Division remained at Missolonghi, but now comprised 6th Regiment (Missolonghi), 10th Regiment (Corfu), and 12th Regiment (Patras), plus supporting units. =Balkan Wars= At the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, the division was commanded by Major General Konstantinos Damianos. Consisting of three infantry regiments (6th, 10th and 12th), two squadrons of field artillery (1/3rd and 2/3rd), and one mountain artillery squadron (3rd), it was attached to the Army of Thessaly, commanded by Crown Prince Constantine. During the Battle of Sarantaporo on 9 October 1912, the 3rd Infantry Division, along with the 1st and 2nd, executed a frontal attack on Ottoman forces, across open ground. The Greek divisions suffered heavy casualties due to enemy artillery in the advance, but by night had reached the Turkish lines. Ottoman forces retreated when the 4th Infantry Division attacked the western flank of the Turkish Army and captured the Porta Pass.The Hellenic Army during the Balkan Wars 1912-1913, Volume 1, p. 60, (Hellenic Army General Staff, Army History Directorate, Athens 1988) =World War I= From 25 April 1918, the division fought in World War I on the Macedonian front, and remained active in the area around Lake Prespa until August 1920, when it was transferred to the Asia Minor Campaign. =Greco- Turkish War= In November 1920, the 3rd Infantry Division was part of the Army of Asia Minor during the Greco-Turkish War, assigned to the III Army Corps. Consisting of two infantry regiments (6th and 12th) and one light infantry regiment (2/39 Evzone), the division fought in the Battle of Sakarya and the Battle of Dumlupƒ±nar. =Interwar period= The 3rd Division was based at Patras as part of I Army Corps. By 14 October 1940 it was in the reserve of the Greek Army's three-corps defence against Italy during the Greco-Italian War.

In March 2007 Dr. Ngimbi Wasolwa of the General Hospital in Seke Banza said his facilities were overwhelmed by injured people, with no beds to receive further patients. The X-ray machine had not been working for a year, but due to the insecurity it was impossible to transfer patients by ambulance to Matadi. On 31 December 2010 police arrested 24 people in Kivava village and four more in Isangila sector of Seke-Banza territory. They were said to be former members of the Zairian Armed Forces (FAZ) from different parts of the country, and had been terrorizing the villagers. In May 2011 there were violent clashes between villagers of Tshela Territory to the north and villagers of Seke-Banza Territory, competing for access to agricultural land.

He represented Burnaby-Edmonds in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1975 to 1979 as a Social Credit member. Born in Steinbach, Manitoba, the son of Abraham Loewen, a funeral parlour operator, Loewen completed a degree in theology at Briercrest Bible College in Saskatchewan. When his father became ill, he took over the family business. He married Anne Heinrichs in 1962. In 1969, Loewen and his family moved to British Columbia. At that time, he also became involved in real estate and transportation. After leaving politics, Loewen was involved in real estate for a time. During the mid-1980s, he began acquiring Canadian funeral homes. In 1987, the Loewen Group expanded into the United States. By 1997, the company had 15,000 employees and operated 1,115 funeral homes. In 1995, a funeral home operator in Mississippi won $500 million in damages in a breach of contract suit. The large amount of punitive damages awarded relative to business assets not worth more than $4 million was criticized, but this setback led to a downturn in the company's fortunes. In 1998, Loewen stepped down as CEO and sold his shares in the company. The Loewen Group filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999; in 2002, it was restructured as the Alderwoods Group.. In 2006, Alderwoods board of directors sold Alderwoods to SCI (Service Corporation International), an American Funeral Corporation. In 2008, Loewen's Twin Cedars estate in Burnaby was listed for sale at $25 million (Canadian), and was sold June 2012 for $9.948 million.
